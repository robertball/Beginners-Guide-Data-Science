This is the actual recipe from Skyline. It was printed in the Cincy Inquirer in the early 70s. I use ground turkey instead of beef and the flavor and texture are the same (my wife says my version is better!). May need to make a batch soon!

I grew up in Cincinnati and our chili of choice was Gold Star. For close to 20 years I have been searching for a decent Cincy chili recipe to no avail...until I found this one! I did augment the recipe to make it more like Gold Stars. (Skyline is more "earthy" than I like) I added hot water every 1/2 hour or so- maybe 1/2 cup every time to mellow it out and keep it from getting too thick. I also added ~ 2 teaspoons of light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. The result was more like Gold Star's chili recipe which is my preference. Thank you for posting this recipe...it quells my craving at least until I make the trip back home to Cincinnati!

Tastes JUST like Skyline Chili!  We don't live in Ohio anymore, so this was a perfect taste of home.  Wouldn't change a thing- don't even miss the fat!

I had grabbed ground allspice instead of the berries-- so FYI- 1t. of ground=5 berries-- so you need 1t. ground allspice if you don't have berries.

Having lived most all of my life in the Cincinnati area, I am very familiar with the Cincy style chili. Skyline Chili was my chili of choice. For a long time I have hoped for a recipe which would replicate this area favorite.  Well, with this recipe, I think my search has finally ended.  I followed the recipe as outlined,except using allspice powder instead of berries and unsweetened cocoa powder instead of chocolate squares.  I didn't overnight the beef in the fridge after cooking.  I just carefully skimmed the fat from the top after giving it time to separate from the water.  Giving it a taste a couple of hours into the cooking, I gave it a shake or two more of chili powder and a couple more pinches of allspice.  And that was it.  After the three hours of cooking and boiling a pot of spaghetti, I sat down to the truest reproduction of the "real thing" as I have ever had.  If you try this recipe, be patient.  You need the whole three hours of cooking to fully merge all of the flavors and to get that true Cincinnati Chili taste.  As the recipe noted might be necessary, I had to occasionally add a little water during simmering to keep the consistency and to prevent it from sticking.  If you do these things, you will be rewarded for your efforts.  We priced a container of Skyline while in the grocery today and it was a staggering $6.89!!  Never again will we have to spend this outrageous price for a great local chili taste.  Many, many thanks for this recipe.

I live in Milwaukee, WI and I used to work at a chili restaurant in the Third Ward that specialized in Cincinnati Chili.  I fell in love with it but unfortunately the owner of that place is bat- crazy... so I'd advise not going there.  This recipe tastes exactly like the stuff at the restaurant!  Exactly!  And the part that's better?  Since you skim the fat, your leftovers don't have a thick orange layer on top when they come out of the fridge!  There's no point in using lean ground beef since you'll boil the fat out so just buy the cheapest one.  Enjoy!

This was awesome and tasted soooo much like the real thing, but without the grease! I did not have whole cloves or the allspice berries, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of ground. I did take another's advice and used beef broth instead of water, and it was saltier than I'd like. I will use water next time!   THANK YOU THANK YOU Melissa for this great recipe!!

I have been using Allrecipes.com for 3-4 years now and have never had incidence with a 5-star recipe before.  I created an account SPECIFICALLY to review this recipe.  I had Skyline chili yesterday and this chili has a hint of the same flavor, but it is not the same recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly and neither my husband nor I could finish our bowls. I'd try one of the Skyline seasoning packets or another recipe on this site.

I'm from Cincinnati and enjoyed Skyline chili my whole life.   This recipe is the closest to the original Skyline taste and texture of any I've tested.  Great recipe - Great chili.

I'm from the Cincinnati area and this is dead-on!  The only changes I made was instead of allspice berries, used 1/4 teaspoon of ground allspice, and instead of whole cloves, used 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves, and used 2 teaspoons of garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves.  Loved it, we had it over spaghetti noodles with finely shredded cheddar cheese.  Yum, this is going to be a regular menu item.  Thanks for sharing

The first time I prepared this recipe, a few months ago, was the very first time I ever had Cincinnati chili and I prepared it as a "five-way," with spaghetti, chili, onions, beans and shredded Cheddar.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the chocolate (none on hand) and I used 1 tsp. of ground allspice instead of the whole berries.  It was quite delicious, and in tasting the chili, I noticed that it was remarkably like the chili sauce used at one of my all-time favorite Worcester, MA haunts, George's Coney Island Hot Dogs, an institution in that city for almost one hundred years.  So, while the chili with the spaghetti, et al, is great, I have been making batches of the chili to freeze to have on hand to make my own "Coney Dogs," Kayem Skinnies slathered with this sauce, yellow mustard and minced white onions on a New England style hot dog roll.  I even give this sauce away as gifts, it is so popular.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  Only let it sit in the fridge a few hours; it was difficult to skim the fat but worked fine.  Made with cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate.  Tasted even better the next day.

I prepared this chili for a tailgate in Cincinnati (Browns v Bengals). It was awesome! I served it 4-way (over spaghetti with chopped onions, cheese and oyster crackers). Even the local Cincinnatians gave their enthusiastic approval. They said it tasted like their famous Skyline chili, only a little spicier....which they liked. The only problem with this recipe is the serving amount. I bumped it up to 15 servings to allow for seconds, but I don't think more than 10-12 bowls were served. If you're serving 6-8 people you need to double the recipe. It really cooks down when it's finished and you're definitely going to have people coming back for more!

Not being from Cincinnati- I tried this.  My husband and I are both adventuresome eaters but neither of us liked this.  The blend of spices- cinnamon, cloves, allspice is not what we liked.  I won't make this again.  Perhaps its something you like if you grew up on it.

A friend from Ohio introduced us to Cincinnati style chili by bringing back a few cans of Skyline. It was delicious but I cringed at the fat content on the label and the greasy residue left in the pan. I chose this recipe over all of the other ones like it because I wanted a healthier version. However, as you might guess, removing fat also diminishes flavor. I still give it five stars because it is the best one to start with, and you can just increase or adjust seasoning to taste. I increased some of the seasonings and added a cube of beef boullion and was able to fool our friend into thinking that I had opened another can. Another good point is that although the texture and consistency is like Skyline's, this version is actually meatier.

Wonderful dish! I added a bit of extra spices as per my preference. One addition to the procedure that makes a world of difference - before serving, put about a fourth of the chili in a blender for a few seconds and then return to the pot. YUM!

So yummy.  Never had this kind of chili before...and I dig it.  So did everyone else.  Made as shown only making substitutions suggested by others...cocoa for chocolate and allspice for berries.  Awesome.

Made this AGAIN this past week-end for Chili dogs on Monday....I make a double so I can freeze some to use again. This is the BEST chili on a dog you can ask for....and it's dang good on it's own as well. I'm sorry, I'm not from Cinci, nor have I had Cincinnati chili in the past so I can't compare, but this recipe is FANTASTIC AS IS!!

My 16-year old son absolutely loved this and wants me to make it every week.  He says it is just like the Steak and Shake chili that we love.  I followed the recipe as written except substituting 1 T. cocoa powder for the chocolate.  I am planning to double the recipe next time.  Maybe I will have a little left for excellent coney dogs!

I'm from Cinci and Skyline is my fave.  No recipe will ever match the real deal, but this is very close.  I used 1 t. ground allspice since I don't have the berries, 2T cocoa powder instead of real chocolate, and cider vinegar instead of regular.  I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate to get the fat off.  Using 93% lean hamburger, there wasn't any fat to speak of, and what little there may have been would've only enhanced the flavor.  I did have to keep adding more water as it cooked.  This recipe was just a tad more meaty than Skyline's.  Theirs has a bit more water/grease for saturating the oyster crackers!  It is absolutely necessary to finely shred mild cheddar cheese right before serving.  The pre-packaged shredded cheddar isn't soft enough.  Also, must serve with oyster crackers.  One last note: make sure your dog doesn't eat any plate leftovers that go in the garbage.  Gives them serious diarrhea.  Guess it's not much different than getting some Skyline after drinking all night, LOL.

So delicious!!  As an Ohio native no longer living in OH, it was so great to eat a taste of home.  I added 1 Tbs extra Cinnamon as well as 1 tsp Nutmeg and 2 Tbs sugar to the pot.  I took this chili to a party and the crockpot was scraped clean!!

I've never had Cincinnati Chili before... but we went all out for it and it was very good. We had spaghetti, cheese, and onions.  I might make it again if I get a hankering.

Very, very close to the Skyline Chili I remember. Texture is spot on. Next time I'll reduce the chocolate by a third and up the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves a bit. Good stuff!

i had to change this a little to fit what i had on hand and the amount of time i had. i scaled this down to 5. i boiled the beef, drained and rinsed  it, then added 2 C water to cover and simmered 30 mins. then i added the rest of the ingredients. i did not have any baking chocolate on hand so i used unsweetened cocoa powder and it worked fine.  i also did not have any allspice berries so i added an extra clove instead. i used a tea ball to infuse the clove flavor then removed it at the end.  i  had to add a little water as it simmered. i tried it after 1 hr 30 mins and felt that was long enough for me. even with all of these changes i dont feel it changed the outcome too much. i look forward to trying this w/ the allspice berries next time.  i garnished it w/ pinto beans, sharp cheddar cheese, light sour cream, and red onion.

As someone else wrote, this is an acquired taste. The cloves and allspice were over-powering. If I had to do it again, I'd cut both by half, but I don't think I'll have that opportunity.

This stuff is "weapons grade" delicious...The only thing different used was low sodium beef stock instead of the water...everything else was as directed. This tasted like it took 2 days to make....come to think of it....it did.....

I lived in Cincinnati in the 70's and became addicted to Cincinnati Chili.  So when it came time to move to California I had scoured for the best recipe.  This is the exact same recipe I have been using since 1978.  Its great for Chili Cheese dogs too!!!

I'm sorry, I don't usually give negative reviews but we just didn't care for this.  I guess I'm used to the spicy chili with beans we make here in the mid-west.  The cinnamon especially tasted strange to us in a chili.  I liked the method for cooking the beef and skimming the fat and I plan to use that in my chili recipe from now on.

This chili is really great!  Although my husband and I love spicy food, I had to modify the amount of chili powder to accommodate our 2 year old daughter.  We put in 1 teaspoon chili powder along with the 1/2 teaspoon cayenne peeper called for in the recipe.  It was very full of flavor.  My husband said this is the best chili he has ever had and he knows that he will be craving it soon.  We will definitely make it again.

This has become one of family's favorite meals. I make it every month we love it so much! I don’t have time usually to follow the recipe exactly so for a short cut I cook the onions and beef together then add beef stock, about 4 cups and let it simmer for about 15 min. before adding all the other ingredients. To speed up the cooking time use 1/2 tsp ground allspice and cloves. It may not be the same but it will cut the entire process down to about an hour and a half. Fantastic recipe!

This is very tasty!  I used beef broth instead of water to cook the meat, and only half of an onion, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I can't wait to try it on hot dogs and hamburgers!  Just like the East coast type chili I remember as a child. Great recipe!  Thanks!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe but I wanted something like Skyline.  This did not disappoint!  I didn't have any cloves so I just used a little more allspice (ground, didn't even know they were berries).  I also added a dash of turmeric, coriander, and nutmeg as I saw it used in other similar recipes.  I also only had one small can of tomato sauce (oops) so I added a small can of tomato paste and extra water.  Everything else, I used according to the recipe.  I may have cooked the meat too quickly because I broke up several big chunks during the three hour simmer but it was still great and the texture came together in the last hour.  I also added kidney beans a few minutes before serving since that's how I like it.  It def took some time but was well worth it!

Super tasty.  My husband and I love this recipe.  I didn't have allspice berries, so I added 1 teaspoon of ground allspice and I also didn't have whole cloves, so I used 1 teaspoon of ground cloves.  It was amazing!!!

I didn't find scraping the fat necessary. I just cooked the meat in the water (which is very necessary to break up the meat) then drained all the excess liquid off. I added a bouillon cube back to the pan and put fresh water back into the chili, then just continued that way. No need to wait overnight, in my opinion... though *after* everything is cooked, it truly is better the next day.

I am from Ohio and now live in Iowa. We don't have any GoldStars or Skyline chili's around so it is so nice to make it at home. They do have packets ( in Ohio at least that I know of) at the store that you can buy, but let me tell you that this is better. Don't make any changes to this! It is perfect as is!!!!!

I've made this about 20 times...looked for years for a recipe similar to the Cincinnati chili at Hard Times Cafe in Alexandria, Virginia and this one is spot on! LOVE IT!! 

To folks giving this bad reviews because it doesn't taste like 'regular/normal chili' - it's NOT supposed to. Cincinnati / Skyline Chili has a unique and different flavor and no, it's not for everyone. But please don't give this a bad review because it's not like 'regular/normal' chili! That's like making a Chicken Noodle Soup recipe and saying it was bad because it didn't taste like  Chicken Curry Soup!! Just sayin'! ;)

The only adjustment I made was rather than refrigerating overnight, I just poured the meat/water into a fine strainer after boiling the meat and started with fresh water. This removed a lot of the fat and I just adjusted the seasoning a bit to my taste (sprinkle more chili powder, sprinkle more cumin, salt, cayenne) during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Turned out great!

Better than Skyline and Gold Star!  I made this with 1# ground beef instead of 2# and left out the cloves.  Spectacular!  A little spicy, sour, savory.  Great improvement (dare I say) over the local Cinti chains...

I was in a real rush to get this on the table so I didn't put it in the fridge overnight.  I was able to boil the meat then drain and rinse in a colander to get the fat off.  I added water to the level of the meat then put the rest of the ingredients in and simmered for 1.5 hours.  It turned out great!  I did this recipe 10X, yes I said ten, for a group of 100 this summer just like instructed and it was the hit of the swim team meals!  Thanks for bringing Cinci to Houston!

I'd never heard of Cincinnati chili before I saw this recipe. While it was cooking, I have to admit I was skeptical. It smelled like a combination between apple pie and beef. As it turns out, the finished product is fantastic! I have no idea if the recipe is 'authentic' but I do know that it is absolutely delicious.

This is such a true recipe! I did not have the berries, so I used the allspice powder. I did not have whole cloves but used ground cloves. I also used a large can of tomato paste and added waster to a large bowl first stirred it around really good. I also made a triple batch . Hands down ! this is the closest you will ever come to Cincinnati chili! What the other person do to there batch that it came out so darn bad not sure. I also skipped the frig part I strained my meat in a fine wire strainer and ran water over it to get ll the fat off.!

I loved this recipe. I have never had Skyline's chili, so I can't compare, but this is certainly a keeper!! It has such depth of flavor. I can't wait for fall when I can comfortably eat this again (summertime and 100+ degrees!).

Excellent chili, added to my 3 or 4 different chilis I make. Substituted a can of tomatoes and green chilis for the tomato sauce, substituted 3 Tablespoon cocoa for the chocolate, did n't have the chocolate squares. Left out the garlic, felt 4 were too many.

I am from Ohio, and this is the best!  The method of cooking beef in water, is exactly the texture you are looking for in "skyline" chili.  The native way is over spaghetti, also great as a footlong chili dog, chili topped burgers, or any other way you can think of to use a thick chili.

My husband and I have seen this Chili on a couple of different TV shows and were really looking forward to trying this. I stuck to the recipe exactly, except used ground instead of whole spices as someone else suggested. I served it over spaghetti with cheddar cheese, and the next day on hotdogs. This seems to be an acquired taste, as we didn't care for it at first. It was after several bites and a few good shakes of hot sauce that we decided we liked it, just didn't love it. :(

The flavor and texture was spot-on for Cinci Chili.  I did change the cooking procedure - the next day I put it in the crock pot to cook all day.  It was a little bit water.  I skimmed off some of the water and put it back in the fridge.  The next day I heated it up on the stove and the consistency was perfect.  If I made it again in a crock pot I think I would use less water in the first step.

This is a great recipe.  Boiling the meat the night before is a clever way of eliminating all of the fat.  My husband was affraid of the chocolate in the recipe but he was a believer once he tried it.  The chocolate adds a rich flavor.  I made the recipe as is but I did add a can of kidney beans because we like beans in our chili.  Fantasic!

Full disclosure: I'm not from Cincinnati, have never been to Cincinnati, nor have I ever had Skyline Chili. However, a diner in Upstate NY offers this dish and it's delicious so I sought out a recipe, ultimately choosing this one. I measured everything to spec with the exception of whole cloves or allspice berries, which I didn't have. I have ground. Several people in the reviews have stated that 1 tsp ground = 5 whole cloves/ berries and that's the measurement I went with. BIG MISTAKE. The clove-taste dominated this dish. Cinnamon? Cayenne? Salt? Could barely taste 'em; it was all cloves, all the time. Despite that, the outcome was still pretty good. My suggestions for improvements: ease up on the clove use when using ground. If you don't have whole cloves, use 1/2 - 3/4 tsp ground. Also, do NOT use 93% ground beef for this as I did. This chili needs some of that delicious fat, so go 85% or lower. This recipe got me on the right track for what I'm looking for so, for that, thank you.

I followed the recipe to the exact and what came out tasted nothing like what I was expecting, didn't smell like it either(which probably would have helped). If you're planning on making this from nothing, meaning you gotta buy all the ingredients, I would rethink that. Buying all the ingredients to make this costs me over $60. Yeah, I got enough left to make it a few more times but that's definitely not going to happen. If you're just gonna throw it over spaghetti or hot dogs, just buy the cans at the grocery .....

I have made this recipe about 6 times and according to my father, who grew up in Cincinnati, this is it! I make this without the refrigeration though, I just drain and rinse with cold water, much faster. I use 3tbsp cocoa instead of the solid chocolate, and a teaspoon each of cloves and allspice instead of the whole cloves and allspice berries. I also add in a can of kidney beans to cook with the chili, much better than serving on top. 

I had the problem of it burning on the bottom no matter how low I turned the heat. Might just be my pan, but I found a way around it! I brown the meat in a pan and drain/rinse, then I combine all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook on high all day, stirring every 3hours, perfect chili every time!

I made this Sunday/Monday and I will preface this review by saying that my only exposure with this style of 'chili' is via the frozen Skyline 2-way microwavable meal and a "Cincinnati Style" chili dry seasoning mix. However, I enjoyed both of those and wanted to go fresher.

I made the recipe as-is, with the only change being to portion size. I boiled Angus 85-15 beef as directed and let it sit overnight to solidify the fat. I also pre-mixed all of the dry ingredients and pre-chopped the onions to make it easier to dump everything in a slow cooker on a workday morning. We don't care for the consistency of onions in my house, so I used a food processor to very finely chop the onions and garlic together, using the vinegar and worchestershire sauce to help. 

Overall, I liked the flavor, but not the wateriness. Next time, I will follow what some others did and just rinse the beef in a colander or wire strainer. Then I will probably use reduced sodium beef broth to add as much liquid as needed. I will also fresh-grind the cloves and allspice berries just prior to adding, instead of cooking them whole. The flavor was lacking something (based on my limited experience disclaimer at the top), so I will work on it next time. 4 stars from me. Thanks for reading.

I basically followed the recipe but made a few minor changes.  This turned out a little more spicy than I like.  My husband (who's from Cincinnati) said it has a Skyline flavor with Goldstar spiciness.  
My mods: 1) I did not do the overnight skim thing, I used grass fed ground beef which doesn't have enough fat to make that step worth my time. 2) I used 1/4 t ground clove in place of whole clove. 3) I used 1 t ground allspice in place of allspice berries. 4) I used 3 T cocoa powder in stead of the square.  5) I forgot the bay leaf!
I would definitely make this again but cut back on the amount of chili powder.

I did not take two days to make this, however I did remove fat from the hamburger meat.  I also did not boil the meat, I browned it with the onions.  Then I removed the fat with a turkey baster.  Great recipe!!

We loved this! I've made it twice so far. I used a 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 2 Tbl  cocoa powder.  I boiled the ground beef in the morning then refrigerated  it about 4 hrs then scraped the grease off the top. Although I love the idea of getting rid of the grease, I think I should leave a little on for flavor and to stick to the spaghetti better. It makes the house smell great as it cooks. The onions shouldn't be added in  as you cook it. They should be served raw on top.

This is the real deal!  We need very low sodium for health reasons - without the salt,you need to cut back on the cinnamon (by about half), but otherwise, it works!  Yay!

Wanting Cincinnati chili similar to one a regional chain in MD and VA (!) serves,  this recipe seemed the best. Hint: after adding water to the beef in the pan, an old fashioned “squiggly” potato masher makes the beef VERY finely chopped very quickly.

Two small changes for next time: 1) The clove flavor was a bit too strong, although I folllowed the ground clove to whole clove equivalent and even subtracted a bit. 1/8 tsp. should equal about one clove, and I multiplied by 4 instead of 5. Still too much. And 2) no need to keep the ground beef in the frig overnight - just until any fat rises to the top, which is then very easy to “peel” off with a spoon or spatula. All in all a really nice dish. Will make it a bunch. Oh - and I added about 1.5 tsps of brown sugar like some others.

We are all big fans of Cincinnati Chili (which is not often served   at restaurants here in Washington DC), so I made this one.  It was delicious and very easy (as long as you remember you need to start the evening before to let the meat chill in the refrigerator overnight.)  I may try a bit more chocolate and cinnamon next time as the sweet/spiciness ratio was a bit more on the spicy side and I'm curious what upping those two ingredients would taste like.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe.  Remember the beef will look gross until it all comes together.

Changes: 2 TB chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground coves, skipped allspice( suggested 1 tsp ground) and bay leaves (2)

Made this VEGETARIAN style. Instead of ground beef, used 1 bag of Morningstar Farms or Boca Burger crumbles (12 ounces). Put in enough water to cover the crumbles and let simmer for 15-20 minutes while the remainder of spices were prepared and used half of the spice recommendation since I was only using 12 ounces of crumbles. Use entire spice recommendation if using 2 bags of crumbles. I then let the mixture simmer for 30-40 minutes which boiled off a little bit of the water and made a nice chili texture. Let sit in refrigerator overnight for spices to absorb and served that following evening. Even the non vegetarians loved the VEGETARIAN version. Halving it made 6 filling dishes. If you want to make the VEGAN version of this, leave out the worcheshire sauce (contains anchovies), use diaya vegan cheese, and make sure your pasta is vegan.

Made it all in a day and although probably better over two days, it still tasted great! One comment was to add water while simmering but we careful not to add too much because it makes the chili runny. Over angel hair or a coney, this definitely tastes like the real thing!

After 2 years in California and 3 years in New Mexico, I've become a bit of a chili fanatic. This is my first taste of Cincinnati chili and while it's very different from, say, carne adovada, I'm now a fan! I used ground NM red chile instead of chili powder, ground allspice instead of the berries and half a Mexican hot chocolate disk instead of the unsweetened (all due to the contents of my cupboard). Served over spaghetti with a touch of sharp white cheddar and some onion. Next time I'll make sure I have mild orange and oyster crackers on hand so I can do it up right. Here's to chili in all its incarnations!

This is a great recipe exactly as is but I used allspice powder and ground cloves. I posted the recipe under my profile with these slight modifications.

This is it! After fond memories of spending a long summer working in Cincinnati and going out to Skyline every Friday with my colleagues, I have been wracked with Skyline Chili cravings ever since. (No Goldstar, thank you! Although Goldstar was better on hot dogs, if I recall.) The cans of Skyline do not cut it, with their metallic tinge. The off-brand packets are not even close. I made this almost exactly as written, and it was perfect. The key - do not skim the fat. Put in extra fat if you use lean ground beef.  1) That's where the flavor is. 2) Fat is good for you - read Nourishing Traditions or Eat Fat, Lose Fat, or anything by Mary Enig. Low fat is what's making us fat - fat is what allows us to absorb vitamins. (And I used grassfed ground beef for the beefiest flavor and best nutritional profile.) Anyway, I served this on top of spaghetti with raw onions and oyster crackers. Then I froze what was left and later made the Skyline Chili Dip (layer with cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and onion) and served with french fries for dipping. (Fried in healthy grassfed beef tallow.) It was unbelievably good, and even my picky husband has asked for more. Thank you for this recipe! I had almost given up on Skyline chili at home, after several random internet recipes had failed, and even the Cook's Illustrated version was a bust. Thank you thank you thank you thank you. [Modifications: Do not skim the fat for best flavor. Unsweetened cocoa powder, ground cloves and ground allspice.]

I love Cincinnati chilli.  Ive tried several recipes for this but this one is by far my favorite  I'm from the UK so I had no experience with this type of chilli, but this also meant I had no preconceptions of how it should taste.  I love Greek and Lebanese food and this has similar flavour to dishes from that part of the world. When i lived in DC, our circle of friends were from all across the US snd from many countries of the world  We frequently had potlucks and had people bring in an authentic recipe from their part of the world.  Our Indianapolis friend brought Cincinnati chilli.  She gave me the recipe and I lost it.  After I moved away from DC I also lost touch with her, so I have spent some time trying to find a recipe that compared to hers and this is the closest one I've found. Those expecting texas style chilli are going to be disappointed since this is very different  I did not make any changes to this other than that I used lean beef and didn't see the need to remove the fat. Rather than spend 3 hours simmering this on the stovetop, I cooked it in my crockpot for 5 hours on low and it came out great. It tastes even better the next day and can easily be frozen.  I am a single person so I make half the recipe and then halve the results of that  One half of this I use for two meals and one half I freeze for two future meals. This is a very economical dish with lots of flavor.

My great aunt in Cincinnati clipped this recipe out of the paper decades ago and I've used it ever since. Sometimes I tinker with it and add kidney beans, and use diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

My husband developed a beef allergy as an adult (can you say PAIN!), so we assumed our skyline days were over. We decided to try this recipe with ground turkey, and we were AMAZED by how close it tasted to the real thing. I did not think it stood a chance, but I honestly did not taste the difference. That said, you have to put the cooked turkey through a food processor to break it down into those time pieces, or it would just not be the right consistency. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! So flavorful... I used regular allspice as I had no allspice berries and browned the beef and slow cooked it for about 7 hours. To get the fine texture I used an immersion blender, which worked great. I served it over spaghetti with a mound of finely grated cheddar and oyster crackers. This is a great recipe to freeze for future meals.

Used ground cloves (1/4 tsp), ground allspice (1/4 tsp), garlic powder (2t), and cocoa powder (2T).  Didn't have tomato sauce, so blended canned tomato in the food processor and added tomato paste.  Served over spaghetti with cheddar cheese.  Yummy!

My sister in Law bulked at me when she heard that I brought Cincinnati chili to our family function. She grew up on Skyline Chili and says that she's never found another place that serves authentic Cincinnati chili. But once she tried this recipe she actually said: " This is pretty close". I consider that high praise.

FINALLY! This is IT!! It was 23 years ago at Miami U in beautiful Ohio that our then-boogie band, “Peach Melba”, had Skyline for lunch near the campus. I was hooked but didn’t have it again for many years- and it was from the frozen section in the grocery store- FULL OF STUFF I don’t want, including the salt content.
Now, the closest Skyline Chili is a two-hour drive. About the amount of time it’s taking to read this review... I’d just have to learn to make it. Now to track down the best and closest recipe!!! Allrecipes!!! Thank you, and now I’m hungry. 
DELICIOUS, and SPOT on.
I followed measurements exactly (for once!) EXCEPT I halved the salt.
Had to use ground turkey due to diet restrictions and beef is definitely my preference but turkey was very very good in this. 
CHEESE can freeze, so I $pring for Sargento off the block medium cheddar, ziplock the leftover and freeze. Same for any extra chili! Also a first, it simmered on super-low for hours, I added 1/2 c water twice, made a huge improvement for texture and flavor. THANK YOU FOR SHARING this delicious “Just Like...”!

This is a great recipe. Delicious!!

This is the only recipe for Chile that my husband likes. We make it to use as Hotdog Sauce. This is so good. 

What you buy in the grocery store is usually made with soy and there is not really any meat in them.

Try this you will love it, There are only 2 of us, so I either cut it in half or make it all and freeze it n smaller containers.

I had doubts but it was a close to the real thing as I can get. Not exact but just as good in its own right. Love those aromatic flavors.  I don't really eat pasta anymore but this turned out so good I'm using it in a 4 way tomorrow! To heck with low carb for one day lol.  Thanks for sharing this treasure. I didn't have Worcester sauce so I used a steak sauce I got in Mexico when on vacation.  Also I did thicken it slightly during the last 20 minutes of simmer by adding just a touch of masa mixed in warm water.

I tried Cincinnati Chili years ago.  I used this recipe and it  brought back the wonderful aromas and intricate balances of seasonings for the best chili!  I'm making it for a chili cook-off at our local church.  It will be a crowd pleaser.

Everyone has said it all. We loved this filling and warming meal. We added the 5 WAY options, Cheese, Pasta, Kidney Beans and Onions. OH MY MY!! The only thing I would let everyone know is that this feeds 4-5 people with one good serving two each with smaller servings.

I skipped the first step, and went for it with fat included (did use extra lean). It was dead on, loved it. Grew up in the Cincy area ( live out West now) and had tried to replicate the recipe many times over the years and came close. All the onion was what I was missing. Thanks a million for the recipe it’s perfect.

This is the only Cincy chili recipe that cooks the beef properly.  It is to be cooked in simmering water and broken apart into fine pieces of beef.  The meat should never be browned.  To simplify the recipe, I add extra water in the beginning break apart the meat, then add everything else.  I use very lean meat so there is very little fat.  The I simmer for at least

This was very authentic. We used ground Allspice and Ground Clove in the recipe. We needed to short-cut the time so we drained the beef in a fine colander and cooked the chili for about 2 1/2 hours. Served on an oval plate spaghetti/Chili/Onion/Beans/Cheese and about half a bottle of crystal added as we worked our way across the plate section by section so you got all 5 ingredients in every bite.

Don't live in Ohio and have never had Cincinnati chili. Having said that, , this stuff is GOOD! After I boiled the ground beef, I used my immersion blender to obtain the fine consistency. Followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have whole allspice or cloves so use ground instead. Piled on top of spaghetti, with raw chopped onions and a huge pile of very finely shredded cheddar cheese, this is my idea of heaven on a plate. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Thanks so much for sharing. Now I don't have to go to Cincy, so it's a win-win.

This is now winter-time comfort food at our house.  I'm from Texas, and thought my husband had lost his mind years ago when he came home with a can of skyline chili from a business trip.  Well, I liked it enough to search for a recipe and make it at home.  I still like my Texas chili, too, don't get me wrong.  But sometimes my tummy can't handle the hot spices of a good ole bowl of Texas chili and just wants warm and comfy chili.  Like this.  We love it!

Very good for chili cheese tots, Dogs etc. I didn't bother with cooking it and letting it sit over night, then skim, to get that pure true drive in chili sauce feel.

Spot on!  I spent the first decade of my life in Cincinnati, still have family there.   I use to have my parents send me spice packets to make Cincinnati chili but decided to take it on myself.   This recipe nails it.     I have made a few modifications though.   I use 90/10 ground beef and skip the skimming.   I feel that cooking the meat with the spices helps steep in the flavor.    I only use one large onion finely chopped, don't skimp on the garlic, and add a little additional salt.   I have also found that tomato paste  give a better flavor profile than sauce.

We live right on the Ohio border, and used to drive into Eaton just to get out Skyline fix. We finally got one in town, and it went out of business! I was reduced to buying cans or frozen (expensive and not as good!) Until I found this. I've tried other versions, and honestly this comes closest. 
 This recipe is so close that I make a double batch, and freeze half. The kids can heat some up for Coney's whenever they want, and I can get my 4-way fix.
I do, after skimming the fat, use my immersion blender to get that extra fine texture. That texture really does make a big difference in the final product.

This recipe was delicious and was exactly what I was looking for. It was also easy to make. I froze half so I could have easy dinners and lunches for some time. Think the kids are going to love it. I am a Cincinnati native who has been gone for many many years, and have experimented with many different recipes. I will say that I wasn't expecting much when I boiled the meat as the first step. The approach was much different from other types of cooking I've done. But it worked and was very accurate.

I made the following adjustments:
Did not skim the fat or let it congeal overnight. 
1 lb ground beef. 1 lb ground lamb.
Forgot the bay leaf.
After initial boil, transferred to a slow cooker and let simmer for 12 hours, then put in fridge overnight to consume the next day. 

This recipe is LEGIT. Yum!

This is one of those "I signed up for AllRecipes just to review this one" kind of story.  I browse this site frequently, though truth be told I'm not a devoted follower of any one recipe site. Still, I find myself here frequently, and it's time I shared my gratitude.

First of all, I do not claim to be from Cincinnati, nor even the area, so I can't say how 'authentic' this is.  I will say I've eaten at Skyline about every time I've been through that town, and I don't know that I would call this their actual recipe (regardless of whatever had previously been printed).

Still, my experience with Cincy style chilis definitely puts this one up there as a regional recipe, there is no doubt.  And my modifications did not hurt the overall final product.

I did not see the part about starting it the day before, so that was problem one.  Solution?  Simple.  Brown the meat without the water, drain the fat off, then go right into the onion saute.  BE SURE TO ADD MORE WATER LATER, THOUGH.  Since I don't know how much of the original quart of H2O remains after a three hour simmer and chilling overnight, I started with half that amount.  I think I added another cup later, so three cups total, but please don't quote me on that.  Besides, the nice part about this method is, you get to decide how tight or loose you want the chili to be.

Otherwise, I used the ingredients and method down to the T, and it was amazing.  I would definitely make this again!

I ALWAYS stop for Cincinnati Skyline Chili whenever passing through. If I don't I hear about it for some time afterward. Our entire family loves it, and I get orders by text when they know I'm near Cincinnati. It is an acquired taste, I think.
This recipe comes so close to the original, but isn't quite there.  I've been playing around with the ingredients but find this is still better.
I rarely refrigerate the meat overnight. I find that a few hours is just fine for me to skim the fat. Also, DON'T BROWN THE MEAT or you will not get that Skyline type chili. 
Thanks so much!

This is THE chili. I lived in Cincy long ago. Then one day a few years ago I woke up with the urge to eat this chili. And this recipe makes the same chili you get at Skyline. It’s incredible.

Tastes like the Skyline Chili I grew up with!

I highly recommend that after cooking, you let the finished chili sit in the fridge at least a day.

Tastes dead on with Skyline!  if people don't like it they don't like it, but this is the recipe if you're looking for the Skyline taste. 

 Two recommendations -separate the liquid from the ground beef before you put in in the fridge. Makes it easier to separate.   Also be sure to pull out the cloves and allspice berries and bay leaf before serving.  

I found that one lb of spaghetti wasn't enough for this recipe.  make two pounds or cut the recipe in half.  And a little bit of beans goes a long way.  One or two cans drained and rinsed would be plenty or abt a 1/4 bag of dry beans.

I'm not sure what the point is in skimming the fat. You lose a lot of flavor that way, and there's no health benefit to it (see a plethora of recent research on the lack of a real link between dietary fat and cholesterol and heart disease). 

It needs a bit more of...something. The flavor balance is right, so I think possibly adding half again as much of every flavoring agent, from the spices to the vinegar, would do it.

We recently returned from Cincinnati where we ate at Skyline Chili. We loved their chili  so I decided to try and duplicate it here in Texas.   This recipie was a tad spicier than what we experienced  in Ohio. It was really good.  I will make this again for my family.

This is awesome!
I tried Skyline Chili about 20 years ago when they briefly opened a few restaurants in Florida. I was hooked after a few visits, but they promptly closed.
I have since been able to buy the canned chili, but the fat content makes it only possible to enjoy on a rare occasion.
I've tried a couple other recipes, and while close, they just weren't right.
This recipe is perfect! The only difference I made was boiling the beef, and then rinsing it in a colander lined with cheesecloth to eliminate the fat. After that, I threw it into the electric pressure cooker, and put in on the soup function with the remaining ingredients exactly.
Perfection!

The original 1946 recipe for Skyline, not Cincinnati chili, has no chili powder included.  You can do about whatever you want ,within reason , to Cincy Chili as hometown folks have got their own best method.  To enhance the flavor of your Skyline, be sure to boil the ground beef and chill overnight.  It makes a difference.  For those of you who wanted to know where the beans and veggies were in this chili, you have come to the wrong chili site.  Now if someone from Cincy can give me a Goetta recipe, I would be ever grateful.I lost my great grandmother's recipes cards. ( it took 3 cards to get it all down)

My husband grew up in Ohio and has fond memories of skyline chili growing up and I wanted to prepare one of his childhood favorites.   I fully admit that my palette is not developed towards "midwestern cuisine" but this is just not good.  Smells okay but minimal bland flavor, no vegetables, zero texture.  Requires a stiff shot of tapatio to get it down.

I was making this when I realized there are no beans in it. I'm not familiar with Cincinnati chili so maybe I'm not the right critic for  this recipe. I've added white beans and kidney beans to make it more familiar to me. It's cooking at present and I'm sure it will be good, with the beans.

Thanks, Melissa! I'm from a northern suburb of Cincinnati and am a budding cook. I found your recipe very helpful in bringing a taste of home out to California. I went a little off script and could taste the difference, but it's quite authentic. I may repost with a crock pot version since it's also a very good way to go.

Within 24 hours we had Skyline Chili at their restaurant and the next day we decided to try this recipe..

THIS IS THE BEST!!!! 
CHANGES....Only used 1 1/2# ground beef and it was quite  lean so we went straight ahead with the recipe.  No waiting overnight.  Our  OHIO family members agreed.

Very good. Had Skyline chili many times in Cincinnati when in college. Almost perfect ... maybe a little sweeter. But delicious and pretty close.  Great on hot dogs and spaghetti with cheese and onions!!!

It was really good. I didn't skim the fat; I was more concerned with flavor than healthiness. I was also able to make it in one setting by skipping that process. The flavor was great, but after cooking so long it lost some  of its taste. I (liberally) added salt and allspice at the 2 hour mark and stopped cooking at 2 1/2 hours. I'm going to experiment with cooking times in the future, but all in all it was a great bowl of Cincinnati chili more comparable to Empress than Goldstar or Skyline in my opinion. Living in San Diego it was nice to be able to make it without relying on the family to send me packets, and the taste was slightly superior to the packets in my opinion.

I've lived in Cincinnati all my life, and across the street  from the Skyline Chili in Clifton for 12 years, so my nose for Skyline chili is pretty refined. This recipe has all the right ingredients but not in the right proportions, and is way too tame! I have another recipe which comes much closer. Follow this recipe but with the following changes: Add one can of tomato paste and another pint of water;  1/2 teaspoon of black pepper; 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (sub for the 2 T); 2 T paprika; 1 T cinnamon (not one tsp)l 2 T cumin (not 1 tsp). I don't usually add bay leaves or Worcestershire but they didn't ruin it. You can add kidney beans if you like, I do. Serve  over spaghetti with, onions, lots of shredded cheddar and oyster crackers. Mmmmm!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was just like being home again. The store-bought shredded cheese wouldn't do this recipe justice. For the most authentic experience, I set out bowls of oyster crackers and a bottle of hot sauce. We boiled some hot dogs and steamed the buns to add to the experience. 

I make the trip to Cincinnati about once a year and a trip to Skyline or Gold Star is one indulgence that I always look forward and toward. This recipe just brought me a little closer to home.

Made it for my Texan fiancé, he went back for seconds and told me it was REALLY good.  I like it with extra cocoa in it.  He likes it with powdered ghost pepper in it.

I made 1/2 the recipe and this was some amazing stuff!!  I will make a whole batch next time so I can freeze  for later.  I used Cocoa powder, ground allspice, ground cloves,  and ground bay leaf because that was what I had on hand and it turned out wonderful.  So good!!  Very glad I found this!  Thank you!

By itself, this is a little saltier than I prefer, but I didn't have a problem with that when eating on top of spaghetti. My husband was very pleased with this and wants me to make it again!

Excellent, to the ingredient base I add 4-5 whole cardamon seeds, tomato paste instead of sauce, cocoa, 8oz of V-8 juice, and double down on the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and Worcestershire sauce and then a final spin with handheld blender to refine the consistency of the ingredients.

This is the Crack of chili recipes! If you don't like Skyline you won't like it - it's something people love or hate. But if you love Skyline this is for you! I used half turkey and half beef because that's what I had. Served it over spaghetti squash (for wheat free - if you are not serving this over some type of spaghetti you are doing it wrong) with grated cheddar and sour cream - heaven!!

I've made it three times.   It's like skyline.  Perfect.   BUT,   hold salt until the very end of cooking.  The chili powder you use may have salt;  Worcestershire has salt; tomato sauce also could have of salt.   Add that to the 1 1/2 tsp salt of the recipe and you could have an insane amount of salt.  With the ingredients I use,  I find that only 1/2 tsp is about right.   I recommend you add salt and find the amount you like.

I admittedly have not had the authentic Skyline Chili in Cincinnati, but I made this tonight and it was delicious! I think this will also be a great meat sauce to add to chili fries, nachos, etc.

Unlike one reviewer stated, this isn't Skyline's recipe, how could it be? That's a closely guarded secret. But it's close. I used to make this recipe for years when I lived overseas, Jonesing for Skyline. The one big difference I would make here is that you have to break up the ground beef with your hands in cold water BEFORE boiling with spices. That's how you get a really fine texture that Skyline has. And I use more cumin. Also, no point in using lower fat ground beef if you're going to skim. But my Greek father-in-law would never skim anyway.  Here's a link to the recipe postcard I used...

I have tried for years to find out exactly what Skyline chili was putting in their delicious chili, and this poster has hit the nail on the head!  Don't leave anything out that op lists. Thanks so much for solving this mystery for me :)

The only thing I changed was one technique. Because Skyline is so finely ground, (the beef) I chose to cook it, then pulse a few times in food processor before returning to pot.  I did the same with the onion before cooking.
Because I grind my own lean meat instead of using ground beef, I was able to skip the skimming off fat step.

Great dish. An excellent alternative to plain chili or plain spaghetti.  I chose to colander the meat after it was cooked and rinsed it with the spray nozel. This got rid of the fat and ground it up better. Then right into the crock pot it went. Done in less than 4 hours. :)

Wonderful recipe...I used a teaspoon each of ground allspice and ground cloves because that's what I had on hand. I also thought it was done after simmering just an hour; three would have been too much. This is delicious and I look forward to making it often.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was I didn't cook the meat and refrigerate overnight. Instead I drained the fat after cooking the meet. I also didn't add water to the meat when cooking it. Instead I had about a quart to all the ingredients once I cooked the meet and transferred over to a bigger pot. Also make sure you keep stirring the chili because otherwise it will burn quick because of the chocolate in it.

I went the uber-lazy route and put all ingredients, plus 1 quart of water, in the crockpot, and cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  The flavor is good; however, not boiling off the water made the end result a bit watery.  No doubt, it'll be better if I simmer it, uncovered, on the stove for a bit to get rid of that excess water. Otherwise, I'd say its a solid recipe, and this is coming from someone who has been to Skyline Chili MANY times.

This was delicious and easy to make! I had a craving for this chili and made it on a whim.  For those who don't know, this isn't your typical chili, since there are no beans (unless you layer them in when you serve it). Not Texas or Wendy's style. I thought that boiling the meat was weird, but I did it and it worked out great.

I have used this recipe 3 times so far, and it is AMAZING. Like other people who have commented, I substitute 1 tsp of ground allspice for the 5 allspice berries. This results in a more consistent allspice flavor throughout. Also, I make sure to use white onions (instead of yellow or red). The smooth sweetness of white onions compliments this recipe perfectly. This Cincinnati chili recipe absolutely punishes the stuff made at H*rd T*mes. ;-)

I prepared this up with some left over turkey burgers in the freezer that we needed to get rid of. I thawed them out then started boiling it per the recipe. I added two beef bullion cubes to compensate for the lack of actual beef. Followed everything else and it was delicious! We like our food spicy, so I added more cayenne and chili powder. Served it up with kidney beans and jalapenos. No cheese ( I know) because we are watching the fat and are lactose intolerant, but it still turned out delicious! We had it with thin spaghetti noodles. Yum.  Don't forget to SALT SALT SALT the spaghetti noodles before boiling them. One other tip, I don't like having to search for whole cloves, bay leaf, and all spice so I stuck them into a coffee filter bag. Cut out a strip of the coffee filter from the top then used that as a string to tie the bag together. Works perfectly, cheap, and easy to get rid of the spices when I needed to.

Really love the ability to skim the fat in this recipe. No more weird orange fat that turns SOLID in the bowl while finishing up dinner!! And of course.. the Hubby loved it.

I found this recipe in Jeff Smiths 'The frugal Gourmet Cooks American' years ago, and have made it frequently. There is 5 ways to have this. Make the recipe, then to serve: 1. the meat and spiced chili 2. the chili comes on a pile of spaghetti. 3. spaghetti, chili and grated cheese. 4. add chopped yellow onions and 5. beans.! Enjoy it your favorite way!!

Very good version.  I've tried several different versions and even tried using bits and pieces of each to find just the right blend(tough to do).  This one works very well and can always be tweaked for your personal tastes.  For those who like the consistency a little finer (me), after you've boiled the meat, take a hand blender to the pot.  This makes it very fine! As a Cincinnati native living in Chicago, I'm always looking for a good fix. I grew up on this stuff! Cheers!

I'm a big fan of Real Chili in Milwaukee and this comes pretty close. I used hot, red chili from New Mexico, which made this spicy, spicy, spicy!
I skipped the refrigeration after cooking the meat, BUT I did think the chili was MUCH better the next day at lunch after refriging the entire pot overnight. In the future, I will probably allow that mellowing time if I plan to serve this to guests. The only thing I changed was using 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder instead of the baking chocolate, only because it's what I had on-hand. Pretty great recipe as is, and if you complain about cinnamon and chocolate being in your chili, then you shouldn't be looking at Cincinnati style chili recipes...that's what makes this unique!

Absolutely delicious. My entire family gobbled it down. I can't tell it apart from the original, even though I had to make a few modifications/substitutions.  I used 3 Tb. cocoa powder instead of the unsweetened chocolate because that's what I had on hand. I also had no whole cloves, bay leaves or whole allspice berries, so I substituted 1 tsp. of ground allspice.

I think that there is just a little too much chocolate in it and needs more cinnamon. And many a few too many onions (and I like onions). But it is a good recipe.

We've used this recipe for a few years now.  My hubby went to Louisville and ate at Skyline and this is just like it.  I don't refrigerate over night I just use 97% lean ground beef and it never seems to be too greasy.  I don't use whole allspice berries as I can't seem to find them so I use 1 1/2tsp powder and it tastes great.

I gave this 5 stars because it is authentic. However I am not a Cincinnatian by birth so I make a revised version for my family and I eat it. I still love this recipe though, couldn't bring myself to rate it any lower.

I made this last night for the first time and I didn't have cloves or allspice, but it didn't matter, it was amazing anyway!!  I also used ground turkey and didn't refrigerate it over night.  Still awesome!!

It was good but way too salty. So while it simmered and I taste-tested it, I ended up adding sugar, way more cinnamon, a bit more powdered clove, and some nutmeg. My recommendation is to go to a restaurant that knows how to make Cincinnati chili, then you can take a recipe like this and tweak it to your taste.

Very good and different flavored chili than I am use to. I cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp. and added chopped rehydrated ancho chiles to the mix. Works great in the crock pot, just reduced the water to 2 1/2 cups. 

 Left overs make a great tamale, or shepherd’s pie base for a spice change.

My husband and I thought this was to die for. We have had it over spaghetti and over hot dogs. It makes a lot and freezes well.
