I wrote this recipe...Use a 11" X 7" Pan. It will NOT come out right with a bread pan. Sorry for the confusion.

I thought this was one of the best lemon bar recipes I've tried.  I loved the crust!  I only needed to cook the lemon part for 20 minutes instead of 25.  These were GREAT!!!!

Many of the four or five star ratings for this recipe are only after the reviewer made significant changes. A perfect recipe should be spot on accurate and not need doctoring with amounts of ingredients, the ingredients themselves, pan sizes or baking times. While I agree with a lot of the changes made, they are no longer reviewing THIS recipe.  As this recipe stands it is, first,  too short on filling for this size pan. Most lemon bar recipes, however, do call for a two egg filling for an 8x8 pan, or a four egg filling for a 9x13 pan. This recipe also calls for powdered sugar in the filling, which I've never seen. I don't think it would be enough given the amount of lemon juice called for. So as written, I believe this recipe has some problems and only merits three stars. I made this in a 9x9 pan, although an 11x7 is fine too.  I made the crust as written but made a couple of changes on the filling.  I made 1-1/2 times the filling recipe and used regular, granulated sugar instead of the confectioners' sugar called for.  I baked the crust 15 minutes at 350 degrees, and then another 15-20 minutes once the filling was added.  The tartness and sweetness were just right and there was a better balance of crust to filling. I did observe, however, that I much prefer lemon bar recipes that call for a little flour in the filling as opposed to baking powder.  All and all, a nice altered version of this recipe, but I'd much prefer a recipe that required no revision.

I'm normally not a fan of lemon bars, but these were really good! My mother said this was one of the best desserts she'd ever eaten. The filling had just the right amount of "chewy gooey-ness". It tastes like it has sweetened condensed milk in it, and I was really surprised to learn that it didn't. I'll definitely be making these again!

I couldn't decide between making this recipe or "The Best Lemon Bars" so I made both yesterday.  Friends and family adored and gobbled up "The Best Lemon Bars" and this batch went virtually untouched.

Light flaky shortbread type crust bottom.  It perfectly balances the tart flavor of the lemon filling on top!  It was awesome!

Really tasty! I doubled the recipe thinking I would make two batches, but ended up using all most of the crust and all of the filling for one. Next time I will probably only double the filling and put it in a 11x9 pan. It needs a little more confectioner's sugar as it was a little to tart for me!!

This recipe is a great standard.  For all the people who have been critical, I find it unwarranted.  Obviously, the  pan suggested will produce a thin bar (as pictured). A smaller pan will yield thicker bars.  It is absolutely perfect for coffee/tea as the recipe states--if you want a dessert, make them thicker and therefor more substantial.    I find it unfair to rate this recipe poorly, it is very good, and the results turn out exactly like the photo and as stated in the author's description.  Excellent recipe that turns out exactly as described by the author!

This is my favorite lemon bar recipe. All the other recipes pale compared to this one. Even though I've been baking for about 25 years, I've never heard of an 11x7 inch pan, so I whipped out my bad  fourth grade math skills to resize the recipe for your standard 9x13 inch pan. Preheat to 325. Cut 3/4 cup of butter into your 9x13 and stick it in the oven for a minute or two to soften it and grease the pan at the same time automatically. Then add 1 3/4 c flour and 1/2 c sugar directly into the pan. Stir. Use one of the leftover butter papers to pat it down. Bake for 18 minutes. Meanwhile, beat 3 eggs gently. Stir in 1 3/4 c sugar. Take your prettiest lemon and for God's sake use a real zester. Don't bother trying to get a grater to do the job of a zester. And don't bother measuring the zest. Just use a big lemon's worth of zest and it will taste good. Then cut the lemon in half, and holding the cut end up so that the seeds don't fall in, gouge out the juice. I use a wooden thing. Repeat with the other half. Like the author says, wait until you're ready to pour the filling over the crust before adding 1/3 teaspoon of the baking powder. I know you don't have a 1/3 teaspoon. You just have to guess. Call it a scant 1/2 teaspoon if it makes it easier. Mix. Pour. Bake it for 20 minutes. And despite the temptation to immediately eat all of the lemon bars, do yourself a favor and wait until tomorrow. It will taste about 500 times better tomorrow.

Tasty and very easy to make.  I added a little extra lemon juice to make them really lemony.

for lemon bars they were very good. I did double the filling for the bars so they were a little more substantial.

Pretty good flavor but not enough lemon.  One reviewer mentioned that they doubled the lemon topping, which is NECESSARY for this recipe.  Rather than making this again, I would probably be inclined to find another recipe.

Just baked this today. Changed the recipe a bit by making more crust and making it thicker also. (The crust tastes and smells fantastic by the way). Also messed around with the powdered sugar/lemon juice ratio and baked for about 15 mins at 350. They came out looking very nice. Will let you know how my mom likes them, she is the one I made em for.

These tasted good, but there was like no filling. They did not fluff up at all and they looked horrible. I liked the taste, but it was paper thin, and I used a small pan.

I thought the flavor was perfect! The crust has a ligh crunch to it. The lemon filling has the right balance of sweet and sour. I baked the bars in a 9x13 and doubled the crust ingredients and doubled the filling ingredients. I am going to bake these in 8x8 silicone pans next time.

Beautiful lemon flavor!  I would definately prefer them over the kind in a box.  They are a lot more work than the box lemon bars, but very worth it!!

Like alot of you out there, I also doubled the filling.  But needing more filling was irrelevant considering the fact that this recipe is too sour to enjoy.  Lemon Bars are my moms fave, so I tried this recipe for her, but she did not care for them.  I'm going back to my tried and true Lemon Bar recipe which has the perfect blend of sweet and sour.

I absolutely love this recipe. I make it all the time, and eat at least half of it myself. I always double the filling, but other than that follow it exactly. So good!

I did have to double the recipe for a 9x13, but other than that, it came out wonderful. The consistency was perfect and the bars had just the right amount of tartness. My husband and kids loved them!

Made many lemon bars but this one is very good with the confectioners sugar - it does not need flour which we likedl.    Used a slightly smaller pan that way there is a thicker layer of filling.;  Please leave this recipe as it because it is written exactly the way the contributor wanted it to be made.

As my spouse said upon eating one, "You couldn't ask for more from a lemon bar." Delicious and generally perfect! Tweaks: I used a 9x9 pan, which was the perfect size for this recipe, and I baked the lemon part only 20 minutes.

These bars were really good.  I did double the crust and the filling to make the pan full because I have a big family.  They only lasted for two meals anyway.

I agree with other reviewers--this recipe did not work for me following the way it is written, but with tweaks it would be good. The crust was really tasty, but the filling was not...there wasn't enough and it became hard, chewy and sticky.

I made these in a 6x2 round pan for thicker lemon filling and added more powdered sugar and lemon juice-the recipe is very good, the crust is delicate and like the author states, great for tea. If you want thicker bars, stop complaining and just double the recipe. I mean, its so simple you can tweak it anyway and still get a good result.

Do not make these.  It was all crust with no lemon.  I even doubled the lemon and it still was not enough.  Follow the recipe on this website for "Best Lemon Bars."

I've never made lemon bars before but they're one of my favourite desserts. The first time I made these they were delicious but too thin (I had used a 9x13" pan). But the second time I used a square pan. Instantly doubled the thickness. I also doubled the lemon juice (and added a touch extra lemon zest) for a more tart bar. Wonderful recipe for first timers! :)

I followed previous advice to use this recipe for the crust and the "Lemon Square Bars" recipe for the filling. The crust is delightful.  I used whole wheat pastry flour.

Made these last week and they were eaten up pretty quickly. These are only the second lemon bars I've had in my life and I'm not super fond of lemon, so take my rating lightly. =3 I did like them though, but I would prefer a gooier topping.

These are the best lemon bars I have ever served. My family has never been a fan of lemon flavor, especilly in bar form but they ask for these treats constantly. A big hit at my house and worth a try by all who read these reviews.

I was lkioooking for a lemon bar recipe & came upon this so thought ok, I'll try this......I an't really say this was one of my better baking experiences.  The crust I found was terribly hard to spread out in a smaller pan other than the 11X7 that was originally mentioned. I followed the recipe exact exxcept for doubling the lemon topping to make sure there would be enough filling.  Results..unflaky crust..extremely very very thin bar,  & hardly enuf to call desert..I  can usually give the recipes a pretty good raiting but sorry not this time around.  Thank you for your time.

This mama was NOT happy. I made a single batch of the crust and a double batch of the filling, as several reviews stated. When I poured the filling over the hot crust, it looked thin but I had faith. I baked them up and was SADLY disappointed. Very thin, hardly ANYTHING there. I used a 9x13 pan, which is why I doubled the filling, and 2x the filling MIGHT have worked in an 8x8 pan. The flavor was there... but definitely double the recipe, half the crust and use the smallest pan you have!

I did everything right - except my pan was 9 x 11.  There wasn't even close to enough filling.  I sure wish I'd doubled the filling portion.  I may try again and double the filling.  Too bad. I was making them for a special party tonight...

Outstanding bars. I loved the lemon and had a bundle from my meyer lemon tree. I am making a double, double batch for a bake sale for work. I pre-tested these with 8 people who loved them. I double the recipe & used a 13x9 pan.

I love this recipe. I did take another reviewer's advice and add extra lemon zest and lemon juice, I about doubled what the recipe called for since I like my lemon bars extra lemon-y, and they turned out great! Also I doubled the entire recipe in order to use an 11x17 pan like it calls for - I tried to make the dough stretch enough to fill the bottom but finally I gave in and decided to double the recipe - I'm glad I did because I'm afraid the lemon bars would have been way too thin otherwise. Anyways, I brought them to work and everyone loved them - one guy took a couple home to his wife, and a couple of people asked me for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper!

I only used this recipe for the crust, which was scrumptious... very much like shortbread.  I used the "Lemon Square Bars" recipe for the topping.

Yummy! Love the shortbread crust. The filling didn't seem to be enough to make a thick, traditional gooey filling, but its a nice cookie anyway, a little  different. I used a pan that was 11 1/2 x 7 1/2. I thought maybe it stretched out an extra inch, therefore spreading thinner, crust and filling. I would only increase the filling by half if at all.

Nice lemon flavor, but definitely no more than 18 mins in the oven with the lemon layer. 20 was too long. I would also like to see more lemon layer, perhaps doubling the ingredients for the lemon layer?

Very delicious and the crust was JUST PERFECT.  The only thing was that the lemony part was very gooey and I could never get it to not look "sweaty" and when sprinkled with powdered sugar, the tops turned clear and not white like in the picture because they were so gooey.  But they were just absolutely delicious.

I used a 9"x9" pan AND doubled the filling - otherwise these bars would have been paper thin.  They're a little tart for my taste, but my husband likes them that way so I guess that's just a personal preference thing.  I will likely use this recipe again.

It was ok. I liked the lemon flavour, but I did have to double the recipe for the size of pan stated. Otherwise it would have been very very thin.

I love this recipe! It's quick, easy, and the bars are so tender and yummy! I have already made these twice, and will make again many more times. Be sure to double up on both the crust and the filling for a thicker bar!

These were disastrous the first time around when I followed the recipe. Although the crust made a good impression on me so I redid them again today with a few modifications to it. Like all the other reviewers mentioned, it may be best to double at least the filling if not the entire recipe for the size pan it calls for. I only doubled the filling but next time I will try doubling the entire recipe. It turned out yummy and I was very much pleased with the result!

Delish! I like my lemon bars a little thicker, so I used a 9 x 9 brownie pan instead of the 9 x 13.  I think they turned out great!  Will make again.

These lemon bars are delish.  I had two small problems with the recipe as it's written. First, after mixing the filling, I decided to double it as other reviewers suggested.  I also used a 8x8" square pan instead of the 11x7".  There was barely enough crust to cover the bottom of my pan so I have no idea how you are supposed to cover the 11x7 w/o doubling the crust recipe, too.  The upside is they are good and were a hit with my entire family...even my 2yo.

Yummy! The shortbread crust was just what I was looking for and the balance of sweet and tart is just right. I did do as previously suggested and doubled the filling and increased the baking time by 5 - 10 minutes.

In general I don't care for lemon bars because they're too sweet.  These bars are the other extreme -- too tart.  I gave 3 stars because the other folks raved over them.

Ok. Guess I messed this one up. To me, the bars tasted like a big pile of flour...maybe I didn't back the first part long enough (It was browned, though). I also thought it needed more "goo" aka lemon mixture. Very disappointed.

This was good, but not great.  Some reviewers said too lemony, some said not enough, so I made it as-is.  It was not terribly lemony, I would like it more lemony, but that's my taste.  Also, some reviewers said there wasn't enough lemon topping - I agree.  I would double that next time.  But they were good and everyone I shared them with liked them, I had just hoped for something a little more tart and with at least as much lemon stuff on top as crust.

After reading the reviews that said that crust and/or filling should be doubled, I actually made the recipe as suggested, but put it in a 9x9 pan. Worked out fine, though I'll definitely double the filling next time for more gooey lemon. FYI, it is a very custardy looking bar, but tastes great.

I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the lemon top and found the crust's taste to be bland and lost in the filling.  The lemon was more gel-like rather than creamy like I was looking for.  It did have good lemony flavor though.  I probably will look for another recipe.

my first time making lemon bars from scratch and the family loved them.  they were a little thinner and crisper than I remember eating as a kid, but we ate half the batch in one sitting, so I can't complain.  Next time I think I will double or at least 1 1/2 the amount of lemon filling, but it was a hit regardless!

This was  recipe and it was pretty easy with few ingredients. I liked the crust it was crumbly and delicious. I would have baked it maybe 20 mins rather than 25 however. I did have to double the filling because I had to use a 9x11" pan but it was ok. I think it was just a tad too lemony and I would have taken about 1/4 of the lemon zest out. Otherwise it was good.

I lost my old recipe for lemon bars and thought I'd try these. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the crust was tasteless and crumbly and the lemon part was very bland. Probably wouldn't make these again

Made these on a whim for Mothers Day.. my parents thought they were pretty good; which means they were very good. If they say not bad in means they're good. (: Yes, they are funny like that. 
The next evening I took them to my Bible study group and they went over like gangbusters. So I'm making them again with a gluten free flour and will report back. Very easy in addition to being good, a little piece goes a long way.

I did not care for this. I didnt taste any lemon plus they were very dry. But i dont claim to be the best cook. Wish they would have turned out better

You could definitely use a 8x8 pan instead of a 11x7 if you like them a little thicker. After 20min, the edges start to burn. I added a little lime juice and zest to change things up!

The crust is a very good shortbread but mine got too brown and hard on the edges even though I reduced the baking time to 20 min. without and 20 min. with filling.  The filling seemed sparse in such a large pan, but even a thin layer was very intense and tasty.  I used a home grown tree ripened lemon-great taste.  I will make this again in a slightly smaller pan with shorter baking times.
