Very good basic salad.  I used a little less mayo than was indicated and used pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had on hand.  I also chopped up one and a half red delicious apples and tossed them in a little lemon juice to keep them from browning and added those to the salad.  It gives the salad a great crunch and some more substance.

I loved it!  I made it twice.  The second time I added half the amount of mayo and sour cream and my family liked it even better.

This salad is excellent!  Love the walnuts and coconut in it!  Will try next time with fat-free mayo and sour cream to decrease the fat content but will definitely make again.

This was Fabulous!!! I didn't have any walnuts so I substituted pecans, and it was still great! There wasn't but a tiny bit left after I took it to a Cub Scout Banquet! Terrific flavors. And the coconut was an added bonus. definitely a make again salad!

It is the Carrot Salad that my Aunt Alice made. She would make it on a handheld grater as electic shredders were not made yet, for special dinners like Easter, Thanksgiving and dinner parties that my parents would have.  I mayself made for family dinners.  The only thing that was different was there was no suger used as my dad was a diabetic(sp)and she and I used mayo or the salad dressing that many use for mayo instead of creamy salad dressing and nothing was mesured (sp). I will be making this for my family very soon.

This was great for finding a new way to introduce carrots to my 2 year old.  We absolutely loved the flavors.  The only change we made is substituting Splenda instead of sugar. Definitely will make again.  Wonderful summer dish to keep the heat out of the kitchen!

YUM.   My boyfriend and his son are definitely "meat and potatoes" types.   So it's
satisfying to see them gobble up veggies! 

I did not have raisins, so I used dried cranberries.  Cut the mayo in half and added the zest and juice of half a lemon.  Next time I think I will plump the cranberries in the lemon juice and /or vinegar in the microwave for a few seconds.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I can't wait for the next pot-luck so I can bring this salad.

This was a nice change of pace from our usual salads.  This was very tasty and I’m glad I used less mayonnaise than the recipe requested.  We enjoyed it very much.

I made this as part of my Thanksgiving menu, and it was absolutely yummy!  I love carrot raisin salad, and this is the way it should taste.  I doubled the recipe because I knew it would get gobbled up.  At first I was a bit concerned about the amount of vinegar, because when I sampled it right after mixing everything together, the vinegar seemed a bit overpowering, so I added an extra teaspoon of sugar to balance it out.  However, after allowing it to refrigerate for a day, it tasted perfect.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

This was SO yummy! The combination of flavors and textures is fantastic. The clever addition of shredded coconut, celery, and nuts is different, but oh-so-good! Definitely puts 'traditional' Carrot Raisin Salad to shame. Thank you for a great recipe that was a hit with the whole family AND with company. Will make again!

Everyone enjoyed....different and yummy.  Used fat free plain yogurt, low fat made w/ olive oil mayo, and reduced fat for cream for the dressing.  I liked the coconut and raisins in this and the crunch of the walnuts.  Will make again.  Thanks !

Great salad. Very easy. I mix the veggies and dressing separately ahead of time and combine when needed. My husband was surprised by the coconut. I did not add nuts.

I love Carrot Raisin Salad, and this is a fabulous recipe!  However, I changed it up a little since I don't like mayo.  I made a dressing out of 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 3 tbsp orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  It worked just as well and tasted great.

My family ate it, but I will try a different recipe next time.  The coconut was a novelty but it didn't make the salad fantastic or anything.  I made the salad exactly as the recipe said and there was too much mayonnaise and sour cream.

I love the coconut in this recipe! My daughter has always made a similar one. She and  I prefer pecans so I used them instead of walnuts.  I didn't have any celery on hand so I just used celery seed.  I rarely have sour cream on hand so I just used 1 part miracle whip and 2 parts mayonaise and it turned out scrumptious. I am going to get all the ingredients and make this again 'by the recipe' just to see if it's any better.  I don't know if it can be any better! Thanks Karena for this one.

VERY GOOD but a word to the wise:  Only chill a few hours as directed in the recipe!  I made the mistake of preparing it the day before and chilling overnight.  BIG MISTAKE.  The flavors blended too much, the dish became bland and the color turned to an unappealing yellow.  Definitely best made and served freshed.  Still a great recipe and I will make again!

The mayo and sour cream are a bit heavy (although easy to adjust to taste), but the addition of coconut is great!  I grated some fresh ginger into mine for a little extra tang.

Easy to make & delicious is a good combination.  The shredded coconut makes a superb addition.  I used what I had & substituted it w/peanuts (walnuts), dried cranberries (raisins) & left out the sour cream.  I'm sure the exact recipe is even better.

I have never had carrot salad before so I decided to try and make it because it looked appetizing from the picture. My bf and I loved it!! However I added more cocunut and next time I would skip the celery and add apples instead.

I found that all the dairy in it made it a little too heavy.

This hit the spot for a side dish with our BBQ!..  I had to make a few substitutions due to what I had on hand.  I used pecans in place of the walnuts and brown sugar, which I didn't measure, but was probably a couple tsp...  I added a little extra shredded coconut too, but I think that's what makes this dish a 5 star! Tastes best when really cold!

Awesome! I changed it a bit per our tastes-- used slivered almonds, skipped the coconut, and used a mix of mayo and slaw dressing in place of sour cream. Added a couple of sliced apples, and voila! Crisp, fresh, tangy, and light, perfect for a summer salad or side dish. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This salad is truly very nice.  I omit the raisins and walnuts, and add diced red or green apples and pineapple bits. I've used only white vinegar as I have not had cider vinegar.  Lovely.

GREAT recipe!  I doubled it, using fresh carrots from the local farm market. I used 1/2 cup fat free mayo and 1/2 cup low fat mayo, and also used fat free sour cream.  I've never made carrot raisin salad before, so I was very happy when it came out so good!  I love the addition of walnuts and coconut -- yum!!  I noticed several reviewers also added apples, that sounds great, too!

We make this at work a lot and always have people ask us for the recipe.  The only thing we do differently is we always use toasted walnuts and if we've got toasted coconut to use up, we use that, but using untoasted coconut is just as good.

I really liked this recipe. I only used about 1/3 c. mayo and used a tad more sour cream. It was great. Unique taste. My husband liked the addition of the coconut. I only let it marinate for an hour and it was still great.

Delicious salad! Sadly, we didn't have any coconut on hand, but the salad carries itself with all the other ingredients. We will definitely eat this again! :)

I've been craving carrots lately, so I used my Pampered Chef chopper and chopped up some baby carrots I had on hand, added raisins and sunflower nuts (1/2 cup) and then used your dressing recipe. Delicious! Can't wait to try again with coconut; I normally have it in my pantry but no luck today :(

I made this as a side dish for the adults at my son's 8th birthday party and the grown ups who actually tried it raved about it.  I give it a four because not many people cared to try it.  I myself found it delicious and would definately make it again for myself and my family but not for gatherings.  Maybe I will play a little with the presentation to create more appeal.

I liked it better than straight mayo based carrot salad, but it was still bland.

Delicious, crunchy,  sweet , & refreshing slaw type salad. My family liked it too. I grated 1 apple  in mine since I didn’t have enough shredded carrots. It was very good.

Great recipe.....much better than the regular carrot raisin salad.  Then again anything with coconut in it, is always great!!
