Best ever slow cooker chicken. It's moist and super flavorful.  Variation I made: did not add the vegetables. I slid the butter under the skin per recipe, laid it in the bottom of a big oblong slow cooker. Whisked the soy sauce, 2 T  Real lemon (didn't have a fresh lemon), 1 T. dried minced onion (prefer the less intense onion flavor), salt & pepper and poured it over the chicken. Then laid slin slices of the cream cheese over the chicken, sprinkled with 1 T. dried parsley (didn't have fresh), 1/2 t. dried chives, 1/4. t. dried basil.  Cooked on high for 5-6 hours. Removed chicken (with cheese on top) & kept warm in oven.  Skimmed fat off sauce & thickened with a little corn starch & served on the side.  Absolutely to die for!  When then cream cheese ran out, you could dip in the sauce...moist without either...but the flavor!  It's so tender, all the meat falls off so watch the small bones!

This was soooo good, and EASY.  I did add a little cream of chicken soup and  a cup or so of water to have more "gravy".  It was FANTASTIC.

Wow, excellent recipe!  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and omitted the buter.  Sauce was absolutely delicious!

Love this recipe!!  My husband says its his favorite chicken recipe.  The first time I made it, I used the chicken breasts and I didn't have potatoes, so I left them out and we had it with rice and we thought it was outstanding!!  I made it again yesterday and used chicken thighs with small baby potatoes and I added a couple of carrots chopped up.  I used the zest and juice from the lemon and omitted the salt because of the lemon juice and soy sauce.  A complete meal in one pot!!  Very rich, but very, very good!!  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I pretty much like it, but it needs some tweaking, imo. I use only 1/4 c butter and remove the skin from the chicken. It tends to be greasy if you don't. I cut the potatoes bit-sized, just cus that's how I like them. I add 3 cloves of garlic. I also use a whole 8oz box of sliced mushrooms. I like extra gravy too, so I add a cup of homemade chicken broth. I also zest the lemon before I juice it. If using soy sauce, omit salt. I have used liquid aminos as a healthier alternative to soy sauce, but if I do I use the salt the recipe calls for. Adding cream soup is not necessary and adds much extra sodium; not a healthful idea with the sodium content in the soy sauce.  I have made this recipe a few times and with these changes it is a family favorite. With these changes, I would give the recipe FIVE stars!!

The chicken just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. This savory dish may be a little too salty so reduce the soy sauce and the salt. Also keep about a fourth of the parsley and add it in the last 10 minutes to truly enhance the flavors. Truly a wonderful mixture. The sauce was creamy and delicious. My entire family loved it. Will keep playing with it and keep you all posted.

I thought this was a terrific chicken/crockpot recipe! I used boneless chicken breasts, so I left out the butter. I didn't have the small red potatoes, so I just quartered the baking potatoes that I already had. I used the 1/3 fat cream cheese and since I didn't have an actual lemon, I added about a Tbsp of lemon juice instead. I took the advice of other reviewers and used half the soy sauce. I had to leave out the onion as my kids won't touch them, but I used some onion powder instead. Also, since I didn't have fresh mushrooms, I used a can of drained mushrooms. I was a little concerned at first because the cheese mix was thick. I dolluped (sp?) the cheese over the top and smeared it as best as I could. Then, about halfway through, I stirred it all together and it looked much more sauce-like. I cooked it on high for about 4 hrs. Delicious!

My husband loved this. The kids and I hated it.  I did choke it down so that the kids would try it.  Since the rule is you have to try it before you can say you don't like it... well I didn't like it at all.

Taste was okay, but even after 8 hours cooking the cream cheese didn't melt. When I stirred the dish, the cheese mixed in with the sauce and had a curdled appearance as noted by other reviewers. The potatoes fell apart and became part of the sauce. I really wanted it to be good - its hard to find a creamy chicken slow cooker recipe that doesn't use condensed soup - but its not good enough to makle again for us. It really needs to be a better presentation to make it again - we won't.

Wasn't crazy about this recipe. The flavor was ok but the cream cheese didn't melt smoothly and made it look grainy like curdled milk.

This was awesome!! My 1 year old doesn't eat ANYTHING, and she scarfed it! I was out of muschrooms, and used bone-in thighs and drumsticks. I cooked it on High and it was falling off the bone in just over 3 hours. Highly recommend this!

absolutely delish! the chicken was super tender and oh so yummy! i used boneless skinless chicken breasts and left out the butter. other reviews said it was too salty, so i used half the soy sauce and left out the salt. i didn't have red potatoes, but used baking potatoes, and they worked just as well. the potatoes seemed to soak up all the soy sauce because that was the saltiest part of the whole dish. but all in all, it was still amazing. leaving off one star because of the saltyness and there didn't seem to be enough "gravy".

No butter, skinless, boneless chicken breasts, a few carrots and more mushrooms.  Red potatoes were the size of the mushrooms so didn't cut them in half.  No salt and even though I didn't quite use 1/2 c. of soy sauce it was still pretty salty.  But interesting and different, poured the gravy over microwaved broc/cauli mix.   Will adjust the soy sauce next time.  And maybe add a garlic clove or two.

My wife makes this regularly now and I love it! The meat just falls off of the bone and is amazing... since the meat falls off of the bone so easily, I would suggest using a cut with large bones in it, otherwise you may get a mouth full of small bones that you didn't know where there... AMAZING DISH!

This was really good.  It ended up turning out like a stew, as the chicken and potatoes fell apart after cooking for 8 hours.  I ended up serving  the left overs over rice and that was just wonderful!  I will be making this again!

Way too salty, maybe better with low sodium soy sauce?  It came out looking like an unappetizing creamy brown mush.  Though I have to say, the taste was decent, aside from the saltiness.  My boyfriend liked it as well.  I don't think I would make it again, but I wouldn't totally discourage others from trying it.

I can't review yet, it's in the slow cooker as we speak-I'm a little nervous- smells good, does not look good at all, cream cheese has cottage cheese look to it (thought it would melt) and after reading reviews, am a little worried about the saltiness from the soy sauce even tho I cut it back and did not use any additional salt-I am a pepper lover:) I guess we will see.....

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SOY SAUCE! This recipe holds a lot of promise - the cream cheese, potatoes, parsley and chicken combo is great BUT we added the 1/2 cup of soy sauce and it ended up tasting a lot like salty soy sauce. We also just used frozen chicken breasts and ommitted the butter. The chicken and potatoes turned out fine but I would try this again using maybe a tablespoon soy sauce and then just chicken broth and some white wine.

I really wanted this to be good, but it was just ok.  Used boneless chicken breast and didn't cut up the potatoes due to reviews of being too soft.  Potatoes were still soft, but that's what you get from the crock pot.  Also omitted the salt since many said too salty-the soy sauce was the right amount of salt.  My husband said the chicken was ok but the potatoes were very bland.  Not sure if will attempt again.

The chicken was dry and tough, and the vegetables were soft, untasty and unappealing.

This came out so juicy and flavorful.  Loved it. Used 2 large chicken breast.   I left out the mushrooms. Added some frozen peas about an hour before it was done.  Cooked on high 4 1/2 hours.  Although the cream cheese didn't melt as much as you would think, the flavor was there.  I removed the bones and skin before slicing the chicken anyway.  Small  golden potatoes were perfect, not too soft at all. Next time instead of putting the cheese on top of the chicken,  I will put it in the bottom with the liquids.

Utterly DELICIOUS. This dish is creamy and rich. It tastes so so so good. I wouldn't call it low-cal, but it doesn't have any sugars or grains, so it should be easy enough to maintain your weight if you control your menu.

The ingredients are so amazing. The chicken is good. The cream cheese makes it better. And the mushrooms push this from a nine to an eleven.

Amazing! I only did a couple of things differently- I browned the boneless skinless chicken in butter before putting it in the crockpot and I also added some chicken broth. The chicken was falling apart! My husband and guest loved it! I highly recommend it.

This was a great recipe. Family loved it. Must be fool proof, if I couldn't mess it up. Used boneless breasts. Cooked in a crock pot for less than the suggested time....ready in 6 hours (on high). Preparing it again this weekend by popular request. I am going to substitute dill for the parsley and see how that works.

I didn't give 5 stars because I made a few changes, but the results were delicious! I only used a tablespoon of soy sauce and left out the salt and butter. I also added a cup of chicken broth to thin the sauce. Loved it!

A great hearty dinner.  Though, it didn't look that appetizing.  The color of the sauce was a little off due to the cream cheese and soy sauce combination.  But it did taste great.  And it was a super easy recipe.  Love recipes where you just dump everything into the slow cooker.  Will definitely pass this recipe on to friends.

The flavors in this dish are really odd.  I am NOT picky at all, but I did not care for this recipe.  Not sure what I did wrong.  It was weird.

Admittedly tasty, but so greasy and salty.  If I make it again, I will eliminate half, or all of the butter, and the salt. Also, the lemon and cream cheese, while tasty, made for an unattractive curdled look.  I may "doctor" and try one more time.

It just didn't taste good.  I expected the cream cheese to melt and be really creamy and it wasn't.  I added only mushrooms as the vegetable.  I agree it was tooooo salty!!!

Much too salty, even using low-salt soy sauce. Plus, after 8 hours, the potatoes turned to mush as did most of the entire dish. Sorry, but an interesting mix did not work in this instance.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was FABULOUS!  I halved the recipe to make enough for two and it cooked in 7 hours.  I added a little extra water and then had to add a little dissolved cornstarch to thicken it up.  Yummy!
