This was pretty good. The panko breadcrumbs gave it a nice crunch, and the sauce was nice and spicy.  We didn't mix the sauce in with the chicken. Instead, we poured it over the chicken and rice. I think in the future I would cut back on the rice vinegar by about 2 Tbs.  (The vinegar flavor was a little too intense.) I'd also either cut back on the cornstarch or add more water, as it got a little too thick. After a few minor adjustments, this would be a great recipe!

We LOVED this recipe. We eat Asian quite often but this was my first attempt cooking it(other then stirfry) Used this recipe because it was crispy we were not disappointed, easy to follow urned out great. The ingredients were easier to find then i expected as well. The sauce does have an intense vinegar flavor otherwise i would have given it five stars. Also when i made it we were out of corn starch i subed flour and cut back a little since people said it was to thick my consistency was right on! I also took the spiciness up a notch extra chile paste and red peperfakes..we like it HOT! Next time gonna reduce vinegar and use the crispy chicken section with the sauce from the other kung pao recipe for fun. But this is good...worth trying!

Great recipe. I make this recipe WAY easier but omitting steps 1-3 and using pre-packaged breaded popcorn chicken and cooking it in the oven before frying. Believe me, it tastes wonderful! Also, next time I will add more ginger, red pepper flakes, and garlic to the sauce because it wasn't quite flavorful enough for me. But still, great recipe!

I really ended up with a five stars dish after my modifications: I boiled my chicken and then chopped it up, threw it in the oil to brown along with sliced carrot and celery.   I added the ginger and garlic after the meat had browned and veggies were to my liking as not to allow them to burn up.  I cut the vinegar down to 2T but added some of chicken water (1/3 cup)along with the rest of the ingredients to make this more saucy; we served over white rice.  The combination of the sweet, tangy and spicy made this awesome!  I will continue to make this recipe this way! :)

This was okay but I guess I was expecting more. I took the advice of others and cut the vinegar down to 3 T. I didn't have rice vinegar so used white vinegar. I was hoping it would be a pretty reddish sauce but was dark brown, I suppose that's to be expected with the soy sauce. I also cut down the soy sauce so it wouldn't be too salty. My husband like it but doubt I'll make it again.l

I've never used panko before, and now, I am a fan.  Enjoyed the flavors and the texture of it.

A tablespoon of cornstarch thickened the sauce a little too much for us. Maybe the author meant a teaspoon of cornstarch? Either way it wasn't much of a hit, but it wasn't terrible either.

This was a good recipe but I agree with the previous reviews that less vinegar is necessary than called for.  We had it with ramen noodles and threw in some peas and carrots,  will make again!

Good flavor for me, but way too spicy for the kids, and I still cut down the amount of pepper in my try at it.  Love the panko, the sauce smelled so good!

The food had a very good taste, it was rich in flavor and also very nutritive. I didn't use chicken tenders but chicken breast and it worked great even this way! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Absolutely great, I had to replace the peanuts with cashews due to allergies. Young kids asked me to start cooking all the chicken this way! All Smiles!

Absolutely THE BEST Chinese food I've ever had!!!!! I have had some of the best kung pao chicken and this tops them all! However, to me, it did not taste like kung pao. ..it was even better! I made some changes. ....apple cider vinegar instead of rice or white vinegar. In addition, I used some Italian bread crumbs  (it was all I had) and added a little more brown sugar and soy. TIP: season raw chicken with garlic & onion powder. .......a splash of sesame seed oil too!  ENJOY!

Made this dish according to the recipe but would definitely make some adjustments. Cut the rice vinegar in 1/2 as it was very over powering. My husband suggested cutting the brown sugar in 1/2 as well but I was ok with that part. Also added some green peppers and fresh mushrooms.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  It was rather bland and disappointing.  After reading the reviews, I cut the rice vinegar down to 2 Tbsp and the cornstarch to 1 tsp (which was a good amount).  I used slightly more ginger, green onion, and garlic than it called for, but it was still bland.  The panko fried chicken was good (it always is!), but after dumping it into the sauce, even that lost a lot of its appeal.  If I were to make it again (which I won't), I would probably add more brown sugar and would just pour the sauce over the top of the chicken at the table instead of combining them in the pan.

I thought this recipe was good however the sauce was way too thick. I would make again but make some adjustments in the amount of cornstarch used. I also agree with the other reviews in using less vinegar.

This recipe was great. I halved the vinegar and I thought it was great. I am a vinegar fan, though. 6 tbs. would definitely kill the dish. I loved the vinegar smell wafting as it cooked. I used red chili paste and a splash of chili oil as well. It was the best version of Kung Pao I've been able to find, but I only rated it a 4 because I am measuring it against my favorite version at a local restaurant. The corn starch it called for was the perfect amount. The only thin I would do different next time is throw the chicken in the sauce and toss to coat. It was hard to get the chicken coated well after pouring the sauce over it. Overall, great dish and pretty darn easy.

This was the one of the saltiest dishes I have ever made, we could only eat 2 or 3 pieces of the chicken.  We were extremely excited about this recipe and was very disappointed by the results.

Whoa this is spicy, but I like it.  I oven fried my chicken instead of using oil.  I also decreased the cornstarch  to 1/2 tblsp since 1 tblsp seemed like too much.  I think what I used was STILL too much so I will decrease next time.  Yes, there will be a next time, but with some changes; decrease the cornstarch even more and maybe decrease the red pepper flakes (I like the original amount but not everyone likes stuff that spicy like me).
