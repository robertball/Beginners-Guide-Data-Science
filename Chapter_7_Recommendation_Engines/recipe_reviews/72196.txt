Thank - You !!! I have been looking for a recipe that I could "adapt" to Chili's Raspberry Margarita. I used 1800 Reposado, Chambord and I added a shot of Cointreau AND .... WOW LUV IT !!

Didn't care for this. There wasn't enough raspberry flavor. Think it would be better with sugar instead of salt and also if it were frozen. Had to add some additional raspberry syrup to get the concentration of flavor that I desired as well as color.

Wonderful recipe. I served this in a sugar-rimmed martini glass and added a few muddled raspberries to the recipe. Delicious.

One of my favorite drinks!!  The  only difference is that I rim the glass with sugar and not salt.

My husband loved it just the way it was but I definitely will double the Chambord next time as I didn't taste the raspberry.  But it's still very good!

We loved this - I was looking for a similar drink to Chili's 1800.  I used 4 oz Sweet & Sour and changed cointreau and Chambord to 2 oz.  Yum!

Instead of sweet/sour mix do orange juice and squeeze a lime wedge.  I also garnish with sugar and orange wedge....much better

I was really looking forward to this drink and was seriously let down. Maybe it depends on the sweet and sour mix  but we did not care for it.

I only used 2 oz of sour mix and I left out the salted rim.  Very yummy, and I am planning on trying with different flavored liqueurs instead of raspberry, such as melon.

We really did love this drink.  Sweet?  Yes.  I did wipe the salt off the rim as I do whenever it is served this way.  I think that when I make my next drink like this I'll cut the sweet and sour mix to 3 or maybe 4 ounces and add one more ounce of tequila (I like a strong drink).  We liked this a lot!
