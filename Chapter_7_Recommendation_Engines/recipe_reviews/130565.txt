This pie is DELICIOUS!  The 1st time I made it, it did not set very well, so I made some adjustments for the 2nd time when I made 2 for a retirement party at work: be sure and let your ingredients get to room temperature and then I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked about an hour.  I served this with the "bourbon whipped cream" recipe submitted by POOKA75.  We had a ton of desserts for the party and both of my pies were the only desserts that didn't have any leftovers!  I had never made a pecan pie before this and I don't think I'll need to look for another recipe - this is great!

My husband thinks I'm evil.  He can't get enough of this pie. I've already make it twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for a Christmas party.  Everyone LOVED it and I got so many compliments!  Delicious.  And it is so easy to make!  I used light corn syrup with Ghiradelli 60% cocoa chips.  Make sure you use a deep crust or it will bubble over.  Also, I lined the chocolate chips on the bottom of the crust before I poured the batter in (I did not mix the chocolate chips in) and I really liked it that way because the chips stayed somewhat intact.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love pecan pie.  I love chocolate.  I love bourbon.  But I guess I really don't love it when these three tasty things are mixed together.  I only had one slice (and I made two pies).  It was OK, but I wouldn't eat it again.  However, I'm giving it 5 stars at the request of my friends, who fell head-over-heels for this recipe and devoured both of the pies.  So I would make it again for special occasions, but never for myself.

This pie was to die for - I had to make some changes out of neccessity: not enough corn syrup, so I used about 3/4 cup maple syrup instead.  I also used whiskey instead of bourbon (Jameson) and took the other reviewer's advice and used 4Tbsp.  Finally, I didn't add the chocolate chips because this was for Thanksgiving and we wanted something slightly more traditional.  The texture was out of this world and the flavour - mmm.  We served it with rum-spiked whipped cream (Dad was getting possessive of all his good 16 year old Jameson being used for cooking!).

Made this yesterday for christmas. Was a hit. Followed directions exactly. USed a glass deep dish pie pan. Spread the chips on the  crust as another reviewer suggested. Used light corn syrup. Store-bought refrigerated pie crust brought to room temperature first.

My brother had made a pie like this but wouldn't share the recipe so I found it here!  The only change I made was a bit more bourbon so that the finished product would maintain the flavor.

I made this exactly how the recipe stated.  The chocolate chips didn't melt and intertwine with the filling.  Instead, I have pecan pie with chocolate chunks.  Not what the recipe made me to believe.:(

By far the best Pecan Pie recipe I have had. We used Crown Royal for the bourbon, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!  Stayed close to the original recipe but incorporated some suggestions from earlier reviewers.  I arranged the chocolate chips over the crust before adding the filling, upped the bourbon to 4 Tbsp and baked an hour @350.  Perfect.  It was served in very small slices with a dollop of whipped cream.  This was our contribution to a New Orleans-themed party and everybody went crazy for it.  One guest sat down at the piano post-dinner and made up songs about Pecan Pie, as the leftovers disappeared one spoonful at a time.  Awesome recipe, Tracy!

Always a hit - very easy to prepare, whether with store-bought or homemade crust. FYI, I was one egg short and couldn't persuade my dearest husband to return to the grocery store yet again - but it turned out great regardless! Forgot to borrow mom's glass pie plate, but it worked out beautifully in those 8 3/4" disposable foil pie plates; lowering to 350 and cooking for an hour as another reviewer suggested seems to be a good move- for my oven anyway. I had no problems with the pie setting up right as has been problematic with previous pecan pie attempts. Thanks for the delicious recipe & excuse to have lots of extra bourbon on hand - makes baking much more relaxing ;)

I have made this one several times.  It is outstanding!  The flavor of the bourbon increases the longer the pie sets.  I usually make it a few days ahead and either freeze or refrigerate it.  Good stuff!

Used dark chocolate chips (spread over crust before adding batter), 4 tbs bourbon, & baked 1 hour at 350.  Perfect!!!  I should have made 2.

This is the BEST pie I've ever made and so easy if you use purchased crust.  Everyone loves this pie and I only had left-overs once (Thanksgiving - when we had so many desserts) and this pie is even better when it's been refrigerated!  The texture changes; it becomes firmer and the filling is more like caramel.  I will never make another type of pecan pie again.  This one is so good, so easy, and needs no tweaking.

Excellent pie. Followed advice in comments about putting the chocolate chips at the bottom of the crust before adding the filling on top, also increased bourbon to 1/3c. Great flavor, warm or straight from the fridge.

Fabulous! I took this to a dinner for 10 and everyone raved about it. Two people said it was the best pie they have ever eaten. I did make the adjustments suggested by others (1) 3 Tbs of bourbon; (2) chocolate chips placed on the crust with the liquid poured on top (3) baked for 65 minutes at 350. I don't see why I'd make plain pecan pie again.

Pretty good pie recipe. I'm not a huge fan of pecan pies but my family enjoyed it (made it for xmas dinner). I followed other's suggestions and: 1.) added 1-2 more tbs of bourbon (Maker's Mark) and 2.) sprinkled semi-sweet Ghiradelli chips on the crust not mix in the batter. I would also definitely make your crust and don't buy pre-made... it does make a difference. Pie turned out wonderful.

The taste of this pie is amazing.  I made it to the exact recipe, and it came out a bit oily for some reason.  I also had to bake my pie for an hour and 20 minutes before it set.  I might only use 3/4 cup chocolate chips next time as they seemed overpowering, and add a bit more whiskey as I could barely taste it.  I will definitely make this again with a few minor changes.

Great, have made 3 now. used 3 fat tablespoons of Bourbon, just filled bottom of pan with enough chocolate chips to make a single layer before pouring the mix on top. I want to try the bourbon spiked whipped cream but haven't got that far yet. 375 Degrees for 60 minutes could be a tad long, 2 pies at same time cooking and one is a tad dark.

This is my very first pecan pie I baked and it came out very nice!
I love pecan so much and I put the double amount of pecan.
I will definitely make it again!

Love love love this pie! I add a little more bourbon than normal, but it tastes amazing. Just remember to stir it well otherwise the corn syrup and chocolate separate while cooking.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. I didn't adjust anything, and everyone loved it. Next time I make it, through, I'll probably increase the bourbon by another tablespoon so the flavor is more pronounced. I used Maker's Mark.

Outstanding!  Our pecans are coming in here in SC and this pie is a frequent event at our home during this time of year.  I use JD Black and it cuts the sweetness a bit.  All my friends love this treat.

I prepared this recipe just as described with the only change being putting the chocolate chips on the bottom of the pecan mixture.  Overall, it was 'meh'.  I like each of the ingredients separate, but together they just didn't jive. The chocolate was overpowering and allowed the bitterness of the pecans to linger.  Pecans are subtly sweet and the chips were far too sweet.  I made two for Thanksgiving, but only served one.  I'm going to let the second one sit until Monday and bring it to work to see if the flavors meld as it 'ages'.
I won't make this pie again.

Fabulous pecan pie recipe. I used Wild Turkey 101 for pie and whipped cream but look forward to trying it with other whiskeys. The Crown Royal sounds particularly good. Super easy. I used my own special all butter pate brisee crust. For a totally homemade pie, it was easy enough and totally mind blowing.

FABULOUS!  I omitted chocolate, upped my Bourbon to 3+ tablespoons, made my own crust, and upped my chopped pecans to almost 2 1/2 c.  So many compliments!  And, simple, simple, simple!

This pie was delicious. This was the first time I had attempted a pecan pie and I wasn't disappointed. Even my husband, who doesn't like pecan pie, had a piece and enjoyed it. I topped this with a homemade vanilla boubon whip cream and some vanilla ice cream on the side. Awesome!!

I made this last night.  It was outstanding and our friends loved it too.  I will definitely make it again.  The only thing I did differently is that I made a crust out of chocolate wafer crumbs with a little melted butter and pressed that into the pie dish and up the sides; instead of pastry.  Much simpler and it increased the chocolatey flavour.  Do not keep this in the fridge or the chocolate pieces/chips will be too hard.

Pssst, I'm not really a great cook. But, this recipe has my family and friends thinking otherwise! Seriously, this recipe as written is excellent! I do "opt" for a couple of slight changes. As others have noted/recommended in their reviews, I increase the bourbon to 3 tablespoons. I also spread SOME of the chocolate chips across the base of the pie crust before pouring in the filling. The rest, I mixed in as directed. I also CHOOSE to use toasted pecans. And lastly, be sure to use a deep dish pie crust; you'll need it!
Update 11/2017 - I've made this pie a few times for friends and now I keep getting requests from others for the pie because they hear it is so good!

This was the hands-down favorite pecan pie this year! I put the chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie shell and pored the filling over top as mentioned above and the chips melted beautifully. I also used 1/4c bourbon and the flavor was great but not too overbearing. Will definitely make again!

I read all the reviews and made some changes of my own. I used 1/4 cocoa powder to cut the sweet of other comments. Also added 1 egg and 1 tbsp. flour. It actually came out great. 
Add bourbon whipped cream when serving for a super topping.

I made this as directed with no changes, except that I increased the cooking time by 15 minutes or so because  the center was not set at 50 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious - like a New Orleans restaurant quality dessert.  Next time, I would spread the chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust and then pour the filling on top, as some parts of the pie had more chocolate than others.

This was good but I think next time I'll use less corn syrup to help it "set" better.  I ended up baking at 350 for an hour and 10 minutes.  Also, the chocolate chips end up sinking to the bottom of the mixture while baking.

This pie was AMAZING!!!!  My husband loves pecan pie, and so I did some searching for an easy recipe to try for him for his birthday.  This was a hit, so well-liked that I had to make it again for my brother-in-law's birthday a few weeks later.  Then I entered it in a local pie contest and won first place for the "non-fruit" category.  

I am not an experienced pie-maker by any means, and I found this recipe easy-to-follow.  I have never run into any issues with bubbling over, or with failure to set up, or soggy crust.  I did make my own crust, so I am not sure if the roll-out crust might have that tendency? 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very rich dessert! I’ve never had leftovers when taking it anywhere. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Excellent. I didn't have bourbon, but used rum extract. I put it in a 350 degree oven for a little over an hour. Even my mother had a second slice, and when that happens, you know it's a keeper. Very good!

Very good but I had a bit of trouble telling when it was done. It seemed VERY wet at the recommended time but ended up being a little dry when I eventually took it out. Maybe I just need more experience with pecan pies.

Made just as instructed and got tremendous reviews! Everyone loved it. The second time around I [accidentally] added a couple/few more tablespoons of bourbon. It enhanced the flavor and made it even better!

Im going to rate these according to the rave reviews i got from my fam. I personally thought it was to chocolatey and prefer the traditional pecan pie but i can imagine how any chocolate lover would love this pie. I didnt taste the bourbon at all. Still very good and AMAZING according to everyone who ate it!

This is an a masterpiece. I am eating piece as I type and I am in heaven! I didn't have bourbon or I would have used it and I only had dark and milk chocolate so I used the dark and oh wow it is sooooooo good. I'll definitely make again and try the bourbon. I would highly recommend this pie! Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Yummy pie.  The bourbon definitely adds a "buttery" taste to the pie, which I found delightful.  I did not enjoy the chocolate in this pie, just my personal taste I guess.  I found that it took away from the bourbon flavor.  I will definitely add bourbon to my pecan pies from here on, just not chocolate.

YUM!  I didn't have as much corn syrup as I thought and had to use about 1/4 cup honey.  Great recipe.

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner today, and it got rave reviews!!!  My husband declared it "awesome" and my mom said it's one of the best pecan pies she's ever tasted.  It's extremely rich, so one pie goes a long way.  I'm planning on making another one to take to my in-law's this weekend. I did add one extra TBS of bourbon, (and had to cook it an extra 10 minutes for it to set, but I think that's my oven) but made everything else per the recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars b/c it was absolutely delicious and so easy!
