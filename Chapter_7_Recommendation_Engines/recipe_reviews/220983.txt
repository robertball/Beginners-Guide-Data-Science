The sauce was quite thin, so I thickened it with corn starch. Has a good, rich mustard flavor!

Just as our ham was coming out of the oven on Christmas Day I realized I wanted a mustard sauce like my mom used to make. This was bang on! So simple and so delicious! I didn't change a thing. Nice to make with simple ingredients I always have on hand. Exactly as I remember....

Loved the idea and made it with half the amount of sugar and still found it too sweet. The consistency was great and it had a pleasing color, but  if I ever make it again, I would be very sparing with the sugar, maybe 2 T. at first. Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce got complement at a potluck party! I didn't have sugar and replace it with 2 teaspoon of honey. As the mixture heats up it will thicken! Will make it again!

Followed the recipe as written with only one change: did not have white vinegar so substituted with same amount of apple cider vinegar. My egg was regular sized as opposed to a large egg. Used medium heat to until to gentle boil turned off burner and let cool. My sauce thickness veery nicely and even more so as it cooled. Very nice sharp flavour that complimented the ham so very nicely. (Also made an All three of us at the dinner table loved it. A simple recipe to follow for novice cooks like myself. Will definately make this mustard sauce again. repeat

It was fine but a little too sweet for my group so next time Iâ€™ll cut the sugar in half and add some Dijon to spice it up

Easy to make and seems to have the right taste but the recipe calls for 1/3 cup of vinegar. I think 1/4 cup or less would be more than enough, and as mentioned in the previous review, there is way, way, way too much sugar. We used 1/4 cup (60ml) and it was still extremely sweet. I'd suggest you start with 1/8 cup (30ml) and taste as you go. We ended up adding some dribbles of milk & thickened cream to dilute the acidity & that seemed to help a lot but I'd suggest you use the "less is more" philosophy to get the most out of this recipe.

This turned out really good! It was a tad too sweet for my liking so I'd cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup next time. The key is constant stirring and you can see it thickening and then just pull it off the heat as soon as it gets to the consistency you like.

If I made it again I'd almost half the sugar way too sweet perhaps add a small clove of garlic. My husband enjoyed it and said it was a little too sweet he has a very sweet tooth.:)

I didn't care for this. It was *really* strong and acidic. I did cut the sugar way back after reading the reviews, but then added more after tasting it. It was still really pungent and unbalanced. Sorry, I'll keep looking for the right sauce for me.
