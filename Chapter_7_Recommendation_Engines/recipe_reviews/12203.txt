THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER PIE EVER!  I was looking for a recipe as good as one an old friend of mine used to make--I think this beats it!  Everyone RAVED about how delicious this was with melted chocolate chips drizzled over the top.  I also made a double recipe in a 13 x 9 pan and cut into squares and put in mini muffin cups to sit out at a party--BIG HIT!

I did use an oreo crust to save time. The only thing I would do different is use confectionary sugar and eliminate the regular sugar. It makes a creamier consistancy. I put fudge sauce on the crust before putting in the filling. I also drizzled some on top and decorated with peanut butter cups.

This is a really great pie if you are in a fix and need something delicious and quick. But it's so rich that putting chocolate chips on top seemed to throw it overboard. A nice alternative would be very thin chocolate shavings. :o)

I use extra peanut butter and everything else stays the same.  Have used chocolate crust, oreo crust, and regular graham cracker crust.  I have been getting requests for this for years, since the first time I made it.  I crush Reese's cups on top, chocolate chips, or peanuts.  It is extremely easy to make, and can make ahead of time and freeze for later!

I have rave reviews for this easy recipe.  All the family request it for the holidays and it beat out my husband's ex-wife's peanut butter pie hands down.  That makes it a #1 winner!

OMG. This is one of the best desserts I have ever made on this site. I followed this recipe exactly minus the pie shell. It does not even need it. Blended correctly, this piece of heaven is delicious topped with hot fudge sauce and frozen. P.S. the white sugar in the recipe is fine, as long as it is blended in. You build some serious arm muscles mixing. But hey, think of it as burning some calories before you load up on them:)My family also can not get enough of this pie.

Made this today and it turned out great. I used an Oreo crust. I will take the advice of a few other reviewers and use less cream cheese or extra PB.

This is excellent!  I used Carb Smart peanut butter and powdered sugar. I also poured it into a chocolate wafer crust, but think a graham cracker crust might be a bit better.  My step-daughter said it was the best dessert she ever ate.  I highly recommend this.  I could eat it all day!!

This was super easy and I couldn't stop eating it. I was afraid it would be too cheese cakey but it was really delicious. A really good peanut butter pie with a hint of cream cheese. I would totally make it again.

This was almost too easy to put together. I also had every ingredient, so I didn't have to run to the store! Very creamy and wonderful. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter and it did not taste like cream cheese or a pb cheesecake. We did drizzle chocolate topping over it right before we ate it. Will make again!

Holy cow this was good, but very rich. Drizzled some chocolate syrup on top before putting in freezer. Will make again, but when we have more over to enjoy it. Thanks for a very easy dessert that was worth making!!!

I used a full cup of PB and a graham cracker crust for this pie.  I also layed some Peanut Butter Cups in the bottom of the crust before I added the filling.  I did not freeze this pie.  Thanks Karen.

A very rich pie. Good peanut butter flavor though a little heavy with 8oz of cream cheese, maybe 4oz would be better.

I made this for a potluck and it got many compliments.  I used a chocolate crust and drizzled chocolate on the top.  It is very thick and rich, so I suggest taking a small piece and have a BIG cup of milk.  A must have for peanut butter lovers.

The whole family loved this!  I put the filling in a ready-made graham cracker crust; we also melted milk chocolate chips and swirled the melted chocolate around on top before putting in the freezer.  It was SO very easy to make and great on a hot summer's day.  YUM!

Good but it tasted more like a peanut butter cheesecake than anything else.  Also it wasn't thick enough and didn't solidfy well even after leaving it overnight in the fridge.

My son was able to make this pie himself, and then took it to a 4th grade student potluck.  It was a BIG hit, and he was so proud that there was none leftover after the lunch!

I made this pie for a pitch-in at work.  People were lined up for it and everybody said it was really good!  I ran out before everybody who wanted a slice got one. I'll have to make two next time.  It's so easy to make too!

I brought this pie to an office function and it was such a hit!  We ran out of pie and the other desserts were untouched.

My favorite way to make peanut butter pie !!! It’s so much better with granulated sugar rather than powdered sugar

Very easy to make and tasted great. I cut back on the sugar and used  Cool Whip lite just to save a few calories. Also used  the 1/3 less fat cream cheese.   My family loved it!

Easiest pie recipe I've ever made and a definite keeper.  I agree with other reviewers that it is extremely sweet, so  I plan to experiment to make it a bit less sweet.   Thank you for this great new recipe!

I have made this twice as written.  Used chocolate crust both times.  Very rich, a small slice goes a long way. Made it for christmas and put mini green and red m+ms on top. For my dad's birthday I put mini chocolate chips on top. A new family fav.

This pie is delicous and very easy to make.  We used a grahm cracker crust which really complimented the pie.  Note:  the pie is extremely rich, much like a peanut butter cheese cake.
