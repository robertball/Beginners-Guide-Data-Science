This was amazing!  I did more of a 50/50 mix.  Added a little dried tarragon and a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes.  It was so delicious.  I didn't have shallot so I just used some onion. I only used a pinch of  S&P because it doesn't really need it because of the mustard. I'd swear that there were bread crumbs and parmesean cheese added, but there is not.  It's that good.  My hubby would like to try it with bacon next time. Thanks!  We'll see.

For my personal taste, I'll add more dijon mustard the next time, but we enjoyed this.  Watch your time, as mine was done in 30 minutes.  Very nice side dish.

I will definitely add more dijon mustard or less oil the next time I make this. I used yellow onions (did not have a shallot) and since I love garlic, I used 5 cloves of garlic. Mine was also done in 30 minutes.

Dijon Roasted Cauliflower Haiku: "Well, I do declare. This will be THE recipe, for cauliflower." I think 5 stars are for recipes that are absolutely perfect, no substitutes, modifications, or tweaks necessary, and this one is IT. So easy, so flavorful, what a great side dish! I love cauliflower, but this recipe made me love it even more.

Yummy. I usually just roast my cauliflower with olive oil, salt and pepper, and maybe some garlic - but this was a nice change. I might like even a little bolder Dijon flavor, so I may consider either increasing the dijon, or cutting back on the oil to make that flavor come thru even more. I did have shallots in the house - but if you don't I'm sure a little onion, or even the dried minced onion would be a fine substitution.

I'm not a huge fan of Dijon mustard, but my husband loves it so I was willing to make the "sacrifice".?? found it to be a perfect flavor combination with the mustard not too overwhelming. Couldn't stop eating it!

This was a good base to start with. Added lots of Dijon, 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/3 cup ricotta, 1/2 cup grated cheddar, celery seed, paprika, onion powder (no shallots on hand),  and a touch of honey. Also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Spread out cauliflower florets on a shallow pan, spooned sauce over florets, and baked at listed temp for 35 minutes. Every single bit was eaten up by the men in the house.

We added jalape√±o and red pepper for spice, then served it on a bed of arugula with a sprinkle of sharp cheddar and fresh chives. Very tasty! Thinking of ways to turn this into a taco...

I'm on a pretty strict diet and was getting really sick if steamed cauliflower so searched allrecipes for some other ideas. This really helped change it up for me. At this time, I can't use any oil, so only used a slight spray of Pam for my baking dish, then followed the recipe, but did double the mustard as other reviewers recommended. My husband is dieting with me to make it easy and he loved this. I can't wait to make it again with the olive oil.

This is a nice change than the usual roasted cauliflower with evoo & balsamic.  The dijon adds a nice flavor that isn't overwhelming.  I will make this again!

Quick-easy-delicious.  I went from ‚Äúhmm, maybe I could roast the cauliflower with some type of mustard sauce‚Äù to finding this recipe, prepping and cooking, and then having the family demolish it in about 45 minutes.  Modifications:  1) I only needed 25 minutes to cook, perhaps because my florets were cut smaller; and 2) used 3 T mustard instead of 2.  

Delicious and smelled wonderful cooking, my kids enjoyed it,  I enjoyed it and I admit that I am NOT a cauliflower fan.  Roasting was much better cooking method to bring out the flavor.

Since I had 2 heads of cauliflower, I doubled all of the ingredients, and increased the Dijon mustard and garlic. I didn't have shallots on hand, so I left them out. For the two heads of cauliflower, I added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley flakes mostly for color. In addition, I used butter instead of oil. OK, so I changed a bit of the recipe, but it provide me with inspiration. 

I baked the cauliflower at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. We like our cauliflower a little on the crunchy side, and baking it for 45 minutes would have made it mush. Since I cook veggies in quantity for freezing, I may make a Dijon butter sauce to put over the cauliflower when I thaw it out for meals. 

To the author, thanks for the inspiration for a tasty way to make cauliflower. We love it!

I really enjoyed this. After roasting for 30 min I made a second smaller batch of the mustard mixture minus the shallot and garlic. I added a bit of honey and some Parm cheese and put it back in the oven for 10.

Loved it. Great flavor. Next time I would use a bigger cauliflower, as it does shrink a lot after it is roasted.

I normally roast the whole head,  comes out fantastic. I add extra dijon and sprinkle parmesan cheese to top it off.

Everyone was happy with it, but did suggest more dijon for the next time. Also melted a little shredded cheese on top.

Delicious!  I used frozen cauliflower as I didn't have fresh. Baked a little longer.

Love the idea, but followed the recipe exactly and there was NO Dijon taste.  And I'm glad I was on top of it because it was done in 1/2 the time suggested.  
I will try again with maybe 3x the Dijon...

This was just OK for me. I prefer butter or olive oil to bake cauliflower. But thanks for recipe.

I thought it was just excellent. Didn't have shallots, and did not use the full amount of Dijon. Cooked for 45 minutes @ 400.

I usually roast my cauliflower with parmesan but was looking for something without cheese. This was really good! I might increase the amount of dijon I use next time though.
