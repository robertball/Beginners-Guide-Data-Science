Never use oil, only butter in the pan. The name in danish is Æbleskiver which means Appleslices (I know they're not slices, but that's the name). So if you want to make them like we do in Denmark, and always have done, you need to put a piece of apple in every one of them. 
When they're done cooking on one side put a small piece of skinless apple in to the middle, turn them around with a knitting needle to finish cooking them on the other side. You can also use applesauce instead.
Time to eat them, dip them in your favorite jam (we use jam from nordic berries like strawberry, my favorite), then dip them in icing sugar, eat and enjoy.
We're not only eating them at Christmas but at any occasion. More traditional Christmas cookies are ``Klejner (don't know what to call them in english)´´ and ``Pebernødder (peppernuts)´´.
I'll post recipes later.

I am also Danish. My Grandma taught us to break open the "ball" while still warm or hot and dip in brown sugar. mmmmm  She used a crochet hook to turn them over.

Very light. Delicious! I have owned a pan for many years but never used it until today. It was a very easy and delicious recipe.
It is best to use a knitting needle (really!) or a pointed stick to turn them.  A fork made too many holes and wasn't as easy to get them to turn right.  My pan may have been smaller, used less oil and batter in cup.  Preheat pan, and keep temp. constant.

My mother was danish and we all loved our special meals of Aebleskiver.  When she passed away I got her pan, but didn't know how to use it until I found this recipe.  My brother & I prepared it for our families on Christmas morning and it was just like mom used to make!  It will now be part of Christmas morning family tradition in our home.

This batter tastes wonderful but DO NOT USE OIL in each indent...especially that much. I have the typical sized aebleskiver pan and they turned out to be a bunch of little grease balls..they aren't supposed to have so much of a fried texture. Use a little bit of butter instead, and make sure the pan isn't too hot (medium to low heat). Since mine is a heavy cast iron pan it retains the heat really well and it if you have the heat too high it'll cook them unevenly and can be a bit messy. GREAT recipe other than that though, we loved it!

We never used Aebleskiver's for Advent but did have them as a special breakfast on New Year's Morning and loved them with a dolop od Raspberry jam in the middle and warm Raspberry sauce over the top, or powdered sugar.  Also, a little to much oil, try using a pastry brush with butter, works great.

Excellent recipe! I was raised eating Aebelskivers on special occasions and this is just the BEST recipe I've ever used. We added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, which was just the right touch. Enjoy!

Great fun to make and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I am Scandinavian (Swedish and Norwegian) and was given my Aebleskiver pan for Christmas. I couldn't wait to give it a try! They are a cross between donut holes and pancakes. The recipe states to turn them quickly (which I did the first two times I made them), but after doing some research I have learned that if you turn the pancake onto its side for about 30 seconds before completely turning over to the otherside, it will produce a more round shape.  It does make a difference.  I used the point of two steak knifes to turn them (I couldn't find my knitting needles!), and then a spoon to remove them when done. I can't wait to make them for my grandchildren!

Gluten-free flour conversion: 1/2 c white rice flour, 1/2 c cornstarch, 1 c brown rice flour, sifted together.  No need for xanthan gum or guar.  Everything else the same...I did also substitute soymilk soured with 1 tsp lemon juice for the buttermilk.  This converted beautifully - the whole family didn't even realize it was gluten-free!

Great basic recipe, especially if you are going to be filling yours with apples, cream cheese filling, preserves or other choice fillings.  My experience with the first batch went really well with the taste being plain and somewhat "eggy" but still very good with powdered sugar on them.  Before filling the pan again, I added a tsp vanilla, two tsp more of sugar and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. I made two with chopped pecans inside and drizzled with carmel topping along side some whipped cream (canned - admittedly)  Wow what a difference.  This is the recipe I will continue using - definately a big thank you to the contributor :)

Just a little tip: My great-grandmother added a teaspoon of cardamom to the yolk-mix. It gives a warm, fragrant flavor to them. It sounds odd, but you should try it. Yummy!

These taste just the way I remember from when I was a kid!  I got a pan a few years ago, however, I had no idea how to make them and the few times I attempted it, it did not go well. These worked great!  I didn't have buttermilk so I added two table spoons of vinegar to two cups of milk.

I had great success with these.  I experimented with the temp. of the stove top and had the best results around medium to medium-low heat.  Certainly not difficult and delicious to make.  I didn't bother filling them with anything (no jams, chocolate, or caramel pieces this time) and added about 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and cardamom to the batter--traditional Dutch flavorings from what I understand.

These were delicious! I love this recipe! I didn't have any buttermilk ... in fact, I was totally out of regular milk ... but I DID have 3 hungry kids, so I used 1 cup homemade plain yogurt and 1 cup reconsituted evaporated milk plus 1 tsp lemon juice. I'm sure they're just as delicious with the buttermilk, but am offering this substitution in case anyone can benefit from it.

Found an aebleskiver pan at a local thrift shop...I was the only one who knew what it was since I grew up near Solvang, CA, home of Arnie's Famous Aebleskivers.  So the first time I made this was a total flop, because the cast iron pan was not seasoned yet. 

I have found that for this recipe to work for me, the pan has to preheat for 20 min or so (Put the pan on, then mix up the ingredients) - also, I have to put oil in the cups each time I start a new batch of 7 balls.

The knitting needle approach works best for me. I wait for the edges to look a little dry, then turn the doughball 1/4 turn, allowing the next bit of batter to spill out and cook.  They aren't perfectly round like experts make, but they're getting there, the more often I make these.  

This has become our special Saturday morning breakfast.  I need two pans now, to make it go faster!

Great recipe - I added a filling of sweetened cream cheese by dropping a 1/2 t of cheese into the batter before turning them.  I think we will try a little blueberry jam in the centers next time.

Just got an aebleskiver pan (cast iron) and used this recipe to try them out. We don't drink milk, so I subbed in vanilla soy milk + lemon juice for the buttermilk, and replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat. I also used Pam to grease the wells instead of oil or butter. The first batch stuck a bit, but the remaining 4 batches came out perfectly. I filled some with nutella and some with blueberry jam. My husband ate his with maple syrup, I ate mine with raspberry jam - delicious!

Best way to eat these is to fill them with sausage crumbles and Havarti cheese then top with maple syrup... AMAZING! In Denmark they sell these in the shops in bags frozen for convenience, not bad...but nothing like those made at home.

This was soooo yummy.  Hubby got an aebleskiver pan for Christmas so we tried this out.  I had to make the batter, but he cooked it.  It was a little hard to tell when it was time to flip (hubby likes to keep the fire too high, on everything).  I found it easiest if we put some powdered sugar (we also used cinnamon sugar) in a gallon size baggie and shook the aebleskivers in the bags of sugar when they were done.  Very light and yummy.  Definitely use butter and brush the pan with butter instead of using oil.

This has been a favorite treat in my family for years. We do the topping a little different. If you haven't tried it yet do so! Its so yummy and more healthy then syrup. Take two cans of peaches and blend them up to look like sauce. (NO CHUNKS) use that as your syrup and for a real treat, whhip up some heavy whipping cream....YUMMY! That is my favorite way to eat aebleskivers!

These aebelskivers came out perfectly - light, fluffy and moist on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make them again.

Great recipe!  I like how the flavor by itself isn't super strong allowing it to be a medium for filling or toppings.  I used a Lodge cast iron ableskiver pan, and wooden chopsticks to turn them with success.  My experience with pancakes and waffles are limited so I wasn't sure on what heat setting on a gas stove so I used medium low and medium.  I guess I'll experiment more with temperature and oil amount for the exterior texture.

This is a favorite from my husbands family.  we also put oil on a papertowel and rub each indention with that instaed of using so much oil.  We also use a chop stick to turn these...works best!
I added a small bit of vanilla and served these with warm ample syrup (I did not have powdered sugar)

These were amazing! I sauteed some apple cubes in butter and added brown sugar to them and stuck them in the middle of the aebleskivers and it was absolutely delicious. I will never go looking for an aebleskiver recipe again!!!

My family loves these. We break from the Danish tradition and sometimes substitute these for pancakes...even though these are not actually pancakes. I have this fancy cast iron Aebleskiver pan in my kitchen that just calls out to me every now and again.  Great recipe.

If you've never had Aebleskivers you are missint out! Great recipe. I topped mine with a mixture of fresh/frozen strawberries and fresh whipped cream. A delight!

I am glad for the reviewers who advised using a small amount of butter instead all the oil.

This was really pretty easy and SOO delicious! Added 1 tsp of cinnamon to batter. We filled them with blueberries, then strawberries, then mini Reese's cups. Yum! We dipped them in powdered sugar, and brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. Put the extra in the fridge, so hopefully they are still good tomorrow.

This recipe was really fun. The pan can be found at amazon or Williams sonoma. I am not much of a breakfast person, but thought my family would enjoy these. Followed directions except, I sprayed the pan with veg oil. I also used a 2 tlbsoon ice cream scoop to fill each pan indention. Byw baking powder and soda are pretty much the same thing, not sure why a recipe would have both. I think this indicates that this is a realold ffamily recipe. Turning with the skewer was fun too. Tastes about like fluffy pancakes, but fun.

My first time out with my new pan.  I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe, I'm going to keep looking and experimenting.   I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon, which only made the batter a darker color that wasn't as pretty.  I doubled the sugar and it still wasn't sweet enough.  I did not put oil into the wells, simply sprayed with Pam and they didn't stick at all.  I filled the cups up to the top and they came out perfectly round on both sides, nice shape, now just need to find the perfect recipe.

Super easy recipe for Sunday morning breakfast. Kids love it when I pur peanut butter in the middle of some and jam in others. I especially like lemon curd!  Great little taste suprise.  Ingredients are easily had at the home without shopping for anything special.  Have them plain, with warmed maple sryup or dust with powered sugar (my personal favorite). Pans are not expense and Williams Sonoma sells them.

Outstanding recipe!!  I tried this with some twists you may like.  I left the basic recipe intact as it's perfect.  I put about a teaspoon of oil in each well of the pan instead of a tablespoon.  I then caramelized some apples in a saute pan.  I added the diced apple chunks to the batter after I poured it into the monk pan (abelskiver pan).  I also made some with ham and cheddar, havarti, chocolate chips. Simply add whatever additional ingredients you like after you pour the batter in the wells of the pan (sprinkle them on top of the wet batter). Then let them cook per the recipe and flip and cook the other side.  This is by far the best recipe I have tried for these treats!!

We halved the recipe, and out of necessity substituted brown sugar for white (we had already made a batch of brown sugar by adding 2 Tbs. molasses to 1 cup white sugar) and homemade buttermilk (1 Tb. apple cider vinegar to 1 cup milk and let rest for 5 minutes).  So good!  We used vegetable oil, but next time we'll try butter.

I've used this recipe once before and we really enjoyed it.  When I was little, my grandmother's church would make these at the county fair and sell as their yearly fundraiser. She's passed on now, but my daughters love hearing the story of me helping sell them while we make our own.

One question:  Can this batter be made in advance and put into the frig?  For how long and does it effect it at all?

I was looking for an aebleskiver recipe with buttermilk and this fit the bill. I substituted applesauce for the butter and then used butter instead of oil in the pan. Worked great. I also filled mine with a bit of jam. Not sure about using two tablespoons of batter for each one. I used one tablespoon for each and they were the perfect size.

My husband said that we don't need to wait until Christmas to have these again! :) I added a teaspoon of cardamom for a Scandinavian flavor. Delicious! I served these with the choice of blueberry sauce, powdered sugar and/or  cream cheese frosting. (I warmed the frosting so it was more like a glaze. I bought the Lodge cast iron pan from Amazon. I did not put an entire T of butter in each well, probably a teaspoon or less each time and they turned out very well. I turned them with a chopstick. I think I'll go have another! So yummy. If you don't have an Aebleskiver pan, the batter would be great as a waffle!

I made this recipe tonight- just like stated, except for the buttermilk I used 2 T vinegar and filled the rest of the measuring cup with milk. That is the only substitution I made- and they were fabulous! My dh bought a pancake puff for me and I looked around online for a few recipes. This one was what I was looking for and didn't disappoint!!! Not one person complained at all, they gobbled them up fast. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I'm trying to learn about the Danish culture and my family. Growing up my mother would make Aebleskiver for breakfast every weekend and it is similar to this recipe. My favorite way to eat it is with syrup, powdered sugar, fruit and orange juice. Velkommen Venner! Welcome Friends in Danish.

Whisk the egg whites after the batter so they don't get runny and the batter can rest.

My girls call these 'evil skivers' because they are devilishly addicting.  I add 2 Tbsp of sugar (instead of 1), a bit of cinnamon and vanilla and they barely hit the dusting rack before they are consumed.  I use a 7 hole pan, a wooden knitting needle and canola oil (butter burns).  These are so delicious!

If I *ever* get the hang of properly turning these, I'll make over and over again. Only giving a 4 as the oil is not necessary - I used Pam with no sticking problem - I just can't get them to set properly after flipping.  Made horrid mess trying to add applesauce so don't recommend.  Added cinnamon (lovely) - had no buttermilk, but regular milk worked just fine.  Also forgot to add butter with no adverse effect on taste.  Will keep trying.  Vanilla would be great addition.

For the first time aebleskiver maker:  There are pans made out of other materials, too, but they are more difficult to maintain a consistent temperature.  Cast iron is best.  In the Midwest, aebleskiver pans can be found in hardware stores.  I double the recipe and use two aebleskiver pans to make more of them in a short time for a family of 6.  I also have a silicone handle cover available to use over the cast iron pan handles as needed.  I set my stove burner between 4 and 5 and give it plenty of time to get to an even heat.  You don't want to add the oil (or solid Crisco, which is what I prefer to use; it's quicker & easier than pouring) until the pan is already hot.  Be prepared to put your aebleskiver batter into the pan very shortly after that.   I think that a gas stove works best, but I place a wire or steel unit 'platform' over the flame just to help stabilize the aebleskiver pan securely over the gas flame.  I use a long metal skewer to turn the aebleskiver.  To turn, you put the skewer right through the aebleskiver and flip it over.  I would not use 1 T. of oil for each pan.  For the first pan, maybe, but after that, maybe more like a teaspoon of the solid Crisco.  Put  the batter into the pan starting in the same hole each time, and ending with the middle because that one will cook a little faster than the ones around the outside of the pan.  I dust each platter of them with powdered sugar.  Serve with applesauce too.  A Christmas morning tradition for our family.

These were very good with powdered sugar on them, however I would suggest increasing the sugar to 2 Tablespoons. We had these in Pella IA and I remember them being sweeter than these were. I made some regular, then added a bit of peanut butter to some and added some Nutella to some. All were excellent!

We are not Danish but this is a family tradition and has been through my husband's life...we searched for a recipe to be perfect and this is it!  His mom gave me the pan when we got married, and we have been trying to figure out the best recipe since.  9 years and we found it!  Light fluffy and delicious! you can use EVOL too, it doesn't have to be butter, that is not true!  Figure out what you like...we make some with fruit inside, some without, we have all kinds of toppings for dipping (sugar, cinnamon-sugar, confectioner's sugar, maple syrup, whatever we have on-hand)...just figure out what your family likes!

Fluffy and tastes great. Simple ingredients always on hand. I use the powdered buttermilk. Filling: tart cherries or blueberries.  I have tried several recipes for aebelskivers and this is the best.

This is a good recipe for a dish that we've been making for years. I would suggest that you don't use a fork to do the turning, as it rips the Aebleskiver. A skewer or knitting needle has done the job for years for the Danes, so why change? Once you get the hang of it, you'll be flipping these over in record time.  Also, butter gives these a much better taste and texture than oil....oil is too greasy for something this delicate and sweet.

A boyfriends mom introduced these to me first by making breakfast for us one day.  I talked about them so much that my mom bought a pan for me on a trip to Solvang in  Calfifornia.  Since then (about 8 years or so), I made them every  time we had company, and now I make them at least once a month for my boyfriend and I.  If you don't have buttermilk, the boxed buttermilk pancake mix works well to.  I use a long wooden skewer for turning, forks never worked out right for me. It's try adding a piece of sliced fruit in the center before turning.  Break them open when still hot and your favorite toppings melt into yummy gooiness. My favorite toppings are butter, peanut butter or Nutella, my boyfriend loves cream cheese in his.

I've had very good results using this recipe.  I think beating the egg whites and folding them in is what makes the difference.  My daughter loves making these and does a better job turning the 'skivers than I do!

I made these this morning in my antique aebleskiver pan.  They were amazing.  Light and fluffy.  The only change I made was I used coconut oil to coat the pan after each cooking.  Can't wait to experiment with some of my favorite fried breads, like hushpuppies and corn fritters.  Thanks for an amazing recipe and a recipe for the proper use for this pan.

First time trying this recipe and it came out beautifully.  I had trouble turning them because I am not coordinated that way ... but they still tasted great.  I used the Raspberry Sauce on this site to top them and it too was delicious!

Great recipe! It's become a Sunday morning tradition in my house. Kids love em. I usually add some fruit filling like banana or apple, and a touch more sugar. Also, it makes WAY more than 30. More like 45-50.

Excellent recipe! First had these some 25 years ago in high school when a friend's mom made them. A couple of years later I fell in love with Solvang and bought a pan of my own. I've only made them sporadically over the years but this recipe is a keeper and will get these tasty morsels on our table more often!

We made these this morning, with no changes to the main recipe, and they were delicious!
A couple notes though - 
I tried butter, oil and then pam spray in the pan, and the spray worked out the best. With the melted butter in the batter, a touch of spray in the pan worked great.
We have two boys, so I thought it would be a safe bet to increase the recipe by 50% so we would have enough. That wasn’t necessary at all, the original recipe makes plenty. We had to toss a bunch of batter.
I used a heaping teaspoon of batter, then dropped some Nutella into the center, then covered it up with about a half teaspoon or so. I sprayed a touch of pam spray on top so they would be lubed up before flipping, and sprinkled some powdered sugar on them while they were cooling. 
I’ll post pictures in a moment, but they were just delicious.

I had mentioned to a friend that I was wanting to  make these, but alas I didn't have a skiver pan :( . He  bought me a cast iron pan a few weeks later, so I reciprocated with making skivers for him :)
This recipe was easy, delicious and brought me back to my childhood when Mom (or Grandma) would make them for me.  I will definitely be making these again

Love this recipe, I made a couple of minor changes, I replaced sugar with honey, and use coconut oil which gives a nice flavor. Also, while they are cooking, I put a little piece of cream cheese in the middle. So Good!

Though I was raised in the US, I'm half-Danish and have lived in Denmark so I know æbleskiver!  This is a good recipe, though I have two small recommendations: 1) Add a little cardamom to make it more traditional.  2) An extra egg white won't hurt if you want them to be a little fluffier.  

One more thing - use butter for the pan!  It's part of what makes æbleskiver taste so delicious.  Make sure the butter is clarified or it will burn. To clarify butter, slowly heat it until it bubbles and all the white solids rise to the top, then gently skim them off (cheesecloth is the preferred method if you want to do a really good job).  I also recommend that you use unsalted butter because it is typically fresher than salted butter.

My 12 year old son asked to make these after hearing about them on a tv show. I even had the right kind of pan. A "pancake popper" pan my husband had gotten me for Christmas from Target. We've made this recipe twice and love them. The only thing I do differently is spray each cup with cooking spray instead of using oil. I have a coconut oil spray that I like to use,but any would do. Very easy recipe!

Have used Grandma's recipe for years, very similar. Agree to use butter in pan, not oil. Also
experimented with electric cake pop pan, worked pretty well, but like the cast iron better.

Turned out well.  Easy to flip.  Next time I'll experiment with fillings...including maybe some red bean paste for a Korean flair.  Recipe is not sweet as is, so a sweet-type filling would be good.

The hardest part of this recipe was getting used to the aebleskiver pan.  I found that a 1/8 cup measuring cup was just about perfect scoop for the batter.  I looked at other recipes and one had some cardamom in the recipe and added it to mine.  While these were still warm, I drizzled honey over these pancakey, donuty little gems. I will be making these again!

Yum! I only use a bit of spray on the pan. 2 T oil seems kind of out of control. Cook slowly on medium heat to avoid doughy insides. I grew up eating these at friends' homes. LOVE THEM!

Tried this recipe this morning and it was excellent.  I made three alterations:  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter, used butter in the pan instead of oil, and used milk "soured" with white vinegar instead of buttermilk (what I had on hand).  The recipe made 7 batches of 7, so a total of 49 delicious puff pancakes.  My three kids devoured them all!

I use to have these at a harvest fair growing up and remember loving them dearly. I was putting away the food processor after making latkes last night and came across my mother's pan. That prompted me to make a special breakfast for my family. Absolutely delicious! Took the advice of others and added 2 tsp. of both vanilla and cinnamon. Didn't have buttermilk on hand, but added 2 Tbs. white vinegar to just under 2 cups milk. Worked perfectly. I thought the batter was a bit bland when cooking, but adding apple sauce and powdered sugar at the end worked charms. Definitely a keeper!

Recipe is solid. I'm going to try to reduce the baking powder and see if I still get good loft. Definitely use something pokey to turn. Also, more butter is better than less. Someone suggested brushing the rounds with butter but I had sticking. After cleaning the pan and discarding the wasted product, I put about a 1/4t butter per round. It cooked kind of like popovers or Yorkshire pudding.

I served these as breakfast two days in a row after I bought my cast iron aebkeskiver pan. I used sifted while wheat flour and I put a small scoop of tangy plum jam in after the first rotation.  They turned out like light, fluffy round, jam-filled pancakes.  I didn't find them to be as sweet as a dessert would be but I only added half the sugar.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were outstanding! I’ve made  Æbleskiver before, but the recipe I have previously used had a very pancakey taste. Not this recipe. This recipe produces light, moist, tender pillows of goodness. My 2 year old insisted they were “doughnuts”.

 I followed the recipe with precision. But I also added 2-3 blueberries inside each before turning, and after removing them from the pan, I brushed them with melted butter and rolled them in cinnamon sugar (I think that might be the “doughnut” connection).

It took a while to get proficient at turning them. I actually had better luck sort of pushing down on one side while up on the other. Only needed about 1/2 tsp oil in each cup. Also, used skim milk mixed with lemon juice as we didn't have buttermilk. Turned out fine!

These turned out perfect. We make aebleskivers every year at Christmas and this recipe turned out the best of any in year's past. Only changes: I cut it in half, which was plenty for three people, and brushed a little butter into the pan, not oil.

Also, we always put surprises inside each, like blueberries, peanut butter, chopped apples or chocolate chips, or a mix of such things.

Hi, like others have said, use butter not oil. The pan can be cast iron or non stick depending on where you buy it. The oil or shortening leaves a weird taste. I grew to love these in out household as my grandmother who is Swedish used to make these. I absolutely love them with lemon and powdered sugar or maple syrup. Also, I use bamboo skewers for making kabobs they work very well.

I have this recipes posted by the original person Lisa G. with the same photo,  but it doesn't use the egg yolks. I'm wondering if she logged on and edited the recipe at some point? I'm sending the recipe to a friend so double checked and found the discrepancy. Excellent recipe, even with no yolks!

Delicious especially with lingonberry jam. DO NOT USE OIL to cook them, use a pat of butter, like 1/4 to 1/2 tbsp. Also, the recipe calls for 2 tbsp batter but I could only fit 1 tbsp per hole in my pan

I make this a couple of times every year around the holidays. If you get the pan temperature right, they are a good representation of the original æbleskiver from Denmark. The trick is to have the pan hot enough that you get a good, firm crust developed just as the middle is cooked. Turn several times during cooking. Some prefer a soft exterior, but this is how my grandmother made them.

Since I cannot stand for very long, I have used Krusteaz pancake mix, adding two eggs, some cinnamon and nutmeg,  Turning them a quarter turn first time, then adding a teaspoonful of home style applesauce, then turning it again.  Following one last half turn I remove them from the pan and while hot drop them into a bag with cinnamon sugar, shake well, then serve.  Sometimes will not use the cinnamon sugar but will serve them up then drizzle a little clover honey over them.  Have filled them home made elderberry, blackberry, boysenberry or apple jelly, these I might sprinkle with just a very light coating of powdered sugar or just drizzle some warmed jelly over them.  Have them whenever I have the hunger for them.  Developed a taste for them at the Junction City Scandinavian Festival, where I got my first pan.  Had to give them up for almost 30 years while I traveled the world for Uncle Sam, kind of hard to carry cooking supplies in a seabag.  I am of Danish and Swedish Viking, and Prussian  ancestry.  So I love the foods and drinks from those areas.

Good recipe. I added vanilla, cinnamon and cardamom. Ate them with real maple syrup mixed with Stroopwaffle, very good. I'm going to try filling a few next time. These were my first attempt and I didn't want to go too far until I got the feel for them.

These aren't really aebleskiver.  They are small puffy pancakes.  The batter is too thin. Cardamom is a must and you have to beat the egg whites so that they are round balls.

Highly recommend using melted butter (clarified not necessary) rather than vegetable oil, and to limit the amount to about 2 teaspoons butter to 1 tablespoon of batter in the aebleskiver pan.  A bit more sugar in the batter is also quite pleasant. Pre-cooked apple piece in the center is brilliant and traditional, and all soft or pre-cooked fruits, Nutella, and similar make for lovely fillings as the mood moves you. Give them a bit more time than you first think in cooking.

We make Aebleskivers 3-4 times a year, and used this recipe for our Christmas breakfast.  The batter was really thick and wouldn't cook all the way through.  I lowered the heat which made them less fluffy.  It was a somewhat difficult batter to work with.  We ended up letting them sit in a warm oven to finish off cooking the batter.   Once they were done, they did taste really  good.

DO NOT SUB ANYTHING FOR THE BUTTERMILK! Milk with lemon juice makes sour milk, not buttermilk.  I feel like I can give a pretty good review after using this recipe three times.  The first time I made these I didn't have quite enough buttermilk so I used 1/2 cup of milk with 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk.  Although tasty, in the end, they were not pretty and I made a huge mess because the batter was a bit runny.  The second and third times I made these I noticed a big difference in the thickness of the batter using all buttermilk.  It was more like muffin batter except fluffier. I used a cookie dough scooper to transfer the batter from the bowl to the pan.  The only change to the recipe each time is that I did not use one tablespoon of oil in each well.  If I had, there would not have been any room for batter.  I used about 1/4 teaspoon of clarified butter in each well and then used a silicone pastry brush to make sure that not only the wells were covered but also the entire top of the pan because the batter does puff up and sometimes overrun the wells.  About the fillings: we found that we like them plain with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and a choice of toppings.  Some like thinned jam and others like maple  or pancake syrup.  Thank you Lisa G.!

I found a gorgeous cast-iron aebelskiver pan at the thrift store and went searching for recipes. This is the perfect one! Not too sweet, so perfect for savory and sweet fillings alike. We did plain, fresh raspberry, fresh blueberry, nectarine butter (like apple butter), and sausage gravy. I didn't get perfect spherical balls, but I'm sure it's more of a technique issue than a recipe issue. These taste like the ones from my childhood! Awesome!
