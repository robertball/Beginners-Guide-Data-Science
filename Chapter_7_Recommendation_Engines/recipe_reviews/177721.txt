This is a stunning, very tasty, restaurant quality pork recipe!  Truly a 5 star rating!  I added a bit more Dijon mustard and it turned out great!  My girlfriend was raving about this dish and so was I!  The mushroom Dijon sauce is unbelievable and it suits perfectly pork tenderloin.  I accompanied this dish with Dijon mashed potatoes and Cajun deviled eggs, also with Dijon as an ingredient, as an appetizer, along with the juicy tomatoes fried in basil and thyme!  DELICIOUS!!  I will definitely make this dish again!

The only thing I added was onion when frying the mushrooms. It was a delicious meal. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes with green beans on the side. Next time I will double the dijon mustard for personal taste but it was quick & easy! Thank you!!

Pretty good.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I used cider vinegar.  Also - I used regular mushroom soup.  It had a nice kick to it and their was plenty of sauce to cover noodles, rice, etc.

Soooooo good. I used thick-cut pork chops so I cooked them in the sauce for about 20 minutes, rather than the 10 that the recipe suggested. Very good and couldn't be easier.

Love this recipe!  I didn't use the oil or the wine, and it came out fine without the added calories.  I cut the chops to bite size pieces to make it more kid friendly and served it over egg noodes.  Made steamed broccoli on the side, and we were at the table in 30min.  I would have rated it a 4, but when my hubbie and kids asked for seconds, it got all 5 stars!

The sauce tasted a lot like a strogonoff recipe I found on the site.  It was very good, still, and I sent it to work with my boyfriend for lunch.  We had it over rice, with mashed turnips.

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because my pickypants husband said it was OK.  Simple, basic ingredients, easy and fast to cook, nice kick with the combination of mustard and wine.  I'll make it again, even if he did give it an OK only.

This was very good; didn't have Dijon mustard, so used a roasted garlic mustard I had on hand.  Perhaps because we didn't use dijon, it didn't have the mustard punch I was looking for, but quite good. Hubby loved it.  It will be worked into our winter menus for sure.

Made this exactly as stated except that I probably used 1/3 cup of milk instead of 1/4 because I was worried that it was too thick to boil properly.   I was not impressed.  I like dijon, but the strong flavor just didn't sit right with us.  It wasn't bad, but it was a long way from great.  I don't think we'll make this again.

5 stars does not give this justice, I would give it at least 10.  I did not change or add anything to this recipe, because it was fantastic the way it is.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.  It will be our "go to" for many years to come.

The lemon pepper seasoning added nothing; it was not tender when prepared as directed; the taste was bland.  I reheated the leftovers the next night with a barbecue sauce that simmered for an hour and a half to make the chops edible.  I will not make this again.

Bravo, what an incredible dinner. So rich and creamy, full of flavor. I browned my (thick) boneless chops and added fresh baby bella mushrooms with onions. My chops were fully cooked in 20 minutes. Tender, moist and juicy.

This was delicious!  I ended up adding twice as much wine to taste and my husband and 16 year old daughter devoured it!  Highly recommended.

Really delicious!  I did decrease the amount of Dijon mustard and I deglazed the meat pan with more white wine (which is what I then saut√©ed the mushrooms in).

This is very good! Who would have thought that 2 tbsp of wine and 1 tbsp of mustard would make such a big difference to a canned soup? Great flavours. Definitely worth repeating!
