This was delicious and simple to make. I rimmed the glass with sugar before serving. This was very refreshing and I will make it again! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

As is, this recipe was waaay too strong for us.  I had several people taste test after making according to recipe and everyone agreed that you could taste nothing but the tequila.  After adding additional frozen fruit (at least a cup more) and more orange juice (to taste) it was very tasty and refreshing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
