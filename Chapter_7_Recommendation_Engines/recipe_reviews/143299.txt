I added a splash of my favorite white balsamic vinegar to the vinaigrette. Also, common sense dictates you toast the bagel first. Raw bagels are nasty!

My daughter asked for these for her lunchbox, which means it's a winner!  We grow our own radishes and arugula, and will have our own tomatoes later this Summer, so this is a perfect way to use our garden for a quick and healthy meal.  We prefer the thin bagels over regular, and pictured is a whole wheat version.  The cream cheese mixture has a subtle but savory flavor, and combined with the spiciness of the radishes and arugula, it's a definite treat.  I'll make these often when my garden grows!  Thanks!

Just as the submittrt states, "it's quick, easy, and healthy" - perfect for a light lunch! Like others, I toasted the bagel first. Since I didn't have radishes on hand I used thin sliced English cucumber instead. Perfect with a tall glass of iced tea!

Yes, I made some changes. I used some on hand ingredients. I used balsamic vinegar instead of vinaigrette and Sandwich Thins instead of bagels. Someone else substituted cucumbers for the radishes, so I used both! Good! Made it a second time with more generous spread of cream cheese and substituted sandwich pickles for some of the cucumbers. Will make again.

A great sandwich for a light lunch, I did toast the bagel but otherwise followed the recipe.  The radishes are especially good here. Thanks for sharing!
