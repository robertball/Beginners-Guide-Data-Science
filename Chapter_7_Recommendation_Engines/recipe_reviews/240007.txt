I have also used Palmer's "Creepy Peepers" chocolate eyeballs for this recipe.  They are the right size, individually wrapped candies and you can get a 10 ounce or 1 pound bag.  They are under $6.00 for the pound size bag. Chill and cut as recipe states before using. Try using Reese's mini cups upside down as well.

I thought this was a cute idea for Halloween. I used my original recipe for peanut butter cookies and then made the spiders on top. When I make my own peanut butter cookies I do not roll them in sugar or use shortening. One stick of butter is enough. I may try adding vanilla next time to see if it makes a difference in taste.

A big hit at my grand daughters Halloween party at school! The cookie is a very good peanut butter cookie. I used mini peanut butter cups for the body, and mini marshmallows cut in half for the eyes. We used a dot of chocolate icing for the center of the eyes. Adorable and tasty!

We had trouble cutting the truffles when they were cold-they shattered. It worked better at room temp.

These were so cute! I used mini Reese cups instead of the Lindor chocolate - I saw another reviewer did that and I liked that idea. I thought these turned out cute and tasted great. Only a couple things  - these only made 36 cookies for me instead of the 48 and they weren't that big. I used the blunt end of a muddler to put a hole for the chocolate but it still wasn't big enough. I would say put your chocolate in the refrigerator then stick them on the cookies when they come out of the oven. The holes I made weren't big enough and once the cookies are cooled a little, they won't budge and my chocolates were floating over the hole. It still looked ok but when you bit into it, there was a gap which made it harder to eat the cookie and chocolate together. But overall, they were cute and tasted great!

These were adorable! I did everything as written, and the cookies on their own are just okay. I might use my own cookie recipe next time. Thanks for a cute idea!

These turned out very good.  I found Dove "Ghosts" at the store today, which turned out perfect because they're already in half.  Not sure whether these are always available, but they worked perfect.  Also put the eyes in when the cookies were out of the oven after about 7 minutes.  The chocolate was nice and soft, and the eyes went on perfectly.  Used a tube of pre-made chocolate cookie frosting by Betty Crocker for spidey legs.

Huge hit!  I used malted milk balls for the centers so that I would not have to cut anything.  Got 1 tub of white frosting, put about 1/4 of it in a piping bag for the eyes, the other 3/4 of the frosting, I added cocoa powder and about 1 Tbl milk and put that in a piping bag for legs and eye dots.  Wanted the frosting a little "stiff" to look like leg hairs. Ewww. Worked great!

These are very cute.  I made them for my son's preschool class.  I used peanut butter cups as well, and red gel for eyes.  They were a hit.  I didn't get 48 balls out of the dough, but it didn't matter to us, we got about 30 balls.

I have an impatient 4 year old, so I did these semi-homemade style. Used premade peanut butter cookies (Recee's break apart cookies from Publix). Put two of the cookies together and rolled into a ball, and dredged in sugar. Baked 12 minutes on 350, took out, made a dent with the back of a tablespoon, and put back in for 3 more minutes. Waited for them to cool, and used premade chocolate decorating frosting, and pipped a circle blob to make the truffle stick (tried adding tuffle while cookies were hot, and they just melted). Used same store bought frosting (the kind in a bag with a tip attached), to attach eyes and make legs.

Turned out good enough for family and friends, although dont think they'd be good enough for a bake sale. 

4 year old had a blast, and didnt ruin the kitchen. Also, was super speedy.

Me and my boyfriend made these cookies to get into the Halloween spirit and they were delicious! We used milk chocolate truffles and they turned out great. The recipe is really easy and they’re so fun to make!

These turned out REALLY cute, but they have turned into kitchen Halloween decor because nobody is eating them. I followed the recipe to a “t” and they are dense and cakey.

Cookies were great! I made it simpler by pressing a mini Reese's peanut buttercup into the center right when they were out of the oven and using store bought black decorating frosting for the legs!

The end result was OK, but, cutting those truffles in half was a pain!   A lot of waste!   I would use mini Reese Cups next time for sure!   I just thought the truffles would be better - not!   Taste was good!

These were fun to make with the kids!  They taste a lot like peanut butter blossoms we make every year at Christmas.  They do take some time, but worth it once a year.

Error in recipe: calls for making "48 balls" but only 24 cookies. Actually 24 balls is correct, not 48. That said -- PERFECT cookies, and I've never liked peanut butter cookies. Will be making them AGAIN in a week for my grand kids. The "kids" at the office LOVED them.

I used peanut butter cups and cooked with the cookie yumm.. I might try more peanut butter and also perhaps try adding some cocoa next time.
