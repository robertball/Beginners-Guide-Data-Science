Great as a starting point, but in my opinion this needs some work.  First, I used only half the vinegar called for yet Hubs and I both thought it was still too tangy. Also, this is a creamy white dressing, so I thought white wine vinegar was a better fit than the red, of course my preference would be to leave the vinegar out altogether - there's plenty of tang in the lemon juice.  I tasted this after I mixed it up and the Worcestershire was very prominent.  It settled down some as the flavors had a chance to marry, but I'd still either cut back on the Worcestershire or, again, leave it out altogether.  I definitely liked the additions of the chives, shallots, Dijon and celery seed, but still felt it needed an extra herb...I added fresh dill.  Finally, as a salad dressing (as opposed to a vegetable dip) it was a little thick, remedied easily enough with a little more buttermilk.  Once I tinkered with it to suit our tastes, Hubs and I both loved this, which we enjoyed on a tossed green salad.

I have made this recipe before, and I loved it (as well as my friends). I found it to be a little too tart, so I added a bit of Splenda to give it a sweeter edge.  I also had to add some salt to give the spices a bit more punch.

I really enjoy this recipe, but it seems a bit runny. I also add some extra spices and fridge it for a bit to let it set up some. I love kicking it up and using it in a chicken pasta salad.

Used this recipe as a veggie dip, so I left out the buttermilk to keep it thicker. Based on other reviews, I halved the amounts of lemon juice, red wine vinegar, & worcestershire sauce. To suit our tastes, I also added 1/4 tsp dried dill weed. The end result was a delicious ranch dip! Will be making homemade ranch dressing from now on. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I love this recipe and I don't like Ranch Dressing. It makes a fabulous dip for veggies - I left out the buttermilk to use as a dip! Great!

I agree with the other reviewers, this is way to acidic. The Worchestire sauce is also to dominant in this dressing. I will not be making this again.

A little too acidic for my taste. Reminded me of exactly what I don't like about bottled ranch dressing. Maybe leave out the vinegar and/or lemon juice next time.

I agree with some of the other reviews in that there was a little too much worchestershire sauce, red wine vinegar and lemon juice. There was just too much going on and the flavors fought for control. I'd like to try this again with the lemon juice, red wine vinegar and worchestershire halved as well as the chives and shallot increased. I think then it might be close to where it needs to be.

This is a good dressing.  I use it more for a dip.  Adjust the buttermilk accordingly for thickness.  A little cayanne pepper gives it that little pick me up to make it even better

This recipe is very good! I prepared it and let it stand over night. It is excellent! I use it with the restaurant-style oven baked chicken wings as a dip. It is a match made in heaven! It is fantastic with salads that only contain leafy greens and no other veggies! I felt like I was eating one salad I had over a bistro in Paris! The runny texture can be fixed with a bit of refrigeration. I do however wonder how long does it last in the fridge though...

Excellent dressing, but was too tart for me.  Next time I'll reduce lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and mustard.  Also added additional garlic and minced dill.  GREAT on salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love it. We used it to make chicken wraps. I suggest not to change a single ingredient, but I do recommend that you make it ahead of time, because it´s better to let the ingredients blend properly.

Quite good, and gets better over time after chilling and letting flavors marry. A little in the tangy side for my taste, so I would decrease the red wine vinegar.

I made 2 changes: half & half instead of buttermilk (had none), and basil as the main herb. It's delicious and easy to make.

Tried it as written the first time and didn't care for it. I tried it again and left out the red wine vinegar and the Worcestershire, substituted an equal amount of Riesling white wine and I think the results were super.
