Something is wrong with this recipe.  There was no way to form dough.  Please check.

I was surprised to see this recipe.  Being from an Italian household, I grew up on these cookies.  In fact, I have a batch in the oven now.  My mother chose to frost and sprinkle them, but I prefer them plain with my coffee!!  Delicious.  My ingredients are similar w/the exception of adding baking powder.  
I roll mine in a long rope and cut them on a diagonal, so they form small biscotti shaped cookies.

Great recipe.  Just what I remembered eating as a kid.  Dont get intimidated by the dough.  Keep working it together and add another egg if its too dry.  You work it like fresh pasta dough, believe it or not.  Recipe comes out great.

Excellent recipe. I'm so happy I tried it. Could also be used with any flavoring besides anise extract. Dough and cookies came out perfectly!!!!

Burnt most of the batch because temp reads 450 so I cooked the rest of the batch @ 325 for 15 min which they came out perfect and delicious. I think it also helps to use the pastry attachment on your kitchen aid.
