Didn't have EVOO on hand, so used a couple slices of butter in the boiling water.  Other than that, followed the recipe.   Soooo easy!  Came out perfect.  After I poured the boiling water onto the rice in the pan, I spread the rice to make sure it was level before I put it into the oven.
Added:  I have used this method to the exact recipe many many times now........perfect!   ADDED 01/08/19   So after making this to the recipe many times and having PERFECT rice EVERY TIME, I decided to experiment.  I have used chicken broth instead of water, have added in saute'ed onion and celery or frozen (thawed) mixed veggies, this recipe STILL comes out perfectly.    I also have used the leftovers to make confetti rice, fried rice, and skillet green pepper casserole.   I have frozen left over rice with success for later use.  Most versatile recipe I have come across on Allrecipes.  Update 2-22-20  Accidentally used Basmati rice, and it came out perfect also......

I was baking some enchiladas, and needed a side dish. I had some brown rice in the cupboard, so cooked (1/2 recipe) this as directed. After it was cooked, I added a pint of my homemade salsa, to give it a mexican taste. Was tender and delicious. Very good base recipe that could be adapted for whatever type of meal you are serving, or serve plain.

I never liked the consistency of brown rice, it usually comes out chewy or gummy.  So when I saw this recipe I decided to try it, and I'm so glad I did.  It comes out lighter and fluffier than I thought possible for brown rice.  It makes a ton so I make it on the weekend and then have leftovers for stir fry or whatever later in the week.

I must say this recipe is delicious! My first experience with brown rice was not good. However due to lifestyle changes I decided to give it another shot. Followed this recipe exactly and I am now in love with brown rice!

The rice turned out fluffy and delicious.  A lot better than my stove top attempts which turn out gummy.   I experimented by adding 1/4 cup black rice  since I had it on hand and it turned out tender too.

Excellent, excellent, excellent method. I made mine in a tagine (basically a dutch oven) and will never boil brown rice again. At this temperature for one hour, this rendered a fluffy, soft rice. If you plan to use the rice in other recipes (to be frozen, refrigerated, or re-heated), I suggest either turning the temperature down a bit or baking for less time. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is absolute perfection! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and WOW!, the rice turned out beautifully. It was fluffy, tasty, and had just the right amount of bite to it. The second time I made it I added 1tbsp minced garlic, 2tbsp dried diced onion, and 3tsp better then bouillon chicken paste, very yummy! This recipe is terrific as is, as well as being a wonderful base to play with, thank you for sharing it!

I have never liked any brown rice before trying this recipe. It has a special nuttiness that is wonderful. PS I've made this twice now with two different brands. Both times it turned out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this using Brown Jasmine Rice and the house smelled wonderful.  It baked in a covered casserole dish.  We enjoyed it with stir-fry beef sirloin strips and vegetables.

I could see where once perfected, this would be great.  I followed the directions to the letter, but mine came out a little dry with quite a bit of sticking to the bottom of the baking dish.  I wonder if it was because I did not make a full recipe.

It came out perfectly. The only thing I would do differently is add less salt. Finally an easy way to make rice - effortless and delicious. I added some turmeric - it made it yellow. I'll make this again - and soon. So easy.
