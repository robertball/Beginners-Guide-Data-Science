This was a very good recipe. I didn't want anything spicy so I omitted the chiles and I used regular sausage instead of Italian. I wanted a little something with sweetness so I think adding 1/4 cup of cocktail would be awesome in this recipe. I made it for a scrapbook party and it was a hit. I had the recipe printed out and I had to give it away that night because someone wanted the recipe. I'll most likely be making this again. Thank you.

I made this last night for company and it just didn't turn out well.  I followed the recipe exactly but it was runny and didn't have much flavor.  I cooked it for about 3hrs. and eventually added a bunch of cheese to thicken it up.  I don't know why it's called a "dip"-it's just too hard to eat that way.  My total cooking time was about 6hrs.

I used 2 lbs. of sausage..one hot the other mild.  I also used a whole container of chopped tomatoes that you get in the produce dept. about 1/2 container of chopped onion and 1/2 of bell pepper..to save time!  I only used 1 can of the chile peppers.  When the veggies were tender, I added some fontina (Italian) and munster cheese.  Delish!  I served with the garlic bagel chips and Scoops!  It was the hit at our Italian appetizer night!

I took this to a party this weekend. I doubled the recipe and put it into my 5 qt. crock pot.It was gone in minutes!!! Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. I served it with Tostitos Scoops so you could get lots of the dip with each bite.  Thanks Lois for a very yummy and differant dip. My friend suggested thinning it down a little bit with either milk or half and half, saute the peppers and onions with the sausage and serving it over pasta for a meal. Can't wait to try it that way too.

I made this for a family dinner and was somewhat disappointed.  It was very bland and we kept adding ingredients to it to give it some flavor.  IF I ever try this again I will use spicy sausage and a couple cans of spicy Rotel instead of the chilis and tomatoes.

Very hearty dip.  I use hot italian sausage links and grilled them along with the peppers (one red, one green) and onion.  Also added some roasted garlic.  Next time I would maybe cut back an ounce or two of sour cream to make even thicker.  A drained can of diced tomatoes w/ gr. chiles work well.

Love this dish! For a party, I made 2lbs of regular mild sausage, 8oz sour cream, & 1 1/2 packets of cream cheese mixed in with green pepper, red onion & tomatoes (a 15oz can of diced tomatoes helps save time). I cooked the sausage in the skillet first to drain the fat. Then I let it simmer with everything else on low for a couple of hours, otherwise you'll want to cook on high for an hour so the veggies are soft. It was not runny & still very tasty despite the cut in sour cream & cream cheese. It was gone in minutes! Also recommend a crock pot liner to cut down on cleaning time.

This was delicious! To save from cutting veggies up I threw in a can of rotel. My guests loved this!

Excellent!  Made this for a Christmas party and it was gone before anything else!  Started out slow and didn't look like it was going to come together, but it sure did.  Give it a full hour to hour and half before serving for all of the flavors to join together. Also added chopped banana peppers and used hot italian sausage.  Served with Scoops chips. Making this again for NYE.

OK for me I don't really care for the flavour of the Cream Cheese in here and felt the flavours are a little flat.

I made this on saturday for a wedding reception at our local Moose Lodge. What a hit, I doubled the recipe and it was gone in an instant.. Many compliments! The only change I was sauteing red onions before adding to the mixture.

The onions were still very crunchy and raw-tasting even after 2 hours on high. I also found the dip to be fairly bland.  Next time, I would probably add less sour cream, sautee the onions, add a little salt, and add rotel instead of the green chiles and tomatoes. However, the guests at the party I attended enjoyed it.
