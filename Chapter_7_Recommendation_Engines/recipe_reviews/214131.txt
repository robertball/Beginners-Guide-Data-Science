I think how good this tastes will depend on the canned lentil soup you use.  I used Amy's Organic Lentils w/ Vegetables and the soup was not good to start so the overall casserole was just okay.  I used fresh red bell peppers instead of canned and added diced onions and 1 crushed garlic too.  Also, I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes instead of nuking it.  I think I'll try it again but making my own lentil soup (which I know defeats the purpose of this quick recipe!).

This was a good recipe, not being vegetarian I added hamburger, and skipped the can veggies and added some carrots precooked in the microwave. It made a simple main dish and would be good as a side dish too.

Awesome!  How many ways have I altered it?  Probably different each time!  The roasted red peppers MAKE the dish though, so don't skimp on them.  I usually add kidney beans and use frozen instead of canned veggies.

This was delicious! I used an organic lentil soup, and substituted 2% milk sharp Cheddar cheese. It was slightly watery, so I plan to use less of the soup in the future.
