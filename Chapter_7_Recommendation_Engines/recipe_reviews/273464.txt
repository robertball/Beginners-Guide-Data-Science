This is very good chicken! I did the recipe exactly as stated except I used aluminum foil sheets. I made packets with them as I was out of parchment paper.Which worked out well. My husband raved over this chicken which is a huge compliment. Thanks Nicole for the recipe! Will def make again!

I took the cooks advice and used a couple more herbs. I happen to like rosemary and basil with chicken so I minced 1/2 teaspoon of each into the  rub mixture.  I  also   used Natrel lactose free   butter in place of butter.( dairy intolerance)
Followed the recipe and ended up with a very moist piece of chicken. Will make this again.
Thank you for the recipe.

I was trying to keep this recipe as low fat as possible so I followed the recipe except I didnâ€™t add the butter. Very moist and flavorful!
