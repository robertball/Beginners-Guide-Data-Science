Normally I don’t care for “formal” fruit salads as they tend to include a lot of other stuff beyond the fruit – like cream, yogurt, marshmallows, nuts, etc.  I appreciated the simplicity of this one which allowed the fruit itself to shine.  The citrus syrup seemed to bring all the flavors together, contributed a just right sweetness and prevented the fruit from turning color.  Versatile too, since this would work with whatever fruits you choose or have on hand.  I made this for just Hubs and me, so I just tossed the fruit and syrup altogether and served the salad in individual dessert dishes.

I made this yesterday and it was the talk of the party.  EVERYONE loved it.  I did not change a thing. One change - I did not layer it but mixed it all together and it was so beautiful, mixed together.  The syrup was great too.  There were about 70 people at the Picnic and people kept coming back for more.  I made it bigger than called for and it still went faster than anything else.  A definite keeper!!!  Wish I could give it more stars.  I acutally cut up everything the night before except the banana, and even made the sauce the night before too.  Then a few hous before I served it I tossed it together, then cut and added the banana.  YUMMY

Absolutely wonderful! I made no changes or substitutions. I did use organic fruit and green seedless grapes. We ate every bite of this fruit salad. I think this would be great with cubed melon and either raspberries and blackberries, too.

Excellent recipe! Be careful not to cook the sauce too long on the higher heat because it will be too thick to mix into the fruit. I put this with just fresh pineapple, strawberries and blackberries and it was delicious!

I served this salad yesterday at a luncheon with girlfriends.  It was the most beautiful, delicious fruit salad I have ever served.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I cut up all of the fruit the night before and made the sauce and poured over and let it marinate in the fridge overnight.  I added the bananas the following morning about 3 hours before my event.  The fruit salad is absolutely bright and beautiful and it tasted so, so good.  This is a keeper for sure and I recommend it to all of you!!!!!  PERFECT in every way.

Way too sweet.  Does not need the brown sugar or vanilla.  The fruit is sweet enough  & has plenty of flavor on it's own.

very good way to jazz up a simple fresh fruit salad without making it unhealthy.  I added fresh lime juice and lime zest also.  I took the advise of another recipe and sprinkled some cinnamon in the sauce.

This is a really solid go-to fruit salad. I prepared it for Thanksgiving. It would work just as well for summer picnics. One cautionary note: I added some raspberries, which don't hold up well. In fact, they fall apart. So if you make your own choices about fruit, avoid raspberries.

I rate this a 5 for these virtues:
1) Flexibility: I've been able to make substitutions and leave out ingredients I have, no problem.
2) Beauty: It's a really attractive salad that keeps it's color due, I would guess, to the citric acid and sugar (in our case, honey).
3) Ability to make ahead of time.

Together they've made this a staple of our summers.

This is so good!  My grocery store was disappointingly low on fresh fruit so the salad only had mango, pineapple, red grapes, and kiwi, but it was great anyway.  I didn't want a creamy or strong tasting dressing for the salad since we love the fruits as they are and this one was perfect.  It added a bit of sweetness and flavor, we especially enjoyed the vanilla (and I'm not normally much of a vanilla fan).  I will definitely make this again.

Great fruit salad! The sauce was enough to dress up the salad without adding a ton of extra calories. I took this to a party and everyone thought it was very good. I will definitely be making this agian.

This is terrific.  Used the fruits I had on hand (pears, grapes, blackberries, oranges, bananas, strawberries) and followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!  We are making this for the 2nd time within a week.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Don't taste test until until everything has been marinating. If you taste the sauce without the fruit it will come across as a little bitter and really not the true flavor of the dish. You'll just have to trust us. Served it to company & everyone loved it. I didn't use the Kiwi or blueberries and added extra banannas. So you can customize this to your favorite fruits. I also mixed it altogether like others suggested. I have a small frig so I couldn't marinate in a trifle bowl.

This made a beautiful & refreshing fruit salad, but my sauce didn't thicken up at all and my fruit ended up swimming in a pool at the bottom of my bowl. I drained some of the sauce out before serving (I did let it sit in the sauce until serving so it could soak up the flavors).

We served this for a golf outing and it was wonderful!  It looked great when it was made and still looked beautiful the next day when we served it.  We didn't follow the fruit list exactly and it still turned out well!

This was delicious!  Very light so you can really taste the fruit.  The sauce is a great compliment with the citrus and vanilla flavors.  I will be making this again for sure.  My only note: It needs to be eaten the same day, we had leftovers overnight in our fridge and the fruit was quite soggy and not appetizing.

I soaked the banana slices in pineapple juice to keep them from turning brown. I didn't have fresh lemons so used bottled juice and halved the amount of lemon zest and used dried. Used watermelon and no pineapple or kiwi. Salad looked as good as it tasted! Best fruit salad I have ever eaten. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was fantastic fruit salad. The sauce was just exactly what I had been looking for, light, sweet and extra tasty. I used pineapple juice along with the orange and lemon juices. I forgot the vanilla so did not get it in at all. I also added a 1/4 tsp of mint just because I love it. Even my husband who is not a big fruit lover enjoyed this and asked for it for dessert the next night. Thank you for posting this.

Made no changes to the recipe.  Ah, I guess I did make one.  I first soaked the bananas in the cooled sauce to keep them from turning brown and then mixed everything together instead of layering.   This will be my go to summer fruit salad from now on.

Although this was good I thought there was a little too much of a vanilla taste and next time I make it I will cut back and add it a little at a time until I find the right amount for our taste.

Sorry, but this just wasn't right . . . followed the recipe exactly, and the "sauce" never did thicken. I kept it anyway, refrigerated it (hoping it would thicken, but it didn't) and tossed it with some seasonal fruits. It was okay, but so not worth the trouble of making the syrup.

I didn't have any bananas or pineapple on hand, so I used red raspberries and blackberries instead. I also used two cans of drained mandarin orange segments in place of the fresh orange. 
Also, taking the advice of some of the other reviewers, I cut the OJ/brown sugar/lemon juice/vanilla in half. My fruit was all very ripe, so I didn't think it would need much sweetening up.
This was perfect and a hit with my BBQ guests.

Besides the unnecessarily sweet, brown sugar syrup concoction ... I see one more big improvement this recipe could benefit from.
I always used to use lemon in my fruit salads and never realized how unpleasantly sour it made the otherwise naturally sweet fruit taste. I knew it needed an acid to prevent the fruit from going bad prematurely, but it wasn't until my discovery of the distinctly Latin  American influence of using limes almost to the exclusion of our  invariable use of lemon for every single purpose (don't get me wrong, I LOVE lemon flavor when used appropriately like in lemon meringue pie, lemon curd, lemon cake/cookies/bars, etc etc.).
But for this recipe the only citrus fruit ever needed to add a distinctively refreshing acidity, w/o the accompanying "sour", are LIMES!  No orange juice, and definitely NO LEMONS!
So go ahead and try it; put down the inevitable lemon, and squeeze a couple of limes with just a touch of plain old granulated sugar and i guarantee you not one of you reading this review will EVER  go back to lemons in your fruit salad again. And your guest will surely notice the subtle "je ne sais quois" fl;avor you imparted to those deliciously ripe and sweet summer fruit you'v epicked up from your local market.

This turned out really good. I didn't have orange or lemon zest and didn't have oranges plus forgot the banana. I think if I had all of these it would have been better. Either way it would/was very good. I will make again. Oh yeah, I did add honey dew melon and that soaked up the sauce and tasted really good.

Normally I don't love fruit salad but this was pretty good. I personally don't LOVE the tartness of it but the sauce helped cut down on that. This would be great paired with some cottage cheese.

This salad was a hit the first time I made it! I modified the sauce by substituting honey for the sugar and it was so delicious.  My husband commented that the sauce at the bottom of the bow would make a great Mai Tai mix!  Will make this again and again"

Did I do something wrong? I found this to be way way way too sweet and detract from the fruits. Not a fan.

I prepared this for a Hawaiian theme sweet 16 party and it was a HIT!!! It looked gorgeous and colorful. I replaced the kiwi for the honey dew and it worked really well. I also eliminated some of the sauce but let it simmer while it was in the refrigerator getting cool. I'll definetely do it again!

Good, but not fabulous, which is just a personal preference.  I don't agree that the longer the salad soaks, the better.  Yes, it needs some time, but strawberries and pineapple lose their juice and become tough and flavorless after about twenty-four hours in sugar.  And bananas?  Not even that long and they aren't good.  This would be a good dish to take to a gathering, altho I thought it was rather expensive to make.  Since I'm cooking for two most of the time, this salad isn't practical for us. I followed this recipe except that I did not use the banana.  My bananas were past their prime and I didn't want to risk ruining the salad with an over-ripe banana.  Again this is a personal preference but I prefer fruit salads with two fruits whose flavors complement each other, with maybe the addition of a few berries or kiwi, over the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink salad...but I'm the same way with tossed green salads, too.  My finance rated this salad a seven.  (But he is a nut for fruits.) (06.12.11; 03.12.17)

Made this for a family picnic.  huge hit.  the sauce is what made the difference.  As many reviews stated, the sauce did not thicken and that is important so you don't have a "pool" of sauce at the bottom of your dish .  To thicken it, I took a small amount of corn starch in a cup, added a little sauce, stirred it so no lumps and then added that to the sauce in the pan and it thickened perfectly.  Did not alter the taste of the sauce at all.  I did not use all of the sauce but just enough to coat the fruit.  We also had to travel 2 hours so I added the sauce just before leaving and that was enough time to absorb the flavor of the sauce in the fruit. I added the bananas and apples just before serving.

YUM!  I was worried about the sauce; it didn't thicken much and was brownish - not too appetizing, right?Perfect sweetness in the sauce, however. Made it at noon for a late dinner party and the fruit kept its color and texture. Maybe it helped that I didn't stir it together until the party?

Unreal. Always wanted to find a fruit salad that used a clear, citrusy-sauce to toss the fruit in. And this is it. 

Did not follow the recipe when it came to the fruits in the salad, since I'm living in Asia and have my own favorite fruits available throughout the year. 

The sauce, though, oh this sauce. The perfect blend of orange, lemon and vanilla - with a hint of sweetness. It brought out the fruit flavor and made it smell heavenly. Will - and already have - recommend it to cooks around the globe.

I didn't layer the fruit as suggested, so perhaps this is why I didn't like it very much.  I didn't really like the flavor of the sauce with the fruit.  But everyone I served it to said they liked it.

This is a very good recipe, although expensive. I read the other reviews and alot of them state that liquid didn't thicken up, so I tried it, and it didn't thicken, so I added a little plain gelatin to the liquid. Thickened right up! I even tried it by adding a little vanilla pudding powder. Worked great and tasted great!

I cheated and used store bought lemonade and orange juice. I added brown sugar and the vanilla and brought to a boil. It never really thickened, but it kept the fruit a nice color and was still very good.

Very easy and great taste.  I used some different fruits in this because I didn't have the strawberries on hand but it didn't effect the over all taste at all.  This is a good one to play with.  I noted that some comments said the sauce didn't thicken well for them, so I reduced it over low heat a bit more knowing the juice from the fruit would thin it out some as it chilled. One thing to note...if you are using vanilla paste you might want to decrease it from one teaspoon to maybe half a teaspoon.

OMG This was SO good! I could live on this stuff.  Didn't change anything, followed directions exactly.  We had it over two summer night meals and still had leftovers that unfortunately had to be tossed because we couldn't eat it all before it started to go bad.  I will definitely be making this a lot over the summer and even during the winter too.  Thanks for posting my new favorite fruit salad.

One of the best fruit salads I have had to date.  Wonderful for summer cook outs or pot lucks.  I sectioned the oranges like a grapefruit because I don't like the white fuzz but used all the other ingredients as listed.  It was very delicious.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this for a Memorial Day picnic and it was a huge hit. I also took along an Amish-baked chocolate cake. The fruit salad was gone in no time flat. The Amish cake, sat there in shame. Lol! I was skeptical about the "sauce" ... but it really married everything nicely and kept everybody in the bowl looking and tasting fresh. 5 stars ... only because I couldn't give it more!

Fantastically fresh and simple.  I left out the grapes and blueberries because there weren't any decent ones at the store.  I did add cubed watermelon after the bananas and some raspberries on top to compensate.  The syrup was light and dressed it up just enough to make it more than just a bowl of fruit but didn't weigh it down at all. 

I actually doubled the recipe for a large family party and served it layered in a "crystal" punch bowl.  It was a beautiful addition to the table.

Very easy & delicious, perfect for potlucks.  The sauce enhanced the fruit, rather than overpower it like some yogurt sauces that are added to fruit.

I was very skeptical about putting a syrup on fruit salad. I like fresh fruit plain and rarely eat sugar, so when I made this I set aside a portion of plain fruit for myself and put the syrup on the rest of the fruit for other people to have. However, dessert time came and when I opened up the container with this fruit salad, the smell of it made my mouth water. I was blown away by the taste too--absolutely addictive! I had been concerned that it would be too sweet--I think fruit is sweet enough as it is--but, thankfully this fruit salad was not too sweet for me. The syrup that the fruit marinades in  cranks the flavor of the fruit up several notches.  It is super important to use fresh orange juice and that the oranges by very flavorful. I think that is what made this salad so good for me. This is my new favorite dessert.

Made it for my daughters graduation party and everyone loved it, it was the first bowl empty. Only change I made was I only used half the sauce and mixed the fruit instead of layering it. Beautiful and delicious.

I made this for a cookout. We had a lot of guests so I trippled the recipe. It was awesome; There was none left after the party. The only think I changed were the oranges. Instead of regular oranges, I used Cuties.

The trick to this recipe is taste, taste, taste! The negative reviews cite too tart or too sweet syrup, which indicates that you need to keep tasting as you cook to adjust. Don't just blindly follow the recipe; some fruits differ in taste, so you could have two oranges and one is sweeter than the other. Sometimes pineapple is more tart. You just have to adjust the sugar to match the fruits and juices you have! I used an orange-tropical fruit juice and added a touch of honey when my syrup was a little too tart, and this turned out wonderfully!

Easier than I thought to prepare and I love the myraid of colors-very visually appealing. I substituted kiwi and mango with cantaloupe and added pomegranate seeds on top. Depending on taste you could even have it with or without the source, might be too much sugar for some people

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and my family LOVED it - after reading the reviews I decided that even though the amount sounded huge, leftovers would be scarce and go fast. So glad I did! I used slightly different fruits and mixed them together (instead of layering), let it sit covered in the fridge for several hours, and it was delicious. If you think fruit is sweet enough on its own this may be too sweet for you. But if you're looking for a crowd-pleasing dessert or to "trick" friends into eating healthy fruits who normally wouldn't, ;) this gets the job done without erasing the flavors of the individual fruits. Five stars.

I was hesitant to try this on our guests for our annual BBQ since I'd never tried it.  I followed the recipe exactly using splenda brown sugar and low sugar OJ.  It was delicious!  Had just enough left over for one serving with breakfast the next day.  I know I will make this many times.

Made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit, everyone loved it!  Looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.  The sauce tasted weird when I first made it, but after putting it together with the fruit and chilling it, it added that special something.

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe using fruits that were fresh and available to me in January -- pineapple, cherries, blueberries, green grapes, bananas, kiwi,  raspberries, tangerines, and apples.   I did use freshly squeezed orange and lemon juices.   I took it to a football party where it was declared a winner.  Thanks for this recipe!  I'm glad I made a copy of it for my files!

I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  We don't lime banana in fruit salads so I swapped it for fresh mango. I didn't have Orange juice in the fridge as I had thought. Had Coconut water with mango and passionfuit so used that in it's place. Also used a high quality vanilla bean paste.
Took it to a pot luck dinner and everyone raved about it ????

Very good - very pretty salad.  But like others - the sauce didn’t thicken and I followed the advice of another who added cornstarch to the sauce. That worked. Thanks for the recipe!

So I was volunteered to bring a fruit bowl to my husband's granddad's 100 birthday. Never made one before. I found this one. So I decided to double the recipe because a lot of people would be there. I followed the directions exactly. The bowl weighed about 20lbs. I was a little irritated thinking I would have a lot to bring home....Not so. The unknown cousin next to us ranted to his wife that it was the best fruit salad he had ever had. He finished it and slurped down the juices. Then went back and got seconds and slurped it down again. My nephew's wife asked me what I had made it with, crack? So... there you have it. It is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I am a new widower who needs to learn more about food and cooking. This recipe attracted me because of its beauty and simplicity. I doubled all ingredients and brought it to a recent family picnic. I expected the amount of brown sugar to result in a sweeter taste but I think it was mitigated by the tartness of the pineapple. Still next time I will cut back the sugar by 25% or so.

This was great!  Made for a brunch that I was having over the weekend.  It was wonderful that I could make it the afternoon before (without the bananas) and just store in the fridge overnight.  I skipped the oranges, as they are a pain to cut into sections.   I also mixed all the fruits together as I thought the pictures of it done that way looked prettier and that it would be easier for everyone to serve themselves at my buffet.  Also added blackberries on top as they looked so beautiful in the photos.  This is a keeper!

Super easy to make!  I only used 1/2 -2/3 of the brown sugar mix.  Seemed to be enough.  It is sweet, but it was also offset by the different flavors of fruit.

I really did not care for this. It was quite a bit of effort for a dressing that was taken over by the vanilla. Upon tasting, I felt the vanilla over the fruit was just an odd combination and not very good. I would have been better just using brown sugar on all that beautiful fruit. I brought it to someone's house along with a quiche I make. I was thanking my lucky stars I didn't show up with this fruit salad or I would have been annoyed. Not anything special and not worth the effort.

I made this for July 4th get-together.  Everyone complimented it.  My husband loved it so I made it again the next day with the extra fruits I had in the refrigerator.  I did dip the banana slices in lemon juice so they wouldn't turn brown and look ugly.  I will make this again, no doubt.  I followed the sauce recipe as written.  I think that it really brought out the flavors in the fruits so don't skip it !

This fruit salad was amazing.   I made the glaze according to the directions minus a bit of the lemon juice.  I didn't have a full 1/3 cup - was about half that but it did not matter.  It was delicious.  I used strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, apples, clementines and bananas.  The glaze was just sweet enough to enhance the fruit.  It was just the right amount of sweetness.   It was beautiful and a huge hit!  Will definitely make again.

Excellent blend of flavors.  I made the salad in January.  Because of the magical syrup, everything tasted as though it had been picked at the height of summer!  After two hours, I noticed my bananas were starting to turn brown.  Is there any fix for this?

Absolutely wonderful. I served it yesterday at my Mama's 85th Birthday Party. I accidentally forgot it in the refrigerator and didn't get to serve it until the party was almost over. The family still ended up eating 75% of it as we hung out and reminisced! Will add to favs and make again.

I made this for a End of Summer Cottage Party! It was such a big hit! Everyone Just loved it.If you follow the Recipe Exactly /I  added a "Drained" a small can of" Tropical Fruit: to the top layer/Be sure not to mix all the fruit up after you layer it.Just pour the sauce over it and cover with Saran Wrap and Foil.(Keeps it very cold). I had a large stainless steel bowl filled with Ice cubes in transport to the Party,I know I will be making this again Thanks All Recipe!So Simple!

Tastes great, but the sauce never did thicken...it just pooled in the bottom of the bowl. The kids still loved it, though. I added blackberries and diced cantaloupe.

Yummy yummy yummy! You have to try it, pronto! It was easy to make, very pretty, and not to mention delicious! Everyone in my family liked it, even if they only ate one particular fruit, they still ate it:) I'm excited to try it with all different fruits. I used frozen orange juice and than thawed it, because I knew if I bought a jug, it would be gone by the time I got to it. I didn't have 3 hours(just about 30 minutes) to chill, but it was still fabulous.
You  need to try it!

I made this for a girls' night in BBQ and it was totally devoured. Everyone raved about it.  The sauce is what makes this soooo great!  I did not change a thing except to add the bananas right before it was served(I don't like soggy bananas!).  I will definitely make this for summer BBQ's in the future.

I made this for a Fathers' Day family celebration and it was a big hit! I loved that I could dress it in the morning and at dinner it tasted as though I just cut and served fresh fruit. This is my new "go to" fruit salad. Thank you!

A PERFECT summer salad...I wish I'd made a double-batch, it went so quickly at our graduation luncheon. We also made some pretty little kiddie cocktails, putting a little bit of the fruit in the bottom of a glass and topping it with lemonade and a bit of lemon lime soda. YUM!

I made this salad for a get together with my girlfriends and they loved it. One of my girlfriends even drank the juice after she was done with the fruit. We did not find the syrup to be too sweet, it was just right and even better the next day!

It was delicious, and the syrup did thicken for me.  But as the dish was eaten and as it sat a bit, it seemed to have too much liquid at the bottom, almost turning into fruit soup towards the end of the party.  I guess next time I will drain it a bit after about 1/2 of the fruit is gone.

Took this to a party and it was a hit!  Not too sweet and it doesn't take away from the taste of the fruit. It also kept the bananas and apples from going brown.  Thanks for the great recipe

I made this for Christmas starter for a change.  It was delicious, lots left over because there are only two adults and two kids but next day it was not too bad but instead, I threw it in the nutri bullet to serve smoothies, just added yoghurt and they were delicious.  Would recommend this recipe and what to do with left overs to everyone!

I was looking for a good sauce for a fruit salad and made it as instructed in this recipe.  Although I used the fruit I had on hand instead of those listed in this recipe, the citrus sauce complimented it wonderfully.  Not too sweet, not too tangy.  Thank you for the recipe.

It was sweet and not unpleasant, but disguised almost completely the real taste of the fruit. I was looking for something to bring out the fruit flavor, but this was way too strong in my opinion.

used 1/2 of the orange juice/lemon juice mix on the fruit with strawberries, blue berries, apricots, nectarines, cantalope, and watermelon - was going to add apples and bananas, ran out of time, still tasted awesome!

People liked seeing the layers of fruit through the glass bowl on the buffet.  Savory presentation.  Everybody enjoyed some.  It was simple to make in the layers too.  I cut most of the fruit right into the bowl.  I added a layer of pears as there were some nice ripe ones at the store.  Replaced 1/3 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup raspberry preserves and added zest of a lime with its juice.  It is an easily adjustable recipe.  I made sure the added layer contrasted well with the layers above and below.

This was the most amazing, easy, and delicious fruit salad ever! This recipe is 100% perfect as is. After chilling a few hours, make sure you serve any sauce that gathered on the bottom of the bowl on your fruit. Have you ever got a sweet tooth and reached for a cookie because fruit doesn’t seem to cut it? Not with this recipe! It was the perfect and balanced blend of fruit with a “candied” taste. Super nutritious as well…5 stars!

I deleted the brown sugar and vanilla and added a heaping teaspoon of honey to the liquid instead. Tasted it several times along the way to see if it was sweet enough, and decided to use two packets of Splenda instead. It feeds at least 10 people and everyone liked it.

Big hit at luncheon.  Added some other fruits and didn't use orange slices.  Cooked sauce 2x as long and still very runny, may cook longer next time.

I made this fruit salad for our 17 senior football players during our senior supper night. I expected to have left over's but it was all gone. The sauce gave the salad just the right amount of sweetness without it tasting like it had anything on it. The sauce did not thicken but I didn't really think it would because of the ingredients used. I followed the recipe exactly and will be using it again. I made my salad 12 hours before the event and next time I will try to make it 3-4 hours prior so that the sauce doesn't get too juicy with the sauce/fruit. GREAT tasting salad but is was a little costly to make.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I gave it a 5 star because it deserves one. I made a couple mistakes so it wasn’t a 5 star but only a 4 because of my mistakes. First I made it the night before. I layered all the fruit and I should not have put in the bananas because they weren’t as fresh as they should have been. Second, I forgot the vanilla so I decided to just put the vanilla in and stir it up in hopes it mixed with the sauce. So I had to stir it the night before which didn’t help my bananas or kiwi which started to fall apart. Third, my fruit was not ripe enough or in season so we all know there taste was not up to par. I will definitely make this again and again! I will remember my mistakes and correct those. If I have to cut up the fruit again the night before, I will put each fruit in a plastic bag and not cut my bananas. I will also make my slices a little thicker. I might also use tangerines instead of oranges. My oranges came from California but I didn’t like how thick the rinds where and the taste was off. I think my salad will be perfect next time. Thank you for such a clean food salad!

I left out the kiwis and used fewer blueberries because I use organic whenever possible and they were a bit expensive.  The sauce was great - just the right amount of sweet and tangy from the zest.  My family loved it for dessert.

It was a big hit with my fellow Associates. The only thing is the amount is small so I will double up on everything the next time. I also let it sit in the sauce over night flipping the bowl a couple of times to ensure all fruits were coded. Thank you for sharing!

My first reaction was... why do I need a recipe to cut up fruit in a bowl?  Then I saw the “dressing” and gave it a try.  It’s not bad. Sometimes you try to pick out the sweet fruit and there is a stinker in the bunch that just is not sweet.  The dressing would help that.  I was fortunate to get a great batch of fruit and berries.  The dressing seemed to take away from the individual flavors.  Each  piece tasted the same.  Good for off season but a good summer bowl of fruit is yummy without the added sugar and vanilla.  IMHO

Did not care for this at all.  The fruit was better before the sauce. It had a tart taste that seemed to sour the fruit.  It never gets thick nothing in the ingredients to thicken it.  Would not make again.

I made this for a family celebration and was a bit nervous about using the "sauce" thinking it would be way too sweet. I used it anyway and, instead of layering the fruit, mixed it all up. It was a HUGE hit and (much to my dismay) there was nothing left from the double recipe I made.  This will definitely play a role in future get togethers.

Quadrupled the recipe to feed a large group.  Yes, 4 times the amounts listed.  Cannot believe the responses from guests.  All but a small amount in the bottom of the bowl was left.  I have since made it again just for the family.  I actually doubled the amount of dressing.  Worked out perfectly because we spooned the fruit mixture over dessert cakes and added whipped cream.  Yum!

I used the best available fruit-including watermelon. I don't like the texture of bananas in fruit salad so I skipped it. I think any combination of fruit would work. I also only used 1 TBS of sugar in the raw  and the juice of one lemon. I didn't want to use that much sugar, but also didn't want it to be too tart. My salad received great reviews. I think adding 1/3 a cup of sugar to a fruit salad would make it taste like a pie filling.

Made almost exactly as written, except I only used one orange, not two.   I didn't have the time to let it set for more than a couple of hours, but it was still really good.  Definitely on the sweeter side, so if you prefer your fruit more in their natural state, you could probably half the amount of sugar and it would still be good.  I ended up with quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the bowl since the fruit created extra juices on top of the syrup you pour over it.    Got lots of compliments from my family on this one.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a family Mother's day brunch.  I have to confess that I doubled the sugar as the fruit I had was not very sweet.  The sauce never thickened but the salad was delicious and no left overs.  Next time I will add some gelatin or cornstarch to the sauce.

OJ, lemon juice and zest worked well, but brown sugar made it way too sweet.  Vanilla was a good addition, but I'd cut back to 1/2 tsp.

The sauce you pour over the fruit made the salad! I used pineapple, kiwi, blueberries, blackberries, fresh tangerines and grapes. I only had one orange so I juiced that and adjusted the lemon juice, sugar and vanilla to taste. Will definitely make this sauce again - it’s easy and a little goes a long way. Brings all the fruit flavors together. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Served this to a party crowd and heard MULTIPLE times, "Is there something on the fruit?"  i.e. This fruit salad is delicious, and the sauce is subtle enough to almost not be there.  But... thankfully it is, so the sauce can protect the bananas from browning & make this a make-ahead dish perfect for parties.

This fruit salad is amazing!  I love that it doesn’t have a ooey, gooey, sweet sauce, it tastes very fresh!  You can substitute or add different fruits.  My family loves it!

I made this for the rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding and it was delicious. The only change I made was to omit the bananas because I felt they would get mushy quickly. One warning: I used the feature on this site where you can adjust the number of people you are feeding and it wasn't accurate. I adjusted the number of servings to 50, which was the number at the dinner, and it could have easily fed 100. I had a ton of salad left. Luckily I took it to the wedding the next day and added it to the buffet supper and it got eaten.  I was especially  glad I hadn't added the bananas because the salad was a little mushy as it was on the second day. This will not hold over more than a day, but it is very, very tasty.

Packed this in the cooler to have as a healthy snack on a long trip. Left out the bananas because I was afraid they would get mushy. The salad held up well and everyone agreed it was delicious!!! I will definitely make this again.

For my grandson"s going away gathering  i made this salad and again, two weeks later for another family gathering - it was a success.  People liked that it was fresh fruit and especially without mayo, cream cheese or sour cream.  First time i made it, i bought extra oranges to use for the "fresh" oj;  the second time i used bottled oj.  So i recommend going the fresh squeezed method.  It does taste even better this way.  This is a keeper!

Yum!! Made this twice now. Leftovers are great in the a.m. with some yogurt, or a side with lunch. Both times, it's all gone the second day. And I add blackberries. So good!

Beautiful and delicious! I made this for a “Very Hungry Caterpillar” themed birthday party and it wasn’t a hit! I only added about 2/3 the sauce (it started pooling at the bottom) and didn’t add zest.

It was perfect as it is. Took it to a get- together.  Many of the geusts were gluten lactose and egg intolerant. So the fruit salad was a hit.

This is a great fruit salad, but I'm giving it only 2 stars because it grossly underestimates the prep time needed.  It took me just under an hour to prep this salad.  Unless you're a professional or have amazing knife skills, there's no way you're washing, peeling, prepping and cutting up all this fruit in 25 minutes.

Simple and delicious.  Use any combination of fruits you prefer.   I used strawberries, red raspberries, black raspberries, blueberries, and green grapes.   It looks beautiful in any clear glass bowl.  Good for breakfast, brunch, as a salad or dessert.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will make it again and again. (We could not wait several hours to eat it, and it tasted wonderful after only an hour.

Delicious, nutritious and beautiful! I made this for an Independence Day family gathering and it was a huge success. I forgot to add the vanilla to the sauce but it still tasted great. I used fresh cherries instead of grapes and layered everything in a trifle bowl. It was a very impressive sight! My two-year-old granddaughter ate three bowls of this at the gathering and two more bowls of it the next day. Kid-tested; mother-and-grandmother-approved.

I thought this was very good. Made this for father's day. I didn't use the zest or the grapes and subbed limes for the lemons because that is what i had. Drizzled some of the sauce (didn't use it all makes a lot) over the fruit right before we ate and it was wonderful.  My husband said I could make this anytime. =)

I made this fruit salad for a summer lunch -- it was delicious and disappeared quickly! I took the advice of some other reviewers and reduced the vanilla extract by half -- there was plenty of vanilla flavor so I would recommend making that change.

This salad was great for a party, in fact it was the first thing that was gone, this recipe makes plenty for at least 10-15 people. I had many people ask for the recipe so will definitely use it again. It was perfect, no changes needed!

This salad is bomb, except the strawberries do not stay delicious for very long.   I made to keep in fridge for a summer yummy during the week while kids are home, and it was bomb except for the strawberries turning icky within 24 hrs.  Everything else was bomb.   Even the bananas stayed decent.

Showstopping and delicious!  I substituted local honey in place of the sugar.  I made this the evening before, adding the bananas immediately before serving.  The marinade remaining in the bottom of the bowl makes incredible mimosas or freeze in an ice cube tray to use in summer cocktails.  Will definitely add this to my list of summer recipes.

I would definitely make this again.  The only differences that were done to the recipe was I added watermelon and omitted the kiwi. Everything else was pretty much to the book & enjoyed by all.

This was a definite hit with the crowd!  I've now been designated as the official fruit salad provider.  I changed which fruit was used depending on what looked best and what was on sale, otherwise, stayed pretty close to the recipe except that I used about 1/3 less sugar.

I did like this recipe. The next time I make it, I will decrease the amount of fresh lemon juice. It was a bit too bitter for me.

Fantastic fruit salad recipe!  My family loved it, and I didn't feel the need to make any changes to the recipe; it all works perfectly together, both in flavour and in presentation (t's a very "pretty" salad).  I served it with a pound cake and whip cream for dessert - tasted great!

No bananas but added significantly more fruit to each layer as my glass bowl is pretty large.  Didn't need to increase the "dressing" - there was plenty.

It is March and where I live it is cold & snowy and I am craving fruit! I was looking for some recipes to make with fruit and came across this one. I made this one evening and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Let me just say this is the BEST fruit salad I have ever made. The sauce that is made and poured over the fruit makes this a side dish to remember. Because I doubled the fruit to make a larger salad the sauce recipe was perfect and I did not increase the sauce, I made as stated so with that said, doubling the fruit is a perfect match for the “original” sauce ingredients.  I made a huge bowl and when I served it with dinner the next evening, there was very little left. Everyone loved it and if it was this delicious in the wintertime, my oh my I cant wait to make it during BBQ season. This is a recipe keeper for sure!!!!!

Delicious. Made it for a party. I was having sandwiches and pizza as the main meal. So I wanted a refreshing side so it wasn’t just  in our bodies. This did the trick. So simple yet the sauce gave it that little kick needed. I didn’t layer it and just mixed it all together. I also made it the night before the party and just added the bananas a few hours before and sauce. As a previous reviewer did. Perfect!

I couldn't be more pleased!  I cut up the fruit the night before and added the syrup.  I added bananas in the morning.  It adds a "hint" of sweetness which is sometimes needed this time of year.  I did drain some of the liquid before serving it.

I made it the night before as I needed it for a 9 am brunch.
Added the banana around 6 am.  
I think the time overnight made it a little mushy, would be better if used the same day.

I left out the bananas because I felt they would get mushy in the salad since it had to sit in my refrigerator overnight.  It takes a long time to make this salad.  My feet were killing me when it was finally done.  Haha.  Loved the sauce that is poured over the salad.  I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular brown sugar.

The fruit salad was easy to make, and was the highlight of my luncheon meeting. I prepared the salad 4 hours prior to my serving time.  This perfect fruit salad was definitely perfect--it was not only beautiful to look at, but the taste was amazing.  The only change I made was that I used red seedless grapes, not the green ones shown in the photo.  The fruit was light and refreshing; my guests went back for seconds and thirds.  I will make it ago for a backyard barbecue later this month.

4 stars instead of 5 due to just a bit too sweet for my taste. 
Next time I'll delete the brown sugar.  If doesn't work, I'll delete the sugar.  It's trial and error.  I loved the choice of fruits and simplicity of the salad.

I did add a peach to this since I had some very ripe ones.  I made the sauce and cut the fruit (except for the banana) the day before. I threw it all together with the banana several hours before serving.  Garnished with some fresh mint. A huge hit!! (Cut everything in half as we were only 4. Still had a little left over.)

I made it exactly as written. It was very expensive and time consuming to make. Would have been better without the oranges as they took a long time to peel and the membrane on them hid the seeds.  Might have been better with mandarin oranges.. Sauce never did thicken. No reason to layer it , anyone wanting the pineapple or strawberries had to dig to the bottom which mixed it all up.

I agree with "Chook", no need for the extra sweeteners & vanilla. Fruit is suppose to taste like fruit.
A can of mandarin orange would be a nice addition.
Basically, take any & all fresh (or canned) fruit you have on hand & throw it together.
(apples & bananas need to be coated in a little lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown)
If you have them, throw in a jar of Maraschino cherries, watermelon, cantaloupe honeydew melon, grapefruit ... ... possibilities are endless !!!
A little chopped celery will add a nice alter-flavor & crunch.
I did want to mention the posted recipe calls for blueberries, but the posted image shows blackberries. (OH... throw in some blackberries)

PS: a lite sprinkle of salt will bring out the natural juices in all the fruit.

I added additional  fruits like raspberries but you need to add them last as they get mushy with too much stirring and cut up most of the fruit the night before and added the bananas before serving. This was awesome.   I couldn't stop eating it and everyone loved it. Best fruit salad and will make again.   Also stirred it up as it gave a better appearance. Didn't have a zester so chopped up the lemon and orange zest real fine with grater and still worked great.

All that sugar turns the fruit to poison.  The fruit doesn't need the syrup. The fruit will cease to be healthy with the sugar.

The dressing is overpowering in its "citrusiness".  I used less than half of what was suggested, but still found it too strong for the flavors of the other fruit.

This was excellent, BUT, it's not pictured as recipe. The picture has blackberries (which I added) and rasberries. It only called for blueberries, and they tend to overpower things in my world so stuck with the picture/ recipe. I liked the citrus flavor. Takes some time to make, but very much worth the work.

I've made this a couple times to take to parties and potlucks and it has been a hit. The dressing is light and delicious and the variety of fruit makes it appealing to the eye and very tasty. I do not layer the fruit, I just mix everything together and it has turned out wonderfully.

My family absolutely loved this salad and so did I.  I made it for 12 and it took a very long time to prepare.  I would recommend making the dressing ahead and refrigerating it for this size crowd.  I will definitely make this again,  but probably not for 12.

I made this recipe X 6 for a summer graduation party.  The only changes were to substitute a gallon of cubed pineapple for the fresh to save on cost and not take chances with un-ripened pineapple.  My kiwi weren't ripe enough even after a night in a paper bag so I omitted them, but I would add when I make it again.  The salad was plenty sweet, I will cut back on brown sugar.  It's okay that it was so juicy, we served in clear plastic cups and filled with a slotted spoon.  The leftovers make FANTASTIC SMOOTHIES!  I might even consider making a large batch just to freeze into cups when fruit is on sale.  Just add ice in the blender.  We got lots of compliments!  I use allrecipes.com for many dishes.  I like to read the reviews for suggestions and ratings.

I made this as the recipe said except for the brown sugar, which I did not add.  I saw no need to add sugar , when the fruit was wonderful on its own.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it had not called for sliced bananas.  After a short time in the refrigerator, they turned to slime and looked terrible.  I spent a lot of time picking these unsightly pieces out of the salad.  Otherwise the salad was very good.

The title of this fruit salad is right on.  It is PERFECT.  I used 4 halos (clementines) for the orange sections because they are smaller sections.  It was a hit at our cookout.

Delicious, used 1 can of mandarin oranges in place of the others.  Beautiful all mixed together, let sit for 3 or 4 hours before serving if you can.  Could possibly have made 1/2 the recipe of dressing.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and it was a great hit. I did not use pineapple, and added blackberries, but I think  the dressing makes this dish.

I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe to the T and the sauce did not thicken and was very tart. My fruit looked beautiful but after adding the sauce my fruit looked sad. and my raspberries turned to mush. I tasted it after several hours and it was so tart I had to add a little sugar. In the end it was all gone at the potluck so I guess it passed with the sugar addition.

I always make a new recipe exactly as written the 1st time, to determine if I want to make any changes. This was perfect as is. I liked the dressing on it so much that as the amount of fruit went lessened, I added more. Very good, in my "favorites" to stay!

Made this a couple weekends ago and it went over really well. I was nervous because when I went to the store I couldn't find blueberries and no fresh pineapple, so I opt'd for canned pineapple and used mango. Overall, it smelled and tasted really good, but was pretty wet and soggy due to the canned pineapple and the sauce, but it was flavorful.

It was a lovely salad, but it just wasn't quite sweet enough. I think perhaps some whipped cream on top would have helped. Perhaps my berries were a bit tart. I did use organic fresh blackberries from the farmers market but everything else was as recipe called for.

Delish!!  I  have made this three times and use varying ways of sweetening the citrus syrup.  First time as directed, second time with honey and third time with coconut sugar.  I think I liked the coconut sugar the best.  I also played around with different fruits  The first time I did everything as directed.  Second time I left out the kiwi (on purpose cuz I found I don't like kiwi) and pineapple (by accident).  Still a marvelous salad.  The third time I added nectarines and still left out kiwi. Just overall a really good salad.  I think next time I'll sprinkle in a little raw coconut flakes.  Gorgeous salad!

Made this today. Made a few minor changes based on availability of fruit. Oranges not in season, so bought 1 for peel, and some juice, but used fresh orange juice in a bottle for rest of needed juice. Added fresh cantaloupe instead. Doubled sauce since we doubled the recipe, but used about 1/2 of it in salad. It is marinating now, to serve in about 3 hours, but all taste testers agreed it tasted phenomenal. Can't wait to take it to a birthday celebration later today and actually have some. We expect 30 adults at the party today, and doubling the recipe seems like more than enough. Thanks for the recipe.

WONDERFUL!
Followed recipe as written except, as others did, I made the fruit the day before and added the bananas prior to serving.  The brown sugar and vanilla makes this fruit salad exceptional and memorable.

I didn't care for it. The fruit didn't need anything added.

A nice fresh fruit salad. Of course you can substitute some fruit based on what you have/what's on sale. Anybody can cut up fruit and throw it together. I'm giving it 5 stars because of the glaze that holds it all together. I left out the vanilla.

Great taste. Mine wasn't as pretty as in the picture. When I went to stir the fruit it mushed but we all loved it anyway.

Only changes made was in types of fruit  and amounts.  Used 3 cups  each of strawberries, green  grapes, blueberries, and 3 oranges halved.

Sauce was excellent, it was a crow pleaser.  Will do again.

Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out great. It was easy to prepare and the fruit flavors mix well but we're still distinctive. I will definitely make it again.

I didn't change a thing.  This is the bomb of fruit  salads.  Made it for son-in-law's birthday not a bit left.
Will make again and again and again.

I did carefully follow the recipe but the lemon made it rather tart. Have to be careful with lemons as some can be more tart. The sauce did not thicken so perhaps some cornstarch should be added for next time. Thank you.

I made the sauce as written but varied the fruit a little.  I think the vanilla threw it all off and that we would have liked it otherwise.  I usually prefer just plain fruit salad but was looking for that little extra flavor since the fruit wasn't in season and a little bland and tart on its own.  This unfortunately did not cut it for us.

They will serve this in heaven! I have brought this several times to parties and there is never anything left. It displays nicely in a round glass bowl. I sometimes swap out fruit that is in season for fruit that is out of season but man, props to the creator!

OMG! This fruit salad will become a Summer weekly staple.  Clear and concise from start to placing that last spoonful in your mouth.  Love and totally rate this 'Perfect Summer Fruit Salad' - the name says it all.
