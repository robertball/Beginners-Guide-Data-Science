This is amazing! I have to admit, I didn't have escarole so I used spring mix and fresh spinach. Also subbed sherry cooking wine for sherry vinegar, because I had it on hand. Soooo good!

Loved it, but all escarole was a bit much.  I did 1/2 spring mix.  Toasted pecans worked too.  Great summer salad, and beautiful!

Used curly endive (fris√©e) since store was out of escarole.  Liking the use of different greens for salads, getting tired of spring mix and romaine.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand, so substituted a high quality balsamic. But it was such a great recipe I may hunt down some sherry vinegar so I can try it exactly as written. The fresh peaches + tangy escarole are a remarkable pairing!

Simple and amazing; paired it with the Maple Salmon recipe and had one delicious meal. I did have to substitue balsamic for sherry vinegar, but I don't know if anyone would ever know the difference. Also, I doubled the peaches and goat cheese only because the peaches were in season and perfect.

The key to this recipe is great peaches. I used power greens instead of escarole and more nuts and cheese because green can be bitter. I toasted a variety of unsalted nite from

Yum, yum, yum. The salad was great. The dressing was great. I will be eating this for dinner twice a month for the foreseeable future. I had boursin cheese (garlic and herb) on hand and used that instead of plain goat cheese...very nice. I served a leftover bit of pork chop on the side, which loves peach so all good. Thanks for another great recipe!

Unfortunately I had to substitute quite a bit, lacking the right ingredients. My kids said, that's ok, it's inspired. I call it forgiving and delicious.

Wasn't sure about an educator salad....it was,amazing!!! Just the right combination of flavor, and loved the heavier salad .  It's like a meal in itself.

Forget all those substitutions - this is incredible as is! I've never been a fan of escarole, but after my first bit of this salad, I wanted to stick my whole face in the bowl and graze like a cow. DEEE-licious!

Didn't have the sherry vinegar - so substituted Bordeau Cherry Balsamic Vinegar.  Didn't have peaches, so substituted strawberries.  Delicious!
