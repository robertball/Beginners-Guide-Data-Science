I doubled this recipe. I did not have coconut water, I used equal amounts coconut milk. I also used honey instead of agave nectar. Very good--my kids and I really enjoyed it.

I only used kiwi & pineapple (only because I’m tired of bananas in mostly every smoothie) & it is delicious!

Pretty good.  Didn’t use the coconut water — just the juice from the pineapple chunks.  Didn’t add the agave & it was plenty sweet.

Pretty tasty. I used half of a an orange, not orange juice. And I also substituted almond milk for coconut water.
