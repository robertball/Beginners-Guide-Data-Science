These were wonderful!  The second time I made them, I did them in a crockpot and left them on low all day and removed the cover about half an hour before serving so they thickened up.

This was a smash at my bar-b-que birthday party Sunday!  I made the following changes:  used 1 can butter beans instead of the garbonzos, decreased the molasses to two tablespoons and increased the brown sugar to 2/3 cup, used about two heaping tablespoons of BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup, and did not drain the beans.  I just did a quick saute of the pepper bacon.  I mixed everything in the crockpot and cooked 6 hours low, last two hours high (lid removed) to thicken this and meld the flavors.  Thanks previous reviewers, and thanks Kelly!

I used to have a great recipe for baked beans, but somehow I lost it many years ago... I've tried lots of recipes since then, and this is the closest I've come to that excellent recipe.  It has the perfect combination of ketchup, molasses, mustard, brown sugar and onion.  I'd cut the amt. of  Worchestershire down the next time I made it, though.  But it's good, and you can use any combination of beans you like.  (I used a can of butter beans.)

I made these baked beans for a family BBQ last weekend and everyone commented about how delicious they were.   They really were the best baked beans I've ever had. 

I cooked them covered for an hour as directed,  but then cooked them uncovered for about 10 minutes so they would thicken up and they turned out very well, not too much liquid.  

My store didn't have canned Great Northern Beans, and I don't care for Garbanzo Beans,  so I used two cans of Pinto beans, two cans of Bush's Original Baked Beans, and one can of kidney beans,  plus I used a really good, thick Applewood Smoked Bacon which added a great flavor and texture.

I  loved how simple this was to make!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I cooked this up for a party yesterday exactly as given. No changes. It came out perfect. I was asked by many for the recipe. One lady simply hollered "Ouch, them's goooood beans."
I doubled the recipe to feed 20. Only about 15 ate and the beans ran out early. I'm not a big baked bean fan, but this I loved. I highly recommend. It WILL be a hit.

This bean recipe is awesome!  I live in Vermont, so I add about a half cup of VT Maple syrup, and my husband adds about 1/3 cup of Jack Daniels to the recipe...and it gives them even more zip!  Thanks for the recipe!!

As with most bean-based recipes you can sub just about any type of canned bean for any other and that's what I did... used what was on hand, subbing black beans for garbanzos. I served this as part of a end-of-Summer cookout and added 1 lb. of ground beef to it just to make things interesting. ;-) It even ended up in the oven for much longer than I wanted it to. (Do guests ever show up on time?!?) Would definitely make it again as it was a hit at the cookout!

One thing that was left out if you use canned beans, you should not only drain them but give a quick rinse to wash out all the sodium.  If you will read the cans of beans the sodium is enough for about 4 days of salt.  Better to add a little back and rinse the beans so you have control of the salt factor.  Other good recipe.

WOW! I made this recipe for 100 people - it's so easy - and, as my husband said, there wasn't ONE BEAN left. I didn't have garbanzos so used black beans instead.  I don't think it matters. Going to a potluck tomorrow night and I was instructed that I MUST bring my 'world famous' beans. Thanks for this recipe.  Added 1/29/2010 - Still love this recipe and fall back on it often, especially for groups. I've started adding ground allspice and Tabasco to taste - those two things really punch it up and make a great recipe even better.  8/29/19 still one of hub's favorites. We're eating plant based now so we skip the bacon but add liquid smoke hickory flavor and it's still delicious.

I made this recipe for a family get together and it was delicious!!! I've tried several other baked bean recipes and this was the best, hands down.  I love the variety of beans in it.  You can pretty much use whatever kind you like.  The flavor was great.  I followed the recipe exactly as I do not like to rate a recipe I have altered, like so many do.  You will not be disappointed if you make these !

Can't stop eating these beans!  I've made them twice in the last month to rave reviews!
We're attempting the "Zone Diet" and these beans are a good choice!  Thanks!

It couldn't have been easier.  I liked that there was different types of beans.  I had some ground turkey meat which I substituted for the bacon.  That was great!!  Was perfect for a big bbq crowd.

This is an old Better Homes and Gardens recipe, that I have made for years now. Everyone loves them and I am always asked to bring them back. I use a Crock Pot, it takes about 4 hours on high or all day on low. Plus when I am at a party I can keep them on warm in the Crock Pot and not crowd the cook. Sometime I change the beans to what I have on hand. I like butter beans in mine and at times leave out the garbanzo beans for my father-in-law. I have also added on occasion some ground beef with the bacon. Yummy!!! It always comes out great.

I have now made this recipe 4 times. I follow it exactly. Everyone loves it, no exceptions. I cut up the bacon before frying, it makes it a little easier. I put it all in the ole crock pot and cook it the day before I am going to serve it, that way the flavors all melt together and it thickens up.   I am writing this because when I check allrecipies I look for items with 5 stars and lots of reviews, so it is kinda my way to give back, even though I am saying the same thing hundreds of others have said.  With that, you and your friends and family will love, love, love this.

Fantastic recipe, great flavor.  I used all dried beans instead of canned and omitted garbanzo beans.  If you use dried beans soak them overnight and cook the next morning as directed.  It turned out great!

Tasty!  Ideally I'd love to find a baked bean recipe that doesn't actually include a can of baked beans, but until then, this one is good.  If I made it again I'd add some Tabasco or cayenne to counter the sweet a bit (since they are really sweet).  I swapped half the molasses for maple syrup (perhaps the source of the extra sweetness?) and next time will try it as written, just to compare.  Cooked the bacon, sauteed the onions and garlic and then dumped everything in the slow cooker for 7 hours on low - the consistency was perfect.  I find the garbanzo controversy in these reviews a bit odd - after all that cooking time, pretty much everything has the same flavor and texture, so it doesn't seem to matter which beans you use!

I used dried beans (soaked overnight and cooked about four hours) which ended up a little "al dente", but the flavor of these beans really was the best I have tasted in a while!  If you plan on using dried beans, I would start them the night before you plan on serving them.  I'll be making these again!

Awesome! - I modified it slightly to make it spicier. I offered to bring baked beans to a party with a soul food menu. I had never made my own before. These are REALLY GOOD! Also an impressive take along dish for large groups that is economical. 
Changes:
1. I only used 2 types of Beans - 1/2 Bush's Original baked and 1/2 navy beans. (My corner supermarket had the giant cans for ~ $5.00) 
2. I used Open Pit Original BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup.
3. I added chopped Jalapenos - out of the jar the 1st time and fresh jalapenos the second time - both worked well
4. I browned the onions and garlic instead of cooking just until the onion was tender
5.  I baked with a lower heat for a longer time; not sure if that really made a difference.

Thx Pat and Kelly!

Best baked beans ever. I swapped the garbanzo beans for another can of pinto beans, but the rest was as written. Took them to a 4th of July party and got raves. Thank you for this great recipe!

A very belated thank you! I have been meaning to rate this FOREVER!! I found this recipe about 3-4 years ago and have been making it ever since. It is the only baked bean I make! I am in charge of making it every 4th of July now and that is for about 100 people. They all go nuts over them. I am kind of tired or being the bean lady for 100 people, but I keep doing it...lol. I cannot brag enough about your recipe. Even our friends children who super picky love them. Great recipe and thank you so much fo sharing. They are super flavoful and tasty. DONT HESITATE. Try this recipe. You will not regret it...unless you have to start making it all the time like me..hehe

Hubby and I had my parents over last night for burgers, beans and a movie. Very causal. I made these beans based on the reviews and made them just as recipe was stated (but used butter beans in place of garbanzos). WOW! The flavors were complex, not too sweet, and had a great balance. I loved the change of having a different texture by using different kinds of beans. My Dad went back for 3 helpings, hubby had two and my Mom ate 1 serving and she doesn't even like baked beans. I would definitely make this again and would follow the recipe as I did last night. Super easy but oh, so tasty, too! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made in crockpot on Labor Day 2010 exactly according to recipe but exchanged Pinto Bean for Cannellini/White Kidney Beans as that is what I had.  Cooked on slow for 7 hours; took lid off cooked additional hour.  EXCELLENT!  (Worchester sauce may seemed strong when simmering but cooked out with WONDERFUL flavor...Don't change a thing!)

These beans are about the best I've had.  I have made them a few times and I now get frequent requests.  I leave out the garbanzos, no one in my family likes them.  These are best made a day or 2 ahead.

If you do not LOVE molasses, you will not like this.  I had hoped the flavors would develop better, but it just tasted like beans in molasses.  The chickpeas had a strange flavor in there too.  I was surprised by all the good reviews.  NExt time, I'll stick to my own recipe that uses onions, green pepper, brown sugar, ketchup and bacon.  Sorry, Pat, I don't mean to sound mean :(

Took these beans on our latest camping trip. Everyone absolutely loved them. I'll be making these for years to come. I left out the red kidneys and the garbanzos and doubled the pintos and great northerns. Also, used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and spicy mustard, just what I happened to have on hand. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

These were a hit today. My husband forgot to buy the bacon so I used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage that I had. When I was frying it up there didn't seem to be any fat, so I added the chopped onion and garlic to that. I didn't want huge pieces so when cooked, I dumped on my cutting board and took 30 seconds to use my hand food chopper to finely chop up the mixture, and added that to the bean mix. We also used Navy instead of Garbanzo, everything else I used the same, and also shook in just a couple dashes of tabasco to counter the sugar. bravo! A keeper-- you please my husband and that goes a long way in my book! Merry Christmas!

I love this recipe.  however, there are two changes I made the FIFTH time I made this:  I added some Kansas City style barbeque sauce (1/4 cup or so) to add a bit of a kick.  Also, instead of just 6 bacon slices, I used bacon ends and pieces which I do not crisp.  I add it raw and let it cook for an hour in the oven so it is fully cooked.

This is a 5 star recipe! You can follow it to the "t" and have delicious beans. Sometimes I use northern beans or i just double up on the regular baked beans. You can double up on any beans if you don't like a certain bean. I also used 1/4 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce, less molasses, more brown sugar, less mustard, and a few shakes of cayenne pepper.

I assembled this recipe the night before a large family gathering and refrigerated it overnight.  The next morning I put it in the Crock Pot and cooked it on low for 8 hours - so easy.  Although I was tempted to substitute something for the molasses, I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using black beans in place of the garbanzo beans.  They turned out delicious!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Kick this very good recipe up a notch by browning up 1/2 pound of ground beef with the bacon (which I cut up into 1-inch pieces before frying).

Fabulous.  I made four double recipes in four crockpots (both 5 and 6 quart) for a large party and they all turned out terrific.  I subbed black beans for the garbanzo beans and had only enough for half the molasses amount for each recipe.  I started them 7 hours before serving time, taking the lid off the last hour and a half.  The different bean colors made a terrific presentation.  Thank you.  Will use again.

What a delicious and beautiful baked bean dish! I used black beans instead of garbanzo. Drained all beans first. It's a little soupy when it comes out of the oven but it thickens up nicely as it cools. I received many compliments at a picnic for this dish - and it was the only side dish that completely disappeared (and I had doubled the recipe). Thanks so much Kelly!

Wonderful.  I've been looking for a good baked bean recipe and this is definitely a keeper.  I did change the recipe slightly.  I added 1 T. balsamic vinegar, 1 t. oregano.  I also used 1/4 c. of molasses instead of 1/2 as we prefer baked beans that are not too sweet.

A couple things. I didn't have molasses or Worcestershire Sauce, so I used pure maple syrup and soy sauce instead. Soooo flavorful!! Everyone loved them and I got a lot of complements.
Also, I cooked the bacon, put everything in the slow cooker for about 8 hours and kept it on warm until we were ready to eat, and it was perfect.

These were delicious. I did 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 molasses, left out one can of beans, and replaced the garbanzo beans with black beans. I took them to a bbq and everyone raved about them.

Excellent flavor and consistency.  They taste even better the next day!  I did not enjoy the garbanzo beans that much and will replace them with another bean next time.

This is a YUMMY baked beans recipe! My father-in-law, who loves baked beans and is a baked beans guru, LOVED them. Based on other suggestions, I omitted the garbanzo beans and I also omitted the northern beans and just added more kidney and baked. I also cooked the bacon in the microwave (I don't like to cook it on the stove) and everything still turned out way yummy! Next time, I might add a bell pepper for some extra crunch.

The flavor of these beans was very yummy. I added some smoked sausage and a little more bacon...and used black beans instead of the garbanzos. We smoked the bean in the smoker along with 2 racks of ribs for Memorail Day 2012.

I made these for a cookout, and they were a big hit.  I changed the recipe by not adding the garbanzo beans (they tend to be a little hard).  I also added my batch to a crock pot and let it simmer for about 2 hours before serving.  Way better than any store brand can.

Amazingly delicious! I halved the recipe because we only had a few people over. That meant that I had to modify the amounts and types of beans used, but the basic recipe was perfect. I used a cheapy can of Pork & Beans, Pinto beans & Great Northern beans and everyone (even the bean haters) loved these!

Absolutely delicious.  There are never any leftovers.  I usually add different beans, depending on what I have or what is on sale, but I always use black beans.  I like the color variation.  A great recipe!

I've made this two times. Delicious and very versatile too. They work great without bacon (just saute the onions and garlic in olive oil instead of bacon fat). I didn't want the MSG from the canned baked beans so I added 1 can of black beans + 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup instead. I always add an extra onion or two, that makes it a lot more flavorful. Turkey bacon is also good instead of regular. Thanks for this great recipe Pat!

I thought it was good.  Make sure you use a good molasses.  It will make or break the recipe.

These are really good beans.  We like our baked beans cold better than hot, so the next time I will check the consistency of the sauce at about 50 minutes, as they were just a bit dry at 1 hour.  I also like to freeze them in small containers, all the more reason to have a little more sauce in them.  Delicious flavor.

Amazing!  My friends could not get enough of it!  We omitted garbanzo beans but don't know what they would have added, anyway.  Easy and perfect!

I'll make them again, but I think next time I would turn the oven down and cook longer, or maybe do in the crock pot as the beans were still a little firm, I like them a bit softer to chew. Also might add a touch of vinager to them next time. Husband loved them though.

I have made these beans more times than I can count. They are always a huge hit & they're great as left-overs.  I use the real bacon bits in a bag to speed up the process. I toss them in the saute pan with the garlic & onions. I don't use garbanzo beans but I do use black beans. Great recipe. Thanks!

These were the best baked beans I've ever had. I made them for a party and everyone who ate them asked for the recipe. The mixture of different bean textures was just phenomenal. I trippled this recipe and added Butter Beans to the mix because I thought the variety in sizes added a nice appeal as well. I also added about 1/2 c. more onion. DELICIOUS!

This was just okay.  I didn't think that they were much different than most baked beans that I've had.  I would leave out the garbonzo beans next time.  They were just too hard for my taste.

These are amazing.  I served them to my dad, who usually eats canned baked beans.  He and everyone else LOVED them.  We got black forest bacon from Whole Foods to go all out-- thick and yummy.  The flavor is the perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and salty.  Yum!

Made this recipe last weekend for a party and they turned out great. Everyone loved them and it was super easy to make. I took someones suggestion and threw it all in a crockpot and turned it on for 6 hours. I used peppered bacon and it was a little spicy for me but all my guests kept raving about how good it was. This recipe is a keeper.

WOW!  Talk about takin it up a notch.  Try this with Bush's Grillin Texas Ranchero beans as the base if you like it sweet and spicy.  Also used half ketchup and half bbq sauce.

Awesome recipe!  I added a little smoked steak that we had leftover.  I did not use the garbanzo beans or the can of baked beans.  I used 2 cans of great northern beans, 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans.  I also cooked it in the crockpot after I cooked the bacon.  TASTY!!!

This recipe is nearly identical to one published in the BH&G cookbook. It's true you can substitute any canned beans to suit your preference. I usually include one can of beans w/jalepenos (Ranch Beans are the best) to give it just the right amount of kick.

I've always mixed different beans in my mom's Great Northern baked bean recipe, so I guess that's a slippery slope, because now I plan to abandon the family traditional recipe in favor of Pat's. These may be the best baked beans I've ever eaten. Yep, they are.

I am from Texas, where we specialize in all things barbecue! I picked this recipe among others because it appeared to be closer to homemade than the rest. I especially didn't want to take a plain old can of baked beans and spice 'em up, that's not my forte.  So what I did differently was this:  I used only two cans of pinto beans (didn't have time to make 'em homemade) MINUS the kidney/garbanzo (which we don't normally eat in TX anyway) and MINUS canned baked beans.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is, substituting syrup for the molasses since I didn't have any (I couldn't tell the difference). I also added one fresh jalapeno, seeded and chopped for an extra kick.  When they came out they were good, but were still missing something, so I added salt and paprika and VOILA!!!  THEY WERE FANTASTIC!  I hope you find this helpful.

This is an excellent baked bean recipe which also comes out very good in the crock pot.  I follow the recipe as written with a couple of small short cuts -- I don't fry the bacon or saute the onion and garlic.  Instead I use pre-cooked bacon pieces from the store and I just throw the bacon and chopped onion and garlic in when I mix up the rest of the ingredients.  The last couple of times I've made this I've also thrown a can of black beans into the mix, but otherwise I don't really make any changes because it doesn't need any.  THANKS for the yummy recipe!

Excellent beans.  Some changes I made.  I rinse and drain all beans (except baked beans).  Subbed black beans for the garbanzos.  Added to taste a little minced chipotle in adobo for a little kick.  Also, pre-cut the bacon into ½ inch pieces.  Cook bacon in a cast iron pot until done and add the onions (and don’t drain any drippings) and cook until almost tender.  Add the garlic about one minute before the onion is done.  Stir in all beans EXCEPT the baked beans.  Stir about one minute or so.  Add the rest of the ingredients.  Mix well.  Bake in the cast iron pot in a 350-degree oven until desired thickness.

Much better than canned baked beans with a good balance of sweet and tangy.  Well worth the effort and leaves your house smelling great!  I used a pound of Great Northern Beans which I soaked overnight.  I doubled the bacon.  I added two TBS of BBQ sauce in addition to the other ingredients and a tsp of "Colman's English Mustard" powder in addition to the prepared yellow mustard.  I baked them covered for only 40 minutes to make sure they weren't mushy and then I finished them uncovered under the broiler on low to caramelize the surface.

Made these for a cookout last night and they came out perfect!! Substituted butter beans for garbanzos just out of personal preference. Didn't know I was out of Worcestershire so that got left out and I replaced 1/4 c of the ketchup with BBQ sauce. Makes a pretty decent amount and almost all were gone by the end of the meal.... definitely a keeper!!

WONDERFUL recipe!!!  I substituted Navy Beans for garbanzo beans.  I kept everything else the same, and I'm glad.  I haven't even BAKED them yet, and they already taste wonderful.  I'm letting them sit overnight in the frig and I'll bake them right before dinner.  :)

These were pretty good but definitely not the best I've had.  I cut the recipe in half and thought it was just a bit too sweet.  I think next time I'll use either molasses or brown sugar...not both!!!

My favorite bake bean recipe to date. Love the texture that the different beans give it. The last time I made it I substituted 1/4 cup of ketchup for 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce.

I was skeptical about making this for my 4th of July cookout but I am glad I did.  I made a few changes to this recipe, I replaced the garbanzo beans with black beans instead of bacon(my husbancd does not eat pork)I used ground turkey. Threw everything in a slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6 hours.  There was nothing left!!!  This will be my go to baked beans recipe from now on.

So far, everyone loves this recipe!!  It's so unique with the 5 types of beans.  I usually add more bacon and cut down a bit on the ketchup, molasses & brown sugar.  Have baked them in the oven and in a crockpot - I'm happy with either process.  I make sure I keep all the beans in stock, ready for another batch!

I make these all the time and everyone comments on how GREAT they are.   Not a big fan of changing things or making comments but I have replaced the Garbanzo beans with butter beans and they turn out great.  Also added a few shakes of liquid smoke for a different flavor.

Very good. I think these would be great in the crock pot. I made a half batch and it was plenty for 6.   I also think these would be fine with just regular baked beans. No need for so many different cans.

I made this recipe in a slow cooker and had to sub out some the beans but the sauce was perfect. The flavor and texture were just right. Reminded me of the baked beans I had as a child that were cooked all day in the oven. Thanks for the memory.

I've made this recipe 2 times. Once at our school lunch program without the bacon and it was a hit. The second time at home without mustard due to an allergy again what a hit. Love this recipe.

These were very tart and too over-powering. They needed more liquid (I drained the beans). Their basic flavor was good and I will make again - tweaking the recipe. I used turkey bacon and that was a success. The red kidney beans remained too firm, so I think I will use another can of pintos instead.

This is very close to my own baked bean recipe. But I usually just use five cans of pork beans. I tried this one because of the variety of beans. I didn't use the chick peas though, I knew I would freak my guest out with those in there, just used another can of pork beans instead. I only put in 2 tablespoons of molasses and increase the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also add a couple dashes of liquid smoke and a couple tablespoons of BBQ sauce. I didn't have a lot of time so I used the precooked bacon pieces you put on salad (but can say if you have the time, regular bacon is much better). Although I did cook the onions and garlic in the 2T of bacon grease as this recipe calls for...we keep our bacon grease in a jar on hand. My own recipe I just mix in the chopped onions without the precooking. I didn't notice any onion taste at all with precooking them...and missed the little crunches of onion bits. I just mix it all up in a 9X13 glass casserole dish, no bowls needed and baked uncovered on 350 for an hour and twenty min. Everyone loved these beans, but my husband did ask why I didn't put any onion it it. Our guest don't like onions so I guess it worked out fine. I do like the variety of the beans and might try some black beans instead of the chick peas next time.

These are the best baked beans. I have cooked them in the oven and in the crock pot. I like the oven the best, but the are still delicious in the crock pot. The secret to ensuring that they turn out good, is to not skimp on the bean brand. Use good quality can beans.

These beans are great and so easy to make. I used to make my beans from scratch but with limited time before a big party I decided to try these. They were a big hit, everyone loved them! I made them the day before and just popped them in the oven to reheat the day of the party. Excellent!

Easy, tasty recipe! I prepared this recipe in a Crockpot as recommended by another poster... I just dumped it all in the crock and put it on low for 4 hours, high for 2 hours. I doubled the recipe to feed 20 people -- ENTIRE CROCK was eaten in 20 minutes!! Got to be some kind of record! Thanks!

Awesome! I have made this for my husbands work potlucks and its always a hit. The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 1 heaping tsp of chili powder. Also, I took out the garbanzo beans because they are so dry and just added another can of pinto beans.

Awesome recipe!  Replacing my "from scratch" recipe as it is so easy and foolproof. I like to double the recipe and use butter beans instead of garbanzos. The sauce is perfection!  The recipe is always requested.

This recipe is great.  I make it vegetarian style without the bacon and throw in any beans I have in the pantry.  I always put in some black beans.  Yummy!  I cook it in the slow cooker.

This recipe is fabulous and has been a family favorite for years now. We substitute dijon mustard for the yellow but otherwise don't change a thing. Delicious- saves well and is even better the next day!

I've never really been a bean fan but I made this along with a ham for our Christmas dinner and it was amazing! Since I don't like garbanzo beans I used Butter Beans instead but that was the only change I made. The beans were even better the second day. I think next time I will try making it in the crock pot because I think the longer it cooks the better the flavor.

I loved these!  There is a real depth of flavor in them. Next time I might just use a little less brown sugar because I prefer them less sweet.

I made this using 2 cans of chili beans, 2 cans of pork and beans and one can of kidney beans~ all the rest of the recipe I followed exactly~ until the end.  I put everything in a crock pot to cook overnight.  In the morning I tasted it and decided to add about 1/4 cup more of brown sugar.  Just right!

Made exactly as written.  Really good but too sweet for my taste.  Just a little less sugar and molasses and they'd be perfect for me.

Loved the seasoning/flavors of this recipe.  I used dried beans (navy and kidney) because I had them on hand and had the time to prep them.   Took the beans to a family dinner; everyone loved them!

These are the only beans I make, and I am requested to bring them to all pot luck parties.  The only addition I make is to add a half pound of ground beef that I brown with the onions.  I normally don't buy molasses, but instead substitute maple syrup.  Just delicious!

Delicious!  I made this as written and it turned out great!  The only thing I do differently now is that I cut up the bacon before frying, add the onion and garlic during the last half of cooking, drain the grease, the combine everything in my crockpot and cook on low all day, taking the lid off during the last hour so it will thicken.  Fabulously easy and tasty!  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Very good.  I made these in the slow cooker and everyone liked them.  I left out the garbanzo beans because that just sounded weird to me and hubby isn't a fan of them.  Added another clove of garlic and used applewood smoked bacon.  My family enjoyed them and they were easy - not quite the depth of flavor as my own baked beans.  The recipe makes quite a bit.

Great flavor, very easy to make.  I used honey instead of the molasses and it tasted great.  Only thing I would change next time is to switch out the garbanzo beans with a can of pinto beans.  The garbanzo beans make it sort of crunchy.

My husband and guests enjoyed this recipe, but I didn't care for it.  I didn't like the texture of the beans, specifically garbanzo and kidney beans.  There is also too much ketchup taste to my liking.  Since I'm the cook in the family and my husband and family love my recipe for BBQ baked beans, I'll stick to my recipe from now on.

Wonderful recipe and Pat's right, There was NOTHING left over. Because of availability, I substituted a squeeze of honey for the molasses (I don't care for really sweet beans so I didn't use the whole amount) and a can of cannellini instead of garbanzo. I also chopped up a jalapeno pepper and added it to the onions while cooking. This will be a go-to recipe for years to come - thanks for sharing it!

I made this for a family get together and everyone liked it.  One person raved about it.  Personally, I thought it was a bit to molassesy (if that's a word) for me.  I used kidney, cannelinni, pinto, northern, and baked beans.  I would probably make this again.

I made a double recipe for a BBQ. I had so much food plus there were the non-bean eaters at the party so there was plenty left over. My husband really liked it and wanted me to save it all.  I froze servings in Ziplock bags. When we wanted some, we would just empty a baggy in a pot with just enough water so it wouldn't stick and warm it up. I actually liked it better that way. It gave it an extra creaminess and the beans were softer.  It was very handy but dangerous since it isn't such a low calorie dish. It's one of those foods that leaves a craving.

I made these for a SuperBowl party to go with ribs. They were a big hit! My only changes- half the molasses and bake uncovered. You really can use any beans- I used a combo of white, Northern, kidney and black. Pretty and yummy! Thank you Kelly and Pat!

A very nice change of pace from typical baked beans. I used 2 cans of pintos, since I didn't have any great northerns, and added 1 can of black beans (no garbanzos we don't like them) and 1 can of butter beans instead of the "baked beans". I drained and rinsed all my beans to cut down on the sodium. I didn't have any molasses so I used 1/4 Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead. They look as good as they taste with the different beans in them. I served this with Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork BBQ recipe from this site. It was a great meal! Thanks Pat for sharing this.

An absolute hit! My husband requested baked beans for dinner, and I lost my grandma's recipe. This was the closest resemblence to it, so decided to give it a try. I halved the recipe, and used dry small red beans and dry pinto beans that I had cooked the day before. My children (which are the absolute most picky eaters in the universe!) asked if they could have seconds!!! That is unheard of with my kids! My husband also loved them! I will DEFINITELY be making these again!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!

Everyone loved these beans, and they are so easy to  make.  They were going to be sitting out for a short time before eating, so cooked them overnite in the crockpot, and took them warm in the crockpot,and they stayed wonderfully.   Hit with everyone.  Will definitely do again

I like this one a lot, and the family raved.  I only used 4 cans of beans, for the # of guests.. and would keep it that way.  also - I didn't see where we're told about draining or not.. so I did PARLTLY.  next time I'm draining all the way.  good stuff - thanks for this one!

This recipe is great! These are the best baked beans I've ever had. I didn't use the large medley of different beans - I used four cans of pinto beans, and one can of baked beans. Everything else I kept to a tee. Soooo good! This is definitely my new barbeque dish! It was also a hit at the BBQ I brought it to today!

I had to make baked beans in a hurry, so I didn't quite have the right mix of beans that this called for, but the sauce was wonderful. I ended up using Roman Beans, and both dark/light kidneys. The sauce was nice and sweet, but not too sweet - every one loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Very popular with my family. Having made this a few times, there are only some small variations that I make. More black pepper required. I use more bacon and I think that garbanzo beans should be replaced by something softer, like maybe butter beans. I really enjoy the different look and texture of the various beans however. I bake the bacon on a foil-lined cookie sheet @ 375 for about 25 minutes or until crispy. Then I set it aside to drain on paper towels and chop it when cool. I use a small amount of the bacon grease to sautee onion and garlic. I have also done the bacon step a day ahead of time and it made the process a little more streamlined. These are well suited for the slow cooker also. About 3 hrs on high should do it!

These were the best baked beans Ive ever had! Ive never made any before, but Ive ate my fair share. Everyone raved how great these were. Everyone told me that I am now in charge of bringing the beans from now on, dont know if thats a good thing or not. Lol. Reading what others wrote, I didnt use the garbanzo beans, I doubled the baked beans. And for MY personal taste, I dont think I'll use the kindney beans either. That was just my opinon, but everyone else loved them. Next time I will just double the pinto beans and the baked beans and leave out the garbanzo and kidney beans.

Wonderful baked bean recipe. I made them in a large foil pan,enough to serve about 25 people at my son's graduation party.They were a hit. I played around with the type of beans I used; Great Northern,pinto and regular baked beans and the results were great. FYI - its always hard to judge how much to make,and to double everything or not. I used 2 cans each of the beans(regular beans I used the large size) and I did have leftovers.Also,bake for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for them to get nice and hot. I have another party this weekend,and I'm making these again :) Thanks for a great recipe.

The flavor was good, but the garbanzo beans added an interesting crunch.  Would not add them again.

YUMMMMMMY!!!  I loved these!  I didn't change a thing except I forgot the brown sugar and they were still a hit with my family!  Lots of work I found but worth it!  I think this would be a good one to make extra and freeze.

All gone!  I will definitely keep and make these beans again.  Like other reviewers combined all the ingredients in a slow cooker and cooked all day on low.  I turned it up to high for 2 hours before serving.

My mom has been making a recipe similar to this since I was a child. I suggest cooking a green pepper (diced) with the onion and then adding in cut pineapple. This is best in a Crockpot! One of my favorite summer or anytime dishes!

I made as directed except I used a pound of bacon.  I cut into small pieces,cooked it and added half into the beans.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking I sprinkled the remaining bacon on top.  Made for a nice texture. May cut down on molasses and sugar slightly next time and cook a little longer (about 20 min) but it is a good, solid recipe.

Very tasty and easy!  I made a triple batch.  Used oil instead of bacon to saute onion and garlic.  Added rest of ingredients, with all beans drained except baked beans, though I did dump off some of the liquid from them too.  Heated through, then transferred to crockpot for a few hours.  No leftovers, bummer.

These baked beans are my new favorite!  I made them for a mother's day cookout and everyone loved them!  Per the advice of previous reviewers, I cut back the sugar and used more bbq sauce than ketchup.  I will definitely make this again!

These turn out to be very sweet.  Fun to experiment with all types of beans with this.  Turns out great.  Next time I will double the bacon and halve the sugar.  A great basic recipe to start with and add ones own flair to.

I made these for a work party,after reading other reviews, I opted for butter beans instead of garbanzo, and also cut the molasses in half. They turned out delicious. There were none left. I also cooked in the crock pot on low for 5-6 hours.. taking lid off the last 30 min before serving. They thickened up perfectly. Also, I made them the night before in the crock pot and reheated the same way the next day. They were great!

This is the best baked bean dish I've ever had. My recipe differs just a bit though. 1 can each kidney, baby limas and Bush's baked beans. I, too, add extra bacon. There's usually none of this dish left, so I double the recipe so I can have it as a snack (even good cold!). I wondered about black beans, which I love, so I'm glad to see someone has tried it.

As written, I would give this a three because of the heavy molasses taste. However, I would make these again and either not use molasses, only brown sugar - or just a tablespoon or two of it. It has potential, just not as written.

Made this just like the recipe except I didn't have any molasses. They were very good and will be even better with the molasses. They will probably thicken up faster when it is in the dish as it should be.

this is my favorite baked bean recipes.  so easy and a little different than most.  personally i love the garbanzo beans and never leave them out.  i sub black beans for the baked beans, that cuts the sweetness a little and adds a nice texture and color to the mix.  i'm making these for labor day and think i will try cooking them on the stove til bubbly as someone else suggested.  this recipe does make a lot, so plan for a big crowd or you will be eating them for a week.

Very good.  At first when I had tasted everything together when it had only been cooking for a short time, I thought: "oh my god what did I do" I started to think that maybe I should've rinsed off the can of baked beans.  They had a sauce w/ them and thought it would give it alot more flavor.  Well for awhile I thought it really messed up the sweet taste I had going.  But after a few hours in the crock pot it all tasted wonderful.  I'm just not so sure that I like the mixture off all different beans, but that is my only complaint, oh and that it needs alittle more sugar.   Also I thought that 1/2c mollasses would be to much so I only added 1/4c and 1/4c maple syrup.  Turned out great.

Great recipe, but I made a lot of changes. Here's my amended recipe: 
1 cube of butter (cut up)
2 tbsp dried, minced onions
3/4 cup catsup
9 (15-16 oz) cans of beans, any variety
1 tbsp yellow mustard
1-2 tsp freshly ground pepper
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup molasses (I used Grandma's Molasses)
I put all this into a crock pot and let it simmer all day. I brought it to a BBQ and my beans were the only ones that were gone at the end. :) Stir it occasionaly while it is simmering to avoid sticking.

I made this for a get together we had with some friends and family. They loved it. Everyone wanted to take the recipe home with them. One of my husband's friends won't even come over unless he asks if I'm going to make them.

Great Recipe! Made this for the 4th of July and got Rave reviews! The only problem I noticed was that the garbanzo beans were kind of hard after the baking time. I will definately make again might stove cook the beans first.

This was a pretty good recipe. I used 8 slices of bacon (cuz we love bacon)! Next time I may add a finely chopped jalepeno to give it some zip. Made the day before and left in fridge overnight. I thought that would help the beans to soak up the sauce, but it didn't seem to. I also may skip the garbanzo beans next time and use some other bean. Overall it was very good - just not a 5 star recipe for me, but close (4.5)!! We'll see after I add some heat!

Excellent; made it for 30 people with inexperienced helpers as a learning program. It was easy, very forgiving on subbing ingredients and overunder measurements- and we had nothing but rave reviews regarding the end product.

Great recipe. I make this using three cans of beans, any combination can be used. Limas add a nice look to the dish. Molasses isn't necessary either. I just use more brown sugar. Great for potlucks and BBQs.

This is my new favorite baked beans recipe!!  As a vegetarian, I use veggie bacon but everything else I follow according to the recipe.  It's that good that it doesn't need alterations!!  Everyone in my family loves it and it doesn't last long.

I'm not a huge baked bean fan, but I did think that these beans were pretty tasty.  The combination of beans made it taste more interesting than normal baked beans, and it was appealing to the eye as well.  I substituted black beans for the kidney beans.  Got many compliments.

I don’t like ketchup or mustard so I used barbecue sauce instead & made them in a crockpot on low for 3 hours, then turned it up to high for an hour or two.  I also used turkey bacon & used spicy chili beans to replace the canned baked beans.  I was really nervous because I was making this for a group that was camping with us, but everyone LOVED them!!! I’ve already been told I have to make them next time.

I found this recipe about 8 years ago and it has stood the test of time. It is perfect for a large crowd and a great accompaniment to any kind of bbq. It is definitely not a light dish, calorie wise, but it is delish. Both the young and old have always raved about it. It would also be a lot less expensive if you cooked your own beans from dried.

This is a great recipe, the only reason for the 4 is that there was one bean I didn't care for, it seemed really dry, not sure if it was the northern or the garbanzo but i think it was one of them. Otherwise, I'll just remove them and replace, the sauce is fantastic!

I really liked these, or at least the version of this that I made. I didn't want to add the can of baked beans, but I figured those beans are already seasoned so the seasoning must be all for the unseasoned beans. Therefore I stuck to the rest of the recipe mostly as-is*, and it turned out very nice.

*We don't like super sweet baked beans, so I did cut down on the sugar/molasses. And I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted bbq sauce for some of the ketchup. But those are personal preferences we would have done for just about any baked beans recipe.

Great beans! I had to use a crock pot because I was using the oven for something else. I let them cook on low for 4 or 5 hours & the whole neighborhood stopped by to see what smelled so good. A good go-to recipe.

These went over well when I made them for a recent cookout. The five types of beans makes a nice change from the usual baked bean recipes.

Solid, but really you're cooking canned beans (which includes baked beans) with bbq sauce.  I liked the addition of the bacon.

I rarely leave reviews but I love these beans. I tried it exactly as written and they were good but I made a few modifications the third time I made them and they are awesome. I add more sugar, less molasses,use 1.5 pack of bacon. I also sub half of the ketchup for sweet brown sugar BBQ sauce. I used 2 can of Bush's steakhouse grillin beans, 1 black beans, 1 great northern beans,  and 1 dark kidney beans.

This is a great basic baked bean recipe and it's always a hit, especially on those outdoor barbecue kind of days. Perfect with ribs!
My wife is vegetarian so I always leave out the bacon these days, but I have made it with ground sausage in the past and that just puts these beans into orbit!
Instead of ketchup I use 1 can of tomato soup (without the extra can of water), then add the molasses, brown sugar, onions, and a little bit of my favorite barbecue sauce for that extra zing and leave out the  Worcestershire. Then I throw in a mixture of 8 or 9 different beans, including a can each of cut yellow and green beans for a touch of color.
After combining everything I thinly slice a sweet onion and lay the slices on top while they bake, they add a nice flavor and finishing look. 
I do drain my cans beforehand except maybe a little of the thicker juice from the kidney and similar beans, otherwise there's way too much liquid and you wind up with bean soup instead. At least an hour at 350 covered, then another hour or more at around 225 and they come out amazing. 
I've also learned to make 2 batches of these in different baking dishes, a large one for guests and a smaller one for us for the next day, otherwise there's never anything left over for the cook!

I made this recipe for our Father's Day Cook Out and it was a hit.  I made it exactly as listed except I kept it in the oven on 200 degrees after the original bake time until our guests started arriving.  Oh, I also added 2 seeded and chopped jalapeños.

These are delicious! I cook them on the stove and like to add bell pepper, vinegar and a little cayenne to give them some sweet, hot tanginess.

It was really good and flavorful.  Very pretty to look at.  I did make a few changes for my taste.  I used black beans instead of pintos.  I used ground beef instead of bacon.  And I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  Turned out great.

These were wonderful!  Our BBQ was a great success.  I used the recipe ALMOST to the T.  I didn't use red beans but rinsed black beans and added all the rest of the recipe and instead of baking them in the oven, I did what one reviewer suggested and put them in my crock-pot.  They turned out wonderful.

This is a sensational recipe! Everyone loves them and I am asked to bring these to almost every summer party and football party now. I save time by chopping the raw bacon and cooking it together with the chopped onion and minced garlic. I also add about a teaspoon of liquid smoke. Then I just mix everything together and throw it in a crock pot for a few hours on low. PERFECT every time!

Great recipe.  I did replace the garbanzos with a can of butter beans.  Those are always a favorite mixed in with baked beans.  And I left out the sugar as I was having guests that don't like sweet foods.  I did add the molasses as stated.  Came out delicious... didn't even miss the added sugar!

Made this for the first time today, used a 13 dry bean mix from Bob's Mills.  Soaked the beans all night then mixed it up and cooked them in the crock pot all day.  Had to add some extra beef stock because the dry beans really  continue to soak up the juice.  Also didn't have enough catsup so used up my chili sauce from the shrimp sauce I made the other day.  Yum!

Amazing!  Made this last night and followed the directions exactly with the exception of substituting butter beans for the garbonzo as I don't care for those. No leftovers and I think I could have doubled it as we liked it so much.  No need to try any other recipe.  This one is perfect.

I like the use of different type of beans in this recipe.  I thought it was a bit sweet.  I will reduce the brown sugar next time.

I truly love baked beans.  My mom has an incredible recipe that I have tried to replicate and this recipe comes pretty close.  I did alter the beans in the recipe.  I used two 28oz cans of bushed baked beans and one 16oz can of Northern beans which I drained.  I also nixed the ketchup.  I like the onion flavor so I also added more than what the recipe called for.  Update: These are even the better the next day!  When I make half of the recipe I use about 1/3 cup of brown sugar.

I made these beans for a family reunion and they were a huge hit!!!  I doubled the recipe and I followed a previous suggestion and used butter beans instead of garbanzo beans and am really glad that I did. I will definitely be making these beans again and again.

I threw everything in the slow cooker and left it on low for the day and by dinner time the house smelled so good we couldn't wait for our steaks to grill. These turned out great! There's only three of us and the crock was nearly empty! My son even went back for more an hour after we ate!! Since we don't eat pork, I eliminated the bacon and the can of baked beans and used 2 cans of pinto beans and 2 cans of white beans instead. Also, after I scanned the recipe ingredients, I had ground mustard in my head instead of yellow mustard so I used that. We'll definitely be making these again.

The flavor and texture of these beans were incredible!  I omitted the bacon (to make them vegetarian) and cooked them in a crockpot.  There was a quite a bit of "sauce" so I added another can of black beans.  I will make these again and again!

I didn't have molasses so I subbed honey and dark brown sugar.  It still turned out well.  I also used turkey bacon since we don't eat pork.  Good recipe!

I made this in a crock pot for a family reunion.  Everyone thought they were amazing!  I was asked for the recipe!!! To do it in the crock pot, I just cooked the bacon, onion, garlic as the recipe says then added all the ingredients to the crock pot.  I did double the recipe so the crock pot would be full enough to cook correctly.  I cooked on low for 3-4 hours, I believe.  So tasty!  I'm making it again for another family party on the other side of our family.  I'm excited to see what everyone says this time since I'll be doing it in the oven probably.

WOW these are the most delicious baked beans that I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I put them in the crock pot beacuse it was way too hot here to turn the oven on! The blend of flavors was perfect and the mixed beans put it over the top.  I vow to never buy another can of (except to mix into these) baked beans again.  Thank you so much Kelly for sharing this recipe.

This is by far the most excellent baked beans recipe in the entire universe and I mean really! There needs be no drifting away from the original recipe. My family doesn't like garbanzo beans, so I just doube the baked beans, and the only baked beans I use are Bush's Country Style! Happy eatings!

Spectacular.  I followed this recipe to a T and came out with some great baked beans that the entire party enjoyed.  Do use some butter beans, since they add a lot of fun variety, even if just in shape!

This recipe has been a hit each time I make it! I made a couple of changes. I only used 1/4 cup molasses and then used 6 Tbs of brown sugar substitute. I also added 1 pound of turkey kielbasa that I brown in the skillet after finishing the oncions and garlic. A great source of protein, and now, with a lower sugar content!!

These are excellent baked beans.  I have made them numerous times for group gatherings and they are always a hit.  I think that the combination between sweet and savory is perfect.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  This is my new standby for baked beans.

This is the first time I have made baked beans.  This was easy and had great flavor!  I liked the different variety of beans but the garbanzos were a little more crunchy than we would have liked. Maybe I should have cooked a little longer?  I think the next time I am going to try to make them in the crock pot.  I don't want mushy, but a little more of a similar consistency.

In a word: yummy! My bacon went bad (didn't know that could happen!) so I was forced to use breakfast sausage links. I can't wait to try it with the bacon because these beans were so delicious even with the links! The great thing is that you can adjust the beans to your liking, a very forgiving recipe. I made them for labor day and cooked them on low overnight in my crock pot. Served along side North Carolina-Style Pulled Pork and Mom's Coleslaw, both from this site...my sister told me that if she ever remarries she wants me to cater the wedding! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

I've made this twice now, once with the baking method, and once in the slow cooker for 8 hours. I prefered the slow cooker version, the beans are softer and the flavors seem to mix a little bit better. Plus, it's just easier!

These beans are the best! Made them a few times for family gatherings, but when i made them for work, everyone wanted the recipe.I did add hickory BB-Q sauce in replace of half the ketchup and added couple splashes of hot sauce. Any beans will do. Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm giving this a 5 even though I did make some changes, because it would  have been good without the changes.  I made this basically as directed, but as there were going to be several vegetarians at the potluck, I made this w/o the bacon and added about a tsp of liquid smoke (hickory flavor) to add the smoky flavor.  Also used one can each: baked beans (vegetarian), black, pinto, white, garbanzo, kidney, butter; homemade barbeque sauce instead of the catsup; and added about 1/3 cup of bourbon (just because I was in the mood!).  Dumped everything into the slow cooker around noon, and cooked on high for an hour, then on low until dinner (about 6 hours total).  We did not notice any crunch from beans or onion, but neither was it terribly mushy. Wonderful addition to our holiday picnic potluck - thanks!

Followed recipe as written, after baking, still have a bit of crunch.  Maybe I just like mine squishy.  So put in the crock pot for 3 hours.  Good flavor.

Scaled this to 80 servings for a work function. Definitely the best baked beans I've had. Really enjoyed them. Admittedly, we made the decision to not drain off the excess bacon fat because, honestly now, is there a such thing as excess when it comes to bacon fat? Pat, you're a bacon and bean hero!

I brought this to a barbecue and several people stated that they thought they were very good.  I thought they were fine, but I will probably try a new recipe next time and hope to find one that will knock my socks off.

This baked beans were so good!  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and omitted the chick peas.   I replaced this with Bush's baked beans.   I put all the ingredients in the crockpot and cooked on low for six hours.   Then I turned it on high and took the lid off so it could thicken up.   This was really good and I will definitely make it again.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet!  These are the best, I actually crave them, but only make them when company comes since my family isn't into beans. (I can't figure out why!)  Don't change a thing, unless it's just a substitution for the beans, and use the best beans you can find (brands really are different, especially with the garbanzos--some cheaper brands have a really metallic taste to them).  I'm making them tomorrow for Memorial Day and I'm going to try the crockpot.

This recipe is missing a key part of any great BBQ-restaurant-style baked bean recipe- the "smoke" flavor that you get from adding smoked brisket/burnt ends.An alternative to the smoked meat is to addd a little "liquid smoke" (can be found at any grocery store), sub out 1/4 C of the ketchup for quality BBQ sauce (adjust the molasses depending on the sauce's ingredients), and use a good smoked bacon- 6 slices is not nearly enough for my taste.

These were so good!  Only change I made was to swap out garbanzo beans with a can of navy beans.  Loved the variety of beans all mixed together.  I also added a crunchy crust to it - 1 cup panko, 3 chopped green onions, and a couple slices chopped bacon.  Topped with that, put in oven and it was nice and crispy by the time the beans were done.

These were great.  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika.  Will add 1/2 tsp. next time.  I followed one suggestion of cooking in the microwave to cut down on the oven time by 1/2 an hour. The next night I reheated it for an hour at 350 (covered)and placed two pork loins on top.  I turned the loins over after 1/2 cooking. This was great. When I make them again.  I'm going to cook the loins with the beans.  It made a great meal.

Very good recipe!  I cut out the brown sugar and reduced the ketchup to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I also doubled the baked beans and elimited the chick peas.  Very good!

Pretty good but way too sweet for our taste.  I will make them again but omit the brown sugar and stay just with the molasses.  Also, I think I'll add a little vinegar to give them a little tang.  They were a little plain for us.  Thanks though.  We will use this recipe just with a couple of canges.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! These are the best baked beans I've ever had, my husband loved them too. I froze half and kept the rest for leftovers. I replaced the garbanzo with another can of baked beans, but followed the recipe to the T. I was a little hesitant with the mustard and was close to replacing the ketchup with BBQ sauce, but instead I followed the recipe and it was PERFECT! I also made a few other recipes from here to go along with the beans (mashed potatoes, chicken)the potatoes were kind of bland but just poured some of the beans sauce and it was perfect. GOOOOOOODDDD BEEEAAANNSSS!

this recipes was awesome! I made it to go with ribs when we had friends over, and we all agreed, its pretty great for just beans. I cut this recipe in half, using one can each of great northern beans and kidney beans, both drained. (I didn't have any baked beans handy). Also, I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder instead. I can't wait to make this with the onion, but it still turned out great without it! Excellent recipe!

Just made these for a BBQ, super!  I would cut back on the molasses, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce by 1/2. But otherwise best I've ever made.  Have a lot of requests for the recipe.

Absolutely Outstanding! As with almost everything I cook, I made a few (very few for me) changes. I added about 4 tablespoons of vinegar, 1 each small yellow, red and orange sweet peppers chopped, and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also substituted sweet onion for the onion and chili bottled sauce for the ketchup. One last thing. I mix everything in a 4" deep foil pan, cover with foil and cook them on the BBQ for an hour.

I made this for our Memorial Day BBQ with friends and family. I have to say the best recipe ever for baked beans. I love all kinds of beans, and to have them all in one sidedish was just wonderful! I used bottle bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I baked it in the oven the night before and then just through them in the crock pot on low the next day for the cookout. 
Awesome! 
Thanks Pat!

Just made these this weekend, and my family liked them just fine - but we still had some issues with the original recipe.  First, it's a lot of molasses.  Like someone else commented, if you don't really enjoy molasses, perhaps skip this recipe.  I cut the molasses in half, and added a bit more brown sugar.  My other issue was that the beans didn't really seem to cook enough during the 1-hour cooking time - they still seemed fairly firm.  If I try these again, I'll definitely use the slow cooker method tried by others.  We thought the chick peas fit in just fine!  This recipe was fine as written, just not one of my favorites!

INCREDIBLE!  I've never made beans other than dumping & heating up a can.  These really were not hard, took me a little while but WELL WORTH IT!  Everyone really liked them.  These will be made again for sure!  I skipped the garbanzo beans & just added more of the baked & I think it was the pinto beans?  VERY tasty!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar the next time I make this, but I will make again.

Definitely the most delicious baked beans I've ever tasted. One partI didn't really like were the garbanzos though. Next time I think I might replace them with more northern beans or black beans. This is definitely an awesome recipe for barbeques or anytime you grill. And to all you sugar lovers-don't over do the brown sugar or molasses. its sweet enough as it is, even if you like everything super sweet.

These were great! Good thing I doubled the recipe for the 8 people we were serving! I accidentally left out a can of the kidney beans and used only one can of butter beans (sub for garzbanzo). I thought they were a little sweet, but everyone else raved. Even the kids liked them -- great way to disguise some of those otherwise "funky" beans that they would never eat!

WOW!!! These were fantastic. I made the exact recipe, didn't change a thing! I like to do that first and then tweak the recipe to my liking. I will not change a thing about this recipe. I did drain all of the beans, but also rinsed them and let them dry out a bit in a colander!

Made this recipe for a pre-wedding dinner.  Folks raved about the flavor.  I precooked the bacon, onions and garlic then threw it all in a crock pot.  Worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  I omitted the bacon and the garbanzo beans (since garbanzo beans just don't seem right in baked beans) and doubled the pinto beans to compensate.  I've made this a few times.  It's wonderful.  Moved now to my cookbook.

This was a fantastic recipe. The only changes I made were using a 48 oz. jar of Randall's Mixed Beans in place of the cans of pinto, northern, kidney and garbanzo beans, added 1 T. liquid smoke, and substituted BQ sauce for the ketchup as was suggested elsewhere. I also prepared them in a slow cooker, taking the lid off the last 1 1/2 hours to thicken the sauce, which had also been suggested previously. Great idea.

I made this with 5 (16 oz.)cans of vegetarian baked beans, added extra brown sugar, used turkey bacon, and left out the molasses.  These were FANTASTIC!  An A++ recipe!

The way baked beans are meant to be done. I called them BBQ beans and didn't bake them though. Just let them simmer in  a crock pot for my guests. REALLY DELICIOUS.

We made this dish completely vegetarian which didn’t compromise the overall taste of the beans.  We took the suggestions of other reviews & added an additional Tbs. of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4c maple syrup, an extra clove of garlic & a shake of red pepper flakes.  Our dish took longer than the recipes hour of cooking time.  (More like 2 hours.) The next time we make this we’ll use our crock pot.  Very good flavors & taste.

I made these in the slow cooker, to avoid turning the oven on on a hot day. I cooked the bacon & onion the night before. I didn't have any navy or kidney beans, so I added a can of black beans and a bigger can of Bush's baked beans. The flavor was pretty good, though I must admit I've tasted better. My husband thought that the garbanzo means didn't fit. I'll continue to look around.

I made these beans for a BBQ this weekend and everyone loved them! The only thing I would change for next time is cooking at a lower heat and for an extra hour to really let the garbanzo soften. Thanks for sharing such a great an easy recipe.

Great bean recipe.  It looks very nice with the different colors of the beans. I wish I took a picture of this for all recipes before it got eaten.  The different bean textures and flavor worked very well together.

You don't need to bake these. I simply brown the onion in 2 T of bacon drippings, add the remaining ingredients, and heat on med-high til bubbly. Turn out great but if you like thicker beans, they bake up perfectly. I also omit the garbanzos and instead use another can of Bush beans. Oddly enough, they seem to send the recipe over the top.

great flavor, easy to make.  It does make a bunch but that is good for pot lucks or large gatherings.  I froze leftovers and reheated later. They were still wonderful and my family enjoyed them just as much as the first time.

These are a crowd pleaser!  I get asked to repeatedly bring these to company lunches.  Use any combination of the beans you like to get the correct ammount - some people say the kidney beans dont really fit in, so I typically substitute those.

This was really good and easy to make.  I liked it because it was different from regular baked beans.  I took it to a picnic where there were a lot of people bringing each type of dish (like there were 8 different baked beans) and I didn't try them all but they sure looked the best!  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I only used 1/2 the molasses and they were sweet enough.

I decided to leave all the bacon grease in, and used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 clove.
In spite of that, it just tasted like a big batch of 'Bushs Baked Beans'.
Next time I want a flavor like this, I'll just buy Bush's.

this is always a hit.  I brown ground beef and add that to make it more a meal. I  add green peppers which adds to the flavor of the beans. I  spoon out about a quart of the juice and put it into a pot and thicken it with corn starch and put it back in the pot.

Very good!!! 
I chose this recipe because it had the least amount of sugar and molasses. It was so tasty. Made it for Independence Day and it went perfectly with bbq'd hamburgers and watermelon.

I've made this a few times now.  The first couple of times it went over really well.  I love the combination of beans--original for baked beans. 
 Thank you!  The last couple times I made it, it was not as well received.  Next time I'll double the beans or cut the sauce ingredients in half; as written it's just too strong for us, all intense sauce & no bean flavor.

Yum!!!  I doubled the recipe (approximately). The dish was a huge 4th of July hit.

I made this for a Father’s Day bbq and it was a huge hit! I kept It in a glass casserole dish with foil over it, so it wouldn’t dry up  (we had at least a hour before all the food was ready) when we set the tablet the beans were still hot and not in the least dried out. They were so good. I’ll be making them again for some more summer bbq’s and maybe next time in a crockpot

A new family favorite! I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers - swapped out the garbanzo beans for Great Northern, reduced the molasses and the brown sugar - to accommodate my family's tastes. Kept all the seasonings. I drained all the beans except for two cans, which came in flavored sauces. Make it with the beans you like! This wasn't too soupy as some baked bean dishes are. No running all over the plate! Absolutely delicious, and the various bean textures and colors make the dish attractive and interesting. It's nice to have a good baked bean recipe that doesn't require soaking beans.

I've made these over and over and always get rave reviews. Now that I'm cooking for less people I trim down the ingredients and still delicious! My husband is now a pre-diabwtic so I've started making them with one Tbls Stevia  brown sugar, leave off the molasses and still got rave reviews!

What I love about baked beans is the deep, bacony flavor and the mushy beans. Unfortunately, this recipe was not a favorite. Because so many different types of beans are used, some are mushy and some are hard (the garbanzo and kidney beans). My husband even asked if it was finished cooking after the hour and 15 minutes I put it in for. Also, I don't think there is a super deep flavor. I would recommend putting this in a crock pot for several hours instead of baking for an hour.

Excellent.  Tweeked it a little by adding green pepper and lowering the amount of molasses and brown sugar by a 1/4 of each.

Made this for a beach week dinner side dish and it was a huge hit!  Used black beans instead of garbanzos.  Left out the garlic at the request of my sister but I bet it would have been great if I had included.  Will definitely make again.

I’d give 5 stars but it needed a little heat and WAAAAYYYYY more bacon. Thanks for the recipe! I served it at our neighborhood bbq. It was a hit. I made two versions. One as recipe says the other with my mods: TBS hot sauce, TBS crushed red pepper, pound of bacon, 2 med\lg sweet onions. I’m adding a pic of before baking. It’s definitely a little runny. Maybe because of the extra onions but people loved it soupy.

I made this exactly as written and it was great! Next time I may cook them a bit longer or slow cook them in he crock pot to soften the beans a bit more, but the flavor was perfect. I will be making these for my son’s football team next week...and tripling the recipe!

These were absolutely fantastic and so easy to make! I forgot to get a can of pinto beans while at the store but I had a 28oz  can of Bush's baked beans so I threw the whole can in.  It tasted amazing with the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. I took it to a Labor Day party and everyone though they were great!  Definitely a keeper.  I did follow another persons suggestion and took the foil off and kept in oven for another 15 mins or so to thicken it up and make sure all the beans were cooked. I suggest that as it helped get the consistency just right.

Delicious, if you are not from the USA and don't like food too sweet I suggest using less molasses. It is better to use a mixture of beans but it seems to work with any combination. I definitely recommend this recipe and will be taking it to our next family gathering.

As others have said, this is a recipe from the better homes and gardens cookbook. Mine is in storage and I was so happy to find it online when I needed my “famous” beans recipe! Make this! You won’t regret it. I’ve been making it for years. I cook the bacon and onions in a Dutch oven, then mix all the ingredients in and pop it in the oven - less dishes! Tonight I threw in some leftover shredded rib meat and served with cornbread. Yum!

I personally do not care for baked beans so I didn’t eat any of the beans but I got rave reviews from all of my family.  My husband said that these were the best baked beans he has ever eaten!!  I made this exactly like the recipe and I wouldn’t change a thing!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

I tweaked it up a bit with some smoked paprika and maple syrup, delicious.  Much easier than starting from scratch and soaking beans overnight.

Best beans ever. Substituted an extra can of kidney beans instead of garbanzo beans. Otherwise, followed the receipt just as it is.

I made a recipe like this a few year ago and am still getting requests for it at  pot luck dinners.  Found this one and it was close enough to the original (might have been the same one).
I use more bacon (half pound), a dash of cayenne and a quarter cup of dark rum.  This one is a good recipe on its own or start before adding your own special ingredients.  I cook it in a cast iron chicken fryer (a skillet with higher sides) and server it right from the skillet.

Great recipe.  Easy to prepare.  Substituted black beans for the pinto beans and simmered in a slow cooker for a few hours on low.  Delicious!

I made these for a big family BBQ and they were a huge hit.  I doubled the recipe and let them cook in the crock pot all day.  Didn't change anything else in the recipe.  Loved these and will definitely make again.

WOW! These beans were a grand slam! Initially I wasn't sure that I'd want to use the garbanzos again (believe me, I most certainly will be making this dish again!!!), but the next day, after everything had a chance to sit and get happy together, the flavors and textures were perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this numerous times!  It never fails to please.  I've added black beans to it before.  They add to the variation in color.

I didn't have some of the varieties of beans listed, so I improvised with what I had -- 2 cans kidney beans, 2 cans great northern, 1 can black beans. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. I thought there was too much molasses as it was the most prominent flavor I noticed when tasting the beans. I think if I were to make this again, I would cut back on the molasses since the recipe also calls for brown sugar, which already contains molasses. I was able to salvage this recipe by adding some onion powder, garlic powder, a little bit of salt, and a bit more Worcestershire. This made a 9 x 13 size casserole dish, which is more than enough for 2 of us for dinner, so I'm hoping that the leftovers will taste better for lunch tomorrow.

Easy to make and great hot or cold. We all loved these sweet-tangy beans. Be sure to cut or crumble the bacon into small bite size pieces. Goes great with sliders.

Very festive and tasty. Too sweet even without the brown sugar. Next time I'll cut molasses to 1/3 cup and Inadded salt and a tablespoon of vinegar.

Made this for the 4th of July BBQ and it was a hit!  Everyone loved the flavor.  I used my slow cooker with the recipe as written.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours and then on high for one hour uncovered.

Everyone loved it.  Personally, in future, I'll leave out the Garbanzo (chick peas).  This recipe would be awesome, just simply using 4-5 cans of Bush baked beans w/the other ingredients.

Awesome beans! Everyone loves them. Great for a potluck or cookout. I used black, navy, pinto and baked beans. I don't like kidney beans, so left them out. I've made this recipe twice this summer. Love it.

So this was good as is but I really needed a base recipe for trying to copy a BBQ joints recipe. Things I changed: used a quart each of home canned great northern and pinto beans, added 2 teaspoons curry powder. I'm pretty close to the original but very satisfied with what I turned out with.

The recipe, prepared exactly as directed, was a huge hit at my gathering.  Other than frying bacon (which I hate), this was super-easy to assemble and cook.  For my own personal taste, I would change the types of beans to ones that are less chewy and substantial as I love smushy baked beans; most are not like me so this is a great idea and I have lots of 5-star votes to prove it!

Great classic barbecue recipe. I always find this type of recipe too sweet, so I cut the brown sugar to 2 Tbsp and kept everything else as described . Excellent.

I made this recipe to the T.  I don't like the crunchy beans in this, so next time I will go with all soft type beans.  Other than that, we really liked the flavor.  I will certainly be tweaking this to our likes.

So good. Have made these three times in as many weeks. Made ALMOST as written except made vegetarian by using some veggie bacon and veggie chorizo. Left out molasses because that is a food I have never eaten in my life so didn't want to chance a new taste. Also left out the garbanzo beans since it just seemed like that was a weird kind of bean to go in there. Soooooooooooooooooooooo delicious.

These beans were so great we had them for breakfast :o) The trick to using different types of beans (I used dried black and pinto beans) is that the ENTIRE RECIPE is not done until the bean needing the longest-cooking time is tender. And use a crock pot. Period. I cooked these for 24-30 hours (longer time because they were dried to start) and they came out fabulous! Other changes for healthier (read: less sugar) and tangier/more savory beans: substitute stevia in the raw (20 packets) for the white sugar, chop a huge Costco yellow onion vs 1 cup, 3 heaping tsp. Grandma's molasses, 6 oz tomato paste, 3/4 c. tomato sauce, 3 heaping Tbsp. minced garlic vs 1 clove. *The mustard makes this dish* - use Dijon (with white wine) - 4 heaping Tbsp. to start and then to taste. Omit white sugar and brown sugar, as well as the ketchup. Kept the Worcester sauce and black pepper the same. Meat is optional - I didn't use bacon or turkey because I didn't' have any in the fridge at the time - they were still super good and I'll DEFINITELY be making them again!

These were just okay for me but the people at the party where I shared them loved them  because they like molasses in their baked beans and I do not. Personally, I didn't like that much molasses so I will make them will less next time and I will probably cook the beans a lot longer because they were still hard and I like a softer beans when baked.

My go to recipe from now on.  Didn't have time to soak beans so used canned, well rinsed and drained:  Kidney, Black, Chick pea and 2 cans Mixed.  I trimmed the fat off of a package of low sodium bacon and sautéed it with onion and garlic, then added approx 3 c diced low sodium ham.  For the sauce, I started in a 2 cup measure so I could adjust accordingly:  3 T each ketchup, molasses and BBQ sauce.  2 T maple syrup, yellow mustard, 1 T Worcester, 1 tsp each Smokey Paprika (excellent) and cayenne.  (No brown sugar needed.) I cooked it on the stove top and kept adding sauce and lost track of the proportions.  It tasted soo good, even before baking in the oven.  Due to time I had to finish in the oven, 275*, 2 hrs, but hope to cook this in the crock pot next time.  Thank you for a great motivation!

Very easy and very good beans! the only changes I made were that I only had 1/2 cup of ketchup so I made up the last 1/4 cup with sweet bourbon bbq sauce and I only added 1 tblsp of worschestersire sauce. I cooked mine in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours. Delicious.

It was delicious.  The only thing I did was make the bacon separately and then crumble it right before serving and adding it to the top of the dish.  Got RAVE reviews.  A family favorite to be sure.

I recommend using a center cut piece of bacon and slicing it into thick pieces. After cooking them in the oven, cut them into bean size pieces. Then add to the mix.

Yum! Is all I have to say about this recipe. Always wanted to know how to make this classic and this reminds me of everything good from the past. Made it for a barbecue that I had and it was the first thing to completely go.

Hello baked bean hall of fame? You need Kelly's recipe!  I was skeptical that I would like all the variety of beans but each brought a different role to the party.  The sauce turned out just as I hoped and these were a huge hit at my party.  I did increase the bacon to whatever amount survived the cooking process quality testing so it was more than 6 slices.  Aside from that, the recipe as is turned out great.  I could see maybe adding some cayenne for a heat with the bbq sweet but that is just my preference of liking sweet and spicy combinations.  This is my new bean recipe!

This was delicious!  I used black beans instead of the garbanzos.  Hubby was acting as sous-chef and did not brown the onions and garlic, so I will do that next time, but I cooked it in the slow cooker for a few hours and they cooked down fine.  I added a few dashes of tabasco and cayenne and it wasn't too spicy.  Gave some good depth.  I will definitely make this again.  Might add a little more bacon next time!

These beans were good.  The texture was great.  Only 4 stars because there was a bit of a burnt taste that subtly came through.  I'm not sure if this was from the bacon or from the sugars during baking.

Everyone raved about these! I followed the advice of cooking these low in a crock pot then removing the cover and turning to warm an hour prior to serving. I did not have molasses so I substituted equal parts dark corn syrup. I, also, omitted the chick peas.

This is a wonderful recipe...my "go to" baked beans recipe. So many flavors yet easy to make. I use the whole darn pound of bacon ;) and substitute one can of beans (doesn't matter" for butter beans.

Excellent pot-luck dish.  Very easy and tasty.  I used a cup of BBQ sauce and minimized the ketchup.  I forgot the molasses so it wasn't quite as sweet as I would have liked.  I'll make this again.

These were much better than ready-made canned beans. But next time I'll make them a day ahead because they had more flavor as leftovers. I'll also try substituting can of black beans for the can of baked beans.

These beans came out great and everyone at the bbq I took them to commented about how good they were.   I reduced the brown sugar just a little bit,  but otherwise followed the recipe.   I will use this recipe again for cookouts through the summer.

Very good! I actually used the crock pot as another reviewer suggested and let them cook about 6 hours on low and took the lid off towards the end so they would thicken up. I also added a little salt and a tad more brown sugar since we like sweeter baked beans. I will make these again!

Very good baked bean recipe.  However, if you are going to make this for a crowd, it can become quite expensive.  But every time I have made it, everyone has raved on it!!!  I do not use the Garbanzo beans.  I just substitute with some other kind of beans and it was fine.  Absolutely yummy recipe.

These are my go-to beans for any get-together.  I usually sub large butter beans for the garbanzos, and BBQ sauce for the ketchup.  I also add diced poblano or bell pepper, and they always turn out great!  Once, I made a crumb topping out of crushed ginger snap cookies and melted butter, and it  was AWESOME!

Easy and quick to put together. Love that you can put it in the crock pot and go. Beans were quite good, everyone liked them. However, they were way too sweet for me. Next time I make them I will either cut back on the sugar, or molasses, or both. But definitely a recipe worth another try.

I had a very similar recipe and lost it, this is almost identical.  The recipe I had you were able to use any type of beans; example; limas, butter,baked, etc.  Never had any leftovers to save for the next day it was that popular.

I have used this recipe many times but I make it vegetarian! I omit the bacon and cook the garlic and onion in coconut oil. The church I attend has a monthly potluck and people request that I bring this! (I forgot to take a photo; I'll add one soon). A terrific recipe.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ and they were so good! I took Saveur's advice and added a couple tablespoons of BBQ sauce (Famous Dave's "Devil's Spit"), decreased the molasses to 2 tablespoons and increased the sugar to 2/3 of a cup, however I added directed the ketchup as well. My friends and I aren't huge garbanzo been fans outside of hummus so I just doubled the amount of baked beans (Bush's original). Because of this I might leave out the brown sugar next time because they were very sweet. 

These beans are even better the next day as the baked beans get a little creamier, while the stronger beans retain their shape.

I made the recipe exactly as is and thought they were very good. I do think they could use a bit of vinegar or maybe a dash of liquid smoke. My Grandma made something very similar called Calico Beans that was always my favorite. This recipe works well in a crock pot, too. You just need to take the lid off the crock for the last 45 minutes or so.

Every bit as wonderful as reviews said they were!  Made exactly per recipe and they were a huge hit at the cookout.  It did take me longer than 15 minutes for the preparation, but perhaps I'm just slow.  Definitely making these again. And again.

Made this exact and flavors are excellent!!! Will switch the garbanzo beans next time though, or maybe I just needed to cook them longer. Mine seemed a bit undercooked. All the other beans were soft, the garbanzo beans were a bit firm for my liking.

Wonderful recipe. I get lots of requests. I make them in my crockpot on low heat. I drain all but the baked beans so I watch for scorching. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used different kinds of beans and had to sub bacon bits for real bacon, but it came out ok. My only critique is that the end result seems too sweet. I wish I'd cut the sugar (1/8c) and ketchup (maybe 1/2c).

Oh My Goodness!!!  I have it all together and we can't get over how good it is!  I haven't cooked it yet but if it is in "WOW" status now, can't imagine what it will be like tomorrow when I put it in the crock pot and serve it at family dinner...Just wonderful Kelly!  Thanks!

So Delicious! My family was very nervous about the wide variety of beans used (mostly the chick peas weirded them out) but once they tasted it they couldn't get enough.

These are great beans.  I have the same review as most others do.  The first time I made them I did not care for the texture of the garbanzo beans.  I have since replaced them with rinsed black beans.  At the moment I have some going in the slow cooker and I am going to try substituting 1/4 cup ketchup with BBQ sauce.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. I made it a few years back and a guest just asked me if I could bring it to a party of 75.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is by far the best baked beans recipe EVER!  I always use pintos as my base and then add whatever variety of beans I have in the pantry.  I get asked for this recipe every time I bring it to a gathering.  Great recipe just as written and great to experiment with as well.   I don't care for molasses so I use honey in it's place, real maple syrup sounds great also as one reviewer suggested.

I made this for a large family event and those of us that like beans loved this dish.  The only changes I made were to use white kidney beans in place of the garbanzo beans, eliminated the black pepper and cut the ketchup back to 1/4 cup based on personal preferences of mine.  Great recipe, thanks!

Great recipe. I omitted the garbanzo beans and added white canellini beans.I also added a pinch of Chinese 5-spice. It added a great flavor to the beans.

Normally I despise any baked bean recipe that starts with baked beans. Seems a bit odd to me. However, I needed something for a crowd in a big hurry and gave this recipe a try. I did not follow the recipe's directions. I like quick & easy in certain circumstances -- and this was one of them. I simply tossed EVERYTHING into a large mixing bowl (finely diced garlic, onions & diced bacon -- and tossed in uncooked). Omitted Worcestershire and added 2 teaspoons liquid smoke. Added the beans (using whatever I had in the cabinet), but I did drain two cans. Otherwise I believe there would have been way too much liquid. (I deducted a star for lack of clarification in the recipe as to whether the beans needed to be drained or not. But GLAD I did drain 2.) Baked in the oven, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 1 hour. Turned out nicely done. The pan was wiped out. I will use this recipe again in a pinch -- but add a bit more liquid smoke to it.

Excellent recipe!  I used a wide assortment of beans and followed the recipe.  I let them cook in the slow cooker all night on low so I could take them to work the next morning for a potluck lunch.  Everyone loved them!

This is my go-to baked beans recipe.  I follow this recipe to a T, there is nothing that needs changed.  Sometimes I make this in the crock pot instead of baking in the oven.  5 hrs on low, remove the lid, and cook another hour on high to thicken.  I love the different textures you get from the different beans.  I would eat a bowl of this as a soup if I didn't have any self control!

Used 1/2 the molasses and think they were still on the sweet side! Might be because I replaced half the ketchup with Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce. Served with cornbread. Next time will try in the crock pot.

This is just like MY Aunt Pat's beans, the recipe of which I keep losing. I never liked how sweet the ketchup is, so the only change I make is to use the same amount of Tomato Sauce in place of ketchup. Yummy.

I am making these beans today.  I have had them in the slow cooker for a little over 3 hours now.  I keep going back and tasting them.  They are incredible!  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe.  I hope I have enough left for the cook-out tomorrow!!

I substituted butter beans for the garbanzo and reduced the amount of molasses in half.  It’s still sweet, but does not have an overpowering molasses taste.  This recipe has replaced my 30-yr-old “tnt” baked bean recipe.

This is one of my favorites. I usually follow the recipe as indicated, but add 1 lb of sausage and 1 chopped up chipolte pepper in adobe sauce and a spoonful of the sauce to add a little smokey flavor and just a tiny hint of heat. Delicious recipe that reminds me of my grandmother's baked beans. I also cook them in the crockpot on low all day.

I made his recipe and it was really delicious! I cooked fresh October beans from my local farmers market and I couldn't seem to get them right so the texture was off because of the beans that I used. The flavor of the sauce is really yummy and I also added a little bit of BBQ sauce as the men in my family put it on everything!
I must mention that I also didn't use the bacon as we are vegan.
I will be making this again but I won't be using the different kinds of beans as that would turn of my teenage sons. 
Thanks for sharing...this is a keeper!

Everyone loved these beans. It calls for 3/4 cup ketchup and instead used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce. Added more bacon but otherwise didn't change a thing. Awesome, will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  Followed the recipe pretty closely, although I did use butter beans instead of garbanzo, and threw in an extra can of black beans just because I had them.  Cooked all day in the crockpot, and they were very good.  Like others, I tool the lid off for the last hour, and wished I hadn't ... They do thicken up as they cool down.  Even with the brown sugar and molasses, these were not overly sweet, which we liked.

Very good.  Followed the ingredients other than using Butter Beans instead of Garbanzo.  Also, put in my crock pot on low for about 3.5 hrs instead of heating up the oven.

great baked beans and everyone loves them and askes for the recipe , I did change the recipe a little because a friend cant eat onions so I added extra bacon and used some onion powder and taste good too. and one time I made them I grabbed a can of ranch beans and had them opened before I noticed so I said what the heck , so I traded them for the baked beans, makes it not as sweet and my husband liked them better that way . fixing to make some for a cookout this weekend

The beans were way to sweet for me as prepared.  I added more bacon and BBQ sauce to take the sweet edge off it.

Lots of compliments from the boys at the Christmas pot luck. Doubled the recipe and made it mostly by the recipe except I used 1 can of Garbanzo beans and 1 can of Black beans and substituted 1/2 the Ketchup with barbeque sauce. Also added 3 extra tablespoons of bacon grease to the pot. It's all about the flavor and I love bacon. It was a bit sweet for me and will cut the brown sugar by 1/2 next time I make it. This will certainly stay in my recipe box. Adding hamburger and/or bulk sausage to the mix is also an option.

This is the best baked beans I have ever had! We made them for a cookout that included hotdogs, hamburgers, marinated and grilled london broil and all the side dishes. All I heard about was the beans and they were gone in no time. I made them true to recipe with only one exception. I took the advice of another review and added 1/3 cup of bourbon (Evan Williams) Wouldnt make them any other way.
 Making a triple batch for a wedding this weekend.
 Cant recommend enough and is a lock for the family Christmas dinner.

I changed 2 things: I used 2 cans Bush's baked beans (one drained), and one can each drained kidney and butter beans). No garbanzo. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar, but no molasses. These were DELICIOUS and easy. I would definitely make them again!

Great recipe! I omitted the bacon because I wanted this to be vegetarian and just as suggested by another reviewer, I sautéed the onions and garlic and added with all the ingredients in the crockpot.

These beans had good flavor but were not the hit of the party, in fact I still have a good portion left over in my fridge. I followed the recipe exactly as written. My husband commented that he liked my usual beans better. Oh well, gotta break out of the norm sometimes. They are getting rave reviews, so try for yourself!

This is a great recipe and so easy! I followed as written, except for one thing. I put it in a slow cooker and cooked it on low for about 5-6 hours. The flavors melded together really well. This is a staple at any family function!

I never make beans, but my husband's family loves them.  These were great!  Used microwave bacon to save time and mess - just sauted my onions and garlic in butter instead.  Also used a can of black beans instead of garbanzo.  Otherwise I stayed to the recipe.  Thank you!

Excellent! I made a vegetarian version of these, omiting the bacon and worcesteshire sauce. I couldn't find the beans listed here, so o I used navy beans and romano beans. It was super delicious! I served them with coleslaw and cornbread. Yummy!

Pretty good. Used kidney and romano beans and breakfast sausage instead of bacon. Added some hot sauce and chili powder to spice things up. Left in crockpot for 4 hours. Delish.

Love these. Next time we'll substitute butter beans for kidney. Huge and easy hit. (I don't bother w/ a fry pan. I nuke the bacon and put the onions in the baking dish raw. After an hour or so (you can't really over cook em) the oven w/ the beans, they are perfect. )

This is a GREAT recipe for baked beans, and is very EASY to make!  I liked the original recipe, but loved the recipe after a few modifications:  I used navy beans instead pinto beans and black beans instead of garbanzo beans.  The different colored beans make the dish look very appetizing, and the baked beans taste even better than they look.  Thank you for an easy and great-tasting recipe!

I used this recipe too many times to counts and every time I serve it people love it and always comment on it.  But I use 2x 16oz cans of Romania beans drained, 2x 16oz cans of baked beans (in molasses) and 1x 16oz can of red kidney beans drained in place of the beans listed because I can never find them.  I also add 2 tbsp of chili powder (to taste) and it makes a world of difference.  Trust me with the chili powder!

takes alot of ingredients but the end result is worth it. This dish was very good. Thick and rich. the next time I make it I'm going to try adding some BBQ sauce for a different taste. I added Butter Beans and they were the best, and I did not add Garbanzo beans. Great Dish!

Everyone loved these.  Put them in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on low.  I used a can of white beans instead of Northern because I couldn't find them. Will increase the bacon next time.

Superb flavour. Didn't have the variety of beans the recipe required but that didn't matter.  This recipe would work well for any combination.  Makes lots. Won't even think about looking for another recipe for baked beans. Don't think I could improve on it.

This is the best baked beans ever. I love the chick peas (garbanzo beans), they add some real texture. Too many baked beans are mushy, but not these. I have not made any adjustments with this recipe, it's pretty much golden the way it is now, and thats rare for me to leave one alone.

I did like Lisa, I put them in the crock pot and took the lid off the last half hour. I also added a package of diced sharp cheese right before serving.I'm not a big fan of baked beans, but these were great. I will make them again!!

Of all the bean recipes I've used this one is the one everyone asks for.  I haven't used garbanzo beans yet...pretty much any bean combo that I have works fine.  I have never baked them so far - usually either just cook on stove top or for a crowd use my crockpot.

I have made this a dozen times and it is great!  I don't use the garbanzos but use more pinto beans instead.  Great flavor and the different textures and flavors of the beans are unusual, attractive, and delicious!

These beans were amazing!!  I had never made homemade baked beans before--but this was so easy and soo soo good!  I took them to a b-day party and everyone was raving over them.  Definitely a great recipe. I was a little skeptical of the garbanzo beans in it but you didn't even really notice them.  Loved this recipe.

Have made this before, called "Calico Beans".  Got the recipe from friends who make it when camping, in a dutch oven.  We make it in the Crock-Pot for Superbowl Sunday - cornbread is an excellent side dish.  My toddler loves it.

This sure looks like the best. I am allergic to pintos and garbanzos...happy to know about the idea of butterbeans...cannot wait to try it. One thing I might suggest is the addition of Mustard Seed. About 1 TBS (or more). It adds a great texture and "pop" as you chew, more than taste. I really reccomend this...try it, you'll like it!

These were very good. The sauce is yummy. I used all the beans that were suggested but would leave out the garbanzo beans next time...they just don't get soft enough!

These beans were very good.  I didn't used garbonzo rather than pinto beans and reserved 2 slices of bacon to put on the top.  I covered them until last 30 minutes and then baked uncoverd to firm up.

This was a really yummy baked beans recipe! I made it for a birthday BBQ and the entire pan was gone. Be sure to substitute a mix of your favorite beans. I used pork n'beans, ranch style beans, pinto and kidney. Definitely a keeper!

Although everyone liked these very much, I am not much of a baked bean fan.  They were good enough, but I like more of a kick, like a vinegary taste to baked beans; these were on the sweeter side.  I rated them more on the response of my baked bean loving family members and the fact that they were pretty easy, looked nice (I used butter beans instead of garbanzo...I like butter beans better), and tasted pretty good in general.  I cooked them in a crock pot on low for 8 hours, worked great.

These were great! I used a 2nd can of baked beans instead of garbanzos, and I omitted the molasses because I didn't have any on hand. They were a little sweet but I got lots of compliments from my guests!

I have made this twice now and it has become a favorite at my BBQ's.  The only problem is that I can only make it when I am having compay...it makes a lot and it is hard to cut the recipe in half.

This kids and I loved it. It was very similar to what my Mom used to make on the 4th of July. I used dried onions and garlic powder in place of the fresh onion and garlic, I didn't have all the different beans so I just used 3 cans pork and beans, 1 can kidney beans, and 1 can great northern beans. I also used precooked bacon. I also cooked it longer than 1 hour (it could be because I still had some liquid from the canned beans) Very delicious!

Excellent!  Loved the different textures of the beans.  I really should have halved this recipe though.  I made it for 6 and it was still way too much - don't know what I was thinking?!

Very flavorful and have the right texture.  Only complaint is the garbanzo beans didn't thoroughly cook, and in general are harder than the other bean types.  This resulted in semi-hard beans admist otherwise "al dente" beans.  Some may like this, but if not, you may want to pre-microwave your garbanzo beans.

Followed the recipe as written, except substituted black beans for the garbanzo beans as others suggested. It was delicious! The only complaint was the beans were a bit too hard. I will cook them longer next time.

Awesome!  I made these for a BBQ last weekend with my sister and her husband and everyone loved them.  I've been told that I must make these again soon and I agree,  they were wonderful.  I made them exactly at the directions state and the only mistake I made was I thought it looked a little soupy at the end of cooking time so I uncovered it and let it bake uncovered to reduce the liquid a little bit.  Next time I won't do that,  they turned out just a little too dry after I did that and we agreed they would have been even better if they had been juicier.  All in all a great recipe!

I've been anxious to get my hands on this recipe, Kelly, thank you so much! There's a  barbecue restaurant in my hometown that makes these and I've always loved them. I made them this past weekend for a party and they were a huge hit. I'm not a big meat-eater (especially pork), so I could do without the bacon in this recipe -- but for those that might want to try it, the restaurant that makes these uses shredded pork. Also, I followed the advice of a lot of reviewers and used black beans instead of garbanzo beans, which I think made them better. Try these beans if you haven't already...you won't be sorry you did!

Made these for a family reunion. I may have added more Worchestershire sauce than it called for, honestly I didn't measure any of the ingredients. A little confession...I NEVER measure. Anyway, they were fabulous. This is the second time I have made these, this time on request. The first time I used dried beans, but didn't cook them long enough. This time, I used dried again, but made sure they were cooked enough. I really like the flavor of these beans. Thanks!

The beans were wonderful.  Cooked them overnight (on low) in a crock pot, turned out great.

My father is diabetic, so I cut out the sugar completely, and reduced the molasses to 1 1/2 tbsp but the recipe still came out great, and everyone said they tasted sweet.  I also put them on very low heat in my crockpot for about 3 hours instead of baking them, and they came out perfectly.

This recipe is delicious.  I only used half of the molasses and put a little more brown sugar.  It's a very tasty blend of beans.  I'll serve these at BBQ's from now on...thanks Pat!

This was my first attempt at baked beans and they were great! I made no changes, but this is one where you could add/omit things as you please to meet your tastes. Will definitely make again with some of my own additions and will try in the crockpot! Thanks!

I have made this recipe for every get together that my family has had so far this summer and it has been a hit each and every time. I did however change just a few things, first I subbed a different type of bean for the garbanza beans, I've used a different one each time and they were all great. I also used the OM microwave bacon instead of raw because I hate chewy pieces of bacon in things. I also used a spicy brown mustard. Otherwise it all stayed the same and turned out great each time.

I really loved this recipe!  I added more bacon.  Next time, I probably will substitute a softer bean for the garbanzo beans as they seemed a little too firm for this dish.

I made these for a BBQ on the 4th and they were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the garbanzo beans and used a larger can of baked beans.  I wasn't too sure about adding the molasses but since I already had it, I decided to go ahead and use it.  I had several requests for the recipe and one of the guests begged to take the leftovers home.  This will now be my recipe of choice for baked beans - thanks for sharing!

These are excellent!  Made them for a BBQ, and even the non-baked bean eaters liked them!  Made a few modification:  Didn't use garbanzo beans, used Bush's Original Baked Beans instead.  Reduced molasses to 1/4 c., and added 1/2 c. BBQ sauce, and 1/4 c. ketchup, used 3 large cloves garlic.  Also increased bacon to 3/4 lb think cut bacon.   Put everything in the crockpot...cooked on low for 6 hrs, took the lid off to allow thickening and cooked on high for 1 hr.  It was PERFECT!

Outstanding beans.  Didn't use the garbanzo beans at all. Doubled the recipe but used 4 cans of the baked beans. After cooking the bacon, onion, & garlic I mixed all ingredients together then cooked in a slow cooker for 4 hours. Made enough for two different parties and everyone loved it.

I made these beans for my daughter's wedding reception and they were a real hit!  I received many compliments and was asked many times for the recipe.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing, and I'll do the same next time I make the beans-there is no need for any modifications.

I was looking for a new bean recipe to bring to potlucks and family gatherings.  This is it!  I doubled the recipe and substituted another can of pinto beans instead of two cans of  garbanzo beans. Next time I'll follow the recipe.  The garbanzo beans added a nice crunchy texture to the beans.

Really good and easy! I left out the garbanzo beans, because they just didn't sound right in a baked bean recipe? Added a touch of BBQ sauce and I also cooked in a crock pot for time restraint, and they were great!

I skipped the bacon (gasp!) and threw this recipe in the crockpot and it turned out wonderful.  The whiteness of the garbanzo beans makes it interesting...intriguing? scary?  I guess you either love 'em or you hate 'em.  I thought it was a nice touch.

Very good. Next time I will add more bacon and some chopped red pepper. I also didn't have all of the different beans so I only used regular beans and kidney beans. Next time I make it I am just going to stick with those two types because it came out great.

Worked out wonderfully, great visually--I got called out on the use of ketchup by some ingredient-conscious eaters.  I loved it though, and so did everyone else! Makes a lot.

I thought these were really good.  My husband's first words were, "These are awesome!"  They are comparable to a BBQ restaurant's beans in our town, which closed down so we can't get them anymore.

I made a few changes due to what we had on hand:  2 cans baked beans (pork & beans) instead of pinto and garbanzo, I used 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of 1/2 cup molasses, and we were out of onion.

Fantastic!  I love the variety of beans and textures.  The flavor is right on, too - not bland like so many baked beans recipes, but not too much, either.  I took this to a picnic where we arrived late.  Because many people had already been through the food line, I was afraid I'd be taking most of this home with me.  Instead, word got out how good these were, and I took home a container scraped empty.  The one thing I did differently (for better picnic transport) was cooking it in a slow cooker.  I cooked it on high a few hours (maybe 2.5) and then reduced it to low to keep it warm during the picnic.  Excellent.

I made these beans for a family picnic last weekend, and received a lot of compliments!  I did not use the pinto beans or garbanzo, but did use black beans and cannelini beans instead, as well as the others listed.  I only used 1/4 molasses and then used 1/4 real maple syrup because of what some of the other reviews had said.  I really think they came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making them again.

I made this for a cookout and it was raved about! Really a great and easy recipe. I forgot to cover the beans for the first 1/2 hour they were in the oven so the top got a little crunchy but these were still excellent!

I am a MAJOR bean/legume lover [so long as they are NOT garbanzos/chic peas, green beans (regardless of how they are sliced, prepared or presented), or black-eyed peas].

At the same time, it is rare that one comes across a recipe that makes 1 husband and 2 older teens not only go back for seconds but actually ASK about when Mom may be making "that BEAN thing" any time soon!

THIS IS SUCH A RECIPE!
[I'm convinced that it's all about the brown SUGAR! But the (dark) MOLASSAS may have helped, too (:{]

*****

I liked that another reviewer suggested substituting Black Beans for the Garbanzos. I have not yet been so bold; rather, I opted to add a can of Cannellini (a white kidney) instead. Not only did no one complain, but the RAVES were actually gratifying! 

NOTE: I used CANNED beans my 1st time around (as the recipe called for) but I am VERY curious as to how the same combination of beans will taste if I begin with a "dried" variety and process them via my crock pot.

*****

We are very much "cheese people". I think that when I make this again (soon), I will attempt to melt some cheese (whether American, Velveeta, PepperJack or PepperJack/Colby) into it. 
I'm also thinking of using pork ribs or chops (rather than bacon) and adding GARLIC (a staple in my home) in the future.

I guess I'll just have to come back and let you know how THAT turns out.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it for 2 different large groups (doubled and tripled the recipe)and have been asked for the recipe several times.  It is a crowd pleaser and easy to make in large quantities.

I wasn't a huge fan, but my husband liked this and so did the woman hosting the party I brought the beans to.  It does make a lot, so I'll probably save this for big occassions and not make it for just the two of us.

This recipe was great. I did substitute black beans for pinto and 1 lb of ground beef instead of bacon and cooked in a slow cooker instead of the oven. Also I added a little cayenne pepper and chili powder for a little bite. I will for sure make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly and thought they were delicious.  I didn't think they were too sweet. The variety of beans was a nice change from plain old baked beans.  I didn't think you could single out a bean flavor like the garbanzos - they just blended nicely. i would definitely make again for a crowd.  thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is Terrific!!  I doubled the recipe for our family Easter dinner.  Was a bit afraid of the garbanzos -- but, went with the whole recipe as is.

Tremendous flavors, colors and taste over all.

Men, women teenagers - both boys and girls loved it!

Can't say more than that......give it a try.
