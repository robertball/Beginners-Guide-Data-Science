Great!  I don't like goat cheese, so I used blue cheese instead.  Nice, simple, healthy salad.

I thought this was wonderful.  Next time I think I might double the dressing, but other than that, I made it just as written.  Tasted just like my favorite salad at a local restaurant!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Instead of beef tenderloin we used port tenderloin. We also used the honey mustard recipe from the Aussie chicken recipe from the site. This salad is beautiful and it taste great as well. Will be recommending and making again. Thanks
