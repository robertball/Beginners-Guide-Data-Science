I made this recipe in my regular oven since I don't have a bread machine.  I mixed the starter, water, oil, honey and yeast in the bowl of my mixer and let it sit for about ten minutes to give the yeast a chance to activate.  Then I added in the flours and the salt and mixed for a few minutes then kneaded it by hand for a few minutes.  I let it rest for about an hour, punched it down and put it in a bread pan and let it rise for another 45 minutes.  After that I baked it at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.  The bread had a wonderful subtle honey taste... would be good with some honey butter.

I made this recipe on my bread machine and in the oven, the result was awesome.  I did modify a couple of ingredients and it still turned out wonderful.  I modified the water to 3/4 cup, 3 tbsp. honey, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup wheat flour, 2 tsp. rapid rise yeast and 3 spoonfuls of quick oats.  The result is a great tasting, chewy, kinda sweet loaf of bread.  It's great for french toast, grilled cheese, sandwiches, or just plain buttered.

I've been making bread for a while, but I am new to making sourdough. This was my third try and it is one of the best recipes EVER, not just among my sourdough tries. It slices perfectly. Not too crunchy, not too soft. Great recipe!! I am saving this one!

It took a while to rise because I used all purpose flour, but the end result is delicious!  This is very easy to slice thinly without crumbling!

I make my bread mostly wheat, so I added 2 cups whole wheat with 1 cup bread flour. It started looking too dry so I added more olive oil & warm water. Finished on the counter & in oven. It's delish. Made some of the best toasted sandwich bread we've had. Thanks!

I made this manually and used a sourdough starter I had on hand. Bread is slightly chewy & has a good flavor but needs a tad more salt. I like the addition of honey to the sourdough but might use 1 T instead of 2 next time.

This bread is so good.  I selected the dough cycle on my bread machine, then took it out, divided it into three equal balls to make smaller loaves for my family.  Then I let it rise again for about an hour, and baked in the oven for 15 minutes.  It turned out well, but I think next time I will try it without the additional yeast, because it ended up rising a lot.  thanks for another great recipe to use with my starter:)

nothing extrodinary. but good! only change was that I did NOT finish in bread maker- I don't much care for the crust.   I have saved this and will use it as a white bread option as it is not as sourdoughy as I had imagined... still looking for a strong sour loaf...  thanks for sharing!

This by far is the best sourdough recipe I have tried. The only thing I did different was I used regular unbleached whole wheat flour and all purpose flour instead of bread flour. I also added about 2 Tablespoons of Flax seeds.

Excellent texture, appearance and taste. Thin crust with an interior a little more soft than chewy. Didn't need to adjust water or flour once mixing. Worked great even though my starter was only 1 week old.

I've made this several times, not a very sour sourdough, but has excellent soft texture.

This was the first loaf I made with my new sourdough starter.  I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and added three tablespoons of oats as one reviewer suggested.  I love the bread machine but hate the dough hook hole it leaves in my loaves.  I set my bread machine for the dough setting and just made the doughball in the bread machine.  Then I transfered the dough to greased loaf pan and allowed it to rise in a warm place for one more hour until about doubled in size..  Then I baked it at 350F for 35 minutes.

I made this recipe today. I used the dough cycle and then shaped the dough into 2 smaller loaves. The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used 1/4 cup of honey and a scant teaspoon of sea salt. This recipe baked up beautifully. The best sourdough bread recipe I have tried. Thanks for sharing.

Great bread! Always love making this simple bread. I did as others an added a little extra honey and quick oats. I really enjoy the smells of the sour dough starter wafting thrushes house in the earl morning when I wake. The texture of this bread is wonderfully squeezable and the taste is old world for sure.

My loaf did not turn out with much sour dough flavor but that could be my starter. Otherwise the bread is soft and tasty.
Makes small loaf. Use 1.5 lb bread maker setting.

This bread's tasty and plenty sour with my starter.  I set my bread machine on the dough setting, split the completed dough in half, put those halves in small loaf pans in a warm place for an hour, and then baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  My little loaves didn't rise as much as I'd have liked, and the crust is a little thick (maybe 25 minutes next time), but still -- a nice flavor.

I made this bread using a "young" sourdough starter that I'm trying to nurture.  I used all white flour (all purpose) and only 3/4 tsp of yeast as I wanted to see how my sourdough made out with a little less yeast. I then threw it all into the bread machine on the Whole Wheat setting and went to work.  This bread came out awesome!  I will definitely make it again and will continue to see how much yeast I can eliminate and have my sourdough starter do the work.
