I love this Jam!! it worked just fine for me after the 4 hours in the crock pot I let it sit out and cool in jars and it hardened just fine for me. I had so much I gave a jar to a friend.

Used a 4 quart slow cooker; was barely sufficient. Also, though I followed the recipe carefully, it didn't thicken. The lemon juice made the flavor bitter, so we're going to have to sweeten 4 quarts of ice cream topping with more sugar! I'm going back to the stove-top Sure-Jell recipe. No stars.

Mine did not thicken. It's sitting on the counter now and I plan on letting it sit overnight to see if it thickens at all. As of right now, I have chunky strawberry pancake syrup.

Perhaps I did not get the ingredient ratios right but seems like way too much sugar. It didn't thicken. I used whole, instead of crushed, strawberries. That could be the reason.

Unfortunately, after all the preparation and four hours in the slow cooker, this left me with strawberry soup. I ended up putting it on the stovetop and simmering it for another hour until it gelled properly.

I just finished making this jam and won't make it this way again.  I'll stick with the regular method.
