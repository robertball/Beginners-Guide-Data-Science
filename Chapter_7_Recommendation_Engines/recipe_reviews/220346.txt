I have had a lapband for several years.  It makes it impossible to enjoy lasagne as it gets stuck.  This recipe which I made last night, with one small deviation, is the answer to my prayers for a great "lasagne.".  The eggplant makes a wonderful substitute for lasagne noodles.   I added a palmful of Italian seasoning.  Shredded Parmesan cheese to top of the richness.  The recipe is a wonderful base recipe.  We didn't miss the noodles at all.  This is great for gluten free diets also.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made lasagne many times but this is the first time I added eggplant.  I made the recipe exactly as written and this was delicious.

I made a few changes.  I used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of canned tomatoes to get more flavor.  I used the same amount of sauce as I would have used in tomatoes.  It needed more sauce (as someone else also mentioned).  So I had to add more.  The other change I made was to use a different shredded cheese.  I opted for an Italian 5 cheese blend as husband doesn't care for cheddar.  It was a nice lasagna.  However, the eggplant did not get cooked. (even with increasing the cooking time) I sliced it thin too.  Next time I may either cube it and cook with the beef and sauce, or may pan fry it slightly before baking.

No pasta!!  The whole point of making eggplant lasagna is to eliminate the pasta.  Believe me, it is delicious!  I grill the 1/4" slices of eggplant before I place them in the dish.

changes made: replaced noodles completely with eggplant.  left out mushrooms (only because i let them go bad.  i confess.) doubled fresh garlic.  replaced ground beef with ground sausage.  all VERY good.  i DO recommend using the sauce as directed - it's so easy and way better than jar sauce.

Ditch the noodles, increase the eggplant and don't bother peeling them. Use young tender eggplant and enjoy the benefits of the phenolic compounds in the peel. Lightly grill eggplant slices in a small amount of extra virgin olive oil if you want before adding. No cheddar please. Italian blend or mozzarella, provolone, and parmesan used together are wonderful.

Very good!  I did not add noodles and I added an Italian 6 cheese blend of cheese Instead of the cheddar. Oh and slice up your eggplant and drizzle olive oil and sea salt over it  then broil for 5-10 minutes before you assemble the dish so it's not raw.

I found this recipe when I was looking for a tasty lasagna( I don't like regular lasagna ). Right off from the first time I loved this recipe. ( I did not use the regular noodles because I just assumed to use the eggplant. And have ever since). I have on different occasions used ground turkey, chicken sausage, ground pork,different cheeses...etc. my point is this is a great recipe to do a lot of different things or just stick with the basics, they are all good. Bethany, thank you for sharing. My family and I love it!

Very easy and good use for summer veggies.  I also omitted the lasagna noodles to improve the carb situation.  Like another reviewer also used some tomato sauce and some fresh tomatoes to give it a little richness and I added in some yellow pepper because I had so many.  I also didn't bother with the layers of eggplant.  I just diced them up and sautéed them with everything else (okay strictly speaking this would not really be lasagna, but it simplified the whole thing!).  We enjoyed it and will make a again, though my DH and I thought we would add a little crushed red pepper next time to give it some umpf.

Made this for the first time today, it is a really great dish and I will be making this many Sunday nights so I can have leftovers for work. I substituted fresh garlic with roasted garlic puree and didn't peel the eggplant, everything else I kept the same as the recipe calls for. I baked it uncovered and when it was done I let it sit for 10 minutes before serving.

I made it according to the direction but I made a little changes that definitely made a huge difference with the flavor! I slightly browned the garlic and onions and used tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes, I fried the eggplant first, browned both side. It made it more flavorful and not watery. Before serving, garnish it with parsley! it is absolutely delish! good luck guys!

Very good. Used double the ground beef and 1/2 the crushed tomatoes. Substituted the other 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with spaghetti sauce. Then used even more spaghetti sauce, to taste. We like our lasagna saucy. We have had it as directed and found it to be a bit too dry.

Outstanding recipe with or without the lasagne noodles.Eggplant and mushrooms are a wonderful taste combination.  I used Cheddar and Asiago cheese because that's what was handy.

If you love eggplant parm but want a healthier version, this is it. Add more tomato sauce to recipe.

I also omitted the noodles, used 2 lbs of ground beef, 8 oz of mushrooms and 5 cloves of garlic. Same amount of tomato, but three cups of mozzarella, and grilled the eggplant. 
Added only salt and pepper, but would add oregano, or italian spice mix next time. We both loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this recipe but did make some alterations. I first cut the eggplant in half and boiled it until semi-soft then removed the pulp. I cut it up into cubes, used spiral pasta we had, used a whole container of mushrooms, 2 jars chunky spicy marina, and added italian seasoning. Mixed it all up and put in casserole dish with mozzarella on top.  Baked it and it came out awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

Really good! I used a jar of pasta sauce and one can of tomatoes and next time I’ll use both cans. I don’t see how there’s a way to make this without a jar, it’s just not enough sauce. I only had 7 noodles and a small eggplant too. I love that this doesn’t have cottage cheese or ricotta. I could use dairy free mozzarella and my daughter could eat a big serving. Also, I used one pound of meat. I definitely could make this for company, it makes good size servings.

This recipe has problems with proportions and temperatures.  A half pound of ground beef is not sufficient for a lasagna of this size.  Also, following the directions, there was not enough cheese or sauce to sufficiently cover the lasagna layers.  I added more.  And unfortunately I followed the directions for 40 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees.  At this temp and time, the top layer of my lasagna had hardened and was not edible.

I love my CSA and eggplant is plentiful at this time.  I used ground pork with Italian seasonings and spinach lasagna noodles.  It was delicious.  Quick and easy and definitely a keeper.  PINNED!

I made as directed, but added basil, oregano, garlic, and my secret spice ;) and I think I could have used some tomato paste, but I also used three cheeses. Grating the cheese was the only thing I can say that I didn't enjoy.

I read the reviews & left the pasta out & used jarred spaghetti sauce.   If I owned a grill I definitely would've grilled the eggplant first. I used twice the mushrooms because we as a family LOVE 'em.  Great recipe, amazing with my alterations!!  Happy Cooking!!

Super yummy!!! Wasn't wxpecting it to taste as good as it did. Only difference is I  stir fried the eggplant on a pan with Pam to soften it up a little but otherwise followed the recipe. Super yummy!!!

I made this recipe step by step for dinner last night.  Unfortunately I found this recipe lacking.  I felt the recipe was tasteless and dry.  One the bright side a nice glass of wine was able to enhance the meal!   Sorry........

This was edible but soooooo bland! Even my daughter who loves eggplant didn't care much for this recipe. I took the leftovers and added more spices and garlic and a bit more cheese and it was much better. Not one I'll make again.
