This is similar to a drink my mother used to enjoy.  I remember her sipping it in the evenings.  She kept it in a little tin on the kitchen counter.  I made it a few years ago, but unfortunately lost the recipe.  Our version was a little different.  I mixed one container of lemon sweetened instant tea with one container of orange breakfast drink (Tang).  I used generic for both.  I added 1 teaspoon of allspice and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also added 2 little tubs of sugar free lemonade (Crystal Light).  I even added 1/3 cup of Splenda.  I mixed it all in a gallon freezer bag, then used a funnel to pour it back into the plastic tea and orange drink containers.  (Careful, it creates a lot of powder in the air!)  I then heated 2 cups of water for a few minutes in the microwave and added 2 tablespoons of the mix.  It was a bit bland, so I tried 3 tablespoons and it tasted just about right.  With some experimentation, this is a delicious drink.  I prefer the half tea/half Tang version, with a little spice added in.  See what you like.  It's perfect as a small Christmas gift for coworkers, neighbors, etc.  Great with a tin of Christmas treats.  Enjoy!

This mix is wonderful and soothing in the winter.  I usually double the quantities so I can keep one and give one away.  I find that 2 teaspoons per cup of water is too weak, but that's the nice thing about this mix... just add a little more until you figure out what ratio tastes best to you.
