We tried this Scotch Eggs recipe because it doesn't require frying.  The eggs tasted great, but the cooking directions required some modifications.  At 20 minutes the sausage wasn't yet cooked, so we turned the oven up to 375, but after another 10 minutes they still weren't browning.  We sprayed some non-stick cooking spray on them, baked them a while longer, and when the sausage tested as done, we put them under the broiler for a short while to brown them.  They're not something you'd make all the time, but they do have a fun presentation, and these are probably a bit healthier than the traditional recipe since they're not fried.

I don't like scotch eggs but I use the meat mixture from this recipe to make English style sausage roll. Instead of wrapping the meat mixture around the eggs I wrap the meat in puff pastry and bake for approx 30 min.
