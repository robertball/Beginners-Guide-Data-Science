The Russian salad dressing in this recipe really gave the chicken a brilliant shade of orange. Plus I used peach preserves in place of apricot and that must have added to the orangy color. It had the appearance of being very spicy but really this has a very sweet flavor.  Nothing spicy or sour at all. I cut the chicken into bite size pieced before baking it and reduced the cooking time. I added a little corn starch to the sauce when it came out of the oven to thicken it up and served over rice.

I used 1/2 bottle of Russian salad dressing and 1/2 bottle of apricot preserves. I used an 8x8 Pyrex glass casserole and whisked the 2 ingredients together.  Put chicken in baking dish and turned it over to get coating mixture on both sides.  Cooked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  It was moist, tender, and delicious chicken.  I intend to try the Russian dressing with peach preserves next time to see how it tastes.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe. My family and I didn't care for the onion soup mix flavor. So the next time I omitted the soup mix and added about 3/4 cup of pickle relish. I also use peach  jelly and cut the chicken into bite size pieces and serve over rice. It's a family favorite. Glad I found this recipe
