4.17.17  Didn't have any purslane (honestly, wouldn't even know where to get it), but I did throw in a little watercress which I had on hand just to get a second green into the salad.  This was a nice luncheon salad, dressing was spot on, nothing not to like here.

I made this last night to accompany my lamb souvlaki, and it was wonderful together! Really great salad with great Greek flavors. Will make again!

We made this salad, along with some other Greek food for company.  They loved this salad and we did too.  The dressing is perfect and all the flavors come together beautifully.  I think we'll be having this salad often.
