Although there have been almost 100 rave reviews, I felt the need to add to the list!  I make these lil' smokies for every function and gathering.  People may even ask to make sure I am bringing them.  They are a fantastic little snack that are just as good cooled off as they are right out of the oven.  I definitely take the advice of others, and totally smother the bacon wrapped smokies with brown sugar...the more the better.  I have found that they turn out perfect when I wrap them up the night before, put them in a covered bowl with the brown sugar, toss well, and let "marinate" all night.  Then, covering them with all of the sauce they've created, I bake them for an extended time until crisp.  Not being surprised if they take 45 minutes.  The bacon must be crisp for my taste.  It's even better if midway, you turn them.  You won't be disappointed with all of the compliments you'll receive.

This recipe is perfect for the slow cooker...just wrap the smokies, and layer in the pot.  Once I get two layers in, I add a thin layer of brown sugar and continue with a layer of smokies and brown sugar until I run out of smokies or run out of room!  Just let them cook for a few hours and you're all set.

Awesome! A big mess to make and worth every single bit of it. Definitely use a broiling pan with slits so the fat and suagr can drip through and away from the sausages, otherwise you'll have a greasy, soppy mess. I used center cut bacon as someone suggested..I used 3 lbs. of the bacon for 2 pkgs. of the Lit'l Smokies, cutting each piece of bacon in half (crosswise). I dredged the bacon in brown sugar before rolling it around the sausage, then put the rolls in a ziploc bag with more brown sugar coating all of them (as suggested.) They sat in the fridge all day and were soaked in syrup when I went to broil them . I broiled on the center rack of my electric oven for 10 to 12 minutes on each side (til browned and crispy), sprinkling with more brown sugar after turning. I've never seen anything I've made disappear so fast. Served with the dipping sauce someone else suggested-1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup red chili sauce, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar...it's perfect with them. The sauce needs to be mixed well ahead of time for sugar to melt and flavors to meld. Absolutely delicious appetizer! Try it for your next gathering!! (P.S., I thought these were more of a 'manly' appetizer, but they were equally popular withe the women.)

If you want a WOW recipe ~ THIS IS THE ONE!  Salty, Sweet and Savory ~ Men absolutely love it!  I've made them 4 times now and they are always the first to go at a party.  I only write this review (it has enough positives already!) because I found a way to make the cooking time go faster, produce less mess and get more sugar to "stick".  I cut the bacon into thirds (too much bacon makes the outside crisp but the inside still undercooked) , dredge both bacon and smokies in the sugar to marinate (per advice of other reviewers), set them on a large plate with paper towels underneath and microwave them for approximately 1 min 30 secs, checking on them at every 30 sec. interval.  After this, I switch the smokies into a pan and bake in the oven for 5 min and then, after sprinkling another layer of brown sugar, I broil for 4 or 5 min.  The microwaving does the initial cooking and crisping of the bacon, but more importantly, catches all the fat that makes them greasy and tends to melt off the sugar.  The additional cooking finishes off the baking and crisping and then the additional sugar and broiling produces that carmelized glaze.  I also find that I don't need the toothpicks ~ I just stretch the bacon around and it sticks to itself.  Enjoy!  They're totally worth the fuss! and Thank You TINA!!!

Simple, tasty recipe.  To solve the brown sugar dilemma, I put about 2/3 cup of brown sugar in a mixing bowl, and rolled each smokie/bacon piece in it before placing it on a broiler pan, which I then put in the oven.  Using a broiler pan allowed the fat to drain off while baking.  It worked well, and each bite got it's share of the brown sugar glaze.

I've made these several times now and they've always been a big hit. I've modified the recipe a bit. I don't even use the skewers. I lay several slices of bacon on top of each other, slice them into one or one and a half inch pieces and wrap a piece around the smokie. Then, I sprinkle them all with brown sugar. (I sprinkle them about three times total during the cooking time....I like them better with more sugar than the recipe states.) I broil them for about 15 minutes or until bacon is crisp (center rack). Thank you so much for sharing the recipe Tina! I'll use this one for my Superbowl party and for many parties to come!

These were incredible!  To make things easy, I cut the bacon into 2 pieces (I used center cut bacon). Then I shook the smokies and bacon in ziploc bags with brown sugar.  I assembled them, put them on a broiler tray and refrigerated them overnight.  Before I popped them in the oven the next day, I sprinkled more brown sugar on them.  After baking about 1 hour, they were crispy and delicious!

These are FANTASTIC I've been asked to make several times! I roll the bacon wrapped smokies in brown sugar, use toothpicks instead of skewers, bake on a foil lined jelly roll pan, and then stagger in a crock pot to keep warm while the party lasts! Definitely a Keeper! Thanks Tina!

These were very good.  I wrapped them in bacon and COVERED them in brown sugar the night before, as others suggested.  I put on more brown sugar then baked (had to broil to crisp bacon) and kept warm in crock pot.  Next time I will use center cut bacon.  Too much fat on my brand.

Ok, I've made this a few times now and after reading allot of reviews and making it myself here's the best way I see to make 'em. I do suggest as others to:
i use regular bacon cut into 3rds. we use blue ribbon thick cut bacon. if you used centercut you'd probably have to cut in half.
roll both bacon and cocktail weinies in dark brown sugar. i prefer skewering them as apposed to toothpicks. and doing this the day before to let them marinade is preferable. 
One thing I do not agree with is using the liquid drippins that the marinde makes to pour over right before cooking because since it is already liquid it just goes straight to the bottom of the sheet. I just prefer to sprinkle a final round of brown sugar on before cooking.
As for pans, while a broiler pan did work. What I found worked better was a large shallow (short raised sides) sheet pan (13x15) and then a metal cooling rack to place in side. This method allowed more grease to drip to the bottom during cooking. I line the bottom of the pan with heavy duty foil. Cook for a good 45 minutes at the recommened teperature. Then I broiled for an add'l 10 minutes to get the bacon nice and crispy. This is where skewers come in handier than the toothpicks. When I made with the toothpicks I didn't flip and while the bottoms were cooked the bacon wasn't crispy. With the skewers however it is easy to flip halfway through the broiling. Then serve as is or remove and replace with toothpics. I keep them warm in a crockpot (using a lin

I made these for superbowl about an hour ahead of time, but they never made it to kikckoff, my husband had them eaten in about 10 minutes! Next time I will make a lot more! I added ALOT of extra brown sugar. I dipped the bacon in the sugar then rolled it around the sausage. I didn't need to secure them with anything, they stayed wrapped. I put them on a broiler pan (they make a lot of grease) and I also broiled the last 10 minutes to crisp them up good. Delicious!

If you broil these sugar-drenched bacon wrapped smokies for 15 minutes "per side" then all of the sugar (as well as the toothpicks) burn...therein setting off all smoke detectors in your house.  Stick to the original recipe and BAKE (at 350), not broil.

This was a huge hit as our annual Christmas party last night. The adults and children all kept going back for more. 

One note I wanted to add - I rolled the bacon and smokies in brown sugar prior to assembly as others suggested, but then I just skewered them and balanced the skewers across a 9x13 pan to bake them. All the fat dripped down into the pan for nice, crisy bacon, and the clean-up was no problem at all. Great recipe!

To make cooking and clean-up easier I use a foil lined cookie sheet. I put a Pam sprayed cooling rack over that and place the wrapped smokies on top in rows. Here's the tip. I put another Pam sprayed cooling rack on top of that so when time comes to flip the smokies I can do them all at the same time by flipping the racks. Of course hold tight to the racks when flipping.

This is a great recipe and there is little to no mess when you put the smokies on a rack(a cooling rack you use for cooling cookies from the oven) in an aluminum foil pan.  Throw the pan away after baking and voila...no mess.  I also don't use any skewers.  Just get a plate and pour some brown sugar in it.  Roll  the sausage in the brown sugar  and just place both sidesof the bacon in the brown sugar, roll up the sausage in the bacon place on the rack seam down and sprinkle any extra brown sugar over top. I bake at 425 for 20-25 minutes also to get the bacon crisp...huge crowd pleaser.  I would give this recipe a 10 star if I could for the ease of it.

Very good.  These were the first appetizer to disappear at the party.  I changed the cooking instructions based on the other reviews and mine turned out perfectly.  Here they are...soak toothpicks in water.  Dredge bacon and sausages in brown sugar then roll them up.  Microwave them for 1 min 30 sec on top of paper towels.  Transfer to a foil lined pan.  Cook at 350 for 5 minutes, turn over, broil for 5 minutes.  They were yummy and easy to make.

These are THE BEST! I buy whatever bacon is on sale, which isn't always center cut and this is what I do to make it nice and crispy.  First I "marinade" a ziptop bag of lil smokies and a ziptop bag of bacon strips cut into thirds in the brown sugar for 30 minutes.   Next, I assemble them on toothpicks and add them to a bowl, adding more layers of brown sugar after I fill each layer of the bowl. These go in the fridge overnight covered with foil.  The next day, I put these in a single layer, none touching any of the others, on a broiler pan. I put these in on 375 instead of 350 and after 30 minutes, I check them every 5 minutes until they're done to my satisfaction. Sometimes I do need to turn them to get the bacon to cook evenly.  Then I store in a crockpot on "warm" until I need to take them to the function I am attending.   Works like a charm every time, even without using center cut bacon!

These are wonderful snacks for sure. I do them the way a caterer friend of mine did. Place a layer of sliced bread in the pan first to soak up the grease, works very well.

I won a holiday party contest for best dish with this recipe. I did the following: cut regular bacon in half and trimmed the fat, dredged bacon in brown sugar, wrapped them and let them marinate overnight in ziplock bags, didn't bother with toothpicks b/c they held together on their own, placed them 1/4" apart on foil lined baking tray in rows, baked for 20 minutes each side, used a turkey baster to suck the fat up from the tray in between flipping. I also didn't bother with the skewers or crock pot. Be careful not to burn these b/c of the sugar. Broiling for a couple minutes after cooking seemed to almost burn them and isn't really necessary. Also, the dipping sauce people recommended made with mayo and chili sauce tasted weird to me. I didn't like it and no one ate it. I used 3 lbs. (packages) of bacon for 3 packs of sausages.

Perfection!  I've made these several times and just did another double batch for a party this afternoon.  I used hickory smoked bacon, and the aroma was lovely.  Please remember to follow the suggestions regarding the cooking on a rack.  I used a wire rack over a foil-lined cookie sheet.  If you cook directly on the cookie sheet, the brown sugar will burn onto the cookie sheet and the smokie itself - if it's on the rack, the smokie will happily roast away wrapped in it's little bacony coating safely away from burning sugar.  I also found that no toothpicks are needed as the bacon will shrink onto the smokie.  Dang, I'm hungry for a batch now!

I made these for Super Bowl 45. They were a great hit. They take some time to make, but they were worth it. I also used the "Bacon wrapped brown sugar smokies dipping sauce" from this site. Winning combination.

I have made these twice now and I think the key to this is to get the bacon crisp.  Based on the reviews, everyone seems to have their own way of achieving that.  Here’s my two cents.  First I cut my bacon strips in 4 pieces rather than 3.  I placed them seam side down on a jellyroll pan lined with non-stick foil, eliminating the need for toothpicks or skewers.  I think baking them for 30 minutes is plenty of time, otherwise they begin to shrivel up too much.  After 30 minutes, I drained the fat and then broiled these on the middle rack for about 2 1/2 minutes per side.  This time I served these with Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce, also from this site, which was a nice addition and not nearly as sweet as other sauces mentioned.  I also think these could be made ahead and frozen just before the broiling step, then thawed and broiled to reheat and crisp.  Both times I’ve made these not a single little Smokie remained on the serving plate!

Yup. They're that good. i dredged both bacon and lil smokies in brown sugar first, wrapped the bacon around each smokie (no need for skewers), microwaved for 7 mins, then transferred to a foil lined cookie sheet, covered in more brown sugar, then broiled for 5 mins. PERFECT! they didn't last 5 minutes!

Tips:  Use one toothpick per sausage, soak the toothpicks first!  Use fresh bacon and just before using it, put in freezer for 5-10 mins.  When the bacon is very cold, it holds itself together better. Dredge each peice of bacon in sugar, then wrap.  Bake before you leave the house.  When you arrive, put under broiler for 5 min, until warm and crisp!!!!!

my wife and I have been making these for years. My MIL actually had been making them for a while and that's how I heard about them. We've made these for MANY different events and they're always a real crowd pleaser.  Seems each time we make them now we have to add more and more. 
My Wife started to add cayenne pepper to the brown sugar before covering the wrapped smokies. For each single batch (1C brown sugar) we add approx 2 TSP cayenne pepper powder. Mix well into brown sugar and then cover bacon wrapped smokies.  Talk about a killer combo of sweet, crunchy, salty and a little kick of heat.

Be sure to bake these on a wire rack on top of the cookie sheet. Otherwise they will just sit in the grease and the bacon won't cook right. I did it both ways and the ones cooked on the rack are a million times crispier and better.

made 300 to 400 (good grief it could have been more) of these for a big party and we set it up like an assembly line and cussed these little devils the whole time BUT they were such a major hit we felt vindicated we had a little variation on the recipe that ours called for making them the night before and letting them sit in the fridge over night then we sprinkled a little more sugar on them before baking again you have to remember we had almost 9 cookie sheets of the little devils and cooking time was not pleaant!! we found that 2 trays took at leat an hour to cook and they need to be turned, we discovered toward the end that baking then turning the broiler on and WATCHING them and TURNING them really helped, but be forewarned make alot of these because they are AWSOME and everyone will not eat just one you need to make abunch, so being able to do it the night before does help just allow for plenty of cooking time and then throw in a crock pot  and there you have it ready for the party that night we later transferred the little devils from the crock pot to a chafing dish,worked perfect!! Hope this info helps someone out there, be sure and try them!!!!

This dish was a HUGE hit at 3 different holiday parties!I followed the original recipe step-by-step and was amazed at not only how easy it was but how delicious they turned out. I cut the bacon strips into thirds, dredged them in the brown sugar, rolled each piece around the sausage and used toothpicks to keep them wrapped. I then marinated them overnight to soak in all the sugar. I used a large roasting pan lined with foil to keep the clean up to a minimum and placed the rolled sausages on a cookie cooling rack. I baked them for 45 minutes at 350 and since they were elevated on the cooling  rack they cooked evenly so I didn't need to bother turning them over. Once they were done baking I simply transferred them to a serving dish and threw away the foil. I will definitely be making these again.

This was a VERY tasty appetizer however it took MUCH longer to cook than stated in the original recipe.  Hint - don't use any bacon that looks like a thick cut of bacon and use enough bacon to meet; don't overlap the bacon too much.  This only adds cooking time.  Additionally, I ended up broiling them for a minute or so after baking them and then had to turn each one over to cook the underside.  I did take the advise to line the pan with foil and "Pammed" the broiler rack so clean up was easy.  These were the new hit of the party, however, based on the time involved to cook them I'm not sure I'll be making them again next year!  Maybe it's my oven!!!

I made these a couple of times to try to get it right for my daughter's birthday party. The absolute best way to to this is to...cut the bacon into thirds or half, put a lot of brown sugar in a bowl and cover the bacon and sausages in it. Don't bother wrapping them yet. Just throw them all in a plastic bag and refrigerate over night. The next day, fry the pieces of bacon until they are about half way done and then wrap them over the sausage and secure with a toothpick. Place on a broiler pan and sprinkle with more brown sugar and bake at 350 for about 20-30 minutes. I made these yesterday for my daughter's party and they were a HIT! I kept them warm in a crockpot. Any other way I made these they were either too chewy or burnt.

Amazing. If you want something easy and inexpensive that people at the party will continue to talk about the day AFTER the party, this is it. I read other reviews and I ended up wrapping the bacon around the sausage and then letting them marinate in a freezer size ziplock bag full of a whole box (not 1 cup) of brown sugar. They take a while to cook, I wanted the bacon crispy and I flipped the skewers twice. I think it took about 45 or an hour to get them just right. Something I will do different next time is let them sit for about 15 minutes after they get out of the oven. They end up caramelizing themselves and people will keep saying they can't believe how many they ate. I'm glad I found this recipe! Thanks!

I took these to a late summer housewarming party and it was a hit.  Here are some tips from this recipe that worked for me that I got from other reviewers.  Roll the smokies the night before so that the brown sugar can really marinade in.  As well I made the dipping sauce of-1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup red chili sauce, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar...it's perfect with them.  This will definately be coming back at many other policy

Yummy!! I cut the bacon on half and wrapped each smokie in a half piece of bacon. I actually made these up and froze them for a week. The day of my cocktail party, I took them out of the freezer, baked them on a cookie sheet. I then drained each one with paper towels(makes a lot of bacon grease). I placed them in a baking pan and sprinkled them generously with the brown sugar and broiled them till the sugar melted. My company loved these!

OMG!  My #1 top appetizer!  I made these for Christmas 2011 when everyone was coming over (in addition to cheese dip, Costco Spinach/Artichoke dip and Trader Joe Jalapeno cheese)  I used two packages of Little Smokies and two pkgs of all natural bacon.  Cut each bacon strip in 3 pieces.  Didn't really take that long to wrap.  Did this the night before and put them all in a big plastic bag with a bunch of brown sugar and put all that in a bowl and refrigerated overnight.  Cooked the next day with the whole contents of the plastic bag plus extra brown sugar.  I did not have to turn them.  They went fast!

I altered the recipe just a bit. I chopped up the bacon and spread it over the wieners then sprinked the brown sugar over that. They were incredible! I will make these again and again and again.

These went extremely fast. It is best to toss the brown sugar, bacon, and sausages by hand in a bowl.

Once the bacon was wrapped around the sausages, I found it was easiest to place about five or six on a bamboo skewer. It makes it easier to turn and allows the bacon to cook more evenly.

I cooked these at 350* for about 20 minutes and then raised the heat to 400* until the bacon was fully crisp (another 15 mins or so).

I made a ton of these for my son's third birthday party and they were a huge hit with the adults.  I was worried I was going to have leftovers because I made such a huge amount, but not one was left on the plate.  I did take advice from some of the reviews such as: I wrapped them the night before the party and used toothpicks to keep them in place.  I placed them in large ziplock bags and sprinkled the sugar over them and let the juices coagulate in the fridge.  I baked mine in the oven using a drip pan.  They will drip a lot of grease.  I do recommend center cut bacon.  They were delicious!!  My friend already asked me for the recipe.  I will definately make these again for another party.

I have been making these for years!! They are a hit every time!! To avoid the mess and clean up I go to the local dollar store and I buy 2 disposable deep dish baking pans and buy 2 disposable cookie sheets (I put holes in this one with a knife for grease to drain into deeper dish) its so easy to throw it all away when your done!

I made a double batch of these for a party and they were gone in 20 minutes. Oh, it took longer to bake then I expected. I had to keep them in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes for the bacon to be cooked well.

This was fantastic!! After cutting up the bacon i rubbed them down with brown sugar and then wrapped them. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top of them before cooking. Also since i didn't have a broiling pan, i cut slits in an aluminum casserole pan to let the juices drain on to a cookie sheet underneath. It worked just fine ;) First time i've done these and will definently do them again!

I just made these....haven't had the party yet and they may not make it that long!  I figured I could bake them first, then place them on a glass serving plate and pop in the microwave right before serving.  I didn't use skewers...just used toothpicks.  Excellent blend of flavors.

I cut the bacon strips in half and dipped the bacon strips into a bowl of brown sugar to coat, then I wrapped them around the smokies.  No skewers were needed.  I had to bake them about 30-35 minutes due to cutting the bacon into halves and not thirds. Do line your pan with foil for easy clean-up. Delicious appetizer but very greasy!!

Ecellent appitizer.  Never last long enough to get cold.  I changed the recipe a little by using my brown sugar dry rub that I use for bar-b-que ribs.  The extra seasonings  really add another dimension to the smokies.  Never any left over and always wanting more.  Murph

I've been making this for years and it's always a huge hit.  I trim every piece of bacon in so that each smokie has about 90% meat and 10% fat.  Yes, time consuming, but worth the effort.  I dredge each piece of bacon in the brown sugar prior to wrapping them.  I put them on a foil liked cookie sheet, cover and put in the fridge over night.  I add additional brown sugar on top of the smokies prior to baking.  Watch them closely towards the end because you want them as done as possible, but not burned.  I do put a toothpick in each one because I put them all in a crockpot and they are easy to get out with the toothpick.  Delish!!!

This was amazing.  I took someone else's advice and layered the smokies in a crockpot, adding brown sugar every two layers.  I then cooked it on high for 2 hours.  After that, I put them on a cookie sheet and added a little more brown sugar, and baked them in the oven for 15 minutes, until the bacon was crisp.  I then flipped them and baked them an additional 15 minutes.  I drained the juice from the crockpot and put them back in and put it on low.  They were a huge hit!

These went just as fast as other reviewers mentioned. I used a broiling pan, and turned them half way. They cooked total for 45 minutes. Very crispy and no extra steps except turning them were necessary.

These were soooooo good. I was worried because I had to pre-make them then reheat at a work party the next day and I thought it would be soggy, but they were perfect! I made them as directed the night before. Then put the finished smokies in the fridge over night with another cup of brown sugar sprinkled on. Then the next morning put in the crock pot on low while at work. The office loved them so much that the smokies were gone before the party even started :)

I found these worked better if the brown sugar was between the bacon and sausage (less burning and more sweetness)

I made these yesterday for our holiday office party and they were the talk of the office!  I used many reviewers' suggestions.  I tripled the recipe.  I used pork (not beef) Lit'l Smokies and thick cut bacon.  The night before, I spread lots of brown sugar on a pan, coated both sides of the bacon, rolled the smokie, and secured with a toothpick.  I put all the wrapped smokies in a bowl to sit in the fridge overnight.  (Next time I will put them in a wider dish or Ziploc bag.  The sugar and bacon grease turned into a marinade, but only the bottom smokies were soaking in it.)  The next morning, I put them on a plate with lots of paper towels and microwaved them for 2 minutes.  Then I spread them on a broiler pan (I bought disposable ones from the grocery store).  I spooned the marinade over the smokies, and sprinkled some more sugar.  I started cooking them at 350, but then upped it to 375, then 400.  They baked about 35-40 minutes, and I flipped them once towards the end.  I would have liked them crisper, but I was running out of time.  I tossed them all in a crockpot and took them to work.  Next time, I will try wooden skewers.  It was very difficult to flip the sizzling smokies on toothpicks. I will use another reviewer's suggestion of baking them on skewers and then cutting the skewers into mini toothpicks to serve.

These little guys are ABSOLUTELY SCRUMPTIOUS!  I cut the bacon into thirds and sprinkled the brown sugar into a separate baking pan and then laid the bacon strips on top of the brown sugar, placed a smokie sausage on each bacon strip and rolled.  I secured with a toothpick. To the reviewer who advised lining the baking pan with foil - you are an angel (clean up was a breeze).  I baked for 25 minutes, drained them and arranged on a platter.  They were all consumed in about 3 minutes.  LOL Thank you Tina for sharing your recipe!!

Fantastic! I used alot more sugar,about 1 1/2 cups. One tsp. only covered 2 links. I put brown sugar in a bowl and packed it on my bacon,rolled and secured with toothpick(easy for guests to pick up) Sprinkled with additional sugar. Make sure you use foil. When they were done they had a wonderful caramelized glaze! I would suggest doubling this if you take to a party, just 3 of us ate almost the whole plate! Thanks Tina for sharing!

I love these and they are the first plate to be cleaned off at any function.  A tip that might make your life easier is after you wrap them in bacon, stick them on a wooden skewer!  You can fit 8-10 on a skewer and then place then on a jelly roll pan small enough so that when you place the skewer on it the little smokey is not sitting on the pan.  The grease just drips down.  When they are done cooking, take a serving fork and slide the fork from the top of the skewer to the bottom and they all come sliding off.  SUPER EASY!

Loved these!  Based on other reviews, I coated each piece of bacon & each smokie with brown sugar, then wrapped the smokie.  Placed them on a cooling rack inside a foil lined cookie sheet.  Baked them at 400 for about 45 minutes.  Came out perfect!  Easy clean-up, too!

ADD SOME BBQ SAUCE, AND EAT SOME FOR YOURSELF BEFORE THEY ARE ALL GONE!! These are great  the way they are, but I think they are a little better (and more like what the kiddos used to call "saucy hotdogs") when I put the little smokies in a big tupperware bowl, add some bbq sauce, shake them up, and then roll them in the bacon and add the brown sugar.  It's a little messier, but oh so worth it!  Also, like the others said, sticking the bacon in the freezer for 10 minutes is really helpful for the ease of cooking.    For the bacon, I like to get the Center Cut bacon (you can get the Hy-Vee brand for a reasonable price) and cut it in half for rolling.  I usually put two little smokie wraps per toothpick  Don't be afraid to get these extra crispy when you are baking them--it will help keep them a LITTLE crunchy when you stick them in a crock pot.  Overall, a wonderful recipe! Keeping people's tips in mind from the reviews will make your life a lot easier!

I served these at a party and the group went wild for them.  These were more popular than the gourmet cheeses and expensive wine.  Go figure.  When I made them, I put 5-6 on wooden skewers, then simply cut the skewers into mini-sized toothpicks when filling the round heated serving dish.  I have a convection oven and set it to convect-roast to ensure the bacon would brown.

I've used chicken/Apple sausage, chicken cubes, and the regular smokies.  Each are good.  In fact, people seem to like it when there are choices.    I have to update with some new information.  I have made these several hours in advance a few times and they actually turn out better.   The brown sugar may liquify, so be sure that they are really covered well.   Don't worry if you're making a lot, I have yet to ever have any left over.   They go over great with EVERYONE!

I roll them into the brown sugar to get them more evenly coated. Line baking sheet with foil for easier clean-up. I also used toothpicks to wrap and hold them individually (SO MUCH easier then putting them a skewer). Used broiler to crisp them up a little at the end.........Oh, and there are never any left when I bring them to parties :)

I took these to a super bowl party this year, they were gone in seconds! I wrapped the little smokies with bacon and put them on skewers then rolled the skewers in brown sugar. I broiled them until crispy on one side, flipped, then broiled the other side. They turned out crispy and delicious!

I took previous advice & put these on skewers; also, put them on my cookie cooling rack over a foil lined cookie sheet to bake and turned them several times.  Clean up was a breeze! I also wrapped half a piece of bacon around each instead of a third, my error.  Just more bacon flavor per yum! My husband thought the brown sugar was a bit too sweet.  I thought they were fine, but think I may try brushing on a honey/bourbon mixture or thick barbeque sauce for variation.  They stay together really well and mine had no toothpicks to hold them together after they were done.

I have made this recipe before, but I use a toothpick for each, because they are extremely hot when they come out of the oven, and they go fast!! Put a thick layer of foil on your pan before they go into the oven. Makes for easy cleanup. That brown sugar is difficult to get off once it is baked on.

Absolutely delicious! Made as a holiday appetizer and family loved them.  Next time I will double.  Also used much more brown sugar and broiled for a long time to crisp bacon (flipping over half way through to crisp all around) .  Can't wait to make again.

YUMMMMY!!!  That's all I have to say.  I took tips from other reviewers and used LOTS more brown sugar and let it soak in for awhile.  I let them bake and then stuck them on broil for a few min. to crisp up the bacon.  Will make again!!

These were a hit with all ! This recipe is bound to become a regular when preparing parties and entertaining. Cocktail weiners work best and the brown sugar realy adds a nice maple flavour. Goes well with dipping sauces.

Absolutely delicious!!! They are like candy to me. I melt a stick of butter, then slowly stir in the brown sugar until I have a sugary, buttery paste. Then I brush the mixture onto the bacon-wrapped smokies. This will ensure a nice coating of brown sugar glaze on each smokie. Enjoy!

I have made this receipe for over 16 years now. It is a recipe that my mom shared with me. No matter where I go people always ask if I am bringing these and my husband has had me make double batches because everyone fights over them. I add way more than 1 cup of borwn sugar and as many have already said....the more the better. You definitely will not go wrong with making these and trust me when people will request that you make them again and again. It is truly a VERY simple recipe and great for the beginner cook.

Pretty good.  Baking on a baking sheet the bacon gets soggy on one side.  I would recommend baking them on a wire rack so they don't sit in the grease the entire time they cook.

I've made them twice and every time people loved them! The first time I followed the recipe and they were amazing. The second time I added more brown sugar, this time to the inside of the bacon strip. Both times were so good. This is definitely a recipe I will continue to make. I'm drooling right now at the thought!

These were surprisingly yummy!!  I tried a different recipe that used butter & brown sugar & didn't care for it.  These were perfect.  I used center cut thin bacon & liberally coated the bacon wrapped smokies with the brown sugar and let them sit overnight.  It takes a while in the oven to get the bacon crisp, I've broiled them on low for the last few minutes to finish them up.  Definitely serve with the "bacon wrapped brown sugar smokies dipping sauce" from this site!  Oh, one last thing .... Use the smokies, not the beef cocktail franks, it makes the difference.

These are very good.  But, if you use wooden toothpicks it would be best to soak the toothpicks for a few minutes to make sure they don't get too hot.  It will help caramelize the brown sugar and make it so much easier!  :-)

I have the same basic recipe except with the addition of 1-2 tablespoons of molasses (mild or robust, depending on how flavorful you want them).  It strengthens the flavor.  There are never any left over!

I just made these and even though I had read all the 5 star reviews, I was really surprised how delicious they are. You will definitely want to double the batch! I will be making these again and again. I made the dipping sauce  also found on this site. Very simple, 1/4 c. mayo., 1/4 c. BBQ or chili sauce and 2 T. brown sugar. Perfect!!!

My mom used to make these and they are wondeful and easy.  However, I don't think you need a full cup of brown sugar.

This was a big hit when I brought it to my brother's house for a Football Championship Game Party!   So easy to make, and then keep warm in a small crock pot.

the main thing to know about these, MAKE TWICE AS MANY AS YOU THINK YOU WILL NEED!!!  people turn into animals around these, they are SO GOOD!!  I really pressed a good layer of brown sugar into the inside of the bacon (the side that was going to wrap around the little smokie).  I baked these on a broiler pan sprayed with non-stick spray, and they took about 35 minutes.
a great tip to lessen cleanup, line the bottom part of the broiler pan with foil, then you just throw away the foil.

These are FANTASTIC! When I make them for a crowd, I (at least) triple the batch. To speed up the assembly process, I start with a cookie sheet filled with brown sugar. Then I toss the bacon pieces in the sugar, and press sugar into the bacon as I roll it around the smokie in order to get as much sugar adhesion as possible! (I tried thick cut bacon once, but it didn't work out very well.)

I took these to a card party and took home an empty dish!  These were very good, but I have a quibble or two.  I used tooth picks instead of skewers, and it took so long for the bacon to get crisp that the sausages dried out a bit.  Next time, I will partially cook the bacon before wrapping it around the sausages to speed up the process.  Still a very good, easy recipe.

There is NO DOUBT that this is a five star recipe! I took these to a superbowl gathering at a nearby club last night. I made 80 of them. I carried them in a crockpot with a mixture of maple syrup & brown sugar to keep them moist. There were about 20 people there when I put them out about an hour before game time. They were gone within 20 minutes! I kept overhearing people rave on and on about them! I used a good quality maple flavored bacon and dipped the bacon in the brown sugar mixture before rolling them. I was able to get 5 smokies to one piece of bacon. Taking the lid off the crockpot to crisp the bacon as suggested by one reviewer really worked!

I've been making these for almost 10 years and am "told" that is what I'm bringing to parties. 
I have always used a whole box of brown sugar on them .. it's important for the fat and brown sugar to melt together and the weenies to cook in the sauce. I've never had them burn as others have stated. Yes it's greasy and messy but you transfer the weenies to a serving plate and if you have leftovers ( rare) its good to keep some of the sauce for reheating. If you want a lowfat or low sugar recipe.... this is NOT it... but it sure is tasty! :)

From word of mouth, people were asking for the recipe one week later that were NOT even at the party I took them to! I made them the night before. I like this method better because the brown sugar disolves. Also, I baked them for 20 minutes and turned them over for another 20 minutes to get them crispy. YUMMY :)

This a great recipe for a snack when you don't feel like a big meal. I also used toothpicks and put them in a freezer bag with a cup of brown sugar for and hour. Just too good to be that easy! Will make again and again, thanks

I have made these and got rave reviews but I used a LOT more Brown Sugar.  I sprinkled the brown sugar on the bacon before I rolled them and then just a little on top.  I am asked to bring these everywhere we go!

This is one of my favorite snacks to fix for company (although I did not get it here). Extra tip: definitely use more than 1 tsp brown sugar. I completly cover the sausages and then let sit for a while in the fridge before baking.  The longer the better!

I couldn't find cocktail sausages that were smoked so I used plain and they were great! My husband loved them and said they are in the top 5 of all the recipes I've made.  Definitely a must to try especially with all the holidays coming up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these for our NYE party last night and they were the most requested recipe by far! Everyone raved!
I soaked the toothpicks in water overnight.  Put a few packages of the sausages into a zip lock bag with a cup of brown sugar and let it sit overnight.  I rolled the sausage and bacon in the sugar and assembled and sprinkled more on top. I used a broiler pan and cooked at 375° for 30 minutes and turned them and cooked an additional 10 minutes.  Kept them in my crockpot until it was time to serve. EASY!

Very good u r way, but being from Louisiana I needed a little more spice. Instead of the brown  sugar, I crisped them then basted with pepper jelly. Cooked a  little longer and they were perfect for my get together and got rave reviews.

These are fantastic!  At my house we call it "Man Candy."  I actually dredge both sides of the bacon in the brown sugar before wrapping it around the smokies and then sprinkle the remaining brown sugar over the top before baking.  I also cook them on the broiler pan so any grease drips away.  They come out crispy and yummy.

I made this recipe for the first time on New Year's Eve a year ago.  I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to make it again. They are RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS! You really can't mess them up either - even if you burn them they are still yummy.  After I secure these things with toothpicks I throw them in a large ziplock and toss in the brown sugar, then let it marinate overnight.  I baste them with the leftover sugar syrup in the bag right before I bake them.  Following someone elses directions, I bake these for 45 minutes on a lower temp and then up the heat for the last 15 minutes.  I think it totally depends on the temperature of your oven.

Brought them to a party and they definitely went quickly. I probably won't use turkey bacon next time as it dried out.

I make these at least once a month. I use a roasting rack in a pan covered in foil. (Foil is the key, huge mess without it). Your arms will thank me. Do all the same things with the toothpicks and brown sugar. The bacon seems to crisp up better without sitting in the grease. Save the bacon/sugar drippings for chicken wings. Another great thing.

Wow! These turned out great. I was skeptical at first, but now a true believer. These have a fantastic taste with the brown sugar turning into a carmeling sort of coating. Come to think of it, I shall make these again this weekend, I think. Yum, yum!

I didn't even get these off the griddle before people were taking these. I had to make a lot more than I had expected because they went so fast! 
I actually just threw the uncooked Lil Smokies in a bowl of brown sugar, mixed them around and then wrapped them in the bacon. Once they were all on the griddle, I put a little bit more brown sugar on and then broiled them on low for about 7-10 minutes. Amazing, simple and SO messy!

Being from WI I make a version of this using bratwurst.  I simmer the brats in beer and then cut in about 2 inch slices and wrap a piece of bacon around securing with a tooth pick.  Then put them in a zip lock bag  to coat with with brown sugar and cayene pepper to your taste. Bake them until bacon is browned.  Keep warm in crock pot.

My friends and I called this 'bacon candy' while we ate it. I used a thick sliced apple bacon and regular smokies, and one slice of bacon could be cut to wrap four of them. I did not secure the bacon but instead wrapped with the open end facing the bottom of the pan. I prepared these the prior evening in a rectangle cake pan and baked the following day for approx 1 hour while removing several times to drain the pan and add more brown sugar. 

To keep these moist and warm, I used a small crock pot to create a buffet server. I added warm water to the bottom, crumpled foil to create a buffer (like a steamer) and lined the rest of the crock with a foil 'basket' which contained the smokies. I will make this again and again --- just fantastic!

Wish I could say how these were but they were gone before I could try them!  I made them a few days ahead, wrapping the bacon around the sausages.  It was incredibly quick, easy and neat - no mess.  Then the night before I added the brown sugar.  I used e center cut bacon as suggested, cut each slice in thirds.  Just a great recipe!

So good. Gobbled up at a cookout. Tip: make sure you line the baking sheet with a SINGLE piece of tin foil that is wide enough to cover the entire baking sheet. If you layer the tin foil (because it is not wide enough to cover the entire baking sheet), the caramelized brown sugar seeps between the layers and burns onto the baking sheet. Not fun to clean up!

These are very good. I just rolled the bacon around and then rolled them in the sugar. You don't need toothpicks. Keep an eye on them and do not overcook.

I just made these this evening for a birthday party. I cut my bacon into fourths so there would not be much overlap of bacon. I did not want any undercooked bacon. I like it crispy! When rolling them, I dipped the bacon in brown sugar and then rolled it around the smokie, securing it with a toothpick. I put the rolled smokies in a foil-lined pan, topped it with more brown sugar and let it sit in the fridge over night. When I pulled them out of the fridge, I spooned the glaze back over the smokies and put a bit more brown sugar on top. I baked them for about 45 minutes until crispy and served them right away. They were very good and the glaze that was created from the overnight stay in the fridge created an almost caramel coating on them.  Next time I think I will do as some other reviewers suggested and place them in a slow cooker to keep them warm while serving. As they started to cool, they became very sticky and a bit hard to eat. I was worried by putting them in a slow cooker they will lose their crispiness, but I do not think this will be the case. I look forward to making them again!

After making these many times with rave reviews, I found an easier way that saves some time. I cover the smokies in the brown sugar the night before & let marinate. A couple hours before I need to serve, I drain the accumulated juices/sugar into a pan. Put the smokies in a slow cooker on medium. I bring the previously drained sugary syrup to a low boil, then reduce to simmer, uncovered, until it is redced to a thicker syrup. Meanwhile, I cook a package of bacon, drain it and chop it up. Just before serving, I toss the crumbled bacon & thickened syrup with the smokies. Every smoky gets covered with sticky goodness and the bacon bits cling to every one. Serve with a cup of toothpicks on the side for skewering. Way less messy, super easy to transport and just as delicious!

Delicious! I purchased 1 lb of center cut bacon and cut the slab into 3 equal parts.  After rolling bacon around the smokie, i then rolled in brown sugar.  No skewer was needed; place seam side down on a broiling pan and cook...yummy!

These were a hit at my family's Christmas party!  I used applewood smoked bacon that I cut in half, dredged in brown sugar, wrapped around the smoky & secured each one with a toothpick. I baked longer than the twenty minutes, probably more like 35 just so the bacon wouldn't be soggy. I served it with a dipping sauce of 1/4 c chili sauce, 1/2 c mayo plus a tablespoon of lemon juice & 2 tbls brown sugar.

AMAZIN'! My family is full of self proclaimed chefs, and amongst all of our gourmet favorites, this simple appitizer ranked!  So easy and yet perfectly scrumptious. I caked them in brown sugar the day before and sealed them in a container in the fridge overnight. Then baked them (turning 1/2 way through) for almost an hour. They were perfect, perfect, perfect.

A broiling pan would be very helpful, esp. if you are making this for a get-together.  Good recipe, went over well. I inserted toothpicks into each and removed them just prior to serving for better presentation. Assembled the night before and covered them in brown sugar but sugar didn't adhere, so I did what others recommended and applied brown sugar to bacon wrap before wrapping.  Made a big difference.

Best ever.  Made these for an appetizer bar on labor day weekend and what a hit!  Folks are still talking about them.  I took a couple of suggestions from previous reviews to enhance the bacon goodness: *Coated the bacon in brown sugar before wrapping them around the smokies. *Broil them on a broiling pan about 15 minutes, turning once.  The excess sugar 'soup' runs off and they crisp up beautifully, no soggy bacon! *Served them with a perfect sauce: 1/4 cup each brown sugar, mayo and chili sauce.  Stir it up well and refrigerate the sauce a couple hours or overnight. This is going to be a party, lake weekend staple from now on!

These were a HUGE hit! I made mine a couple of different ways.  I did two skewers of Lil' Smokies and the rest I didn't skewer or toothpick at all.  I found that cutting the bacon slices into fourths worked best and that the bacon wrapped tightly around the smokies tended to stay put without toothpicks.  I coated both the bacon AND the smokies with brown sugar before wrapping them.  I'd definitely recommend turning them halfway through cooking, or broiling them on each side quickly to get them to crisp up nicely.  The crispy bacon and carmelized sugar helps hold everything together and keeps them from being quite so messy.  I'll definitely be making these again when we have guests, and I will serve with a honey mustard sauce and a tangy BBQ sauce for dipping, though they're excellent alone.

Absolutely LOVED this!! I always look for an excuse to make this. The sweetness of the brown sugar and the smoky bacon and slightly salty sausages are an incredible combination.

OOOOHHHH MMMMMYYYYY these are tasty!  They are like heart attacks on a stick, but you just can't stop eating them!  I made them for a Christmas party and everyone raved about them.  My husband has requested that I make them for appetizers on Christmas Day at my parents house.  
What I did was put a bunch of brown sugar in a mixing bowl, cut the bacon strips into 1/3rds, and mix them together in the bowl.  Then I just pulled them out as I needed to wrap the smokies.  I secured each smokie with a toothpick and marinated overnight.  I placed them in a broiler pan and drizzled the brown sugar liquid that had formed in the bottom of the marinade dish on top of the smokies.  I then sprinkled more brown sugar on top of that.  Do NOT skimp on the brown sugar - that is what makes these so darn good.

These were a hit at a Christmas gathering at my house. I found an easy way to turn the smokies half way through the baking process. I placed the smokies on long scewers. Two scewers going through the smokies... ladder fashion, placing about 8 bacon-wrapped smokies on each pair of scewers. Turning them in the oven was then simple. I also made them the night before and stacked the ladders of smokies in a 9x13 baking dish and paking the brown sugar around the smokies. It made them delicious and cut down on the mess of trying to dredge the bacon through the brown sugar. I baked them on broiler pan, lining the bottow with foil. Clean up was a snap. When done, I used a fork and simply slid the smokies off the scewers into a warm crockpot. Everyone at the party raved about them! I will certainly make them again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I always make this for parties.  I do it a bit differently though.  I just stick a toothpick on each one to keep the bacon from rolling off and for easy picking too.  Cook them until the bacon starts to crisp.  The toothpicks do well in the oven.  I cook them on a big pan with room to breath.  i let them sit on a papertowel for 10 seconds and them take them off to drain the oil.  Dont leave them on the paper towell for to long, cause they will stick from the brown sugar.

I tried this recipe for thanksgiving and everyone seemed to love it. I took the advice of letting the smokies sit in brown sugar overnight. I found this to be a really easy recipe to cook, I'm vegetarian and easily intimidated by cooking meat, it's very new to me, but my boyfriend said they were great. His only feedback was that they would be great wrapped in a crescent roll.

Can you say delicious!!!  Of course, anything wrapped in bacon has to be good.  I made this recipe for a party where there was a ton of food and it was the first (and maybe only) dish finished. I wrapped the smokies the night before and secured with pretty bamboo picks.  I put in a big plastic container and covered in the brown sugar to "marinate" overnight.  Did seem effective in coating the bacon with sugar.  It also seemed to stop my picks from turning black when broiling which looked nicer.  I know I will bring this recipe out for every party!!

I have been making these for years.  Ingredients are exactly what I use.  My baking is definitely different.  I place aluminum foil on cookie sheet.  Then place cookie rack on top, spray with oil. Next I place the brown sugar smokies (with toothpick in each) about 1/2" apart on the cookie racks. This way they do not burn. You can even turn smokies after 20 minutes by running a pancake turner across them to heat the other side. Your clean up is easy and your "Heart Attacks" are not burnt. I always get RAVE reviews (especially from the men). They keep saying "I'll have another Heart Attack". Great Recipe. Thanks!

Have made these a couple of times following suggestions from previous reviewers. 1) Use individual toothpicks, 2)Use a broiler pan as they can get pretty greasy, 3) Flip them over once to get even cooking 4) I baked mine til the sugar in the bottom of the broiler pan started smoking--not on purpose-which was approx 18-20 minutes.  These were scarfed up very quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

people LOVED these.  I admit I was horrified by the amount of oil in my pan - next time I'd use a wire rack to suspend them so they can drain off while the bacon crisps.  I found no need to skewer the sausages because the bacon stayed wrapped around them.

This was a great recipe! I made these for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. We had about 35 people so I had to increase the amound quite a bit. So for that reason they were a bit time consuming. Since I opted for the Costco size of smokies. Which by the way takes about 3 1/2 pounds of bacon. And I also did not measure the brown sugar. I just sprinkled them liberally. They turned out well and do not need to be attended while cooking. Which was good for me since I had other things to do to get the party ready. But to make a long story short. (too late?) Everyone loved them and I will be making them again soon Im sure. Thank you!

Did this for the superbowl...okay...but I think maple syrup would be as good.
I did one technique that solved the sticky pan problem.  Line a broiler pan base with foil then take a second sheet of foil about 1 1/2 times as long and crumple it up making it fit the pan but have peaks and valleys.  I used individual picks for the smokies and put them standing unevenly on the foil.  No sticking and mess was gathered up and tossed.

This is outrageously good.  However, you must absolutely ignore a lot of the cooking instructions.  The first time I tried this recipe, I used center-cut bacon, cooked for 50 minutes at 350, and it came out like bacon-flavored shoe leather. So here is the skinny on how to make these puppies live up to their hype.  Do NOT use center-cut bacon. You can only cut the bacon in halves, and it still over-wraps the sausages, as well as really driving up the costs.  To control the grease, use a good quality of bacon, like Oscar Meyer, and cook on a broiling pan, or place a baking rack inside of a regular baking sheet.  It is also a great idea to thread your sausages on inexpensive kabob skewers, with NO crowding, for easy turning. You also want to put a good wrap of aluminum foil on the bottom of your cooking pan, because the caramelized sugar and grease makes one heckuva mess.  OK, now you are all set for the cooking part, so here it is.  Preheat the oven to 375.  Sprinkle the prepared sausages with extra sugar.  Cook for 10 minutes, and turn over (using your skewers for an easy flip).  Sprinkle the new topside with additional sugar and cook for 10 more minutes.  Increase oven temperature to 450, cook for 2-4 minutes until nicely browned.  Flip again, sprinkle with sugar, and cook the new topside for 2-4 minutes. Yummy.  If you want to prepare these ahead to serve at a party, simply heat everything later in the microwave, and it will still be delicious. Enjoy!

These are great, super easy and always go over well.  I have no problem with my bacon crisping.  I use a 9 x 13 pan, layer it with aluminum foil, put in my bacon wrapped smokies, cover with brown sugar and bake.  The bacon grease cooks the bacon all the way through, and if you look for a leaner cut when buying, it wont be so greasy.  I cook mine then when done, remove from the excess grease.  They are great, never had any problems and never turned mine once.

I make this all the time. I Do it a little different though. I put the smokes in brown sugar 2 days before I need them to soak over night. Then the next day I wrap them in bacon and put them back in the brown sager for another night. When I am ready to cook I back them at 350 for 30min to start the bacon to firm up. The sprinkle with more sugar and throw them under broiler for about 5min to crisp it all up. By far its the hit of every party worth the extra work in the end.

I make these in a different way. I use hot dogs instead of little smokies. I cut the bacon in 3 pieces and the hot dogs in 3 pieces. Simply wrap the bacon around the hot dogs and secure with a toothpick. Then I layer them in a crock pot, a layer of brown sugar and a layer of the hot dogs. I add additional brown sugar on top and cook on high for about 3 hours. You will need to carefully stir them as they cook. I usually add more sugar as the cook down and use a turkey baster to suck up the liquid that accumulates in the bottom of the crock pot, if not the hot dogs will swell up from absorbing the liquid. I find this to be the easiest and less messy way to make these. Everyone loves them!

I have made these for years and I never have any leftovers. I use thin sliced bacon and that way you don't have to use toothpicks. I also roll the smokies in brown sugar before wrapping in bacon.

I served this easy to prepare appetizer and everyone loved it.  I did marinate everything overnight.  I then baked in the oven & kept warm in the slow cooker for serving.  One warning:  don't use colored cocktail toothpicks.  Some of the color leached onto the smokies making them look almost moldy!  But it did not affect the taste at all.  Highly recommended!

The brown sugar does not stick well to the lil smokies.  Then the brown sugar melts and sticks in your teeth.

These should be illegal.... Since my first batch of these, Smokies and bacon have become staples in my kitchen....  I've also learned better than to brag on them to the neighbors. :-)

I wish I could give this a positive review..but just can't!  This recipe takes much effort and makes quite a mess.  Someone suggested using a broiler pan to allow bacon grease to drip through--however, I tried this and it was not effective.  The brown sugar dripped through, as well as the grease from the bacon, which caused it to burn my pan. My oven was smoking!  Not to mention, the bacon does not stay wrapped around the sausages.  I had to transfer to a cookie sheet.  They need to be turned over- as they will burn on the bottom and not be done on the top--this is difficult when the bacon is coming apart from the sausages.  It is not an easy recipe and was quite time consuming..ruined a pan, and then the end product was not that great--good flavor, but the pan is a sticky greasy mess, even with a liner of foil/parchment paper.  Then you have to transfer these weinies into yet another pan to serve!  Lots of a hassle!  They were also waaaay to sweet..as I used the recommendations from others about sprinking more brown sugar on top.. I am not sure the crock pot would be a good method..as the grease would stay in the pan..so I just don't think this is a good recipe.  I spent way too much time on this, only to throw it away before leaving for a NYE party..had to order pizza and bring that..and make a quick dip.  :(  Not good!

I prepared this recipe as stated in the directions. (I am not yet a "freelancer" in the kitchen.) My family enjoyed them a lot as a part of our gameday festivities. However, I found them challenging to prepare. I watched them in the oven to be sure the bacon was crisp, and by the time my husband suggested I turn them over, the bottoms were a little bit burned, while the original tops still had little floppy bacon. Not sure of the solution to this. I welcome any suggestions. :)

Wow! These were good! I made them for an appetizer for my son's 28th Birthday party and they were  a big hit. I put the bacon and smokies in a bag to marinate overnight. I assembled them and then baked them till done. Delicious! Try Them for your next party, you won't be disappointed.

these things are heaven in your mouth, the boy and i became completely obsessed with these after making them three days in a row! (and then i had salad for a month haha) we figured out what worked and ended up using cooling racks to cook them on, on top of baking sheets, so they didn't sit in the bacon grease. i added a bit more brown sugar because the sweetness is what i love about these lil snack weenies. will def make again! many many many times!

I've made these sooo many times and it's always a hit! Instead of using skewers, I use toothpicks. And then when they're done you can put them all in a crock pot to stay warm!

The taste was great. I cooked mine in the slow cooker which did not crisp the bacon enough. Next time I will cook as instructed in the oven.

These are AMAZING! Even better grilled this year then they were baked last year! They were the first thing to go off my superbowl spread. :) Definitely do as others suggested and rub the smokies with half the brown sugar prior to wrapping with bacon. Then skewer and sprinkle the bacon with the remaining sugar before you grill. Thanks for posting!!

Followed suggestions to bake on broil pan and to roll the little smokes/bacon in brown sugar. Baked at 375, turning at about 20 minutes, until crisp (maybe 40 minutes?). These were gone in seconds!

Super delicious and very easy! I used a cooling rack on top of a foil-lined cookie sheet to bake these little treasures. That way they are crispy all the way around and cleanup is much easier.

Made this to test batch of 12 before bringing to Superbowl party. THIS IS A KEEPER!! VERY easy & tasty. I followed the comments, rolled the smokies in brown sugar, cooked for 40 minutes so bacon is crispy, double broiler to catch grease and my family LOVED them. My 10 year old wanted more!

I have been making these for years and agree with all the comments, but I sprinkle them with a little soy sauce as well, cover and refrigerate overnight.  I love the comment about using a slice of bread to soak up grease.  I'll have to try that.

Awesome little snack that everyone raves about. I add a line of catsup to mine before putting the brown sugar on.  This boosts the flavor right over the top!  Yum!

Very Good.  I marinated in brown sugar overnight in the refrigerator as suggested by one of the other reviewers.  Baked as directed on a foil lined baking sheet and placed seam side down.  No toothpicks needed.  A keeper.

These are really, really good... even better when you let them cool off a bit and the sugar partially solidifies.

Wow !!! What a hit !!!  These were devoured...  So easy and yes...add additional brown sugar.  I coated them liberally with it and did as another user stated and covered them then let them marinate overnight and that was the key !! Thanks for that tip !  A half strip of bacon per Smokie is perfect.  Will definitely make again very soon and highly suggest to anyone looking for an easy and awesome snack !

I'm rating the recipe as written.  After considerable time in the oven, the bacon became chewy rather than crispy.  To bring this up to 5 stars, use the microwave and roll the wrapped sausages in the brown sugar rather than sprinkle it on top.  You have to use toothpicks rather than skewers and rearrange them while cooking to have everything cook evenly, but they come out so much better.

These have been a staple in our house.  My guest go bonkers over these everytime I make them and they are usually the first things to disappear.  My sister who doesn't normally at meat was eating these.  Last time I made them they didn't make it to the table for appetizers because everyone was eating them as I was taking them out of the oven.  YUM YUM

I take these to many an event, whether tailgating, Christmas or cook-out. They are easy to make and delicious. I find that if I do them the night before and marinate in the brown sugar overnight that the flavor is more intense. They are fabulous!

They came out fine on tinfoil as long as you take them off right after cooking, dab off grease on paper towel and put them on serving plate!  You have to turn them 1/2 way through, cooked for 45 minutes and the kids love them!!

I tweaked a few things and next time i will follow the recipe more. I used the whole strip of bacon. First I placed the bacon in the sugar then wrapped the little smokie then I added more sugar on top. Last but not least I added a cherrie on top of each smokie and poured a little cherrie juice on the smoke. I wrapped them individually and used toothpicks. They were really delicious but a bit sweet. I made them for my boyfriend and I. We ate all but 3 and decided next time only to put brown sugar on top and always keep the cherrie that was super yummy and pretty. Thank you so much for the recipe I will make this for Rugby night!

Made these for a get together....they were good.  Everyone liked them, and the were all gone by the end of the evening.  For me, I didn't find them overly exciting, but they were easy to make and great for a finger food.

WOW, what a great variation on smokies! I had to broil mine on low for a few minutes to get them crispy! Would like to try this with the bacon on jalepeno poppers on the grill.

wrapped the smokies in maple bacon, sprinkled a lot of brown sugar on, let them sit in the fridge overnight, broiled them, flipped and broiled other side.  Made them for the super bowl.  Everyone raved about them!

This recipes is NO JOKE! I thought how could something so simple be as good as everyone is says, but I was wrong. IT IS! I made them for my daughters' birthday party and we set a few aside for some family that got lost and were late...you should have SEEN everyone circling them joking about who would get them if the latecomers never made it! LOL!  One pound of bacon was PERFECT for 1 package of smokies. I used CHEAP bacon, used no toothpicks/skewers, ROLLED them in brown sugar (as was suggested by another reviewer) once they were put together instead of sprinkling and then baked them on a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet with foil to catch the fat. I did have to bake them about 13 minutes longer to get them crisp.   DELICIOUS!

OH MY!  These are FABULOUS!  I quadrupled the recipe for our New Year's Eve party and every single one of them was gone within the first hour.  Absolutely sinful and delicious.  I will be using this one over and over again!  Thank you!

I made these the night before for a party for my parents. I sprinkled them with brown sugar and let them sit in the frigdge over night. Everyone loved them and they were a big hit. When I reheated a few the day after, they were still delicious. I would have preffered more brown sugar. But overall, these were great!

I baked in the oven until bacon (cut in thirds) was crispy then loaded up my crockpot.  Put extra brown sugar on top and boy were they great. Made for easy traveling and they stayed warm all afternoon. They were a huge hit!

A BIG HIT!  As other reviewers recommended I marinated overnight in a TON of brown sugar and used a disposible aluminum pan.  I baked mine 30 mins.  I will def make these again and again!!!

I made these for a Christmas Eve party and another batch for a Christmas party! I got rave reviews and didn't have any left each party. I have some tips after making it twice. I marinated the bacon-wrapped smokies in a Ziplock bag the night before, and then sprinkled with brown sugar when I got ready to bake. I baked them for 40 mintues on 350, turning once. Also, I would advise lining your cookie sheet with foil (the sugar and heat will make a nice crusty layer on your pan) and use a wire rack (lightly sprayed with cooking spray) to place your smokies on so the juice can drip onto your foil-lined pan. Perfect every time! Delicious! P.S. The Dip is a must!

These are amazing, I make them for every gathering! Like everyone else, I just a TON of brown sugar. I put a little brown sugar on the bottom of the pan before i put the bacon wrapped smokies on it, and then pack more on top so they get a good glaze all over. Also, I've found that if I don't use the bacon right out of the fridge, it falls apart easily. I suggest cutting the bacon in thirds and then putting the bacon back in the fridge and taking i out as you need it. It makes it SO much easier to work with! I always triple the batch, they are such a hit!

We made these for an appetizer and I really dont see what all the rage is. They are good but maybe I'm just partial to the little smokies smothered in BBQ sauce simmered in the crockpot - they're hard to beat! Definitely will stick to my original BBQ smokies next time. Never the less Thanks for the recipe though.

My picky teenagers always BEG for this wonderful treat every time we have a party.  I don't use wodden skewers, as long as you put sausages together nice and tight they do just fine.  I cook on a rack with a drip pan underneath so all the grease drips below.  Also, an extra hint, is to cover your drip pan with foil because the brown sugar and grease are hard to clean up.

Absolutely fantastic!!  I made a double batch the first time around and they were gone in no time!  Nothing but rave reviews.  I don't think a cup of brown sugar was needed.  Just eyeball it - just enough to cover the smokies on a cookie sheet.  I recommend putting these in a crock pot once with done in the oven.  Add the sauce from the cookie sheet and a splash of orange juice for added flavor.  Put it on a warm setting and you've got an appetizer that WOWs the crowd.  Thanks Tina!

I have made these several times and have tried different methods each time.  I like my bacon fully cooked, so I took the advice from another reviewer and believe I found the method that works best for me.    

1.  Line a microwavable plate with paper towels.  Place bacon slices on plate and cover with a couple extra paper towels.  Microwave for 90 seconds.  You will need to microwave several batches, but this will substantially reduce the grease in your dish.  

2.  Line your baking dish with foil - it is much easier to clean up!  

3.  Mix the brown sugar with a bit of water before pouring over the smokies; this has the same result as having refrigerated it overnight (no chunks of sugar - just pure smoothness).  

4.  Cook for 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees to carmelize the brown sugar and crisp the bacon.  

Soooo yummy, but terribly bad for you!

I would give this 4 stars personally but I am giving it 5 because everyone else loves it.  Big hit with adults and kids.  I find wrapping it with bacon is overkill and a pain in the neck.  Just cut a piece of bacon and stab it on like a blanket.  This is half the work and it avoids any undercooked bacon b/c it is over wrapped.

These barely made it to the table they were so good.  The only downside: They stuck to the pan and it was extremely difficult to clean up.  Aside from that, these were out of this world!!!!

We made 2 batches for the superbowl and they were the only food completely gone at the end.  They were delicious. We thought they were even better with a dipping sauce (mustard and grape jelly).  Also I cooked them on wire racks which made the bacon crispy. Kept them in a crockpot on low for party.  Next time I might try putting maple syrup on them- we tried it with a few and they were even better.

These sounded so good, but for people that like their bacon actually COOKED and CRISP instead of white and rubbery, this isn't the recipe for you.  However, I will try it again, but I'm going to experiment with frying the bacon till it's partially done and still maneuverable, let it cool slightly, and then wrap it around the smokie. Since I had to keep it in the oven for so long to cook the bacon (which never did get really cooked through), I ended up with a bunch of hard, crispy burnt brown sugar on the bottom of each appetizer. Not too appetizing!

Wow! I made these for someone's party the other day, but they were gone by the time the party started!

One of the changes I made was to use prosciutto instead of bacon (I had them in the fridge and thought, "Why not?") Turned out great. Also I used a little less sugar than some of the reviewers suggested and although they weren't as tasty as I'm sure they would have been with more sugar, I didn't have any trouble convincing myself that it was okay to eat more than one.

OMG... OUTSTANDING!!!  I just made these as an appetizer for Christmas at my brother's.  Because of so much to do, I decided to make them ahead of time.  I read some of the reviews and this is what I did.  I did buy the center cut bacon, as some suggested.  I then took a long plastic bowl with the brown sugar and then added the smokies and cut bacon pieces. I couldn't find my broiler pan, so I put foil on a sided cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.  I dredged the bacon pieces through the sugar and then rolled it around the smokie.  I didn't use a toothpick or skewers, as some said that the bacon stayed put.  I then sprinkled more brown sugar on top.  I baked them for about 40 mins. and then tasted!!!  Oh my... I could eat the entire pan and I am not a huge fan of hot dogs!!!  

Since there was a good amount of grease on the cookie sheet, I transferred the cooked smokies to a large corning ware dish (one that has the carrier and heat pack when you are taking it somewhere).  This way, I can layer them and keep them in the frige and just heat them at my brothers on Christmas.  Once I transferred them to the corningware dish, I also sprinkled some more brown sugar on them.  Figure it will melt when I heat them.  This is my first time making them and definitely won't be my last.  They are a little time-consuming, but worth every bite!!!!  Thanks!!

These turned out great.  I used the suggestion from another person and marinated the smokies and bacon with the brown sugar overnight.  
It was messy rolling them up but well worth it.  I was late for a party and they were gone within minutes.

So yummy! They were gobbled up in minutes and requested again by all.  I served them with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  I took the reccomendation of coating the bacon in the brown sugar and then wrapping the smokie.

I made these for our house warming party we had last weekend and they were a hit.  I made about 200 of them and prepared them the night before and covered them with brown sugar, then the next day cooked them at 325 for about 50 min.  I would recommend preparing them the night before, the brown suger soaks in and makes them so much better!!!!  Happy cooking!!!

Made this dish twice this week.  Once for a girls night and once for a mixed crowd on labor day.  Only dish to completely disappear at both events. Lots of compliments (and requests for the recipe).  Do use foil to line lower broiler pan and use non-stick spray for top pan for easier clean up.  I put the skewers in a large backing pan and covered with the brown sugar.  Skewers do help with turning them halfway through baking.  Easy to make because few ingredients!

I make this a little different and it is alot easier.  You can take little smokies or hotdogs cut in fourths.  Cover with bacon.  Put in a crockpot.  Pour one box of light brown sugar over the top.  Cook on high until the sugar is melted and is a syrup and the bacon is cooked, about 2 hours.  Everyone raves and request the recipe and it is easy!

A family favorite.  I often do all the prep work ahead. I line my pan with foil. I also third the bacon, wrap and use toothpicks, cover with foil and take out of fridge and put brown sugar on top and bake-until the bacon is crisp, however long that takes usually 45-50 min.  Great recipe and always a hit!

I've been making these for years and I have found some shortcuts!!  Instead of wrapping them in raw bacon I sprinkle real bacon bits over them, then the brown sugar!  Tastes the same and is so much quicker and a lot less mess from grease.  After I bake them for 30 minutes I throw all of it into the crockpot until party time.  Stays warm! These are why I get invited to parties!

I made this for our Christmas party and everyone LOVED IT!  Everyone asked for the recipe and couldn't believe it was only 3 ingredients. It was such a huge hit, everyone requested I make it for our New Years Eve party! Instead of baking it at 350 degrees, I placed it under the broiler for 15 minutes so the sugar would caramelize and the bacon would crisp. This is definitely a keeper!

WOW - what a great recipe! I made this 3 times over the holidays for different parties. I didn't have wooden skewers, so I used wooden toothpicks. I got 2 sausages on a toothpick. Also - don't use dye-colored toothpicks - the blue ones left marks when I took them off toothpicks. I tried granulated brown sugar thinking that would spread out over the smokies better, it turned out ok, but I had the BEST results using 1 cup of brown sugar. YES - use the whole cup.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and flipped the smokies after baking for 15-20 minutes. I baked for 15-20 minutes each side; for a total of about 40 minutes (to really crisp up the bacon).

MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOUR BAKING SHEET IS LINED WITH FOIL!!!! I got so many compliments on these smokies and gave out the recipe each time I made them. TINA -thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

I made these last night, a big hit with my family. They do take longer than 20 minutes to cook, mine took 45 minutes. I would suggest a disposable pan for cooking, (I am not looking forward to chipping the sugar off the pan)I lined the broiler bottom with foil, but not the top. I did not marinate as some suggested, they were great anyway !! One more suggestion, soak the toothpicks in water before you get started, mine were burned black, not very pretty...

Made 1 pound marinated overnight in brown sugar like other suggested and 1 pound just sprinkled with brown sugar since I didn't have the full amount of brown sugar the evening before.  I mixed them together on the pan and added additional brown sugar on top.  Needless to say they all went fast!  Even though all mixed together, I think marinating overnight then sprinkling before baking is the best.  I also baked about 45 minutes to get crisper.  Will do again, definitely~!

So very easy and delicious. I prepared these the night before, and I followed someone else's advice about 'marinating' them the night before. You've definitely got to make these! A guilty pleasure but sooooo good.

WOW!! What a great recipe. I made it for football night and it was a great hit! Even with the kids. Pretty simple to make, the only thing that concerned me was there wasn't really a cooking time listed. I kept mine in at 350 for 25 minutes and they were perfect. I reheated some this afternoon for lunch on high for 15 seconds in the microwave and they tasted just as good. Enjoy!

These were so good and so easy to make.  I used turkey bacon (approx. 3/4 lb.) to cut down on the fat and no one could tell the difference.  These went over very well with a small party we were having and were the first appetizer to disappear.  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks, Tina.

Tina, I have had this recipe before and was looking for it on the web when I came across yours.  Couldn't believe it when I saw you last name as that was my maiden name.  Just wondered where you are from.  I am originally from Oakdale California.  Maybe you could type in a reveiw and answer my question?

I made these for the Super Bowl---EXCELLENT!!  I did as one had said--I cooked for 20-25 minutes, then I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the bacon.  I also made these ahead of time and piled the brown sugar on over them and let them sit for a few hours in the fridge....A very big hit at our house! Thanks

For about the past 7 years my children have always requested a similar recipe I make - In fact, I believe the only difference is that I used "cut up" hot dogs and added a bit of water to the brown sugar.  I don't know why I never thought to use the smokies - super good!

This has become a favorite of everyone who tries
them.  I wrap the smokies in bacon and secure with a toothpick, put in a zip-lock back with lots of brown sugar and refrigerate for several hours.  I always use a foil-lined pan, otherwise
cleanup is a nightmare.  Last time I made them, I
turned the oven off and forgot they were in there
for several minutes.  They were all caramelized
and we loved them that way.

YES! YES! YES! These are great! I had 2 packages of little smokies that had been in my freezer for some time now and I had to find ways to use them up.  These were great! Easy and tasty...although I did use a little more brown sugar.  I think I could use these for a breakfast sidedish as well.  We loved to dip them in the "sauce" that is created by the brown sugar at the bottom of the glass baking dish that I used.

These weenies ROCK! I used the beef Lil Smokies, just dumped them in a baking pan, sprinkled brown sugar over them liberally, then laid bacon slices length ways over the top of this and baked till the bacon was fully cooked and the weenies were browned.  I made these as an appatizer for christmas, my guests never tasted them, the kids ate them before anyone arrived. Definitly THE FIRST thing to go!
These are REALLY REALLY GOOD!
I added a side of our favorite bbq sauce (Bob Evans Wildfire sauce) for dipping. SCRUMPTIOUS!
Definitly will make again and again...anytime snacks and holidays alike.

These were such a great appetizer at our party.  First thing to go out of an island full of food.  All the women were saying I HAVE to get that recipe!  I rinsed the smokies in a colander and patted them dry before putting in a ziplock bag with the brown sugar and let them sit about 30 min.  I partially froze the pound of bacon to make cutting into thirds easier.  I wrapped bacon around each  smokie (no need for toothpicks).  Important to set right on the broiler pan at this point or they don't stay wrapped that well.  Then put any extra brown sugar that's dissolved on the tops of them.  I just baked for about 35 min on center oven rack and they were perfect.  No need to broil them. Also one pkg of them didn't use the entire pound of bacon so I threw the  leftover bacon in the ziplock to marinate it as well.  Leftover brown sugar bacon?  Need I say more???

Made these for Superbowl party and they were a huge hit with both men and women.  The only thing I changed was to toss the bacon and smokies in the brown sugar before wrapping.  This used closer to 3 cups sugar. I didn't have much fat or a mess in the pan as others have commented. This may have been because of the sugar on the inside of the bacon soaking it up. Definitely a keeper

We all love these, but what I did was instead of putting the brown sugar on top, I mixed 1 cup of brown sugar with 1/2 cup mustard. After the smokies have baked in the oven I put them into the sauce, either in the slow cooker or in a sauce pan over low heat!!! Believe me, you will need to double or triple this one...Anyway you make them they are DELISH!!!

I found this recipe on the last page of Allrecipes magazine last week, I must live a sheltered life because I had never heard of this recipe before.  Following the recipe in the magazine, baking for almost an hour, mine turned out way over done, almost burned.  My husband however eats everything and ate the whole batch while watching Brady play for Patriot's glory.  I made the other half of the package last night and followed the recipe but cut the time down to 35 minutes.  I also put 8 of these little guy on long wooden picks, easier to turn, just slide the off when done and serve with toothpicks on the side.  I might add that cutting the time down my bacon was still crispy.  I know my oven is calibrated correctly because I have no problem with other recipes. Much better the second time around, I skipped the sauce too and didn't miss it at all.  This is a real keeper appetizer, especially since it can be made ahead of time and baked before guest even arrive.

Made exactly as written. I had tried a version at a party the week before, which were fabulous! Just figured this was the same recipe. Not. To get the bacon crispy enough, it burned the sugar. They were not great. I asked her today for her recipe, and for 1 lb of bacon and smokies, she uses 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 stick of melted butter. OK, now this is sounding good! My sons will be in heaven w/ bacon, brown sugar, smokies AND butter. Yes, I know this is not healthy, but that is not the issue here. Mix the butter w/ 1 cup of sugar and pour over wrapped smokies. Sprinkle the rest of the sugar over all. I can also see how some suggestions to make ahead and let marinate would work. The sugar would most likely melt more. Ours were too dry.

These are a hit every time!  I probably use way more brown sugar then the recipe calls for.  I do put them together the night before, and soak them in brown sugar.  Then I put them on a plate with lots of paper towel and microwave them for a minute or two.  Next I put them on a wire cooling rack that is sprayed with cooking spray over a foil lined baking sheet, use the brown sugar marinade from the overnight soak and coat them, and then bake them for 5-10 minutes.  Then I switch the oven to broil, and broil both sides until the bacon is nice and crispy!  It is a bit time consuming, but I hate under cooked bacon and always get loads of compliments.  I also serve it with with the dipping sauce someone else suggested - 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup red chili sauce, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Make this ahead of time too so that the sauce has time to meld together.  And you may have to coax people into trying the sauce, but the combination is to die for!

These are amazing!!!!  I like to coat them in a little spicy mustard before I add the brown sugar.  Great hot or room temp, make sure you use aluminium foil to cut down the mess.

So good!  These are super easy - and fun - to make, and they were such a big hit.  I made them for a friend's bachelorette party and all the ladies loved them.  We didn't have any leftovers.  I will definitely be making these again!  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and dredged the bacon strips in brown sugar before rolling them around the smokies, and I let them marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours before baking at 350 for about 40 minutes.  They turned out perfect!

I made these, and they are yummy! I find that 22 min's is the perfect time to get all of the brown sugar melted. And, if you soak the skewers in water for about 5 min's before putting the smokies on it keeps them from sticking after baking.

These are simple and delicious.  Brought these to a 420-style gathering and all of a sudden I could hear a man's voice loudly repeating "WHO brought these?"  I put my hand up and he said "These are like heaven on a toothpick."  He then proceeded to monitor how many everyone was eating and insisted that some be put aside for newcomers.  He would walk up to them with the weenie raised high, sort of singing like there were angels around, and he would present it to them on one knee :)  

Also brought them to my daughter's high school.  The boys fought over them and one ran away with the dish, gobbling as many as he could before they were taken away.  

Not such a big hit with my book club though.  Someone's always on a freakin diet. 

So just remember that if it's a mixed gathering, you might make someone's wife jealous, THEY'RE THAT GOOD!

I found I used WAAAAY more brown sugar than called for, even though I followed the recipe.  Just use more and enjoy the sweet syrupy deliciousness that is what we have dubbed "Maple Weenie Tots".

Took to a pool party last night and they were a hit...I did coat the bacon on brown sugar and then microwave to cook half way before I assembled with toothpicks and I think it helped them get crispy without over cooking the Smokies.  Definitely will make again!

I've made these on numerous occasions in the crock pot, keeping the setting on low for 2-3 hours before serving to heat and crystallize the sugar and cook the bacon. Test with your slow cooker, however, for cooking time.  They are sweet and savory and loved by everyone.

Disappointed in myself. Should of watched the video on how to make this recipe. I short changed my family by not putting enough sugar on top. Next time I'll make sure to add plenty of sugar

This recipe resulted in a very salty, very strong flavor. The brown sugar wasn't enough to hide the strong personalities of the bacon, and the sausage. I substituted the smokies for Hillshire Farm original breakfast sausages, and I found that they were really strong. I made these for the big game, but I could only eat one of them. The men at the party couldn't love them more, but those of us with a more delicate palate might find the flavor too strong.

I've made this recipe a couple of times. It's easy to do and quick, although I find that using pre-cooked bacon works better and there's not as much grease. My family loves these.

These are great! I have been making these for years... For a bit of texture & crunch... after I wrapped my smokies with bacon, I topped mine with a water chestnut and then sprinkle with the brown sugar. Bake @375 for 20 mins. or until bacon looks brown & crispy, Yum!                                                                                P.S. I use parchment paper on my baking sheet for easy clean up :)

The key is maple-flavored bacon and line the baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil to make clean up easy.  In our circles I am asked to bring these to gatherings.  They are known as "heaven on a stick".

Melt 1/2 butter and mix brown sugar with that.  Helps with the brown sugar problem.  Doesn't hurt to flip the smokies over halfway through the baking.

This recipe is a HIT with everyone. I've made it twice for parties and it's been the only appetizer completely gone. I like to wrap the bacon on the smokies and pin them with toothpicks. Then I roll them in brown sugar, shake them off and let them sit in a bowl...overnight if possible. Remove, put them in the baking pan single layer and sprinkle with brown sugar again. Bake until the sugar is all melted and the bacon is crispy. Remove to a serving bowl and watch your fingers!  One pack of smokies served about 10 people with 4-5 more apps. Made a double order and served about 16 people.

kind of fun to make. tossed the smokies in brown sugar, than the bacon, than rolled em up, popped em in the oven for about 20 minutes at 375. threw them all in a crock pot and put in fridge. Next day turned em on at about 8:30 (on high), and at our 1230 potluck they were almost perfect. I think next time maybe cooking a little longer before the crockpot. But definately a tasty little appetizer, especially for the meat lovers out there.

I made these as directed and after the bacon was cooked I put them into a slow cooker to get them to the party. They stayed hot and tasted good even after a couple of hours warming in the slow cooker. You could make these without the skewer and put a toothpick through them. It makes it easy to pick up individual appy's. The only thing I may do differently is marinate the bacon and the smokies in LOTS of brown sugar. I will definitely be making these again.

The bacon and sausage together are a lot of animal fat.  Overall a great party food.  Being generous with the brown sugar enhanced the flavors.

These are way too good!  Used maple bacon and secured with toothpicks. Baked until crispy.  Gone in no time.    Update!!!!! 10/19/14 Made a new version using Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage! Amazing! Cut each link in 4 pieces. Works easiest if links are very cold. Cut bacon strips in thirds. Wrap bacon a round sausage pieces and secure with toothpicks. These cook much longer as the sausage isn't precooked as the mini hotdogs are. Lined a jellyroll pan for easy cleanup. Mine cooked about 35-40 minutes. Used about 1 cup brown sugar per recipe. Yum! Try it!
Update- made tonight 7/13/17 for appetizer night. They are such wonderful bites. I wish the recipe had how long they cook for as I underestimated.  my previous review was for uncooked  johnsonville sausages so had to guess. That's the only flaw with these, and that's no biggie. I think mine cooked for about 30 min.

Huge winner at a hang out with snacks.  Followed other reviews to use brown sugar on inside and out.  After 10 min broiling on high mid level in oven, I flipped, then added maple syrup on the new side (works better for staying on while basting than the powdered version with brown sugar).  Made the dipping sauce which was eaten with the second batch as other reviewers noted: 1/4 c mayo, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c Rooster sauce (we like it hot, I started with just 2 Tbsp but guests wanted more).  Refrigerated sauce for 1 hr to let flavors blend.  Gone in less than 10 min for each tray.  I will double next time the amount of bacon, because I got an approximate 1:1 ratio of lil smokies to bacon slicing the pieces in thirds.

Tries htese twice- 1st time burnt to a crisp under the brioler in an attempt to crisp them up a bit.  2nd time used turkey little smokies and turkey bacon.  Cooked on a wire rack over a cookie sheet.  Still couldn't get them to turn out right.  The bacon was kind of tough.  I did dredge the smokies and the bacon in the sugar before wrapping which I will do again.  Not sure how to make this work but will keep trying because the flavor of the ones that turned out right was really good.  Edit 12/16- Made these again for a family Xmas gathering.  Finally!  They were all they were supposed to be and more.  I put a little brown (dark) sugar on each bacon piece before wrapping around smokie and threading onto a skewer.  Place in a big dish, sprinkled extra brown sugar over all, covered and chilled for a couple hours.  Lined a baking sheet with foil, put wire rack on top and tried to scoop up the syrupy stuff from the bottom of dish to add on top of skewers.  45 minutes, turned once half way through.  No one could stop eating them.  Made the sauce as others suggested and people really like that too although I don't think the sauce it necessary at all as these are awesome!  1 lb bacon and 1 package smokies go together perfectly.

I made these for a party and used other reviewers suggestions of "there is no such thing as too much brown sugar". I turned them several times while cooking (in a 9x13 pan) and added brown sugar each time. They came out rather dark, and unappealing. But only to me. Not only were all smokies consumed in record time, the pan drippings were scraped up and eaten too!

Delicious!  I make these for football parties and I always make double because they go fast!  The only thing is they're quite messy to make, I suggest putting the brown sugar in a ziploc bag, placing in the bacon wrapped smokies, and then shake to provide even coverage.

I made this for Valentine's potluck party at work, and my co-workers were already picking at it as I was walking to bring it to the boardroom. And when I laid it on the table, it didn't take long til all were gone! One of them said, "it's like heaven on a stick!" I was still receiving compliments til the next day! This recipe is awesome! And the best part is it's so easy to make!

BIG hit at our Superbowl party - I found, as other reviewers indicated, that I had to broil them in the end because the bacon wouldn't cook all the way through.  I also used thick cut bacon..d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s!

Yep, my guy friends LOVED these. Huge hit and agree with the rest of the reviews...use a lot of brown sugar. I marinated it overnight but next time I'll add extra brown sugar. Soo good.

Really tasty and the smell is amazing! We used maple bacon and placed 6-7 per skewer. Laid them all in a 13x9 and coated them thoroughly in brown sugar. They sat in the covered pan in the fridge for about an hour. Then we moved the skewers to a baking sheet and scooped the brown sugar back over. Baked at 350 for just under 30 min. We cut the skewers in half or thirds and keep them warm in a crock pot. Next time I will put foil over the baking sheet to make clean up easier.

Thought it was weird idea at first but it's tasty! Added a little cumin and cayenne to the brown sugar to up the oomph.

Great recipe!  Very tasty, I added some maple syrup to half of mine 10 minutes prior to removing from oven.  The syrup added some great flavor.
Next time I make I'm going to mix melted butter cayenne pepper to the syrup and brush on again with 10 minutes remaing to help with browning, crisping, and adding sweet spicy flavor to this

I have had these a couple of times when I was at a function.  They were fabulous!  I never did get the recipe so tried this one and was a bit disappointed as the brown sugar didn't melt as much as I thought it would, so just had crunchy bits of it on top.  I will try it again though as suggested, I will try marinating the brown sugar in with it.

For those of you who are dieting this year, take a day off and try these at your next get together.  They are so good.  My son's youth group loved them.  I made a double recipe and they were gone within 30 minutes.

By the time the bacon was cooked crispy enough, the smokies were kind of overcooked.

Made these for a Christmas Eve party and they were a huge hit!  Everyone LOVED them.  I wrapped the smokies with bacon, put them in a ziploc bag with the brown sugar and let them marinate for a few hours.  When it was time to put them in the oven, I sprinkled them with a little more brown sugar and baked until they were nice and brown.  I also served them with the dipping sauce recipe that I found on this site.  Not sure they need the sauce but I thought it was a nice touch.

I guess you must have to marinate these overnight because they tasted too bland to me. The recipe was easy to follow.

I make these for functions all the time, and they are always the first thing eaten. I usually make them ahead of time and cover them and leave them in the fridge before baking them.  The sugar really sinks into the bacon instead of sliding off into a sauce.  It also makes the cleanup a little easier. I also line them up on a pan lined with alumimum foil instead of attaching them to a skewer. Yum.

I've made these twice. Both times for a party. They were a big hit on both occasions. Both times I sliced the package of bacon in half and then rolled the sausages in a half piece of bacon. They fit perfectly, not too much excess bacon and there was no need for a toothpick. The other thing I did, by accident, was I left the wrapped sausages in a bag of brown sugar overnight. The sugars adhered to the bacon and then cooked up really nicely. I don't know if that makes any difference whatsoever. Anyway, excellent party fare.

I made these for Christmas eve last year and will definitely be making again this year!  They were the first thing gone from the table.  The men really ate them, but the ladies enjoyed them too.  So easy to make, but I suggest that you do them a day ahead and let them rest in the brown sugar and then to keep from making a large mess, line your baking sheet or cake pan with foil.  The sugar really gets hot and it will stick.

Fabulous find! The only mistake I made was not doubling the recipe. I assembled the smokies & bacon and tossed them in a container with the brown sugar. I transferred the cooked smokies to a mini slow cooker which made them easy to transport to the party. They were a hit!

I have made these twice to bring to parties.  This is the first one to be finished.  I would recommend marinating the bacon wrapped smokies in brown sugar over night, mixing it once or twice during the marination, the longer the better.  I get so many compliments.

How can anyone not love a pork product wrapped in more pork and rolled in brown sugar?!  These were FAB!  Kids love them, adults love them, anything with a pulse loves these little bite-sized morsels of greasy delicious goodness.  I can see how these would be awesome for parties.  So easy to make!  I'll definitely be making them again.  :-)

I fell in love with these little sweet smothered smokies at a Hawkeye game! I never realized how easy they were to make either. I will say allow like 20 minutes to prepare and the same for baking time. The only thing I need to change for next time is to add more brown sugar so it's a little more flavorful.

Delicious and super easy.  I didn't use skewers the first time and my bacon stuck to the pan - so I would definitely recommend giving them a little height!  As other reviewers said, you can't go wrong with adding more brown sugar - I coated the bacon and smokies with brown sugar before I wrapped them, and then covered them liberally with brown sugar and they tasted great.

Loved this recipe!  The only thing better than bacon?  Bacon wrapped smokies, of course.  :)  We used thick cuts of maple smoked bacon, and only used a small amount of brown sugar.  It turned out fantastic.  Because the bacon was on the thicker side, it took about 40 minutes to cook.  I like my bacon crispy, so I finished it under the broiler to crisp it up.  All in all, an easy and yummy treat!

Would give this recipe for stars, but I've tried this recipe a couple of times and the oven really needs to be at a higher temperature or you have to cook them forever. I also followed a tip and put the bacon in the sugar overnight.

Agree with other posts. This is a hit. I covered the bacon and smokies in brown sugar separately and then rolled again once together. I prepped them all the night before so all I had to do was pop them in the oven before time to serve.

I made these for my superbowl party this year, they were a huge hit, everyone loved them. I made the recipe as listed, and for the brown sugar, I scooped out big handfuls and covered the sausages throughly. Everyone was saying the more sugar the better so I heaped it on. This recipe has made it into my recipe box for sure!

These were delicious! Although they cooled off pretty quickly when sitting on a platter, so next time I think I would cook them and leave them in a crockpot so they stay warm.

I only made 10 smokies today - wanted to try the recipe before tomorrow's party. They were easy to make and came out delicious! They had just the right amount of the saltiness from the meats and the sweetness from the sugar. Perfect combination. I'll be making lots more tomorrow :)

yummy!! no such thing as too much brown sugar for these. after wrapping the bacon around the beef, i pressed all sides in brown sugar and put in a throw-away foil pan, let sit in fridge for several hours (or overnight) then before cooking, sprinkled them again with brown sugar (since the bottoms are sitting in the syrup, don't rotate them). cooked for about 45 min then put under the broiler (on low) for 5 min, flipped them over sprinkled with more sugar and cook that side another 5 min. also after flipping them that last time, i cut slits in the foil pan and let the grease drain out into my boiler pan.

First we rolled the smokies in the bacon, then we sprinkled with the brown sugar, and last we speared each with a toothpick. Baked as directed. They were wonderful!

Somewhat time consuming/messy, but as other reviewers said- well worth it!  Instead of putting on a skewer, I put them each on a toothpick- easy for people to grab.

Have made this 2x the past month! First time I did not marinate and used center cut bacon and speared each smokie with a toothpick.  Took about 30 min @ 350F, but still delicious and the 4 dozen I made was gobbled up in about 5 min with people asking if I could make more.  Second time, marinated overnight in fridge (brought to room temp over about 30 min)  and then used precooked bacon (lathered in brown sugar) to wrap it.  Took about 10 min @ 350F, turned out even better! Highly recommended recipe...thank you Tina!!!

We love these little bites....a few changes we make to add a little spice: sprinkle each wrapped piece with a little ground chipotle chili powder before the sugar, or use the spicy smokies (can't always find them).  My family LOVES them!

So simple and delicious! I'd also watch out for all the grease these create; the first time I made these, it was in a cookie pan and the grease spilled over and started my oven on fire!! So, just be careful :)

I'm reviewing these great smokies because although I didn't make them I sure ate them! (My friend made them and I had to get the recipe).  I always avoid the wiener type appetizers but tried these and loved them.  In particular, I liked the crispy texture which I think makes them special.  The sausages carried the flavor all by themselves and the sauce detracted from them, in my opinion.

I hate to beat a dead horse here, but these were so good!  I used another reviewers advice and dredged the bacon in brown sugar before wrapping them, sprinkled with more on top and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours before I cooked them.  I did them on a rack over a cookie sheet to let the grease drain and did them under the broiler, placed in the center of the oven...made the mistake of starting them too close to the broiler and wow, they started sizzling big time.... cooked about 10 mins per side, and added more brown sugar when turning.  That being said, next time, I think I would let them soak in the brown sugar at least over night, you just can't use too much, they were SO GOOD.  Will be making again on NYE, thanks!

Oh my gosh!  This recipe is awesome!!  So easy to make and very delicious!  I made this the night before and let it refridgerate over night.  Also, instead of slicing the bacon in thirds you can slice it in fourths.  It still leaves a lot of bacon for each smokie. The next day I tossed it in it's juices, put it on a broiler pan (to help drain the bacon grease) sprinkled a little more brown sugar (avoid sprinkling clumps though) and baked it for 30-35 minutes to make sure the bacon was crisp.  It turned out great!  Perfect for parties and make sure you make a lot, because it will go fast!  TIP:   Line the bottom of the broiler pan with foil for easier clean up.

Amazing.  These were the hit at our party.  Every smokie was gone in no time.  Next time will double the batch.  Baked in oven as directed in 5 minute increments to make sure they did not burn.

This is really a great & simple appetizer. I haven't even bothered with the toothpicks, they stay together just fine. The first time I made them, I baked them on a cookie sheet pan and had to transfer them to another pan half way through baking, as they were covered in fat. The last time I made them, I put them on a broiler pan, which came out perfectly. I did add additional brown sugar at the end of baking and broiled them to add some additional sugary, crunchy goodness!!!

This recipe seemed easy, so I dont know what went wrong. I did exactly as the recipe called for and after 25 minutes in the oven, the brown sugar was still in crystalized form. The bacon was getting hard and the brown sugar was not melting. We ended up brushing off the brown sugar and eating the hard bacon and overdone smokie. Will not be making again.

I modified this for a little more kick.  I added 2 Tbsp or so of chili powder to the brown sugar and place in a bowl.  I cut the bacon strips in half (don't use thick cut because it takes too long to get done).  I also use chicken pieces instead of the little smokies.  I wrap each piece of chicken and secure with a toothpick.  They are awesome!!

Super easy, but one suggestion...I cook them half way with half the brown sugar, then pour off the accumulated grease, add the rest of the brown sugar and they come out glazed!

They are a fantastic little snack that are just as good cooled off as they are right out of the oven. I definitely take the advice of others, and totally smother the bacon wrapped smokies with brown sugar...the more the better. I have found that they turn out perfect when I wrap them up the night before, put them in a covered bowl with the brown sugar, toss well, and let "marinate" all night. Then, covering them with all of the sauce they've created, I bake them for an extended time until crisp. Not being surprised if they take 45 minutes. The bacon must be crisp for my taste. It's even better if midway, you turn them.

These are absolutely fabulous! Certainly not low on fat and calories, but for that very occasional party makes them a bit more accepting to us who are watching our fat intake.

I make these with microwave bacon already cooked. I wrap each smokie ( after they have been put in a zip lock bag with brown sugar, ( I use splenda) with 1/2 piece of bacon. Micro for about 1 1/2 minutes or until bacon is sizzling

Fantastic recipe!  I found that putting the pan under the broiler for about 5 minutes at the end really crisped up the bacon.

Perfect! I love this at a party. I cook mine the same but I always put them in a slow cooker to keep them warm. I dump the cooked glazed smokies wrapped in bacon into the slow cooker with a little brown sugar and you will have a tasty treat that stays warm the whole time. Great for fall/ winter months.

I made 120 servings of these this weekend for a wedding reception. Very popular with the guests! Just be careful, they burn easily...it's hard to get the bacon crispy without burning the brown sugar.

Incredibly good.  Incredibly easy.  I opted for low sodium bacon, but found it to be too fatty for my taste.  So next time I will be looking for good meaty bacon.  I make them and then keep them warm in a crock pot.

I do NOT eat pork or red meat, so I can only tell you what my guests said.  "Pork Candy", "Those are amazing, what are they", and too many requests for the recipe to count!  I had a party of 50 guests last weekend, I made a double batch of these.  The great thing about these is that they can be made ahead.  I made mine ONE WEEK ahead b/c I knew I would be in a time crunch.  I wrapped them in bacon, put them in a covered dish, sprinkled b.sugar on them.  I cooked them in a crockpot for 4 hours, then placed them on a broiler pan and sprinkled more b.sugar on them, watch very closely, brown.  The broling makes a sticky glaze.  I served them with toothpicks and they were honestly the first things to go!  You can't go wrong with these.  I didn't even secure them with a toothpick when I baked them or made them.

These are the best potluck or party food that I have ever made.  I use center cut bacon and cook the bacon in the oven for about 10 minutes at 400 degrees before I wrap the little smokies, just until the edges are brown but the center is still pink and soft. This cuts back significantly on the grease and also helps crisp the bacon. I also drizzled them with a little molasses before I sprinkled on the brown sugar. Delicious!

I have fixed these for every occasion you can think of: Christmas, Thanksgiving (as appetizers), birthdays, baby showers, Super Bowl parties...regardless of where I bring them, they are guaranteed to be a goner in a matter of minutes!! Like many others, I find that they bake better when they sit in the fridge and allow the brown sugar to "melt" and then are sprinkled with extra brown sugar right before placed in the oven.  This is one of the easiest and best recipes that I own.

We liked these very much. But a word of caution...More than one reviewer said to add liberal amounts of brown sugar, one even said you can't add too much. However, I put too much brown sugar, it bubbled up and over the edge of the baking sheet during cooking. I didn't think of the possibility that the bacon grease produced in the oven would mix with the excess brown sugar and flow all over my electric oven. Once the liquid mixture touched the heating element, it burst into flames! The flames were extinguished and now we have to clean up the mess but just wanted to let others know to use a 13 x 9 ' pan or go easy on the brown sugar!

What a hit!  Took them to a Halloween party and they were the only appetizer completely gone!  I used two packages of smokies and cut the pound of bacon in fourths.  Not quite enough bacon for all, but there were only about 8 or 10 smokies without it.  I put the brown sugar in a bag and coated the smokies before wrapping and also sprinkled it on top as written.  I did not use toothpicks, they were fine without them because the sugar and bacon melted together to keep it in place.  So good, thanks for sharing!

My family has had this recipe for years but instead of smokies we use hot dogs. The bacon is sliced in thirds and the hot dogs in quarters. My in-laws insist I make these for all family functions now.

I cooked these at home and brought them to a friends house, so they cooled down quite a bit, but were warm (not hot)when we ate them and they were very good.  However, I do not agree with a previous reviewers statement that they would be good hot or cold.  The bacon grease solidified under the appetizer as they cooled, and I just didn't care for the look of the platter as they were eaten. Definitely make this if you are serving them soon after they leave the oven because they are de-lish when hot or warm!  How can you go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon?

Candied Meat..... What could be better???  First, I threaded the wrapped smokies on bamboo skewers, keeping space in between each one.  Then sprinkled brown sugar generously over them and let them sit in fridge overnight.  Then sprinkled again while oven was heating up.  I cooked them on a baking rack (for cooling cookies) in my half-sheet pan, flipping skewers a couple of times until all sides were crispy.  It took a while - maybe 30-45 minutes.  OMG good!!!!!  Will not only make again, will make time and time again.  My new favorite!

Wow, very good!  I made 50 for UFC Fight Night and they were gone in like 10 minutes.  My husbands friends were talking about them the next night at work. They took 45 min I fliped them over half way and then put them under the broiler for 1 min. on each side.

These were good and tasty but I bet they can put a hurtin' on your heart if you eat them too much. I used a lean pork bacon with beef smokies. If I make these again I may try to find turkey or chicken smokies and wrap them in turkey bacon. The brown sugar was a nice touch, everyone liked them!

These were excellent! I dredged my bacon in the brown sugar, wrapped them around the smokies and placed them on a broiler pan. Baked for 20 minutes and took them to a party. They were devoured within 15 minutes!

This was a huge hit at my last party! I made them in the crock pot like another user recommended and they were gone in an hour! Great recipe and besides the greasy beginning there is no real mess with a crock pot liner!

These are great, have made several times. But to do in crockpot we found them to get gressy and can get tough if on too long.  Wonder if anyone has made more than 4 batches of these? I have done 4 for graduation party and wasn't happy with results.  I have been asked to do them for a wedding and haven't figured out how to cook that many and keep GOOD without overcooking.  We have pictures at 4 and wedding is at 7. Any suggestions would be helpful.

I can't even tell you how many times I've recommended these little buggers.  Both my husband and my son went ga-ga over these.  Seriously ga-ga.  They couldn't get enough.  My husband even moaned while eating them cold.  They are THAT good.  A sure Sunday football game favorite around here...and then some!

These are always a huge hit at my parties and family gatherings! They are a lot of work, but totally worth it. I always mix the brown sugar with just enough water to make it into a thick paste then pour the mixture over the top of the bacon-wrapped smokies. I then drizzle them with honey and pop them into the oven. Absolutely delicious!

I followed the suggestion of someone else.  I dumped everything in a crock pot and let them go.  It was a little time consuming wrapping all of those weinies, but very easy in the end.  Everyone loved them.

WOW! I made these for New Years Eve and they were the first to go, and I doubled the receipe. Everyone asked for the receipe- EVERYONE. I made the dipping sauce that others recommended but you really don't need one- they are that good. I stuck to the ingredients listed but I did toss the cut bacon in a gallon sized ziplock bag with the sugar, then I rolled them. When I went to bake them a few hours later, the sugar had turned into syrup! I lined the bottom of my broiler pan with foil and placed 3 smokies in each slit of the pan. The toothpicks were great because they held them in place. 10 minutes on each side. YUMMMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!

Wow!!! These were a HUGE hit at my x-mas party. Next time I will have to make two packages. I lined my pan with waxed paper so the mess was easy to clean up. I also dipped the smokies in brown sugar instead of sprinkeling on top. I was worried about the bacon being soggy, but I used the center cut bacon(which others suggested) and it was very crisp. Everyone thought these were the best smokies and I will always make these from now on.

I prepared these the night before on a baking sheet, covered and refrigerated them. The next day, I baked them in the toaster oven because my oven was being used. They were a big hit on Thanksgiving. I set them out with other appetizers and these were gone in a few minutes. They were very tasty!

I followed others advice and made these the night before cooking. I snuck a few in the oven right after I rolled them, though, and they were not as good as those I made the day after (that had sat in the fridge). The bacon also crisped the second day without having to broil, and there was not as much grease or mess. Like others, I rolled both sides of bacon (center-cut) in brown sugar before rolling the smokies. Definitely an appetizer for the men.

Made these tasty treats for a Thanksgiving appetizer.  Everyone loved them.  They must be turned over half way thru to be evenly crispy.  The dip is a wonderful addition.  I'll be making these again.  A bit time consuming but well worth the effort.  Thanks for sharing.

When a co-worker brought these to a potluck, I thought they looked DISGUSTING. I wasn't going to hurt her feelings, though, and I tried one. Wow. I ended up eating several more right away! 

Now I make these every Thanksgiving (huge potluck). They are messy and time-consuming to prepare, though. Easiest if you prepare them the night before, cook in the morning, and keep them warm in the crockpot. Oh, and use a crockpot baggie to help with cleanup.

Yum Yum Yum!  I love this recipe!  I've followed others suggestions, dredging the bacon and smokie in the brown sugar.  I've used my broiling pan lined with foil (for SUPER easy clean up!) and used water soaked toothpicks.  I've tried without the toothpicks, but I find it easy to "turn" the smokies (to crisp all of the bacon) with the toothpicks.  I like to make these for parties or just for us...either way they go so fast!

I have been making these for a long time. However, once the sugar is melted, I put the smokies on a plate, pour the grease out of the pan, put the smokies back in and pour honey bbq sauce over them. I put it back in the oven until the bbq sauce is bubbly. I made 150 for a small party and they were gone within 30 minutes. SO GOOD!

I have made these countless times and served them at parties.  Always a hit, expecially with the guys.  I do like to slighly cook them and drain some of the excess fat from the dish before I add the brown sugar and complete the cooking.

I loved these little treats, and they were a big hit at Superbowl parties.  I add a little larger than a sliver of jalapeno or serrano to the wrap.  Gives it a little extra spicy kick to go with the sweetness!

I made these for a family Super Bowl party and they were a hit! Very easy.  They did not last long.  I saw Paula Deen make a very similar recipe using small pieces of chicken breast and she added some chili powder to the brown sugar - then rolled the chicken/bacon combo in the brown sugar.  I might try that next time.  But, even if you make them just as the recipe states - they are wonderful.

Everyone at my superbowl party raved about these. Definately a keeper! After cooking these in the oven and putting them in a slow cooker to keep warm, I did add bbq sauce to it and it added an extra something that was incredible. Gone in record time!

I discovered these a few years ago from a guy I dated and he/I do it a little differently.  I secure the bacon and smokies with toothpicks and then "dunk" in a bowl of brown sugar, coating each before putting on the bacon sheet.  You gotta make sure the smokies stay moist!

Even though it is New Year's Eve, I couldn't wait until tomorrow to give my review for this one.  This recipe was OUTSTANDING!! This is definitely my new favorite appetizer.  My family and friends loved it.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Instead of sprinkling the brown sugar on top, I just poured it in a bowl and coated each piece of bacon on both sides before wrapping the smokie. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

I have made these a few times now.  These are going to be the first to disappear at your appetizer table.  People LOVE these!!  I always use toothpicks for skewers and cut the bacon into thirds.  A big pan will take 45- min. to an hour to cook.  They will crisp up even further after removing from the oven.  Enjoy!!!

I made these the night before our party, storing them on a broiler pan, and then just threw them in the oven.  The broiler pan is a must in my  opinion, or they would have been just sitting in bacon grease.  I think it took about 40 minutes for the bacon to get nice and crisp.

these are awesome.  i get asked to bring them to parties all the time.  one thing i learned though--put these on a disposable tin baking sheet lined with reynolds release.  i ruined a baking sheet before learning this because the carmelized brown sugar can be very difficult to remove.

Awesome..simply awesome.  This is how I did them -I lined a cookie sheet w/ alum. foil (a necessity!). Then, I put these on a bamboo skewer (not soaked in water..i'm too lazy), about 7 to a skewer.
Then just put sugar on and baked at 350 deg. for about 40 minutes..then turned them and baked about another 10 minutes. 
Yummy!

I didn't know how long to cook these so I cooked them for 20 minutes.  I wish I had cooked them longer but the brown sugar that had spilled on the bottom of the pan seemed to be burning. So, next time I think I'll do what someone else suggested and dip the bacon in the brown sugar first and then wrap the smokie so that all the sugar mixes with the grease and doesn't burn.  Then I can cook them for 30 - 40 minutes so the bacon can get really crisp.

My children hosted a Christmas open house for their high school and college friends, and this was one of the 2 or 3 most popular dishes.  I personally would have rated it a 4 -- but when girls in size 2 dresses go back for seconds and thirds and 23-year-old guys ask you for the recipe, you gotta give it that 5th star, right?  :)  Simple enough for a novice, but time-consuming enough that even an experienced cook should assemble these the day before the party.  I ran low on bacon and found that cutting each slice into 4 pieces instead of 3 worked fine.

WOW! These are fantastic! So simple, too! I read the reviews before making and followed the advice on a few by marinating the smokies in some brown sugar before hand. However, I will not do that again as it made them a bit too gooey. A few people said they were really good but the sugar was sticking to their teeth. Otherwise these were a definate hit!:)

Really great!  The advice I took from the other reviews was to place in a Ziploc bag overnight and then re-coat with brown sugar just before broiling.  I broiled on low broil 10 minutes on one side, then flipped the skewers and broiled 5 minutes on the other.  A definite keeper.

Loved this recipe...very easy to do. I used a lot more sugar than the recipe states. I cooked these for my fiance and he loved them! I also snuck a few too ;) Great - and I just used a regular baking dish...but don't forget the foil!

Delicious.  Next time I think I'll try low-sodium bacon to cut the saltiness a little.  I used much more brown sugar than recipe calls for.  Good with honey mustard or BBQ sauce.

Yummy! They were all gone in about 10 min. I need to double the recipe next time. I covered the bacon in brown sugar and rolled them up. It was the easiest thing to make. No measuring.

These were delish and snapped up right away at coffee hour.  Next time I'll add a little water to the sugar so I can stick a dab on each smokie.

Really outstanding!  I don't know about the claim that they can be prepared in 10 minutes and cooked in 20.  There's at least 36 slices of bacon to wrap around the smokies.  Then I baked them for 20 minutes, but they weren't ready.  Another 5 minutes at 400 degrees still didn't do it.  So I finished them in the broiler for 3 minutes - and everything was done to perfection.  Served them with one dip of honey mustard, and another with dill mustard.  Even the wife loved 'em.

WOW!! These were to die for! They are great on their own but the dipping sauce BONNIE Q posted along with the ingredients in her review, took them to a whole other level!! It was 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, and 1/2 cup brown sugar (hubby hates mayo so I snuck not quite 1/4 cup and then added 1/4 cup of Creme Fraiche (easily made but requires 24 hours - 1 cup heavy cream to 1 1/2 tablespoons buttermilk - mix and allow to sit out unfrigerated for 10 - 12 hours stirring at least once - then refrigerate for 12 hours, good for 2 weeks).  It was kind of thick so I thinned it out with some whipping cream. Made it ahead of time the night before put it in the frige so the flavor's could meld nicely and meld it did! We also made the smokies the night before dredging both sides of the bacon and the smokies and rolled them up, secured with a toothpick, poured a little more brown sugar over them and let them set over night in the frige.  Used the glaze the marination makes to baste them 2 - 3 times during cooking.  Cooked them for 15 minutes per side on 350 degrees and then turned the broiler on high and broiled each side until carmelized about 5-7 min each.OMG!! We made a double batch and they were devoured. We make a pork tenderloin that has a bacon wrap weave around it and a brown sugar glaze that's to die for so when we saw this we knew it was going to be awesome! Anyone interested in the bacon weave brown sugar glazed tenderloin recipe email me at kilyena@triad.rr.com.

Love these!  Recommend following others suggestions who said to wrap in bacon, microwave just a bit so that the bacon just starts to cook, then put in a large baggie of brown sugar so the bacon grease and brown sugar really blends together and coats the smokies.  This is a must-have dish for our family during holiday parties.

If you want your local fire department to come to your home, then broil them. Seriously, they looked better before I turned up the heat half-way through the cooking process. I nearly caught the house on fire by turning on the broler. So, please, skip it. Just bake them in a medium 350 degree oven as suggested. They were a little bit charred, but still tasted good. Good "dude food" for the game. Make again! Loved it!

This is just like another recipe here.  I made these for Super Bowl 2015 and enjoyed them.  I did put the brown sugar in a baggie and shook the wrapped sausages in there, easy peasy.  Baked on aluminum foil and easy clean up to boot!

Don't forget the chili powder mixed in with the brown sugar.  I use chipotle powder.  

PS, is anyone having problems with all kinds of pop ups on this site.  Making me crazy and freezes my computer.

Simple ingredient list. Easy to prepare. Kinda messy to make, but Oh so worth it! Hard to eat just one. I was looking for something to serve a group of friends coming over to watch football that would put some meat on their ribs and satisfy hunger without serving an entree'. Frankly, I wasn't sure how well they'd be received as I was thinking they might be considered "man food" by my all-girl group, but these babies were inhaled. Bite-sized, and easy to pick up and eat without having to use a plate or utensils...met all my criteria for a successful hors d'oeuvre.

These are very good. I wrapped the smokies in the bacon and baked for  45 mins @ 350. Then I put in crock pot then added 1stick of butter and 1 cup brown. Great for parties foods.

I did individual ones with toothpicks. Kept them in for about 35-40 minutes (because I forgot to reset a timer after checking them at 20 minutes) & they were perfect. I should've removed all of them immediately because some were almost glued to the pan after letting them sit for 30 minutes. The ones I served immediately were amazing! I will be using this one frequently during the holiday season.

One of our dinner guests called these "crack horsdeoerves" because you cannot. stop. eating. them.

I also dredge the assembled smokie and bacon in more brown sugar before baking.  Low and slow.

These were easy and delicious. I make a couple batches. The first one I made following the recipe and it tasted good. The second batch I made I added Cayenne pepper; it was sweet and spicy, I loved it!! I will make these again as an appetizer or snack.

These were soooo good!  I cooked them for close to 30 min and then browned them a little bit more under the broiler, this made the brown sugar crystallize for a crunchy delicious treat.

These are a hit everywhere I go!  I use the thick cut bacon and coat all sides with brown sugar than roll smoke and pin it with a toothpick.   You will use more than 1 cup of sugar.  I dump a lot in a bowl. Cook time is about 45mins.

I had to make a second batch of these sweet little meat nuggets.They were gone within about 10 minutes of laying them out. They didn't even make it out of the kitchen to their party destination. I ended up cooking them 45 minutes or longer and increased the temperature to 375 for the last 15 minutes. I suggest making more than you think your guests will eat! A sure party hit!

I plan to try this ASAP.  I have one suggestion.  When I use little smokies, I boil the amount that I am going to use for a few minutes.  This eliminate extra fat.  It also makes them very tender.

Made these for our Super Bowl Gathering. GO Seahawks! They were juicey, sweet and crispy! I served them on a bed of Baby Arugula with no dipping sauce. These are a great finger food and taste-wise stand on their own. The perfect football party food.

I'm glad I read other reviews before making these.  THE COOKING RACK IS A MUST!!!! I also highly recommend soaking the skewers in water for about 10 min. if you choose to use those.  I wrapped the smokies in the bacon, and then rolled them in brown sugar before putting them on the skewers.  Then, I sprinkled more brown sugar over them after putting them on the rack.  Don't forget to put foil under the rack as well.  I baked them for 30 min. at 350, then I flipped them, raised the temp to 400 and baked another 15 min.  No broiler time necessary.  They came out crispy and delicious.

Everyone loved these. I made a double batch. I rolled them in sugar in a bowl as someone suggested but I used way less sugar, perhaps half a cup. I roasted the first batch after sprinkling them lightly with sugar. I didn't have a problem with too much fat because I used a premium bacon. I froze the second batch then thawed them out when I needed them. These were even better than the first batch. Everyone loved these and they disappeared in no time.

These are so amazing!! I have been making these for years but with a few slight variations. I cut my pound of bacon right through the package in half, dredging each piece through light brown sugar before rolling Lil smokies up and placing in 13 X 9 glass pan. Toothpicks can be used but are not necessary. sprinkle lightly with more brown sugar and a couple of teaspoons of ground mustard. Cover, refrigerate overnight. Before heating in 375 oven for 30-45 minutes, spoon liquid from the bottom of the pan over the smokies then sprinkle lightly once more with light brown sugar. A few minutes before removing from the oven, broil to crisp up the bacon.

I cut the bacon in thirds. It crisped up much better. Also, I dredged the bacon in brown sugar before wrapping it around the smokie. Dang, these things are addicting!!

These were terrific! I also tried them with turkey bacon and it turned out great! Skewer them on to a kabob stick for easy cooking. Grill or oven.

I am giving this 5 stars BEFORE I even make it as I am so sure it will be wonderful.  I have done something like this before, but with chicken breast cut up to bite size.  I guess the thing I want to add is I bake them on a cooking rack on a foil lined jelly roll sheet...ahhh easy clean up.  Definitely gonna try the teenie wienee thing though. :)

Takes a bit of time to wrap but that can be done ahead of time.  After this, easy peasy!  Considering how simple they are and how poor the food value is they disappeared in no time!

My son just asked me to make these again for his birthday party. They're very additive. I used Splenda brown sugar blend. Regular hot dogs cut into bite size pieces work well in a pinch if you can't find smokies at your local store.

This recipe is easy and very tasty.  It takes a little bit of time to wrap each smokie, but it goes fast.  I would suggest using foil on the bottom of the sheet because the melted brown sugar and fat can be messy. Also, when they were cooked I moved them to a crockpot to keep warm and that was a very good way to serve them.

I used dark brown sugar and did not put on a skewer, just set them on a baking sheet.  They tasted great - will be making them again.

This was DELICIOUS!!  My children who are picky eaters even loved it.  It was quick simple and a great appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner.  The one thing I did a little different was I rolled the bacon in brown sugar before I wrapped it and then I rolled the smoky & bacon in brown sugar once it was wrapped and I secured it together with a tooth pick.

Made these for a Superbowl party and everyone loved them, cooked beef lil smokies with turkey bacon (not everyone at party could eat pork) and made cheddar lil smokies...the beef were better by far. Took a while for the brown sugar to melt though; I'm glad I made these early!

I made these for the Superbowl tonight and they were devoured! I took the recommendation of other reviewers and let the bacon wrapped smokies "marinate" in the brown sugar overnight.  When I was ready to cook them, I lined them on a slotted pan (to allow for the fat to drip off) and cooked them for about an hour.  They were delightfully simple & delicious!

This is a good recipe, BUT there are some KEY CHANGES that need to be made...First, line the baking sheet with wax paper. The brown sugar combined with the grease is extremely hard to get off of the baking sheet. Second, for easy service, hold each piece of bacon on the little smokie with a toothpick and set them up on the baking sheet. Third, it is important to note that it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour to make these. For more information, check out http://inspiredminute.com/bacon-wrapped-little-smokies/. These are the perfect treat for a football game or any other get-together!

Great recipe and very easy.  I roll the smokies with bacon in advance and freeze.  The day before I plan to serve the dish, I defrost in the fridge and "cake" on the brown sugar until smokies are totally covered (as recommended by another reviewer).  I then place in the fridge over night to let the brown sugar melt.  Always a hit!

These are a hit everytime I make them! I do use pepper bacon & do toss the smokies in a bowl with the brown sugar before I wrap them. After they are wrapped I sprinkle addtional brown sugar on them.

Have made this many times. Put them in a crock pot to stay warm during entertaining. Everyone loves them!!! I do line my pan with tinfoil for easy clean up and just before the bacon is totally cooked i drizzle with maple syrup. Going to roll them in maple sugar instead of brown sugar next time and see how that is! Awesome delicous recipe!

Oh. My. God. These were FANTASTIC!! I made only one package of smokies worth, and my guests were mad I didn't make more! I made these by securing the bacon with a toothpick and then smushed a fistful of brown sugar on each smokie. I have a cast iron skillet with grilling grooves that I put all the smokies on, which allowed for the fat and sugar to drip off. I cooked these at 350 for 45 minutes, and sprinkled brown sugar on them halfway through. If you are considering making these: DO IT!! You and your guests won't regret it!

These appetizers are worth the effort! They are always a big hit when I make them for parties and events. I do use a broiler pan to keep the smokies from getting drowned in grease. Yummy crowd pleaser!!

These turned out amazing, I thought at first that they would be just okay but I was completely blown away. 
The first time I tried this recipe I made it exactly as the directions described; delicious. The second time, I cut the brown sugar by half and added two teaspoons of cinnamon and it was amazing. Definitely will keep making these and putting different spins on the ingredients.

Not healthy at all, but who cares!!! So delish!! I did not use nearly 1 cup of the brown sugar though. A sprinkling before you put it in the oven and a sprinkling part way through cooking and I turned on the broiler half way through cooking to crisp everything up nicely. I also did not use toothpick, just cut the bacon to go around the smokie once and laid it on the foil lined cooking sheet with the opening down. Worked fine and then poked them all with a toothpick as I was placing them on the serving dish.

Just OK for me - maybe a little too greasy even after baking on broiler tray.

These are really good! I've had an extra package of lil smokies in my freezer for the last month, but didn't know what to do with them. I added some smoked paprika to the brown sugar for a bit of a different flavor, and then I drizzled them with maple syrup halfway through cooking.
I served them for dinner sprinkled with crushed red pepper. The maple syrup/bacon pan drippings made a really yummy sauce to drizzle over them. I may even make these again for brunch, but using breakfast sausages instead of smokies.

Haven't made these yet, but now that I've finally found it I will.  I first had these at a Thanksgiving breakfast.  My boss called them a heart attack on a stick.  :) they were so yummy!  I can't wait to make them myself!!

Made these today using the skewer/broiler method. I didn't cook them long enough. The bacon didn't get crispy. BF said they were too sweet.

These are delicious and easy to fix. You will have to make a lot because they will be gone quickly. This is like Meat Candy and a big hit with the boys.

These are delicious and easy to make. Definitely a crowd pleaser. The only modification I made was using half a strip of bacon per smokie instead of a third.

I made these pretty much exactly according to the directions and baked for 45 minutes, and then left them in the oven to stay warm for another 15 minutes or so.  I cut my bacon into thirds and it was plenty of bacon per weenie.  :)  Carried them 45 minutes to a party and they disappeared.  Everyone loved them.  I thought they were plenty sweet enough by adding the brown sugar just before putting them in to bake, but I may try the pre-sugaring that many people recommend next time.  These were SO good.  Bacon really does make everything better. :D

Wonderful!!  I followed others suggestions and used a broiling pan and plenty of extra brown sugar.  These were so so good!  I'll definitely be making these again especially during the up coming holidays.

These were great.  Very good salty/sweet combination.  Definitely put them on a higher rack in your oven though as I burned several by having it too low.

I made these for the first time for a Christmas party and everyone LOVED them!! They are SO simple to prepare and the brown sugar gives them such a good taste. They were gone in 15 minutes. I will definitely be making them for all social gatherings! Thank you for sharing!

Not worth the work on my end.  These were messy to make and clean up.  They also smoked up the whole kitchen.  The flavor was just ok too.

My oven is in Celcius and it does not have a 175 deg. celcius, only 170 or 180. The first time I used 170 but after a long time the bacon was still not crispy. The second time I did 180 but left it for too long the smokies at the corners of the pan were burnt.. Lol.. The next time I will do 180 but 40 mins only.. It was so yummy my brother had 15 or more.. Thanks for the simple yet yummy recipe!

Great, fast, easy!! Use maple bacon if you don't want brown sugar! But the sweet and salty make a perfect combo! I used the brown sugar!

Following other reviews, I tossed the sausages and bacon in a bowl of brown sugar prior to putting them together.  Refrigerated overnight and sprinkled additional brown sugar on top before baking.  I put an old cookie cooling rack inside of a lined pan to allow the fat to drain and also turned them half way through cooking so the bacon would crisp on both sides.  Took these to a Halloween party and they were gone in less than 30 minutes.

I needed a quick side dish that my husband  could prepare for parents day at  our son's fraternity.  Since he loves these he was willing to do the prep work.  He even went to the store and  bought all the supplies!  Friday night he rolled 120 smokies and Saturday morning we covered them in brown sugar and stuck them in the oven.  Once they were done we put them in a slow cooker on warm and plugged it into a car power inverter for the two hour car ride.  As you can guess they were a hit at the fraternity!  By the time we got to the buffet they were already gone!! This is a great recipe, especially if you need your husband's help with a side dish.

Yummo!  This recipe was a hit during our girls' night out.  Used maple bacon and a sprinkling of cinnamon along with the brown sugar.  Very easy to make and they smell divine while cooking!

I've done this same recipe with shrimp and the brown sugar was mixed with chili powder. It was very sticky and yes, very time consuming. I am trying this lil smokie version. The work is worth the payoff! They are a HUGE hit all the time!

These were awesome.  I thought they were going to make my oven smoke from the bacon, but they didn't.  I cooked them on a broiler pan and it really cut down on the grease.  I actually didn't think they were greasy at all.  I dipped the bacon in brown sugar before wrapping the smokie and then I sprinkled more on top.  I forgot to put foil on the bottom of the broiler pan which made for a difficult clean up.  But they were sooo delicious.  Thanks for posting.....

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because after reading all of the raving reviews and looking at all the pictures, I was expecting a 5 star taste...but, unfortunately, they were a little too greasy (which is to expect, I guess!). They did taste much better after they had cooled down...overall good recipe just not a favorite for me!

I made this recipe for my grandson's 12th birthday party in December.  It was such a success, that the 8 boys wanted more and I had only made one recipe's worth of these goodies.  EVERY boy gave me his mother's email address so I could share the recipe, which I happily did.

Try some spicey brown mustard on the smokies before you put on the brown sugar.  Kind of gives a kick!

Yummy!!!  My 11 yo son helped me make them.  He had a blast wrapping them (which works for me:)  Take the advice of the others and put foil in the pan!!  I didn't and yikes, clean up was next to impossible!  I'm making these again for our Packer/Bears party this weekend and plan on trying the dipping sauce found on this site with them (not that they need any sauce mind you).

These were excellent! I did as another reviewer suggested and baked them on my broiler pan. I also lined the bottom of my pan with tinfoil which made the mess super easy to clean up. Can't wait to try them out for a party!

No matter how many of these I make, there are never leftovers.  I never skewer them.  I just make sure the cut side of the bacon is down.  I pack them in tight in the pan and completely cover with brown sugar.  As they bake, about every 15 minutes I drain off the grease so they brown nicely all around with no turning needed.

These were sooooo good! The only problem is that they disappear soon after you place them out at a party...haha! My best piece of advice would be to let them marinate in brown sugar overnight.

These are very yummy - Thank you!  The second time I made this recipe I let them sit over night in the fridge with the brown sugar over the top of them.  Then recoated them in the sauce they made as I was puting them in the pan to cook and they turned out even better.

My daughter loved these, but I didn't care for them, so I split the difference and rated them 3 stars. I didn't expect them to be quite so sweet. I think I like the smokies better just plain.  Sorry!

Yummy!  These were the hit of the Christmas potluck dinner.  My only problem with the recipe is the clean up.  I lined cookie sheets with foil and somehow the grease and sugar managed to get underneath and burn to the cookie sheet.  Had to scrape and soak the pans.

Like those before me, my only mistake in making these, was not making enough!  These are a fabulous little appetizer, and were a huge hit at our Christmas party.  I cut my bacon in 1/3, wrapped, rolled in brown sugar and secured with a toothpick. I poured extra sugar in the dish overtop of them and let them sit overnight.  24 hours later, I put them on a broiling pan, added a bit more sugar and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  I broiled them the last few minutes, and they came out super crisp.  The broiler pan is a really great idea!  FABULOUS recipe!!!!!

Made these last night for a party, and everyone loved them!  I dipped the smokies in brown sugar than tossed more brown sugar on top during cooking.  I was in a rush to get ready so I didn't bother turning them and just let them bake for 45 min - they came out great!

These are the best! Very easy to make and everyone loved them. I made them the day before and then baked them just before I went to a street party. Needless to say I didn't have to bring any home. Will make again & again.

I made three batches of these (3 lbs of bacon and 3 packages of smokies) and had about 17 guests. That wasn't enough. They were gone in minutes! I thought I'd try these instead of your classic wrapped smokies because they would stay warm better in a crock pot but there was no point in dirtying up the crock pot because they left as quickly as they got there. Really awesome! Two suggestions, do like others and let them marinate overnight in the brown sugar and once you make "enough" double your numbers!!

I thought these were pretty tasty.  I tried them with just a little sugar and then completely drenched, and I actually liked them without all the sugar.  I personally thought that too much sugar covered the flavor of the meat.  They were pretty easy to make, and I will probably make them again.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! Went very quickly at our potluck. Very easy, inexpensive, and quick to make. Took another's suggestion by letting it marinate in brown sugar overnight, then baking it for 45 mins-1 hr next day, smothering it with the brown sugar marinade and turning the smokies over halfway through cooking.

Another reviewer described these perfectly - "Meat Candy"! I shook the smokies and bacon in a bag of brown sugar (didn't bother measuring it). A double batch of these was gone in no time!

Yummy!  This is a really unique spin on sweet sausage.  I found it to be delicious as did my coworkers.  It really is like "meat candy".  I would recommend using the pork lit'l smokies instead of the beef.  Really excellent.

This is one of the best appetizers ever!  My church group loves them, the men almost beg for them!  They make turkey smokies now too, and they still taste great.  When you wrap them in bacon and slather them in brown sugar, you can't tell the difference and it's about half the fat and calories.  Yum!!

Tasty and simple! I decided to wrap them and microwave them for three minutes on a plate with paper towels before adding the sugar to get rid of alot of bacon fat before putting them in the oven. I lined the baking sheet with foil to make clean up easier and saw no need to measure the brown sugar based on other responses indicating that more was better. I simply sprinkled it generously over the wrapped smokies. Microwaving them first also hepled the bacon take the shape of the smokie and stay well wrapped, but they still took about 45 minutes to bring the bacon to an adequate level of doneness. That being said, everyone loved them and they went so fast that I didn't get a chance to take a picture, but I will be making these again! The only drawback was the length of time required in the oven. These are a very forgiving combination, so I will try a slightly higher oven temperature next time. Thank you for posting this recipe. Yum!

Served these at my Super Bowl party, and they were scarfed up in minutes!  I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked the wrapped smokies in the microwave for about a minute and a half before baking to cut back on some of the grease. After microwaving I placed them in a shallow dish and covered them very liberally with brown sugar and baked for 30 minutes.  These will definitely be on the list for upcoming parties.  Thanks for a great recipe!

In a word...Delicious!!  Made for my superbowl party and was the first appetizer to go!  Followed recipe exactly and was very pleased with results.  I did assemble them the day before and sprinkled with brown sugar...then more brown sugar before baking...this recipe is a keeper!

They tasted great ! Followed many of the hints in the reviews , but no way I was going to go to this much trouble, not to mention the mess. So rather than waste the smokies I did the following & made Orange Glazed Smokies. Took the brown sugar juice from the plastic bag they were soaking in, & put in a sauce pan added juice from 2 oranges, 1 Tbsp A/P flour , 2 Tbsp mustard & 1Tbsp vinegar. Brought to a boil then simmered 20 minutes. Could also put in a small crock-pot. This was delish & I got request for the recipe.

I always prepare these a day ahead of time, and let them marinate in a huge freezer bag in the fridge over night.  I bake them the morning of the game, and they are the first things gone at our tailgate parties.  This recipe is one of my favorites for game days in the Grove at Ole Miss.

Perfect for a football party!  The recipe should say these take about 30 to 35 minutes to bake so the bacon turns crispy.  To keep warm, put in a crock pot uncovered.

Made them twice over the holidays.  Everyone LOVED them.  Cokked them in a diposable pan and cleanup was a breeze. Thick cut bacon was great.  Drained midway thru and turned.  Used extra brown sugar. yum

These are yummy. They do take a long time to cook if you want the bacon crisp so just take that into account. I did not use skewers as it just seemed unnecessary. I used a regular sided pan covered with tin foil and just poured off the fat into a can every 20 minutes or so. I also took the advice of others and rolled the smokies in brown sugar then wrapped in center cut bacon... sprinkled heavily with brown sugar and refridgerated overnight til I was ready to bake. YUMMY

Must have for our annual Christmas party!  Husband and father-in-law always like them a few days ahead also!!!  Make ahead to save yourself time.  Just wrap with bacon...slather in brown sugar (the more the better) and put in plastic baggie and refrigerate.  Not need to put on skewers.  Do, however, line baking sheet with foil.  Makes a big sticky mess is you don't!

Just the combo of bacon and smokies is a great flavor.  Forgot to add the brown sugar on most of the smokies but when I did, the brown sugar didn't work well for me. It mostly fell off and burned hard on the baking sheet before the bacon got crisp.

VERY YUMMY!!  I made a double batch that would fill the crockpot completely.  This made baking a little more difficult because I had to seperate onto two pans.  I put them in at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then swaped the top and bottom pan for an additional 20 minutes. They turned out nice and crisp this way!

I can't believe I forgot to review this.  I had RAVE reviews about this and I have never had any left over.  Every time I make them - no matter how many - they are always all gone.  No additions... perfect as is.  I would mention that these pretty much need to be made the day of because when I let them sit over night, the sugar turns to syrup and sort of runs off.  Oh, and ****use foil on your baking sheet**** for a very very easy cleanup.  Otherwise you'll have to scrub and scrub to get the sugar off.

These were Great!! I think I was most tickled by the fact that 1pkg of smikies fit perfectly on my broiler pan (LOL).Definitely line the bottom of the pan and spray the top with cooking spray before adding smokies. I served with the Brown-Sugar Smoky Dip from AR and they were fab!

This is one of the best party recipes ever! I've never baked them though-just toothpick them and toss them in the crock pot for around 3 hours. The bacon comes out nice and chewy and they are drenched in the sugar glaze. I have brought them to many parties but never brought any back home!

Great recipe!  They were easy!  In fact I served them for a party with a handful of other appetizers and these were by far the favorite appetizer!!!I served them with some chopped chives and drizzled honey mustard and small bits of fresh pineapple.  I will make again!

Unbelievable! Very, very rich. A huge hit at my party. Put them on a cooling rack which was set on top of a baking dish with foil. All the grease dripped down. One great tip for turning: I put another cooling rack on top and then flipped the whole thing at once.

For Xmas Eve, I made them a couple days ahead of time. Once brown enough took out the toothpicks and plan on putting them back end once finished on Xmas Eve. Sprinkled the brown sugar after done so that when warming them back up on Xmas Eve they will burn appropriately and not burn and then I will put the toothpicks back in. Serving with BBQ sauce.

These we SO good!  I typically make brown sugar bacon for football games, but wanted to turn it up for this year's Super Bowl.  These were a hit!  We borrowed someone else's nickname of "pig candy" and called them "Pittsburgh Pig Candy."  :-)  Served with the sauce from this site.  Delicious!  Huge hit!

These were great and super easy to make.  My 8 yr old ate them like they were going out of style.  I will definitely make again.  I found it easier to put the smokies on the skewers than roll them in some brown sugar, rather than sprinkle it over them.  Was just enough.  They were Great!  TY

So good. Good advice to put on toothpicks soaked in water. I used dark brown sugar too. I put them in a bag to create the sugar syrup like other suggested. I did convection on my oven which I think crisped them up better and faster. The suggested dipping sauce of chili sauce, mayo, and brown sugar was good.

These were very very good.....I didn't think I'd like the brown sugar but the other reviewers were right.  The more brown sugar the better.  I did these on individual toothpicks and dusted them twice with brown sugar.  My only gripe is that they didn't get quite as crispy as I'd like them to even after baking them for 45 min.  Next time I'll move them from the oven to the broiler for a few mins to crisp them up a little more.

Turkey Bacon!!  That's all I have to say.  It makes for less of a mess (no yucky clumps of grease to clean up) and you don't even have to use a broiler pan.  Just put them on a cookie sheet instead.  Delicious!! :)

Hello I have been making these for years but I mix coarse ground mustard to the brownsugar to the mix and then bake as usual. They are awesome and they go so fast...Try for a change of pace, you won't regret it..

I have made these many times - in fact just this past weekend I taught my 2 granddaughters (age 8 & 6 1/2) to make them.  Good for appetizers or a nice brunch.

This is a great appetizer recipe.  I tried it with sausage and with little hot dogs.  The sausage had the better flavor.  It definitely is worth it to put all the smokies together (smothering them in brown sugar and putting them in a pan or bowl) a day or morning ahead and let them make their own syrup and then pour the syrup over them before baking.  I also found it easier to put them together onto individual tooth picks instead of a skewer.

This recipe is simple and delicious! I made these for the first time for Thanksgiving with my family. My fiance, (who initially argued that lil smokies were only good when simmered in BBQ sauce in the crockpot,) loved these SO MUCH that he ate about 1/3 of them before we even left the house to go to my mother's! The only thing that I changed was that I put the little smokies in a zip lock bag along with the brown sugar before wrapping in bacon. I shook them up in the bag until all of the smokies were covered, then once wrapped in bacon, I used the rest of the brown sugar to coat the tops of the smokies after placing them on a baking sheet. Don't be afraid to get crazy with the brown sugar. It makes the smokies juicy and sweet!

Delish!! I made this for a candle party I recently had over the weekend and this was the first thing to go. I did like some of the other people and prepared it the nite before, and I brown sugared the bacon and smokies and wrapped them up and placed in a bowl over nite and covered with saran wrap. In the morning the brownsugar turned into a glaze. I used a cookie sheet and put foil over it and sprayed with Pam. Then I placed the smokes wrapped in bacon on the cookie sheet. I then poured about 2 table spoons of honey in the mixture and stirred it. Then I got a brush and I generously applied the mixture over the smokies. I baked on 350degrees for about 3-40mins until the bacon became crisp. I used toothips to serve. It was easier. This was so yummy. Thanks for the recipe

I take these to potlucks and parties.  They are always a big hit, and  I never get away without someone wanting the recipe!

I cut the bacon strips in half instead of thirds, so that they are long enough to wrap.  I also coat the smokies and bacon in brown sugar before wrapping (in addition to spinkling the sugar on after.)  

I puy them in a little croc pot after they are cooked.  This keeps them warm and helps the sugar carmalize.

Delicious!  I used the slow cooker to make these last night for Fight Night.  I used more brown sugar than the recipe calls for, and I'm happy I did.  I rolled and sprinkled the smokies in the brown sugar to make sure they were really coated.
everyone at the party LOVED them!  I will definitely make again and again.

These were awesome!  I made a double batch of them for Euchre night a few weeks ago.  By the end of the evening, they were almost completely gone.  I prepared them earlier in the day and just put them in the oven before guests arrived.  Great for playing cards since they were on toothpicks....didn't get our hands dirty :-)

These are delicious!!  I admit, I was a little skeptical about wrapping bacon around the little smokies but it really does work.  They are even better after they sit for a bit and the glaze gets crunchy.  Yum!!

This was a tasty recipe but not worth the work and mess.  It took a lot of time to wrap each smokie and then when baking it the sugar burned and made a big mess in the pan even though I covered it with aluminum foil.  If you don't mind the time and the mess it tastes very good.

These were really good; I guess what's not to like about salty pork, wrapped in salty pork baked with sugar?  They aren't over-the-top phenomenal, but they are addicting and disappeared really quickly when I made them for friends.

Delicious. Really not that messy. Poured all the brown sugar into a bowl along with the bacon and the smokies, wrapped em up and baked! No need to broil, after they sat a few minutes they were fine. Will definitely make again for future parties! Mmmmm....

I really don't understand why everyone gave these 4 and 5 stars...I did not care for this.  I made them just as the recipe suggested but I had to broil them to get the bacon crisp.  They were too sweet, greasy.  I am thankful I made them for home before ever making any for my friends or family.  My husband (who eats most everything) ate maybe 8 and said I could "throw the rest away" which I will.

These were spectacular!  So simple, yet full of flavor!  You can't beat bacon and brown sugar.  Like other reviewers, I inserted a toothpick on each smokie instead of putting a bunch on a skewer.  Be prepared for these to go quickly!

I rolled mine and placed in a crockpot to cook - like another reviewer suggested.  That didn't work for me.  The bacon was slimy and they were sitting in grease.  
I did some others in the oven, as directed, and they were much better - however I couldn't taste much of the brown sugar that I had sprinkled on top.
I do want to make these again - because both my son and I really enjoyed them - I think I will try coating my bacon with brown sugar as suggested in other reviews.

These were good.. but not worth the effort.  Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad at all, but if you have a lot of other food that's really good, these just don't shine like many of the reviews said they would, and I took recommendations from many of the other reviews.  TIP: If you are going to make them and you have a toaster oven, I would definitely use it. It crisped the bacon faster than the oven.  I was happy I didn't have to wait for the regular oven... especially during a party and at a time when you need the oven for other things.

These are scrumptious! I used extra brown sugar and marinated overnight per previous suggestions. Everyone at my Christmas Eve Party loved them! Be careful when keeping the warm in the crock they tend to dry out by the end of the night. Still YUM-O!

I had these at a party several months ago and loved them!  So, I made them yesterday for a New Year's party and they were a huge hit.  I was really running late, with barely enough time for cooking (which was about 30-40 minutes for me, not 20 minutes as suggested in the recipe description), so I just dumped the smokies into a bowl of brown sugar (try not to get the juice from the smokie bag into the brown sugar).  The smokies had some juice on them so the brown sugar stuck to them.  I mixed it all around and then wrapped them with the bacon and stuck them with the toothpick.  I was too cheap to buy center-cut bacon, so I picked up some regular and I really regretted it.  Several pieces were almost pure fat and that made it hard for them to crisp up.  You definately don't want these to be soggy.  Using the broiling pan is not necessary if you have very low fat bacon, you don't want to loose your sugar down the holes too, but using it is a very good idea for fatty bacon.  Also, I agree with all who suggested tin foil lining on the bottom pan for catching the grease.  Oh, and we turned on the broiler for the last 3-5 minutes fo cooking to get that final attempt to crisp up.  In the end they worked out fine.  I made up 2 full packages and only got to eat the 1 I tried at home, the rest were gone before I got up to the food table!  So easy to make, just be prepared for a possible long cooking time trying to get the bacon to crisp.

I made these for my last two parties and they were devoured!  My brother-in-law, who is a selective eater, loved these... that's says something!  My only change is that instead of just sprinkling the brown sugar on the bacon-wrapped smokies, I lightly sprayed them with cooking spray and put them in a gallon-sized Ziplock bag with brown sugar and shook the bag to coat.  Gives better coverage, and it makes cleanup easy.  Highly recommended!

So easy! Everyone gobbled them up - ages ranged from 5 yrs to 80.  I didn't have a the dilemma everyone is talking about with the brown sugar -- don't make these difficult! I lined my pan with foil and just sprinkled the sugar on top of my skewered little smokies wrapped in bacon.  They are fabulous. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  We made for a college age holiday party and everyone agreed that it was the best appetizer out there.

I was looking for a different appetizer and focused on this one. It reminded me of another favorite, bacon wrapped chestnuts. In preparing this recipe, I followed several suggestions. I cooked them using a foil lined broiler pan for ease of cleanup (worked great), and I used the dipping sauce (1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. chili sauce, 1/2 c. brown sugar; delicious). I liked the fact that the broiling pan drained off all the grease. I turned them only once to be sure they were crisp all over. After taking them from the oven, I had to taste one right away, and my initial opinion was they were just okay. I then let them set while I cleaned up the kitchen and made ready for guests. Just before presenting them, I reheated them for 15-20 minutes in the oven and served them with the dipping sauce. I thought they were much better after reheating them. All the guests enjoyed them.

Yes, they are messy to make but I agree that they are so well worth it.
They are a must have at our BUNCO parties.

These are Awesome! I made them for a bridal shower, then the bride requested them again for the wedding reception. Everyone raved about them. Couldn’t get enough. Even though there weren’t very many left, the few that survived were excellent warmed up.

Update - I was one of the very few that gave this recipe a poor rating, but I knew I had to try again.  The first time I used leaner bacon (as suggested by reviewers) and followed the recipe exactly.  I now know that when using lean bacon it is essential to allow time to marinate. There wasn't enough fat in the bacon to melt the sugar. Original - The whole reason I got this recipe is because about 2 years ago someone made these at the office and they were incredible.  I remember specifically she said "cocktail weiners, bacon, and brown sugar" - so I figured this was it.  Hers were saucy and flavorful.  Mine were dry, hard, and the sugar didn't melt.  So I know these CAN be good, but mine were not.

These really are excellent, and everyone loves them. I was a little worried about all of that brown sugar but if you can always adjust it to suit your tastes. I sure didn't bother threading them all on skewers. I put them in a 13x9 glass baking dish (so much easier to clean then a metal pan) sprinkled on the brown sugar, cooked until the bacon was crisp, turned them over, sprinkled more brown sugar and cooked that side. I can't figure out how some people couldn't get their bacon crisp, unless they had them squashed together on skewers and had them squashed together in the pan. I guess if I were having a party or taking them to one, then maybe I would use the skewers .. but I love shortcuts in the kitchen.

Quite a tasty and easy recipe!  I cooked my smokies with turkey bacon and actually cut each slice in half, using half a slice of bacon per each smokie.  (I am sure that 1/3 would have tasted just as good.)  Before I would roll the smokie into the bacon, I sprinkled quite a bit of brown sugar, as everyone seemed to recommend ample amount of brown sugar.  Also, I ended up cooking them in the oven for about thirty minutes, turning them half way in the baking process, to ensure full coverage.

I took some advice from here and rolled the bacon in the brown sugar and then sprinkled more on top.  The people at my dinner party fondly refer to these as "meat candy". I always wrap the cookie sheet in foil for easy clean up!

These are a huge hit with everyone!  Very quick and easy.  They are the first thing gone at all the parties.  If you cook them on a large stoneware piece there is no need to use foil.  Cleanup is a breeze.

Oh my god! These are so yummy.  I made a double batch for the superbowl and they were gone in a flash.  Make sure you line your pan with foil.  I made that mistake the first time and it took some time to clean.  You can also use less sugar if it seems like a lot, we cut it in half and they still were great. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

My niece made these for a Christmas party this year and hers came out better than mine usually do.  She used a casserole dish just big enough to hold them all touching loosely.  I think having them closer together kept the moisture in better.

I made these with center cut bacon cut in half and used toothpicks.  I made them the night before and then sprinkled on more brown sugar before baking.  They are SO GOOD!  As other reviewers have written, line your pan with foil first for easy cleanup.

I made these for my husbands work party we threw, and they seemed to be a hit, they were all gone by the end of the night!  I made them before the party to test the recipe, and my kids gobbled them up.  The second time I made them, I did make them in the throw away pans, and I spread brown sugar in the bottom of the pan, and then sprinkled them with more brown sugar, they were just as good, and a lot faster to make!  I will make them again, the only problem I had was keeping them warm, I tried the crock pot idea, and some of the bacon came off, and it just wasn't as good as when they first came out of the oven.

These were a hit at my party. I would only have one minor change, buy lean bacon. The bacon grease was overwhelming. Also, use sharp toothpicks, my husband bought flat toothpicks and it made it a little difficult.

These are the most simple looking appetizer, but boy, do they go fast! Make sure you do a lot of these for your party- because they were the first things gone out of an entire spread of appetizers. Surprising, but very good. It is worth the effort that goes into making them. Make sure to use a broiler pan lined with foil- it makes clean up much easier.

Yum!!! You can't go wrong with this one.  The suggestion of preapering them ahead of time was great.  Not only they taste better, but also can have them ready ahead of time.  Also baking them on parchment paper was a great idea.  Thank you:)

What a HIT, both with me the chef(because it was so so simple to put together) and my guests just loved them!  I cut the entire bag of bacon in thirds with a pair of scissors and took the advice of others to dredge the smokies and marinate them over night.  Before baking I again sprinkled with brown sugar.(The best advice was to line the baking sheet what a nighmare that would have been had I not!  I was scepticle because of there being only 3 ingredients, but they were gobbled up!

YUM!!  Took this to a couples shower and they were a hit.  My only suggestions is to pre-cook them like other people said because the bacon produces a lot of grease.  I would then re-heat them with the brown suger and I think they would be perfect.  I also lined my baking sheets with parchment paper and clean up was a snap!

I served this at a party recently, and everyone loved them! I only made 1/3 of the recipe since I wasn't expecting many people; boy was I surprised when they all disappeared within minutes! I was worried they'd be a little too "meaty," but they tasted AWESOME! 

Easy to roll the sausage & bacon in advance; just sprinkle the brown sugar on and throw 'em in the oven when you're ready to serve. I did end up putting the broiler on for a couple of minutes at the end, though; the bacon took over 20 minutes to get crisp at 350 degrees and I wanted to get back to the party. I imagine these would be perfect for a Super Bowl party. The aroma drove my guests wild while they were cooking.

These were terrific. The kids and adults loved them. The brown sugar burned on my cookie sheet making clean up a big pain. When I make these again, I will line my cookie sheet with heavy aluminum foil or better yet use a throw away cookie sheet. Also because the sugar burned, my fire alarm went off and my guests became concerned about a kitchen fire! I think I'll cook them ahead and then warm them up so not to alarm my guests!!

You can also wrap the bacon pieces around those little miniature corn cobs--some smokies, some corn, it's a party..!

We made these for New Year's Eve and they were gone in no time.  Everyone enjoyed this one.  I used toothpicks and made individual ones instead of the skewers.  I soaked my toothpicks in water and they came out looking good and tasted great!

Very good flavor.  They took me about 30 minutes to put together.  I marinated them in the brown sugar for 8 hours.  I wouldn't recommend broiling, as some suggested (mine were overdone), but I would recommend baking for longer than stated in the recipe.

YUM! Just for fun, I made these for dinner for me and my husband. Between the two of us, we ate almost all of them! Per other reviews, I dredged the bacon and smokies in brown sugar before wrapping, then let them "marinate" for a few hours. I cooked them for 25 minutes, then broiled for 5. Also, to save my cookie sheets, I cooked them on a rack and lined the cookie sheets with foil to catch those sticky drippings.

OMG, these were dilicious! This is the second time I'm made them. The first time I way over cooked them but this time I all but stood in front of the oven and watched them cook. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them on a foil lined broiler for ten minutes, sprinkled with more brown sugar and then turned them over for five minutes, then I removed them to a shallow oven proof dish, added more brown sugar and broiled for approx. 3-5 minutes and then turned them over and broiled approx. 2 more minutes. Mmmmmm, super delicious! Thanks so much for sharing!

My kids couldn't get enough of these. I added a lot more brown sugar and cooked them 10 minutes, then flipped them and cooked another 10 minutes. Served them with BBQ sauce for dipping. Lining the tray with foil is an excellent idea!

This has become one of those junkie junk foods that I crave. It is a great appetizer. I use the pre-cooked bacon slices (1/2 slice for each smokie), which is much less greasy and requires less cooking time, but still more than the 10 minutes the recipe states. I've even done it in the microwave (with the pre-cooked bacon) for a "quick fix."

This was the first thing to go at a recent potluck - Delicious!   I made it with the sauce from Bacon Water Chestnut Rolls (also on this site), and I think it made it that much better.

Soooo simple, and they were gone in (I'm not kidding) less than 10 minutes.  I skewered them on individual toothpicks, spread them in a shallow pan and sprinkled about 1 1/2 cups brown sugar all over.  I crisped them under the broiler for a few minutes at the end of the baking time as others have suggested, and they were great!

These were awsome,and it takes a lot to impress me. Will definitely make again! I've now made these several times.  They're now my husband's favorite appetizer.  Last time I served with a side of barbeque for dipping, and everyone thought it added another great flavor.

Still,making these time and time again. Always gone in an instant, even the ladies can't stop eating them. Last week I made them for a group of five ladies and they were all gone!

Kick butt!!  This is awesome.  Note of warning, if you or someone you love is planning on drinking heavily, stay away from this.  Othewise, this is a great pary food.  It is a little time consuming, and bacon is not the funnest food to play with, but well worth it.

dip smokies in a bowl of aunt jemima syrup, roll them in the brown sugar and wrap them in a small piece of bacon secured with skewer or toothpick.  let them sit in refrigerator for atleast an hour then bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes depending on how crispy you like your bacon.  if you're complaining about the calorie intake,  you shouldn't be eating these anyways.  they won't last 30 minutes,  they're that delicious.

These were FANTASTIC when made just as the instructions tell you to do so !!!! I intended to put the bacon and little weinies in a plastic bag the night before and allow them to soak in the brown sugar (as many recommended to do in the Reviews section) however, I forgot to do so and just sprinkled it on before baking.  I served them as an appetizer at our cocktail party and people couldn't stop RAVING about how delicious they were and they were GONE before I knew it !!!!  THANK YOU for a "no-brainer", easy recipe that even I can't screw up !!!!  Off the hook DELISH !!!!!

So simple to make, but sooooooo delicious! We make these for Christmas and my family devours them. Get the little smokies early because sometimes the stores run out of them!

I am SO tired of making these... but I can't go anywhere without them now! I always at least double the recipe, and they're always gone within minutes. To save time, I wrap the smokies in bacon and cover them in sugar the night before, cover in plastic wrap. The morning of, remove the wrap and pop them in the oven! They always take about 45 minutes for me, but I like my bacon crisp :-)

I literally burned these, and I STILL received compliments for how great they were!  They were all gone halfway through the night.  I kind of felt bad for the other people who made dishes and didn't burn them, as I did a poor job but they still tasted great.  I also made the sauce others have suggested using the chili sauce, mayo, and brown sugar.  I probably could have intentionally set them on fire and they still would have been good.  Trust me when I say that people will love these if you make them.  What I did was pre-wrap the smokies with the bacon, rolled them in the brown sugar, and left them in a covered bowl in the fridge overnight.  Then I put them in the oven on a broiler pan for 45 minutes.  My mistake was that I set the broiler on high when it probably should have been on low.  Or on oven mode at 350F.  Whatever.  I was still bewildered at how well-received these were.  Probably the best thing I've ever made.  You will undoubtedly make them better than I did.  And, if you did, you may also receive certain "favors" for your work.  You never know.  Just make these if you're going to a party.  They're easier, cheaper, and tastier than any of the frozen hors d'oeuvres that you'd buy at the store.  Don't embarrass or disappoint yourself; just make these smokies.  Quit fooling yourself!  This is all you need to bring to that party.  Wait, are you turning back and searching for another recipe?  Stop that.  Just make these.

These are a big hit and so yummy.  Also added a strip of Jalapeño pepper beside the smokie to be wrapped up by the bacon.  And don't skimp on the brown sugar. Last time I made this I couldn't find small smokies or cocktail wieners. I used a couple of different types of sausages and just cut them to size. Added to the flavour so I think I will do that again!!

UPDATE: I decided to change up my recipe a bit and cook these awesome bites at 400 for 20 minutes. I also sprinkled brown sugar and whiskey on top before baking too. I highly advise this combination! 

OLDER: These were amazing! Everyone at the party loved them from age 2 through 50! Only change I made was upping the temperature after the initial 10 minutes at 350 to 400. This made them crisp up perfectly. I cooked mine for about 25 minutes total. Also, if you use wooden (bamboo) skewers, you don't need to spray them with non-stick spray first. The bacon provides plenty of grease to slide off. However, I would advise lining a glass baking pan in foil and then spraying the foil with non-stick spray before laying the little brown sugar piglets on them!

Made these for a couple of SuperBowls and they NEVER last! They disappear after no more than 5 minutes. Once, they got grabbed as soon as I pulled them out of the oven! They are now popular by request.

Made these when we had company coming over, and they were a hit! I'd even say they were a homerun. I baked them at 350 for about 50 minutes on a dark baking tray, flipping them about halfway through.

I made these for a party recently.  Whenever I make a new recipe, I always do everything exactly as written then make notes on what I would do different next time.  I wouldn't change a thing.  These were gobbled up by the teenagers at the party.  Everyone loved them.

Excellent oven roasted brisket. Perfectly juicy, tender, and flavorful. If you drain out the juices of the brisket at the 1 hour mark, it makes for a drier (but still moist and flavored) brisket! Awesome, will be making this again.

This recipe makes a lot of weenies! I had some difficulty sprinkling the brown sugar so that it wouldn't cook and burn on the pan. I would recommend cooking at a higher temperature, 400 degrees, so as to crisp up the bacon quicker. My husband liked them, but my son and I felt that we were eating something really decadent due to the protein and fat content. I probably won't make them again.

I made this for 12 men at pool league. Needless to say the cooker came home empty! Instead of using just brown sugar, I incorporated Wynne's Spiced Bacon Twist recipe spices (also a recipe to die for) and upped the cayenne to a rounded quarter teaspoon for a tad more kick.  Made them the night before in the oven.  Popped them in the slow cooker and the day of heated them through a couple hours on low. Two batches made half a 5 quart slow cooker. Next time I will quadruple this recipe for a full slow cooker.

Made this yumminess for the SuperBowl and it was amazing.
There were just three of us, but almost all of these were GONE.
I followed the recipe but used regular bacon, partially frozen for ease of cutting. The amount of bacon matched the amount of smokies perfectly. I coated both sides of the bacon in dark brown sugar before wrapping and assembled all of them - no toothpicks needed - in 20 minutes. Very messy. The brown sugar seemed to melt off in enough time, so I applied a light dusting when I took them out of the oven for turning.  I lined a roasting pan with foil and used a disposable grill rack I found. I also used soaked, long disposable bamboo skewers and threaded the doggies on that, as per the video. The double side of sugar "glued" the bacon on, although a few became loose. I cooked for 30 minutes at 350 and then blasted them for 10 mins at 40 to crisp up the bacon. The bacon didn't get super crispy as I had to take them out because the sugar drippings started to burn on the bottom of the pan. I might try give them a shot under the broiler at the end next time.
These were DELICIOUS. We kept giggling and making happy noises as we ate them, they were so darn good. Will make again ~ FOR SURE. Perhaps will try some cayenne with the brown sugar next time. Thanks!

Made these for a Super Bowl party and they were just as good as everyone said.  We baked them at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.  We sprinkled the brown sugar pretty generously. We baked them on a bakers half sheet pan lined with foil and used a rack to allow the grease to drip away from our bacon wrapped bundles of yumminess.  We were lazy, so we didn't flip them at all.  They came out fine and clean up was minimal.  We also made the mayo and chili sauce dip that was mentioned in a previous review.  We added a generous squirt of sriracha to give it a little snap.  We couldn't turn them out fast enough.  These were definitely the stars of the half-time show!

Easy and simple! I could have done even more brown sugar - don't think I went with the full amount, but they turned out delicious nonetheless. I wound up cooking for about 25 minutes, removing the grease from the ban and cooking for another 25 minutes or so. would definitely recommend using a rack to make sure your bacon stays crispy and doesn't cook in grease! great recipe and very simple - only 3 ingredients!!

These are great except that they never last more than a few minutes! I did take some advice from another review and "dredged" the bacon and the smokies before I wrapped them. I did not use skewers or toothpicks until I was getting them out of the pan.  I also put them on a plate with paper towels and popped them in the microwave for 90 seconds before putting them in the pan and it cut down on cooking time.  I baked them ten minutes and sprinkled sugar, baked ten more minutes and then put it on broil for about 5 minutes to crisp bacon.  Everybody goes CRAZY for them!

I made these for Christmas for my in-laws and was a little nervous since this was the first time making these. Everyone LOVED THEM! Especially the guys, but the women also liked them just as much. I took the advise of other reviewers and let the bacon and smokies marinate in the brown sugar over night. In order to prevent a mess at my sister in-laws house, I put foil on baking sheet and placed the wrapped smokies on a cookie rack on top of the cookie sheet and baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.Right before popping them in the oven I sprinkled more brown sugar on top. They came out perfect and not greasy since they were placed on the rack for the bacon drippings. I will definitely keep this recipe as my "go to" appetizer recipe in the future.

What is there not to like?  Bacon + brown sugar???  Pretty darn good.  And easy to do.
Followed recipe exactly.  Secured bacon with a toothpick and placed them on a broil pan with the bottom foiled lined (super easy clean up).  Cooked about 15 min EACH side - until the sugar was melted and gooey and the bacon was sizzling.  
These were a huge hit Christmas Day and I'll be making them again.

I cooked these for 2 hours on high in my slow cooker (with no tooth picks) and they turned out great.  I  put toothpicks in them before serving just for easy clean eating.   I have a busy 2 year old so the less clean up the better!

These are delicious. One problem with the directions, though. Using a baking sheet is a terrible idea. The grease flowed off and started an oven fire. Not a big deal, but certainly not good. I would use a broiling pan or some other pan with edges to catch the grease.

I LOVE this recipe also but I make it even better by adding a small amount of chili powder (seasoning) to the brown sugar...shake together and coat the smokies and bacon.  It gives this recipe an extra layer of flavor!

Very disappointing after the great review.  This took a long time to prepare and had to bake for over 45 minutes!! So were not done when my guest arrived which left me scrambling.  They were just so ordinary....I would not make them again.

Made this for a new years party and everyone loved it, so easy to make. sweet and salty. My husband is not a big smokies or hot dog person but he loved these. Wrapped in bacon and topped with brown sugar, how can you go wrong? It was delicious

I made these yesterday for our Superbowl party. I did put them - individually wrapped with a toothpick through each one, on a cookie cooling rack so the grease could fall through...kind of like a George Foreman grille. It worked perfectly and with the foil below, cleanup was a snap. 45 minutes in the oven at 350. And while the rack was a mess, with a little hot water, it too was clean as a whistle. I would have to admit, these are not the healthiest treats! Salt, Preservative, Sugar and Fat...Yum...about the only thing worth eating was the tooth pick!!  But, none the less, they were all gone in a flash. And I have to say they were just as good cold as hot.

Made this for our new years party - it was gone in a flash. Everyone loved it! Used thick cut bacon from the deli and cooked on a broiling pan so the grease drained. Let them sit in the mixture overnight before cooking. Someone else made a similar recipe for the party but they put it in a pan and it was greasy... everyone liked this version better!

Always a party hit! I've made this recipe for years. I like it, but it's crazy greasy and high in fat. The next time I make it I will try turkey lil smokies and turkey bacon. Wish me luck!

These were a great hit.  The only thing we did to help the bacon wrap a bit better was to stick it in the freezer for like half hour to help it 'firm' up a bit after cutting them up.  By doing this, it seemed to help make it a bit easier to wrap that yummy bacon around it.  Definately have this in my 'to do again' list.

Excellent. The men licked the plate clean, the women not so much. I took the advice of another reviewer and marinated them all day, used the ingredients as written. A real man pleaser. I lined a sheet with foil hoping for an easy cleanup but the sugar stuck to it and I had a time of it getting the baked on sugar off the pan--suggested using a throwaway foil pan for this to make clean up a breeze.

I make these all the time but use the pre-cooked bacon cut in half!  Makes the cooking time shorter and the clean-up a heck of a lot easier!

I made these last night for New Year's Eve and my family RAVED about them!  They were seriously gone in 60 seconds!  I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes, but needed to finish them off in the broiler because the bacon was still not crispy and the brown sugar wasn't quite melted.  These will definitely be added to my hot appetizer repertoire!

Made these for a gathering. Easy. They went fast. A perfect finger food. I served them on toothpicks. Broiled them for a just a bit when I put the brown sugar on.

This was delicious, my husband devoured it. I dipped the bacon in the brown sugar on both sides first before rolling around the smokies, and put together individually with toothpicks instead of skewers. I then very lightly sprinkled some brown sugar. I baked about 20 minutes on each side, and broiled for a few minutes at the end. I used a broiler pan with the rack so that the smokies would not sit in all that fat. It came out great, and stayed delicious all evening in the crockpot.

The men loved these!  I skewered with toothpicks and ended up turning up the heat to broil to crisp the bacon.  Flipped them to get both sides crisped.  I prefer pigs in a blanket, but the guys overruled me!  Thanks for sharing.

Omg what a mess! Brown sugar after baking maybe but during? The brown sugar burned along with the hot dogs. I even used parchment paper and drained grease from bacon. I would have been much better off to fry them in a pan after wrapping them and flip them over. Same thing. I did this with my second batch and they turned out alright. Not something I will be making again. So disappointed...

I've never made them with lil' smokies but I have used brown and serve sausages. You do the exactly the same thing. Roll each sausage in half slice of bacon, roll them in brown sugar. Bake them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until the bacon is crisp. It's great for breakfast. I make them for Christmas brunch and my family eats them all thru the day until they are gone.

I attempted to make these lil smokies but i had a problem with the brown sugar burning. Not sure what im doing wrong as i have followed the directions. After reading many of the reviews i am not doing anything different. Is it the cookie sheet i using? The smokies that werent burned were delicious...

Wow, never thought smokies would be on my list of appetizers but these are amazing... The trick is to roll with the bacon the night before and right before putting in the oven roll in the brown sugar.

Wow, Wow, and Oh Wow. These were so great. My smokies were such a hit. Everyone was wanting more. I must admit, I never liked smokies myself until I tried this fantastic recipe of yours and I can't tell you enough about how good they are. Now it's the first thing on my list not just for holidays but just because I crave them so much . Thankyou for sharing such a fantastic recipe, you helped me make my holidays a hit!!!. It's always first on my holiday menu without fail. And the greatest thing is you can't mess them up, it's foolproof.

I cooked these for our holiday party for work and they were a HIT! I used a mix of the regular Hillshire Farms smokies and the cheesy Hillshire Farms smokies, wrapped them with MAPLE bacon instead, did the layering of them with brown sugar in the crockpot and set it on high for 2 hours, rotating after 1 hour to ensure even cooking, and they came out so moist and delicious!! Definitely a must-try with the maple bacon :-) great recipe!!

I have bacon and little smokies on my shopping list again today!  I want more of these little packages of yumminess!  I recently took some of these to a gathering I attended, and they disappeared quickly.  You probably really do need to make double what you think you'll need!  I did put these on a little rack so they wouldn't be swimming in bacon grease, and I was very liberal with the brown sugar.  They are really good at room temperature.  Yum!

This was a hit at my boyfriends birthday party!  They all went...and FAST.  The shopping list is short and they are super easy to make.  There was melted brown sugar on the pan after I took off the skewers, so I drizzeled it over the finished smokies.  It took about 40 minutes to get the bacon crisp.  I will be making these for every party I have or go to from now on.

One of 3 appetizers we made for a party of 12 people. Made 2 packages (approx 70 smokies), and guests were disappointed there weren't more. Had a hard time finding smokies at grocery stores (New Jersey), but found 4 different varieties in grocery section at Walmart (in Pennsylvania). CHEDDAR SMOKIES were far tastier than regular beef variety. Used hickory flavored bacon, cut into thirds. Poured half a bag of dark brown sugar into a baking dish and dredged each piece of bacon, making sure to press generous amounts of brown sugar onto each side before wrapping around smoky. Used wooden bbq skewers, leaving just enough space between smokies to ensure they didn't stick together. Placed skewers on broiler pan on center rack in oven at 375 degrees, approx 12 min on each side. Removed from skewers and placed toothpicks for easy handling by guests. As a dipping sauce, quadrupled topping from Easy Meatloaf recipe from this site: 1 1/3C Catsup, 1/2C deli mustard, a couple of tablespoons brown sugar.

Wow!  This was a big hit at my hubbies work.  They are already asking for more!  Great recipe. The only thing I tried different was not soaking the bacon in the brown sugar.  I still marinated the smokies overnight and wrapped the bacon around before baking.  I agree with some other reviews to place the smokies on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet while baking.  Sooo Good!

Made these just last night for the hubby's birthday, he loved them.  Very easy to make, I did flip halfway through to crisp up the bacon a little more.  Served with the Dipping Sauce on this site, delish!

These are so delicious! Mine turned out tasting a bit odd, but it may have been something I did to make it not turn out as good. Still delicious though!

There are no words to express how quickly these were eaten. And I made about 100 of them for a party.

Easiest recipe ever, and a crowd pleaser!!!!!  I put the brown sugar in a large Ziploc bag and shook the bacon-wrapped sausages.  The more brown sugar, the better!  I turned halfway through cooking, and it helps both sides brown and caramelize nicely.

Love, love, LOVE these!! They are VERY greasy though. I suggest moving them to another pan near the end to finish cooking out of the grease pile they create. Not saying they taste bad though, by any means, lol.

Honestly, these were not that good. I was really sad because I expected them to be delicious from all the rave reviews, but I was really disappointed. I took them to a get together...made them in the over-kept them warm in a crock pot...people ate them...but no one seemed to love them or anything. I even marinated them over night. I will never make these again-too much work for something that was just eh. ALSO..it is messy but it's not SOOOO bad that it should deter you from trying it if you want. I didn't even use foil and I was able to get my pants clean afterwards with hot water and regular detergent.

I have made these numerous times and they are the best.  I was visiting my sister in Colorado and made them for a party she was hosting.  They turned out rock hard and I threw them away.  Can anyone please tell me what to do differently for high altitude??

Pretty good, although the cooking time required to get the bacon brown and crispy was significantly more than the recipe suggested. Next time I'll add some spice to liven them up a bit, as they were a touch bland.

Not that this recipe needs more great reviews but I have to say this is really a GREAT recipe.  I made them for the first time for a memorial with more than 100 people and they were gone before I could blink an eye.  Even the children at the memorial LOVED these.  I will serve these at all my gatherings in the future!  Thanks again.

These were delicious! They were gone in minutes of serving.  I used my Nu Wave oven and no mess or smoke and easily done in 10 minutes.  The fat drips off the racks into the bottom pan.  I scewered them on wooden scewers and made sure to leave about a half inch between them so all sides were cooked without turning.  This was so easy clean and delicious! For great appetizers every cook needs an appliance like this.

Takes a few minutes to individually roll each 'dog' into some bacon..but WOW...used an single toothpick per smokie and this was a huge success.  I left them in the oven a bit till the crisped up and they were fantastic..super easy!

OMG, I have to comment on this! I made them yesterday for the Super bowl, a double batch, and they were gone within 10 minutes. They were amazing! After reading some other comments and changes, I made a few changes of my own. I rolled each smokie with bacon and put them in a sealed baggie with a couple cups of brown sugar. I let them sit for a few hours. I then put them in a baking pan on 350 for half an hour. I then drained the fat and sprinkled on another layer of brown sugar. I cooked for 15 min longer, then drained the fat again. Then I broiled them for about 7 minutes. Turned out perfect! Just about enough grease and sugar!

Huge Hit! This is the type of recipe where the saying "you can't just eat one" definately applies! Especially popular with the guys on Football nights, and also big at any party! Use the actual Cocktail Weiners  NOT mini hot dogs. And get a good bacon for the best results!!

Marinated the smokies in brown sugar overnight, then added more before cooking. I wish I put down tin foil because my pan is trash. Tasted good though. They were a hit.

I made these for Christmas brunch and they were gone before anything else. Next time I will double (or triple) the recipe. I had several people ask for it. Thanks for the recipe!

How can this be so easy and yet be such a hit?  I have made this twice, and both times, everyone went nuts over them!  The salesmen at my car lot are usually picky, but they couldn't get enough of them.  Thanks, Tina

These were great!  I took the suggestions of TMARS81 and marinated them overnight, sprinking each layer in the bowl with brown sugar.  One additional thing I did was to coat each piece with the juice that had accumulated in the bowl before I baked them (did use convection at 375).  I fixed them for a church function but was afraid we were going to eat them all before I got to church!!!  Also apreciated the note by a reviewer to line the pans with aluminum foil.  EASY cleanup.

I made these for the first time on Thanksgiving (2010) and my family LOVED them. I am glad I doubled the recipe because the were gone within 20 minutes! I plan on making these for my company Christmas party as well. On one note, they do get EXTREMELY greasy, but then again, i used cheap bacon, which could be the problem. These smokies taste so yummy though!!! :-)

Easy to assemble. No need for toothpicks for me. You might disagree with me ,but we didn't like the brown sugar to it that's why I gave it a 4.

These are really great! My husband insisted that I add more brown sugar - and that made them really good. The sweet / salty combination was very satisfying. To get the bacon crisp I cooked the sausages approximately 45 minutes. I will definitely be making them again.

I have been making these for years.  Everyt time I make them, everybody loves them and asks for the recipe.  Only difference in my recipe is I pour a little pineapple juice over the smokies after the brown sugar is sprinkled on.  I use the juice from a can of pineapples or the little indvidutal Dole pineapple juice drink cans so you don't waste a large can if you are not a pineapple juice drinker.

I made these for a family get-together and my Dad thought they looked rather gross and was hesitant to try them. After one bite he was hooked, couldn't stop eating them! These always disappear quickly and are one of our favorite guilty pleasures.

I've been making this appetizer for years and they are always a hit! For an easy twist on the recipe, blend 1/2 tsp. of ground cayenne pepper to the brown sugar and mix well before coating the bacon and little smokies. It's not enough to make them hot, but just enough to add a little punch!

Love, love, love these! Just served at my husband's 40th bday party. They were yummy, so yummy, i made more the day after the party with the unused smokies. They went so fast, I ran out early in the party. I did not skewer the smokies, just placed on the cookie sheet. Will definitely be in my arsenal.

Made these for a party, and they were gone in 10 minutes!  I used toothpicks on each individually and left them on when served.  That way people could easily grab them.  It's not much clean up if you line your sheet with aluminum foil.  Definitely will make this recipe again :)

YUM!  These are delish.  The guys especially liked these.  Using the broiler pan in the oven makes the cooking easier and much cleaner for the bacon fat and grease.  I also thought the oven temperature needed to be a bit hotter to get the meat crispy, around 375 degrees.

A really big hit at a recent family gathering.  I did follow a recommendation of drizzling some molasses over them and then topping with brown sugar.  May not be healthy, but we have to splurge once in awhile!

I made these for a Christmas party for my husbands friend. One friend always makes these and everyone loves them. Well mine went faster than his did and people kept coming up to me saying mine were better. It is a good idea to coat the bacon in brown sugar. Be careful about leaving them in the slowcooker to keep warm because by the end of the night the few I had left had carmalized.

Yum! I added way more brown sugar, and made the dipping sauce someone suggested (mayo, chili sauce, brown sugar).  I made about 3 times as much for a party, and they disappeared before some of the other dishes were even touched!

These are good and was the first thing that dissappeared on NewYears Eve. I suggest that you use a quality bacon that has lots of meat rather than fat. I turned the skewers 3 or 4 times and kept my eye on them while cooking. Some browned sooner than others. I didnt measure the brown sugar, I just sprinkled some on top and called it done. It was appealling to all....

I made these 4 separate occasions just in the last 2 months. Easiest appetizer for all those holiday parties. Always have to double the recipe. Thank goodness the little smokies are on sale all during the holidays. My boss loves them the best he calls them "little heart attacks on a stick"

Great flavor.  My only issue was how long it took for the bacon to crisp.  I ended up broiling to finish at the end. Everyone loved these and it was a group with different preferences.

Common sense should tell you these are not 5 star. Even the sauce as suggested by others does not help. Wife said .."Eh, not someting I would want often." I agree.

Big hit from everyone... I call them ' lil' heart attacks' !  I put all ingredients in a bowl, put the cover on and shake.  For easy oven clean up, I use a broil pan, line the bottom with foil and spray the top with nonstick spray. The grease drips to the bottom while cooking and when cool just lift out the foil.  I have also cooked in a pan on the stove, but just have to watch close so they don't get to hot and burn. You have to be quick to turn over because there are so many. But I think the oven is the best way to make... Very very good.

You can't get any easier than this and the price to make this appetizer is so inexpenive! It only cost me $5.00. I also sprinkled brown sugar over the bacon wrapped smokies and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I did not put toothpicks through them and the bacon adhered just fine.  I lined a baking sheet with foil for easy clean up.  I couldn't stop gobbling these down.  Also as a side note, I had these on a serving dish and they kept very nicely without having to stay heated.  Great to bring along for a picnic, etc.  Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loved these at our family gathering. Even though I accidentally burned them. I baked as directed for 20 minutes and the bacon wasn't crisp yet, so I put them under the broiler. The bacon crisped up nicely, but the brown sugar burned. So for me, bake as long as necessary and WATCH them! Delicious in spite of it, and I served them with Jack Daniel's bbq sauce for dipping. Great recipe!

I made these first in November and would have given that batch 5 stars, but the second time I made them, they didn't turn out as well.  Great idea, great flavor and loved as a treat by guests waiting on Thanksgiving dinner.  I'd try them again perhaps the second time it was a fatter brand of bacon or just me.

OMG my husband and children LOVE these!!! As well as anyone else who has tried them. I am making a triple batch for a BBQ this weekend and am excited to test them out on a group of people who have never heard of them!! *update* They were a hit!! Everyone LOVED them...wanted the recipe. You could definitely get by with cutting the bacon in fourths rather than thirds. I learned that too late and had to send hubby on a bacon run. :-)

Definitely the talk of the party! I made these the morning of my daughter's graduation party and they were gone within a few minutes after I put them out. Every single person asked for more! I took some advice from other reviewers and they came out perfect! I cut the bacon in 1/3's and wrapped each smokie and put a toothpick in the seam. I placed them on a baking sheet and then sprinkled brown sugar generously over all of them. I baked them for about 15 minutes and they didn't appear to be cooking fast enough, so I broiled them about 15 minutes and they came out perfect! I will definitely be making these at all my parties!! Thank you! Heather in Florida

Great flavor.  I did take another suggestion by using center cut bacon but it was still greasy but had great flavor.  I also dipped the bacon in the brown sugar prior to wrapping.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and easy. I also agree with others to sprinkle the brown sugar on top and let it soak in the juices through the night. They are a hit and gone in seconds!

5 stars after an adjustment. I lay the bacon flat out on parchment paper and put brown sugar on both sides of bacon, then I roll smokies up with the bacon.

Very yummy and messy!! I wish I would have used more brown sugar... dipped both smokie and bacon in sugar... I also used toothpicks but ended up taking them out so the skewers would have been better. I baked them but ended up broiling and flipping to get each side crispy.

Addictive! I used other reviewers advice and precooked the bacon a little in the skillet, then rub the bacon in some brown sugar. Then wrap the smokie. I also sprinkled what ever brown sugar that was left over, over the prepared smokies before baking.

I have made these for 2 years now and they are great.  To make them the best you need to cook them on the grill or smoker outside, the wood smoke makes a difference.

These were okay. I made on a broiler pan on wooden skewers with about 5 smokies a piece.  To get the bacon anywhere near crispy, these have to be turned. I cooked them for about 30 minutes, turned them and broiled on low for about 15 minutes. I was trying to get the bacon done. Bottom line - they had a decent taste but no real bacon flavor and the bacon was not really crispy in the usual sense. They were easy to put together - I'm taking a star off for flavor and one off for the extremely extended cooking time.

These are so easy and are simply delicious.  I make tons of these for every party and they always go fast!  My kids, ages 12 and 14, and all of their friends, love them (and like making them too!). I don't measure the brown sugar - I just sprinkle it very liberally over the top.

I have been making these for quite some time.  I use turkey bacon.  I also cover them in syrup, any kind of pancake syrup will do and then top them all off with brown sugar.  These are always the first to go at any party.

I love, love this recipe. It is a favorite in my family. I use it during holiday's and parties. I do put the smokies in a crock pot w/ 1/2 cup of maple syrup on low when done to keep fresh as advised in other reviews.

These were awesome!  Yes, messy, but oh so good. Make alot more than you think you need. They will go before any other food in your buffet goes. I used my broiler pan so the fat could drip. I sprayed it with cooking spray first.

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and my bacon was rubbery and disgusting.  It never got crispy and made the appetizer really fatty and chewy.  They sounded so good, so I tried again with a different brand of bacon...same results, rubbery bacon. I even cooked the second batch longer, and the edges of the weinies started to burn.  Again, it sounded delish, but I  like crisp bacon!

We loved these. I dredged the bacon and the smokies in brown sugar before rolling them up. I skewered them and placed the skewers across a foil lined baking sheet, then sprinkled with more brown sugar. You really should make about 2 times the amount that you think you need as someone else suggested.

Yummo!  Just line the pan with tinfoil for easy clean-up.  I def recommend using the broiler.  After 30 minutes at 350 and 5 on broil they still weren't crunchy.

Very good, Like candy:) I put them on a cooling rack in the oven and placed it on a lined cookie sheet. I sprinkled brown sugar on them every 15mins and turned them over once at the 30min mark. Cooked perfectly and everyone loved them, 1st to go!

Great recipe, I cheated and used Oscar Meyer already cooked bacon and wrapped them with 1/2 a strip of bacon. Everyone loved them and it saved me alot of time and a greasey mess.

A real crowd pleaser!  I made about 100 for a progressive dinner, they were gone within 30 minutes.  I followed the advice of previous reviews:  1.Ran the smokies and bacon pieces through brown sugar before assembling, 2. Used Reynolds Release foil 3. Baked for 50 minutes at 350 (partly because I used thick sliced bacon). Thanks for the recipe!

When I first read this recipe, I thought that it sounded rather terrible.  However, I gave it a shot since it got such great reviews.  I am very happy that I tried it because my husband and his friends LOVE it.  After making it a couple of times and reading other reviews, I found that I like this recipe best when I brown the bacon a little before wrapping it.  Also, when I used regular cut bacon rather than the thick cut, it seemed to crisp better.  However, I used 1/2 slice of the regular bacon instead of 1/3 slice of the thick.

I also put these on skewers and placed them over a cake pan (lined in tin foil) to make clean-up easier.  Before I removed them from the skewers, I stuck a toothpick into each so that the bacon doesn't slip off.

I have been told that I will be making these for SuperBowl!

These are so good.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion and prepped them the night before.  I wrapped them and put them in a ziploc with 6 Tbsp of brown sugar.  When I baked them the next day I did not add anymore sugar and they were perfect.  Sweet but not overly sweet, so good I will definately make again.

I don't like it.  I think that smokies are too salty.  However, if your making something for Fight Night or a football party, this is the way to go.  Guys go nuts over these smokies.  They're always asking me to make it.

Wow!!  Made these for christmas eve and they were a HUGE hit!  I made the mistake of buying the little franks and not the smokies, but it didnt seem to matter!  I didnt bother with the tooth picks, which made them so easy to throw together.  You cant go wrong with these!

These were really good!!! I took them to work and they were gone in about an hour or so! I made two batches but I ended up only using 1 cup of brown sugar. I think they would have been a little too sweet with as much as the recipe calls for. Really good and easy to make I would definately do this again!!

First time I made this recipe, my friends looked at it with a raised brow. They jokingly called it "Pork on Pork", and the most adventurous took a small bite after it came out of the oven. Less than 5 minutes later the entire batch was gone. To this day I am not allowed to show up at a party without this. Fantastic!

I ended up putting these on a broiler pan so they were not greasy.  I found that most of the brown sugar dropped in the pan and did not stay on the smokies. Next time I will just deal with the grease and let them soak in the brown sugar.  It was still good recipe just needed a bit more to it!

Plus I sprinkled with brown sugar and put
in the refrigerator for a few hours.

I'm not sure if this is where I got the actual recipe but it is delicious!  I used toothpicks to secure the bacon and made it easier to eat. I turned the smokies half way thru and put more brown sugar on them.  Afterwards I put the smokies in the crockpot and poured some of the grease/sugar mix in there with them.  I took these to a cookout/tailgaiting party and the crockpot was empty before we left!

I served these on Halloween with some other snacks.  They were a little messy to assemble but did taste good.  I did as others suggested and dipped both sides of the bacon in the brown sugar.  Also put them on skewers for easy turning.  I think I may try pre-cookiung the bacon next time because by the time the bacon was done (about 40 min. or so) the smokies were getting a little burnt.  No one complained but, even so, I think it would make things easier for me.  :)

I'm not going to make you read the same thing twice, so look at "txmommy22" review posted on 09/18/08.  I totally agree with everything she said.  That's what makes this recipe a 5.  Thanks for posting.

I made these lastnight for a football party we were having at the house.  This is the perfect snack for any get together... I ended up making not one but 3 (16 ounce) packages of smokies and used about 2 1/2 packs of bacon!!  We had around 14 people show up and before the end of the football game there was not even one left!  I absolutly love this EASY recipe and will make it again and again!!!

I made these using hot dogs that I cut into fourths.  I also added extra brown sugar while they were baking.  These are a BIG hit with our group!

Served these at my husband's birthday party.  Everyone loved them.  Not a single one left and that was well before dinner even started!  To save on time, I put 2-3 on a skewer at a time.

these were AMAZING. i didn't do the whole recipe b/c there were just a few of us eating, so i think i only did half of the package of little smokies. i didn't measure the brown sugar at all, just made sure that everything in the pan was covered and it was  so wonderful! people at my dinner party thought i was a genius. definitely needed to be taken out of the pan (i didn't have a roasting pan) and put on a paper towel for a few minutes before being put on the serving dish to let some of the extra grease and syrup drip off. will DEFINITELY make these again.

I've never made an appetizer that generated such "food lust". One taste, and people want more. Instead of serving with the brown sugar/bacon grease slurry, drain them, add to the crock pot, pour in 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup, and stir. The flavor enhancement is incredible. Also, these get even better as they're warmed in the slow cooker.

This is a great crowd pleaser! I did tightly pack the hotdogs in a dish, covered them in the sugar mixture and left in the fridge overnight. Excellent!

This was the biggest hit at my son's birthday party (among the adults).  I figured only the kids might like them, but they were being gobbled up by the adults and they thought it was something they would have never thought of.  At first I thought this recipe didn't sound good to me at all, but reading the reviews made me want to make it (figuring the kids would like them).  I used regular beef weiners and had packed on the brown sugar onto each wrapped weiner 2 nights in advance and stored them in a ziplock (they did not unwrap).  I then baked them on a slotted baking sheet (not even bothering with the skewers).  If you do not have a sweet-tooth, you may not like these as much as others, but I thought they were delicious and I'm not one to pick at little hot dogs at parties.  It's a nice change from your usual pigs in a blanket.  Make sure to double the recipe (like I did) because they DO go ! (I had 30 adults at the party and I kept toothpicks on the side of this appetizer).  Thanks !!!

Amazing. People are always in a puddle on the floor when I make these. I followed some others advice and soaked the smokies (wrapped in the bacon) in brown sugar over night.

This is wonderful it was the first appetizer that was gone.  I used the suggestion of slated broiling pan, this cut down the grease issue.  Next time I'm going to marinate them in the morning as suggested.

I have had these at parties.  I love them, I made them tonight at home and I must say.. they are better after sitting in crockpot at the party.  I think its because the sugar melds in rather than just taking them out of the oven and eating.  LEFTOVER IDEA.. cut up and put in pork n beans..

Not too crazy about them. The brown sugar was a good idea for something different on the little smokies but the bacon was weird.

I used splenda blends for a diabetic friends baby shower, and wow they were great. I was worried that the sugar would burn since it was not normal brown sugar, but it was great. Just sprinkled it on top of them. I can't wait to make them with regular brown sugar.

I just won first place in an appetizer contest in my apartment complex with this recipe! Everyone loved it. I coated the bacon with brown sugar before rolling, and broiled the smokies about 10 minutes on each side. I made the sauce that was suggested by someone else, but it didn't seem too popular. Also, I didn't have any toothpicks or skewers, but all the brown sugar made it stick together pretty well on its own. Will definitely make again!

These are out of this world! Easy, yet a little time consuming but worth every minute. I baked them on non-stick foil for easy clean-up. My son thinks they're "the most delicious things to ever grace the earth". Okay, that's quite an overstatement but don't hesitate to try them.

Absolutey delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a bit of a mess with the grease that came from the bacon, I just drained the pan twice during baking and it worked out great!  I also put 3 smokies per toothpick and that worked out well also.  Made a double batch and they were gobbled up in no time at all!

I'd give more stars if I could.  I made them for the Packers/Giants game and although that was a huge disappointment to us, these little smokies kept everyone smiling.  I baked them for about 40 minutes and they turned out perfect.

If you are contemplating trying these, I have four words for you.. you MUST try them!! They are unbelievable!! These will be the first appetizers to go at any get together you have. A few of my guests were a bit hesitant of these while i was making them, they saw the raw bacon and weenies and sugar, but once they came out of the oven, they were gone within twenty minutes if even that long and we only had about 6 people there!! My husband told me these were to be added to the "must have to eat list" at our next party. I would definately give this more than 5 stars if I could, and will most definately make them again and again!!

A lot of people seem to have a problem with reheating them-- don't!  they're fantastic at room temperature and my sister had the brilliant idea to skewer a cube of jalapeno cheese to the tops of them after they'd cooled-- DELICIOUS!

Pretty good!  Admittedly not the healthiest thing in the world, but very tasty.  I did as others suggested and baked in oven followed by keeping warm in crock pot, found that they somewhat "dried up" en route to the christmas party, by the time they arrived, they did not look very appetizing (kind of dark brown and shriveled) and were not as yummy as when I had first had them out of the oven earlier in the morning.  Surprisingly still had lots of leftovers at the party! Next party I made them at they were served almost immediately and gobbled up within 20 minutes.  The accompanying sauce is a must.  I didn't have any chili sauce, so I just did mayo, brown sugar and bbq sauce..absolute heaven!

Oh my... these are delicious!  The first time I made these I followed someone else's suggestion to coat the bacon in the brown sugar and then wrap, I used toothpicks and stuck them through a wire rack.  I noticed they were not browning (at all) on the bottom so I picked up each one and stuck the other end through the rack to brown the opposite side.  After all that I still had missed some but they were soo yummy.  The second time around I used long skewers and I just balanced them on the edges of the pan I was using, when it was time to brown the other side I just flipped the skewer.  So much easier!  One thing you have to be careful about is allowing a little room between them on the skewer, otherwise the bacon will remain rather pale and ick on the sides of the smokies.  Reheating these did not make for a very good dish because the sugar turned soggy. Serve them fresh and hot, the sugar makes a little bit of a crispy coating.  Overall this was totally fabulous, and I will make many many more times!

My family loved these.  I used a disposable pan for easy clean up.  When they were done baking, we poked a hole in side of the pan to drain it.

These were great!!  My husband wasn't sure if he wanted any at first, but then he ate more than I did!  I put the bacon in the brown suger first, doing both sides.  It's really easy to make and even better to eat!  Thanks for sharing!

I catered a party, and made the brown sugar smokies.  I was hesitant at first on making these, but by the end of the night they were gone!  not as gourmet as i normally cook, but they were a hit.

I've been making these for a couple years now.   They are the best!!  They totally mess up your pan and smoke up your kitchen (I do them in a pan on the grill sometimes to avoid this) but as another reviewer stated, they are worth every bit of it.

Make tons, they disappear too fast! I used skewers and left appx.  1 1/2 inches of space between each smokie. I baked them for 45 minutes, broiling them for the last 2 minutes to make the bacon very crispy.

When I show up to a party without my "pork on pork," I always get groans of disappointment. Salty plus sweet from the brown sugar; yum. I find that I need to cook for 45-60 min to get everything really brown and caramelized (worth the wait for the full caramelization flavor). I've thought about soaking the toothpicks in water to help them not get charred during cooking, but I always forget, and nobody ever seems to mind a bit of burnt pick on their fingertips.

I'm not sure that the work was worth the outcome.  I did use turkey bacon since others were having trouble with the bacon crisping up.  I cut each slice into thirds and rolled in the brown sugar.  Good, but not great.

Ok, I'm redoing my review! I used regular cut bacon rather than thick cut, and that really cut down on the grease. I baked them a little longer, and while they did not get super crispy, they did crisp up more with the thinner cut of bacon. We prefer to eat these after they have sat for a few minutes, because we think they taste better after they have been out of the oven for awhile. And I using a broiler pan really makes for easy cleanup! Thanks for a great recipe!

Was a bit messy to make but SO good. I took some advice from earlier posters and dipped them in brown sugar rather than sprinkling it on them. The more sugar...the better! Also, put foil on the cookie sheet...and I skipped the skewers and just used toothpicks.

I can only use one word to describe this - Gone! They go sooooo fast! The bacon crisps perfectly, the sugar carmalizes on the smokies, and the smokies cook through. These are a must-do for any get-together requiring an appetiser.

These were good.  My husband thought they were too sweet.  They were gobbled up - but I don't think I'll make them again.  We like bacon wrapped shrimp with bbq sauce better.

These are really delish.  Made them for a trivia night and they were gone in less than half an hour!  They were also requested again for the next weekend by everyone at the table.  This recipe made it into my "favorites" section right away.

My family thought these were "just OK".  My daughter said she could not taste the bacon.  We decided they might be better without the sugar, and I didn't even use as much as it called for. They did taste better dipped in spicy brown mustard.

They tastes great, but you can't eat too many of them because of too many calories.

A mainstay of mine these are marvelously simple and off the charts good with tangy or spicy mustard to balance the sweet. Use good quality bacon as it is such a major player in the flavor. Can't imagine Super Bowl without these puppies.

Huge hit! They're going to become a party staple at my house! Make sure to use a very thin cut of bacon otherwise they'll take more time to cook than stated in the recipe.

These are so unhealthy, and a bit greasy, but they are also something highly favored by the guys here. These are great for game day snackies. So simple to make in the oven!

I tripled this recipe for a party of thirty-five and there were none left. The guys really enjoyed the "meat wrapped in meat"! I'm not a meat lover and even I had to admit, they're pretty darn good! They were a very big hit and easy to make. (Note: I had to cook them for about 30 minutes instead of the noted 20 minutes and I put a little mound of brown sugar on each for a little extra sweetness.)

Another way to prepare is in a crockpot; you don't have worry about the brown sugar burning.

A huge hit on Super Bowl Sunday.  Very easy to make and they were gobbled up.  Made a few hours ahead and kept them warm in a crock pot.

I've made this twice now for holiday parties and just finished a batch for tomorrow's New Year's Eve party. Each time, I partnered up with a girlfriend, and we made them methodically; one of us dredged the smokies in brown sugar, the other dredged the bacon and wrapped them. We were making for a crowd, with a 3 lb. Costco-size package of smokies and 3 lbs of bacon. By cutting the bacon slices in 3rds, we used almost all of the ingeredients, for a total of 150 smokies.  We baked them at 350 for almost an hour, and drained the grease and brown sugar into a container for tomorrow. We'll have them ready in no time by putting them in a crock pot and pouring the remaining glaze over top.  They were awesome tonight, and I can't wait for them to disappear tomorrow! YUM!

I bought the wrong weiners, I used the cocktail weiners instead of the lil smokies but they were still so good. I put the brown sugar in a bag and put the weiners in with them to coat them and sprinkled the extra sugar in the bag on the bacon before rolling them up. I baked them at 375 for 25 minutes then transferred to a crock pot to finish cooking. I found if the bacon wasn't real cold you could stretch it around the weiners easier and didn't need a scewer, I also lined my pan and sprayed it with some crisco spray.

These tasted good but looked awful, hardly anyone even tried them.  If I ever make them again, I will use the idea suggested by ealier reviewers and make them on a broiler pan.

Delicious! Dredging the bacon in brown sugar FIRST and then wrapping the sausages makes this appetizer faster and ensures sugar is spread throughout.

An absolute every time I make them! The thing I have found that makes it much easier to make is to use the precooked bacon. It cuts the cooking time in half and has just the right amount of grease to mix with the sugar.

I made these for a party and they were an absolute hit with everyone- kids to adults!  I needed to make a bunch so I did 4- 9 x 13 pans with several on a skewer.  When they had cooled a bit I took them off of the skewers and put them in one of the pans with the brown sugar "syrup" and served them with a spoon.  Everyone wants this recipe!  : )

These were gone in 10 minutes. I cooked them one to a toothpick and put them on a rack. I baked them for about 45 minutes to get the bacon really crisp. DEFINITELY going into the permanent file!

I made these for a party we were having and they were the first thing to go. I thought I was making more than enough, but I could have made twice as many. Everyone loved them and they were very easy. The only thing I am going to do different next time is put them in a tray with a rack so they aren't sitting in the grease while they cook.

I'll just chime in here with the same raves.  Served this at a poker party the other night and they lasted only minutes.  I didn't have any skewers - just laid the little smokies on a baking sheet and it worked out fine.  Will definitely make again.

Hot doggie, these are good!  I made these for a Superbowl party, and they were the only item totally consumed.  The blend of flavors is divine.  This recipe is a giant must for future parties, or even a "pick me up" when cabin fever sets in!

I have eaten these before, but this was the first time making them. I made them for new year's eve and just a few days ago as well and they were completely gone both times. The only reason for the 4*** is because it took me longer than 30 minutes to cook them, probably closer to 45. Next time I will try 375-400 and cook for less time. I used a glass pyrex 9x13" pan and can fit about 36-40 smokies in there. Even after letting the pan sit out overnight without soaking, I just stuck it in the dishwasher and it cleaned up perfectly. Super simple and tasty too!!

Awesome!  Made them twice over the holidays and got rave reviews from everyone.  I did cook them a little longer than indicated to make sure the bacon got crisp.

Wow  these were super! They took about 40 minutes to bake enough so that the bacon was crispy. I'll be making these again!

These were good but if I make them again I will just dredge the bacon in brown sugar and not add more brown sugar on top, as it burned and smoked up my kitchen before the bacon was done.  I suggest, cook 15 minutes, turn and cook 15 additional minutes to evenly cook the bacon.

These were awesome!  I followed the recipe, but I baked them longer -- about an hour -- as I like my bacon crisp.  All of the previous suggestions were right -- use as much brown sugar as you can.  I used a jelly roll pan and lined it with foil to make clean-up easier.  They were so wonderful!  Even my picky 7-year old just loved them!  I will definitely make these again and again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Everybody loved these!  These are hard to stop eating.  Be sure to use as much brown sugar as you possibly can.  The combination of fat and sugar is irresistible!

okay i must admit that I did not care for these...too sweet for me, however EVERYONE @ my pitch-in LOVED them.  I made them about 9 months ago for a school pitch-in, it is time again to have another one and everyone asked if i would PLEASE make these. They raved all night long about how I would be bringing them.  WOW!  I also took another readers advice and let my bacon soak for about 2-3 hrs before wrapping it around the smokies, messy but worth it!  I also lined my pan, if not it will be too hard to clean up.  I bake for about 25-30 mintues then broiled them, i also keep adding or basting with brown sugar as they cooked!  This is a keeper!

I have been making these for 15 years now and they are asked for at every party!  I truly recommend keeping them hot thru the night.  And I always make them the day before but never put the sugar on until right before cooking.

Delicious!
Brought them to the "new" in-laws Thanksgiving.
As you all know it's SOOO important to make a great food impression.
Needless to say, they were a hit and these smokies are going to be a holiday get together regular!  Thank you Tina!

These were so good. I fixed them for tailgating at
the ballgame and everyone wanted the recipe. I wrapped them the night before and I'm glad I did.
It took a lot of time, but was well worth it. I 
can't wait to fix these again.

Good, but not amazingly good.  I wasn't sure it was worth all the effort.  I cooked the bacon halfway in the microwave, after hearing other's comments of the long time it took to cook the bacon in the oven.  I like them better in a slow cooker with jelly and maple syrup...much easier!!!!

***** Now I know why everyone rated this recipe with 5 stars!  This is absolutely delicious, and could not be easier to make.  You might want to double the recipe - - they go fast.  I broiled mine at the end, too, to make crispy.  And use more brown sugar than the original recipe calls for.  I was told this recipe is even better than my water chestnuts wrapped in bacon and BBQ sauce recipe, and that has been a family favorite for years!  YUM!

(I don't know what 'smokies' are, but I used a kind of 'salami' sausage)
This adds really flavor to a 'normal' sausage. I put them on a skewer, and pricked them in a orange-half. Because I had sausages left, I just sprinkled them with the brown sugar and baked them with the others. It works great, too!

OH MY GOSH!  These were great!  Rather time consuming, but well worth it.  I made them for home and took some to work as well.  They disappeared in minutes!  They are good cold, but better warmed up.  What a good combination of ingredients!

These were a huge hit and so incredibly easy.  I cooked them at a higher temperature to get them crispier.  I also loaded the brown sugar on.  Very good.

I have made these three times, just since Christmas! Everyone absolutely loves them! They are the first things to go. I added a little more brown sugar to mine, I like things a little sweeter. They are perfect. Just don't use the thick bacon It'll take longer to cook.

Made these for the Super Bowl and they were gone immediately even though I should have cooked them longer since I used thick sliced bacon and it wasn't quite done. The guys didn't even notice! Next time I'll use more brown sugar because there definetely wasn't enough. Took a little while to wrap them all but it was worth it. Great recipe!

This was a big hit at our family gathering.  Got lots of compliments.  I would suggest doubling the recipe since they go so fast :)

Sweet and savory! It just won't taste the same if you don't add the brown sugar to sweeten all of the saltiness of the meats. This dish also keeps warm through the day. I made them as an appetizer for Thanksgiving, and they didn't get soggy or overcooked while sitting in my crockpot all day!

I made these for a NYE party and they were a big hit. I did change up the recipe some: 1. I brushed some jam on the bacon-wrapped smokies before adding the brown sugar and 2. I tossed the smokies in a bowl with the brown sugar then 3. I cooked them in the slow cooker until the bacon looked done. Theses appetizers were the first to go.

I have made these several times now, but the last one was the best.  I used maple bacon instead of regular. I put the brown sugar on a plate and added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and blended together. I then took the skewers and pressed them into the brown sugar mixture rubbing the mixture all over the franks. I then baked as suggested. The sweet heat was delish!

Turned out great. Cooked it on cast iron griddle (allowed grease to drain off) in Traeger grill. Had to cook a bit longer to get bacon crispy. Tip:roll thick bacon with rolling pin-wraps better. Used pecan wood pellets. Yummy! Plan to make this on NYE

I have been making these for years. Here is a tip to save time. Wrap each with the bacon place edge down in cookie sheet. Cover the entire thing with a layer of brown sugar, bake then eat. You won't have a toothpick or wood skire to slow you down.

I made these once before as an appetizer for dinner. They were a hit. Today I made them again, but since I am on keto, I used Truvia, which is a blend of stevia and molasses and something else with much less sugar than brown sugar. 2 carbs .5 tsp and I used about .25 tsp a weiner. They also have the brown sugar substitute Swerve I have heard is really good and would like to try again. A good app or I even paired it with my eggs for breakfast :-).

My son-in-law made these several years ago. Now many of the cooks in the family have made these. Someone tried using hot dogs with cheese in them, cut them in 3 sections, wrap with bacon also cut in 3 and cook in crock pot with brown sugar until browned. They are very popular, and go very fast.

The reviews were correct, I took this to two parties and in both cases none were left over.  A few notes: both center cut bacon and smokies are sold here in 12 oz. packages.  I used center cut bacon as suggested by the video.  It was shorter than regular bacon so I had to cut in half to have enough length to wrap the smokies.  Baking at 350F for 40 minutes did not cook the bacon enough (not crispy at all even after turning 3 times).  So I moved them to a cooling rack over a lined cookie sheet and put under the boiler (turning once) to get a nice cooked crispy bacon.  Next time I might dredge them in brown sugar, rather than sprinkling it on.

Ok these were really good but super tedious and messy to make. I coated the bacon in brown sugar as well as the smokies before I rolled them up. Placed about 6-7 per skewer. And let them sit for several hrs in the fridge. Then I re-coated each side with brown sugar again before placing them in the oven. I didn’t have any kind of drip pan or cooling rack, which would’ve been ideal. I had to switch pans halfway through because of all the grease. I baked each side for 7 min at 350° and then broiled each side for about 1-2 min afterwards, but you do have to watch them or they will burn! Then placed in crockpot to keep them warm for the potluck at work.  Really good, but I felt like they still could’ve used more brown sugar, so don’t be afraid to really lay it on there thick! Next time I won’t hold back!

How can you go wrong with these? You can't. They are delicious. If you need to take something to a potluck make these. I usually take water chestnuts and wrap those in half a piece of bacon, secure with toothpicks and baste with teriyaki sauce during the cooking process. Those are usually a huge hit at any potluck, but these brown sugar smokies are YUMMY!

I do make these pretty much the same way, except I put cayenne pepper in with sugar. Put it in a gallon zip lock bag and toss them around. Oh yeah I also just use tooth picks instead of skewers. Just easier finger food plus make it a lot easier to season them verses just sprinkling it on there.

made these for Thanksgiving and my family raved - requested it for Christmas dinner as well.  I took other reviews advice and assembled the night before so the brown sugar would melt into the bacon and make a yummy syrup - then just had to pop in the oven when family arrived.  Some of them even overcooked and they loved them the best since they were chewier.  I like this recipe's instructions to bake instead of broil, I think they cook more evenly and they don't need to be watched.

I’m a beginner cook and EVEN I hit it out of the park making these! I followed the tips and marinated the bacon wrapped Smokies overnight with the brown sugar. Then, I placed them on a broiler pan with foil lined on the bottom and they cooked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. (I turned them over midway.) I made these for a girlfriend potluck and the whole batch was consumed by 4 NJ girls, which means 5 stars!

I did not use center cur bacon, but would try that next time.  Had to cut my strips in 1/4 in order to avoid bacon wrap overlap.  I followed another's advice and shook the smokies and bacon pieces in brown sugar, then wrapped and microwaved on paper towels for a few minutes to partially cook the bacon, then I sprinkled more brown sugar on the smokies laid on a foil lined cookie sheet and broiled until done.  Still greasy and messy and had to turn them over then and broil some more.  They were good, but lots of work and mess, so these would be a rare appetizer for me to make.

I was very pleased with this  appetizer and will definitely make again.  I ALWAYS read the reviews before trying a recipe for the first time. Followed the recipe but used the  following "prepping" variation from one of the reviews. There were several methods for "prepping" this dish -  the following  worked very well for me.  Marinade the lil smokies and bacon in separate plastic bags with brown sugar for 30 minutes (next time closer to 45 minutes).  The brown sugar becomes a wonderful syrupy consistency flavoring the bacon and lil smokes.  Layer assembled bacon/lil smokies in a bowl with brown sugar between layers.  Refrigerate covered overnight.  I thought this was a great way for the brown sugar flavor to really permeate the meats.  Baked at 350 degrees F  for  30 minutes.  Turned over the smokies and broiled for 5 minutes (I used thick cut bacon which required extra time broiling).  Didn't have to broil on the other side as the bacon was crisp from the baking.  Next time I will try another reviewer's suggestion of baking at 425 for 20-25 minutes for crispy bacon.  Thanks for submitting this delicious recipe.

I have made these many time.  I follow the simple recipe and I don't use too much brown sugar.  The worst part is cutting the bacon into thirds and then wrapping it.  But anything this good is worth a little work and a little mess.

I thought it was too salty, my husband on the other hand liked it.  Didn’t taste the sweetness at all. I rolled the bacon pieces on the sugar, I will try to make these again and I will roll the sausages on the sugar as well.

These are time consuming and a big mess but so totally worth it! Sweet, gooey, meaty deliciousness! I made these for my bunco gals a few years ago and they requested I make them every year! I can't believe I never reviewed them before today.

Here's my take from reading a bunch of review and making these several times.  I cut the bacon in half and wrap around the smokies.  No toothpicks/skewers necessary.  I don't measure the brown sugar. I sprinkle some brown sugar in the bottom of a large, flat rectangle Tupperware container.  Then add a layer of smokies.  Then more brown sugar, then more smokies 24  hours or more in advance. 

On serving day, If I have time, I do pre-cook them in small batches in the microwave on several layers of those cheap white paper plates early in the day. Then  finish baking in the oven. I just check them every 15 minutes or so.  I always use a broiler pan with the bottom pan completely covered in foil.  It helps clean up, but the pan is still a gooey mess. Don't worry if you over bake them, they still taste great! Then, to keep them warm, I put them in the crock pot.  Sometimes I add more brown sugar and/or pancake syrup/molasses if I think they need more "goo." 

You definitely want to consider doubling the recipe!

Brought these to a tailgate and they were a huge hit! I took some other reviewers advise and assembled these the night before and let them “marinate”. I also used a broiler pan so they crisped up instead of sitting in their own juices. Before going into the oven I brushed them with the remaining liquid in the bottom of the marinade container and did a final sprinkle of brown sugar. It’s smokies wrapped in bacon, you really can’t go wrong! These also reheated nicely on the grill at the tailgate. Def making again and again!

These are delightful treats! Unfortunatly they are SOO GREASY! I really like them at first but then i felt like i would be sick. It was overwhelming. Otherwise it would be a 5 star! My guests LOVE them. I found that using thinner bacon will be a better way. Because then the bacon cooks faster.

Very good (you can't go wrong with sugar and meat), but probably only a once-a-year type treat. Also, good to keep an eye on them and rotate to make sure they don't burn.

These were absolutely fantastic, and a huge hit at my party. I marinated them in tons of brown sugar overnight, then spooned the marinade over them to cook. I do not recommend doing that, as the syrupy sugar burned and I kept having to spoon it out and shift the smokies away from the burnt patches so they wouldn't taste of burnt sugar. It also made the sheet pan nearly impossible to clean. Next time I will just marinate them, then cook them as is.

I tried several variations for baking and all turned out great. The key is to put them on a cooling rack over a foil covered cookie sheet so that they dont sit in the burning brown sugar at the bottom of the pan. I tried 20 min at 425, 40 min at 350, 30 min at 350 and 10 min at 400..... all turned out about the same. I like the 350 for 30 min and 400 for 10 min as there is less smoke.

Excellent, popular and super easy.  I put brown sugar in a plate, pr seed bacon into it and rolled up mini sausage (PC Little Smokies) securing with a toothpick.  Baked on wire rack on baking sheet covered in foil.  Served with various mustards.  Made three times over the Christmas holidays.  Hit every time.

My daughter had these at a tailgate party, where they had been cooked (or kept warm?) in a Crock Pot. We made them at home and followed this recipe. 

I found that  the bacon was not cooked enough for our tastes at the recommended cook time. I went at least another 15 minutes because we like our bacon more cooked and wanted the brown sugar to caramelize a bit. 

They were a hit at our party! I served them with both regular yellow mustard and spicy brown mustard for dipping. They were good plain or with either mustard, but I especially liked the spicy brown mustard with them. 

We'll definitely make them again!

Simple and delicious! I made these for a family dinner. Everyone really enjoyed them. I will make them again for sure! My only difference was that I had apple cinnamon bacon, so I skipped the brown sugar. It was a very nice, subtle sweetness. I want to try it again with the brown sugar.

This recipe was OK , but the recipe was on the slow cooker category and the recipe did not have a slow cooker put to use. BLEH!

I had to make these twice, because I burnt the first ones. I didn't have any idea how long to cook them. I tried them for an hour based on one review and the bottoms were black. The second time I baked them for 40 minutes. They were still starting to burn. I would say to check them at 30-35 minutes. I am sure it also depends on your bacon. Next time I might them in the slow cooker. Great flavors. Addicting!

I've made these many, many times and there's never any left, even doubling the recipe. The only thing I change is that I use Maple flavored bacon and it adds to the wonderful flavor. Thanks from many for this wonderful recipe. (Oh, one more thing. I find that I light the light brown sugar better than the dark for this.)

Can't stop eating them!!  Use thin bacon, can do up the night before. Will need toothpicks. Roll in brown sugar is easiest. I put foil on my cookie sheet for easier clean up.  
I fliped/turned them as they backed for more even color.
First thing to go at party. lol
Will make again.

What more can you want! Great flavor and always a favorite appetizer to bring to a function. Downsides: it is a little bit tricky to get the cook time perfect, the bacon goes from undercooked to overcooked burnt sugar very quickly so keep an eye on it (I prefer to undercook them and if your bringing them to an event throw them in the oven for 10 minutes to warm up and get crispy) also the clean up is tough. Tin foil will be your best friend for this recipe.

Made this for a Birthday gathering at my church today - BIG HIT!
The only change I made was to the cook time - I was baking them in two pans which I rotated every ten minutes and it took 30 minutes total for them to cook.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  I did prepare them ahead of time & kept them covered until I was ready to bake & added the brown sugar to them while the oven was pre-heating.  Mizzz Pat 
Love the Allrecipes site.

very very yummy! I kept mine in the oven for about 45 mins and these taste even better if you put a little bbq sauce on them about 10 mins from taking them out the oven. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN!

I made these today but unfortunately threw them all out. I like the bacon to be crispy so left them in the oven for 40 minutes as I Checked them at 30 and the bacon wasn't quite crisp yet. The bottoms of the sausages were burnt and I would not serve them like that! I even cooked the bacon in the microwave for two minutes first . Perhaps ill try them again sometime with some other readers suggestions to modify. Disappointed!

These little dogs are a BIG hit every time I serve them. I follow the recipe to the letter, but, I only use 12 oz of bacon as that magically produces the exact number of pieces of bacon to smokie, plus 1!  Make sure you keep an eye on the smokies in the 350° oven, as they can go from perfect to overcooked in a minute!

I made this for the family on Christmas Eve and they absolutely loved it!!  I did not make and changes and wish I had made a lot more than what I did.  I ran out of little smokies and started using hot dogs (they were good also).  I will still make this from time to time.  It's a good social snack and etc.

These divine little devils are so scrumptious!!! My kids and their friends love these things and, honestly, so I. These are heaven on a stick. If you do them right is like bite-sized brown sugar ham heaven. I can not rave about these beauties enough they are always a big hit! They take forever to prep but they are WORTH IT!

These are amazing! Someone gave my husband jalapeño bacon for the gift exchange at work. So I used it in this recipe for our Christmas party. I'm not sure there will be any left for the guests because we can't stop eating them!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! Wanted to write a review to anyone who might think like I did and use precooked bacon so would cook faster and definitely have crispy bacon!! BIG BIG BIG mistake! I realized the hard way that the brown sugar needs the fat from the bacon to melt. I ended up with lil smokies with burnt bacon and piles of brown sugar that started to burn and not melt. Made yesterday for family Christmas dinner...So disappointing because I made before with regular bacon and were amazing!!! Just wanted to put this in review so no one makes mistake I made!

I used turkey bacon for less fat. I baked as instructed then placed them in a crock pot on low to keep them warm. Everybody loved them! This recipe is a keeper.

Made them just like the recipe says. They take about 45 minutes to bake, then under the broiler for 5-10 minutes to crisp the bacon. Watch them under the broiler though; they will burn. Everybody loved them!

These are really really good. I did bake them for half an hour to make sure that the bacon was really cooked well and I just sprinkled the brown sugar on by hand til each one was just as I wanted it. Hard not to eat them all tonight but they are for church potluck tomorrow. Really really great

It takes a bit longer to prepare and twice as long to cook.  25 minutes, THEN TURN for another 15 minutes.  Well over an hour to do, not 30 minutes.

These things are addictive. I added a sprinkling of cayenne pepper on top of the sugar and had to fight my husband for the ones on my plate. They were quick and easy and will definitely be made again.

Absolutely superb!
I would recommend using toothpicks instead of the long skewers, as logic would have it, using the long skewer-it will lay flat on the cookie sheet. I have used the toothpicks and when you place each wiener/bacon wrapped skewered with toothpick on the cookie sheet..its slightly elevated and leaning on the previous wiener/bacon wrapped skewered one, not laying flat therefore not drenched in the oils.  I made it as is and towards the last few minutes, sprinkled a bit more of brown sugar on top. Once the bacon was "crisp" looking. I would like it sit for about 5 minutes so the melted brown sugar will cure and set on each wiener/bacon.  I then transfer to a slow cooker, place the lid on and set it on warm.

I made this according to the directions and it turned out amazing!  Next time I'm going to dredge the bacon pieces in the brown sugar before assembling and also sprinkle the brown sugar over the pieces as they are baking.  I used a square electric skillet that was just a little to short to accommodate the skewers I had so I used toothpicks.  In hindsight the toothpicks are easier for serving.  Can't wait to serve these again.  BTW, a  14 oz package of smokies  needed two one pound packages of thick cut bacon (cut in half).

We wrapped the little smokies in bacon and put them in layers in a crockpot. We sprinkled brown sugar liberally after a couple of layers and continued until we ran out of smokies. We had a little extra bacon which we just put on top. We cooked them on low for about 3 hours. We would definitely make them again. Yum!

10 minutes after I finished making them, they were all gone. My whole family loved them, though my brother had the most. They weren't hard to make at all! I see why this recipe was featured in the Allrecipes magazine.  They are now my second favorite food, right after nachos. Will definitely make this recipe again, but I'll make a bigger batch. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone that is planning a party or just want a snack!

These are awesome and was a favorite at a party. I cooked as per instructions but also followed suggestions by other reviewers.
1) Marinate bacon and smokies in brown sugar overnight in baggies (messy the next day but makes it tastier)
2) Put the bacon wrapped sausages on a rack (like cooling rack) so the fat from the bacon drips onto the baking sheet.
3) Covered the baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup.
Other reviewers are right about not using the skewers during baking. The caramelization of the brown sugar helps keep the bacon together.
My alteration: skewered them with toothpicks after baking for easy and less messy eating.

I only had one, because I made it for mom, dad and sister more... it was delicious. 

I only had one that was uncooked, but that was my fault, it had more bacon wrapped around it. So the outside of the sausage and the inside of the bacon was uncooked (my fault)

So easy to make and a bit hit. I actually took the bacon and coated it with brown sugar before wrapping it around the sausage. Only thing was that when I pulled it out of the oven, there was a lot of liquid in the tray since the sugar melted with the bacon on the bottom. Regardless still came out great and was yummy.

I have been making these for years but only difference is I add a tsp of cayenne to the brown sugar mix. It adds a nice heat to the sweet smokey yumminess of these.

These were very good,  and were finished off before any of the others. I used Wright brand hickory smoked bacon.  Found some bamboo slivers instead of tooth picks and soaked them in water over night. I turned half way through the cooking and added more brown sugar. Outstanding!!

These are really awesome!  One of my guests started eating them and above the crowd announced OMG THESE ARE LIKE CRACK!  Lol. They are really good :-). We make at least 2 cookie sheets full of them, and i swear they disappear faster than you can blink.

4 stars mostly because it was fairly simple to prepare and cooked relatively quickly, though definitely a lot longer than 20 minutes.  I think that may have been due to using the thicker bacon cut.  May try a thinner style next time but definitely will make again.

These were a huge hit, I would bake the bacon and smokies for about 20 minutes first then add the sugar to prevent burning.

I hate smoked anything, so I just used regular  hot dogs cut in pieces. Excellent recipe! I hate it when people change everything and then rate a recipe, but I wanted to give this recipe the credit it deserves, even though I do not like smokies.

These were delicious and the plate was empty quickly! I followed the recommendations of other users by coating the smokies and bacon in brown sugar and then putting them in the fridge for a couple of hours. I then coated the outside again with sugar and placed them on the baking sheet and then poured the sugary liquid over them before baking. They definitely had plenty of sweetness. When I make them again I might not roll them in sugar that second time. I also just put them on the baking sheet with the bacon seam side down and after they were done I put a toothpick through them and put them on the serving platter. That made the prep time faster. I was concerned that the bacon I used was too think, but they were crispy and delicious after 45 min in the oven.

Delicious, never would have thought it given the ingredients.

Not sure why some are complaining they broiled then burnt them. It clearly says bake at 350.  Takes about 1/2 an hr.

I partially cooked the bacon first so it would crisp up nice in the oven.  We never have any leftovers when I make this at parties.

These were a big hit for Christmas. Everyone loved them, and there were a couple of picky  eaters there and they gobbled these up. There  is a suggestion I have when prepping  these, I lined my counter top with saran wrap and placed the sliced bacon on it, then I sprinkled some brown sugar on the bacon, rolled it around the lil smokies and put in a ziplock bag and sprinkled a little more brown sugar on and let them marinate over night. The clean up was easy, in fact there wasn't much at all. This  is a keeper.

Made this for my Christmas party. These went over very well.  My only recommendation would be to use a aluminum throw away pan under a rack tray.  And definitely double the recipe. They disappear fast!  Making again for New Year's Day!

I read a lot of reviews before I attempted this for 2015 Thanksgiving party. Anyway, they turned out fabulous! I cut bacon in 3rds (could have been 4ths) and dredged both the bacon and the smokies in the brown sugar separately, then assembled them together. I used tooth picks to hold bacon in place, but only pushed it through one side and as I layered them on the foiled backing pan, I placed the toothpick part under the next Lil' Smokie to avoid the toothpick burning a few reviewers warned about. Also, halfway through the cooking I turned them over to assure bacon cooked properly. The foil was pretty sticky and messy already so I grabbed a second tray and put foil on it and transferred to second pan and finished cooking. Great idea and remember to place the smokies over it's neighbors toothpick and no burning. After they were finished cooking,  I put them in a small slow cooker  on warm setting  and they stayed perfect until consumed over the next few hours! Many awesome comments received and I will make these again soon! I made on of the dips suggested, but not as good reviews on it.

Love these! Instead of doing everything in one day, I followed another reviewers advice and prepped the night before then let them marine.. the next day I poured the marinade on top and baked them in the oven.. Delicious! It leaves a brown sugar coat on top as opposed to a light dusting..

These are so addicting! I marinate my smokies in brown sugar overnight. If you have a rack you bake these on then that helps with the grease a lot. Otherwise the bottom part of the wrapped smokie gets slightly mushy from all the grease. Baking time does need to be increased if you want crispier bacon.

My wife made these for a work party - yes even my wife can cook when she wants to.  These were awesome.  I ate a ton of them.  

When we were leaving, someone else was grabbing the left over stuff she brought and pointed at these.  (She didn't know we made them).  She said" those are the best thing here".  I couldn't agree more.  Umm, tasty

So simple and oh so yummy! I've made these a few times and they are always the first appetizer to go. I put the sausages in a ziplock with brown sugar for 15-20 minutes then roll them in bacon. I've tried dredging the bacon in brown sugar and couldn't tell a difference so I roll the whole smokie in brown sugar before putting them on a cooling rack over a jelly roll pan. I've used a broiler rack but prefer the wider open slats of a cooling rack on top of a broiler pan or jelly roll pan because the bacon gets crispier. Make sure to line the pan with foil. I find it takes about 30 minutes to cook. Turn them over halfway so all sides get crispy.

These were a hit at the party! I only cut the bacon in half (not in three), and used a toothpick to secure each one individually. Pressed each into a little bit of brown sugar and popped them the oven. I think it only took a few minutes per side (def less than 10)... perfection

Everybody loved this.  They were pretty greasy, but nobody cared and I did get requests for the recipe.  My challenge was figuring out how to keep them warm.  After cooking, they put them in the oven at 150 for 2 hours.  That could have added to the greasyness.  BUT oh so yummy.  Sweet and salty.  People swore I put maple syrup in them.  Nope.  By the way, Little Smokies no longer come in 1 pound packages.  I only 1 pound of bacon for 2 lil smokies packages.

These were awesome.  To save time day of serving I prepped smokies day ahead, placing on toothpicks and then covered them with the brown sugar. Then, into the refrig overnight, ready to place on cookie sheet to bake day to serve. These were gobbled up like wildfire!  Thank you for a terrific recipe!!

I've made this a couple times before and they always taste amazing! I cut the bacon into halves lengthwise instead of thirds and press them in sugar before wrapping them around sausages, using more than the recipe recommends. I put them 5 pieces to a skewer and use a pan with taller sides so I can place the skewers across the pan without the sausages actually touching the pan so the grease doesn't affect the bacon's crispiness. When I baked them, I used the recommended 350 degrees and baked them without flipping them over for 20 minutes, checking on them every five until the ends of the sausages are brown (originally more red) but not burnt. amazing recipe! thanks for the idea tina!

These are excellent, however, it'll take you longer than 10 mins to wrap an entire pack of smokies. Great appetizer that everyone will love. I usually have to make two pans because they go so fast.

I put these in the crockpot for 3.5 hours on high.  They weren't crispy.  I picked them out of their grease and put on a plate to serve.  They get a lot of grease in the crockpot.  They probably would have been excellent if I put them in the oven to crisp them when I removed them from the crockpot.

I've made these often although I sprinkle a little cayenne over the brown sugar that gives a little zip. My family calls this "meat crack" because it's so addicting.

I had bacon left over so I dbl wrapped some.  Used tooth picks and baked with brown sugar at 350 for 45 minutes and turned 3 times in the process then broiled for 3 minutes at 475...about a minute too long but oh well. Still tastey! Oh and it wasn't messy at all. My cutting board had to be washed and I soaked my pan for about thirty minutes. Didn't use foil. Great recipe!

Just made this for a party. Huge hit.. everyone asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe, put foil on baking sheets and cooked them on wire racks at 400 for 1 hour.  They were crunchy and yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful, made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were perfect. Time consuming but soooo good. Everyone loved them. I will try to make them a little easier next time, don't know exactly how but have some time to think about it.

Loved the flavor but made a mess while cooking. Couldn't get the bacon to crisp up, so pulled out the smokies and laid the bacon flat to crisp, but ended up with blackened bacon. Not sure what I did wrong.

I followed the reviews that suggested broiling on the middle rack for 15-20 mins and flipping halfway through which worked perfectly. This crisped the bacon up nicely. These were delicious little crowd pleasers! Some people liked mustard on the side. I will definitely make again!

Made these tonight and they were a hit with the family.  I will say that the smokies that got a little bit darker were the better tasting ones.  New party food recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

i have made these before, I love the little smokies, but I buy the light little smokies, a few less calorie's but not missed, less greasy, I use turkey bacon (don't omg me) I cut bacon in thirds, coat with brown sugar, then with a paper towel micro wave them until they are half done, but still rollable, with that grease left behind on paper towels, add more brown sugar and use the oven to heat the lite smokies, sorry about how long, I just an eye on them, until hot, then put broiler and turn them once to finish the crisping of the turkey, a lot less grease, every body loves them, the woman even like them, I tell them the less calories, the men inhale them, haven't had a complaint, they are glued to the game, and a few beers, they have never asked that they taste different.

I have made this recipe several times. What I have found is that little smokies end up swimming in the fat that melts off the bacon as it cooks. I've tried pre-cooking the bacon to cook off the fat and wrapping it around the smokies while it is still soft. However, I still find the fat a problem. I have not tried putting them on a rack. Has anyone tried this?

I was the hit of our block Christmas party this year for bringing these!!! Everyone raved, and kept asking about what makes it sweet. The bacon brand makes a difference too... I used Benton's which I order online and arrives frozen.  It's thick bacon so takes longer to cook. I used Hillshire Farm Turkey Lilt'l Sausages.  I followed another review suggestion which was to microwave for a few minutes first, then bake, and finally out more sugar on and broil for just a few minutes... watch closely though as more than about 2-3 minutes of broil and you'll end up with burnt bacon. I came close, next time will only broil a minute then will flip them and broil another minute or two. Awesome recipe!!!

These almost didn't last long enough to take them to the party, I had to fend off my husband and housemate. Really tasty. Messy but simple to make. I used brown sugar bacon to start and the broiling pan was a good idea. Cooked for about 35 minutes.

This was a great hit at the party.  The only thing I would change is to cut the bacon slice in 1/4 and then wrap the smokees and roll them brown sugar.  The bacon didn't seem to cook all the way through, enough for me.  It took at least 45 minutes and i increased the temp to 400.

This is one of my go to crowd pleasing appetizers.  I've been making this for years but with MAPLE bacon.  I give it 5 stars with the maple bacon!

These were amazing and only lasted a few minutes at my party. Like others, I was liberal with the brown sugar and coated the bacon and smokies before assembling them. I placed them in a warm crock pot after baking them to create a nice, sugary sauce. They were so yummy!

This tasted disturbingly weird.  I'm all for maple sausages or bacon, but the amount of sugar in this recipe was too overwhelming when mixed with the savory bacon and sausages.

Believe the hype. These were the most popular dish at the party I brought them to. I followed the advice of others by letting the bacon and smokies sit overnight (separately) in the brown sugar. Then I skewered them, baked them til crispy, then layered them in a crock pot with the juice that I saved from the overnight sitting of the meats in the sugar (not the pan drippings). I also served them with the "Tiger Dill Sauce" that someone put on here. I love horseradish and the bite of the sauce was a perfect foil to the sweet smokies. I also added a tiny bit of bbq sauce to the juice. I usually hate when people change up a recipe a bunch and then rate it, but this is a solid recipe. Will make again. Tons of requests for the recipe!!!

This was a huge hit at the Super Bowl party last night! My husband (who's idea of cooking is heating up Stouffer's lasagna) made these because of the bacon and everyone raved about them! They are still talking about them on Facebook the next morning. We doubled the recipe and had about 10 left over...will definitely make this a family recipe.

So Yummy! Definitely don't skimp on the brown sugar if anything next time I might add a little extra the sweet-salty combination is delicious. Unfortunately, at my own fault, I made these with a really tasty bacon wrapped tater tot appetizer and the two bacon appetizers was just too much bacon, in the future I will stick to one at a time.

So easy and so delicious. Grandson who is 5 years old said, "these are awesome" and proceeded to make them dinner rather than an appetizer. Don't need a dipping sauce to ruin their delicate flavor.

This recipe is amazing but I got to say I didn't put as much sugar on top because it takes forever to cook and you don't want it to be super sweet either. So I only put about half a cup on both sides. Definitely will make this again :D

I make a version of this...instead of sprinkling the brown sugar on top I dredge the bacon in brown sugar making sure to get a lot on both sides...then I wrap the bacon around the little smokies and skewer them and bake them.  That way you have the brown sugar glaze on both sides of the bacon-I was told they were more like candy than sausages.

These were great! They take a really long time to cook though, so be warned. You have to cook them until the brown sugar glazes and they crisp up, or else they are fatty and soggy. And they make a mess on the bottom of your pan. Next time I will try baking them on a cooling rack, without toothpicks since I won't have to turn them that way, and with a tin foil sheet underneath for the mess. I might add a bit of pepper for some kick.

This recipe was time intensive but worth it.  I broiled them on low after baking for a while for the bacon to crisp up.

This is a great appetizer to take when the hostess asks you to bring something and men love it as well as women.  I know it's a hit when the hostess asks me for the recipe.

FANTASTIC recipie!!! :) We made this for a large pot-luck gathering, at first I was hesitant but being a bacon dish it's hard to go wrong so we went with it and every little smokie was devoured.

Oh my God!  I am doing the catering for my son's wedding and my future daughter-in-law requested these.  Of course I had to try them out first.  I made as directed but instead baked them on my stoneware.  They can out crispy on all sides with no need to turn.  They are fantastic.  I didn't read the reviews until they were in the oven, so although they were the bomb, I'm definitely going to try tossing them with brown sugar first and marinate them.  Not to sure you can improve on perfect, but worth the try.

I am asked constantly to make these. Everyone loves them. A reviewer once suggested putting the brown sugar into a bowl and rolling the little smokies through it before putting it onto the baking pan. That has been a great tip, as it gets a nice even layer of sweetness on there. This is a definite keeper for my family!

These were ok. I don't see how they would get crispy without putting them under the broiler. Other reviews said you didn't need to skewer them, that they would stick together. Well I didn't and only a few of them stayed rolled up. The taste was alright but I think I will stick to the candied kielbasa recipe.

I had these at an office luncheon this week and they are delicious. I thought they'd be too salty or fatty tasting, but the sweetness of the brown sugar, saltiness of the bacon and the smokey flavor from the smokies combine to make a yummy bite of flavor explosion.

This is one of our fav football snacks.  I normally made them according to the recipe, however, this weekend I decided to go with alot of recommendations and increase brown sugar.  My husband and I could not even eat them.  Our fav thing about this recipe is the combination sausage, bacon and sugar flavor.  Once you increase brown sugar, all you taste is brown sugar.  They were FAR too sweet.  Unless you are ready for something really really sweet, I would make as suggested!

We call this Man Candy. I cook these for 8 hours on low in a crock pot. I use black pepper bacon and sprinkle red pepper flakes over each layer before smothering the layer with brown sugar. I even add more brown sugar during cooking. These disappear quickly when I make them.

Tastes great and everyone loves them!!  The only problem I had was that after sprinkling the brown sugar over them it didn't melt all over the smokies instead it just sorta burnt on top in little clumps the way it had fallen when crumbled.  I'd love some suggestions on how to solve this issue!  Otherwise amazing. Make extras they go fast.

I made these for a shower and everyone loved them.  It was quite tedious wrapping all of those sausages (5 lbs.) but it was worth it.  I followed other reviewers' advice and lined my pans with foil.  I also rolled each bacon wrapped sausage in a bowl of brown sugar before cooking.  Now my hubby wants to have them every Saturday!

I knew this would be great--how could you go wrong with bacon, little smokies, and brown sugar? My kids were skeptical, but chowed down on the finished product! We did as another reviewer suggested and put them in a container with the brown sugar, shook them, then put them in  the fridge for a couple of hours before baking. Sooooo good!!

Katy bar the door! At our barbeque, these went first. The guys particularly liked them, although everyone had some. I made two pounds of smokies and am glad I did. After baking them, I put them in a crockpot to stay warm. Labor intensive but worth the effort.

These were the bomb.com. Triple the recipe. You'll need to cook them for at least 30 minutes to get crisp bacon. I set up a pan with parchment paper and asked my kids and husband to "prep" for me while I got ready.  They were so kind to do it; however, the smokies were wrapped a mess... loose, scewered on the side all the way through.  I thanked them for their work, quickly dropped a cup of brown sugar on the pan and threw them in the oven.  WOW; they ROCKED and got eaten up at a function first thing among many family appetizers. I'm making them again tonight for another function. PTK!

Let me start off by saying these are very delicious. BUT I do not think they are worth the trouble, because they are a little difficult to work with, very messy, and cleanup is a pain. I think "pigs in a blanket" are always so popular, it is not worth using this recipe.

I made these for a church function tonight. WOW!!! I doubled the recipe and they were gone in about 10 minutes!!!! I didn't start them in time so I was in a hurry.... I turned them on broil for the last 5 minutes of cooking and carmelized the tops and gave it an extra brown sugar crunch.... It was sooooo good!!!

If I could give these 10 stars, I would. These are the best and so easy to make. You can make them ahead and keep them in the fridge and then just pop them in the oven when it's time. I recently brought them over to a superbowl party.. cooked them at home and put them in the slowcooker to keep warm.. delicious! It was the only appetizer that was finished!

Easy and delicious.   I used center cut back and cut each strip in half, using one half for each sausage.   No toothpicks necessary.. just wrapped them and rolled them in brown sugar, pressing the sugar on as thick as possible.   Baked on cookie sheet lined with tin foil and with cooking spray and they crisped up fine after 40-45 mins (turning them once).

DELICIOUS!!! Took other suggestions and coated bacon and smokies w/ brown sugar first - then coated again in more brown sugar once bacon was wrapped around smokies. Definately use a broiler pan. Skewers really do make this much easier to deal with. These were a huge hit!

I love this recipe, but i'm always looking to jazz up any flavor, so i took the brown sugar and added a touch of teryaki sauce. In a sauce pan melt the brown sugar and teryaki,  drizzle the sauce over the smokies then bake in the oven. mmmmmmhmmmm so good!!!!

This recipe was so easy and truly a crowd pleaser for both yound and old.  I served it at my Christmas Party and it was the first thing to disappear.  My 7-year old son LOVED these.  My 5-year old was my assembly assistant.  I have made them on three more occassions.  Definitely a keeper.

It was very good, but very greasy. Everyone who had more than 5 had an upset stomach that night. Next time I might use a lower fat bacon. Otherwise it was yummy

These were pretty good.  I threaded them on skewers after assembling them and baked them on a rack since I didn't want to deal with all those toothpicks.

These were delicious!  I did marinate them in the brown sugar for about 1 hour.  Then is put them on a baking sheet covered with foil, sprinkled extra brown sugar on them and baked them for 45 minutes.  Crispy and yummy!   ***Do remove them immediately from the foil after baking or they stick!

I could not find little smokies, so I used breakfast sausage and cut them. I would use a little less brown sugar.

Wow, I've made these twice now and they are gone in minutes! The second time I let them marinate in the brown sugar overnight in the fridge and it made it more flavorful. I am making again tomorrow for a New Years' Eve party! Thanks!!

These are awesome.  Be sure to cook them fully (45 minutes). We marinated them overnight in the brown sugar and then sprinkled more on them just before baking.

Yum! I use Hickory Farms Mini Beef Sausage Snacks. It can be a little time-consuming and messy (as I dredge both the bacon and sausage in brown-sugar like other reviewers suggest), but it's all worth it when you pop this little piece of heaven into your mouth.

I made these for my son's birthday party and they were instantly gone! I also suggest letting the bacon wrapped smokies sit in the brown sugar for at least a day.

Gone in 60 seconds!  Well, maybe more like 10 minutes, but WOW!  these were a hit a Christmas party last night.  I used only a sprinkling of sugar on each little smokie and they were great.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I didn't realize how fattening these were. They also came out too carmelized from the brown sugar.

Always a favorite. I get requests for these all the time. A trick I use to cook the bacon a little more and not burn the sugar; is to transfer the lil smokies to a new foil lined baking sheet once the brown sugar starts to burn. This also allows the bacon to crisp up some.

I was catering a small get together and made these. People started showing so i put them out and when i went back into the room they were gone and i tripled the recipe. I never got to try them so i made another time just to taste. These are  great. The only thing i did was follow someone's idea of leaving them in the frig overnight. ty ty for such a great recipe it is a keeper for sure.

I love the easy recipes and this is the all time easiest!  Rave reviews - had this as an app at a Brd Meeting - everyone loved it!  Nothing was left over!  I used the thin sliced bacon - it crisps up faster.  Another good tip is - when you take it off the baking sheet - wash the pan asap - brown sugar is very hard to get off if the pan gets cool.

Meat Candy as it's lovingly known is a huge hit at all over our gatherings. It takes a bit of time to put together but it is so worth it. I always have to double the recipe so that I am sure to get some myself.

This is my absolute favorite appetizer! I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before. I make as stated and everyone loves it. I do keep it in there about 45 mins and then broil for a few minutes because I like crisp bacon. Love it! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great!  I always make this one for pot lucks or football game days.  Our friends always request these, and they're gone in a flash.  I also use maple flavored bacon, which makes them even more "mapley".  Really good!

A sweet cured meat bullet to the face.  Strong sweet and spicy flavors.  Definitely make the sauce recipe that goes with these.  I shook cayenne on top of them and that was awesome.  Easy recipe and easy to alter.  I pressed both sides of bacon in brown sugar as prep.

Such an easy recipe, but absolutely the easiest dish I've ever taken to a potluck.  Had so many compliments on this dish and requests for the recipe.  Almost hate to admit how simple the recipe is.  This is a dish kids and adults both love.  I did cook longer so the brown sugar would melt, but if you cook too long it turns into a hard tough inedible coating so watch very carefully if you are cooking longer than the recommended time.

I used turkey bacon, and used a toothpick (2 to each one).  I also cooked the smokies for about 10 min. longer and flipped them 1/2 way through, I like crispy bacon.  I cannot believe how easy and good these were.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

We LOVE these! They are SO, SO easy to make, and they taste spectacular. They are heavy on the sugar, however...so stay away from them if you are trying to watch the pounds!

These were messy but so much fun to make, eat and share!  My guest loved them and my family did too.  We've made these just for the heck of it.  Like others, we really smother them in brown sugar and cook until the bacon is crispy.  Try this appetizer, you'll be glad you did!

I also would rate these higher if I could.. whoever came up with this recipe is a genius.  The only thing I do differently is I skewer them individually on toothpicks then roll them in brown sugar, and bake them in a foil pan that I can just throw away because the cleanup is a hassle.  I also like to broil them for a couple of minutes after baking to get the bacon nice and crispy.  I leave them on the toothpick skewers so people can avoid the sticky fingers that comes with picking them up.  They are DELICIOUS, and soon you too will be the toast of the picnic if you bring these around!

Love it, Love it, Love it. I would rate this higher if I could!! I did lay the bacon flat and added brown before I rolled the smokies, then aded the brown sugar on top once they were rolled. I cooked them for a while then turned on broil and flipped them over to make sure they were crispy all the way around. I took them to a memorial day cookout and they were gone within 1/2 hour.

made this a few weeks ago and everybody LOVED them!!!  i did as suggested in other reviews and kinda swiped the bacon in the brown sugar before i rolled the smokies, plus sprinkled extra brown sugar on top at the end.  DELICIOUS!!!  i only wish it weren't so messy to clean up!  but it's so good it's worth the mess!  will defintely make again.

This recipe was so good I had to make it twice in one day! My fiance and I were holding a house warming over the weekend and I fix these as one of the many finger foods available...I'm not exhagerating when I say that they were gone maybe 10 minutes after I put them out.  Luckily I had a lot of stuff leftover so I just hopped into the kitchen and made more since they're so easy to make.  My grocery store didn't have any of the sausage ones available so I grabbed the mini beef franks and they worked just as well although I know they would be even better with sausage.  Either way...AMAZING recipe!!!!

This recipe is truly amazing!  I dredged the bacon strips first in brown sugar before wrapping around the smokies, and I added more sugar on top after rolling them up.  Also, if your bacon isn't getting as crisp as you would like, put the pan under the broiler to finish for delicious caramelization.  A recipe I use over and over again because everyone loves them.  They are even great cold out of the refrigerator for a midnight snack!

These were pretty good, but not quite good enough for me to go to the trouble of wrapping all those little sausages in bacon again any time soon. I doubled the recipe and took them to a party.  Most of them were eaten, but no one really commented on them.  For that much work, I want something to WOW everyone.  Next time, I'll dump a bottle of barbecue sauce on them and call it done.

These were good, but I either used too much sugar or baked them too long. They were a little too sweet, and we all had to pick the goey sugar out of our teeth.I baked them for about 45 minutes, but I'll try what the recipe says next time.I've had these using brown and serve sausages, and those are really good too.

Very messy clean up after. I would recommend putting aluminum foil lining down on the pan first. I also used turkey bacon to lighten up the fat content a bit. Not the greatest, but pretty tasty

We made these for a Superbowl crowd that loves pigs in a blanket so when they saw these sitting next to the pigs in a blanket, they were skeptical. Well, what was left on the plate? Not these, these were gone in under half an hour. The pigs a blanket made it well past half time. Easy to make and a great recipe!

I made these for the Super Bowl and WOW! They are every bit as tasty and delicious as advertised and very simple to put together. I definitely recommend thinly sliced bacon and recommend the use of as much brown sugar as possible. After rolling the smokey in the sugar and then dredging the bacon through it, I tucked extra sugar in with each one as I rolled it up and then covered them all with a generous sprinkling before the pan went into the oven.  So, so, so crispy and sugary and good.

These were pretty good wrapped in bacon, but the brown sugar was a bit too much.

I made these for Superbowl and they flew off the plate.  I cooked on a broiler pan at 400 degrees for 20 mintues (give or take).  They cooked perfectly, the fat dripped off, and the bacon was nice and crisp.  But it needed some help with the brown sugar.  So I took them off the broiler pan and placed in oven pan, poured the brown sugar from the broiler over it, and baked it off another couple minutes.

AWESOME!!!!!! I made these for our Superbowl party and I could not get enough. I was actually depressed when we ran out! I will definitely be making these again. I put them on skewers and baked them over a deep casserole dish so it would catch the bacon grease and they wouldn't be soggy. Baked them for 20 minutes, then flipped and baked an additional 20 minutes. After that I broiled them for a couple minutes since I like my bacon real crispy. Brown sugar really set it off, thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like these at all, but since all the guys did, I'm giving 4 stars. These have to be flipped if you want the bacon on the bottom to be anywhere close to done. I didn't marinade the night before, as I was wanting to truly rate the recipe, and it def. could have used more brown sugar since most of it cooks off. Baked them on skewers on cooling racks and they were still way too greasy to be any where near appetizing for me. Fat wrapped in fat is indeed an excellent name for them.

These are awesome! I had made them several times in the past but had forgot about them for many years until I saw it again on this site. I made them for my new husband and his friends for poker night last week. They raved about them and even re-named them "fat wrapped in fat". With a name like that they have to be good! They have been requested for the superbowl party! I will make a double batch this time.

I've been making these for over 20 years but use a crock pot and take them to family and work get-togethers.  I use turkey bacon or sizzalean.  You just leave the slow cooker on low and stir every once in a while.  Total hit and you can get a lot of these little babies in a crock pot.  What a treat.  I think I make them about 2-3 times a year.  But now that I see this recipe on here making them in an oven, I will be making them more often at home for a quick treat rather than a huge ordeal.

This recipe is great!!  I made these for both New Years Eve and the NFL playoffs and they all disappeared.  Even my picky teen who doesn't like anything ate them and has been asking me to make them again.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!!

This has been a family fave since the 1970's! The key is letting the brown sugar melt over the smokies(before baking) to achieve that honey baked goodness. Men simply adore these....perfect Football Sunday food!

I made these for a baby shower brunch and they were a big hit. I wrapped the bacon around the smokies the night before and tossed them in the brown sugar the next morning. Use the release aluminum foil to bake for easy clean up. Delicious!

Time consuming but worth it!  I suppose everyone makes these a little different but I cut the bacon into 3rds, wrap each smokie in a 1/3 slice of bacon and roll it around in the brown sugar to cover.  I put all the brown sugar covered smokies in a container overnight and then put them out on a foil lined cookie sheet and brush the brown sugar liquid over the smokies.  They are sticky and messy when done but as they cool they caramelize and aren't that messy ~ just delicious!

Awesome - everyone loved them! I tried to broil them as people suggested and I thought I ruined them b/c the bacon began to burn. I discovered a lot of people love burnt bacon b/c everyone loved them just the way they were!

simple and tasty...what more could you ask for in an appetizer??

i did bake them on a grid to let the fat drip off, which made me feel a bit better (given how many i ate!) and they still tasted yummy!

I got so many raves about this recipe! They are easy to make and taste so good. My husband and I made them the night before and soaked them in brown sugar overnight that was fun to do that with the hubby! I cooked mine in the crock pot until the bacon was done and throughout the day was adding brown sugar to the and giving them a little stir. yum!

These are awesome!  I made them for a holiday buffet and they were the first to get eaten.  I would recommend baking them in a pan with a raised bottom to catch drippings or to blot them off on paper towel after baking.  I pulled them out of the oven and directly put them on the table and I thought they were a little greasy.

This was a big party favorite! I used toothpicks instead of skewers and baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. I also added a touch of maple syrup. Very good!

I did as others suggested, marinated in brown sugar for a couple of hours.  I also used maple bacon and added some maple syrup to the marinade.  These went really fast, one of the girls ate almost a dozen of them herself.  I used cheddar mini smokies, I think next time I will look for just regular smokies.

I thought these were pretty good except that they were really greasy. I made them for a party and some people loved them and some people thought they were too greasy. I will make them again but next time I will use center cut bacon so it doesn't taste like I am eating a piece of fat. I would recommend them though.

I made these yesterday and was a bit disappointed in them.  They were sure a lot of work, and we didn't find them to be the "hit" that so many others did.  I used turkey bacon, made them the night before like others suggested and baked them then put into a crock pot to keep warm.  The brown sugar seemed to disappear and these weren't that sweet.  I'm sure I won't be making these again anytime soon.

I made these for our Christmas party last night. We were really expecting them to be outstanding because of the rave reviews and the delicious ingredients. My husband was VERY eager to taste them. When he taste-tested one right out of the oven, he said, "They're okay. See what you think."  I had to agree.  All in all, they were just okay. I did them on a broiler pan with a foil-lined bottom, so cleanup was easy, and then kept them warm in the crock pot during the party.  We had a lot left over and I will probably end up throwing them out.  I won't make these again.

These are perfect just the way they are made.  You can also add a little syrup to make them a little juicier if you would like.  Also, I used toothpicks and they are the perfect snack!

I made the smokies a day ahead of time as per other's suggestions. I also smothered the container (that they were stored in)with brown sugar and cooked them for about 30 minutes in their own juices. They were sweet, crispy on the outside, salty, and chewy on the inside. I already received a request for them for next year's christmas party. Thanks

AWESOME!  Our favorite finger food and a must have on our buffet for hors d'oeuvres night.  It's hard to get the brown sugar to stay on the wrapped up dogs, so I tried putting brown sugar on a plate and then patting strips of bacon into sugar and then rolling up the dogs ... neither way is better.  Sprinkling seems easier!  Super tasty nonetheless.

I used turkey bacon and they were still incredibly good. Also make sure you get a good covering of brown sugar goo on each one as you are removing them from the pan. Makes them taste yummier and saves a little effort on clean up.

These are the best for sport game nights where there are men in the room. They will adore you for these candy meat. It's true when they say do not skimp on brown sugar! Darker brown sugars are better than lighter ones. I would try making these with maple syrup crystals if they weren't so expensive...maybe mix some with brown sugar!

I'm giving this 5 stars because  everyone loved them and they did go fast!  I just wasn't happy with the way my burned a little on the bottom. I threaded the bacon-wrapped smokies on metal skewers, placed them on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet, sprinkled the brown sugar over all, then baked for about 30 minutes. The brown sugar melted into a black gooey mess underneath all the skewers, but no one but me cared!  Next time I'll try some of the other suggestions of coating the bacon with the sugar, THEN wrapping them up and stick them in the fridge for a few hours before baking. I'm sure no matter how they turn out they will still go fast!  I think it's also because they are quick to grab and easier than having to dip something or spread something on a cracker. Very tasty though, and will definately be making them again, no matter WHAT the reason is! :)

I did as another reviewer suggested and dredged the bacon in brown sugar then rolled it around the little smokie.  Definitely use center cut bacon - much better all around and will stick to itself so you don't need to cook w/ toothpicks in them.  I put toothpicks in them after cooking in broiler pan at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes on each side.  They were a HUGE hit!!

I made these on Super Bowl Sunday (I know the review is a bit late, lol) and they were a hit!  Such a simple recipe but really great flavor - sweet, smoky, meaty.  I cooked the second batch a bit longer than recommended to really brown the bacon and cook the sugar.  Good stuff!

GREAT RECIPES! easy to make and very tasty!

I sprinkled brown sugar on the bacon before wrapping them up, and then rolled the whole thing in brown sugar again. And in the last 10 minutes in the oven, I sprinkled some more on top of the wraps. 
It goes really well with fresh pineapple chunks!

Wow! These were soooo good!  These were eaten so quickly at the baby shower, they were the first item to disappear.  I'm not even a "smokies" fan, but I loved them.  For the sugar, I used sucanat.  It worked great.

Easy to make.  Be sure to line your broiler pan with foil, as they are a sticky mess!  I cut the bacon in thirds.  I agree that men love them :-)

These were very good. However, my husband would not allow me to turn the oven on to make them because it was so hot outside and he didn't want the AC to work any harder so he had the brainy idea to put the broiler pan on the grill. Don't do this. They took way too long to cook (we have a Holland grill than can't really over cook anything) and just didn't come out the way I had hoped. But I can't wait to try them again. The taste was great but I would have enjoyed more of the brown sugar flavor. Thanks!

This recipe was a hit! I made these for my husband's surprise party and everyone loved them!
I used toothpicks for each one of them and let them in the fridge overnight with the brown sugar. 
I also made the dip and it was great!

I've made these for several family functions and they are ALWAYS a hit. I made them yesterday for MEmorial day and my husband told me he is requesting that I make them at least once a week! LOL Cause they always fly off the plate and he only gets one or two when I serve them at parties.

Great recipe! Easy, fast and excellent when you want to impress guests with something tasty. I didn't have to use toothpick because the bacon stuck in place and the edges that did come off became extra crispy. Yum!

These were great, especially for a football game or other man event.  It definitely takes about twice as much brown sugar as you would imagine looking at it.

I've made this for new years eve party and also a girls get together, it got rave reviews both times! Others complained about this being a messy recipe but i disagree. It took about 20 minutes to prep 2 packs of smokies. I sliced the entire pack of bacon into thirds to save time. i added to a crockpot after they were cooked.  Definitely a winner!

Awesome.  I like them more syrupy so I cut down the time a bit, I just eyeball them.  However, dh likes them "crispy", so for his the smokies either get reg. or extended cooking time.  I don't care for them like that.  A bit dry, imo. Every time I make these, people can't stop raving about them.  Thanks!

These little suckers taste great! Everyone asks for the recipe.  The reason I'm giving them four stars is because they just take so much darn time.  They are a lot of work for an appetizer...and can turn into a greasy mess if you don't let the grease drain while cooking.  I bake them on the broiler pan with holes and line the bottom pan with tin foil to catch all the grease.  Works fine for clean up. A great "manly" appetizer.

these were great!  Liked by children and adults.  I will definitely make these again.  Just a couple of notes.  I will cut the bacon in fourths as I had more sausages than I had bacon.  I think that I will also put foil on the pan before baking to make clean-up a little easier.

These were great.  I did have an issue with the bacon browning though as others did.  In fact, after almost 50 minutes, I did what a few others recommended and turned the broiler on HIGH.  That browned the bacon extremely quickly.  I probably should have started at LOW.  I will definitely make these again, though not too often as they aren't exactly a low-fat food. :)

Can I give these a 10 for taste? They are so yummy. I baked them for 20 minutes and then broiled for a few minutes on each side to crisp the bacon. Delicious. I made the sauce recommended here (1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. chili sauce, 1/2 c. brown sugar) and the sauce was yummy too - but not necessary.

I have been making these for years and people always fall in love with them at first bite!  I put a toothpick on each individual smokie, not several on one skeewer.  This makes for easy selecting for your party goers.  For all those that think this is time consuming and messy, please get out of the kitchen.  This is the easiest recipe I know!

I enjoyed making these - easy to make and very good to eat.  Made one small change, coated the baking pan with a brown sugar and water mixture.  This added more sweetness to the taste.  A big hit and will make them again!!

I made these for the first time around Thanksgiving and have made them for parties ever since then.  They are soooo good!  I do make them atleast 5 hours before I cook them so they can get good and juicy and I use a ton of brown sugar...I smear it real good into the bacon and roll the smokies in it too.  Awesome!

No one at my party cared for these, and I made them exactly as stated. I did find that I had to turn the smokies to get the bacon to cook, and it took way longer to get it all cooked than the recipe noted.

That said, I won't make these again. Glad I tried them, though.

These little wonders went instantly at my New Years party. I do recommend the broiling pan, and next time I will line the bottom pan with foil becuase it is a sticky slimy mess I am not looking forward to cleaning.

I made these for Christmas and they went over great. None left. I had so many on the broiler pan that I couldn't turn them so I just left them in the oven a bit longer. We had two different sauces should anyone want to dip them but they were eaten as is. A keeper recipe.

These things taste great! Only problem I had was I didn't have a pan/w sides, so the oil was dripping off the sides of the pan excessively.

Served at a Christmas party. I did put brown sugar over them all night the night before, then baked. Served from a crock pot on low setting. Some people at the party flipped for them.

I took these to a party and turned my back and when I came back to try them--the plate was empty and everyone loved them. To save time, I used a foil baking pan and then threw it away to save clean up. I took them out of oven and immediately took to party. They cooled off but were still good and did not overcook.

This was great. I was worried about the mess, bacon grease and brown sugar. So I lined the bottom of a broiler pan with foil, and sprayed the top pan with cooking spray. Clean up was a snap. I just pitched the foil and the top washed so easy. They were so GOOD! My husband ate almost a whole batch. I had to take them away from him. Bravo.

WOW! WOW! WOW! I took the suggestion to roll the bacon in brown sugar and let it 'marinate' overnight.  So simple to make!  EVERYONE asked for the recipe!  This will become a regular in our holiday party menu!

I made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks for gatherings - both times there were no leftovers.  This recipe is very easy - the first time I made them I dredged the smokies and the bacon in the brown sugar before rolling, then let them sit in the fridge overnight.  The second time I just rolled them without dredging, threw them in a freezer bag, poured in a bunch of brown sugar, and put them in the fridge for a day before broiling them.  Both times they turned out great.  I rated this 4 stars just because I'm not a huge smokie fan - but my guests seemed to love them!

What could be more simple than these? Nothing!! They are simple to make, cheap, and are always a hit! What I love about them is that you get the taste of the smokies without having to drown them in some disgusting BBQ sauce in a crock pot....you know you have all had that recipe at a party!!!

Loved this.. I thought they would be too fatty and greasy for my taste, but they were fantastic. I did as others suggested and let them marinate in a plastic bag with the brown sugar. I cooked them for approx. 40 min on a rack until dark brown & bacon was slightly crunchy. This let most of the fat drip off the bacon.. Gone in an instant..delicious!! Thanks!

This is a tremendous "meat candy" recipe! I like preheating the oven to 400, then turn down to 350 when I place them inside. This helps crispen a little better. I also agree with toothpicks and foil or parchment. The center-cut bacon works very well for less fat and a crisper product.

WOW!!!!
These were sooooo yummy!!!  I baked mine for 45 minutes, then broiled them for 1-2 minutes to get the bacon really crisp.  I did have to turn them and broil the other side as well.  But if you put them on skewers, it's pretty easy to do.  I also dredged the smokies and bacon in the brown sugar first.  I thought they would be really sweet, but they weren't.

I had to cook these for 45-55 min before bacon was crisp....brown sugar didn't "melt" as I imagined it would.  Kind of gaggy.  I would not make them like this again.

I made these for a Labor Day cookout, to munch on while we waited on the BBQ. And I must say that these were also a BIG HIT at my get-to-gether. I dont think they lasted 30 mins! Thanks for a great appetizer, and thanks to the others who reccommended  not to "skimp" on the brown sugar! I thought I might of been overdoing it a bit, but in the end, I realized its the ingredient that makes these WONDERFUL.

Super tasty but messy. Love the salty/sweet combo and the chewiness of the bacon and the stickiness of the brown sugar. Big hit in my house.

Absolutely delicious! The sweetness of the brown sugar balances the saltiness of the bacon. I simply put them in the oven for about 12 mins, poured the bacon fat then broiled it for a couple min. I'd definately make this recipe again.

Great appetizer! I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged the bacon in brown sugar before wrapping up the smokies. They turned out great and everyone loved them!

I don't care for bacon myself, but these were great!  I had great reviews from everyone at my New Years Party.  I cut the really fatty end off the bacon (about an inch or so), then cut the rest in thirds.  I pressed the bacon into a brown sugar and chili powder mix, then rolled, secured with tooth pic and baked.  I kept them warm in the crock pot while they lasted!

Delicious! Made these for New Year's Eve and everyone loved them. Didn't skewer or toothpick them, just put them seam-down on the foil-lined baking sheet. Needed to put them under the broiler for a while to really crisp up. My family couldn't eat enough! Thanks.

These were quite good!  I loved how the brown sugar created a good combination between salty and sweet.  The only thing is that they taste best out of the oven.

These were ok.  Made them for my SuperBowl party and while people liked them there were some leftover.  For me this was bordering a 4 and a 5, but in the end I went with a 4 due to the prep time.  Wrapping the bacon around each smokie was a bit time consuming.

Worth trying if you like smokies.

I made these for a baby shower yesterday and everybody loved them, they were very easy to make, not time consuming at all.  thumbs up and five stars all the way.  I now can add this receipe to my everybody loves collection.   I have to take the opinion of everyone that ate these because I am a vegetarian(spelling?) so I cant even test taste before I put them out.  I got great reviews and will make again.

Easy and delicious!!! It was a big hit. Maybe next time I'll try to add some maple syrup with the brown sugar for extra flavor. Two thumbs up!!!!

Someone I work with brought these for a get-together.  However, she had cut the bacon into thirds and wrapped it around the smokies, then secured each one with a toothpick instead of using a skewer.  Then, she placed them in the baking dish and poured the brown sugar on top of them, which sounds a little easier to me then all of this dredging.  I plan on making them for a Super Bowl party, where I know they'll go over well.  If not, guess I'll just have to eat them all!   :)

These are great.  My young grandsons adore them. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because these are rather greasy because the bacon does not get crispy.  Next time I may try cooking at a higher temperature to see if the bacon gets more done.  But, as along as you don't mind soft bacon, these are wonderful.

I enlisted my husband to help prepare these as we watched the Thanksgiving Day Parade on T.V.. Took them to his parents house in a crock pot, and everyone raved!  Will make again, probably for Superbowl Sunday.

Prepare to get your hands dirty and make a bit of a mess, but the end result is well worth it!  When I have served these, they have disappeared in a hurry.  Are they a healthful choice?  Not at all, but for a "sometime" treat, they are great.  I have used individual toothpicks, rather than skewers, and have prepared them ahead of time so the flavors can meld more.  And they do look a bit nasty before cooking them.  If I am taking them somewhere else, I just put them in a warmed crockpot and leave it on that setting when I plug it back in.  Again, they never last long enough for me to be able to tell you how long they will stay good in the crockpot.  As others have pointed out, you will want to line your pan with foil as this makes a big mess -- but it is worth the mess!  Thanks for this recipe!  It is a keeper!

GREAT BREAKFAST COMPANION. NEEDED TO CUT MOST OF FAT OFF OF BACON, DON'T LIKE MY BACON CHEWY AND CUT IN HALF WIDTH-WISE.  ALSO, USED BREAKFAST SAUSAGE LINKS INSTEAD OF LITTLE SMOKIES. VERY GOOD. WILL MAKE AGAIN.

Awesome!  Took these to a super bowl party and everyone wanted the recipe... then they couldn't believe there are only three ingredients!  I followed the recipe except I put each smokie on an individual toothpick that had been soaked in water.  YUM YUM

Neat recipe. I used thick sliced maple flavored bacon and dipped each bacon slice in brown sugar (both sides). It took a bit longer to cook and still wasn't overly crispy but the flavor was terrific.

Very good but a bit greasy.  I put mine on a paper towel to drain some of the grease.  Also good to dip them in some dijon mustard.

Fabulous!  I made these for a group of friends last weekend and they were an absolute hit!  How can you go wrong with pork fat, wrapped in pork fat, drenched in sugar?  They were wiped clean in about 10 minutes and I got tons of requests for the recipe.  This is definitely not a healthy recipe, but it's great for special occasions.

These were excellent.  Not exactly something that goes well with a diet, but great appetizer.  I usually just use one toothpick per smokie though...that way the bacon crisps up all the way around.

Wow. We made these as an appetizer for a wedding.  They were served in a chafing dish with a can of sterno underneath.  Some of the young adults took PLATES of these.  A Major Hit!!We are going to make them this Sunday for Easter dinner.  Five stars.

Excellent and easy to make!  I made this recipe for a holiday party and everyone loved them.  When asked for the recipe, my friends couldn't believe how easy they are to make.  I took reviewers' advice and marinated the smokies in the brown sugar overnight then sprinkled more brown sugar before baking.  I will make this recipe again.

Awesome!  Every flavor so good.  I cooked these the day before for about 15 minutes and then put more brown sugar on them and let them sit overnight.  My brother couldn't stop eating.  A new "Jill regular".

These were phenominal....followed the suggestions to marinate overnite and cook longer and they turned out great.  They went so quickly I didn't even get a chance to have more than one...SAVE A FEW for yourself!!

THIS WERE SOOOO GOOOOD!!  I ALSO PREPARED THE NIGHT BEFORE AND LET THE BROWN SUGAR SOAK IN BEFORE I BAKED.  THE FIRST BATCH I MADE I COULDN'T STOP EATING THEM, SO I HAD TO WRAP THEM UP AND GIVE TO MY PARENTS TO TRY.  THEY LOVED IT.  FOR MY DAUGHTER'S 5TH BIRTHDAY PARTY, I BOUGHT THE PARTY SIZE OF THE LITTLE SMOKIES.  THE GUESTS INCLUDING THE KIDS LOVED THEM AS WELL.  THANKS FOR THE DELICOUSLY EASY RECIPE!!!

These little apps were a hit with my family.  I made them for the 4th and everyone enjoyed the idea of little sausages wrapped with bacon.  They were a bit oily, but no one seemed to care. We stuck them on kabob skewers, but toothpicks would have been a good idea too. I used the non-stick foil and it worked great. Thanks for the idea Tina.

SINFUL!!! Be sure to coat the bacon and smokies well. Don't forget to crisp them under the broiler. Thank you for sharing!!!

Yummy!! Despite the fact that this is very messy, it is not that hard to make and taste great. It would make a great dish for a party,I served it with the down home macaroni and cheese ( also on this site)and it was great for a casual dinner.

I had to search for a long time to find little smokies - in my area, Pathmark is the only chain that carries them. But once if ound them, these were delicious! A little hard to keep the presentation looking professional, but who cares. =-)

VERY simple.  I make these the night before (cover & store in fridge).  Just toss in the oven before guests are due to arrive.  They'll be gobbled up.
