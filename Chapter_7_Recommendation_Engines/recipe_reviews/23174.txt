Perfect. I didn't use chervil because it's not something I normally have and I didn't want to go to the store, but next time I might spring for it to see what it's like. This soup is far better than the ever-popular Creamy Chicken & Wild Rice Soup from this site - and just as easy, in my opinion. I added about 2 cups of cooked, diced chicken to this because I made it for someone who needs a lot of protien in her diet - but it's also wonderful as is. Thanks!!

The flavor is marvelous.  I substituted 1 1/2 cup of 1% milk and 1/2 cup half-and-half, and the soup still came out rich and creamy.  There is no amount of water given for the wild rice; I followed the directions on the box.  Instead of 20 min for the rice, my box said 50 so I let it cook longer.

This would be good with some chicken added to it. Next time I will do that and also cut back on the butter. I used a fat free half and half since it was what I had on hand. That may have given a slightly less creamy texture. Nothing is better in the fat free version! lol! Next time I will also cut the amount of curry in half and use chicken stock instead of vegetable. Good recipe though!

I had problems with this. 1st, the sherry was way to overpowering. and I found it flavorless so i doubled all the spices and we still couldn't taste the curry. it was not hot and spicy at all. it was a good soup but not at all what I was expecting based on others reviews. I would make it again without the sherry.

I added carrots and cabbage since I didn't have enough cabbage.  Using whole wheat flour, i made the roux with the veggies using soy milk.  It was strange to strongly smell the sherry, but taste the spicy herbs!  It is a satisfying soup.

I did throw in some cooked chicken and used chicken broth rather than vegetable.  My husband said he would have liked this better if it had been creamier.  Thought the broth was a bit lite.

Very good soup.  Has a bit of a bite to it.  I don't have half and half, so it was probably more soupy than creamy for me.  (I used 1 cup of milk instead of 2 cups of half and half).  However, still nice and flavorful.  Bf liked it well enough but said something was missing.  What, I don't know, bc he told me "you never make anything twice, so what do you care?"  I guess I've been making too many different things.  Oh, well. Onward, more AR recipes to try!  If I do come back to this, maybe add some chicken and more veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Supurb!  I incresed the porpotion of broth, and decreased the cream, and it was silky & delicious.  Also used lemon juice instead of sherry and added shredded, cooked chicken.  Perfect for the cold weather.

DELICIOUS!  I didn't have chervil (and couldn't find it on Safeway.com : ), but this was still wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!! Didn't add as much curry but did add a little garlic.  My whole family loved it - even my boyfriend. Will definitely make this again!

Yummy! I used a sweet curry and thought it needed more flavor,  so I doubled the curry and mustard. I'll make it again.

I made this soup and thought it was wonderful   I did tweak it a bit. I didn’t use 2 cups of half and half, I used 1 cup and one cup of 1% milk.  I also used more curry powder.  I had a jar of a special blend of hot curry powder and used 1 teaspoon of that.

I used parsley in place of chervil because I read that they’re similar in flavor. This is a good soup for chilly weather.

What an elegant and easy soup.  Every guest requested the recipe. The only change I made was to use  amontillado sherry since I did not have any dry - and do use all 2/3 of a cup. If you like any kind of mushroom soup, try this recipe with or without the rice and with multiple mushrooms.  You will not be disappointed.

This is a really rich and filling recipe which uses wild rice, mushrooms, broth, and a variety of seasonings adding a full spectrum of flavor. The only thing I left out was the chervil because I didn’t have any. You add half-and-half for that creamy element.

This was absolutely lovely. I would go easy on the pepper, however, and make sure it gets well stirred in, because I got a nasty mouthful of it!
