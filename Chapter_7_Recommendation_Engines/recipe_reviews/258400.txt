I really liked this but it needs a little something to take it over the top, perhaps diced tomatoes instead of crushed and a generous pinch of red pepper flakes. I couldn't find duck fat so I made a simple garlic bread to go with the mussels. This was served with a simple spinach salad. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
