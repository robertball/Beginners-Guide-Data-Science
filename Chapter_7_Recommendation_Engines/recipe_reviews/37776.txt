Made these for lunch today = very good! I used miracle whip instead of mayo, which gives it more of a kick.  Also, I used smaller buns (I think they're called "silver dollar buns?") which allowed me to make smaller servings but more of them. Finally, when they were done, I removed the top and added in a slice of lettuce. Very good. Served with "Oven Fries" from this site and was a very good lunch! These would be a perfect way to use up leftover turkey. Thanks Kraft!

Very good sandwich...I did omit the onions and reduce the amount of mustard to suit our personal tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really good as directed in the recipe, but I'm going to add some salt next time -- maybe garlic salt.  There will definitely be a next time though!

Not really as the real Turkey sandwiches, but coming close. Only messy to make.

Texture and taste both change when heated for 15 minutes (because cold it didn't taste as good)! The pickles 'make' this recipe. I put on lo-carb hoagie rolls. Yum.

Excellent recipe!!!  Both times I made this recipe I used leftover grilled chicken breasts instead of turkey.  I used fresh French rolls from the deli and have gotten rave reviews!  Yes... the pickles make this recipe although the vadalia (sweet) onion made the sandwich taste better too.  Next time I will try tuna, but I definitely love this recipe.  Easy to make and tastes great!

Fast, easy and good. You can change this up to suit your own tastes (I add garlic powder). Thank you.

This is easy and fast.  My family is not big on eating onions so I just didn't put them on, and we used sliced cheese instead of shredded.

Simple, great tasting recipe. I make this with chicken breast instead of turkey and without the pickels. Works good for lunches. Yummy!
