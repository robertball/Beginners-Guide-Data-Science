This recipe is now in my keeper file.  We added a very small pinch of Cumino at the point of boiling. It adds a definite zip to the recipe. Since we prefer eat this type of meal in soft tortillas we reduced the diced tomatoes by half and drained the juice.  If saturated fat is a concern I recommend refrigerating for one night and skimming off the fat....

This was a great flavour.
I added a couple of things though, in my opinion, enhanced the flavour even more so.
Added 3 cloves garlic and 1 half of a lime( rind and all). Let it all cook together.
the lime added such an amazing flavour to the dish, I couldnt imagine it without it.
Thanks for the recipe. Definetely a keeper!

I took the original posters lead and actually made this using verde salsa - one medium and one hot.  I also reduced the cans of tomatoes and chili to one but kept the juice.  A bit of cumino as it all came to a boil in the final phase.  All I can say is, "Wow!!"  Even better than what I've had in a local restaurant.  Easy cleanup too.  Thanks for the hints and the recipe.

This was pretty good although my family decided that it needed more kick. I added some cayenne and salt at the end of cooking and will use hot salsa next time. I also refuse to cook anything in a plastic bag -- that cannot be healthy. I cooked everything in a crockpot. I would probably make it again with modifications.

Very good! We had it one night with tortillas, eaten like a soup, and the next night served over rice, eaten with tortilla chips and sour cream. Both ways were delicious.

My guests said this dish was delicious. I had eight people for dinner, so made the recipe to serve 8. It would have served 12-16 depending on appetites. I don't have a crock pot, so I used my electric roaster...I put everything in the cooking bag, sat the whole thing into the roaster and surrounded it with water. Cooked at between 225 and 250 degrees. It came out moist, fork tender and delicious. I let guests spoon it up into whole wheat tortillas, and served with a salad. Quick, easy, delicious. Just what we needed on a very busy day of taking guests sightseeing. When we returned home all I needed to do was make the salad.

This recipe is incredible.  I love using the slow cooker, because it is so easy and this recipe is no different.  I have used this multiple times and it will be a staple in my menu.  It is the best for using a shoulder roast.  Since there are just two of us, I freeze some of the pork for easy future meals.  Thanks for this awesome recipe. I have given it to many family and friends.  I highly recommend it!!  Thanks.

UPDATE: Had leftovers today and they were very yummy! I was worried that the meat would dry out, but it didn't. My bf had leftovers (eaten spooned over tortilla chips - with all the fixins) and also enjoyed it (and he HATES leftovers - lol). Very good! I was skeptical at first... my roast, when taken out of the slow cooker, had a lot of fat on it (which grosses me out!). After I shredded the meat, it was perfect! I followed the directions to a T, except for halving the recipe for my bf and I (I have lots of leftovers for tomorrow and the weekend, even after me having two servings and my bf having 4!!!). Served with soft corn tortillas, shredded lettuce and cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes, fresh lime and sour cream. Next time, I'll prepare with green salsa or either top each helping with some. This goes particularly well with Spanish rice. Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe!

So simple and very good.  Unlike some Mexican dishes I've made in the slow cooker, the flavor of this one lived up to the smell.

Sooooo GOOOOOOD! Fantastic! Has good flavor and spice! I just threw everything in the crock pot together...didn't mess with the bag and the water or the dutch oven. I used one big 24  oz jar of salsa so it wasn't the full amount but it still turned out great...and probably better bc the recipe doesn't need anymore liquid. I added some garlic salt and fajita seasoning towards the end. Awesome recipe!

I made a real classic bonehead move with this recipe but happy to now report that it's a recipe that is foolproof! I jumped the gun and put the pork, rotel, salsa, chili powder, onions and water into the crock pot and THEN read the directions a little closer and saw the whole bag set up. OOPS. Since it was too late to undo, I just hoped for the best. I cooked on low for six hours, shredded the pork and put back into the sauce for a little longer. It was dynamite in soft tacos and on nachos. Using all that water made it a little watery and we had to drain quite a bit. But it was delicious once we did that. So the next time I made this, I did the same thing (skipped the bag). It's simple this way and I used just 3/4 c water. After doing this, I think you could probably skip the water altogether and use only the salsa and rotel. Like I said: foolproof recipe and excellent taste! My 10 year old son and his friend called them "the best tacos they'd EVER eaten."

Added cumin. Didn't do bag or water. Just put everything in the crock pot and the meat was so tender.  Served as shredded pork tacos w/ warm corn tortillas and garnished with cilantro, cojita cheese, and radish slices. Very authentic in flavor and super easy to make.

I used this as a basic recipe and improvised on it. I did not add any water to to mine and only used a half of one jar of salsa. I added one can of diced tomatoes in sauce,an extra small can of diced green chiles, a small can of tomato sauce, half a bottle of Chipotle sauce (by the Tabasco), the juice of one whole lime, lime zest from half a lime, 3 jalapeno peppers (but only one with the seeds and membranes)and a cup of chopped cilantro. I cooked it on low all day in my slow cooker and the pork shredded perfectly. I served this over rice and black beans and topped with shredded colby/jack cheese, sour cream and sliced avocados. It was fantastic!

This was very good but it needed something in my opinion. Not really sure what though! My only mistake was not taking enough fat off of the pork before cooking it so definitely make sure to cut all the fat off.

This recipe was great! I didn't use a bag because I didn't have one, I just put everything in a crockpot together and then followed the recipe later.  I will cook this meal again!  Great with refried beans.

Made this today for a party and it was excellent.  I made a few changes to it.  First, I rubbed the pork with a combination of Ancho, and New Mexico chili powder. Second, instead of water in the slow cooker, I used beer.  I used drained diced tomatoes and added hatch chilis seperatly. Finally during the final cooking, I added cumin and stuck a whole ancho dried chili in to add some more flavor.  As someone else said, fresh lime squeezed over it when you serve it is a must.

Wasn't anything special. Definitely needed salt. The spices did not do anything special for me and did not flavor entire roast, only exterior crust. The salsa was the only special quality.

The pork broke down more than I would have liked, so next time I will cook it shorter.  Also, I would add a can of chilies.

This was really good, my hungry firefighter husband just gobbled it up!  I also cut back on the salsa, and I cooked it longer than an hour on the stove to get more liquid cooked out, but it was delicious!

Excellent Taste & Easy Preparation.  Used 3.5 lb bone-in pork shoulder roast, 3 tbsp chile powder, 2 tsp Hawaiian Sea Salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp cumin. Cooked in the crock pot for 8 hours.  I got home from work and put the roast in the dutch oven, shredded it, added 1 can tomatoes with chiles, 1 16 oz jar of ChiChi's original salsa, and a few ladles of liquid from the crock pot, and then let simmer for a 1/2 hour.  Served with refried beans and tortilla chips, my wife & I loved it.

I thought it lacked flavor. I made it as directed. When I found there wasn't much flavor I added cumin, carne asada seasoning, salt, & garlic powder. Later I added some enchilada sauce and that improved the flavor. I think it would be better to nix the bag and the water, add the extra seasonings and the enchilada sauce and cook it in the crock pot.

My father makes a similar chili although we keep it green.  We actually used to roast the chilies when we were kids over the stove on skewers while he prepared the other ingredients. For an added flavor try adding cilantro, lime and orange juice to the recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe! I added a little cumin to the mix at the end, and also added some leftover canned black beans that I had in the refridgerator. It made plenty of food for the two of us. We had it as a soup the first night, with tortilla chips and some sour cream on top. We had it as taco's in some flour tortillas a couple nights later.   I only cooked the pork in the slow cooker for the 6 hours, but next time I will cook it for 8 hours since the pork was a little tough to shred. Truly delicious! I love Mexican food, and this recipe was the best I've made in a while!

Geez, I hate to be the only one not giving this a stellar rating, but in my opinion this was totally mediocre.  It was by no means bad, but was no different in taste that just putting warmed salsa over a decent boston butt.  There was nothing complex about the flavors and the meat was no more tender nor delicious than an other cooking method I've tried. ...And with having several more steps before sitting down to eat(cockpot, shred meat, simmer in dutch oven, etc.), I just wasn't impressed.  Sorry everyone, I just expected more.

I've made this twice now and have enjoyed it both times.  I used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (after running the peppers through the mini food processor).  They really added the extra kick I was looking for.  The pork was great on corn tortillas and then I made enchiladas with mole sauce out of the rest.

We loved this recipe! Very easy to make and has a wonderful flavor. We substituted some of the water for chicken broth. We ate like a stew the first night and the night day made tacos out of it. This recipe is a keeper!

Awesome recipe and so easy.  Great for freezing in small portions to serve with lightly cooked corn tortillas.  My husband thought he was in El Paso again :)  Will make over and over as is.

My family was throughly enjoyed this dish. I served with flour and corn tortillas. My fave was the corn, my husband preferred the flour. I also added a can of black olives to the rojo as it was simmering. Otherwise I followed this recipe to the letter

Thank you so much for sharing!!

This was SO YUMMY and exactly what I was looking for. I just threw everything in the crockpot....much easier!

Also, I used one jar of green salsa and one jar of red. It made a TON of extra sauce so I stuck it in the freezer for later :)

I listened to other reviews and used only one jar of salsa. Other than that, I followed the recipe and the result was delicious! We served this on tortillas like a burrito or taco: messy, but tasty!

I tried this recipe with some reservations about the salsa and I was right it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for I may try it again using home made chili sauce instead the kids ate some but not much and my husband ate some as well but no one really commented on it which means it was not all that great.

Great recipe.  I found that by using pork chops it cooked a lot faster.  Just cook then cut the pork into small pieces.  Next time I'll cook with the salsa a litle longer so it won't be so watery.  I premade burriotos with this and cheese.  They were gone in no time.  An easy after school/work snack.  It was great!

Made it for the first time today and it was excellent my family really enjoyed it. I also think this could serve as one heck of a base for a lot of improvisations.

I diverged from the recipe in the following ways: I put all the juice from the bag in. I think that made it too liquid unless you strain it at serving time. I think next time I'll try removing the liquid from the tomatoes and use all the juice from the meat. I didn't use a Dutch oven, I put all the ingredients back into the slow cooker while I shredded the beef, brought it to boiling on high and then let it go for an hour on low. I also threw in a small can of green chili peppers since I was using Pace mild salsa. Even with them added I still got compliments from the pepper sensitive folks I have to feed.

Added about double curry and extra cayenne for a little kick, left it thick instead of adding much water and it was perfect in 3 hours because we don't like our carrots mushy so we left them al dente - delicious!

Loved this recipe! I cooked the whole meal right in the crockpot sans plastic bag, and took another user's suggestion and added a whole lime, just sliced in half and threw it in the pot, and some roughly chopped garlic - I stabbed holes in the meat and stuffed with the garlic, and threw the extra into the pot. I also added a tsp or so of ground dried fiery chili pepper mix that I had on hand, and cut the salsa and canned tomatoes in half since I thought it would be a little too soupy.

I made this out of leftover pork roast that had cooked with saukraut for New Years Day. All I had was pico de gallo, which already contains onions, tomatoes and jalapeno peppers. It turned the dried-out pork into a tasty, moist dinner. Since we are currently eating low-carb, I served it with "rice" I made by steaming cauliflower after putting it through the shredding blade on my food processor. My husband and I loved it!

Very good.  I added cumin and marjoram, teaspoon of each for an additional touch 10 oz of chirizo.   Three white potatos were cooked earlier and added the last 5 minutes while simmering.

This recipe was very tasty.  I changed it up a bit so that it was more like carnitas.  I only added 1 jar of green salsa & 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (hot).  I served it with spanish rice the first night and made carnita burritos with it the second night.  Delicious!

Tried this recipe four days ago. My husband could NOT stop raving about it!!!! He said it was BY FAR the best thing I had made.  The only change I made was I cooked the whole thing in a slowcooker and halved the water. A definate must have recipe!!!!

I had planned to rate this a 3, as it seemed a bit bland to me. But the reheated leftovers were so much better I had to give it another star. This was a solid meal. I'm going to experiment a bit with some more spices, but will definitely make again.

We made this and it was spicy and delicous...there are only 2 of us and it tasted just as good the last day as the first, if not better!

I also add garlic, which I do to most meat dishes.  My kids insist on this when they visit and i, who really dislikes cooking, do not mind this simple all day recipe.

This was amazing! I reduced the quantity to serve 2, and decided to cook it in my instant pot. I cooked it for 30 minutes and used a 15 natural pressure release. The pork was fork tender! I found I had too much liquid for my preference, but this is a solid recipe!

Doesn't taste like your typical crock pot recipe. I also added garlic to the oven bag and then used the diced tomatoes with habaneros to add some extra spice.

Followed recipe as written.  I say 3 stars and BF says 5 stars.  I thought it was good but not great... I don't know...I just wish it had more flavor.  I wouldn't make it again unless my BF asks for it.

DANG this is awesome.

I rubbed the roast in the spices and soaked the whole roast overnight in the fridge (if you do this, cover it well or it will stink up the place).

It was SO DELICIOUS, made it c my homemade chipotle lime rice.  My boyfriend ate it for 4 days with NO complaints. 

THANK YOU!

Easy and Excellent! This took about 2 hours (before final hour with sauces) to cook in a pressure cooker. Excellent taste. I will serve tomorrow for company, hopefully they will enjoy as much as me.
