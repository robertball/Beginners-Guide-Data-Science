Yummy!  This was a huge hit.   Everyone loved it - the fruit chunks in the drink really make it unique.  A definite keeper!

Great recipe. I used club soda for a lighter drink. Also used Pinot Grigio which worked well. Got lots of compliments.

Delicious! I don't like peach-based white sangrias so this was a great option! I used sliced pineapples in juice instead for less pulp. I made this the night before and added everything except for the oranges and limes because the rind can add a bitter flavor after a while. Everyone loved it!

This was so delicious.  I tripled the recipe and left out the lemon lime soda.  I added some frozen mangos to it.  There was nothing left to this.  Beware, it's very easy to go down...and it's got a kick!

This was wonderful.  I tried it once and thought it was okay, I used a Moscato and no soda and I left the peels on all the fruit (except pineapple of course).  I found this to be a bit bitter, I blame the fruit peels on that one.           I made it again and added another 6 ozs of frozen lemonade and kept the pineapple juice out (I had no cans of pineapple or pineapple juice): I used fresh cut pineapple that I crushed a little, an apple, a lime (peeled), and two Clementine (peeled), again I used Moscato and no soda.  This time it was amazing.  I think that my first try with this would have been good if I had not left the peels on the fruit.

delicious!   you could cut back on the fruit.   I used lemon lime flavored seltzer,  so no additional sugar and it was perfect.

Yum! I used Pinot Grigio and stole an idea from another white sangria recipe by freezing the grapes ahead of time, then using some of them in place of ice cubes. Because some reviewers said this recipe is very sweet, I substituted club soda for the lemon-lime soda. The pineapple juice and frozen lemonade concentrate make it plenty sweet. So refreshing!

This was great.  We served it yesterday for a warm-weather get-together and everyone went back for seconds.  It was very light and refreshing. We substituted sauvignon blanc for the Chardonnay but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  We were asked for the recipe by several guests.

This was delicious and so refreshing.  The thing that was great is that everyone likes it - both sweet and dry wine drinkers!  You can vary the sweetness a little by varying the amount of 7-Up you add.

I used Sailor Jerry rum and a Chardonnay. It was very sweet but had a great flavor. Almost a little too sweet!

Once you bring this sangria the family will want you to bring it for ALL the gatherings. Be careful what you start.
It is my favorite Sangria so far. It came out good with apricot brandy instead of triple sec. Also good with puree of strawberries to make it colorful. Thank you for sharing, Mimi.

A big hit at a summer party. I also used club soda then added just a few teaspoons of sugar for a perfect balance of sweetness.
