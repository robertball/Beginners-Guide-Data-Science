Although American butchers may label a cut of meat "London broil", the term does not refer to a specific cut of meat but to a method of preparation and cookery. The cut of meat traditionally used is flank steak, but butchers may label top round steak or roast as London broil.

Great tender, fall-apart roast. The gravy is truly the gem of this recipe--it is the perfect thickness packed full of flavor. Instead of wine I used sherry because it was what I had on hand. Next time I might add a bay leaf or some thyme to add herbal depth, but really this needs no modifications. DELISH & very easy.

Sorry, I changed it up some but I did use this method to cook it. I used what I had on hand rather than making a trip to the store. I did not have beef broth or red wine. I used a 3# London broil, white wine and half a packet of onion soup mix. I did use the creole seasoning and also some garlic pepper seasoning. I did not use carrots or potatoes but did use about 4 oz of sliced mushrooms that needed to be cooked. I also used the golden mushroom soup. I have not eaten it yet but have tasted and it is very good in flavor. I will serve this over mashed potatoes.

I always liked pot roast but had London Broil in the freezer and used this recipe. I don't think I will go back to pot roast again. Did not have creole seasoning so I used Cajun. Making it for 14 people tomorrow !

Went downtown for a chuck roast to cook in the crock pot, and came back with a couple of London Broils since they were on sale. Found and followed this recipe of Johnny's along with making the homemade Creole seasoning.  I did use at least 3 TABLESPOONS, instead of a teaspoon,  (must be a typo), of the seasoning that was to my taste.

The meat, veggies, and gravy all turned out spicy and flavorful without the fatty grease. 

I cooked it 5.5 hours on high, and the potatoes were done a couple of hours before the rest of the meal. Will hold them out for a few hours on my next cook. But this is a keeper!

Making a London Broil like this was awesome! The only thing I did different was use Red Cooking Wine. I sliced up the meat and we ate it rolled up in tortillas.

Made just like the recipe...  Brown onion Gravy is great! Lots of hot home made dinner rolls to slop it up with...YUM! ... Comfort food junkie!    London Broil may not be the perfect choice for this recipe but still we enjoyed the flavor and vegs that went along with it. Might try it again with stew meat. This one does has promise!

This was good. Less fat and grease than a chuck roast that's for sure. I used red cooking wine and I had Cajun seasoning so I used that in place of the Creole and added paprika. I never thought to add seasonings like that before but it actually was tasty!

Made this yesterday for Sunday dinner.  The only thing I did differently was added mushrooms (a must have with this kind of meal!) to the the crockpot with the other veggies.  This was delicious!  Turned out perfect!  Made some homemade bread to go along and enjoyed the look on my husbands face with each bite.  Easy to prepare and love not having to stand over a stove to get this kind of result.  Definitely a keeper in my house! Thank you Johnny!

Made this today but thought it was a bit too spicy hot. Good flavor but just too peppery hot. May try again but with half the amounts listed for the Creole seasoning. Even son, who loves spicy hot foods, said it was too peppery.

This recipe makes a delicious dish!  It's easy to follow and doesn't take long.  The end result is tender beef and gravy with all of the vegetables needed for a good meal, although  I served it along with fresh green beans.   I am sensitive to milk, so I  made a cream of mushroom soup "substitute" using almond milk, flour, water, and sliced mushrooms. (See recipes on godairyfree.com)  I didn't have creole seasonings, so I made my own using the tips listed under the recipe.  Now, I have extra creole seasoning left to use at a later time.  I also used a 1.5 piece of London broil, because that is what I had in the refrigerator, and it was actually a better fit in my crock pot.

This is one of those surprisingly easy recipes that yields crowd-pleasing results. I buy stew meat, shake it in a bag with flour, s&p, and the Creole seasoning, and sear it. Otherwise, I follow all directions as listed and serve with rosemary bread and a simple side salad of arugula with sliced pears, Parmesan, s&p, and olive/lemon juice to taste. Perfecr chilly day meal.

8/2019 - followed recipe and used a bbq seasoning instead of creole (didn't have) - used a small amount of carrots and lots of potatoes.  This was just ok, lacked much flavor and the leftovers weren't appealing.

Made it several times cooked on both low and high depending on time available. Used whatever decent wine was already open, not necessarily red, and use sweet potatoes (low glycemic). Even "screwed up" last time by not combining and pre-cooking the liquids before adding to the cooker pot. Totally awesome meal. I use organic, grass fed london broil; I think organic meat, though costlier, tastes better.

Very forgiving recipe.  Didn't have cream of mushroom but had golden mushroom soup. Didn't have carrots but did add some fresh mushrooms.   I just sprinkled on Tony's creole seasoning on the London broil pieces as they were browning in the oil. Got a nice brown on them before adding to the slow cooker.  Used 2 1/2 cups beef broth and deglazed the pan with the broth and soup.  Meat is just falling apart beautifully and the potatoes have soaked up some of the soup and broth sauce.  This will be a new favorite-thank you!  The type of creole seasoning and its freshness will affect the spicy level of the final dish.

Food enthusiasts will be quick to tell you that London broil is not a cut of beef, but a cooking method. Tough pieces of meat—commonly, flank or top round steak—are left to marinate overnight, are then broiled under high heat and served by thinly slicing the meat “across the grain

This was so easy and delicious. After returning from shopping, the aroma that had fiilled the house while I was gone let me know I was in for something good. Pretty much made as is except for adding bay leaves, adding fresh mushrooms and cooking potatoes separately. You'll want to take shots of the sauce.

Excellent recipe! I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added  2 cups of baby portabella mushrooms during the last hour. Much to my surprise, the London broil was very tender and not dry at all. Just make sure you cut the meat into 3 or 4 pieces before searing.

This was very good, but nothing special.  I did not use all the spices because this was a marinated london broil that had been frozen.

Nice flavor; however every time I've made this with the London Broil cut it is not fall apart. It is actually a bit tough like some of the other reviewers have said. Maybe it's just because of the store I purchase the cut from. I would recommend marinating and grilled this type of cut. There are some AMAZING recipes on here for that. Makes a good gravy. Served it with peas, potatoes, carrots and biscuits.

Great recipe! I never thought to use Creole seasoning and it was a perfect compliment to the meat. I did make a few adjustments based on what I had; actually made this in the oven with my Dutch oven as I didn't have time to use slow cooker. If you cook it this way, try 325 degrees for about 2 hours. And you jaw ton reduce the amount of liquid a bit so the gravy doesn't become soupy. I coated the meat in creole seasoning and flour, browned all sides. I minced the onion as my family doesn't like big slices of onion, put veggies on the bottom so the juices we all nicely infused while cooking. Added two teaspoons minced garlic, a dab of liquid smoke and a bay leaf on top but otherwise followed recipe as written. Served it with corn bread and it was great! Will be using this again soon :)

Great basic pot roast recipe with London broil in the slow cooker!  I was a bit heavy handed with the wine...  and added some celery to the veggies.  Adding fresh mushrooms works great too.  I'll be making this again!

I had a smaller piece of meat so I cooked it for 5 hrs on high and it feel apart and was fantstic.  I could have shortened the cooking time, the gravy was just right!

Went a little heavier on the red wine, about 3/4 of a cup, and was great. Used cajun seasoning, which was good, but will add some paprika next time to spice it up a little more. Once it's ready, sprinkle some Crazy's Jane's mixed up salt and cracked black pepper on it.

I thought this was a really tasty dish.  Even when made with cheap red wine, the flavor of the wine came through nicely.  It was easy to make and browning the meat heavily during prep also enhanced the flavor.  I will definitely try this again!

Made this yesterday for my family and they devoured it, this is a keeper! We love the creole seasoning for a change.  I did add  extra 1/2 of  all the gravy ingredients (wine, soup & broth).

London Broil tends to go on sale a lot here, so I looked up a recipe for one of these in the slow cooker and this one did not disappoint!!  The creole seasoning was wonderful and translated perfectly into the gravy.   This is a great way to make a cheap cut of meat taste fantastic.  Also, I loved how the potatoes soaked up all the flavor from the meat and the gravy.  So good!

I just added the ingredients to the Slow Cooker. We'll see how this turns out!  And for the cream of mushroom soup, I didn't feel like going to the store, so I made it from scratch.

I didn't like this very much. I found it to be very bland and very dry. I won't be making this again.

This recipe tastes good, but actually is very much like pot roast.
