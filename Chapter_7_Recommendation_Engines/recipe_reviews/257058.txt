It works, its good but not the best texture. I will try again and probably again and review if texture improves

3.2.17  I followed the recipe to the letter, perhaps cutting a little  too deeply into the top.  It certainly is easy and quick with no rising time involved, but it was a bit of a disappointment to me.  Honestly, I’ve never had brown soda bread before and I’m giving this recipe an additional star based solely on that, but I simply wasn’t crazy about either the taste or the texture,.  Wish I could give a better review and I don't want to discourage others from trying this recipe, but doubtful I’ll make this one again.
