As the submitter of this simple but fun cupcake idea, I have to say there seems to be one typo and that is, you will need about one tablespoon of sprinkles per cupcake, not just one tablespoon total. So if you're low on sprinkles, get more before you start, lol. I find the cupcakes fill easily, but if you want to make it really easy, carve out a small section of the center first. The topping will cover the hole. If you aren't into so much chocolate, use any combination of cake and pudding flavors to suit. Enjoy.

What a wonderful cupcake!  I made these this afternoon with my little guy and we had a blast.  The creamy filling/frosting is absolutely delicious and I definitely will be using it for other cupcakes as well.  Thanks for sharing this cute, easy and fun cupcake!

These were definately a hit with my family and kiddos. Made a Duncan Hines devils food cake and for the frosting, I used sugar free/fat free chocolate pudding, skim milk and fat free whipped topping. Delicious and light! Kiddos decorated them with the chocolate sprinkles and Cadbury mini candy coated eggs. Thanks!

idea and appearance for sure gets a 5 - - taste is a 3, so i will round out a 4.  boxed cake mix and pudding do not make a great cupcake imho.... i made it for the kids for our easter dessert table and they all seemed to enjoy them.  however i have several leftover that i fear will get tossed, as the taste is just not worth the calories!  if i were to make this recipe again, it would be with a homemade cake and frosting recipe, and just borrowing the idea for the birds nest.  all in all though, they make a great presentation and are very easy to make.  thanks for posting this great idea!

I used the birds nest idea for fun. I didn't turn out how I had planned, but overall a great idea!

I used jelly beans, and the bird's nests didn't really work out for me, but they tasted great. I just whipped cream, and it was a wonderful idea to combine that and pudding for a unique frosting!
