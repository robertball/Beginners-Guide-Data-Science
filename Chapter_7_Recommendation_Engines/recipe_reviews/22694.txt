My sister's catering company has made these for lots of social event and we've found they come out better if you bake them at 400 for a little longer than broiling them. They cook a little more evenly.  They are always a hit at parties.

I had these appetizers at a catered X-mas party this year, and they were awesome! I had to try and make them myself. A tip from the chef at the party was to use good, thick bacon from the deli (not the prepackaged stuff); I tried a little of each type of bacon (just to see) and he was definitely right-the thicker bacon works much better, and I only used about 1/3 of a strip on each date-they were great!

Amazing!  I collected recipes during the year to make for Christmas 2001.  I had an open house for several days and needed prepare-ahead recipes that I could pop in the oven or in the fryer as my guests arrived.  My first batch of dates I tried as the recipe called for, in the oven.  Cooking by this method made the bacon unevenly cooked.  My husbad tried one and didn't care for the sweetness of the date.  I almost chucked the whole heap of bacon wrapped dates and called it "a lesson learned".  The next day I had the wok with hot oil cooking crab puffs and I decided to try deep frying a batch of the dates.  It made a HUGE difference in the flavor and texture of the dates!  My husband thought they were delicious now!  They were no longer super sweet and the bacon was cooked evenly.  I asked my closest friends to rate the appetizers from most favorite to least (I had at least a dozen to choose from) and these were number one with most of my fussy eaters.  They're one of the best for making ahead and keeping in the fridge until ready to cook. I used a can of Diamond-A toasted and salted almonds.  Because the almonds were so small, I was able to stuff two into each date.  I will keep this recipe and make again.  They're wonderful.

Great!  I stuffed the dates a week ahead and left them in the fridge.  I used 2 different kinds of dates.  I recommend the ones found in the produce section, instead of the boxed and vaccuum sealed dates.  Those in produce had a hole where the almond easily slid right in, taking little time to assemble.  I also decided to roll the dates in BBQ sauce before wrapping with 1/3 slice of bacon.  These were a huge hit!  I will make them often.

These were a HUGE hit at a party I had this weekend, even among people who don't like dates. Like others, I baked these (intead of broiling) at 400* until browned. I'd suggest covering the cookie sheet in foil first- my pan was a bear to clean!

Made these for a holiday party and they were the big hit! VERY easy. I also baked in the oven for about 25 minutes. I used regular Hormel bacon and cut the strips into thirds before wrapping around the date. No toothpicks needed! Also prepped these in advance and just popped them in the oven as they were being ate!

These are excellent with or without using almonds.  A little hard to get the toothpick through when you use almonds, I find it easiest to weave the toothpick in & out of the seam where the bacon closes & not to try & attempt to skewer them on.

Been making samples of different appetizers for my annual Xmas Open House and this one will definitely be there! I tried baking a few at 400 degrees, but took too long. So I deep fried (peanut oil) at 350 degrees for a couple minutes. Absolutely fantastic. I used the Blue Diamond Roasted Salted Almonds and wrapped dates in 1/2 slice of bacon.

My sister in law had these at a fancy lunch one day and commented on how good they were.  I was in shock when I came across these. I can't wait to make these for my next get together.  Cooking them in the microwave does allow you to soak up the access grease with a paper towel, but frying them lends a flavor you can't get in the broiler or microwave.  I'm not sure how pecans would taste in these (another reviewer commented on it), so I'll just stick to the almonds.  Lots of thanks Cinn!!!

Like another reviewer, I am trying new recipes from this site for my Christmas open house. This was great with a sliver of water chestnut inside the date. (I didn't have any almonds). I think my guests may have it both ways!

I have been making these apps for years.  Always delish!! A nice variation is to skip the almonds and after wrapping the date, roll in a small bowl of brown sugar with a few shakes of cayenne pepper mixed in.  It gives a slight kick and is even more yummy.  Also quicker to do, since the almond in the middle interfers with sticking the tootpick through.  Be sure to bake with this method, not broil because the sugar will burn too quickly in the broiler.

what an awesome recipe, they taste like candy. Where have I been, I've never even heard of them? This is something you can assemble ahead - wrap and chill in the fridge for a party.  I lined the baking sheet with foil, used thick sliced bacon and salted almonds. I baked @ 400 for 17+ min (watch carefully-they are easy to over cook), with no toothpick(make sure to slightly overlap bacon so they won't unroll, if you aren't using toothpicks), added the toothpicks while cooling. The recipe is simple and crowd pleasing. They aren't the prettiest appetizer I've ever made, some even thought they looked unappetizing- but have anyone to try them- even if they don't like dates, and they will LOVE them.

These are pretty darn tasty!  I used the black label bacon, and it was nice, but next time I'm getting the thicker cut stuff from the meat counter.  One of the guys at the dinner came late, after everyone else had tried them (and loved them).  He was looking at them suspiciously, and was enthusiastically talked into "doing the date."  His comment?  "Oh, there WILL be a second date."

Served this at my cookie exchange to rave reviews!  The balance of smokey, salty and sweet are perfect for an appetizer(it covers ALL the bases!). I used 1/2 piece thick sliced bacon and was perfect.  I also baked at 400 for approximately 20 minutes, turning 1/2 way through.  These wraps are good when hot, but I think even better after cooled a bit.  An easy one to make ahead of time (plus the house smelled really yummy from the aroma!). Had friends call for recipe afterwards!

I adore dates, bacon, and almonds - but I am sorry to say that I hated this combination.  I fried it in peanut oil as suggested in several reviews, and found that frying obliterated the delicate taste of the medjool dates as well as the almonds. A far tastier and easier appetizer is pitted medjool dates, halved and  stuffed with chevre (goat cheese)and topped with a toasted pecan or walnut.

Bake for 400 for 20.  I used thick bacon cut in thirds, no tooth pics.  I put a variety of things in them:
cream cheese/ jalapenos
cream cheese/ whole almond
cream cheese/ jalapeno and kalmata olives
whole almond only
cream cheese/ slivered almonds/jalapenos

And maybe more ... they were all great!

I made these this weekend, and they were awesome! I used thick-cut bacon and baked them at 400 for about 20 minute, I think. Also, I pressed some brown sugar on the bottom of the pyrex dish before placing the dates in it and also sprinkled a little bit on top of them. It made a really great combo with the bacon. I also made half without almonds and were just as good, if not better. They were definitely a hit!

We make these regularly and also have them at a local Cuban restaurant as an appetizer.  At Havana Cafe in Phoenix, az, they stuff the date with a little lsice of SPANISH Chorizo. (NOT mexican ground up chorizo-there is a huge diference).  These are a huge hit whenever we make them or take folks to dinner at Havana.  I do them in the oven in the winter and on the BBQ in the summer.  We also sometimes used peppered backon (applewood smoked from Nueske's in WI only) they ship.

This recipe is insane.  Madness.  And it totally works.  I made it at an office party, and there were none left to take home.  The trick is not to mention what they're made of--everyone thought that they were BBQ chicken wrapped in bacon--so that the more conservative eaters give it a shot. :)  Delicious.

Was very easy to make and came out delicious. Instead of Broiling I set the oven at 350 and let them cook for about 30 minutes (15 minutes in turning them over). Also, no need for toothpicks while in the oven if you make sure the flap/unrolled end of the bacon is at the bottom of the pan when you first put them in the oven,

Served christmas eve to our guests and I could tell people were trying not to eat them all up but really wanting more!  Used dates from a bulk bin where we could easily slip a raw almond inside. Used turkey bacon because that's what we had on hand.  Be careful - one of our dates still had a pit in it.  Served with maple syrup dipping sauce that our guests loved!  Great for people trying to eat paleo.

Very labor intensive (I put my hubby to work stuffing the dates) but so worth the trouble! Absolutely delicious! I made over 150 of these for a party and there was not a single one left. Everyone wanted the recipe. Tip: I roll mine in brown sugar, I think it adds a little something extra! YUMMY! Can't wait to try the suggestion of the thick cut deli bacon!

I just finished making these, and the recipe is a keeper!  I really don't like broiled bacon; it stays too rubbery for my taste.  So I put about 3/4 - 1 inch of oil in a large frying pan and fried mine.  I did everything the recipe said except for the fact that I fried mine.  Also, the recipe doesn't say this, but you have to cut the bacon strips in half (or else buy 2 pounds of bacon, but I think that throws off the balance).

We stuffed some with almonds and some with a small cube of smoked gouda cheese!  We loved both combinations but everyone went crazy over the cheese stuffed ones.  So yummy even for people who don't like dates!  And I baked them instead of broiling.

These are a huge hit at every party we've had. They disappear as soon as we put them out -- some of our friends even wait for them in the kitchen!

For variety, I also add a little goat cheese to about half of the batch, and it's delicious!

I use smoked almonds, and I use 1/3 of a slice of bacon to wrap each date.  First time I took these to a family reunion, they were the first appetizer gone.  Delicious!!!!!!

This recipe has been an old stand by for years.  It's quick and I almost always have the ingr. on hand.  Howeve I made one switch years ago that has saved a lot of time.  Instead of using the whole almond I use almond butter(and sometimes peanut butter) in the middle of the date.  It makes it so much easier to get the toothpick in.  I bake instead of broil to have the even cooking of the bacon.  Yum.  My sister also brushes hers with real maple syrup before putting in the oven.  I don't thought, to sweet.

A really big hit at our party.  I used regular Dole dates from the dried fruit section and thick cut bacon., only 1/2 or even 1/3 a piece per date was needed.  Delicious.  they go from getting crispy to burning in the oven quickly, so you really have to watch them, and make sure your pan has a lip to catch the fat run off, we made a bit of a mess in our oven. I had these at a wedding once several years ago and never forgot them. I was so happy to find a recipe here - this will be a standard party app for us from now on!

Rather easy to prepare and SO good. I made them for a party, kept them warm in a chafing dish which wasn't even necessary they were gone so quickly. Delicious recipe!
Edited 4/20/07:
I stuffed some goat cheese (Chevre) into the cavity of the date, along with the almond. AMAZING!

I made these last Christmas and everyone loved them...even those who don't love dates.  In the past, I have made water chestnuts wrapped in bacon baked with a brown sugar and soy sauce combination.  The almonds and dates were eaten even more quickly.

These are easy to make and a huge hit!  I precook the bacon a little first which makes them less greasy.  They are great with dried apricots instead of dates, too!

Really easy to put together and get into the oven! It was such an unusual treat for my family, but everyone who tried one loved it! I made the mistake of getting low-sodium bacon. I'd recommend regular bacon b/c the salt with the sweet was lacking a bit with low-sodium.

I have made these a few times and they are always a great hit at parties. I've had the best results with dates that were sealed in their own container (I used bulk dates last time and they were slightly dry). Also, bacon really needs to be old fashioned thick sliced bacon, it makes a HUGE difference and then you only need 1/2 a slice for each date. I use 1/2 a pecan and feta to stuff the dates and they are awesome!!! Thanks for the great idea.

My Mom makes this every year for our family's Christmas Eve Appetizer Potluck Party. We call it Devils on Horseback (there are also Angels on Horseback - same thing but with oysters instead of dates and almonds). The only change we make is to drizzle a little orange juice concentrate on top of them right beofre they go in the oven. DELICIOUS!!!!!

I love these (family is unsure about the whole "bacon candy" taste). But "I" love them, so they get five stars!  I used almonds in some, and chopped jalapenos in others - TRY the jalapenos, it's so good!

Sounds strange but SO delicious.  Trust me try it.  You can't eat many because of the richness,but Mmmmmmm.

I used smoked almonds and thin sliced bacon, so it was crunchy.  Keep you eye on them constantly and I turned them 1/2 way through.

These are better with goat cheese (or cream cheese)with the almond to add some moisture, and a little brown sugar on top of the bacon to bring out the date flavor.

Great recipe. Really easy if you use the large pitted dates in the deli section and stuff wih whole almonds. I used half a slice of thick sliced bacon and baked at 450 on foil lined pan.

Many here have tried frying in peanut oil. I use the microwave.  When making large batches for a party, etc. I will start one batch in the broiler and then rotate the batches to the microwave and the broiler.  Microwave really does a great job with bacon, and paper towels absorb the extra grease.  They come out great, but there is really no savings in time, especially with a large batch.
Love this taste of the sweet dates and the bacon.

Wow! These were a huge hit! I substituted sliced water chestnuts for the nuts. Baked them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, turned them and baked for an additional 10 minutes.
They're even good when they've cooled as they caramelize! Delicious!

Had something very similar at The Painted Pony - an  upscale restaurant in Saint George, Utah.  The only difference was they added crumbled bleu cheese on top and drizzled with a port wine reduction.  I'm sure they also used applewood smoked bacon. YUMMY!

Everyone loved them at our Christmas party.  All were pleasantly surprised by the crunch inside.  Reading the reviews from others, I took the advice to use thick-sliced bacon.  I made some with the dates stuffed with almonds, as well as water chestnuts.  Both versions were loved.

In looking for different appetizers, I liked this idea. My son who lives in Manhatten confirmed it was good so I tried it for a holiday party. BIG HIT!! And so easy. I did it the morning of the event and used the oven at 350 so I could dovetail other prep. While it took longer, not as likely to burn if you're busy.

So for next time:

Smaller dates (larger ones tend to make this treat way too sweet!)

Instead of almond, perhaps a Kalamata olive!

I used thick center-cut bacon and used 1/2 piece per date.  I used large pecan quarters, sprayed them with spray margarine, then tossed with cajun seasoning before stuffing one into each date.  I fried in peanut oil, then when they were draining on the paper towels, I gave another generous sprinkle of cajun seasoning.  Very rich - but nice for a special occasion!!

Not sure where I went wrong, but in my hands this recipe went right down a bad alley. No one ate more than a couple of these, and I nearly set my stove on fire.

These were so good.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I used half a slice of thin bacon and did not use toothpicks. I broiled for 10 minutes and thay turned out great!

We had an open house at work that I made these for.  I didnt make a whole lot of them becuase I didnt know how they would go over.  Everyone loved them.  I had to tell people over and over again exactly what they were.  I used smoked almonds instead of regular almonds.

Had a giant (80-90 people) housewarming party and served these.  These were SUCH a hit!  No one can ever figure them out...and the uniqueness made them that much more popular!  Pretty easy to prepare--a little labor intensive (stuffing and wrapping), but worth the fuss.  I followed the other recommendations: used THICK deli bacon, salted/smoked almonds and fried in peanut oil!! Delicious! Highly recommend!

This was good and got eaten up pretty fast at my family get together. I used the deli thick bacon but didn't know how much to wrap around the dates. I started out cutting it in half - and didn't have enough. Next time I'll cut the bacon into 1/3. This recipe is good and fairly easy. I would make it again.

Followed the 400 degrees for 20 minutes as suggested by others and then broiled for the last 5 to 10 - depending on how you like the bacon (crispier or softer).  Used sliced almonds.  Sauteed the almonds in a frying pan with butter, brown sugar, garlic powder and salt. Then stuffed them in the dates and wrapped with the bacon.  If you wrap tight enough and place properly you don't need the toothpicks.

For my son's wedding, I made them with cream cheese and some with gruyere. The ones with the cream cheese actually tasted best, imo! (This would give it 5 stars, but I am rating the original recipe.)

To make them, I slit the dates and stuffed the cheese. I cut the bacon into thirds and wrapped around each date. I then skewered five or six of them on wooden skewers that I'd soaked in water. 
They were baked in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes. Because they were on skewers, it was easy to turn them over half-way thru and brown the bacon on the opposite side. I transfered them to wire racks to cool a bit before serving. 
To serve, push them off the skewers and serve with or without toothpicks.

When we first tried them hot out of the oven we didn't like them very much, but once they had cooled to room temperature the flavor and texture is completely different. My husband and I really liked them.  I'll be making them again, trying different kinds of nuts as well.

Served this appetizer at a wine/beer party and it was a huge hit! I skipped the almonds this time but may try it that way next time. A little crunch would be even more delicious. Someone at the party had made this and had put blue cheese in the dates which sounds wonderful as well. I will definitely serve these again. So easy!

These were great!  Everyone loved them.  We also tried them with blue cheese instead of almonds and blue cheese with almonds and everyone liked the plain almond ones the best. I cooked them at 375 for 40 min, flipping them over half way through the baking time.  I will definitely make them again!

I had these at a party a good number of years ago and still remember them because I think I ate 20 and only felt slightly guilty.  They were soooo good!  I don't remember whether they were raw or cooked almonds but I do remember they were cooked over a gas grill and served still warm.  Sweet, salty and nutty.  I will make these again soon but will try them over a charcoal grill.  These are the ultimate party appetizer.

How can you not love these? Bring this to a get-together and everyone will love you. Substitute turkey bacon for regular bacon to make it healthier.  Seems that you should broil 5 minutes, then pull out and turn them over and broil another 5 minutes to get a good, even cook.

they were a breeze to prepare and only took 25 minutes in a 350 oven. I am unsure why some thought it was tedious. i pitted the dates, put some walnuts inside and wrapped some bacon on it. pop in the oven and wait. thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I used half slices of bacon and experimented with plain and seasoned almonds.  The seasoned almonds gave them a nice extra flavor.

Whatever you do, don't substitute with lean turkey bacon. I tried to make it healthier by doing so but it just didn't have the rich flavor it's suppose to have. Overall, it's good, but it would be better to only put half an almond into each date.

Everyone at the party tried one but didn't really go back for seconds. The dates were a bit too sweet for us.  I used the ready crisp bacon which might have detracted from the flavour.

Made these for our work Xmas party.  People were really intrigued with the ingredients when I told them what they were.  They were the only appetizer that was totally gone by the end of the night.  I thought that they were pretty good, and that the salty sweet combo was uniquely tasty.

I enjoyed these. They're both chewy/crunchy & sweet/savory. I baked them on a cast iron griddle for 10 min. on the bottom rack of the preheated to 400F oven before switching the oven to broil and moving the griddle to the top rack to brown the tops for a few minutes. They came out perfect.

This recipe just proves that EVERYTHING tastes better with bacon.  I made it exactly as suggested, and they were wonderful!  On a side note, those who give this recipe a low rating when they changed just about everything in it should be ignored.

I totally agree that baking them is better. I have one thing to add. When I was in Bahrain (little country next to Saudi Arabia) a little restaurant served these, (yes they used bacon) with a mango sauce. Delicious! You could use Mango Jam or make your own. Two large mangoes, 2 tablespoons of lime juice, and 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar, or to taste. Blend mangoes in food processor until smooth, add lime juice and sugar and there you have it. Serve as a dipping sauce. If you can get your hands on dates from Saudi Arabia such as Sukkary they are fabulous!

This is a tasty, easy, beautiful appetizer! I have made it three times using the oven - bake at 400 for approx 10 min and they are wonderful!! They are sweet almost like a bacon candy - truly a treat and so easy it's ridiculous.

I loved these and so did my friend.  I could not find pitted dates so I had to manually remove the pits first so I could put almonds in them.  So it took a little while but they were awesome.  I baked in 350 degrees oven till bacon looked crisp.....

This is always a hit, very easy to make and just delicious! The only thing I do different is that I use a couple of sliced almonds instead of whole almonds. It gives a little more crunch and it's easier to get the tooth pick through.

Love these! They were a HUGE hit at my dinner party! I followed the other suggestions of baking them at 400 instead of broiling for a bit longer, and used aluminum foil on the bottom of the pan to reduce cleanup--they they came out perfectly!

As a professional caterer I am always looking for new appetizers to delight the palate of my customers.  This is extremely delish and easy.  I used cashews instead of almonds and it was and is very good.  Highly recommend this for anyone wanting something sweet and salty.

I made these for a dinner party and they were a huge hit!!  I did half of them with just the almond in them, the other half I did with the almond and a small piece of feta.  Definitely a great mix of the sweet/salty that so many people like!

I make those with walnuts and they turn out fantastic. You can substitute dates with Prunes-I ate them once at friend`s place and it was equally good. I usually use oven but I cooked it once in the microwave and even that was good :D Love this recipe!

This is a family favorite.....We actually stuff a piece of pineapple inside, wrap the date with bacon then roll it into a spicy dry mix......talk about incorporating every flavor.....sweet, salty, tangy and spicy all in one bite!! Only downside.....they don't look very pretty!!!!

Wonderful!  This sounds wierd, but trust me - they are great.  Use smokehouse flavored almonds for more flavor and this works best with cheap bacon (not too thick).

I took this to a tapas party on New Year's Eve.  Everyone at the party loved them.  I didn't tell them what they were at first because I didn't want any preconceived ideas. They were so easy to make-I had my eleven year old make them while I made other appetizers. :) P.S. I bought the dates that were already pitted-you can get them on the produce isle.

With all the decent reviews, I thought this was the perfect appetizer to bring as a Christmas appetizer.  Boy, was I wrong.  These were not enjoyed by my friends and family at all.  Everyone tried them, and they all had the same expression on their faces while chewing, like "What is in this?".  I guess they are not fans of sweet/salty dishes.

Great appetizer that was a big hit at a tapas party that we threw. The pitted dates I used had holes large enough to sneak the almonds in, so cutting the dates weren't necessary. We only used 1/3 bacon slice per date, and they turned out well. This recipe is a keeper.

These were a TREMENDOUS success at a cocktail party at my boss’ house.  EVERYONE loved them, even those who didn’t think they liked dates.  I read that others used half or quarter slices of bacon, but I found that one whole slice of center cut bacon worked best…it was leaner, and cut the sweetness a little bit.  I prepared them the night before and stuck them in the fridge.  Also, I had to broil them for well over 15 minutes to get the bacon crispy.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful.  These are my new party favorite!!!

These were very tasty but also extremely sweet. I used thick sliced maple flavored bacon and the flavor was tremendous but after two or three, all I could taste was sweetness. I used slivered almonds because that was all I had and didn't incur any problems. Also, I was able to get about five or six dates wrapped with one slice of bacon. Will make again with another kind of thick sliced bacon and whole almonds.

I had high hopes for this appetizer after all the amazing reviews.  I made them and quickly had to leave for my party where I was taking them.  I read that they were fine cooled off a bit, so wasn't worried that they wouldn't be piping hot.   When I tasted them out of the oven, I wasn't overwhelmed.  A bit disappointed even.  I even tried cooking a few of them more, to see if they would be better, because the bacon just didn't seem right.  Not crunchy enough.   People ate them at the party, but I wasn't near the table to hear comments.  I had about half the recipe at home because i made too many, so I put them in the fridge before leaving.   Well, I must say that after a day in the fridge, I just tried one and they were DELICIOUS!   So, I definitely preferred them cold.  The flavors mixed much better and the bacon seemed crunchier and just really good!   So, I would make these again, but definitely make them ahead of time and chill first!

I did what others suggested by cooking the bacon wrapped dates @400 for 12-15 minutes. Everyone loved them and an entire plate was empty within minutes. The only real issue with these things is they run out quickly!

My brother brought this to a whole new level. Use Medjool dates. Pit them. Add half of a sea scallop inside  instead of the almond. Wrap with bacon and bake 20 minutes at 400 degrees.With the drippings, add tablespoon butter and  2 tblspoons brown sugar into small pan.. Whisk together.. drizzle over the baked bacon/date/scallop appetizer. Serve. AMAZING!

Like it with dates. You can halve the dates and the bacon. Better with prunes (half prune and half a bacon strip) - don't tell and no one can guess you used prunes!

I liked the overall flavor of the bacon and date appetizer. I cut the bacon too short, I should have allowed way more overlapped. I popped them in the microwave on a paper towel lined plate (helped get rid of extra grease too) right before guests arrived.

I used thick cut bacon and stretched the bacon around the dates which caused the bacon to shrink and unwrap after about 10 minutes of baking, so I toothpicked the second batch, I baked at 400' and turned over once the bottoms were brown.  Baked them for around 30-40 minutes (double batch) and kept a close eye on them.  Stuffed half with toasted almonds and half with chunks of quality aged parmesan.  I loved the parmesan ones better.

I used turkey bacon and they were not as good as usual. So don't use turkey bacon, you need the fat in regular bacon to make this tastey and moist.

Great premise, but the dates were more pliable (and more easily stuffed) when briefly dipped into hot water before slicing them. 

In deference to the holder folks with slipperty teeth, I used two strips of almonds rather than a full almond. 

Deli bacon is best, but I still cut off the excess fat, and then baked them instead of broiling.

While this was yummy. We like to stuff the date with manchego cheese. When we can not get the quality of manchego, we opt for the almond. Also, the thick slice bacon and baking at 400 degrees is the better option (less charring and more even cooking.

I made these for a small gathering and they were a big hit.  I followed other reviewer recommendations and baked them and I skipped the almonds for allergy reasons.  After baking I stuffed some of them with goat cheese which made them even better.  Definitely a keeper!

This is  my favorite appetizer.  Dangerous.  I could eat them all myself.  I freeze these well ahead.  I made the mistake one year of using a maple bacon and ooh, way too sweet for me.  I also use pecans instead of the almonds.  Personal preference I guess.

I had bought a package of dates rolled in chopped almonds and wanted to use them up.  I decided to try them with this recipe.  I chopped the date with almonds in half, and wrapped half a strip of bacon around it.  It turned out delicious!  Being health-conscious, I couldn't eat more than a couple, but this makes for a tasty and filling appetizer!  Not to mention ridiculously easy.

I've always made something similar and I'm sure these are good the way they are, but to add some flare, I stuff mine with soft plain goat cheese with the almond, then wrap them in bacon.  They are awesome and everyone always gives me a strange look when they ask what's in them, but everyone loves them.  They're a definite favorite!

Great.  I had these at a party and the hostess would not tell us the ingredients until we tried them.  (I do not like dates, nuts or bacon) but this dish was really, really good.  It has changed my opinion about how I view foods.

I made this appetizer for a family gathering this past weekend.  EVERYONE just loved it.  I ommitted the almond (mostly to save time) and it was still terrific.  I used 1/2 a bacon strip per date.  I have had this appetizer at a tapas bar I frequent in NYC....I'm so happy I can make it myself!

Good, but I like the bacon-wrapped waterchestnut in brown sugar recipe better. The savory bacon tastes nice with the sweet date, though. I guess I expected more from all the reviews but a friend told me that she just couldn't get enough of these. Maybe it's a matter of personal taste?

I think this is ok...but I sprinkle light brown sugar on the bacon and I add a slice of water chestnut in the pitted date, and wrap the bacon around the date.  Its great!

Fattening I'm sure - but oh so good! Takes time. Wonder about other stuffers -suggestions? Can eat hot, warm or cold. Reheats easily. Leaving in a warm oven allows bacon to become done throughout, and allows the 2nd batch to be ready for serving. Not your everyday appetizer treat. Will do again when adequate prep time allows. Nice for a change!

My mother has made this for over 50 years and she is of Finnish descent so I don't think this is Native.  But it is really good!  Another good one is dates, sliced open to remove pit, stuffed with peanut butter and rolled in powdered sugar.  Everyone likes it, That is if they like dates.

I had my doubts, but this did not disappoint. It was the first of many appetizers completely consumed. I used roasted salted almonds and the bacon slices cut into thirds. I baked them at 400 for about 30 minutes, leaving a couple pieces in longer until crispy.

Delicious!  I made these for the appetizer stop on a progressive dinner.  No one had eaten them before and they were a hit.  I didn't use toothpicks and I had about 1/3 come unwrapped.  I baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes.  I popped the ones that still had some uncooked bacon in the microwave for about a minute and that finished them off right!  Definitely a keeper.

OK - seriously this. Is. Awesome! I made this for New Year's Eve party and came out awesome. Now, admittedly, I'm becoming a grillmaster, and had my own maple bacon that I did from scratch that I used as I had an extra batch around. So it tasted great with that. Couple things I would say - make sure you have the non pitted dates for sure. When I did this instead of putting a slice of almond, I use delivered almonds, then crushed, fried in a pan for about 5 minutes in a little bit of butter, gave it kind of a nice roasted flavor, and then insert that into each date, closed it back up, wrapped with bacon and then baked.

The other thing I would say is I'm a fan of a more crisper bacon, so what I did is I laid the bacon on one side with the toothpicks in it for 10 minutes. When that time was up I flipped to the other side and baked another 10 minutes so both sides were crispy. And according to the guests who ate it - it was awesome. Great recipe highly recommend doing it very easy!

Huge hit as Thanksgiving appetizer - I used advice by other person to deep fry Dates first then stuff with almond.   This way it is not so sweet.  Everyone was shocked they liked it as much as they did!   I also like well done thick bacon so we left in low broil for 10 mins then flipped and added another 5.

Delicious and easy to make! Dates give it a bit of sweetness (verses using brown sugar, like similar recipes), the nut gives it some crunch, and who doesn't like bacon!

If you pre-cook the bacon a little bit, it makes it easier to wrap the dates. (Not necessarily  a Native American dish as these are called Devils on Horseback in the UK.)

So good that they were gone within 15 minutes. I made as written the first time and the second time, I stuffed with blue cheese. They were even more awesome. Don't forget to turn them half way through the bake time.. I baked them instead of broil. Put them on a rack so the grease drops down on to the cookie sheet with a one inch lip.

I overcooked them a little but still delicious. Next time I think I will use 1/2 piece of bacon so you can taste the date a little more.

This came out great. I decided to chop the almonds up and mix them with goat cheese. I cut the dates in half and put the cheese and almond in between the 2 pieces. Then wrapped with a half a piece a bacon. I made them for a party and there were none left within the first hour.

Wow, these were fantastic! I took the suggestion of others and baked them at 400 for 20 minutes, turning halfway. I also used marcona almonds instead of regular. I was worried the bacon would overpower the dates but they turned out perfect.

When I went to the store I wasn't able to find dates, so I subbed in dried plums. I also did a little extra honey- and I used what I had in the cupboard which was wildflower honey. For the bacon, I followed other people's comments and used thick cut hickory smoked bacon. Also, I put tin foil on the cookie sheet before baking them so I didn't have to clean the mess.  I then baked them at 400° for 15 minutes, flipping once half way through. Then broiling at the end to crisp them. 
While they were greasy (which was inevitable due to the use of bacon and cheese), and I had to push some of the cheese back in, they were to die for delicious. They were all eaten the minute I put them out. I will definitely make them again! I suggest putting them on a paper towel first before serving them to let the grease soak off.

Use 1/2 pieces of thin bacon and broil under high for twice as long, checking every 4 minutes.  Take toothpicks out and flip over 1/2 way through.  Next time I'm trying baking them at 400 like someone suggested.

I absolutely *hate* dates.  But I really *love* this appetizer!

Sounds odd, but it's true.  I don't like dates because they are so darn sweet.  But the bacon and the salted almond blend so beautifully with the date, that this has become a favorite of mine.

I made these following other reviewers suggestions to bake at 400 for a little longer rather than broiling them. I stuffed mine with Gorgonzola cheese rather than an almond and they were really good! I placed mine on a rack inside a roasting pan and lined the pan with foil to make cleanup easier. Will definitely make these again!

These were easy enough to make, but didn't wow me or any of my guests.  I'm sure it's just a matter of personal taste, though, and I'm glad I tried the recipe.  Thanks for sharing, CINNTX!

Soooo I have found: 1) you can cut each slice of bacon into FOUR pieces and 2) stretch each 1/4 slice around each date, put them on the cookie sheet seam-side-down and you don't even need to use toothpicks! Ridiculously easy & tasty!

My local market did not have any dates, and I was running short on time. I noticed they had dried figs, so I decided to substitute them. And while I still want to try them with dates, the figs were excellent. .

We use a small slice of hard parmesean cheese instead of the nut... I've also had it stuffed with blue cheese. It is yummilicious any way you make it. I like tu use the 'center cut' style bacon, it's generally better quality, spendy so look for sales &coupons... Vows has it buy one get one free and I use one pack & freeze the other

I can't believe these have become popular once more! They were the absolute high end cocktail party fave's during the early '50's and would be the first to disappear. I prefer to use low sodium bacon as it truly compliments the flavour of the dates

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer.  Simply delicious!  The sweetness of the dates goes great with the saltiness of the bacon.  I stuffed half of them with almonds and the other half with water chestnuts, and they both turned out great.  Overall, very simple to make too.

Just wrapped half piece of fairly thin bacon around California pitted dates vacuum-packed; used toothpicks. Broiled 10 min. and took out and turned them over and broiled another five min. Worked perfectly. Did not use almonds. First time trying them - very good. Since I did not use almonds, gets 5 stars

These didn't work out too good for me. They were also alot of trouble to make for me.

Had this at a new years party. We used Smokehouse almonds and thick slice bacon. The mix between sweet dates, nutty almonds and the smoky salty taste from the bacon and almonds was very nice.

This is SO delicious.  It's just as good without the almonds.  It's sweet, chewy, cripsy and so unique.

I would not make these again. They did not have much flavor I even added a nice cheese with the almond. But not for me.

I've been craving these ever since I made them.  A little tricky to make, but worth it.  And I didn't think I liked dates!
