The key to this is to cook it until it's done, but don't overcook it.  I think I overcooked mine because it was a little dry and rubbery, but the blueberries (I used frozen) were plenty juicy which gave it moisture, and all was good in the end.   The only thing that I didn't care for was the whole wheat flour, and I will switch to all purpose white flour (personal preference) in the future.  It may not have been pretty, but it was big enough for two of us to split for breakfast, and pretty tasty.  Have to wonder if a little streusel topping on this might improve its eye appeal.  This certainly has potential,  just need to get the timing figured out for your own microwave.

I've just moved and have no mugs unpacked but have 3 types of cupcake/muffin liners on hand so my own hand folded version came into play inside an all purpose Pyrex bowl. It worked but probably required more time because the heat wasn't held closely. 

Someday mugs or prep bowls will see the light of day and microwave mug cooking will enjoy a Renaissance after a decade of being forgottenâ€¦

I made mine without all of the extra spices and it was still super good. Fast and easy, 5 stars!

Mine looked good--it took 90 seconds, wasn't overcooked and had a good consistency. However, I didn't care much for the taste. I couldn't taste much of the spices, mostly just tasted the wheat flour, and I thought the baking soda was a bit overwhelming. Thankfully it was full of blueberries to give it some flavor.

I will make this again. I substituted all-purpose flour for the whole wheat flour, as I like it better,  and rice milk for the milk.

I made a gluten free version of this recipe by replacing the whole wheat flour with almond meal. I also used 1/3 cup fresh blueberries and 1/4 of a banana (sliced in quarters). In total, it took about 3.5 minutes to cook. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the clove was a bit too much for me. Next time, I won't use clove.

It was great!  I used almond milk and put some Light Vanilla Yogurt on top. I'll for sure be making this again.

I tried making this twice. It turned out rubbery on top and not cooked on the bottom both times. The flavor is good, but consistency is off. I will probably keep plying with the recipe because it is so easy for the toddler to help with, and she loves to cook.
