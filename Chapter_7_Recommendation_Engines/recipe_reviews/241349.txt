Made this and it turned out well. I added two tbsp honey, used chocolate protein powder instead of vanilla and doubled the ground flax because I didn’t have any sesame. I suppose I could have used chia seed. Given how high in protein these are I think they’re great. Even my kids enjoyed them. If you like sweet things then you would likely want to up the honey. Once baked they firmed up quite nicely.

I would give these 2.5 stars, but I think I might've screwed my chances at success by using half vanilla protein powder with a mix of BCAA powder (super bitter) and hemp protein. Next time, I'd cover these in melted chocolate!
