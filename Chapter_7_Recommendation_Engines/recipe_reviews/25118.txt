This recipe was great and a big hit at my job!  I increased peanut butter to a little over one cup and increased vanilla to 2 tsp. I also baked the cookies about 14 minutes.  They came out perfect.  They had a little crunchy, yet soft texture. Thanks to previous reviewers for their suggestions!  I hope this helps others!

Very good cookies!  If you want more peanut butter taste instead of chocolate chips I just put in peanut butter chips.  They are wonderful!

These are great! I added slightly less flour and skipped the walnuts, and added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. My husband says they are the best chocolate chip cookies he's ever had. He's had a LOT, so that's saying something. Thanks for the recipe!!

I used equal amounts white and dark sugars, super chunk peanut butter and I cut back a little on the flour like SunnyByrd did (I used 2 1/4 cups flour). Because I had it on hand, I used a combination of Reese's peanut butter chips and Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips. I really packed my small cookie scoop--I wanted bigger sized cookies. My cookies were done at eleven minutes, that made them a little bit underdone which made for a softer and chewy cookie. The boys loved these, they can't keep their hands off of them!

mmm, I used a cup of crunchy peanut butter in this recipe. I didn't have dark brown sugar; only light brown and it stll came out good. I omitted the oats and walnuts because I didn't have them on hand. They were good even without all the ingredients. My family liked them.

Just got these out of the oven and they are delicious! The recipe is good as is, but if you want a little more peanut butter flavor maybe go for a full cup instead of 2/3c.

These cookies actually came out tasting ok.  But not because of the recipe.  I'm not sure what other people did that turned out so well, but when I mixed this all together, it wasn't just dry, the mixture was almost the consistency of straight flour.  I checked the ingredients 3 times and I'm sure I didn't leave anything out.  I would start with 1 cup flour and go up from there.  I more than doubled the peanut butter, added almost a full stick of butter extra, and then gave up on that and just started adding milk till the consistency was that of cookie dough.  They turned out great in the end but I think that was just luck.

These cookies were absolutely delicious. I used dark chocolate chips and they tasted like they came from a specialty bakery. They have a crispy outside, but a chewy inside. Perfect!

These are awesome. Chewy and soft with a little crisp around the edges. I followed other reviews and put in a full cup of peanut butter.

I loved this because it had a light peanut taste but my husband and daughter wanted more peanuty taste next time (roll my eyes).  My changes: halved the recipe (got 20 cookies), cup of flour, skipped the walnuts, added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and used reeses chips instead of chocolate. So for sure, next time add more peanut butter. With every peanut butter  cookies I make, I always sprinkle sugar on top right when I tale the cookies out of the oven.

Definitely edible, and the boys didn't complain... but this isn't my ideal PB cookie.  What it is: very nicely soft and chewy, tastes a little candy-like, good old-fashioned brown sugar taste, and the peanut butter is definitely there... They're definitely good, and they might be your one peanut butter cookie.  I think I'd want more emphasis on peanut.  They're great with Reese's Pieces instead of the chocolate.

DELICIOUS! 
Slightly crunchy texture on the outside, soft and chewy inside. I read through the reviews and followed other recommendations to up the amount of peanut butter to 1 cup. Excellent! I also used "extra crunchy" peanut butter and skipped the walnuts altogether. If Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were ever turned into a cookie, these would be it. SO GOOD!

There are way too many chocolate chips for this cookie dough, and they are very difficult to incorporate because the cookie dough is very thick and greasy, so the chips just "slide" out of it. I'd recommend cutting the chocolate chip amount in half.  Otherwise, the cookies taste pretty good but I prefer the texture and taste of other peanut butter cookies I've tried over this recipe.

Thanks for a really delicious cookie!! I just love the taste of peanut butter. Once I somehow forgot the eggs but they where still good!! Infact they tasted even more of peanut butter. My family loves these and even my dog can't get enough of them :)

I loved these cookies! I like a lil more peanut taste so I did what others said and added more peanut butter, and more vanilla. They are AWESOME, nice size, chewy, and just a lil crisp around the edges. Will be making these again real soon!! ;) I rate these a 5!

I'm baking these right now and just "taste tested" one... these are AWESOME!! Not only do they taste great - they look like cookies purchased from the bakery.  The only tweaking I did to the recipe was to increase the peanut butter to 1 cup (Skippy Superchunk!) and omitted the walnuts. Came out perfectly!

Great cookie!  Husband LOVED them.  The chocolate chips didn't really stick to the dough well when added, but I just stuck the loose ones on the tops which made them prettier anyway.  Couldn't really taste the peanut butter.

I thought this recipe was fine. However, it did not have a strong enough peanut butter flavor for my taste even though I did increase the amount to 1 cup. It also calls for too many chocolate chips. On the plus side the cookies are plump and chewy as promised.

"Best cookie I've ever had!" said my boss when I took these to work.  Really moist and not cakey at all.  I followed the recipe except for adding more peanut butter as others suggested, and substituting honey-roasted peanuts for the walnuts for even more peanut flavor.  These goes into the keeper file!

Very good but not very peanut buttery.  I didn't use the full amount of chocolate chips and I added maybe 1/4 c  more peanut butter.  They had a nice chewy texture.

I followed the recipe, except I omitted the walnuts. I thought these where ok. I have made other peanut butter chocolate chip cookies that I liked much better. The texture to me is almost stale. Not sure why.

I've been trying several different cookie recipes incorporating peanut butter for my husband.  Ever since I made this recipe, this is the one he always wants me to make!  It has a very good peanut butter to chocolate chip ratio!

This recipe had fairly good taste, but maybe not 'peanut buttery' enough.  also, they weren't as moist as I like my cookies to be, so I'll be tweaking the recipe a bit.

So delicious! I spiced it up with a little more peanut butter using half peanut butter chips and half chocolate chips. These cookies are amazing! I had to give them away so I wouldn't eat them all!

These turned out great!  I did change some things, though.  I omitted the chips and nuts (just because I felt like a peanut butter cookie, but I'm sure they would be good with them), increased the p.b. to 1 cup (and used chunky p.b.).  I baked them for 10 minutes and let them sit on the pan for another 5 min. before moving to cooling racks.  Sooooo good!

Excellent cookies.  They did not spread at all for me, and I'm a bit shocked.  I did refrigerate the dough overnight, but I'm used to doing that and still having cookies spread.  They are very pretty, and with refrigeration 12-13 min was perfect.  I used chunky pb and 1/2 tspn of almond extract to make up for the fact that I have no almonds on hand.  thanks for the recipe!  One of my AR friends pointed out to me that there were no almonds called for in this recipe--they were walnuts.  Oops.  I guess my tendency to not read a recipe strikes again!  Anyway, they were good with the almond extract.  Perhaps I'll try to read the recipe next time.  Perhaps not . . .

Good recipe.  I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup as others suggested, but I still thought it could have more peanut butter flavor.  I will try again, but use chopped peanuts instead of walnuts.

Pretty good recipe!  Although, I too thought it called for way too many chocolate chips and walnuts so I used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of pecans and 1/2 cup chopped honey roasted peanuts (as per someones suggestion).  They turned out great this way!

I increased peanut butter to one cup, omitted walnuts, reduced chocolate chips to one cup which was already a lot for this recipe. Chocolate chips had a bit of trouble combining ( lots at the bottom of the bowl) so if I do it again I’ll use those small little chocolate chips. Otherwise cookies were a pretty good success

This recipe was great, the cookies don't spread much so be sure to press them.

I decreased the flour by 1/2 cup, used 1 cup peanut butter, doubled the vanilla, and used 3/4 cup each of white sugar and demara (dark brown sugar).   I found that the chocolate chips kept falling out as I tried mixing them in, so just rolled them into 1 1/2 inch logs and cut them  approximately 3/4 inch thick and pressed them lightly while panning.  I used parchment lined baking sheets and baked  10-11 minutes total, turning half-way through

I just made these using 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup chocolate chips and I halved the amounts of both the brown and white sugars. With the changes it was great though a touch on the sweet side. I have no idea what the original recipe would be like, but I really dislike super sweet cookies so am not going to try it that way.

I made the chocolate chip peanut butter cookies and it smells so delicious. I put 2 of the butter for the dough to be more creamy and omit the walnuts.

Too much flour in the reipe. This is the second time I made these cookies and both times the dough was so crumbly that I had to form the cookies, not roll into balls. It also does not hold the chocolate chips and the finished cookies are full of craters and crumbly. If you look through the pictures you can see this. That said, they taste very good, but are a hassle to make. 
    Since we can no longer make notes on saved recipes, I am writing a review to remember to try them with less flour.

These are ah.may.zing. I put in the remainder of my peanut butter jar (more than the recipe called for), and whatever flour I had left (less than the recipe called for, and these are GREAT. though, could probably have decreased the sugar proportionally to the flour. definitely helped some cavities along...

EXCELLENT!!!  I'm a farm wife and do a lot of cooking.  I was looking for another cookie recipe for my guys at harvest time.  This one is yummy!  The only change I made was reducing the flour to 1/3 cup.  By doing that I did just dropped the cookies on the my baking sheet with my cookie scoop and flattened them a little with my fingers.  Wonderfully moist and super delicious!!!

Awesome recipe! I used natural peanut butter and a tad less sugar (always do) and they turned out so amazing and perfectly formed! Delish--will definitely make again!

Substituted chips for baking m&m's, mix with spatula to keep from crushing them. Everything else exact and they turned out beautifully. ?

These cookies were delicious. I added a little more peanut butter and could have used a LITTLE less salt. Other than that they were great. I also made half of the batch with pecans (didn't have any walnuts handy) and without pecans and I prefer them without. I also think this would be a good recipe minus the chocolate chips as well--just a regular peanut butter cookie!

I followed other reviewer's recommendations and increased the peanut butter and vanilla.  I also baked them for about 9 minutes (but my oven is funny). Delicious!  Will make again!

I just got mine out of the oven and they are yummy!  I added 1/4 cup of Nutella instead of walnuts as my family doesn't like them.  I also used mini chocolate chips and regular brown sugar as I didn't have dark brown sugar.  A treat my hubby and kiddo's will be asking for MORE!!

Yummy! I would recommend less flour and less chocolate chips, but that's personal preference. In my opinion this is the best PB cookie recipe here.
