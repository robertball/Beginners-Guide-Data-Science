It was actually a disaster. Never thickened, had to serve in individual bowls, and served with spoons.  Flavour was good, but I wanted a thick cheesy dip. This was not it.

We really liked this dip! I also put everything right into the slow cooker and just kept stirring it. We don't care for rotel, so I used salsa in it's place, which worked great. I don't know what it is with me and melting shredded cheese...I bought a block of monterey jack and shredded it by hand, but it still made the finished dip a little grainy (happens every time I try to melt shredded cheese). The flavor was great, though. Next time I will still use the white American and just add velveeta to it, as it melts the best for me that way.  Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good recipe, but I thought the cumin was a tad over powering. Next time I will only put 1/2 tsp of cumin. I did not have any half and half and used milk,  worked just fine.  Easy to make and the family loves it!
