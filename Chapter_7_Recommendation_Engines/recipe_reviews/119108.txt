This recipe was very good but needed a little help.  I made as is the first time and it was a solid 4 stars.  The second time I used chicken broth instead of the cubes and I always add a little extra so it isn't quite so dry.  Instead of onion flakes I sauteed onion, fresh mushrooms, diced red pepper and a couple of diced Roma tomatoes and added this in after the couscous was finished and it went from 4 stars to 5.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I buy bulk couscous, so I followed the container suggestions for 2 cups water - 2 cups couscous.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a bachelor, and I wanted a quick and good way to prepare couscous without the need to buy the prepackaged mixes.  I did everything the directions called for -except- that I did not use any butter.  This was accidental, but it worked fine and I intend to keep it out next time for dietary reasons.  Great find.

I did not eat this myself, I made it for the boys. Instead of water and chicken bouillion granules, I used organic chicken broth. I made no other changes. Right before serving, I added one pat of butter on each serving. The kids ate every bite and asked for seconds. I'll make this again.

This wasn't very well liked in my house. We are new to couscous so if you already like it go ahead and try this one. There was an underlying taste that wasn't from the seasonings in this recipe. I did buy whole wheat couscous from a bulk bin so not sure if that is the taste of couscous or if it was stale.

This is a great basic recipe, one that I will refer to again and again when preparing couscous, even when I make my own adjustments. I'm also very happy to see a recipe that uses bouillon granules instead of cubes. The flavor of this is simple but it accompanies stronger flavored dishes perfectly. Thanks for the great referrence!

No flavor...at all.  It was also very dry.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up salvaging the couscous by adding a lot of salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Does the packaged couscous mean that it's already flavored?  I used the unflavored couscous from the bulk department of the grocery store.  Was this wrong???

This had a very good flavor and was easy to prepare.  It needs a little more liquid because it came out a tad on the dry side.

This was very flavorful and easy to prepare.

I used chicken broth because I did not have granules but should have used more.  The recipe called for 2 cups water so I used 2 cups chicken broth, but like some of the other reviewers stated, it turned out a little dry.  

Also, I did not cook as long as the couscous package indicated, and followed the recipe cooking time and mine came out a little chewy because of this.  

In summary, use more liquid and cook couscous according to package instructions for best results.

Will definitely make again with these small changes...my 8 and 5 year old LOVE this!

Used low sodium chicken stock in place of water and granules with lots of fresh basil and parsley along with the other ingredients. This ended up a little dry and bland tasting for us. I am going to try again with fresh onion, garlic and more herbs and either increase the liquid or use a little less couscous. We like the idea and look forward to trying it again with a few tweaks. Thanks for sharing!

I really lice this recipe and the suggestions given. I have been on a couscous adventure trying out the various addtions and touches. The one where I add mixed veggies and a side of saute bell peppers (green & red for a colorful mix) and onions is my favorite.

I thought this was good.  It tasted like the box one to me. I did add a little more water because others said it was a little dry. This made a lot for my family of 4.  We had leftovers.

I think this was a little bit too dry as well - the flavor was good, but nothing out of this world.  I think it tasted more like the flavoring you'd get from a flavoring packet that would come with rice or something.

Highly recommended....especially if your new to couscous like we are. I love using herbs in our meals--they have such an amazing flavor. Cooked for 10 minutes instead of 5, as that is what the directions were for our couscous, and it was perfect. I would make this again.

This was delicious! I used a chicken bouillon cube because I didn't have any granules. I used fresh basil and fresh garlic and left out the onion. Can't wait to make this again, thanks!

I thought this was great!  For me, a beginning cook, it provided a great side dish as well as a recipe base I intend to use many more times.  I agree that it was a bit dry, though the water-to-couscous ratio did match what was recommended on the couscous package.  I'll be upping the amount of water and seasoning next time, relative to the amount of couscous I use.  I'll also add more of each seasoning recommended, and will probably tweak it depending on what I have available. One reviewer said that this has the flavor of something that would come from a seasoning packet -- I agree with that somewhat, but to me that's a positive.  My husband and I love the pre-seasoned boxes of couscous with spice packs, and this recipe is the closest I've found to a simple, inexpensive recipe that packs a good side-dish punch. I expect we'll make this many, many times.  It comes together quickly and makes use of ingredients I almost always have on hand.  Thanks!

This was our first experience with couscous and it was a hit!  I did substitute Italian seasoning for the basil and parsley and used whole wheat couscous.  Simple and so fast. Delicious alongside the lemon pepper salmon from this site. Thanks for the post!

This dish came out very well and had nice flavor.  I'm not sure if couscous will wind up on our dinner menu again, as we were not totally sold on the couscous itself (nothing wrong with the recipe).  Couscous is just a little grainy.  I think we just like risotto and orzo better.

Good. I added the cumin like some others had suggested but, I donno, I feel like something was off with this recipe. The spice combo was alright--I just felt like something was missing. I added about 1/8 tsp lemon juice. I think a little more lemon juice would make this recipe better.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. In the past, we always found couscous to be kind of bland. This recipe added flavor without getting too complicated. Will be making again!
