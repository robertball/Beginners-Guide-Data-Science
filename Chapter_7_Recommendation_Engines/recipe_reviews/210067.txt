I agree with JHala...I was shocked to see this recipe not set up.  I reprocessed it and still no luck.  I have fresh picked blackberries that I will be attempting another batch within the next day or two with my own modifications.  I will say this the combination of the blackberries and jalapenos is fantastic.  I used the failed, but flavorful batch, to poach our awesome local salmon in the oven.  My husband LOVED it.    I will reply back with what modifications I used to get this recipe to really ROCK.

I'm back!  Ok just follow this recipe fro Sure-Jell. 

http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/surejell-blackberry-jelly-52038.aspx
 
Add the jalapenos with the pectin and butter and continue with the Sure-Jell directions.  It came out EXCELLENT!  I'm off to the store for some cream cheese and crackers...ta-ta!

When I made this recipe and it turned out great. Instead of juicing the berries, though, I pureed them and strained out the seeds. It set up great.

I have been making jelly for 25 years and have had very few batches fail. I followed the recipe exactly. It did not even thicken up enough to call it syrup. The flavor was great so I will try to reprocess.

RASBERRY JALAPENO JAM - I had quite a few rasberries picked and wanted to make some jam for Christmas gifts - could find no receipe at all so went rogue - followed the receipe on MCP Pectin sheet for rasberry jam, added 6 pretty hot jalapeno's and boy is it great - for a milder jam, add fewer peppers or milder ones.  I have discovered it's all in the heat of the pepper.
BLACKBERRY JALAPENO JELLY - I followed the receipe - I used 3 jalapeno's - all green with seeds and all - nice kick! It jelled up even before it finished cooling.  Used blackberry juice I had juiced the week before - pretty color - can't wait to try with cream cheese. I will use this receipe again! Thanks!
(Instead of processing, I turn boiling hot jars upside down for 1-2 minutes, then turn right side up and within 1/2 hour they all sealed.)

Just made this using Sure-Jell low sugar pectin and it set up before the second boil was even reached! Also I got almost 7 half pints not the 4 1/2 as the recipe says. I added an extra jalapeno but definitely could have added even more for more pepper flavor and heat. Came out looking pretty and very tasty!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an AWESOME recipe. The taste is wonderfully sweet and spicy at the same time. my family likes a little spice so i would recommend adding another 1-2 jalepenos. Some reviews said that they had a hard time getting it to set, after adding the 3 1/2 cups sugar i brought it to a hard boil for 2-3 minutes and it set without a problem. Thank you for the recipe it will be one that i use regulary!!!!!!

Love this recipe.  Had no trouble with it setting.  I did find however that you have to let it boil a bit longer than the recipe reccomends for it to set.  Be sure to test it on a cold plate before putting into jars and you won't go wrong.  Served this at my mom's birthday party to a discriminating crowd and people were swooning.  Delicious with chevre on crackers!  Yumm!

This was my first attempt at any jam/jelly/ preserve and I'm so glad I picked this one!!! This is an INCREDIBLE recipe! I followed the recipe with 2 large peppers, but I mashed whole berries and seived half of them to eliminate some of the seeds instead of juicing them (my prefrence). After reading the reviews about it not setting up well, I decided once I added the 3 1/2 cups of sugar, to bring it back to boil and set a timer to let it rolling boil for 5 full minutes. I used the cold plate test and it was beautifully set!!! The 2 large peppers are perfect heat for me and I love spicy foods. I yielded 6 half pints! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!!! I will definately be making this again!

I also made this recipe and it didn't set. I reprocessed it using Certo instructions and it turned out well, not as hot as I expected but good. I had to add 4 extra cups of sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice and I used 2 pouches of liquid certo.

I had 5 cups of blackberry purée  & I used 5 Tbs of low sugar pectin and a total of 1.5 cups sugar. I used 2 jalapeno & 2 serrano peppers. I heeded the advice of others and cooked it for about 6 minutes. It turned out great, but wish I'd made it a little spicier.

Excellent recipe. I added a third jalapeno pepper, and I'm quite glad I did. Next time I'll add a fourth. I left out all the pepper seeds though. For me, this gave enough jam for 7 half pint jars, not five as the recipe states. Might want to have extra on hand in case!

Excellent recipe when using freshly juiced blackberries.  Since everyone has different levels where they identify something as "hot", I always tend to err on the side of being conservative so everyone can enjoy it, and then go from there with the next batch.  I used 1 1/2 jalapenos, red and green, and it was warm to me.  My husband said he barely tasted the heat (see what I mean?).  All in all, a great and EASY recipe!

Love, love, love this recipe. I made tonight with the following tweaks: used about 6 cups of blackberries, cooked them with a cup of water and used a jelly bag to extract the juice. I ended up with just about 4 cups of juice, added more water to come up to the 4 cups. Used 2 big jalapeños and one big habanero for more heat. I read everyone’s complaints about it not setting up for them, so I used 9 tablespoons of pectin (1 1/2 box) then boiled 2 min after adding the sugar. Probably could have just used the one box as it was jelling immediately. Turned out beautiful. I posted the picture of my leftover jam I put in a container instead of my jar so you could see that it jelled. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  I like spice so I used 4 jalapeños instead of 2.  I also used 6 cups of fresh blackberries and puréed them.  I was worried about it not setting up (after reading the comments) so I did boil it a little longer than the recipe states.  I used the cold plate test to make sure it was ready to jar. I love this stuff!  I will probably spread it over cream cheese for crackers.  It is great on the fresh blueberry bread I just made as well!

I made this, doubled, but added several more Serrano chilis, about a cup and a half. When I tasted it raw, I thought I ruined the whole batch. WAY too hot. But, I cooked it down and canned it anyway.  I served it hot over brie cheese covered with a handful of feta crumbles, and rice crackers and Triscuits. The best treat, most addicting, ever!

I did not have a juicer, so I had to sieve out the seeds which was a long process.  However, the jelly was wonderful.  Sweet and spicy at the same time.  Makes really good BBQ sauce. Hint: add a little apple cider or red wine vinegar!

Love this!  Question... Though... Are we suppose to leave jalapeño seed in there or will that make it too hot?  Other jalapeño jelly recipe I have says leave seed in. I didn't in this one and it's almost like no spice to it.

I'm pretty sure I've never commented on this site, although I've been using it for years. Like so many others, I've been looking for a recipe for blackberry-jalapeno jelly for a long time. I first had it on baked brie at a jazz club, and I was hooked. I then found it in Truckee, CA, at a small little kitchen specialty store. However, being a blackberry lover, a few years back we planted a blackberry bush in our backyard that now yells, when we walk outside, "Feed me, Seymour!"

I can not thank you enough for posting this recipe! I just made my first two batches, with blackberries and jalapenos from our backyard/garden and holy moly is this recipe delicious! I made both batches using low-sugar pectin and one using Ideal (xylitol) instead of sugar. Both batches are setting up just fine. Like many here, I used more jalapenos than the recipe called for, and will probably use more next time - they don't seem as spicy after all the sugar is added. I also got 7 half-pint jars out of each batch.

Delicious! Thank you so, so much.

Sooooo easy and pretty!  Shared this with a friend that grows the most sour blackberries I've ever tasted. This recipes worked great and her jelly turned out perfect.

This has a good flavor, but for me, not hot enough.  My first batch did not really want to set up very good, so for the second batch I added lemon juice and a splash of apple cider vinegar, I also used 6 jalapenos seeds and all..  flavor with a nice kick!
