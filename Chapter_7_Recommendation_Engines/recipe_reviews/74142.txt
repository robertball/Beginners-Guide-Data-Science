Based upon the reviews, I doubled the amount of cayenne and black pepper to the flour mixture. I also seasoned the chops with salt and pepper prior to dredging them in flour. They were spicy and juicy...buffalo wing flavor with a twist! I might try using bread crumbs and baking these next time to reduce fat and calories, and then dunk them in the hot sauce. Thanks for the post!

Very tasty, but mine did not come out crispy. Most of the coating escaped into the cooking oil. I think I will try dipping in egg before the flour next time.

Delicious!  I followed suggestions to double the black pepper and the cayenne.  I also seasoned the pork chops prior to breading them with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.   My husband loved loved loved these pork chops, absolutely fabulous!

My boyfriend loved these... he said they had a bit of spice to them, but he would have liked more. I even upped the cayenne and black pepper to 1 teaspoon each and added chili powder. He has taste buds like nobody I've ever seen! I'm not much of a spicy food fan, so I skipped dipping my chop in the hot sauce and I thought it was perfectly yummy. So moist. Anyway, this is a keeper, thanks!

I fixed this tonight. My husband wanted some sort of spicy pork chops. I found this and thought I'd give it a try. He LOVED it! We both love spicy and this was perfect. We didn't drench the whole pork chop with sauce. We just spread a little on each side. Frank's RedHot is our favorite hot sauce anyway, and it worked great with the pork chops.

I have such a hard time finding recipes for fried porkchops. When I found these I KNEW I had to make them! We LOVE spicy foods! I used pancake mix instead of flour to give it that sweet and spicy flavor. It turned out pretty good. We also did what one of the previous reviewers said her husband did. We put it on a sandwich, but used shredded cheese instead of sliced. It was SO GOOD! Thank you for posting this recipe. It was truly amazing!

The chops came out good. However, I figured that the coating would be spicy and then I would let the family add the hot sauce to their own liking. This wasn't the case. The coating was good but not spicy. Next time, I definitely would up the amount of black pepper and cayenne added to the flour. You could hardly taste it.

This recipe did not work for me...I tried it according to the directions and the first pork chop ended up with no breading. I then tried coating them in egg first and this worked better. On the last one I double dipped (egg/batter/egg/batter) and ended up with a heavily coated one. Overall my husband and I did not like the taste and the results were pretty dissappointing.

These are pretty good! I love spicy food but honestly these arent as hot as I wouldve liked. For some reason when I fried the pork chops, the flour mixture fell off the chops. Now that I think of it, the chops were dry when I put them in the mixture. Oh well, these were still pretty good, may bake next time. Thanks!  :O)

This was quick and simple. What I liked about it was that I always like spicy and my partner has to be in the mood.  So I floured his chop using plain flour and then I added the spices to mine.  He had his with applesauce and I had sour cream on the side to cut down the heat after dipping the chop in the hot sauce!!!  Thanks submitter.

I made this recipe last night. I had to tweak it a bit because what i  had on hand and what i did/did not want to do with the meat. Instead of flour, i used panko bread crumbs and added chili powder(and all the other seasons suggested) to it too -it didn't affect the taste, not too spicy-spiciness came in with the red hot! I didn't fry them, i cooked them in the George Foreman grill.) It was awesome! Like eating buffalo pork chops - YUM!! I like it spicy!

I tried this recipe last night and I was amazed how good it was. Two of my neighbors asked what smelled so good. Easy to make and it had the right amount of heat. Very good change for pork chops.

I used gluten free panko breadcrumbs and 1 egg. I didn't double dip but I piled it on thick before dropping into olive oil on medium heat then turned it down after flipping on each side and also standing them on their side for at least one minute on each side. I also doubled the cayenne and like another reviewer I went for it, I dipped the chops in Franks completely after draining grease off on paper towel. My husband loved it and we will be using this on chicken breasts next time.   The panko was perfectly crunchy and not too thick despite how much I piled on. AWESOME!!

Basic but tasty. Not "teary eyed" as advertised. If you like mild spicy, this is for you.

Based upon the reviews, I doubled the amount of cayenne and black pepper to the flour mixture. I also seasoned the chops with salt and pepper prior to dredging them in flour. I also dredged them in egg and then in panko and then into the hot sauce let them sit a bit and then fried them absolutely fabulous !

This recipe has become a favourite for my hubby and I.  I usually up the cayenne pepper to 1 1/2 tsp because we love our spicy food.  I usually marinate the chops in Frank's Red Hot for a few hours as well to increase the heat factor even more!

Wonderful recipe. Cooked extremely well in the cast iron skillet. I followed the recommendations and doubled the black pepper and cayenne pepper, which spiced up the recipe to a perfect level. I also dipped the chops on egg prior to dipping in the breading. This allowed for the breading to adhere to the chop a bit better! Will be using this recipe again!
