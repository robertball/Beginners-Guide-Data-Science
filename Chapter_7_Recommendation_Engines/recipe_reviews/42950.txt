This is a great idea for a muffin, but as a former professional baker I think this recipe needs a little tweaking!  First, I added an egg and substituted the water for buttermilk.  Some previous users commented that the muffins appeared grayish-- the milk should solve this problem.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla extract to help the flavor-- not too much, you don't want to overpower the almond!  I used about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Hope that helps everyone, they turned out great for me!!

These muffins are great!  I used only 1tsp almond extract and be sure the raspberries are still frozen when you put them in the mix.  This will avoid the "gray" color.  Also just lightly fold the berries in.

I loved this recipie. Almonds are my favorite nut, and Raspberries are my favorite berry, so this is the perfect combination for me. Toasting the almonds really brought out the flavor. I added a bit more almond extract then called for, and they turned ot great. Thank you for sharing this recipie with us! I'll deffinetly be making it again and again. :)

The flavor of these muffins is wonderful!  I made them for myself for Mother's Day morning and the whole family loved the treat.  I'm back to get the recipe out again, I've thought of them often and keep craving them.  Really moist and good!  Thanks!

We have raspberry bushes in our backyard so I'm always looking for ways to use these.  I have four children, they loved the muffins.  I omitted the almonds (for the kids).  It was really delicious.  The almond flavoring was enough to make me feel like I was eating something adult.  This recipe was also very fast and easy.

Easy & excellent.  I made 12 muffins in a regular sprayed tin and baked at 375. They disappeared within hours after baking.  My friend used a combination of raspberries and blueberries, with the same yummy results. The inside color is a little grey, but it does not detract from the taste. I am being prodded to make them again.

Wonderful! All I did was change the water to buttermilk, doubled the recipe (it made 28 - filled muffin cups all the way), and used half raspberries/half blueberries (frozen - took them straight from the freezer, tossed them in flour to prevent too much leakage). Toasted the almonds...yum. They are just a lovely memory now; they went so fast! Hubby asked for these to be put into the permanent breakfast rotation.

I really loved these muffins but I gave it four stars because I followed some of the suggestions and tweaked the original recipe. Used milk instead of water and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I didn't add the additional almonds because I didn't have any almonds at home. I used 1 cup of sugar and sprinkled sugar on top too. Kids loved them. But I love the combination of almond extract and raspberries. Just remember to reduce the time for 12 regular sized muffins since the recipe is for 6 jumbo muffins--I forgot to do that. Oops!

So good! :D I blended my berries and used walnuts instead of almonds (it's what I had on hand). I'll be using this again in the  not so distant future. :D

This recipe is great.  These muffins are very easy to make and are very flavourful.  I used ground almonds rather than slices which worked very well.  In addition, I mixed fresh raspberries with fresh blueberries which tasted great! I think any fruit/berries would do well in a pinch.

This modified recipe turned out really yummy!  I didn't like the idea of adding water, so I happened to have almond milk on hand and used that instead.  I probably used a little more toasted slivered almond in the muffin, then sprinkled untoasted on the top which then lightly browned to perfection.  I halved the recipe, but used a full egg and a half cup of sugar.   I broke up the fresh raspberries I was using into pieces, which worked beautifully to spread out the color and flavor.  I baked them in a "muffin-top" pan for about 12 minutes.  Afterwards, just to go over the top, I make a cream cheese frosting (like a Cinnamon roll icing) to spread over the top.  Possibly the tastiest muffin I ever made!  :)

Ok...like most, I altered it. I was in a rush and didn't have butter softened so I used 1/4 cup of oil.  I also needed bran so I added 2/3 cup of bran buds and the same in oatmeal. They are very tasty and will give the family the extra fibre without them knowing!  ;)

Very nice. I took another reviewers advice and instead of water used buttermilk (1/2 plain yogurt & 1/2 milk. because really, who has buttermilk on hand!) 
I also added frozen mixed berries instead of just raspberries and it turned out wonderful! Toasting the almonds really brings out the flavor. I thought they were sweet enough with the berries.

These are very good breakfast muffins. After reading the other reviews I added a few spoonfuls of sugar to the fresh berries before I folded them in.  They are not super sweet, but my whole family liked them this way. I doubled the recipe because I had raspberries I needed to use up.  I substituted vanilla extract for the  almond extract and omitted the almonds only because I didn't have either and I wanted the muffins NOW!   I used 24 regular size muffin tins sprayed, and still had enough batter left over (after filling the tins 3/4 full)to make a tin of 12 mini muffins to which I added chocolate chips for my youngest.  This, of course, was yummy too! I will definitely make this again after I buy almonds and extract!

An OK muffin, but nothing really special.  My kids didn't care for them at all.  Seemed a little heavy, and without the raspberries, I don't think the muffin would have had much flavor at all.

I made these with what I had on hand so I substituted vanilla soy milk for the water, used light brown sugar, cake margarine, and vanilla essence. I don't have an oven, but they baked fine in my little toaster oven on the lower setting. My sweet eater loved them and so did I.  My little can't eat blueberries or raisins dude informed me that raspberries are on his list.  Will try to make a couple without next time.

I had a big bag of Costco Mixed Berries that I wanted to use up so I found this recipe.    I usually use whole wheat flour and apple sauce in all my bread/muffin recipes but I gave these a whirl.  They were very good and the whole family liked them.    I added a little turbinado sugar to the top before I baked them because I was worried they would be too tart.  I didn't have a problem with a grey muffin since my berries came straight from the freezer and I didn't over mix them.

I used the modification a couple of other users suggested of substituting the water for buttermilk. The muffins were really moist and had no "greyish tint". Another user recommended adding some cinnamon and vanilla extracts which I didn't do, but my try next time. The muffins were really good, but the extra flavor would make them even better!

These muffins are very good.  I did not find them too buttery like some said.  Yes, they were a little tart, but personally I liked that.  I loved the almonds in them - what a perfect combination!  I also liked that they were very quick and easy to make.  I'll definitely make them again!

This muffin recipe is VERY buttery, and because it has a low amount of sugar, it's almost like eating a shortbread muffin. I only used 1 tsp almond extract and added 1 tsp vanilla. I enjoyed these muffins, and I had to cook them a little longer to make sure they held their shape when they came out of the muffin tin. Even still, these muffins are very soft and delicious!

I thought these were pretty good.  They were awfully tart though.  I might try them again with half blueberries, half raspberries to offset the tartness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Satisfied my muffin cravings! It was gray. But it tasted good! And that's all that matters to me when it comes to baking. Of course, it is nice when things look appealing. But overall I was just happy to eat some raspberry muffins. :) I did add cinnamon and replaced the water with buttermilk.

Great recipe - substituted strawberries for raspberries since I needed to use up some strawberries. They came out great!

This is a great recipe. I did add an extra egg on suggestion of another reviewer- wanted my muffin to be more cake like and less bread like. Worked like a charm. Also- I had no graying when using my frozen berries. Next time though I’ll add more almond extract and skip the actual almonds as they didn’t add anything in my opinion. This is a keeper though!

My husband loves these muffins! Requests them often. They are simple to make and taste great. I seldom have almonds on hand but they turn out fine without them. Thank you for this great recipe.

I used yellow raspberries because that is what I had.  I used less sugar than called for, maybe 2-3 tablespoons less.  I also used regular size muffin tins, filling ten wells. The muffins were big and a light golden brown.  They are very good and I will make them again, but may use different berries.

These are soooo declicious- even my kids gave thumbs up!!  And they aren't big raspberry eaters.  I did add some vanilla and cinnamon and used milk instead of water.  I also added some yogurt I had to use up in the fridge and these came out sooo moist!!!  Loved Them!!

I made the recipe as presented -- no tweaking -- and wasn't wowed. The almond and raspberry flavors weren't exactly mixed and weren't exactly complimentary, and the texture was too dense.  Not awful but won't be making again.

Good muffin, nothing spectacular.  I'm going to try it again with ground almonds instead of the slivers, see if that helps develop a richer texture.

I read the comments and added some of the suggested extras to it after taste testing the original recipe ( it was too tart)-- I added vanilla, cinnamon, an extra egg, and buttermilk.

 I was very disappointed. 

It was unappetizing :( 

Big NOPE from me.

Fairly blah and rather tart. Think I will tweak the recipe next time and maybe add some orange zest and cinnamon.

Delicious! made them for my friends and they loved them! Wanted something different and these were the answer. If berries are even slightly thawed will turn the dough gray. Add raspberries very last before popping in the oven...CLFLYNN

wonderfull taste but strange colour, next time I'll try milk in stead of water.
I've just add some white chocolate chips, so sweet with raspberries.

Very simple, tasty muffin recipe.  I happened to have buttermilk on hand, so I did as one poster suggested and substituted it for the water.  The muffins turned out great--not gray!

Yummy!  My frozen raspberries were quite tart so I upped the sugar to one cup.  I also omitted the almonds to accommodate my elderly m-i-l who can't eat nuts.  Be sure to FOLD the FROZEN berries in so the muffins will be a lovely lemon color.

They came out blue!!  I won't make these again.  They came out good enough to eat, but something about the raspberries turning blue, just turned me off.

I tried the recipe as is and it was excellent. I did not think that they were to buttery as others suggested.  They were not sweet at all. I think that the sugar was just right. Although if you do like a sweet muffin, add another 1/4 cup of sugar or more berries. They did not last 5 mins out of the oven.  This batch made 12 small cupcakes so I would recommend doubling and freezing any leftovers.  They will warm up just fine in the microwave or toaster oven.

we LOVED these muffins.  I used less almonds, and shortening in place of the butter....just like from a bakery/coffee shop. (I also had to bake them slightly longer, so just test them before you take them out!)  Thanks!

I was very excited to make these muffins and am sorry to say that I had to dump them.  The flavors did not mesh well and it was just awful.  Dry, without flavor and a horrible gray color.

Since we didn't have almonds on hand, we made them without.  Still a very good muffin--hearty and moist.  My kids loved them!
