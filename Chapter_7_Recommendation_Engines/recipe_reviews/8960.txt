Holy vinegar! This ran me completely out of apple cider vinegar, and only put a cup in.    Even with toning down the vinegar, it was pretty much unpalatable.  No one would touch it except me (the vinegar lover) and even I had trouble with it.

I loved this recipe! I did make some changes though.  I was only cooking for two and used chicken tenders(about 8) instead of a whole chicken. I used 8oz. of tomato sauce and put about 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  My guy isn't really a vinegar guy, so I tamed it down using a little bit of sugar, some basil, and a dash of savory. Very tasty!! Thank you for this recipe!

This was an ok dish, it is good if I am short on time.  Next time, I will cut down the vinegar by 1/2.

The most nutritious vinegar is raw apple cider vinegar, and cooking destroys the beneficial enzymes. I like cooking this with less vinegar and adding some fresh raw vinegar at the end. (Raw apple cider vinegar can easily be used for a delicious salad dressing, with olive oil, mustard, etc.)

This recipe, I determined after cooking it for work one day, is basically chicken in homemade ketchup.  Not that it's bad, but I did throw in some spices and crushed red pepper just to spice it up a little.

This was really good and an easy, quick substitute for chicken cacciatore. It was very flavorful and the chicken was extremely tender and moist.

I really liked this.  My husband was less impressed (his comment?  Too vinegar-y... duh!).  But I will definitely make this again.  I think he can be persuaded ;)

Loved it!  I used 1 cup of apple cider vinegar with one pd. chicken for a large dinner for two. Loved it on Basmati or white rice. Used a little minced garlic. Nice tanginess! I liked the amount of vinegar!

This dish had an excellent taste. However, I would (unless you are a vinegar lover) cut the vinegar in half because it overpowers any other taste in the dish. At first it's wonderful but then the strong after taste sets in of vinegar. I did add some basil and sugar as well per another reviewer. Overall very good dish and the chicken was absolutely wonderful. Nice and tender.

This was a really good dish, but if I were you I would cut the vinegar down to half a cup. I like it the way it is but thats because I love Vinegar. I did add Fresh Garlic to taste (not garlic powder), 2 tablespoons of Brown Sugar( help's with the vinegar) large Purple Onion, and Fresh Mushrooms.  I will make this dish again very soon! :-)

I just didn't care for this. I like vinegar as much as the next person, but wow, that's all I could taste. To quote an earlier reviewer, "holy vinegar!"

Loved it! I love the tangy taste to it and served with white rice was delic! I will def be making this one again. I did change it up a little, I added less vinegar then the recipe asked for and I left all the juices from my chicken in the pot so it was really juicy! Thanks for sharing!

I love vinegar and so does my family...we did not care for this recipe. The vinegar was beyond too strong. It totally ruined the dish. I usually have very good results when I make recipes from this website, this was not one of them. NOT a keeper!!!

I cut the vinegar in half (raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar), bumped up the garlic a bit and served over steamed  brown rice.  Really enjoyed it, my boyfriend grated parmesan for his.

I used olive oil and 2 cloves of fresh garlic (which I sauteed with the onions).  I only put in 1/2 can of vinegar and after cooking for 30 minutes I took the lid off the pan and let it reduce a bit.  This was really good.  My husband and I just started a low carb diet and this was a perfect entree.

It was so so in flavor, wouldn’t make again.
