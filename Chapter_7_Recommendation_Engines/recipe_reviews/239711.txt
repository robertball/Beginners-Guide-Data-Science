This is a pumpkin pie like "cupcake" that is seen all over pinterest during the fall months. It is good but it is not cake like and there is nothing noting that this is not your typical pumpkin cake. The flavors of pumpkin pie are all there.

I did not care for the texture: too, too moist, just a little less than pumpkin pie itself. Used muffin liners, did
not remove easily, they stuck.

I did not care for this recipe. It was too moist and needs more flour in order to make it a cupcake.

These are good. They almost taste like mini pumpkin pies only not quite as sweet. I will bake them just a minute or two longer next time as they tasted slightly 'wet'. They do not taste or feel like muffins. I made a second batch for my daughter.  I used gluten free flour. They turned out good also.

these taste great but they are so moist; and when I took them out of the oven they had great height to them but add they cooled they sunk.
