This had good flavor but it had way too much liquid. I drained most of it off before serving.

I used a cheap cut of roast and cut them up into 1 in. pieces instead of the ground beef. The liquids made the meat really tender and it tasted great with tortillas and your favorite fillings.

It was good but could have been better. I reduced the ingredents to 1 pound of meat and 1 can of tomatoes and peppers. Plus I add a tsp of corn starch to thicken the gravy.

I found this recipe to be extremly easy. I just used a large skillet left out the meat tenderizer since I didnt have any and added some cumin and paprika for extra flavor. I didnt let it simmer for near as long as it said just till heated through then I served it on tortillas with my homemade guacamole and some sour cream. My husband really liked it and though I thought it was a little juicy it tasted fabulous. The only thing I'd change is to take the cover off the last few minutes and let the juices evaporate.

This was ok but not as good as I had hoped. Maybe because I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. I used 2 fresh tomatoes and a hot chili pepper instead of canned because some of the reviewers had suggested that there was too much juice. However I think next time I will try it with 3 tomatoes to get a bit more flavour.

I liked this not something I would serve for company but a great weeknight dish. I only used one pound of beef and added a little taco seasoning and did not simmer for as long as suggested but it still turned out great.

My family liked this taco. Even the grandkids ate the tacos. Next time I will blend the tomatoes only because the grandkids like it better that way.
