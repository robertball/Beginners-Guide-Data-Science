I'm Greek and I love this sauce-- I make it often.  The only thing I do different is that I use lots more garlic which is my taste of course.  Don't use the colander that some have suggested.  I cut up my cucumbers in a food processer and then place them in a small bowl with 6 layers of paper towels over the bowl, invert the bowl and then the cucumbers drain into the paper towels.  I also do the same thing with the yogurt--trust me it will work so no soupy sauce!  Also, make sure you mix the olive oil well into the yogurt then mix them together with the cucumbers!  If you have a garlic press, you will definitely need it with this recipe and if you don't have one--go buy one!!

great for gyros!  most sysco locations will let you "cash and carry" meats from their office.  I bought a box of gyro meat there, mmmmm just like the restaurants.  be creative!  I bought a pizza pie shell, added pizza cheese, slices of gyro, dolops of this sauce, baked it in the oven then put onion and lettuce on it when it came out of the oven.  FANTASTIC!! just like the sandwich..  this sauce will be made in my home again and again and again!

I can see the need for draining the cucumbers so much, although I followed the steps my dip was still a little runny, I have since searched the topic and found a recipe that drained the yogurt first (in cheesecloth).  I think I will try this next time, however the taste was fabulous, a little too garlicky for my kids, but my husband and I loved it.  Thanks

Absolutely fab!!!!!  Definitely drain your yogurt and cucumbers-- also another trick to keep it less soupy- mix the olive oil with the cucumbers (after draining of course)  this will keep the soupy part down because what is the soupy part is the olive oil mixing with the yogurt!  I love this recipe though and my family adores it on all sorts of things- baked potato, salad, chicken, with pita chips etc

This is excellent!  I really wanted a thick tzatziki so I drained the cucmbers and yogurt before using and then drained everything again after mixing it in the blender.  It tastes better after being in the fridge for a couple days.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe. I drained the yogurt and drained the cucumber for 1/2 an hour longer than called for, and my sauce was still fairly soupy. It was also a lot more "lemony" than any tzatziki I've ever tasted. An average recipe, but one I probably wouldn't make again.

The taste is good, but - as others have mentioned - it's way too soupy.  There should be some instructions for draining the yogurt with this recipe.  I wanted to use this as a dip for pita chips, but it doesn't stay on the chips very well.  :(  However, it would be good served over falafel in a pita sandwich, or as a salad dressing.  (I can see it paired with romaine lettuce, feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, more cukes...)

The flavor of this was very good, but the texture could be better; it was very thin after I processed it. My boyfriend, who used to work in a greek restaurant suggested that using a food processor might be making it thin. Next time I'll try hand whisking the oil and vinegar/lemon juice together before whisking in the yogurt and cucumber.

I like the sauce thicker too, but I simply use Plain Greek yogurt.  It is now readily available even at Krogers.  Thick with no draining time!

I followed Jennifer's suggestion for draining, with great success.  I just stuffed the cukes in my food processor, too.  She is right; it needs more garlic.  I used the 6 cloves, only 1/8 cup oil, and added a dash of dill with the other ingredients.

Way too liquid-y. The flavors were delicious, but my finished product had no thickness to it. As a result, not a very good dip for putting on a sandwich.

Too much garlic in my opinion, but other than that it was very tasty.  I used non-fat yogurt which made it a little extra tangy, which I really like.  Thanks for the recipe!

A really tasty recipe.  It took a while to get the yogurt & cucumber thoroughly drained, but the result was well worth it.  The garlic made it really zippy.  I thought less might be better, but I was told that it was great just as it is.

My husband and I both love this recipe!  The only change we make is to use Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt.  It's a little thicker and has a tangy flavor that you can't get with regular yogurt.

This is the  tzatziki recipe I always use. However, I use 1 teaspoon salt (1 tble must be a misprint), 2 tble vinegar, & 2 large garlic cloves. You've got to change it to your liking just like with every recipe.

Fantastic. I subbed sour cream for yogurt (out of yogurt), and shredded the cukes on a box grater. I think the secret is the fresh garlic. Delicious!

Love this stuff!  I used 2 cups of nonfat Greek yogurt - that will address half of the 'too runny' issue as greek yogurt is 'pre-drained'.  For the cucumbers, I shredded them in the food processor, dumped the shreds into a colander, squeezed out the moisture, and then rolled the shreds in paper towel.  That will address the other half of the moisture issue.  I added more garlic (personal preference), used less olive oil and omitted the white vinegar.  I whirled it in the food processor, then added the cucumber shreds, about 1 tsp of salt, and pulsed briefly to mix.  Chilled and served with pork souvlaki recipe from this site.  ALL gone!   Awesome!

This is just like what we at when we were in Greece!  I did make one change, just that I drained the yogurt with cheese cloth overnight. Also, make sure you drain the cucumbers as long as you can.  It gives the sauce a much better texture and consistancy.

This tzatkziki sauce comes out amazing every time. I use probably 6 cloves garlic, which is not for everyone, as it is quite sharp that way. But the resident garlic freak likes it, so I must be doing something right. I've made this on several occasions, and by memory after the first time, and I realized that I never use the olive oil. I really can't see any need for it. When I omit the olive oil it's cool and creamy, with a great yoghurt and garlic tang. I'm getting hungry for gyros and falafel drenched in tzatziki while writing this!

This Tzatziki was fabulous.  As other raters suggested you will need to drain the yogurt.  My sauce was very tasty but runny.

Really good flavor.  It was a LITTLE runny as others have said, but not too bad.  Be sure to salt the cucumbers and let it drain in a colander as per the instructions.  I think the salt helps draw some of the liguid out.

Way too runny for my taste.  I plan to try this recipe again but draining the yogurt at well as the cucumbers.  I will also put less garlic because it was too spicy for me. 

I made this recipe again, 2 weeks after the first time.  I drained the yogurt all afternoon and the cucumbers for 2 hours. It was still soupy and not at all the texture that I was looking for.  I will not be making this recipe again.

It takes a while for all the drying and draining, but it is a good recipe. Easy to modify by adding other herbs and spices too. I like to add fresh dill.

My husband and I loved the flavor profile of this sauce.  I didn't have issues with it being runny; I drained as much water from the cucumbers as possible (placed the shredded cucumbers in a cheesecloth and squeezed out the juice) and I used thick greek yogurt (you get similar effect if you drain regular yogurt in a cheesecloth).

I used the exact ingredients, with the exception of using greek yogurt instead of yogurt, but ignored the directions.  I quartered the cukes, deseeded them, then sliced them thinly with a mandolin.  Then put them in a colander with salt for a while, but I don't think it did much.  When I was ready to put it all together, I put the cucumber slices in a kitchen towel and squeezed hard - that worked.  I mixed all the other ingredients first, then stirred the cucumber slices in.  Put it in the fridge for a few hours, and upon taste testing it got the "put this in regular rotation" seal of approval from the husband.  It was absolutely not runny using this method.

An excellent tzatziki recipe; it was perfect to use as dip for souvlaki-type chicken kabobs.

This was really good served with the Naan recipe from this site. I rather like the cucumber yogurt sauce the goes with the Warm Pitas with Turkey and Yogurt Cucumber Sauce found on this site, but this sauce was very good as well.

I drained the cucumbers as suggested, but didn't read the reviews ahead of time to drain the yogurt... it was super runny and very messy, but the flavor was good.

Excellent.  My  family loves this. I Marinate chicken and put in on pita bread with extra cucumbers and onions and add this sauce.  An easy dinner.

I made this last weekend, and it was pretty good. Not exactly what I was looking for, but tasty just the same. I think that the olive oil overpowered it just a little. I was looking for something a bit smoother.
