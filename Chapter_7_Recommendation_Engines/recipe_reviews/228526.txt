This is a refreshing dish that only those who are sensitive to gluten will care that it is gluten free. I added some fresh hot peppers to spice it up. Leave it to sit for an hour or so to help the flavours get acquainted. Thank you for the recipe.

MMMM. Really good Kasha recipe. Would be even better with tomatoes (I skipped out b/c of allergies in the family). Will definitely be making again. Thanks!

I was very excited to make this salad.I didn't like the  smell of buckwheat,when I cooked it.  So, I changed my mind.
