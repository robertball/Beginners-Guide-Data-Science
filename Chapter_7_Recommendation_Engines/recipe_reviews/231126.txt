This tasted great.  However, I thought this made too much dressing for the amount of the other ingredients.  You could probably cut the amount of the dressing in half.  Since I only had regular corn instead of Mexican corn, I added chopped red bell pepper and jalapeños to imitate the Mexican corn.  The only thing is it is a very pretty dish.  So I think the name does not apply.  Proudly serve this dish for any occasion.

I entered this recipe in an appetizer contest.  Out of approx 30 entries ....yep, won first place!  The apple cider vinegar is a must.  I also used a good amount of cilantro and of course I have never gone wrong with extra feta ??.   Make 24 hours before serving. ( do not add feta till ready to serve)

I have made this recipe several times with a couple of changes.  For this amount of dressing, I also mix in a can of kidney beans, I only use 1 TBL of sugar and I add in 1 TSP of salt to balance out the sugar.  If I don't have chives, I use red onions and I like to add cilantro when I have it.

The ingredients sound like a weird combo but this was delicious!  Also like someone else commented I used half the ingredients for the dressing part which was plenty. I also used Splenda to lower calories too.

Can't believe more people haven't tried this!  A friend of mine has been making this for years and it's always a hit. I took it to a get-together last year and was requested to bring it again this year. Weird combination but it's positively addicting.  I disagree that it's too much dressing, I think it's perfect. You can experiment with different oils and vinegars, they're all good.

I made a batch to take to a BBQ party and everyone tried a bit of it but no one really cared for it.  It definitely has a distinct taste; none of the flavors really seemed to work together.  Thanks for a different idea but we won't have this again.

Ive made this 2 ways... 1. Using White vinegar & regular block cheese. 2. Using Apple cider vinegar. The 1st way with the white vinegar is MUCH better. The Feta falls apart & gets gross. Cube tiny pieces of block cheese and you will absolutely become addicted. Also, use frozen corn or better yet, fresh cooked corn cut off the cob.

I didn’t have apple cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead.  I also replaced the green onions w red onions.  I HAD to add avocado (lightly tossed w lemon juice and olive oil) and chopped jalapeños - because I LOVE them in almost anything - and it was so yummy!  Got lots of compliments and it was all gone!

I first tried this when a friend brought it to a pot luck. Since then, everyone there who tried it has made it. We always request she bring it anytime we get together.  Anytime I have taken it anywhere, the bowl is always emptied by the time we leave. It is delicious! I read the review where someone took it to a bbq and no one liked it. I have to question if something went wrong with an ingredient, because everyone I have ever seen try this dip has come back for 2nds or even 3rds

Love this recipe. We eat it as a salad. I did half the olive oil and added salt, pepper, and a shake a garlic powder.

Delicious! I used Stevia in place of sugar and felt it was a little too sweet. I’ll cut the sugar in half. I added a little salt and more vinegar to cut the sweetness. Next time I’ll start with 1/2 of the sugar it calls for. I used regular canned corn, added red pepper and pickled jalapeños. This is really good!

I did as other people suggested and made half of the dressing and it was really delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.

I've made a very similar salad for years using Allison House dressing, a locally produced (Omaha) apple cider vinaigrette. I have increasingly been having trouble finding it in stores so went looking for an alternative dressing. This is it. I went a little lighter on the sugar and a little heavier on the cider vinegar and it is spot on. I like to serve it with blue corn chips and it is always praised at parties and is nearly always polished off. It tastes great the next day but if I'm making it for a party I don't like to prep it too far in advance as it won't look as fresh and pretty--and definitely don't add the feta until serving time. NOTES: I use plain corn and fresh bell pepper. I have always used red onion. I'm sure it's good with green, too, but old habits die hard :)

I'd make it again. It was a big hit. We don't eat a lot of sugar so I used 1T of honey instead.  I also added 1 t salt.

I will make again, with the same edits I used the first time.
--used lime infused white balsamic vinegar and grapefruit olive oil (reduced quantities by about half per other reviewers)
--used jalapeno feta
--cut the corn directly off the cob since we had some on hand from the garden
--added garden cherry tomatoes, cut in half or quartered
--added half of each yellow and green bell peppers
--omitted the sugar
--added cilantro (not my personal favorite, but I figured it would add to the dish as it is a common ingredient for this dip)
Turned out great!  4 stars because you absolutely don't need as much dressing as it calls for!

I liked this well enough, but it is a little sweet. I only added 2 tsp of sugar, and I think that was almost took much. I took the advice of another review and halved the dressing, but wound up adding white vinegar for more bite.

A friend served this to me as a side dish and I loved it.  I made it today to take to a cookout as a side.  I followed the recipe exactly, then read the recipe reviews while it was in the fridge.  I drained off the extra liquid before serving - over 1/3 cup!  The dish was a hit but will use less EVOO/sugar/apple cider vinegar next time.

Best snack dip EVER.  We call this crack dip and it always disappears at parties or even just at my house in the summer.  It does make a lot of dressing but some  people like the soaked stuff at the end.

By coincidence we had all ingredients on hand when looking for a quick snack with guests over so gave it a try. Thought there may be leftovers based on the volume made but with only 4 people and some other meat & cheese tapas, every bit of it disappeared!  Maybe the only thing we would change is scale back the sugar a bit, and add some fresh cilantro.  So good!!

Easy and delicious. Used a yellow onion instead of green. Might try less sugar next time.  Added diced tomatoes.

This is a great recipe!  I did add a little bit of garlic powder and used reg. white corn.  Very good!!  Great as a salad or as a dip with fritos or scoops....very good.
