Excellent excellent excellent!  This was my first turkey ever and I cooked for 20 people a 26 ponud bird...!  I double the recipe and it was fabulous!
Everyone raved at how good it and the stuffing was.  I was affraid it might be too sweet but not at all!  Also, Iwas worried that the cinnamon in the raisin bread might be too much, but again It was great. 
Even my guests who don't like raisins loved this stuffing, so don't be affraid to try it.

This had great flavor.  I was looking for something a little different from the traditional and this was perfect.  That being said, I don't know how thick the bread slices are supposed to be, but some of the ingredient amounts seemed off. I used 12 thin slices which was almost the whole little loaf.  There were way too many cranberries, and too much onion.  I used maybe 3/4 cup onion, and added 1 stalk of celery.  The liquid amount was perfect though.  Will definitely use this again.  **11/08 Update:  I now use this recipe as a base and love it.  I use half raisin bread and half cube stuffing mix, which cuts a bit of the sweetness.  I add celery, use less onion, and a small amount of dried cranberries instead of all those fresh/frozen cranberries.

Very good-- it has that nostalgic tase of stuffing I remember from Thanksgivings at grandma's house, but with a classy, fruity twist.  I used fresh cranberries and instead of using raisin bread, I used whole wheat bread and added raisins-- it's wonderful, they plump up and get soooo juicy!  I had some problems with it drying out and had to add water frequently.  The first time I made it, I used it to stuff a pumpkin, but the second time I made it as a dish all its own.  Fantastic!

I have made this stuffing every year for the past three years for our office thanksgiving dinner. I am now expected to make it because it is so well liked by the staff.

I read the reviews but decided to go ahead and pretty much follow the way this recipe is written.  The only deviations I made were to use 1/4 cup butter and chicken broth (it's what I had in the fridge) rather than vegetable.  Honestly, I tasted it before putting the dish into the oven, and I had major concerns that it was going to be too sweet.  However, the tartness of the cranberries (I have a couple bags frozen) balances out the sweetness perfectly IMO.  Just a couple comments.  If you have access to "ground rosemary," I'd recommend you use it.  My husband said the rosemary tasted a little like "sticks."  Also, I will cut the chopped onion and cranberries back to about a cup each in the future.  Many people only make stuffing for Holidays, but it's a nice side dish any time of year, even during the dog days of August.  Thanks, Ibby, we enjoyed your stuffing served with pork chops, and probably will make it again for Thanksgiving adding some sausage and maybe a little chopped celery.

Thanks for the posted comments - they were very helpful. Not one morsel of this side item was left in the casserole dish when I made it Thanksgiving Day and several dinner guests complimented me on its flavor. Here's how I amended the recipe: only 1 cup of diced onion, 1/4 cup of butter, 3/4 cup dried cranberries, about 8 slices of cinnamon raisin bread (cubed and toasted), and about 6 slices of whole-wheat bread (cubed and toasted). Everything else was the same. I baked it separately from my lemon and rosemary stuffed turkey and it was fabulous.

I thought it was delicious as did most of my guests.  One thought it was a bit sour with the cranberries.  I doubled the recipe and found out I had more liquid than bread cubes.  The reason was that I used a relatively thin sliced bread.  I ended up using about 30 thin slices vs. 24 what the doubled recipe called for.  Came out moist and flavorful overall.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and received good reviews from my guests. It is a delicious stuffing but I think next time I will cut the raisin bread in half with pumpernickel for a little less sweet. The recipe is easy, too!

Excellent stuffing!  I have used fresh and dried cranberries- both work well.  I have made it for a few years, and people always request it and rave about it.

Every year for Christmas I make this stuffing.  People in my family who don't like stuffing eat this great dish.  Very good indeed!

I adjusted according to what I had.  I used 1 c diced onions and 1 c diced celery, used 1 1/4 c dried cranberries and added a little dried savoury,  I did not have raisin bread so used a mix of sour dough and calabrese and a couple of dashes of cinnamon.  I like traditional stuffing but wanted a change and this was perfect.

I didn't make this stuffing but it was made by a friend last year.... I loved it and I usually don't like stuffing. So this year I asked her for the recipe and she gave me the link for it.  I have  question. Can the liquid mixture be made a couple days in advance and then added to the  raisin bread the day of thanksgiving, then bake? I'm making dinner for 50 family members so anything I can do in advance helps.

Made according to directions but was pretty tart for my taste and turned out very dry. If I make it again will add more vegetable stock and less cranberries. Recipe did not mention when to add bread crumbs.
