I used wonton wrappers. They were a big hit at the party. Fried up very quickly in the wonton wrappers.

This are really easy to whip out.  After trying the first time, I now make a point to make double or triple batches so that I always have some handy in the freezer to cook up in a snap.  Do make up the jalapeno sauce, it is fantastic with these and lots of other things!

Made them for visiting family and they loved them.  Not too difficult to make.  It is kind of meaty and fried for breakfast but I guess that is up to personal taste
