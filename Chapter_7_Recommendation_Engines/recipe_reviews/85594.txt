An excellent base recipe for plain biscuits. If you're looking for something cheesy, spicy, or otherwise flavored, you'll have to either use a different recipe or modify this one. (I'm on a crusade to get people to critique a recipe according to its intended purpose!)

I made a couple procedural changes that may help with the final product. First, I always find it helpful to sift the dry ingredients three times in order to fully incorporate them, especially the baking powder (one reason some folks may have trouble with "tasting" the baking powder).

Secondly, I did take issue with the two minute kneading. Far too long for biscuits... you'll activate the gluten and wind up with a more bread-like texture. The biscuit standard is twelve turns, but you develop a feel for when the dough is holding together, sometimes you'll need a couple more or less.

Finally, I roll my dough out into a rectangle and cut it into squares with a knife. This saves time, and eliminates the need to re-roll scraps--which will always be less tender than the first rolled.

Wow, this was very good.  I never make biscuits because they always seem so dry, not these!  One thing I did do was freeze the stick of butter and then grate with a box grater (I saw this on a cooking show).  That way the butter stays nice and cold for a nice tender biscuit.  Plus it mixes much easier with the dry ingredients.  Will definately make this again!

The best biscuits!!!  I used half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 tsp salt.  Let the cut biscuits sit for 10-15 minutes before baking and they will be VERY tall and light!

Ok Here goes my tips.  First of all, this is an excellent recipe.  This is the recipe I will use from now on.  Tips 1.  Sift the dry ingredients together. 2. Put butter in freezer to harden then grate onto the dry ingredients (from another poster) 3.  Use more than 3/4 cup buttermilk.  I use at least 1 cup because it helps the ingredients incorporate better and is easier to knead when its not so dry. 4. After kneading I roll into a rectangle and cut with a pizza cutter into about 12 square biscuits.  5. Please cut squares on pan right next to each other and let rest for at least 15 minutes 6.  I bake on a insulated cookie sheet at 375 with the dough squares right next to one another.   ***Update***** You can actually freeze these biscuits.  I make a double batch.  Roll them out, cut them into squares and lay cut dough on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  Then transfer the semi hardened biscuits in freezer bags and just bake them on an as need basis.

I've made this recipe several times now, so it's about time I review it. I always follow the recipe exactly and have never been disappointed with the results. I used to use a buttermilk drop biscuit recipe because I hate rolling out the dough and cutting out biscuits, and they always end up tougher in texture than I want. Whoever invented this method of baking buttermilk biscuits is a genius. Pure and simple genius. Minimal kneading (I usually don't do it as long as the recipe states--just until it's all mixed together), pat it into a square, cut the squares and pop it in the oven. They come out tender, flaky, moist, and delicious. Plus, it is SO easy to mix them up and bake them off just before your meal is done--it takes almost no time or effort whatsoever. The best tasting biscuits I have ever had and the easiest, most ingenious recipe I've come across in quite some time. Try these! They are fabulous. So, thank you for posting this recipe!!

September 2008: Perfect! I've made these biscuits w/o making any changes to the recipe. The only change I have made is that I grate the cold butter. I do that for all of my bread/crust recipes because, this way, it is a lot less time consuming to get the right texture. These taste similar to the Pillsbury packaged "Country biscuits" but much, much better for you! We eat these about once a week at my house. 

------------------------- 

Update: (December 2008) Because I make these so often I always keep buttermilk in the fridge, but this time I was out *Gasp*. I substituted homemade using vinegar as suggested by some reviewers... ew. This batch of "homemade buttermilk" biscuits were so gross. To get the 5 star flavor its imperative that you use real buttermilk!! No substitutions.

Okay, I LOVE biscuits and am always trying new recipes. I think these are the best ones I've ever tasted! They have a thin crispy shell on the top and bottom , are moist and golden inside and have the perfect texture.
I didn't have buttermilk so substituted 1TB vinegar then filled measuring cup to the 3/4 line. I also accidentally added 1/2tsp salt instead of a dash. 
My search for the perfect biscuit is over! I can't wait to eat the 2 I stashed away with jam in the morning :)

Aside from adding a half teaspoon of salt I prepared these just as the recipe directs, being careful not to overwork the dough.  I don't make biscuits often, so I doubt it's my biscuit expertise that produced these soft, tender, light as a feather biscuits.  I'm sure the buttermilk has a lot to do with it but obviously so does this recipe.  I love biscuits, Hubs could take 'em or leave 'em - but this recipe changed his mind.  I think he decided that after he polished off the second one.

I like this recipe.  I however did not knead for 2 minutes.  Instead I kneaded for about 30 seconds, and then patted the dough into a rectangle before cutting into 12 pieces.  they came out nice and flaky.

This recipe has rescued me from the biscuit hell I have known my whole life.  Finally delicious success!  I used a small food processor to mix the dry ingredients and processed the cut cold butter in.  I used soy milk with a little vinegar for homemade buttermilk.  I kneaded them and rolled them out and cut them as directed.  Next time maybe some brushed butter on the tops. Thanks.

For starters, I haven't found a good biscuit recipe. I have tried recipe after recipe.  I read the reviews before making this one. I did put 5 TBLS butter into the freezer (as some said). I grated the butter into the sifted bakng powder, soda, salt and sugar. I added the 2 cup of all purpose flour to the sifted ingred. I did use 1/2 tsp salt, as others mentioned. I used 1 cup of buttermilk. I did not knead for 2 minutes. As some said, only knead a few times. I didn't uderstand the part of cutting into squares. I used the rim of a drinking glass to make round biscuit form and used all the dough. I put them on my cookie sheet  and let it rest for 15 min, as others said. I baked at 350 degrees for 12 min. I kept a close eye on them. They did rise a little. If you want them tall I suggest rolling out 6x6 per the instrustions Mine were flat 'cuz I rolled it thin. I ate one and it was very tasty. I could taste the butter in it. The texture was very good; flaky on the inside crisp on outer layers and very moist. I found my biscuit recipe but did modify it a bit. Next time when I make this I'll sift the flour too. Hope Cookin4my3boys don't mind me modifying the recipe

This was an excellent recipe.  Very easy and delicious.  It was even great the next day when toasted in toaster oven.  I used milk with 2 1/2 tsp. lemon juice because I had no buttermilk handy.  I will be sure to use this recipe over and over again.

I made these to go with the Cordon Bleu dinner I'm making. No changes made to the recipe. I did pat the dough into an 8 in. circle, then cut the dough into six pieces, almost scone-like. This way, I prevented overworking the dough. I'll update my review after the boys try them.

I've made these biscuits for almost 20 years.  I add a little more than a dash of salt and a little more than a Tb of sugar.  I also cut them out with a cutter and bake about 16-18 minutes on 375 or until browning begins.  I use them for shortcake, sausage gravy (less sugar) or just for dinner.  The trick is not to work the dough anymore than necessary, I think 2 minutes is quite excessive.  I've won a blue ribbons several times with these!

Super easy & fast -I love these biscuits every time I make them!  They are tender inside with a nice crust on the top & bottom -just perfect!  I sub vinegar & milk for the buttermilk, cut in the butter with my hands & just mix the whole thing in a large bowl by hand just until it holds together & there is no noticeable dry flour (I don't knead it).  I usually double the recipe but only use 3/4c butter with no noticeable difference.  I pat it out on a piece of parchment paper & brush the tops with a little milk & bake for 18 minutes.  Sometimes I brush the tops with melted butter when I take them out of the oven.  We love them with gravy, jam or just plain!  If I am making breakfast for company, I mix everything in advance except the buttermilk & store it in the fridge so the butter stays cold.  In the morning I add the liquid, mix it, pat it & pop it in the oven so I'm able to focus on the rest of the menu.  This is my go to biscuit recipe  Thank you!

These were excellent, I used unsalted butter and upped the salt to 1 tsp, if using salted I would follow the recipe.  For years I have believed that you are supposed to handle the dough as little as possible, but I have recently learned that a quick 15 second kneading makes a smooth dough that develops just enough gluten so they can have the structure to rise high, I always skipped this before being afraid of tough biscuits and no matter how much baking powder used, they still came out flat (but tasty and tender), now just the 2 1/2 tsp of baking powder in this recipe, I get a tall beautiful, picture perfect biscuit.  I patted the dough out and cut them the traditional way as opposed to the way it is written in the recipe.  This is a nice no nonsense recipe.  I usually don't have buttermilk, so I sour some regular milk with a bit of vinegar or lemon juice, with great results.

These are the most amazing biscuits.  Light, tender, delicious.  I didn't need butter with them - they're amazing with grape jelly.

I mixed with my hands, cutting the butter into small cubes first then pinching it into the flour, and then I only mixed 12 turns after the ball of dough started to come together.

I cut into 16 with a pizza cutter.  They were crunchy on the bottom, tender in the middle - the only thing I would have changed is next time I'll brush them with a little butter so that they brown a bit on top and leave that sweet salty taste on top.

Thank you for this awesome recipe - yum!

I and my husband consider me to be a good cook. Generally, though, I am not good at biscuits, but this recipe changed that!!! I made these after church yesterday to go with a pork roast that I had slow cooked. My meal was delicious!! My husband ate 3 at his meal and then went back and got 2 more. I am sure these biscuits will be made often in my house. I was very pleased with this recipe and did not change a thing.

I love these biscuits. They come out nice and fluffly. If you like butter flavored biscuits you will really like these. Very easy to make. I always double the recipe and I drop them by tablespoons onto a baking sheet for the traditional round biscuit.

I made these biscuits last night to top my beef pot pie. I used half butter and half olive oil (we're health conscious) and ommitted the sugar. Then I dropped the batter by spoonfuls onto the casserole. Baked according to the pot pie's instructions, these came out so delicious and flaky and fluffy! Not at all like the recipe I used previously from the Joy of Cooking book (those were like hard lumps). I will definitely be making these again!

Quick and easy biscuit recipe.  Will make a butter colored biscuit.  I like that there is no wasted dough or rolling as the biscuits are cut into a square shape.  Also, they are made with butter as I always have on hand instead of vegetable shortening.  I also don't have buttermilk on hand and make a mock buttermilk recipe with milk and vinegar.  Works just fine with this recipe. a good biscuit!

Was a great biscuit, needed about a cup more flour so it would roll out and not be gooey. Didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but that may be due to my high altitude. Overall I liked this biscuit, it had great flavor and was not tough.

Like others, I'm really torn between rating a 4 or 5.  For taste, I'm rating a 5, but they weren't the biscuits I was expecting, so for my own records am lowering to a 4.  Made as directed, except for grating butter and minimizing kneading time.  Next time (as I *will* remake), will let rest for 10 minutes and will probably cut out and bake touching one another.  Taste is simply superb - very butter and flaky, but will also try 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, as they are extremely moist and crumble easily...

This is the best biscuit recipe I have ever tried!  Everybody in the family loved them.  They turned out soft, flaky, and rich.  I think my husband ended up eating six of them!

I love this recipe- it is really the only biscuit recipe I use anymore.  DO NOT KNEAD FOR TWO MINUTES- I actually knead them in the bowl until the dough holds together.  Then I press into a square pan and cut with a knife into the desired size.  These are really great, plain, simple biscuits-- great with anything... we're having them with sausage gravy tonight!

This is now my family's favorite biscuit recipe.  They came out nice and flaky.  I love the fact that it uses real butter as opposed to hydrogenated fats (Crisco) that so many biscuit recipes use.  Instead of using 100% all-purpose flour, I used part freshly ground whole wheat flour AND all-purpose flour - (1/2 cup whole wheat 1-1/2 cups white).  Next time I will make sure my "dash" of salt is a couple dashes.  

Thanks so much for posting this great recipe!

I just made my first pan of these biscuits, i have been trying to make biscuits for years and no matter what i do they always come out like frizzbies, not so with these babies!!, they raised so nice and they were really tasty, the only thing i did different was  add 1 extra tbsp of sugar, it made a difference in the taste a bit, a wonderful recipe, good bye pancake looking biscuits and hello skyscrapers!! Give  these a try you will love them.

Outstanding! We have been searching for the perfect buttermilk biscuit recipe for quite some time and this is it! Like another reviewer noted, there is a wonderful thin, crispy top and bottom that I haven't experienced with a shortening-based biscuit. We thought these were just wonderful!

Delicious.  I used a food processor to speed it up.  I think if I make them for dinner again (to go with soup as I did tonight) I'll cut back on the sugar.  They were a bit sweet for my taste but the kids loved them.  As is, these would be better for breakfast with jam or honey.

Umm, YUM!!!  So tasty and easy!  Needed a little extra buttermilk.  Didn't knead or roll out, just stirred together and formed on the pan.  Definite family hit.

These were easy and tasted good. They need more than a dash of salt though- I would add 1/4 tsp. and my baking time was 25 minutes. The middle was undone at 15 minutes. Flaky tops. Nice recipe.

I have tried for a long time to make buttermilk biscuits and they either didn't rise or was hard. these biscuits were very moist and fluffy. Absolutely delicious. I put garlic and melted butter on top and my my my. I loved that you didn't have to use a biscuit cutter.

Great basic recipe! I didn't have buttermilk, or even milk, actually. I used fat-free half & half and added 2 teaspoons of vinegar. I'm sure they'd be even better with real buttermilk. I lowered the temp to 375 after reading other reviews. Definitely making again.

The texture of this biscuit was perfect: flaky in the middle, nice crisp bottom and top.  It was also super easy to make.  I did up the salt amount to 1/2 tsp. and since I didn't have butter I used margarine.  I made my own buttermilk with milk and cream of tartar.  I also brushed the tops with milk before cooking and some melted margarine after cooking.  They were in the oven for 19 minutes, since at 15 they didn't look quite all the way done, but by 19 they were the perfect color and doneness.  My only tiny (in very small letters) complaint was that I was hoping it wouldn't taste so much like it came from a box mix.  But they were still very tasty and easy to make, I'm keeping this recipe for sure!

This recipe is wonderful! I am vegan, so I subbed coconut oil for the butter and soy milk with one tsp apple cider vinegar (let sit and turns into "buttermilk") for the buttermilk - followed the rest of the instructions exactly and the biscuits were perfect! Thanks :)

Delicious!  This is biscuit perfection! I have long been in search of the perfect biscuit- this is it! Taking the advice of others here, I froze the butter and grated it. Also, I didn't knead the dough for 2 minutes. Tonight I made them topped with a blue cheese/garlic butter and baked them in mini quiche dishes....heavenly!

I was on the fence about whether to give these 4 or 5 stars, but my kids said to give them 5. These were really easy to make and came out very good, but they do need more salt in my opinion and the kneading time should be cut down. Like other reviewers, I knead my biscuit dough only 12 times, or until the dough holds together. I made these Christmas morning as the dough for pigs in blanket, instead of crescent rolls. They were a good, fast substitute (they were about 1/4 the work of crescent rolls).

These were GOOD. The first time I made them, I used 2/3 cup of buttermilk (which wasn't really buttermilk, anyway; it was a little less than 2/3 cup milk + 1 tbsp vinegar) but the second time I did it right with the same mix for buttermilk. Yum yum. I ate all of 'em...that was my food for the day. It was YUMMY.

Absolutely, hands down the best biscut I have ever had. Both my husband and son loved them; we ate them all!  As per previous reviews, I made a couple changes. 1. I use unsalted butter for everything, so I added a scant teaspoon of sea salt. 2. I used the juice of one lemon and canned evaporated milk to make 3/4 cup of buttermilk. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are fabulous! I have tried multiple biscuit recipes that all seemed to turn out mediocre to dry, but I was VERY impressed with these. They are quick and simple - not a lot of fuss - and are sooo good! They rise a lot for biscuits, have a buttery, crispy "crust", and are soft and flaky on the inside. I used Earth Balance butter which worked great, kneaded only until blended, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

I made these for breakfast, biscuits and sausage gravy with fried potatoes and scrambled eggs, I doubled the recipe for 7 people and there were no leftovers! Everyone loved them! I did use a cheap cheese grater for the butter before cutting in and worked great! Thanks for sharing!!!

These were okay biscuits. I almost always fix a new recipe as written the first time.That being said, I feel that they need a tad more salt in them. Also they were very short and crumbled in hand sending crumbs everywhere. I plan to give them another try with a little more salt and just a little less butter. It was an interesting way to form them but I may fix them in rounds next time. All-in-all not really a bad biscuit.

I finally found a biscuit that I can make and be proud of. I only kneaded for a minute, just until everything was combined and the dough came together. This is a great recipe, very similar to the taste and texture of KFC.

WOW. I made a few changes to this recipe but the end result was FABULOUS. I'm not sure if my changes made any difference but I honestly thought one reviewer was just exaggerating when she said that these biscuits tasted like our favorite chicken restaurants' biscuits. SHE WAS NOT EXAGGERATING! These biscuits with my alterations taste about identical to those restaurant biscuits. THE BEST! I've tried at least 4 biscuit recipes previously and was getting ready to give up on making better-than-canned biscuits from scratch , but decided to give it another try with this recipe. I took a TB away from a stick of butter, and put a TB of cold bacon grease in its place.  I used about 3/4ths a teaspoon of salt instead of a pinch. I also put 1TB of white vinegar in a measuring cup and filled it the rest of the way with regular milk to the 3/4th cup line, let it sit for 5 minutes and presto, buttermilk! (I don't keep real buttermilk on hand very often)  I came out with the most flaky, moist tender DELICIOUS biscuits IN THE WORLD! TRY THIS RECIPE, IT WILL BE THE LAST BISCUIT RECIPE YOU TRY!! 

UPDATE: I've made this recipe MANY times now!  I will never get tired of them! LOL PERFECT for making breakfast sandwiches! Freezing the butter makes no difference as long as it's cold, honey can easily replace the sugar (I ran out once) & I find I get the best texture when I cut the butter into the flour mixture JUST until there are STILL pea-sized pieces of butter in there. ENJOY!

This was so easy to make! I've never made homemade biscuits before but decided to give it a try! I was impressed! My husband said they were a little bland, & I agree they were a tad bland...but aren't all biscuits?!! Maybe adding a little more butter in them would give them more of a buttery taste? Although I would definitely make these again! The only change I kinda made was making my own buttermilk cause I didn't have any! I used milk & lemon juice & they tasted fine!

I'm moving to Kentucky! These biscuits are good! Made them this morning with eggs and sausage - served with strawberry jam and the Cinnamon Honey Butter from this site. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make these again.

i have to say these are by far the best biscuits ive made. i made them exactly how the recipe states and they came out perfect. very light moist and flavorful! only thing i added was a lil garlic butter on top of them while they were baking. even my 10 month old son loved them! im gonna keep this recipe printed out and make them. i paired it with sausage gravy i found on this site and it was a match made in heaven!

Flaky, easy, tasty!  I have bombed with biscuits before, and so far I've made this twice and they've been great both times.

I followed all the tips (used buttermilk - no substitutes), grated the butter, let them sit a few minutes, etc before baking.  Still, I thought they were bland and not so great for all the effort!  Not sure I'll make them again.

Wonderful!  They taste exactly like the biscuits at my favorite restaurant in the Adirondacks.  They were easy to make and tasted great.  I highly recommend this recipe (with no changes - it's great as is)!

This biscuit recipe is really great!  I would give it 4.5 stars as written.  The only thing I will change the next time is to add a bit more salt.  It seems that using the same amount of salt as baking soda is a good rule of thumb.  Otherwise, I love the idea of patting it out on the pan and using a knife to separate them!  It kept them from getting tough - they were tender and flaky and delicious!  And I love another user's idea of freezing and grating the butter!  I didn't have any frozen so I grated it cold.  It works, but not as well.  After making this, I immediately put two sticks of butter in the freezer so I can have it handy the next time I make biscuits or pancakes.  Also, I have been culturing my own buttermilk thanks to an ebay listing and it is phenomenal!

Definitely a keeper!  I followed other suggestions to add 1/4 tsp salt and I used skim milk soured with vinegar.  I also used my food processor to cut the butter into the dry ingredients and then drizzled the milk into the mixture until it barely stuck together in the food processor bowl.  I then turned the mixture out on to the counter and pressed it into a rectangle, cutting into squares and then slightly forming each square into a circle before putting it on the pan.  The results were excellent and the biscuits melt in your mouth.

Wow. I've been looking for an easy biscuit recipe for a long time- but I think I've finally found it. These biscuits were easy to make and they turned out INCREDIBLY GOOD. They are flakey, buttery, and they don't last long. They remind me of the biscuits you get at Popeye's- only waaaaaayyyy better. One suggestion I have that I gleamed from my experience baking pie crusts is that you're biscuits will turn out flakier if you use cold butter. I cut my ice cold butter in using my food processor and I think that helped these biscuits achieve all of those buttery, flakey layers.

I've tried several biscuit recipes on this site and each has been OK but this one BEATS any others hands down.    First this was so much easier than  rolling cutting and re rolling and cutting to form biscuits, a lot of work for me.    Now easier is great but only if the food taste great. Well these were delicious. They were light brown and slightly crunchy outside and fluffy soft inside with a buttery taste.    I needed to bake them longer than written but that of course has more to do with oven variations.   Honestly I won't be looking any further for our perfect quick dinner biscuit recipe. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE;I've made this recipe so often I've had a chance to tweak it some. Here's what I've tried. After mixing original recipe mix in 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, drop by large spoonfuls onto pizza stone. Bake a minute longer. Perfect cheese biscuits! I also use fresh ground wheat flour now and these are still delicious!

A very easy recipe. I added white vinegar to make buttermilk, and it was great. Just add 1 tsp per cup of milk and let sit for 5-10 minutes. Easily tripled this for a large family.

OMG. OMG. OMG. These are marriage proposal worthy. These are THE best biscuits I've ever eaten in my life. As suggested by other reviewers DO NOT knead for 2 minutes. The less the dough is handled the better. I don't think I'll ever use another recipe for biscuits again.

OK - this is the best biscuit recipe ever!!! It was so easy, everything from start to finish in 20 mins. I didn't have the instrument to cut the butter so I just used beaters which made the whole process all the more easy. My husband looooved them, they will be a regular at Sunday morning breakfast from now on!!

Made as directed. Excellent taste and rise, but I did have to bake them an additional few minutes. They rose a LOT- next time I will roll them thinner as I want to use them to make freezer breakfast sandwiches. Easy, quick recipe. Tip: knead the dough on a large piece of parchment paper, then pat it out and cut into squares or rounds right on the paper. Just lift the paper onto the baking sheet and slide it all into the oven. Will save you cleaning and pan and your counter.

Great recipe, I followed as directed and they were super yummy with my beef stew.  They would also be great with butter and jam.  This will be a new favorite in my house!! Oh and they were quick to make with ingredients that I had on hand.

I don't like any biscuit except KFC, never have. This recipe is PERFECT!

Hints:
I only kneaded the dough 12 times (fold in half, punch, fold in half punch, etc..) 

I used a cheese grater & grated my frozen stick of UNSALTED butter until ready to use. This saves you from having to cut butter into the mix (which produces uneven pieces.

Right after the biscuits came out I brushed them with melted butter (a little salt added). 

Just printed this recipe & added to my Grandmothers recipe book she handed down to me.

Was looking forward to these and was dissappointed with the end result.  The batter was very wet so had to work in extra flour.,,biscuits didn't raise much (my baking powder is new) & they were doughy inside even though I baked them for an additional 10 minutes.

I have to admit, when I was stirring in the buttermilk I was very wary of how this was going to turn out.  I've never in m life made buttermilk biscuits before so maybe the consistency of the dough was spot on, but it looked to me like it was going to turn into a hockey puck of a biscuit.  Boy, was I wrong!  These are delicious!  And super fast and simple.  I'll definitely be making them again.

These were tasty and i followed the exact recipe- ingredients wise- but i followed the advice of the buttermilk biscuits video by folding the dough. They are good but crusty on the outsides. I achieved the layers (i assume through the folding and frozen butter, cold milk) but i suppose i was expectingna softer biscuit. If the "Kentucky" style denotes a crustier shell, then they were spot on.

Perfect! I make breakfast almost everyday and recently decided I didn't want to buy can biscuits, after a month of dry tasteless recipes I almost gave up. These biscuits saved the day and are so easy and simple to make. Thanks!

They tasted fine but they didn't raise much at all.  I cooked them longer hoping they would rise which they didn't.  Maybe I did something wrong with the kneading.

This is a really good biscuit recipe. I can actually bake biscuits now. They are not as good as my moms but I can't achieve biscuits like that and no one else I know(person or restaurant) can so I am happy with this recipe. I let them set for 15 minutes before baking and they were bigger and lighter. Thanks for sharing.

Prepared as indicated except for the long kneading period. Great moistness and texture, and full of buttery goodness but definitely needed more salt.

I have just made my 4th batch of these in 3 days.  Everyone loved them.  I followed the comments by some reviewers suggesting the butter be put in the freezer and grated.  This is a keeper.

i have been looking for a moist biscuit recipe that didn't require too much work, and that i couldn't mess up with too much flour. this was perfect. it actually tastes like the Bojangles biscuits my husband and i love. i ran out of white flour and did half wheat, and it still tasted great.

Not bad, but pretty crumbly. It was hard to knead them due to stickiness. Mine didn't rise very much at all for some reason...

Great! Gramma always put an egg wash on hers and I might add that next time, but they were great without it!

I really liked these and the only difference between this recipe and my old one is the addition of the baking soda. The edges are crispy while the insides are tender and they actually have a flavor other than just tasting "floury". I didn't have buttermilk, just used 2%.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Cookin'!

Not sure what I did wrong! I followed the directions exactly (might have accidently added a bit more buttermilk) and did the 6X6 square in with the dough, but the biscuits were not completely cooked from the inside! The taste was good, I left it longer in the over tho it made it a bit dry. If I make it again, I will try to flatten it more.

I rolled mine out and used a biscuit cutter - don't roll too thin, though. Wonderful southern taste.

Delicious! I never make my own biscuits out of fear of making tasteless stones. I followed this to the letter and was pleased with the outcome for a simple, delicate, unopposing biscuit. I believe it needs two dashes of salt, as they were sweeter than savory. These WERE very easy - I will be making these again and again.

At last - a biscuit recipe I don't have to spend 15 minutes rolling around before I just give up and make drop biscuits. This recipe is like Mary Poppins- practically perfect in every way. (Could maybe use a little more salt.)

Deliciously simple, classic buttermilk biscuits. I was reluctant about the technique of baking them all in one square, but they tore apart beautifully.   Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a biscuit made without shortening.  I made them without modifying the recipe, and they were the best biscuits I have ever made!  This is much better than the roll and cut approach, where the biscuits from the second rolling come out tougher.  This will be my regular biscuit recipe from now on!

Amazing! I followed the advice of others and grated frozen butter - it's quick with a food processor. I also cut down on the kneading time (maybe 30 seconds) and they turned out fluffy and wonderful. Thank you for the great recipe.

I am a good cook but have struggled to find a biscuit recipe I like.  Finally....THIS IS IT!  I made these on the Fourth of July and they were perfect.  The only thing I did differently was to make them in the food processor.  This is a keeper... :)

People were baking biscuits as they settled our land-and they probably tasted like these.I have been searching for the perfect biscuit recipe and this is it. Ones I have tried before weren't much better than canned biscuits, these really do taste quite a bit like KFC biscuits-only better because they are homemade. Slightly crispy on the outside and soft and tender inside-yum-all that's needed is butter and honey!

These biscuits are AWESOME!!  I have never been a fan of biscuits, but these are really good.  I had to use a buttermilk substitute (1 TBS lemon juice in a 1-cup measuring cup and add milk to make 1 cup) as we had no buttermilk.  They turned out wonderful!  I do think next time, though, I will add a little salt as suggested by other reviewers.  And, I will probably try cheese or other seasonings on them as well.  Can't wait!

Update: I really love this recipe and use it to top pot pies or rolled out and topped with light pizza-type ingredients.

I have made these many times now.  This recipe is wonderful as written.  More recently I have made some personal preference changes.    I whisk the dry ingredients for a minute or two to make sure the baking powder and soda are evenly distributed.  I think it is critical to either whisk or sift the dry ingredients.  I substitute 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for 2 tablespoons of flour.  I use half butter and half butter flavored Crisco.  In the past, I used all butter for everything but I get better results when I use them combined.  I never have buttermilk on hand so I sour ordinary milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice and let it sit for about 10 minutes.

I made these biscuits with whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out great. I did increase the buttermilk to 1 cup as a result.  I come from the Bisquick School of Biscuit making so I only kneaded these 6 times, I think. They were light and fluffy.

Quickest biscuits I've ever made.  Came out perfectly.  Moist inside, nice crunch outside.  I mixed together dry ingredients with a whisk, grated the stick of butter right into the bowl with the dry mixture, lightly coated the butter shreds with the flour mix and then added the buttermilk.  Barely moistened, then patted into a rectangle by hand on parchment paper on the cookie sheet. Gave 12 perfect square biscuits--but I do miss the round shape.  Next time I'll try rolling and cutting.  Very good taste!

This is a super biscuit recipe.  I omit the sugar and increase the salt to 1 tsp.  So easy, good and quick...this is my 12 yo favorite thing to make at dinnertime! I have had great success with both buttermilk and the milk/vinegar method.

I made 30 small biscuits with this (cut them with cutter instead of making squares).  It was my first attempt at making biscuits and they turned out great!  Great taste, light and fluffy.  I'll definitely be making these again soon.

Holy  cow these were awesome!!! My hubby said they tasted like the KFC biscuits. I did forget to put the salt in but they were still so yummy. I brushed melted butter over the tops when they came out of the oven.

Oh how I love these biscuits! It is perfect as is. Some other cooks have suggested to double or increase the amount of butter but I noticed that when I do that the dough does not rise as much and is just too buttery. The only suggestion I have is to freeze the butter and then shred it to help cut it with the dry ingredients. A great recipe, thanks for sharing!

So..... I totally botched this recipe while making it.  I was short by a 1/4c flour so I added some rye flour I had on hand.  Figured it was a very small amount and wouldn't make much difference.  When I added the buttermilk to the dry mixture it was not the right consistency.  You couldnt knead it, you could stir it.  Since I was out of flour, I used bisquick to thicken and knead it.  You see what I mean I botched the recipe!?  Ok...so after all my attempts to ruin this biscuit (not on purpose),  IT WAS AWESOME.  I pulled it out of the oven and thought it was headed for the trash.  Decided I would take one bite because I was wasting so many ingredients.  They were so moist on the inside with just a tiny crust on the outside.  I cant wait to try it again and do it correctly! :)

It was pretty good.  Because we used unsalted butter, the recipe could use more than just a dash of salt.  A little sweet for our taste.

These turned out great!  The only substitution I made was replacing the butter with margarine.I only kneaded for about 12-15 turns and they turned out so light and fluffy!  Amazing!  Thanks a bunch for sharing!!

These were very good. I also used vinegar and milk since I didn't have buttermilk. I used fat free milk and fat free butter and they actually turned out great, I was surprised.

If only I could give these a 10. I have been looking for a   diner type biscuit recipe for ages.  These will go well with sausage gravy.  I let mine sit for 15 minutes as suggested by  Marcia W.  They rose up quite nicely.  They filled the house with a nice hot biscuit smell.  I will stop searching for the "perfect biscuit."

Let me make this clear.  I don't like bicuits much.  Pretty bland and tasteless.  But my husband loves biscuits so I relented and tried this recipe.  Okay, I eat my words...I LOVE these biscuits!!  I was floored by how tasty they were.  And everyone is right, knead the dough very little (about 10 times) and they will be oh so tender.  Now I have a freezer full so we can have them with almost all our meals.  I am converted!!

So easy and so tasty!  I didn't think these were heavy at all.  I didn't knead for 2 minutes - just long enough to incorporate everything together.  These are easy enough to make at the last minute.  Way better than bisquick, and almost just as fast!

Just made 2 batches- one for dinner tonight and the other to last throughout the week. Great taste-but they didn't rise as high as expected so I agree with the others to knead the dough lightly and not too many times. Will most definately make these again!

These are a dense southern biscuit.  Great with sausage and gravy or Fried chicken, if your looking for a light fluffy flair these are not for you.  This is truly a hungry mans bicuit.  These are great, thanks for the post.

This is the best biscuit receipe I've ever made. I make it at least once a week and we've eaten them for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks . . . they are gobbled up with butter, jelly, honey, cheese and they make a great biscuit topping for pot pie.  This is really THE BEST biscuit recipe!

These were ok - nothing spectacular, but then again, they're not supposed to be - it's a good basic biscuit.  I did increase the salt from a "dash" to about 1/2t.  Also, didn't knead 2 minutes, that would make them way too tough.  I mixed until just combined, then turned out on a floured board, spread to about 12 x 12, and folded in quarters in order to get nice flaky layers.  Baked for about 20-25 minutes (I made 9 instead of 12).  Great with soup.

Absolutely fantastic! I didn't change a thing. I just made a dozen of these, and as I write, there are only two or three left on the still-warm cookie sheet. These taste, look and have the desired consistency of what was expected. I will add this to the favorite list.

These biscuits were GREAT!!! Easy to prepare, very little mess involved. WONDERFUL flavor, flakey, just the right consistency inside. Cooking time given was right on the mark. Only change I made was...I used 2% milk. Did not have any buttermilk. Most biscuit recipes and especially store-bought biscuits taste very salty. But these DO NOT!! My husband LOVED them also. I will be making these again. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Wow..these are so simple and delicious!  I made a triple batch, but it still didn't last long.  Nice and crispy, but light..and, compared to most biscuits, these are moist!  I used my leftovers for ham and cheese sandwiches, as well as breakfast sandwiches..and the square shape accomodated itself well to that.

I wanted to try these for biscuits and gravy.  When I made them yesterday, I didn't have buttermilk so I thought I would just add a little more butter and use skim milk (which is what I had on hand).  Well I was doing good until I had a brain fade and added water instead of the milk.  I didn't even think about it until after they came out of the oven.  They weren't bad except I should have baked them a little longer in my oven.  They were a little doughy but good enough.  I can't wait to try them with the right ingredients if they turn out that well with the wrong ones!!! teehee!!  Thanks for a keeper!!!!

I rarely screw up on anything I bake, but I must have somewhere with these because they took about 50 minutes to bake enough so they weren't doughy by then they were too hard on the outside I wont make these again. they came out shaped funny too.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make, and I can whip them up quickly if guests are coming. They go excellently with soup as a sub for crackers, and they turn out so light and delicious you can just eat them on their own.

Today my husband asked me to make biscuits. I normally use bisquik for this but ran out. So I decided to come to all recipes to find a biscuit recipe. This was the best thing I could have done because I tried this recipe as directed and it was GREAT! My husband loved it and said that he hasn't tasted one of these old fashioned biscuits since his grandma passed on. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for Sharing it!

Didn't have buttermilk so i substituted: mix 3/4 Tbsp white vinegar and enough milk to = 3/4 cup and allow to stand for 10 minutes.

The biscuits were easy to make w/ no cutters and very good, though slightly crumbly.

This is the same Biscuit recipe my Grandmother made when I was growing up.  I only changed it a little bit.  Instead of butter I used margarine and for the buttermilk (Grandma taught me this one) I used milk with lemon juice.  Hers called for sour milk, which is the same as buttermilk or lemon juice, and milk.  She called it poorman's buttermilk.  She had 6 kids to feed and she went with what was less expensive.  She always had the ingredients but not always the buttermilk.  This is a fantastic recipe.  I thought I had lost it till I found this one thanks for giving it back to me.  With my Grandma now 87 she does not remember and no one else bothered to write it down.  A must try!!!!!

Wow!  Where I'm from, we'd call these tea biscuits. Regardless of the name, they're yummy! The only change I made to this recipe was to cut out traditional round biscuits rather than leave them in wedges.  My hubby loved them, and so did I.  They were very light and fluffy.  A double batch didn't even last us a day!!  This one will go in my recipe binder, it's a keeper.

The picture associated with the recipe would give slight indication that the end product was round. Not sure how you get a circle from a square. From a 6x6 dimension your yield is tiny.  I want a biscuit not a brick.

Oh my gosh, this is the best biscuit recipe I've ever made! My family devoured the biscuits before I had a chance to serve them for breakfast the next morning. The biscuits were easy to make and definitely restaurant quality. We, southerners, love buttery, flaky biscuits, and this recipe is a keeper.

Easy basic biscuit.  I love the idea of just rolling it out and cutting.  Faster than making individual biscuits.  Everyone loved them.

I added blueberries and just mixed the dough until it came together. The biscuits had good flavour and tenderness but I had to bake them for 20 minutes at 400. I put the dough in parchment paper lined muffin tin for easier handling.

Absolutely the best!  I've tried a lot of biscuit recipes off the site, and these are far and away the best.  Flakey, pillowy, and crisp outside.  Perfect balance of baking soda/powder without an overpowering taste.  You can't go wrong.

It's unusual that I don't have any little tweaks that I make to a recipe to make it my own, but this recipe doesn't need it.  Everyone loves these biscuits.

Great! Turned out perfect next time i'd like to use cookie cutters. I also brushed the tops with egg whites before baking to give them that golden top! Also didn't have any butter milk so I mixed the 3/4c milk with about 1tbs lemon juice in its place.

I needed a quick crust to put over leftover stew for the pot pie effect.  This was perfect... quick and easy!  made as directed except I didn't knead for more than I needed to get it to stick, maybe a minute...  flattened by hand on my floured board and cut into three pieces and placed each on top of a scoop of stew in individual casserole dishes.  Baked at 400 for 25 (watching carefully for over browning the last 5).  It was perfect!!  I had one little sliver that I cut off and baked separately and it came out delicious too, nice and crispy but soft and moist on the inside.  I'm definitely going be using this recipe again.  It replaces my previous quickie biscuit favorite (it required shortening and I'd prefer to never touch shortening again)

Love this recipe! It's become my old faithful. My husband says it's the best biscuits he's ever had, and that's from a picky bread eater! I make my own butter milk with milk and vinegar and heat it for a minute in the microwave, then it's very warm when added to the flour and butter, it melts the butter a little bit and makes the dough really soft. I never knead it or let them set before baking, and they turn out huge!

Wonderful! These biscuits are the best.  I used the food processor - with a quick mix of dry ingredients, then pulse in the butter, and then mix in the buttermilk until it just comes together. Knead for just a bit. It took just a few minutes and the dough was still well chilled. The biscuits are light, tender, and delicious!

I didn't have buttermilk but used soured milk instead. Maybe that was the reason it had no flavor but I've made biscuits with soured milk and they came out great with wonderful flavor. Sorry, this recipe is a 'no' for me.

I was actually looking for the KFC biscuit recipe when I found this one so I give it a try and I have to say this is the best biscuit recipe I've ever come across and I was raised making biscuits I prefer this one over the home style way of making biscuit it's also very easy recipe I mixed the ingredients in my kitchen aid and I believe it helps them turn out fluffier, but if you don't have a mixer like a KitchenAid, then you can use regular mixer.  the main thing about this type of buscuit is that you don't want to over mix them.  And then just use a buscuit cutter (top of a canister works) to cut them out and they're just wonderful they taste just like KFC biscuits!

I just made these and followed the recipe exactly.  Oh so tasty.  Slightly dry on the outside but the inside was nice and moist and flaky.  Easily remedied with a little butter on top.  So quick and easy to make.  I will definitely be making these again!

I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted it with 3/4 cup of milk with an almost Tbs of white vinegar and let it sit while working on the rest. I was softening the butter in the microwave and melted it by accident so I just poured the melted butter in the dry ingredients and stirred until it resembled crumbs. When I poured in the buttermilk substitute, It never got thick enough for me to kneed so I poured the batter into an 8x8 pan because I didn't have a 6x6.  I think it turned out great. It was very easy.  I will make this again with the same errors.

Please forgive my 80's lingo, but I'm going to say, "totally awesome"!  I made stew for a friend and his family and wanted biscuits to go with it.  I'm so glad I happened on this one. So easy and very little investment in time. Thank you!

These are delicious, warm out of the oven served with butter and jam, my family devored them. Where it calls for milk I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 unsweetened soy milk because of my lactose sensative son.

This recipe is so solid!  Flakey, moist, crisp on the outside.  
A fun twist:  I had some sweet and spicy peppers so I set them on the burner to roast.  Dice them and add them, some sharp cheddar cheese and some garlic powder to the mix after you combine wet and dry.  It's insane!!

This recipe has become my go-to for brunch biscuits. It is very easy to make and can be halved easily. I usually use unsalted butter and almond milk in my biscuits, so I add a pinch more salt to the recipe. I also roll out and cut my biscuits on a floured surface rather than slicing the dough as it calls for in the recipe. These are great biscuits for any occasion!

Turned out great!  The only change I made was cutting them in a round shape before I baked them.  I also let it set for about 10 minutes before I baked them. It lets the baking powder activate more and therefore more rising,

Finally!  I can make a biscuit!  I've tried many other recipes, but so far this is the only one that worked for me.  Super fluffy, great flavor.  The trick is cold butter (not shortening), buttermilk, and don't overwork the dough.

The BEST biscuits!!! I love this recipe because it uses butter instead of shortening. The recipe is so easy and they always come out great!

YUM! I just made these buscuits.  I have made others from this site and my husband said these are the best I have ever made!  I never have buttermilk just sitting around so I used 3/4 cup of milk with 3/4 TBSP vinegar.  So quick and easy, light and fluffy.

Very easy and tasted delicious.  My kids and husband loved them.  They are flaky and taste somewhat like Kentucky Fried Chicken Biscuits.

This is hands down the best recipe that I've ever tried. I've made it twice in the last 2 days and now my family wants them all the time.  They are so good that word has spread all the way to Florida where my aunt lives and they can't wait for thanksgiving to try them. I have to keep a frsh quart of buttermilk in my fridge at all times. Thanms for this great recipe.

So easy and so good.  I added a little more salt, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They rose nicely, were lightly crispy on the bottom and edges, and were pillowy soft on the inside.  Really great with homemade blackberry jam!

Made these last night and they were great.  I didn't knead for 2 minutes, but only a few seconds to make a dough.  These were light and fluffy and I litterally had layers!!  Never had that before with a biscuit recipe. I will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!!

These were classic biscuits. They rose high and the texture was perfect.  The flavor was excellent, I think due to the addition of sugar.  I will admit that I ventured from the suggested method of leaving the dough together scored in the pan.  The dough had such a beautiful elasticity that I couldn't help resist using a biscuit cutter to separate.  This is my new go-to recipe when making homemade biscuits.

These were very good!  I would also suggest, as others have, adding a bit more salt.  Will use this recipe again, and will also try with different seasoning variations. Thanks! PS-I freeze any leftover buttermilk in ice cube trays and place in a ziplock!! Works perfect so that you don't waste, always have it on hand and can buy it on sale without having to use it right away.

Excellent biscuits!!  This is my substitution for buttermilk:  2 heaping tablespoons of greek yogurt plus a splash of vinegar in a cup with enough milk to make the 3/4 cup needed.  Works great

YUM! Made as directed but shredded frozen butter in my cheese grater (which is the greatest baking tip known to man!). These were FANTASTIC! Great with butter for soup and jam for breakfast. Will definitely make again!

Not too bad. Has a heavy flour taste, and is a little doughier than I like my biscuits to be, but still a serviceable recipe.

The flavor of these was wonderful, but mine didn't stay together very well for some reason.  I incorporated the butter with a pastry blender, and it worked beautifully.  I also added 1/8 tsp. salt.  It seemed like they needed more buttermilk, so I think next time, I'll increase it to 1 cup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic biscuit recipe. Very easy to put together, my favorite type of recipe. ;) However, this was my first time trying out the roll out method and I didn't like it as much as just the drop kind so perhaps I will try this again but roll them a bit by hand. The biscuits just didn't seem as fluffy as the drop method.

I loved these biscuits.  I have a son with milk allergies so I used margerine and almond milk with a little vinegar for the buttermilk and I thought they were delicious.  I'm sure they're even better prepared according to directions!

This was a great recipe as a base recipie. I dont think that I have ever stuck to original ingredients in any of my cooking. I always like to throw a bit of my own personal touch in things. 
I too didnt have butter milk on hand. 1/4 cup yougurt, 1/4 table cream, just under 1/4 cup of 2% milk. I added tablespoon or so of Apple Cider Vinegar and it worked great.
I cut into the squares like they suggested the first time like they suggested but found I needed more time so I am going to seperate them his time. and add another 3-4 minutes in cooking time. 
We're serving them with Scallop Potato, Baked ham and Honey glazed carrots.
Thanks for the great base for lovely fluffy bisquits...

I used milk and vinegar to make a substitute for buttermilk because I didnt have any on hand. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. When mixing the butter into the flour, I cut it into small squares (approximately 1/2 tbls. in size). It made preparing the dough quick and simple. This recipe was SO easy and the biscuits turned out moist, fluffy, and delicious! I also added a scoop of butter on top of the biscuits fresh out of the oven. Definitely will make these again!

The biscuits didn't rise how I would have wanted and were a little dry. I think the dryness might be due to using powdered buttermilk instead of regular buttermilk. I also use wheat flour, so more liquid and rising agents next time. The taste was good. A little bland, but that is the recipe. I would add cheddar and garlic powder/salt if I make these again.

My husband and I loved these biscuits. I didn't have any buttermilk so I made some by mixing the 3/4 milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I used some other peoples suggustion to grate the butter and it made mixing in the butter so much easier. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will use it whenever I want biscuits from now on.

I just pulled these out the oven and I am writing this review as I am eating a biscuit. These are so delicious! This is my third time trying a biscuit recipe, and this is definitely a keeper. The only change I made was I added a 1/4 tsp. of salt instead of a dash like another person suggested. If there is any recipe you try, this should be the one.

My husband loved 'em and said I hit a home run with these!  The only negative comment I have is that they yield 12 tiny biscuits (2"x2" squares) so the next time will double the recipe and cut them into larger pieces.

Our whole family LOVES this recipe. I have made homemade buttermilk biscuits in the past and have had them not turn out, or not taste all that good. I tried this recipe and oh my! It was so easy to make them, and they turned out wonderful, even the next day they were still moist and delicious. Will be making this recipe again and again! Thank you!

Solid recipe - I make this on a regular basis.  Came out nice and flaky.  Didn't knead a full two minutes at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Only kneaded until the dough held together.

My house is conflicted with this recipe. I personally didn't care for them as a breakfast type biscuit, I thought they worked better as a base for Kahlua Pork. My husband thought they were really good though. We both agreed that they could have been fluffier, but they were really moist. I'll keep in the box for savory instead of breakfast biscuits.

The came out very good, but a little bland. They needed more than a "dash" of salt. I should have used at least 1/2 teaspoon of salt, but maybe that's because I used unsalted butter. The recipe doesn't specify what kind of butter to use. I had to bake them about 20 minutes. Very light and buttery. I'll definitely make these again!

I usually have trouble getting biscuits to turn out, but these turned out Perfect.  I did not have buttermilk, so I subbed half milk and half yogurt, and it worked just fine.  Great recipe!

These were flaky and moist, but pretty bland.  I'd consider adding a salty grated cheese or cutting them in half so people don't forget to butter and jam them.  The biscuits didn't get as tall the biscuit in the photo either.

Wow!  I have made biscuits for years and while this recipe made the dough far to "wet" (normal for biscuit recipes), when I added that extra flour to board and patted rather than rolled, they were so soft.  I did not knead the dough at all.  I used a fork to mix and when it was mixed, I left it for 15 minutes, scooped it onto the board and followed the directions of another reviewer who said to pat rather than roll.  These were, in my opinion, the best I have ever made.  Far better, in my opinion, than any I have eaten at KFC (Even at Store number W812069 in Detroit)!

I loved this recipe. Like another review, I naturally just pat out the biscuits in a more scone-like manner. They were just wonderful, and to sound like another person's review, tasted a lot like Pillsbury, but better for you!

Rarely will you find a recipe as perfect as this. Like mentioned, the biscuits are buttery and flaky and altogether awesome. The only thing I would change is the size of the rolled-out dough square. 6x6 is very small, and my biscuits flopped all over the place in the oven because they were so much taller than they were wide.

Mmm...These were so good! I followed the recipe exactly, using organic and natural ingredients (unbleached flour, turbinado sugar, coarse sea salt, unsalted butter) and low-fat buttermilk. I was so impressed. They turned out delicious and moist, and I didn't even want to spread them with butter, jelly or honey. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

Being a KY girl I was drawn in by the name.  I have made theses a few times and are much better (sorry mom) than the biscuits I grew up with.  I knead about 10 turns until the dough is holding together and I let rest at least 15 minutes before I bake.  Very tender biscuits...thanks for the recipe.

I've been on a quest to find the perfect biscuit recipe and I found it today.  These biscuits are perfect with a few modifications.  I used 1 tsp. salt and froze and grated the butter (per other posts). I also used almost a full cup of buttermilk. I lightly mixed the dough, careful not to overwork. Put dough on greased flat baking sheet and cut into squares as was suggested in another post. Then let dough rest for about 10 min., spread melted butter on top and baked as directed.  I ate 3 of these with a glass of milk straight out of the oven.  The flavor and texture were perfect.  No need for more butter, honey, jam or anything.  Although they would be wonderful with anything on them.

My 12 year nephew made these the first and it was a simple recipe to follow. They came out great, I make these every Sunday for breakfast and my family loves them. They are fluffy and great with strawberry preserves. I did adjust the recipe slightly by using 1/4 cup of crisco shortening and 1/4 cup of chilled butter instead of the 1/2 cup of butter it calls for and it balances out well.

My made-from-scratch biscuits have always been good, but in my opinion, not great.  I decided to try to find a great recipe.  I searched through 7 pages and over 100 recipes till I decide on this  one.  FABULOUS!!!!  I received raves from the people that always thought my biscuits were good before.  I did not change a single thing and  measured all ingredients which is something I never did. This is now the only recipe I will use. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!!

The buttermilk gives it a nice flavor, but the biscuits are super small, and have an odd texture. Good for a midnight snack, not so much for a dinner party.

One of the best biscuit recipes I've tried.  I followed the one reviewer's suggestions and sifted the dry ingrediants a couple of time to make sure they were well incorporated, and I did not kneed the dough as much as it suggested.  These turned out perfectly done with great taste and texture.

These biscuits were delicious. I do have one suggestion- sub half (one cup) of self-rising flour for the all-purpose flour to make them super fluffy. They are too delicate for biscuit sandwiches, but are wonderful anyway. Next time I will probably add some herbs or spices for a little extra flavor kick. All said, I believe I have FINALLY found my perfect, go-to biscuit recipe. Yum!

Oh my! These are super delicious (despite the fact I didn't read the instructions properly and partially softened the butter). I glazed half of them with mixed melted butter/honey towards the end...yum!! I can't wait to make these again with non-softened butter :)

OH MY GOODNESS!! These were the best and easiest biscuits I have ever made. My family devoured them! The only change I made was I added 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of sugar because we like our biscuits a little sweeter. Awesome recipe!!

Really delicious, very tender buscuits.  Sometimes I like to make buscuit sandwiches and these are too delicate for that, but this is, by far, the best buscuit recipe I have ever tried.

These are excellent.  Mine didn't rise as much as I expected, but I didn't let them sit and it's pretty cold here.  Still, they were flaky and fluffy and delicious.

Excellent with sausage gravy in the morning. I made this ahead the night before and made a big pot of gravy in the morning. This was the best recipe for biscuits I have come across and they were easy to make and were done in no time! A hit with my five litle blessings!

These were tasty. Good flavor, but mine didnt rise as much as I thought they would. I did use half whole wheat flour so maybe thats what did it. I had these with the "chocolate gravy II" from this site. Sooo tasty! I also used these to make the "teddy bear biscuits" from here for my boys.

These were delicious!  I did follow the tip from other reviewers suggesting to grate the cold butter with a box grater into the dry ingredients.  I drizzled honey on the top and they were well received by adults and children.

I am giving this four stars only because I am an inexperienced cook and will need to try it again to give it a higher rating. This is my very first batch of biscuits and they are *so* good. Fluffy, light with a crunch top and tender inside. My only complaint is that they aren't as golden as I would like but with a taste this good, I don't really care. 
My variation was to use regular milk instead buttermilk because I didn't have any on-hand and wasn't adventurous enough to 'make' it. Also, although I see it says you need to knead it for 2 minutes, I aimed for more like a minute, since I was worried about the dough becoming tough. I used a glass to cut out nice circular shapes and 15 minutes or so later, I was thrilled. I will DEFINITELY make these again.

this recipe was awesome.  I tried the trick with the vinegar to milk (carnation milk) instead of Buttermilk and I doubled the butter as someone else suggested.  Very good!!  I live in NC and we have Biscuitville and my husband said they were the next best thing!!

These were excellent! Just got done eating them with some homemade apple butter!

I didn't have any buttermilk so I used plain yogurt and increased that to 1 cup.  Also left them about 3/4-1" and spritzed them with canola oil from my kitchen spritzer before putting them into the oven. I baked them for 20 minutes because they were thicker but could have used a couple of minutes more.

Best biscuits I've ever made.  Thanx so much for the recipe.

Oooh, these were delicious!  Very light and fluffy.  I even had to substitute margarine because I was low on butter, but they still turned out fantastic.  The biscuits can only be better with butter.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I was disappointed in this one. These were dense and heavy. We prefer a lighter fluffier biscuit. Very moist, nice smooth texture, beautiful presentation, but not much flavor. I expected better with the high ratings, so I may try again, as I had to make some substitutions. I used bread flour not all-purpose, margarine not butter, and 2% milk/lemon juice not buttermilk. I really liked they way these were made by rolling out and then cutting. That is a great idea! I may try these again when I have all the ingredients on hand and see if they are any better that way. Thanks Cookin4my3boys, this was such an easy recipe to make and I enjoyed trying something new.

Holy cow! These were so much easier to make than the normal biscuit recipe as you avoid the whole rolling and cutting mess. I made these as stated except added a little extra sugar. I also blended the butter and dry ingredients in my food processor, this is my favorite way to cut butter in. After blending I let the dry mixture rest in the fridge for a little while to make that butter nice and cold. I ended up adding a little extra flour when kneading because it was quite sticky. But the end results were the best biscuits I have ever tasted! Not dry at all, lightly crisped on top and flaky and soft inside, Yum, yum yum! I will never make another biscuit recipe again!

I just tried this recipe. The biscuit came out nice. I brush the top with buttermilk and sprinkle it with sugar so the top has some "crunch" to it. It was good. Thanks for the recipe.

best biscuts I've ever made, I did use buttermilk instead of milk and buttered them immeditatly out of the oven. So good soft and fluffy inside. I also broiled them for the last five minutes so they would have color on top. Perfect recipe though.

I can't believe I just made biscuits from scratch! It was great. It did seem like it was missing something.. but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. As a family member said, "it's almost perfect!"

I did change a few things. I sifted the dry ingredients, used Smart Balance instead of butter and I didn't have any buttermilk so I took another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to milk.

Overall easy and excellent! Will make it again :-)

I used to think that nothing could come close to mayonnaise biscuits as being my favorite.  But this recipe is simply amazing!  I have to admit that I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have ANY milk whatsoever.  So I replaced the buttermilk with heavy whipping cream.  I'm not sure how much that really affected the result, but these biscuits came out so soft on the inside and flaky on the outside.  Definitely don't overknead!!!  I had to use self-rising flour too which meant that I didn't add any additional baking soda/powder/salt.  I don't have a 6x6 pan either, so I used my 8x8 and baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes as directed.  The dough was a little sticky to work with so I had to press it into the pan.  Biscuits came out with a light brown on top.  I can't wait to try this as a pot pie crust--I'll probably have to add a little more liquid for that though.  UPDATE:  I tried this recipe again following the recipe to the "T" and I wasn't as impressed.  Next time I will definitely use cream in lieu of the milk since I had better results that way.  Thanks!

I am absolutely horrible at making biscuits. But these turned out great. I only kneaded about a dozen times and I didn't roll it out, I patted it down instead. I had to cook them an extra 5 minutes, but the were crunchy on the outside and moist and layered inside.

Loved 'em!  So easy!  Rolling and then cutting into squares is brilliant.  Saves time. I did use half whole wheat flour and half white since I don't like using all white flour.  Also, I did not knead for 2 minutes as others suggested.  Just enough to get the dough to right consistency.  They came out great.

This is a great recipe. I use half all purpose flour and half cake flour to make these biscuits extra fluffy.

Wow!! These biscuits were awesome!!  I've been making biscuits for five years, and thought they were good, until I tried these.  Instead of buttermilk, I used regular milk with a dash of lemon juice in it, and it worked just fine.  I might up the milk to a scant cup next time.

So, so good!  Flaky and tender bisuits.  This is my new favorite recipe for biscuits and I was raised a die-hard Bisquick fan... Those are like death-wads compared to these!

These are great biscuits.  Very plain in flavor so they go wonderfully with butter or jams/jellies.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and kneaded much less and also rolled out into a rectangle and cut pieces rather than using a biscuit cutter.  Every one came out fantastic.  If you need a good basic biscuit recipe, this is a great choice.

I've been on a quest for the perfect biscuit and this just may be it!  They turned out perfectly as the recipe is written. The only thing I changed was I added a bit more salt and kneaded it only 10 times gently.  Great idea about rolling it on the pan and cutting it into squares!

These went nicely with our pot roast dinner tonight. I never knead biscuits as they can become tough. The less you handle the dough, the lighter they will be. Thanks!

Quick and easy recipe.  I've tried my hand at numerous biscuit recipes, and this is my favorite.  The buttermilk gives these biscuits a great flavor even a day later.

I jumped on here last night to find a buttermilk recipe for dinner and decided to try this one. WHAT a GREAT recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it, it's a keeper! Oh, and I didn't cut into squares, I used a glass and cut into round biscuits, worked perfectly!

I made this recipe twice to make sure I wasn't messing anything up and they just did not come out the way they should have. I found them to be very thick and the 15 minute baking time must be incorrect because both times I made them I had to extend the baking time by almost double and they were still a little doughy. I can't imagine what is wrong. Oh well,thanks anyway.

Great recipe!  My family likes this one better than my Joy of Cooking stand-by.  Flaky, moist, buttery, and a little sweet.  I used whipping cream with lemon, as I didn't have buttermilk.  These would be great for fruit-topped shortcakes, too.

very tender and yummy!I added about a tsp of salt. Also, I had no baking soda, but these still turned out wonderfully! I did put in a bit more baking powder just to be safe (since I had no soda)--can't wait to try them with the baking soda to see if it makes them even more flaky.

Delicious! I was short on butter when I made them (and didn't realize this until aftter I had started making a double batch) so I used half shortening and half butter. I was a little skeptical on how they would turn out, but they were excellent. I can't wait to try them the right way!
I also used half whole-wheat pastry flour as my family is health-conscious. They were very good and had nice flavor.

My 3 boys loved these biscuits. They are moist and flaky, the biscuits that is, not the boys. These are the easiest and the best biscuits I've ever made. My boys have requested that I make them again and I will definitely do so. I highly recommend trying this recipe.

What a great recipe for biscuits!! Just as light and tender as you could want. I did up the salt as others did the second time I made these and it did make a difference. Hubby doesn't like biscuits but he sure split and buttered these. Put them in the bottom of a big bowl and ladled my beef stew over, whoo what a meal!!!  Definitely a keeper!!

I loved these biscuits.  They were very light and fluffy.  I doubled the recipe and used half butter and half shortening and they turned out perfect.  I also rolled then out and cut with a bisuit cutter, but I put them right next to eachother on the pan.  It was only necessary to cook them 10 minutes.

I liked these and made them as written. Were I to make them again I would sift the dry ingredients two or three times instead of just once, cut them with a biscuit cutter, and bake them about a minute longer.

Oh, my heavens! My husband's mother is from KY, so he grew up eating homemade Kentucky biscuits. I made this recipe today for biscuits and gravy for him and his brother ~ there wasn't a crumb left!! Those boys devoured them. Not a light and fluffy biscuit, but that's the way my hubs likes them, so he would've eaten an entire second batch...which I'm making for supper  ;)

Fast. Easy.  SOFT and DELICIOUS!  Not your momma’s hockey puck biscuits!!!     I’ve been making this recipe a lot lately.   I follow exactly as written. All the reviewers freezing the butter....I did that too once and prefer to just use butter that is room temperature and it works perfectly.  Sometimes I increase the sugar to 1 and 1/2 tbsp.  Salt ... I add close to half a tsp because my butter is unsalted.  These are wonderful.  I usually hate biscuits, but not these.  They’re still soft the next day - I’m addicted to these.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Cooking tip: I didn’t have buttermilk on hand so I mix apple cider vinegar to milk using a 4:1 ratio. Works great!!

These biscuits were amazing! It was my first attempt at making biscuits and they were super easy. I used whole milk with vinegar in place of buttermilk and the finished product was delicious!

Only changes I made was increase salt to 1/2 teaspoon and buttermilk to 1 cup. Excellent biscuit, can't wait to try them with some sausage gravy.

Instead of using all purpose flour I used self-rising and I dropped the a spoon full in some flour and baked it. It came out okay. I would do this team recipe again.

This was my first attempt ever at baking scratch biscuits.  I thought this recipe was a good one for the adventure.  I was not disappointed.  I followed the tip from another reviewer to grate the butter while frozen before cutting in.  These turned out soooo buttery, with a fluffy yet firm texture.  When I am craving biscuits, this will be my recipe.

Don’t EVER kneed biscuits...You’ll want to grate your butter, then immediately return it to the fridge. Then, mix your dry ingredients well. (Sift then a few times, let the better get really cold again.) then, add the butter and work it into pea size bits with your fingers!!! The best part, so much messy fun. After, press out onto the work surface until about an inch thick. Fold it over itself twice. Then press again. After this, fold over one more time and press again. Make sure it’s about half an inch thick and cut out your biscuits. (If you don’t have a biscuit cutter coffee mugs are perfect! Then, place them close together on a skillet so they can climb up one another. The will be wonderful and you can pay yourself on the back!

I made these as directed but used lemon juice in milk as I didn’t have buttermilk.  Delicious, fluffy, perfect!  Had mine with butter and homemade blackberry jam and my husband, with my sausage gravy.  Very good!  I’m keeping this recipe!

I really like this recipe. It was super easy and turned out great. I didn’t have enough flour so I added about half whole wheat; I was afraid they  might turn out tough, but they were light and flaky. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The final product was light and fluffy. My biscuits were fragile and flavorful. They were big, fat thick squares - not pretty but damned tasty. I should have photographed em for comic effect, but we ate em too fast!

Fabulous biscuit. Slightly crispy exterior, moist, fluffy, buttery, divine. Used unsalted butter plus about 1/2 tsp of table salt. In lieu of buttermilk Used 1/2 tsp white vinegar and fat-free milk. 15 minutes cooking time was perfect for my oven.

These biscuits were very easy to make and turned out so good. Light, flaky, very good flavor. We had with sausage gravy and then with butter and jam. Good savory or sweet. I made mine larger so didn’t make 12 and didn’t shape them, just had them as drop biscuits. Highly recommend!

Very good recipe for a light  flaky biscuit.  Stayed true to the recipe, no problems at all.  I rolled out the dough fairly thin and folded it in 3rds, rolled out again and repeated about 4 times creating airy, flaky layers.  Will be using this recipe a lot!

I usually don’t bother with reviews but I couldn’t resist when I saw that there were 999 reviews, and I like even numbers, so here it goes. Like most people say, these biscuits are fantastic, buttery and flaky. I’ve made them three or four times, the only thing I change is to leave out the sugar. They’re really the perfect biscuit.

These came out great! I made them vegan by using Earth Balance buttery spread, instead of butter. I also used unsweetened almond milk with a tablespoon of melted Earth Balance buttery spread mixed into it, instead of buttermilk! They came out surprisingly buttery and melt in your mouth. :)

I liked this recipe a lot, I did add 50% more butter and I baked stacked layers for tall biscuits. I will double the baking powder next time, just a little dense.

This recipe is just okay. It makes biscuits but their flavor is not very good IMO. There is a sweetness almost like an aftertaste that I’m really not into. Also, they are super ...brick like? Pretty hard on the outside and crumbling. I prefer a buttery biscuit. If you want them to taste like KFC, this isn’t it. We’ve made these 3 times now and we are done.

Great recipe! Fluffy delicious biscuits. Simple, easy recipe. I did as others suggested and froze the butter beforehand and grated it in. I didn’t have buttermilk so I put a few drops of vinegar into the milk and let it sit.

The flavor of these is slightly bland. I added in almost a cup of cheddar cheese and it was my only modification. They’re light but also moist. I used these to go along with a chicken and dumplings type of dinner. :)

This recipe is wonderfully simplistic. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. I'll be honest, I cut mine into 8 because twelve would have been too small for me. For added color, I brushed some melted butter on the tops of the biscuits when they had 5 minutes left to cook, but otherwise this recipe was excellent.

Go to recipe for my family.  Perfect with soup and basically anything.  I separate the biscuits when I bake them as opposed to keeping them together.  Best tasting fresh out of the oven.

Beyond easy and perfect! They are nearly foolproof. I put off making biscuits from scratch because I had only witnessed folks use a time consuming, sticky and messy recipe. 
I divided them into smaller pieces and it worked out great for snackers, kids plates, etc. Will absolutely make these again.

cutting with a knife makes it easy, but I will probably separate them next time since I like the edges more done.

These biscuits were fantastic. I have been looking for a good replacement for the biscuits that a store near me stop carrying. These are light and fluffy with a good flavor. I bake mine in a cupcake tin just to make it easier Andy they were perfect! I will definitely be making these on a regular basis.

This is a GREAT biscuit recipe. I followed someone else’s suggestion and only kneaded for about 45 seconds, but everything else I followed to a “T”. Very easy to make and it got rave reviews from my family.

These turned out very light and fluffy, with a great taste. I think, next time, I will double the recipe so that I can make the biscuits bigger for my husband. You can add different spices or even cheese to give them a different taste; great base to start with. This is a great recipe!

Hands down the best biscuits I have ever had.  One trick that I used was to freeze the butter and then shed it like cheese.  I also brush the top of the biscuits with buttermilk right before I toss them in the oven.

I've been making biscuits for years.  I've tried several recipes over the years but mostly stuck with one favorite and basic one.  This recipe is my new go-to biscuit recipe.  They are slightly crispy/crunchy on the outside and a cloud of fluffy happiness inside.  Just remember when you're making biscuits: handle them as little as you can get away with and they will reward you by being tender and light.

These were wonderful and easy to make! Found my go-to recipe  for biscuits! I used a grater to grate the butter in and after I mixed and kneaded, used my pizza cutter to slice one way and made a “tic-tac-toe” board when it was on the baking sheet. Came out fluffy and super yummy! Can’t wait to make them again and switch it up with some spices and cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy and SO good. I find that if I freeze a stick of butter and grate it in to the dry ingredients it makes it even easier. I’ve also found that if I throw the dough in the fridge for about 5 minutes before rolling out that the biscuits rise better and are

This IS the closest to and "English Scone" I've seen on this site the only difference is I was taught "SPEED IS THE ESSENCE" to get them in the oven. Also, to warm the milk with the butter, combine with the dry ingredients and handle as least as possible. After combining all ingredients I just  tip the mixture out onto a floured surface and gently pat into a round also down VERY SLIGHTLY just to get an even top. NO KNEADING OR ROLLING as that will stop them rising. Place the mixture onto a silpat or paper-lined baking tray, cut without cutting all the way through and place in the oven. "LESS IS MORE" in the time and handling for "TRUE SCONES".

I also grated the butter and added to the dry ingredients. Pulsed a few times in the food processor and added the wet ingredients, then pulsed until just mixed. Dropped them on the cookie sheet and baked. They were light and fluffy. I used milk and lemon juice to replace the buttermilk with no difficulty.

These are my go to biscuits. They are super tender and can be modified for many things. Adding cheese and herbs are wonderful ?? If you add a little more sugar they make great biscuits for strawberry shortcake.

This is essentially the same recipe that I have used for years from a Southern Cookbook.  The only difference is, this one has 2 T. more butter, and isn't cut out with a biscuit cutter.  It was a good recipe, but I think I like mine a bit better because of the cut out biscuits.  It seems to yield more.  Plus I like the uniformity of the round biscuits over the odd shapes this recipe produces.

This was amazing! I followed the reviews and sift the ingredients a couple of times. I froze the butter and grated it into the flour also. Cut it with a pizza slicer and put it in the oven. Flavor was great and topped it with a little honey. Biscuits texture was spot on. Will be making this quick an easy recipe again!

I don't think I will make these again, they came out flat and crisp almost like a cracker, not soft and round like I thought. I don't know if I should have used self-rising flour or what, and even though they tasted good, I think I will try a different biscuit recipe.

Great recipe.  Only change I make is I use a biscuit cutter instead using a knife.

I made these biscuits with minor adjustments.  I substituted 2 tbsp of butter for crisco, added 2 tbsp of cornstarch, and I was out of buttermilk so I used whole milk instead.  I kneaded the dough for about a minute.  Let it rest for about 5 minutes (next time 30 min).  No rolling - flatten dough and cut into shape and baked.   Bake.  Can’t wait to taste.                                                         This recipe turned out to be the “WORST” that I have ever made.  The dough was doughy, tough, & tasteless.   I’ll stick to my recipe.   The were horrible

Very tasty and easy to make.  I cut them in small squares as directed thinking they would grow more than they did though.  They were fluffy but small -my kids loved them.

Pretty good biscuits and easy to make. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, which I probably will not do again. I enjoyed the taste, but I think everyone else enjoys lighter biscuits.

This recipe came out beautifully! I made one substitution using cream instead of buttermilk. Biscuits still came out gold brown on the outside, soft and crumbly on the inside. They didn't last 10 minutes once they were out of the oven. Highly recommend!

I have made this recipe many times.  I have discovered today though, that mixing it in my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough wand instead of by hand made these biscuits SO much better!  Mix the dry first of course with the wire whip, then change to the dough wand before adding cold cut-up butter and buttermilk.   They turned out nicely browned on the tops and oh so crumbly-tender on the inside.  My family loved these!

My second time making biscuits and they turned out pretty well. I didn’t have buttermilk. Used 3/4 cup sour cream and thinned with 1/4 cup of water to get a buttermilk substitute. I couldn’t tell a difference. Will make them again for sure!

These are wonderful! Used them for Chicken Ala King!  May take a little longer to bake though depending on thickness the inner part was a little doughy so I stuck them back in the oven for a few minutes longer, they were perfect!

I followed reviewers directions and grated a frozen stick of butter and kneaded for less than 2 minutes.  I rolled and used a biscuit cutter and froze the dough.  Later in the week, I thawed the biscuits at room temperature for 30 mins and then baked according to directions.  They smelled and tasted like Heaven!  These are a freezer staple for sure!

Absolutely delicious biscuits. I grated the cold butter as other reviewers suggested and it worked well. I was nervous about the kneading part, but it was very easy and the biscuits turned out soft and fluffy and so addicting!

Great basic recipe! Turned out flaky but not crumbly so they would probably hold up well enough for a breakfast sandwich which is usually what I'm looking for.  I didn't knead for  2 minutes.  just

Best, most delicious biscuits ever! Really! I made it as is, although I didn't have buttermilk, so I did the white vinegar and milk substitute. They were sooooo good. Tasty, soft and fluffy. Try it! We all agreed it beat my America's Test Kitchen biscuit recipe.

The biscuits tasted good but they were the most crumbly biscuits I've ever had. I don't bake much so I followed the directions exactly, I'm not sure what went wrong.

The recipe states to serve with a sweet topping, however I made it for sausage gravy to be poured on.  These biscuits were perfect with home made sausage gravy!  They're flavorful, a bit moister than the average biscuit, in a good way!  They cooked well, turned out golden brown on tool and bottom (had to add 5 more minutes on my oven).  Wonderful!  This recipe is a keeper!

Needed some bread to go with my eggs, so I whipped this together. I wasn't precise. I used 10-grain flour and yogurt instead of buttermilk, and they still came out great! I baked a batch right after mixing and another batch about a half hour later to test the theory that they would be lighter after letting the soda/powder rest for a bit. I only noticed a slight difference between the two batches; definitely not enough of a different that it would be worth the wait! I'll be making these again.

Yum, I have made several biscuit recipes some great and some ok.  I saw this and decided to give it a try, ran out of buttermilk so tried a mix of Greek yogurt and milk.  The biscuits were moist and yummy.   Would be a great recipe for camping since you don't need a rolling pin or biscuit cutter, just shape with your hands and cut with a table knife.

Made it using the exact measurements but I used canned evaporated milk and the biscuits turned out great! Crusty on the outside, and just soft and chewy, though still tender, on the inside. I like to take my stick of butter and throw it in the freezer for a few minutes and then actually grate it to get it soft.

Like another person said to do, I used a frozen stick of butter and grated it then kept in refrigerator until needed. So much easier then cutting in the butter. Didn't have buttermilk so added 3/4 Tbs lemon to 3/4 cup milk. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly except didn't knead that long. These were the best biscuits I've ever made. Thank you for a great recipe.

I was in a near panic this morning when I realised that I had forgotten self rising flour at the store yesterday.  With three boys to feed I needed a bread flour biscuit recipe in a hurry.  This recipe is very nearly identical to my own self rising flour recipe.  Four changes I made due to lack of ingredients are: whole milk instead of buttermilk, 3 tablespoons of canola oil instead of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, reduced the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon. Incorporate into a dough ball, I "knead" with a rolling pin because of pain in my hands.  I use a pizza cutter to cut into square biscuits. Bake at 425 for 12 minutes.  Use more oil for a flakier biscuit or less for a meatier biscuit.

Easy recipe. The dough was a little sticky and I misread the instructions about the greased vs ungreased sheet, but they were golden brown and cooked through. That surprised me a bit to tell the truth. These weren't the melt in your mouth biscut I prefer- a little dry and crumbly, but overall tasty.

I added about a cup of grated sharp cheddar and I think they were the best biscuits I've ever tasted! 

Rather than pressing into a 6x6 pan, I pressed it out to about a 9" round and ran a pizza cutter through it  (8 "slices").

The dough was much too wet to knead,  I would suggest  no more than 1/2 cup of buttermilk, maybe even a little less.

Loved these biscuits!  Visiting my daughter who didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted a sour cream/milk combination instead - 3/4 c. sour ream + 1/4 c. Milk.  Did find I needed more  than was called for.  Also, froze the butter and then grated it into the sifted dry ingredients.  And had to bake them at least ten extra minutes (maybe her oven is not quite right).  But they turned out so good and flakey! Flakiest biscuits I've ever made.   Can't wait to try it again using buttermilk.

Very nice, light and soft.  I only made one update.  I was making these to serve with chili so I added some mexican spices to the batter.  Also, brushed the top with butter when taken out of the oven and sprinkled on parmesan cheese.  Very good!

Great recipe. Very moist, soft, and literally falls apart in my hand. Thank you! I tried others but this recipe is so easy, fast to put together and comes out great every time. I find that the ingredient comes out kinda wet so I bake them in my muffin pan.  Works out  wonderful because I don't have to roll it or cut it up to round pieces before I bake them.

I made these biscuts, and after cooking them for the recommended time, and even a little longer, and they were really, really soft in the middle. Gooey, almost... I would use a little less butter than reccomended.

I considered using this recipe on a couple of occasions but didn't, I think because they were not traditional round biscuits (not that they couldn't be with this recipe - not sure why it discouraged me from trying them). I did finally make this recipe - in a rectangle as instructed - and they were the best biscuits I've ever made - and I've made lots of good biscuits. They rose beautifully, had gorgeous color, and were so flakey and delicious. I served them to guests and one commented, "My biscuits never turn out this good. I may need you to give me a biscuit baking lesson!"  One thing I always do in recipes that call for cutting in butter is to freeze the butter and then grate it with a box grater into the dry ingredients. Then I blend it in until it is "crumbly" and that always works really well. Great recipe. Can't wait to make them again.

I've tried a couple of different recipes at this point for biscuits and they were ok but a little too hard for us. This one is a keeper! Fluffy and delicious!! Thank you for sharing. I will be making these again and again.

I wanted biscuits and gravy, now. I didn't have premade dough or a box mix and didn't have the patience to roll and cut biscuits. THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! They went together super quick, and they tasted amazing. I was thrilled, and so was my husband with how they turned out.

I made these a day ahead of Christmas morning and warmed them in the microwave. Not the best plan but yum. Some leftovers are still in the fridge and were great with sausage gravy for dinner. I need more practice,I think, as they are a bit dense. I used the grated frozen butter. What a great idea!  I'll be using that in all my baking!

My daughter asks for these biscuits over any other. I’m so glad I found this recipe. Soft, flavorful biscuits that will make you the hero of the kitchen. It takes me 5 minutes to mix and BAM in the oven. Follow the recipe without changing a thing because these are perfect.

SUPER good recipe!!! This is only the second time that I can think of that I've made homemade biscuits (last recipe was a flop). They were SO moist and yummy and I got a lot of compliments on them! I didn't knead them too much, and also cut them into circles. There's just something about square biscuits that just doesn't seem right. One batch made about 8 biscuits when I cut them round. I brushed the tops with butter before baking and had to bake them about 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. Topped them with sausage gravy and voila! I will definitely be making these again!

Love these!  My new go to!  I froze and grated the butter as well.  I was out of buttermilk so I used whole milk and vinegar (worked wonderfully).  I did, however roll and but them into round biscuits, just my preference.

So amazing, so easy! I even had to make them with powdered buttermilk in a pinch and they were still great! Just pat them out and cut them in squares, no need to use biscuit cutters, but by all means use them if you want.

I followed  some others ideas of keeping the butter cold and then shredding it into the flour mixture. These were easy to make, quick, and delicious. My toddler and husband loved them.

I always make this recipe exactly as it's written and they are fabulous. When I remember, I like to freeze the butter and grate it in the food processor, but not always. I have gotten better and better turning the dough out to knead a few times....they just get more and more flaky layers. They aren't very good when reheated, always make them fresh!

The taste and texture were excellent!  Although, next time I would probably make a double batch, and cut out individual biscuits, instead of making a square and cutting through it.  I found that the middle didn't get quite done.  And I prefer perfect, uniform biscuits anyway!  ;-)

I believe in following the ingredients list precisely, the first time I make a recipe, and this is an excellent, basic biscuit recipe. I did alter the techniques some, just because experience has taught me a few things. I personally think kneading the dough for two minutes is too much and I never roll biscuits. instead of kneading, I fold the dough 6-12 turns, depending on texture and feel, and I press it out by hand, instead of rolling. Also, maybe my oven needs calibrated, but I had to bake for about 13 minutes.

4 star rating, just because I disagree with the techniques used, but Thanks for the recipe! This is my new, favorite biscuit.

This may become my go to biscuit recipe!  I used a stand mixer with a dough hook  to combine and knead the ingredients.  The recipe produces a light, airy biscuit that was perfect for biscuits and sausage gravy.  Will definitely make again.

I have made the biscuits about 10 times and my family loves them. The first time I made them they were a little doughy but that was due to my oven so I adjusted the cook time  and they come out perfect each time.

Every time I try to go beyond the 12 biscuit yield, the recipe is a bit faulty. I end up having to add around a couple more cups of flour just so the dough won't be uber sticky. The biscuit is delicious, but I may have to use high gluten flour if I make more than 12.

This has fast become my favorite biscuit recipe! I've been making the now, about twice a month for the last year and they go with anything! The only change I make is to up the buttermilk to a full cup, since I like them really moist and soft! Also, make sure you use real butter, no substitute will do! Wonderful!

These were really good. I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt and a little bit of milk to equal 3/4 cup. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese.

Very easy recipe and simply delicious. My daughter said she could eat these biscuits without butter, jelly or honey. They were so good just plain. No need for me to try any other biscuit recipe. YUMMM!

This was a very easy recipe and turned out really good!  I used organic whole wheat flour so I was worried they would be too dry  and "wheaty" tasting, however,  that was not the case.  I used whole milk with 1 T lemon juice to make buttermilk.  I did not knead for 2 minutes, just a few times until they were mixed.  I over-measured the sugar (a little extra) to add sweetness and hopefully contrast the wheat flour taste.  Added close to 1/2 tsp salt.  Undermeasured the flour by just a bit since wheat flour is more dense, and over-measured the buttermilk just a bit.  They are flaky and light, which is great!  The one thing I will do differently next time is make them thicker since they came out flatter than I would like.

For quick and easy biscuits these were delicious!  We had them with gravy.  My knife came out clean, but the middle biscuits were slightly doughy, so next time I will forget checking them with a knife and bake them a little longer until the tops get a nice golden color (maybe 20 minutes).  I love buttermilk biscuits, but with little kids, it's hard to take that much time to make this.  These were perfect, and the toddler helped!

These biscuits are amazing! I followed everyone's directions and I have to say these were better then any restaurant biscuits I've eaten. I took a biscuit after they came out of the oven and made egg sandwiches. So delicious and flaky. Yummy!

This is such a simple recipe. I followed it step by step and also included the other reviewer's tip about sifting the dry ingredients and folding instead of kneading. The result is a great flavor with tender layers that pull apart nicely and hungrily absorb our thick smotherings of honey butter. This will be my go to biscuit recipe. Thanks for posting it!

Nice biscuits that we had with sausage gravy poured over the top. For me, the biscuits took a few extra minutes than the recommended, but overall they were a great texture, not too dry. Will make again.

Every time I have left over buttermilk from other recipes, I make these biscuits for breakfast.  I've grated frozen butter and also just use fridge-cold butter and used a pastry cutter.

I mix all the dry ingredients and stir them up quite well.  I also find that I when I turn the dough out, I have to knead about twice as long as indicated to get it mixed well.  

I roll out to about 1/2" and use a circular cutter and then back for about 12 minutes.  We love them.

I make these as my go to biscuit.  A few things that really make a difference. Aluminum free baking powder, and I prefer unbleached flour. When cutting biscuits remember to cut clean through it. Don't mash the edges, they won't rise properly.

Because of food intolerances I had to give up my fluffy biscuit in a can about ten years ago. I've yet to find a recipe that came close - until this one. Granted, it's been 10 years, so if you had canned biscuits last night, they might not seem as similar to you, but.... 
I had pulled pork for lunch in the crock pot and realized at 1:30 that I had six hungry children, pork, and no bread. My kitchen is a disaster right now so it was easier to search AllRecipes than find my usual biscuit recipe. I had them in the oven in ten minutes. 
I pulled them out a little early, so they were a tad gooey. And they were too flakey to hold up for sandwiches, but we piled the pork on and ate them with a fork - to rave reviews from 5yo to 17 yo.

TASTY and FAST!  My scratch biscuits take a LOT longer to make, and they are great, but I was looking for a faster choice. These are fantastic!  I would cut the square into 9 biscuits to have bigger ones. Perfect crunch on outside, soft and tasty inside.

I halved this recipe because I am only cooking for me and the hubs . I put all the dry ingredients in my food processor and gave it a whirle, then I added the very very cold chopped butter, and pulsed till I had "sand." Finally I added the buttermilk  and pulsed the machine again until I got large crumbs and the dough started to come together. Then I plopped it on a plate shaped them into a rectangle and cut them into squares. Finally I placed the biscuits on my bakeing sheet and let them bake.  These biscuits came out very fluffy and slightly crumbly, just the way we like. The flavor is very nice and lightly sweet, so these are probably best suited as afternoon biscuits with jam and  butter as opposed to breakfast with gravy biscuits. I suppose if I cut the sugar in half the resulting biscuits will be a bit better suited as gravy mops. ;) Over all I think these puppies are really good and are worth a try.

I loved them, and my husband as well. Tender, fluffy. I just added a n additional teaspoon of sugar, suggested by my hubby, and let the dough rest a while; they came out delicious and perfect un coffee before breakfast. I'm making this again tomorrow morning!

Flavour was exactly what I was looking for. Nothing too strong, since it was going with a chicken slow cooker recipe. 

They seem a BIT spongey, but I think that's what the creator was going for.

Excellent!  I did what someone suggested about freezing the butter and grating it.  I also used 1 cup of buttermilk as suggested.  These were the best biscuits.

Would have been better if I had self rising flour. I used all purpose and they did not rise and become fluffy. They were still good though.

This  is the best biscuit recipe by far, I used the substitute of milk and vinegar  and they came out just as if it were the real thing this will be my only go to recipe for homemade biscuits.

Thanks for sharing

I've never done homemade biscuits and this was my first time. There is a terrible aftertaste to these. Other than that, they're fine.

My family loves these biscuits! I always make a double batch for biscuits and gravy. The only alteration I have to make is that I have to add vinegar to milk because I never have buttermilk on hand.  I let them sit for a few min after cutting before I bake them. The biscuits are big, heavy and perfect??

Made it exactly as written.  I didn't have store bought buttermilk so I added a tbsp of vinegar to whole milk.  Biscuits rose beautifully and were moist and tender on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside.  I slide unseparated biscuit dough onto a preheated baking stone and didn't really time them in the oven.  Just watched for the right golden brown color.  I think it did take a few minutes longer than the suggested 15 minutes.  They were perfect and I will make them again.

The flavor and texture was spot on. Like some of the other reviewers, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mine did not rise but I think that was my fault for following the original instructions to knead for 2 minutes. The fact that they were flat did not matter because they were piled high with sausage gravy. Great recipe!

I made these exactly to directions and they turned out so great! Will definitely be making them again. The only thing I guess I didn't do correctly was cutting before baking, because it took longer than the 15 mins it says in the recipe. More like 23. But like I said, maybe I'm not cutting properly. Overall, easy and delicious!

They were good. BUT!! I felt they didn't have enough butter and they definitely had too much buttermilk and maybe needed a hair less sugar, so just be cautious. But a solid base recipe that is a great jumping off point!!

I love this recipe and the taste of the biscuits are amazing.  However, I think the rating of the recipe should also be accuracy of cooking time and overall directions.  That being said, the biscuits take longer than 15 minutes to cook.  I even rolled my biscuits out larger than a 6x6 inch area to make them more flat.  These biscuits take more like 20-25 minutes to get the middle completely cooked.

ohhhh myyyy gravy. These are for sure the new go to biscuits. Flakey, crispy top and bottom, soft center. I rested them for 10 minutes before baking, and only kneaded 8ish times (instead of 2 whole minutes) per other reviewers recommendations.

Excellent basic buttermilk biscuit recipe. Knead time is not required . Once dough is formed roll out and slice or cut. Do not overwork or rework dough, otherwise you risk dough not rising to the nice fully consistency .

I made these exactly like the recipe and they are simple and delicious.  They have a laid back buttery flavor.  They will not be the prettiest biscuits you'll see but YUMMY.  They are perfect for complimenting a roast or using for biscuits and gravy.  The best part is, it might take you 5 minutes to prepare, 15 to bake and they are ready.  SO EASY. You will not regret it.

I do this recipe, yet drop the biscuits for biscuits and gravy. When I put in the dish and score, they are a bit too doughy for me.

5 stars with a couple of changes.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used a heaping tablespoon sour cream with enough milk to make the 3/4 cup needed. I prefer this substitution over vinegar/milk because it more closely matches buttermilk in thickness. Did not knead. Am I reading directions correctly...6x6 inches cut into 12 even sections? I made the square a bit larger, 12 sections still made the biscuits rather small, and I did separate the sections. Still had to cook an additional 5-7 minutes. End result was very light & moist with a nice crust. My teenage daughter who doesn't particularly care for biscuits, liked them very much.

The whole family liked the biscuits. We had with butter and honey, butter and sausage patty, egg and Canadian bacon. I will increase the salt to more than a dash (1/2 tsp). I will use cutter to make round biscuits next time.

2015.11.29 - My only mod was to use a splash of lemon with milk to make 3/4 cup instead of buttermilk.  Per other reviewers, I grated in the cold butter (great tip!  thanks, guys!) and folded the dough 9 - 12 times instead of kneading.  Rolled out to 6x6, I got a biscuit that was flaky on top, but too doughy inside (even after baking an additional 5 minutes).  These were still pretty good, though.  In the future, I will roll these out flatter, maybe to 9x6.

Just what I was looking for. These are easy and perfect! Family and guests agreed. I did still cut them into circles and place touching to bake, no square biscuits for us.

I didn't read many reviews so if people have already said some of these things, my apologies.  The biscuits were great!  I had to make two changes, the amount of buttermilk, I used one cup rather than 3/4 cup, and the cooking time, it took my biscuits 25 minutes, not 15 to cook.  After kneading the dough, I rolled it out to fit my 9x9 baking pan and then cut it into nine squares (tic,tac,toe) with my pizza cutter.  I also melted butter in the pan before adding the biscuits.  They were so yummy!  Thank you!

Grate the frozen butter, then put the bowl with the dry flour and butter mixture in the freezer for about 5 minutes.  Put the baking sheet in the freezer until you are ready to place your biscuits on it and bake them.  Everything stays cold, the butter stays nice and cold, and those biscuits come out of the oven so nice and flaky!  Yum!

This is my first time making biscuits and it came out perfectly! I had to use a substitute for buttermilk (1 cup milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice), but other wise followed the recipe exactly. The reason for 4 stare: they're a bit bland. I'll brush them with butter and/or sugar next time.

This is a great easy and quick biscuit recipe! They turned out flakey and perfect! I've made these several times and they've turned out every time. The key is to make sure your butter is nice and cold and that you don't overwork the dough. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Best biscuits I've ever made. These remind me of my grandmother's biscuits so much. I'll never use another recipe, because this is my official one now.

I have been using a biscuit recipe with at least twice as much butter and salt. I like this recipe better and don't miss the extra fat at all! The texture is great and it was very easy to make. Mine were done after 10 minutes so keep an eye on them so they don't burn. The only other thing I differently was use 2% milk instead of buttermilk because that's what I had. Oh yeah, and if you are like me and didn't read the whole recipe before you separated the dough into little balls, don't worry, it will turn out fine.

I found it very easy to follow direction and overall make. The ingredients are simple and very little, so that's a plus. The only thing I did differently which I regret is: Cutting recipe in half, I should have made more because they taste that amazing. But then again I'm glad I didn't because they would all be gone. Also, I let the biscuits sit for 15 minutes :) But I regret forming them into a circle and cutting them but not diving them. I should have made them into a square like the directions said because they were oddly shaped.

I made these yesterday for my son's birthday breakfast and now I have a double batch ready to go in the oven for dinner! Very easy to make, especially with my Ninja! Very buttery! They are like something from a good restaurant! I haven't needed to change anything in this recipe yet, but I love reviewers who share their modifications; that's one of the reasons why I read reviews

No changes made....did find they took longer to bake...taste is a bit different than other biscuits. [to me] Will make them again with regular milk next time.  Good texture and height. Certainly easier than other recipes since no cutting out is required.

this was simple and tasty...I would've liked my biscuits to be more golden on the tops but that might've been my mistake.  I'll have to make them again to tell.

Best biscuits I've ever made!! So light and fluffy, yet perfect with sausage gravy!  I did omit the sugar because I wanted them to be more savory. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

8 25 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/85594/kentucky-biscuits/ ... These are good, very good; good for butter, honey; not so much for sausage - only because they are soft, fluffy.  Soft, fluffy in a good way, just not so easily cut to slide a piece of sausage (or whatever) in.  I like the different method of cutting/shaping.  These came out lightcolored, but still fully baked.  I subbed butterflavor shortening & increased salt to half t.  I probably added half cup more (White Lily) flour - including the shelf ... 2 25 17 Good biscuits!  Doubled the recipe & got 16 biscuits, using a 15oz can as  a cutter.  Before baking, close to (1/2" to) 3/4".  Maybe the not-good-for-sausage thing was just because they weren't thick enough.  Well, part of it because they are soft - but delicious.  :) Soooo, 4 1/2c flour, 5t bp, 1t salt, 1t soda, 2T sugar, 1c shortening, 1 1/2c buttermilk... 2 28 17 ... I tried these ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/234033/sadies-buttermilk-biscuits/ ... & I can't decide which is better.  I just can't!  :D  I added an additional 2/3c flour to the bowl (Sadie's) to help with stickiness.  I'm wondering if a bit more salt & a li'l sugar would be "it"!  :)

Very happy with how they came out and I even used the wrong kind of flour (accidentally). Kids loved them. Will definitely make again.  I cut them and made proper biscuits rather than just cutting the loaf.

These were good. The baking powder taste referred to by someone else can be almost eliminated by using aluminum free baking powder. I have noticed a big difference since using it.

I had no buttermilk so I found a milk/vinegar recipe for that. Other than actual "buttermilk" I made this recipe exactly as is.  They were wonderful! I couldn't believe how delicious, soft and moist they were. Real buttermilk could only make them better and I'm already giving this 5 stars!

My go to for biscuits!  I sometimes need to add just a bit more buttermilk. I find that different brands can be thicker than others so you really need to look for consistency. Only kneed 12 times. I cook mine in a cast iron after cutting with a biscuit cutter. Flaky and perfect everytime.

Seriously the best biscuits I've ever tasted. the best things about them are the crisp crust on the top and bottom of the biscuit, and the flaky texture. Only things I did differently were...1. I didn't knead the dough, just mixed it with my hands long enough for it to come together. 2. I made sure my butter and buttermilk were icy cold before adding. 3. I put a small pat of butter on top of each biscuit before baking. Amazing!!! Had them with homemade sausage gravy, but can't wait to try them with other things as well.

This recipe was easy & delicious.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I substituted with a mixture of 3/4 milk & 2 Tbs. white vinegar.  Also used spenda in place of sugar. The changes worked out wonderfully & the biscuits turned out great.

This is my favorite 'flat biscuit' recipe. When I want crumbly biscuits I can break up with my fingers for biscuits and gravy, I look elsewhere, but if I want a thinner, sturdier biscuit I can slice in half and coat with butter, jelly, or honey THIS IS IT. I've also used this recipe as a "crust" for biscuit based casseroles.

I have made these two times now.  The first time I substituted lard for the butter and acidfied cream for the buttermilk.  Both times the biscuits were melt in your mouth delicious.  My new standard for biscuits.

I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted watered down sour cream. I cut in circles and placed close together in cake pan. They were very good - moist, flaky and not too dense. Would make again!

This was a great recipe.  I replaced my other drop biscuit recipe with this one and will use it as my go-to biscuit.  As the poster said, these are great hot out of the oven with butter, jam or honey.  I used these as the base for Bill's Sausage Gravy (also on allrecipes) and it made a great breakfast.

My only tip to add is to use your fool processor w/ the blade to do the sifting and butter incorporation work. First, put dry ingredients in and pulse a dozen times. Then add butter and pulse until combined. Finally, pour in the butter milk and pulse a few more times until it comes together. I am hooked.

Substituted 1/2 of the white flour with golden flax meal and almond meal to make it a little more paleo. Increased baking time to 17 minutes because the almond meal adds extra moisture. Also substituted a combination of homemade yogurt and whey for buttermilk. Still delicious. I love the fact no rolling out is necessary. These also freeze really well. You can take one out of the freezer, pop it in the microwave, and it tastes almost as good straight from the oven.

Great easy recipe!  I didn't have buttermilk , so added 1T of white vinegar to 3/4 C milk and let it sit about 5 minutes before using.  I also had to add about 1/4 C of flour as I was kneading it because the dough was too sticky.  But the end result was great!  Light, Fluffy, and great taste!

This recipe I followed to the T.but they did not brown n did not rise. I even sifted the dry ingredients and let them set for 15 minutes. I feel I  can find better recipe, but thanks for the experience.

These biscuits are SO good! I used frozen butter and grated it like other reviewers suggested. They turned out so moist and perfect! My husband especially loves them. Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recioe! I did use some suggestions that I found on the comments. One change I made was that I froze the butter before, and when I need to add it in, I grated it. Also, I added 1/4 tsp of salt and I needed it for only about one minute instead of two.For me this turned out great. Besides that I wouldn't change anything about it.

I made these for breakfast this morning. My husband loves them and he's a biscuit snob??. They are very tender. I grated the frozen butter and used buttermilk substitute. I would bake them a little longer next time.  I will be making them with Beef Stew tomorrow for family.

This recipe is my favorite biscuit recipe! I would use it again in a heartbeat, the only problem was that I had to put them in for a little more time than it said, but most of my baking goes that way. Anyone who is having doubts about using this. Don't!

I have never made biscuits before, but was inspired while watching food network this morning!  I found this recipe and had most of the ingredients on hand, and decided the give it a shot.  I did not have buttermilk, and after googling buttermilk substitutes I used a mix of one part milk to 3 parts plain yogurt.  I wasn't sure what to expect from my substitute, but these turned out amazing!  They have a slight crunch on the outside and are fluffy and moist on the inside!  I'll have to try them with buttermilk sometime, but they turned out so well with yogurt that I wouldn't hesitate to use it again!  Best biscuits I have ever tasted!  I also took another reviewers advice and only kneaded them 12 times or so (not 2 minutes as the recipe states).  You could tell just when the dough held together in a smooth ball that it was ready to roll out and cut.  I don't think I will be buying biscuit dough at the store ever again!

When I tried to transfer the biscuits to a serving plate the outside crumbled everywhere, while the inside of the biscuit was thoroughly cooked but still doughy. I made the recipe exact, and even sifted all the dry ingredients. The flavor was good though, so I will attempt these again and alter recipe based on reviews to see if it helps.

I love the recipe.  However I did not prepare it the way the recipe suggests.  I freeze and grate the butter then I used the technique in Chef John's buttermilk biscuit recipe of minimal mixing and then folding into thirds on the cutting board, refolding, and then refolding again before cutting.  I used the ingredients from this recipe because I like it just a little bit better; I think it's the sugar.

I'll be the first one to say that I'm much more adept at the Pillsbury biscuit method than I am at doing biscuits from scratch. That said, I see the reviewers' debates about how much to knead, but my dough ended up being WAY too gooey. Kneading was out of the question. I added some flour, to no avail. So it was kind of weird. The final product turned out OK, but I couldn't give it 5 stars.

I've made this recipe a few times now, and my husband and I agree, it is the best biscuit recipe on this site.  I don't usually keep buttermilk on hand, so I have used various combinations of milk, sour cream, and lemon juice (including sometimes zest).  Recipe will accept seasoning additions also, and 1/2 cup or more finely grated cheese.  I have also made up the dough and placed on the cooking sheet, then popped into the fridge the night before, so I can just bake in the morning.  Yum!

Made just as recipe said and loved them. We usually use Grands rolls for biscuits and gravy but had buttermilk that needed used so I chose this recipe. Very easy to make and well worth the effort. Although the 6x6 inch size struck me as odd - it worked great. My husband raved about these and they were great warmed up with honey and butter the next morning.

Love this recipe!! However I have modified it in my own way.  Instead of of granulated sugar, I use 2 TBS of powdered sugar, I use marg. instead of butter. Because I have a hard time keeping buttermilk in the fridge, I take skim and add a tablespoon of sour cream for a 3/4C measurement.  Now at times I will add herbs and spices pending on what I am pairing the biscuits up with.   But I love this base recipe and everyone raves on my biscuits, so thank you for this recipe and have loved playing around with it and modifying it to my own :)

I don't bake at all. This is the first time baking biscuits and they turn out great. My kids love them.

Fabulous recipe! Golden, flaky biscuits and very easy. I always have instant buttermilk powder in the fridge. Definitely don't have to knead for two while minutes. One thing I didn't understand was the direction to roll into a 6" x 6" square and cut into 12??? That would make very tiny, very tall biscuits! I made about a 9" square and cut into 9 sections.

I followed the recipe to a 't' and the flavor was good, but I felt they were very dense and had to cook closer to 20 minutes. They went well with biscuits and gravy, but the texture wouldn't be very good if eaten alone.

I love this recipe!  My son asks for biscuits and gravy almost every weekend since I found it.  I cut them into 6 biscuits instead of 12 though.  He is a 14 year old boy and wants a bigger biscuit!

These are delicious and my go-to biscuit recipe.  Sifted three times as recommended by another reviewer.  Added 1 tbsp of vinegar to my milk and let it sit 5 minutes because I didn't have buttermilk.  These were very good.  Soft and had an almost melt in your mouth texture.

I have really had a craving for old fashioned comfort food lately and these biscuits really hit the spot.  The texture was exactly what I was looking for.  The only thing I will change the next time (and there WILL be a next time!) is cutting the sugar or omitting altogether.

Excellent base recipe. I substituted hemp milk for buttermilk and used organic pastry flour instead of all purpose flour. 

Instead of rolling it out, I just made 10 equal sized balls and flattened them into 3 inch diameter flat cakes. After about 18 minutes, i check the bottom and they were ready.

I left a few in for an extra five minutes for a nice crispy shell.

On a whim, I woke up this morning and wanted to make biscuits. I found this recipe and though I didn't have buttermilk,  rather whole milk, they turned out fantastic!  My new go-to biscuit recipe.

Adjusted recipe to 6 servings to make 7 servings of Monkey Bread Kabobs. Worked out great and the kidlets loved them. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste it as is because of the sugar, cinnamon, and butter but the taste was good in general.

These turned out great, very fluffy and moist on the inside. However, instead of greasing a cookie sheet, I put parchment paper down.......BAD IDEA!! Burnt the bottom of them and smoked my house up! The paper was black, I've used the paper before with cookies and this never happened.

Made these for a dinner party last month, everyone seemed to really like them, much like drop biscuits.  They were pretty easy to make, but I did have to add quite a bit of flour when kneading them so they would come together.

Yum, Yum, Yum! Made these for dinner, and the dough was soooo soft- like a baby's bottom. I kneaded the dough several times, and instead of making them square, I rolled out the dough and cut with round cutter. After baking, the tops were brushed with melted butter. So soft, so yummy, so darn delicious!  Next time I makes these, I will use all butter rather than a butter-Crisco combination and 1/8 tsp salt. I too had to make the buttermilk (vinegar mixed with whole milk). This recipe is a KEEPER! No more box biscuit mixes for me.

Excellent ! I am from Kentucky, and  I make these all the time and have even used regular milk in a pinch! (Not as good as buttermilk but it gets the job done).  These are just like my Mother's and Grandmothers and what I grew up with. Some reviewers have mentioned that the middle does not get done, which is probably true if you are following the recipe exactly. I cut them like the recipe says but slightly pull them apart so there is a small space between each of them or if I have time I use my round cookie cutter and cut them out instead. Leaving them clumped together will cause the outer biscuits to get hard and the inner biscuits to still not be done. These are perfect for good old fashioned sausage or bacon gravy which my whole family devours when I make it for Sunday breakfast!

Delicious! I used whole wheat flour and used 4 Tbsp. butter and 4 Tbsp Greek yogurt (instead of 8 Tbsp.of butter for a healthier biscuit. I mixed yogurt in buttermilk) Thank-you for the recipe!

I found these biscuits to be easy and delicious. I used frozen butter and shaved it fairly thin with a knife. It incorporated well with the flour without stickiness. When rolling out the biscuits, I will try to leave more height around the edges, as the center seemed to rise up more and created outter edges that cooked quicker than the center. Recipe made enough for dinner and breakfast the next morning. They were fluffy and soft reheated.

Didn't have regular milk, just almond milk so I soured some with a little apple cider vinegar (for about 1 hour). Don't really taste any difference (between buttermilk and almond milk), seems a little bland not quite buttery enough. I used unsalted butter but did not include more salt to make up for it. I think that might help the flavor a little bit.

This batch will definitely require something accompanying them (strawberry jam and honey tasted great) to make up for the bland flavor. the outside is the perfect crumbly crunch for a biscuit (and is actually pretty tasty) but the inside lacks in flavor. They fluffed up a little bit, not much so don't spread too thin.

A big key to consistent cooking time for these biscuits is in the kind of pan you use.   A dark, cast iron pan is going to bake these up very quickly---whereas a stainless steel jelly roll or clear, glass casserole will bake more slowly.  Yummy!

Very easy recipe.  I've tried to make biscuits before and they turned out too dense, but this recipe was very easy to follow.  The men in my family loved these biscuits.  They are plain, but would probably be great with honey or with cheese added.

Simple, easy to make, and delicious.  I let them bake until they were a little crispy, but the inside was light, which pleased my husband and me.  Definitely will be making these biscuits often.

I use this recipe to make biscuits for strawberry shortcake as well as regular breakfast biscuits. One helpful suggestion from another reviewer was to freeze the butter and grate it in. This was such a helpful tip and worked well. If I am in a pinch and do not have time to freeze the butter I just grate directly into the mixing bowl the minute I take it out of the fridge and it works just as good.  Also, even though the recipe calls for buttermilk I prefer making a buttermilk substitute. I just add one tablespoon of vinegar to one cup of milk and let it sit for five minutes and use whatever amount is needed. This is helpful if you don't use buttermilk on a regular basis. To be honest, I prefer the substitute and think the biscuits taste better. I also melt butter and brush it onto the biscuits before I put it in the oven and while they are cooking.

I have a love/hate relationship with any recipes that involve dough, but this was quick, easy, and had amazing results. Doubled the recipe with no problems - all 24 biscuits were devoured in no time at all, complete with a fight over who got the last one.

A slight modification I'd make for next time: I'd separate the biscuit a bit before baking. The recommended baking time is 15 minutes, but even after 20 the inside biscuits were a bit doughy in the middle. Had to separate and throw back in the oven to get them totally done.

But really, I've tried several biscuit recipes and this one is a keeper.

I made this recipe with the ingredients exactly as directed. I did cut my biscuits with a biscuit cutter just because of personal preference.  Since there were no directions about how to handle the dough, I did follow Chef John's directions about the quarter folds.  I rolled them and and cut with a biscuit cutter. The beauty of rolling the dough out, folding; and repeating results in a light, fluffy biscuit in which you can actually see the layers to the biscuit.I couldn't believe the difference the sugar makes. Plus, I baked in a convection oven.  Absolutely brown ad crispy on the outside, and that's the way we like them--with a brown crust.  The only way I will ever make buttermilk biscuits again.  Thank you for sharing!

I have tried many biscuit recipes and this is the best. They were all my family talked about at breakfast! I have a large family so I had to double the recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk but I did use buttermilk powder, it works out to be the same. Turned out with a nice crust and tender in the middle. Since I doubled the recipe, they baked for about 25 minutes. Yummy!!

Best biscuits I have ever made.  My butter was frozen but I was able to cut it up small enough it worked!  Also I didn't have real buttermilk so I made some with vinegar added to whole milk-(I do it all the time and works great)  Love these biscuits hot out of the oven with Vanilla Pear butter!

Just made these for breakfast.  Followed recipe but cut them into rounds. They baked up quickly and I had to reduce the oven temp to 375 after just a few minutes.  I could tell they would get too brown.  As it was, the bottoms were a little scorched.  I sliced them off at the bottom before serving with the Kentucky Bacon Milk Gravy.  Taste was amazing and texture was very much like KFC biscuits. Will probably make again.

Yum! I usually use Bisquick to make biscuits (with poor results) and now I never will again. This was easy and so good. Nice and light. I used wheat flour and the milk/vinegar mix with great results. Thanks!

A simple recipe with moist tender biscuits as a result. Made a half batch for just the two of us and wound up eating too much. Had no buttermilk, so soured milk with vinegar.

Yay. This is fantastic. Thank you so much. Works well with gluten-flour flour mix (rice/oat/starches) as well as "homemade" buttermilk (almond milk plus vinegar). Love love love these. Came out fantastic!!

Perfect biscuits! I used "home made" buttermilk, and I made sure my butter was very cold. They came out flaky and delicious!

BEST BISCUITS I'VE EVER MADE!!!!! Make sure all ingredients are VERY cold (my buttermilk had ice crystals). I actually used self rising flour (cuz that's what we do in the south!) I also cut my biscuits out as my husband has issue with non round ones.  Will definitely make again.

These are delicious!  I grated the butter like someone suggested, didn't over knead them, and let them set before baking.  Oh my goodness I ate about 5 of them in a minute.  They are really buttery and flaky.

I'm an excellent baker, but haven't been able to produce a decent biscuit...till now.  Followed the recipe exactly, and am pleased.  Not thrilled, but happy to have a pleasant tasting, fluffy, not dry biscuit.  I combined the ingredients in a food processor and hand mixed the dough only until it held together well, not 2 min.  I will try cutting it with a biscuit cutter next time, and brushing with butter.

Pretty good texture, but not much on flavor.  I used salted butter, but I think this could've used even more salt, along with more sugar and more buttermilk.

Even though I've never attempted to make biscuits before, I hope the next recipe I use turns out better than this one did.  I followed the instructions exactly, except that I had to bake for an extra 20 minutes because they were still doughy inside - the exterior had a nice crisp to it but they weren't edible because they didn't cook throughout - and no, it's not because my oven wasn't warm enough, everything else bakes fine.  I ended up throwing them out.  Not impressed at all.

Super easy.  So flaky and buttery.  All the ingredients were on hand (nothing fancy like self rising flour or shortening which I don't usually have).

For someone who hasn't made a whole lot of homemade biscuits, this was a quick and easy recipe.  Biscuits were perfect for the sausage gravy and good just with butter. I will keep this as a go to quick  biscuit recipe, bye, bye, bisquick!

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  Didn't have buttermilk so I put 1 Tbs lemon juice plus enough milk to make 1 c.  Was distracted so I put the whole cup in and it was perfect!  I am tempted however to subtract a star for the fact that these aren't very good the next day.

This is a nice soft biscuit - not flaky but tall and pillowy with a nice crunch to top and bottom. Kind of like a KFC biscuit but not full of chicken fumes, or like a 7Up biscuit but not sweet. I tried the grating frozen butter trick one reviewer mentioned but just gunked up my salad shooter - woops! Will try again with a longer freeze time because it's pretty nifty having little butter noodles to incorporate rather than breaking down a whole cube. Overall, a solid contender for a go-to biscuit recipe!

This was the best recipe for biscuits I have tried from this site. My husband loved them. They were flake with nice crisp tops and bottoms. I made my own butter milk with 3/4 cup of milk and two tablespoons of vinegar.
Great!

Perfect, absolutely sensational. I have thrown out my other biscuit recipes. In fact, I've started making these less because as soon as they're out of the oven, we become total gluttons and eat most everything on the plate. The key I believe is the cutting. Be sure to follow the directions there. I brush with cream before popping them in the oven - but this is really just a personal preference. Thanks so much.

Delicious! I didn't have buttermilk though. I let 3/4 cup of milk mixed with 1 tbs of white vinegar sit for a few minutes, then I added it to the mix as directed in the instructions for this recipe. They came out great!

These were decent, but just didn't turn out quite like I thought they would.  I might try making them again with a little less butter.
This was my first attempt at homemade biscuits, so considering that, they were pretty good :-)

these are terrific! easy to make, love that you don't have to cut them out.  I followed the recipe exactly - my oven I baked them about 16 min.  Thank you to whoever posted the tip to grate the butter into the flour mix, so much easier!!

These were amazing! I have to admit that I made them vegan (earth balance and soy milk mixed with vinegar) besides that I didn't change a thing and they came out amazing. They were fluffy and light and everything a biscuit should be. 
Another important criteria is that they should still taste good the next day and these just blew my mind since they tasted even better the day after. 
Keeping this recipe never making another one again!

Amazing.  They do taste very much like KFC.  Crispy on the outside, soft and flaky inside.  I made them in my Kitchenaid mixer, cutting in the butter by adding it slice by slice while it mixed (this is the easiest way I've found to cut butter).  Then I kneaded it with the bread hook for a couple of minutes.  The dough was perfect.  Ate with the sausage gravy I recipe from this site.  Yum.  Thanks!

The biscuits were good, but definitely needed salt.  Next time I will add more.  A dash wasn't near enough.

These are so delicious! Buttery and pretty much perfect....this will be my go to recipe for biscuits now!  One thing I noticed is that the servings are wrong, by about half.  I doubled this recipe & it made 25 mini biscuits.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 the butter in the dough, kneaded until smooth, added shredded cheddar cheese and garlic salt. Very soft, fluffy and super yummy! I used remaining butter top brush on the top of the biscuits.

Made these to go with the Boston Baked Beans from this site - wonderful!  I followed the recipe almost to the letter, with two exceptions:  I only kneaded the dough for about 45 seconds (long enough for it to look "right"), and in my oven it took about 18 minutes to finish. Thanks much for sharing!

I just made these biscuits and I am very pleased. I added more salt and added a bit more flour when i began kneading because my dough was more of a batter/dough. I also added butter to the top of my biscuits after taking them out of the oven just to soften the top a bit. I will be making these again.

I like this recipe exactly as it is written. Flavorful and flaky with good texture. Equally good rolled or dropped. I sometimes add 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and 1/8 tsp italian seasoning to the flour/butter mixture before adding the buttermilk. I have substituted plain milk when I was out of buttermilk and the taste was okay, but not great.

This recipe is really good. The only thing I changed was to make sure the butter is cut in chunks and lightly mixed in, and instead of kneading the dough for 2 minutes (which makes the biscuits dense and tough) loosely pack them together individually into the biscuit shape and cook. They come out flaky and yummy (with the easiness of Kentucky biscuits)

Wonderful!  Light, super fluffy, tender. Exactly what I was looking for. Had to use a bit more buttermilk than recipe called for to get it to set up and combine. Also used frozen butter that I grated with box grater, then used pastry blender just a bit. Was a small pain but worth it.  Patted it into a rectangle on my floured granite, folded into thirds a few times and reformed. Cut into 12 squares with a pastry cutter and baked all touching. So good with Amish butter and honey!!! Next time I'll add a touch more salt to the dough.

This recipe is very forgiving.  Ok... so I tried to follow the directions, but made one big mistake.  I didn't have any buttermilk so made some with one cup milk and tablespoon fresh lemon juice.  I made these biscuits for breakfast during the week for my family.  As most Mom's know...things are way busy in the weekday.  Lunches, diapers, hair needing combed on and on. Well after a major distraction, I came back to whip up the biscuits and poured the entire cup of buttermilk into the mix. When I was trying to get the mix on to the counter it hit me. Wow! This stuff sure is wet.  After a few *#@! realizing I had added too much milk I just pressed on and put them in the oven.  They didn't turn out like I am sure they are suppose to, but everyone raved! Thanks for a great recipe! Maybe I can get it right next time:)

These are utterly fantastic. Any time my husband makes happy yummy sounds and asks when I can make more of something, I know the recipe is good. I still need to figure out the best way of shaping and cutting the dough, and I'd put in 1/2 a tsp of salt instead of a dash. Otherwise, these are really good!

I almost followed the recipe "to a T," but added a wee bit more salt than just a dash to balance out the sweetness of the dough. It made for some very light and flavorful biscits. I definitely would not substitute "homemade" for the real deal when it comes to using buttermilk. I was questioning the math beforehand about how many biscuits the recipe would make. And I was correct. The recipe, patted into an exact 6x6-inch square made just 4 large (3-inch) biscuits). I used a pizza cutter. I can't imagine the tiny biscuits that cutting the dough into 12 would make. If I could, I would give the recipe a 5-star rating for ease & taste, and just 3 stars for math/# servings.

These turned out excellent.  I grated the butter and added less sugar because they were being served with gravy.  I also kneaded them for less time, about a minute.  I think they could be very versatile.  I think I'm going to try them with a little extra sugar to go with jam.  Very flaky and light.

I had some leftover buttermilk and decided to look up a recipe for buttermilk biscuits and found this one.  I made them for my girlfriend and my daughter and they absolutely loved them.  They melt in your mouth and are light and fluffy.  Best homemade biscuits I've ever made.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with the rest of the world.  :)

Pretty good. My biscuits never rise as much as in the picture. Maybe 1/2 an inch. I didn't handle the dough any more than necessary. They still tasted good with my chicken and gravy dinner. A little dry though. I would add more salt.

Very much like KFC biscuits! A little on the small side though. Let them rest 10-15 min. before baking for a little extra lift. All in all a perfect go-to biscuit recipe!

These were fantastic & so easy to make!  Very similar in taste/texture to "the Colonel's."  I halved the recipe the first time to accommodate just the 3 of us & the biscuits were perfect.  I love them smothered with sausage gravy, though they are just as delicious with a little butter.  I've found that allowing the dough to rise for at least 10-15 minutes before baking allows for an even fluffier biscuit.  This is officially my go-to recipe for biscuits.

Absolutely fabulous biscuits! I've made the recipe twice now and it's very easy! Just don't over-knead the dough! Also, ran out of regular sugar the second time around so I substituted 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead, AWESOME!!

YUM.  Made these tonight with my kitchenaid mixer and it was SO easy.  They turned out great--they do taste very similar to KFC biscuits, although these were lighter, fluffier, more melt in your mouthier!  Definitely will be making these again...

I didn't roll them out evenly, my mistake, but despite my mistake, they still came out great, I stuck the knife in the center and it didn't come out clean so I added an extra five minutes and it was great. The small pieces on the end weren't over cooked either.

These biscuits are delicious and so easy to make.  I sifted 3 times as reccommended by AnnainOK, mixed the butter into the flour mixture in my stand mixer, and kneaded minimally, just enough to mix the wet and dry ingredients.  They came out perfect and now I am making them a second night in a row!

A decent starting place if you've never made biscuits from scratch. Used exact ingredients, but made drop biscuits instead...not bad, but dry. With some tweaking, they turned out just fine.

My daughter (12) has been making these for breakfast for a year or so now and we haven't gotten tired of this recipe. We use white wheat for the flour and cane sugar which I think tastes better than white. They are a little denser with the whole wheat but very tasty and maybe just a little bit healthier :)

excellent biscuits, they just take a little longer to cook than advertised. I subbed 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flower to make them just a little healthier, and Splenda for the sugar made no difference in taste at all. mmmm :)

These were really good.  I added some cheese and garlic as well and they were so moist and airy.  I usually use the JP Biscuit recipe but will continue using this for the airiness of these.  They went well with my homemade pea soup!!

This was my first time making biscuits from scratch! Easy to follow. I should have used salted butter. I think they maybe would have been a bit better with anbit more salt. 
I did use regular milk and they still came out good, so if that's all you have in the house. And I added rosemary. Yummy! My 3 year old loved them :)

I followed the recipe to a "T" and they turned out wonderful! But it is impossible to make "12 even sections out of a 6x6 square". I made 9 even sections and my family enjoyed them with chicken stew for dinner. The next morning we had them with butter and jam with our breakfast! I will be making these more often.

The biscuits tasted good, but I think it was too much butter.  I would think 2/3 stick of butter per cup of flour would be a better proportion.  The biscuits came out decidedly yellow and too moist... more like undercooked pie dough than biscuits.

Just made these.  Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't knead them too much at all... just folded to bring it together.

I also used 1Tbs of vinegar in regular milk since I was out of buttermilk, and there is a big storm here on the east coast so no trips to the store.

These biscuits came out awesome!  Very light and puffy.  Perfect flavor for a basic recipe.  

Thanks for the recipe and I hope everyone out there gives these a try... you can do a lot with this recipe if you are looking for a more advanced version, like cheddar biscuits or more hearty savory types.

Just what I was looking for- simple, easy, not greasy, and yummy!  I didn't have buttermilk, so substituted milk and cream opf tartar.  They probably would have been perfect with the buttermilk- thus 5 stars.

This recipe is a keeper. Super easy.  I was looking for a biscuit recipe without shortening.  This one is great! I baked it a little longer than 15 minutes, though my oven is unreliable.

This biscuit was tasteless, also I followed the instructions to a T, and the middle biscuits were gummy. I would definitely separate before baking these so the biscuits can bake and not be gummy in the middle, actually, I will not use this recipe again.

Doesn't quite yield a dozen...could maybe use a little more flour (i had to knead more into mine).  But the taste of these biscuits is really good!  These are not dry at all. This is going in my recipe box.  The consistency is perfect...exactly what I expect in a biscuit!

I finally found a keeper! It took me a few tries, but I've got it down. I live at a high altitude and had to add 1/3 cup milk. I put them in the refrigerater 15 min before baking. Turned out great. Just be patient. It might take a few tries.

If biscuits could go to heaven, these would definately go to hell.  Cause there is no way that biscuits that are this good be good at heart.  Light, fluffy, and moist.  Even doing up large batches the recipe didn't waver.  Thank you soo much COOKIN4MY3BOYS for this recipe.  It's awesome.

AWESOME! I've been looking for a good biscuit recipe for a while now. All of them turned out too flat, dry and not nearly buttery enough... these were perfect! I did not separate them the first time and the ends were crunchier. Foe breakfast biscuits, I would suggest molding the dough into flat balls for a better shape.

These were okay. They turned out a little flat and didn't quite have the biscuity taste I was looking for. This may have been because I only had half butter/half smart balance sticks on hand.

I was disappointed with this one.  They baked beautifully, were light, moist and had a great texture, but tasted like nothing.  I kept getting the baking powder taste with bites of plain biscuit and not the buttery/savory flavor I was hoping for.  They were definitely missing some key ingredient to make them KFC like.  I'll keep searching for a keeper, this isn't it.

These were delicious, although maybe a little sweeter than I would want.  Next time I will use less sugar, maybe half, and about a 1/4 tsp of salt.  Other than that they were delicious.  I will also note that the middles weren't done after 15 min.

Fabulous!! I was looking for a new biscuit recipe and found it! Very moist, not dry at all.  Also, it was much easier than cutting each individual biscuit out.

WOW!  I made these?  Fifty years of making baking powder biscuits and I finally get the recipe for excellent supper biscuits. Family says to keep the "normal" biscuits for breakfast, though, with lots of good gravy.

Wow!  I've been making angel biscuits for years and I've finally found a recipe that beats my recipe.  This recipe is so much easier and the results are unbelievable......I doubled the recipe and made 2 sets of biscuits for my brood.  The only change to the recipe was to add 3/4 tsp. salt and a bit more buttermilk.  Excellent.....

These biscuits were over the top! They were crusty on top and moist and soft on the inside.  The only change I made was to add a little more than 1/2 tsp. of salt. Cooking time and ingredients were exactly right.   Anyone who likes a good biscuit won't be disapointed

Somehow this went terribly wrong. I was so excited to make biscuits from scratch and after reading all the reviews thought this was fail-proof. Nope. They were flat and tasted like baking powder. I made it as described - even grated ice cold butter. I may try again someday....

Tasted very strongly of baking powder and took a full ten minutes longer to bake than the recipe called for. Even cutting the kneading time substantially, they still came out tough as well.

I can't say these our my favorite.  I'm going to keep looking for a biscuit recipe.  They weren't bad. A little dense and I recommend making these big. Give them a try others love this and they are easy.

These are so easy and sooooo good. I am a big fan of crispy food, so the outside of these biscuits is exactly what I wanted. I'm sure I could eat the entire outside myself! I can't wait to try them with some variations - parmesan, herb, even adding some grated lemon ring would be good. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I love the recipe.  However, I'm a tried and true Big Orange, Univ of Tennessee Vols Fan...so I improvised by adding one cup of grated cheddar cheese (orange) and making the biscuits in the shape of Tennessee.  We now have "Tennessee Biscuits".  Ha.  They are good only because the Kentucky Biscuit recipe is good...highly recommend!!!

I had never made biscuits before and was thrilled with the results of this easy, delicious recipe!  As suggested by a pp, I used grated frozen butter the second time I made these with good results.  Because I don't usually have buttermilk around, I have been using my standard substitution: 2 Tbs. sourcream thinned with a tsp. of lemon juice per 1 cup of lowfat milk.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

These were good, but i've made better. The cutting/baking method was super easy and i liked the final result.  I will try that method everytime i make biscuits.  Not nearly as messy as using a biscuit cutter.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've tried so far!  I used the tip Pam51 gave by grating a frozen stick of butter into the flour mixture and I didn't knead it much at all.  This is the first time my biscuits actually came out flaky- with lots of moist delicious layers.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Only got 6 bisuits out of the recipe & I didn't bake them long enough, little heavy in the middle.  All in all, the biscuits were good and will try again.

These were just okay. Kind of bland. I expected them to be softer and more buttery like some of the ones I've eaten before.

These were good. I cut out with a biscuit cutter instead of using the 'do not separate' method. Next time I will try them the way the recipe states. (Love that pic, BTW!) ~Tan~

These were okay.  They were dense and kind of hard, but probably because it called for butter instead of shortening.

Love, love, love this one!  My husband, two year old daughter and I eat an entire batch of these with the Beef Stew IV recipe on this site.  Fresh from the oven and smothered in honey they are just irresistable!

So Tasty!  We moved to a high-altitude location and since I've had problems making my "tried and true" Bisquick recipe.  So, I made this recipe just as the recipe was written and we enjoyed every bite...even better than my old recipe, and not much more difficult.  Will make again and again.

Great with beef stew. I didn't find them dense at all. I added 1/4tsp instead of a "dash" of salt.

I think these would be better to leave out the baking soda and up the baking powder to 3 teaspoons with more than a dash of salt.

These were perfect.  I did add 1/4 t. salt rather than a dash but otherwise followed the ingredients exactly.  Barely kneaded the dough, just pressed together and turned in the bowl a few times to make sure everything was incorporated, minimal handling.  Rolled out on the counter approximately 12x12" because I wanted more of them and cut out in about 3" circles.  When done, they were only about 1/2" high doing it this way (duh).  I will try the 6x6" as stated next time for a "loftier" biscuit.  Great taste.  Thanks for a true classic!

I made it twice exactly to the recipe and we didn't like them either time! We didn't like the taste but the consistancy and texture was okay.  It tasted too much like baking powder.

I didn't understand the rolling directions 6x6 cut 12. So I rolled them and used a glass to cut them in 12. I might make them again. The taste was o.k. but I'll still search for the perfect biscuit.

I used whole milk since that was the closest thing to Buttermilk that I had on hand. I will use just a tad more that 3/4 cup next time, though. Served warm with jam, they were a big hit at the dinner table. Even my picky toddler ate 2!

I don't know, maybe I'm just not a good biscuit maker.  I followed the recipe exactly but maybe I should have kneaded the dough longer because although they were flaky (more like crumbly), they seemed a bit heavy for a biscuit and sometimes I could taste the faint taste of baking powder in them.

Ridiculously easy and wonderfully good!  I doubled the recipe and covered a pizza stone to the edges with the dough and cut with a pizza cutter in a grid.  It came out perfect and made plenty for 2 adults and 4 kiddos.  Thanks "Cookin4my3boys", this one's a keeper!

I can't find my own favorite recipe then found and tried this one!  So light and fluffy; easy to make.  I kneaded the dough right in the bowl.  I was concerned because I my baking soda and baking powder were old but still, these biscuits rose right up in spite of that, and were the perfect shade of brown.  I would highly recommend this recipe. I plan to pass it on to my daughters immediately!!!!

I tried this recipe because it called for butter rather than shortening. I am trying to avoid "partially hydrogenated" anything and this fit the bill. These biscuits truly are delicious and very light. The dough was a bit too sticky so I sprinkled flour on it generously before kneading and it didn't seem to impact the final product. We enjoyed them with some sausage gravy. Mmm, mmm, good!

These were a wonderful hit with the family.  I will probably make a triple recipe for family gatherings, instead of making the usual biscuits or rolls, because these are so different and tasty.

Great flavor and so easy to make.  My husband thought they were a little too dense.  But if you are looking for a tasty biscuit, this is your recipe!
