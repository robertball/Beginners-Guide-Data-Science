A bit sweet but nice texture.  This recipe did not fill the deep dish pie crust, but who cares.

This was delicious. Made some subs: used sweetened coconut flakes (it was all I had at the time) and 1/2 cup of sugar rather than full amount. It was plenty sweet enough.  Also added some dried berries.

This is the exact pie my mama cooked for Christmas dinner every year for about a billion years.  For a coconut-pecan junkie like myself, this is absolute pie heaven!  Addressing the "sweetness factor"... yep, this is one hellafied sweet pie and it's supposed to be lol  A little advice: we once tried doubling the recipe to make two pies and it was so over sweet it was scary.  Better to make one at a time.  And enjoy!

I only had med eggs so added an extra and used unsweetened coconut but it is VERY sweet.
this set up beautifully with the extra egg. We stirred the coconut in and then arranged the nuts on top (3 small to med girls helping with the baking this year)
This will be a family keeper for sure! 
going to try adding figs or dates to it next time for a slightly different flavor.
