This recipe is pretty good but it isn't truly authentic. Try using broccoli Rabe for s little bitterness that's nice.

My grandmother along with my mother and I have made this  stew style  soup  for many years. it is from Spain  and not Cuba.  Of course  is made  there along with  all other Spanish  speaking  countries  as it is a Spaniard recipe. we use Kale  and no Turnips.  but every  family  is different.  we also make it with chicken to get fresh chicken stock along with bacon

Very similar to one I ate in Spain. 
Added paprika and black pepper.
Will save and make again.

Everyone loved it!!! I used more turnips and greens than it says and changed the sausage, only cause that's what I had on hand. This is now one of our favorites!

We made this to use up some turnip greens we had. The changes we made were that we added a couple more potatoes because although we had turnip greens, we didn't have any turnips on hand. We also added bit of chopped bell pepper and just a handful of shredded carrots we had leftover from other recipes. Other than that, we followed the recipe and the family said it was delicious.

This was amazing. I used ham hocks instead of sliced ham. Very very good.

Not sure where "this dish from Cuba" came from as the name states it's from Galicia Spain and it's like their version of a cassoulette. It is delicious on a cold winter night!

Make sure you use Spanish Chorizo and NOT Mexican chorizo and the original recipe calls for smoked ham hocks and Spanish Chorizo not ham and polish sausage.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't find turnip greens at the market and I substituted kale.

We just came back from Spain and it will now be my version for my friends here at home.

Loved this but thought it didn’t need all the meats or garlic.
