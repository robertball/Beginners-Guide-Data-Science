This was an excellent meal. It was very easy for me- and, seeing as i'm only 14, this means very easy. I used all turkey and instant mashed potatoes, and it still came out perfect. The instant potatoes really saved a lot of time and trouble without sacrificing taste. It was a little underseasoned, so i would suggest that you do what i did- add garlic powder. Along with the other veggies, i added a small can of sliced mushrooms, which i love and added some nice texture. I took the advice of other people who reviewed the recipe and put in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. It really was delicious, and i will definitely make this over and over again.

I made quite a few changes, and this turned out amazing! It was so simple. I added garlic, worchester, cayenne, paprika, seasoning salt, etc. I also used a can of mushrooms and 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies. I added a few tablespoons of parsley to the mashed potatoes for some extra colour. Can't wait to make this again, Thanks!

Very good...but I did make a few changes. I use just ground beef (1 lb or so)...no ground turkey and season the beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, 2 cups beef broth, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, and I also add 1/2 cup frozen corn, . I followed the directions to cook as they say.

What isn't there to like about this recipe.
It's simple and easy and tastes great.
It's a great one dish meal.
The beef broth adds a rich flavor to the dish.
I also found that you can add different vegetables to it like green beans and pearl onions.
All our friends who've tried this dish have asked for the recipe.
I recommend this recipe highly.

This was good, but only if you add more spices, as others suggested.  I added 1 Tbl. worchestershire sauce to the meat while cooking.  Later, I added 1/4 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. salt, and (scant) 1/4 tsp. pepper - perfect!  I used ground turkey, and lean ground pork that I had on hand, but next time, I think I will use all ground (lean) beef so that it's not so dry.  I left off the cheese, as the Shepherd's Pie I had in Ireland didn't have any - I think it's more authentic that way.  This recipe just needs a little tweaking here and there, but I will be making it again!

I loved the idea of this recipe, but made my own by altering a few things. I had leftover potatoes and carrots soaking in beef broth from the hideous diasater of a roast I made last week. The beef was too tough, so I gave it to the dogs and saved the rest.  I took the potatoes and mashed them for the topping.  The carrots were diced and used in the meat mixture.  I use 1/3 lb of 95% lean beef, 1/3 lb italian pork sausage, and 1/2 lb of ground turkey. I added garlic salt/pepper, black pepper, more garlic powder, worchester sauce, a small white onion, and some frozen peas. Heat that on the skillet (no oil b/c the beef and pork gives plenty of it).  I put it in a 375 preheated oven for 25 mins.  It was FABULOUS!

This was a really good meal and a fun one to do on a week night, though not the quickest of meals.  When I followed the recipe, I ended up with about a 2:1 ratio of potatoes to meat/veggie mixture.  Being that I am a huge fan of mashed potatoes, you might be surprised to know that I plan to reverse this ratio the next time I make this because the flavor of the meat/veggie mix was so good.  Having so many potatoes sort of dulled the impact of the spicy mix.

I made the but altered to my liking. I browned me with pepper, onion powder, and woreshire sauce. After draining meat from fat I then added campbells french onion soup. I strained the soup, added some cornstarch to broth, added to meat then added the onions from soup. Brought that to a bowl then simmered. My potaotes I made fresh but added whipping cream to potates. I used a 1/2 a package of mixed frozen peas and carrots. I layered, meat, vegetables, potatoes, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese to cover potatoes. Then sprinkled paprika and dried parsely on top. Back @ 350* for about 15mins. My two boys LOVED IT!

I added some butter and garlic powder to the potoates.  I used all ground beef and added some balsamic vinegar to the beef mixture as it seemed to be lacking in flavor.  I added a ton of spices to the meat mixture as well.  I used an entire can of broth as there wasn't a lot of liquid.  Used a mixture of frozen carrots, corn and beans.  Kids enjoyed it, hubby loved it.

I started making this almost 2 yrs ago, and my family LOVES it. My husband is my biggest critic of my food, and he eats this up every time I make it (there's really not many dishes I make that he DOESN'T like, lol). Only thing I did was seasoned the meat w/ some adobo, garlic powder..the first time I made it I noticed the meat was a little bland, so after that I started seasoning it before i added it to anything. This is the perfect recipe for Shepard's pie. Thanks for sharing it with us!

I chose to use all ground turkey instead of beef and it was delicious! Rated a 9 out of 10 by my husband and I'm sure we'll be enjoying this dish again in the future!

First let me tell you that I wouldn't make preheating the oven the first step in this recipe.  If you are having to make fresh mashed potatoes and then cooking the meat mixture you might as well wait a while before you turn it on.  I think this is a really good base recipe.  When I made the mashed potatoes I just whipped them with butter and milk (like I would normal mashed potatoes) I also added some Lawry's seasoning.  I did not use the olive oil at all because I thought that would make the dish too greasy with the hamburger fat and also because I sauteed the onion and carrots in butter by themselves then drained them really good then added them into the meat mixture.  Like many of the other reviewers I used 3 T. of the tomato paste.  Instead of adding the frozen peas I used 1/2 can of peas and also 1/2 can of corn.  I seasoned the mixture with salt, pepper & Mrs. Dash tableblend.  We really liked it and I plan on making it again!

I've made this several times and it's very tasty. I made the following changes: I use low-fat sour cream (about 2-3 tbl) and garlic salt when mashing my potatoes instead of oil. I added season salt instead of regular salt to the hamburger mixture, and omit the carrots and peas and just serve a veggie on the side. Also, I use all ground sirloin, which is 96% fat free (leaner than most ground turkey). I've been searching for a flavorful shepherd's pie recipe that doesn't rely on canned cream soups, which are high in fat, and this is it.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I changed a few things to simplify-just used turkey instead of any beef, and I used a 10 oz package of mixed vegetables to cheat on the carrots and peas! Also ran out of cornstarch but I used whole wheat flour and that more than did the trick! It makes tons for one person, I'll be eating this for days!

After reading the other reviews about this dish being bland, I added some garlic powder, paprika, and worchestershire sauce to the ground beef, but still found the recipe to be bland.  It definitely was not tasty enough to justify the prep time and I won't be making it again.

This is the first recipe I've ever given 5 stars to on this site!  This is a great dish.  I made only one change, and that was out of desperation- I realized halfway through that I had no cornstarch, so I used flour to thicken instead.  Worked great.  Hubby loved it- will definitely make it again!

This was good, but it definitely needed more flavor. I added two cloves of minced garlic with the onions and added cheddar cheese into the meat mixture before topping with the potatoes. I had leftover mashed potatoes, so I warmed them up and whipped them with a little whole milk for the topping.

The oil in the potatoes ruined the taste of them.  The whole recipe really didn't have any flavor.  Sorry, but we really didn't like it at all.

Way good, I used 1/2 cup beef stock and 1/2 cup Bells Expedition Stout with a tad more than a splah of whorchester sauce instead of beef broth, much tastier.  Try adding some garlic powder or replacing the turkey with ground lamd, less healthy but more wholesome.

I used 1 lb. ground turkey and no beef. Also was out of tomato paste so I used about 5 Tb. of tomato sauce instead. It still turned out wonderfully.

I made this last night, and I agree with those that say add extra seasoning. It was good, but it needed a bit of oomph. I also used carrots and squash instead of peas, and buffalo instead of ground turkey. And yes, add more tomato paste. I'll definitely make it again - it was quite good!

easy, delicious recipe that totally hit the spot! I made some changes:
-added a can of corn
-omitted beef broth and instead prepared the meat using HOT taco mixture to give it a little kick. 
Enjoy! :)

This recipe turned out very good for me. After reading the ratings I knew to season it well. I used ground turkey and some mild sausage which tasted great and I cooked the onions with the meat to add more flavor. I also used some seasoned salt and pepper to add some flavor ( not too much). I added a 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and it was just enough. Last I put a generous amount of cheddar cheese on the potatoes. My husband loved it !

A good, simple recipe. I added mushrooms, green and red peppers and extra carrots to make it a bit more substantial. I also used more beef broth and added oregano and parsley for a bit more flavour. Instead of using the mashed potatoes here I used my favourite recipe from deliaonline.com which is healthier and uses quark cheese (my favourite soft cheese). Overall a good comfort food recipe which can adapt to whatever additions you decide to put in.

This was ok for a lower fat dish.  I used venison for the meat and corn instead of peas.

It was okay, we liked it.  I used only beef, so technically it's a "Cottage Pie".  I used Instant Mashed Potatoes and added Worcestershire Sauce to the meat. Used a frozen peas and carrot mix, sauteed briefly with the meat.  I would make it again.

I make this whenever friends are coming home from hospital, or otherwise not able to cook, served in a foil baking dish along with a salad and maybe buns.  Freezes well.  I usually double it and make with extra lean beef burger.   Always appreciated as an easy meal.  I usually make it as listed as it is a standard fare that is goes over well with the picky eater or those with  diet restrictions.  I don

I thought this recipe was easy, I didn't add any supplemental spices to the meat mixture, but I did season the mashed potatoes with salt and garlic powder. I have to stay dairy free, so when there's no cheese on top, you have to have some flavor in your tators. I also substituted the fat free milk with original flavor Almond Milk and left out the beef, just used 1 lb of turkey. Thought it was delish. :)

With many of the suggested changes, this comes out well.  My advice to people reading the reviews regarding how many potatoes to use:  If you use four medium potatoes, the recipe is fine.  I cut back based on many of the reviews and had skimpy potatoes.  Four large baking potatoes and you'd have a lot!  So four regular medium sized potatoes, and it's good!

As soon as I popped this in the oven I realized I had forgotten a very key ingredient... the beef broth. I was scared this would be horrible, but even without the broth it was quite tasty. I used a can of diced carrots, frozen peas, and canned mushrooms. I'll be sure to add the broth next time I make this :)

This is really good. I make it on a semi-regualr basis, because i know i can ALWAYS depend on it. I use instant mashed potatoes to save time, and all ground turkey because that's what i have. I also add a can of mushrooms to it, and 2 more tbs of tomato paste. Yummy.

This recipe was okay but not extrodinary.  It was a little bland. I used a bag of mixed frozen vegtables instead of just carrots and peas and eliminated the butter in the mashed potatoes to cut down on the fat.  I will probaly make this agian but perhaps I'll add a little more meat and alot of pepper.

Very good! I used all turkey.  I think it definitely  needs to have some ground beef in it, maybe all ground beef. I used frozen mixed vegetables and instant mashed potatoes to save time and trouble. I also think a little more tomato paste would improve it.

Yummy!  I didn't have ground turkey, so I used 3/4 pound of leanest ground beef (less than 10% fat).  I also didn't have carrots, so I added thawed frozen green beans to the peas.  My tomato paste was flavored with pesto, and I used about 3 Tbsp. - it had a great flavor.  I also added garlic powder.  I used about 1-1/4 cups of beef broth.  It was, in every regard, a very tasty and very simple dish.  I will definitely make this one again!

It seemed like I was just eating mashed potatoes..
the ratio seemed to be off.
