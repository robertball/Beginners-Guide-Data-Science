An interesting and different salad which presents beautifully.  Flavors blend nicely. Definitely could use some "heat".  Two suggestions: err on the side of too little rather than too much corn bread (not all muffins are created equal) and after the presentation, I would toss the salad prior to serving.

This is the best! Easy to prepare. I purchased the pre-cooked, sliced, fajita style chicken in the regrigerated meat section. I've made it serveral times and I get rave reviews and lots of people wanting the recipe. Great do-ahead. Taste even better the next day.

This recipe was ok. Interesting and the layers done in a trifle bowl looked quite pretty. Overall just did not care for the texture of the cornbread with the salad ingredients. I think a nice taco salad with a slice of cornbread on the side would give the same desired effect.
