Oh my... we really loved these pizzas!! We ate chicken fajitas for dinner last night, so we ended up with some leftover chicken and peppers.
Made my own pizza crusts, so I grilled mine a little bit longer.... the crusts were crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside mmmmmm delicious!!!

Since I'm unable to bbq where I live, I had to modify the recipe a tad. I cooked the chicken and pob peppers on my Foreman grill, and left the onions raw. For the crust I used a boxed Jiffy pizza base mix, to which I added a handful of chopped fresh cilantro that I'd mixed in a little olive oil. The pizza was good but I wish I'd marinated the chicken in something - lime juice/ fajita seasoning/ Chipotle powder woukld have been good. With a few more adjustments, this could be outstanding. Thanks!

I did all the grilling for this recipe on my George Foreman grill (the ones that close like a panini press) and it came out excellent. I marinated my chicken in some herbs and spices before grilling and instead of placing the topped pizza back on the grill I put it in a 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes. I also didn't have any pre-baked pizza crusts so I used the Grilled Pizza recipe (also found on this site) It came out fantastic! I loved the taste and flavours - this was very enjoyable. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This was sooo good. just made it for the first time tonight.Would suggest loading on the peppers and onions, and add red peppers to the mix and about 2 tablespoons of Cookies seasoning.  AWESOME.

Loved the pizza. Maybe next time we'll try queso instead of pizza sauce to give it a more fajita like taste.
