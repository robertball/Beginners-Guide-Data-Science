I thought this recipe was really simple with good flavor. I stopped my slow cooker at 3 1/2 hours, but when making this again I think I would try 3 hours. Some of the smaller apples were very soft. Large apples are key to this recipe.

This smelled delicious, but when I checked them at 2 1/2 hours, they were burning. Maybe my apples were a bit on the smaller side of large or maybe they weren't very juicy. Even so, I think 4 hours on high is too much time. I enjoyed the raisin and apple combo.
