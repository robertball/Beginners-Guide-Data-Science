This recipe was delicious. I made it for a family thing hoping to have some leftovers but the family devoured it ALL. I used 8 eggs instead of 6 and added a little extra bacon and used sharp cheddar and pepperjack cheeses. It was so great. Will definitely make again.

Loved it, but changed it a little bit. Used red and green peppers, swapped bacon for ham and omitted the cottage cheese and added 1/3 c cup half and half to eggs. Sauted meat and vegetables, than stirred in potatoes and cheese topped with egg and baked. All done in my trusty cast iron pan.

It disappeared from the casserole dish right after everyone got home!!  However, it was A LOT of work lol!!  seriously! It would help to do as much prep work as possible before you actually go to assemble the casserole.  Thaw the hashbrowns in the fridge, grate the cheese, chop the green peppers, dice the bacon put the eggs on the counter to warm them to room temp etc.  But everyone liked it a lot!  I would probably add a couple more eggs to keep it moist, it was sort of dry (we don't use too much cheese and I used only two cups of cheese).  It would probably be good to add Rotel Diced tomatoes at the end to top it.  I'd make it again maybe try sausage and more eggs :)

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was delicious.  I used 1.5 lbs of bacon instead of 1 lb and added one egg.  I also made a veggie version with no bacon and added spinach and red pepper.  Yum!

Loved it!  Made it today and it got rave reviews.  I will say that we cooked it for about 10-15 minutes more than stated because it didn't seem to be setting.  It was perfect and I will definitely be making this again.

This was a delicious breakfast casserole!  I pretty much went by the recipe except I used sausage in place of the bacon and also I normally don't have cottage cheese on hand, so I replaced it with a cream cheese/sour cream combo and will double this next time to make it creamier.  I also added in a dash of garlic powder and parsley.  It was super filling and made a great brunch!  Half the recipe made plenty for us with leftovers.  I made it all in my cast iron pan to eliminate an extra dish.  So yummy and will definitely have to make it again.  We garnished with sour cream and salsa.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very popular with our Christmas morning brunch bunch! We omitted the chilies, in deference to the tastes of some of our guests.  I doubled the amount of egg - I started with 6 and it was evident that there was not enough to cover the other ingredients and bake sufficiently.  As we already had purchased a large spiral-sliced ham, I substituted ham for bacon.  Added red bell pepper to the green for effect.

I skipped recipe cheese and added 8oz of shredded Colby jack.   Doesn't matter if hash browns are frozen either.  Also added 7 oz of free chiles.   This is awesome and will be in the book for a long time!!!!

I made with chopped ham instead of using bacon for a healthier alternative. This is a high protein dish totaling about 123 grams. Even the kids are it all.

I changed a few things; 7 eggs instead of 6 because I used 2 cans green chilies; I used medium cheddar and 3 cheese blend (no Swiss); I used a roll of lean ground sausage cooked before added and 4 slices cooked bacon crumbled.  Every adult that has tried it loved it but small kids just don't appreciate all of the different textures and colors so have something else available for them.  It is wonderful!

This dish mostly tasted like bacon and took 45 minutes to cook. Overall it was okay but not worth the effort.

this was really good!! I had to cook it longer but maybe just because I am at a higher altitude, about 30 minutes longer. Great recipes

I made this in a pressure cooker and it was good,  just needed a bit more moisture. Used the saute function to cook the bacon and onion first,  then added the rest of the ingredients. Will add 1/2 Cup milk next time.  15 minutes did the trick.

Awesome! I upsized by about a third and baked in disposable aluminum pan for a hungry crowd right before a winter morning snow shoeing expedition in the Rocky Mountains. I did need to bake longer to account for added volume. Everyone loved it!  My 22 year old son is asking for recipe after taking leftovers home to share with room mate. This is definitely a keeper I’ll make again and again.

I started a review but it posted before I finished. I made this for a group the day after Thanksgiving. The only thing I changed was to not use bacon grease but butter to prepare the pan. I also drained the bacon and veggies after cooking.  The dish literally was completely clean within moments. People said it was the best breakfast casserole they’ve ever had. Next time I’ll add pickled jalapeños for a kick. We like spice. Try it!!

I used medium cheddar, monterrey jack, sausage, red and orange bell peppers instead of green. Absolutely used the whole can of green chilies. Those were the only substitutions I made. I loved the way the cottage cheese worked in this dish.

Great breakfast casserole (even better than ‘Christmas Breakfast’. Followed the tip and used eight eggs and a teaspoon of black pepper. Fluffy, eggy, deliciousness! Made in two, 8x8 pans for more edges! Bacon and cheese quiche without the crust. Make one ‘all the way’ and the second for your, beloved picky eater!!

I made this with ham as I had it on hand. I sautéed the ham and onion in bacon grease I had in the fridge and also used that to grease my casserole dish. In addition to green bell pepper, I added red. The cheddar I used was very sharp. Turned out delicious!!!  I did need to cook it a little longer though, about an hour total. Will definitely make again.

Yum!  I made this for a MOPS breakfast, and everyone seemed to like it!  I used potatoes o'brien to save myself the step of cutting up peppers and onions.  I also used sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  I followed the rest of the recipe, and it turned out great!  I baked it for about 40 minutes, and I think the potatoes could have been cooked just a few more minutes, but it was very yummy!  Will definitely make again!

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast and was so disappointed.  I thought that the ingredients seemed a little funky even though I love everything that went into this dish.  It WAS funky.  It just didn't taste good, and I made it exactly as written.  Won't make again and in fact, will be throwing it in the garbage.  A waste of expensive ingredients.

Followed recipe, no changes. I think the prep time is understated, I felt it took awhile to put together. Cooking bacon, shredding cheese etc. Not sure I would make again. It was good but I have other breakfast casseroles that  i think are better.

Perfect recipe as written.  As per other advice, make sure you defrost your hash browns first.  My hubbie likes it in a wrap with hot sauce.

I have made this several times.  Its great for a group, it seems to feed a lot and fill everyone up.  To make it easier I used frozen potatoes o'brien, it already has the peppers and onions and saves you time and tastes just as good.  I don't use the chilis either, but I keep the recipe the same.  Always a hit and taste delicious!

This was really good.  I made half the recipe and substituted bulk sausage for the bacon.  I plan to bring a couple of slices to work everyday.  It is soooo good.

A satisfying meal with all the best breakfast goodies in one dish. Would be great with sausage too.

This was delicious!  The only change I made is that I used egg whites and the only further change I would make next time is double the bacon or add another meat.

I made this delicious recipe for a brunch.  The first time I tried it, I realized I should have baked the potato crust longer before adding the filling.  

My 2nd time around, I followed the instructions more carefully by spraying the shredded potatoes with cooking spray.  I also baked it longer.  The problem I had both times was with the edges burning a little even when I added foil.
However, the darker edge didn't seem to affect the taste.

I served it with a dab of sour cream and bottled salsa.  This has turned out to be my favorite quiche.  I didn't add bacon because bacon is too expensive in Israel but when I return to the States I will.  It was really delicious and I had rave reviews.  This recipe IS a keeper! 

One more thing . . the first time I used canned evaporated milk instead of cream of half/half and it tasted great.  The 2nd time around I used half/half and I couldn't tell the difference.

When I made this I figured I'd have leftovers for the next day. Not the case though! My guys & their friends enjoyed it a lot! They ate it all! I'm making it again soon because they keep looking for it in the fridge...as if there WERE leftovers. Very easy to put together & I can see how variations can be made easily if need be.

I added 3 Tlb of sour cream instead of the cottage cheese, added some left over sweet sausage. it did take about 10/12 min longer to set up. Was delish!    Will make it again.
