Not bad, next time I would add more chocolate to get better coverage. Probably 1 cup of chips to every 2 cups pecans.

I used roasted almonds and mixed milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I agree with SLJOHNS suggestion for the proportion of nuts to chocolate chips. These hardened very nicely in the refrigerator in about 15 minutes. I like the idea of ganache covered nuts; even though delicious they are a little messy on your fingers!

I'm glad I only made enough of these to decorate some cupcakes! They're beautiful, delicious and an ideal garnish but this is not for the impatient or for those that don't like gooky fingers.  These would be perfect and unique for fancy, plated desserts!

Tasted great but never hardened completely....we had to keep them in the fridge and they were always soft.

Not as easy as it sounds. I had to add more cream that the recipe called for to help coat the pecans. Very messy also but delicious treat.

Very good! I used about 1 1/4 cup almonds to 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Yum!

These are yummy, but really messy to make.  I also thought the chocolate was not hard enough.  I've made them twice, though, and they are a big hit!

Two stars for the basic idea.  The pecans will not be sticky if the chocolate chips are increased to  one and one-half cups, and the cream is eliminated and replaced with one ounce of shaved paraffin melted along with the chips.  The pecans will not be sticky and any left over chocolate mixture can be frozen for future use.

These are good but the chocolate never hardened even in the refrigerator. They were too sticky to put in a treat bag/box and give as a gift.

Just tried this.  The chocolate would not stick to the pecans. Won't try this again/
