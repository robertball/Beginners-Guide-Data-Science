I use this recipe but I use mixed berries instead of blackberries and I don't roll it out, I layer it in the pan with dough, berries, dough and it cuts the prep time in half and it's absolutely fabulous.

This is sooooo good. My hubby loves it hot from the oven with vanilla ice cream too. I also (after reading another review) just put half the dough in with the butter, sprinkled it with a little cinnamon/sugar mixture, put the berries in and then the rest of the dough and a little more cinnamon/sugar and covered it all with the sugar syrup. It was very quick and came out great with a crisp top. These types of recipes are why I keep coming back to allrecipes.com. Thank you for sharing.

I have grown blackberries all of my life, and Grandma and I used to cook blackberry cobbler routinely.  This is the best recipe I have ever tasted.  I substituted 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream instead of milk - but it's great either way!

This is the ultimate blackberry recipe.  I used fresh berries that were a bit tart and it was still came out wonderful.  My family of five ate the entire dish in one meal.  I love blackberries so I would probably add 1/2-1 cup more of the blackberries.  I also like mine a bit more moist so I would add more of the sugar mixture.  I forgot to sprinkle the cinnamon on the top of the blackberries so I just added it to the syrup mixture.  Great recipe

This was amazing.  You can definitely get by with only half the butter.  I think next time I'm also going to try a half Splenda/half sugar mixture to make it a little bit healthier.  I've been dreaming for the first homegrown blackberries of the season for months so I could try this.  It was SO worth the wait.  I couldn't find my rolling pin, so I just placed bits of dough around and then dumped the berries in.  It took a lot less time and worked perfectly.

YUMMY!  I made this tonight for my husband and used frozen berries.  I didn't let them thaw and I think that made it more difficult to roll and cut, but it still turned out awesome!  Thanks for the great recipes, we will definately be making this again!

Excellent and super easy to make. I just make layers instead of rolling the dough and it comes out yummy topped with some homemade whip cream.

I thought this recipe was just okay. It came out very "cakey" with very little liquid. If you prefer a chewy/crispy crust this is not it.  Maybe if you don't use self rising flour that would help.  Also, I thought it needed a touch of vanilla extract. Hubby said it was good.

Finally the hubby that thinks that everything is 'ok' rated it a 6!  I did use 1/2 the butter and 1/4c less sugar than called for (and I hate it when people alter a recipe and then rate it) but I know what my family likes  (less fat, less sweet) - this was absolutely awesome.  I made fresh whipped cream and served right out of the oven.  This was a great comfort food desert on the snowiest day of the year. And, for those that had a problem cutting and transporting the cobbler to a dish - I cut it in the dish to cut down on the mess!

This is one of those recipes you can take to a potluck. It attracts attention on the table among all the other desserts, and it tastes as good as it looks, thus pretty much guaranteeing you'll have none left to take home.  I have tried it layered as well as rolled up and sliced, and it comes out equally well. The rolled pieces are prettier for presentation, in my opinion. For those who need speedy preparation though, this may not be your cobbler.  "It takes a little doing," as my grandmother used to say!

Great recipe and super simple if you follow the advice of others and layer half the dough in the bottom of the dish, sprinkle with cinnamon, spread the blackberries, cover with the remaining dough and then pour the water/sugar mixture over that. I increased the blackberries in mine and it was delicious but I did have to place a cookie sheet underneath to catch the boil-over juices. I also used margarine instead of butter and it was great. Yummy!! Thanks for sharing!

I used more sugar and added some light brown sugar since I have a ridiculous sweet tooth. :-) Didn't have any self-rising flour so I added baking powder and a pinch of baking soda. The results were FANTASTIC! This is the easiest to make and remember cobbler I have ever made. I will definitely make again.

Went to an orchard yesterday and picked a ton of blackberries, so naturally turned to allrecipes for something to use them in - thought this was decent.  not the best cobbler i have had, but it did look pretty cool with the jelly roll thing, once it baked it puffed up in all the right places.  i heard the sugar/water thing is authentic for cobbler, but it did seem a bit moist, even though the dough did absorb alot of the water.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good solid base for me. But I felt a crumb topping was necessary, so I added (approx) 1/3 C brown sugar, 3 tb flour, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Mix well and cut 2 tb butter into the mixture. Add this as a substitution for the 2 tb sugar in the last 15 minutes of baking. I will follow previous recommendations of adding vanilla to the recipe. Also, I like things on the sweeter end, so I will probably add 1 1/2 C sugar instead of 1 C to the sugar/water mixture that is poured on top. It might have been my blackberries, but it was pretty tart; especially if you put ice cream on top.

Oh boy, this was a great way of using up some freshly picked wild black berries.  But...I did make a mess of this.  I forgot to flour the surface when I was rolling out the dough.  So when it came time to roll the dough up with the berries in it, it stuck to the surface.  I finally just picked up the dough and berries and slamed them in the pan and baked.  Turned out good.

This recipe is AMAZING!  We spent the day prior picking blackberries and since we picked more than I knew what to do with, I replaced the water that the recipe calls for with blackberry juice. It was easy; I just mashed up about two cups in a pot on the stove and smashed them through a sieve (the pulp made great fruit leather!). Using the blackberry juice made it easy to cut the sugar to just under a 1/4 cup. Like some of the other reviewers, I rolled out the dough and put it in the pan then layered the berries followed by a second layer of dough on top. I also replaced 3/4 cup of regular flour with whole-wheat flour. This recipe lends itself to adjustments and still tastes incredible. Just in case you want to go "old school" style, this cobbler turns out awesome if it is baked in a deep cast iron skillet. Great if you’re trying to increase your iron intake!  Thanks for sharing your Grandma's cobbler. We love it!!

When it comes to baking I am totally inept.  In fact, almost all of my failed domestic episodes involved attempts at baked goods, but I am so glad I took a stab at this one.  Well it didn't look pretty when I threw it in the pan but it turned out awesome.  This recipe is a must try and one of my new favorites!  The first time I made it with a mix of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  I just made it for the second time with sliced and peeled peaches and it is also delicious!  The peaches were a little tart but the sugar water helped balance the tartness. You have to try this recipe, you won't regret it!

This is by far the best cobbler I have ever made.  It sounded like it was going to be difficult - but it really wasn't.  In fact, I was able to put it together in our camper.  This is most definitely a 'do-again'!!!

Excellent cobbler!  I had 3 different kinds of berries in my freezer that I was trying to figure out how to use and this was it.  Absolutely delicious!  I can see using many different types of fruit for this cobbler.  I was a little put off when I read the recipe and saw that I had to roll out a dough but it was very easy dough to work with and I was done in a jif. I followed the recipe as is (except for using different berries) and thought it was perfect.  Can't wait to try apples.  Hopefully, someday (when I have some!), my own grandchildren will remember "MY" cobbler.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome, but I only give it 4 stars because I think it could be done a lot simpler without the jelly rolling. The crust is perfect and flakes and crunches like a cobbler should. We prefer to eat it warm with vanilla ice cream.

LOVED IT!!!
Before you put it in the oven, it looks like a big soupy mess but don't let that scare you! It turns out wonderful.
Also, rolling it up and cutting is a little difficult so I will just drop it in with berries next time.  Also plan on doubling the berries because that's my favorite part.
This will be the recipe I use from now on

I am definitely new to the cooking business. I am a newlywed who hasn't had much experience in the kitchen, but when I made this cobbler for our Memorial Day cookout, my dad thought it was my great-grandmother's recipe. He swore up and down that it was her cobbler. When I told him I took it off of the internet, he was surprised. Everybody dipped in on it, and to my surprise, was completely gone in less than 20 minutes. I plan on making this same cobbler to take to my grandma, whom I am certain will love every bit of it! Excellent recipe!

This recipe was PERFECT!  It was much easier than I originally thought it would be.  Like other reviewers, I chose to skip rolling the dough out and just scattered small pinches of the dough in the pan.  I put about half in the bottom, then sprinkled the berries, and topped with the rest of the dough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.   We ate it warm, topped with vanilla ice cream.  My boyfriend and I thought it was one of the best desserts we've ever eaten!!!  It definitely filled the memories I had of my Granny's blackberry cobbler growing up...which was exactly what I was looking for.

This is very, very good!  I used more blackberries than the recipe calls for, and I didn't roll and slice.  I just rolled out the dough, poured the blackberries on top, wrapped the dough around the blackberries and plopped everything in my dish.  It worked!  The cobbler was super-juicy and delicious!

I made this today with wild blackberries.  I increased the sugar & water by 1/4 cup and the berries by 1 cup.  After mixing the flour, I divided it in half, taking 1/2 and patting it into a circle the size of the bottom of the baking dish.  I then covered it with the berries, sprinkled the cinnamon over them and put pieces of the remaining dough on top of them.  Then I poured the sugar syrup over it all, and baked as directed.  It was absolutely delicious with vanilla ice cream!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you, Trudy!

The liquid level in this dish must really have to do with your blackberries -- I see some reviews say theirs came out dry, but mine was a little on the wet side.    I thought this was really, really good.  I think the extra effort of the simple syrup and rolling the dough and berries up really makes a difference.  My only small complaint is that even with the syrup, the biscuit dough still tasted mostly like a regular baking powder biscuit.

I have made at least 10 cobblers with this recipe - all different sizes and even one where I forgot to add baking powder/salt with the all purpose flour. Every one has been great! I even made a peach one, slicing my fresh peaches thin then coating with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little sugar. Also substituted some brown sugar for the white in the syrup mixture and poured some caramel ice cream topping on top instead of sugar for the last 15 minutes of baking. It was wonderful as well! The crust is what makes it so good and we wouldn't do it any other way besides rolling it up (even though it isn't easy with our HUGE berries!).  We like crust in every bite.  Oh yeah, in an attempt to make it "healthier" I use 1/2 white, 1/2 whole wheat flour. Of course then my DH pours half and half over his dish - so much for healthy! :-)

Let me say this is one of the BEST RECIPES I have used on allrecipes! I did not realize I would be making the recipe into a roll until I was half way thru the recipe. I hesitated but decided to stay true to the recipe. I am soooo... glad I did. The dish was beautiful and flavorful. This is not your momma's cobbler! I took this to a large potluck and it was a huge hit.

This was the best AND most beautiful looking blackberry cobbler ever.  I loved the "jelly roll" process- it was unique and a lot of  fun to make.  The only discrepancy I had was that the dough was quite wet- I had to add more flour to reduce stick for kneading and roll out.  Bake time was perfect.  Don't skip the sugar sprinking 15 minutes prior to finish.

I had fresh blackberries on hand from Farmers Market and had all the ingredients asked for so gave this recipe a try.   It was very easy to prepare.  I gasped a bit when I added the simple syrup as it seemed like way too much, but it baked up perfectly.  Another reviewer mentioned problems with the crust, but our crust had great texture and the fruit wasn't too sweet.  We will be making this again.

I have never given a review on a recipe, but this one was just so great...hats off to the creator of this recipe.  I was very skeptical at first, it just did not look very good going into the oven but omg..it is the bomb.  I did as others and just put small chunks of the dough mixture and then berries and more dough mixture.  It looked beautiful coming out of the oven.

The first time I made this, I didn't have either the self-rising flour or baking powder. So I improvised by using a package of biscuit mix. It turned out great for being in a pinch. Everyone loved it!

This cobbler had a superb flavor and consistency. My only negative comment is that it is nearly impossible to cut into 1/4" slices as directed. How can you roll out the dough, spread large berries over that, roll up and then slice 1/4". The berries I had were very large (quarter-size) and while attempting to slice the rolled log the berries would drop out. I ended up cutting them about 3/4" then gently placing them into the melted butter pan. As I said, this tasted very very good, just that it was not as easily done as other reviews said it was. I followed directions to the "tee".

Yes, this was the best!! I did not roll out the dough but instead dropped it in the pan in little bits, layer of berries, more dough, berries, finished it with dough. After baking 45 minutes, Tbl sugar and cinnamon mix on top and finished baking. Was worried it would be too sweet so only used 3/4 c sugar-water and it turned out WONDERFUL!!!!

Simple to prepare and a lot of fun rolling. I would imagine kids would love making this Blackberry Cobbler and on the plus side, its not very messy :D

Its sweet and the outcome is amazing with such little effort to bake.

For presentation, I suggest putting it inside of a 9in instead of a 10in. As you run out of room in the pan, squeeze the rolls tightly together and and push the extra rolls between; they don't have to stay in circles. As it bakes, it comes out beautiful. 

Side note: I used non-frozen blackberries and the *flour from the recipe (flour, salt, baking soda).

Loved this recipe.  I was skeptical about the amound of liquid (sugar-water & melted butter) but it came out great.  Took a little longer to set (1 hr) but was delicious!  I made a couple minor tweaks: I used baking mix instead of flour, and I mixed berries with about 1/3 cup of Danon lite & fit vanilla yogurt before spreading over dough.  Last, I sprinkled top with some left over crumb-topping I had from another recipe.  FABULOUS!  I will definitely make this one again!

My friend made this recipe and it was TOTALLY AWESOME!  Absolutely the best cobbler I've every had.  The only thing that she did different was use 4 cups of blackberries and increase the water and sugar to 1.5 cups each.  FABULOUS!!!! I can't wait to try it myself.

For my dad's Father's Day meal, his desert choice was Blackberry Cobbler. I have NEVER in my life made cobbler but I was ready for the challenge. This recipe was awesome! We ate it about 30 minutes after it came out of the oven so it was warm. We topped it with vanilla ice cream (Blue Bell) and it was DELICIOUS! I used frozen blackberries that I let thaw in the bag on my counter for a few hours. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

I have made this recipe so many times I have lost count. Always a hit. The first time I knew this was going to be a hit was when I took it to a family reunion potluck. I made enough that it fit inside a large aluminum rotisserie pan. I left with only a small bowl full which didn't even make it home. NOT DIABETIC FRIENDLY! Well worth the time making it. I have mixed it up on subsequent batches with the berries and here in Oregon we have a Northwest mixture of marionberries, huckleberries and blue berries in the store. That combination is a hit too. Don't be afraid to venture out. This base is perfect!!!

The oddness of this recipe is what attracted me to it, but half way in I was regretting wasting my blackberries on an experiment.  My blackberries were straight off the bush and very juicy.  When I rolled and cut it looked like a murder had taken place in my kitchen - then I poured the sugar syrup on top and it looked way too soupy to work... Silly me! I should have trusted the recipe without worry- not only does the soupy mess turn into a beautiful cobbler, it is the best I've ever tasted!  Called our 4th of July host and put my dibs in on bringing the cobbler - no doubt it will be a big hit anywhere! YUMMY!

Yum! Thanks for sharing your cobbler recipe. Although a little different from a traditional cobbler, it is definately better in my opinion. I made it with a mixed berry (raspberries, blackberries and blueberries) Cant wait to try it with apple. This is definately a keeper!

So good! I used different combinations of fruit and it all worked well. I found that the amount of dough isn't quite enough - I would suggest doubling the recipe, and just layering fruit and then dough (instead of rolling them up).

My wife made this cobbler for me after an afternoon of Blackberry picking.  I was amazed at the recipe and the quality of the cobbler.  This is by far the best cobbler that I have ever eaten.  I believe that this recipe will be used by my family for many generations to come.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly ingredients wise. I then did the same as another suggestion and used half the dough and placed in the butter on the bottom of the pan. Sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mix and covered with the berries. I then put the remaining dough slices on top and sprinkled again with cinnamon and sugar. FANTASTIC!!!!

I was a little nervous after reading the ingredients that the crust or cobbler part would come out soggy but I was totally wrong! This is the best blackberry cobbler recipe I've found yet! I changed a few things like adding some baking powder,salt and mixed blackberries with blueberries. Its the perfect mixture of crunch with plenty of berry juice/gravy at the bottom for your vanilla ice cream. Will be making again!

I have never made anything like this before, so when I started rolling it up, I thought I'd messed up - the berries started falling out, etc... but when you bake it up, it doesn't even matter any more, and everyone loved it! I made it for my parents and they couldn't get enough.  My mom was very impressed. :)

I, like most other reviews i read, had trouble with rolling the dough...it was dry and fell apart when i tried to roll the berries up in it. I did use 3 cups of berries instead of 2 and it seemed to be the perfect amount for the flavor...it is overall a good recipe. It is more of a biscuit dough than a cake like dough.

This needs a lot more berry in it, its too bready as written. Also, I don't melt a 1/2 cup of butter in the pan. I just butter the bottom and use half the butter called for.

This is really great.  I did a few things differently.  I used the flour mixture in the notes, and instead of cinnamon, I used a sweet cinnamon sprinkle that I had instead.  It was really good, everyone loved it, and it was very homemade.  I didn't know whether or not it was going to turn out because of the way it looked right after pouring the sugar in it, but I baked it and all was well.  I did bake at 425 for 30 minutes, and then added the sugar, and baked at 375 for 15 minutes, only because I was making other items, but it worked.  Next time, I'll add different berries to the mixture though.  I enjoyed the blackberries, but think this recipe would be great with some other berries added into it.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used a strawberry/peach combo.  My dough fell apart when I tried to roll it so I just kinda squished it together and then sliced it--doesn't seem to matter anyway.  I was very skeptical after pouring the sugar water over, it looked a waterlogged mess, but it turned out wonderfully, and the water really does get completely absorbed!  This is my first time making cobbler like this, and I'm very happy with it.  I'll be making this again for sure.

OH MY! This was amazing! I don't know how anyone could write a bad review for this. Because of the reviews that stated that this was too sweet, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup to 1 cup water and we thought it was just right. Also I only sprinkled about 2 tsp. of sugar on top after baking 45 minutes. After sprinkling the top with sugar I baked for another 10 minutes rather than 15. I did not have self rising flour so I followed the instructions given for that. And I confess I did use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. The dough was exceptional. Crunchy on the top and extremely moist underneath. Wow! NOT dry at all! I can't wait to make this again. Thanks of the recipe.

I tried this lastnight using fresh blackberries and I really didn't care for this recipe.  I thought with all the good reviews that this would be "the" one that I've been looking for but unfortunately it wasn't.  The dough was very good but the sauce was not what I was expecting.  I'll keep looking for a blackberry cobbler recipe.

Excellent idea.  And the proportiona/measurements were spot on.  My only concern is the jelly roll style.  Everything kept falling out.  Hey, it's cobbler, you can't really mess it up.  But the presentation would have been prettier if the filling would stay in.  Any suggestions?

Our family and friends loved this cobbler. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Actually, 3 out of 4 of the adults(myself included) didn't even like blackberries, but couldn't get enough.  My husband (the only blackberry fan and a pretty accomplished chef) actually made it, and he said he was unable to cut it into 1/4" slices.  He said they were 1/2 to 3/4", and it turned out wonderful. He also said he didn't use the entire 2 Tbsp of sugar on top and there was more than enough. This was a great recipe that we will definatley be making again. Thanks, Trudy!

My grandma has since passed and wow this reminds me of her.  I put the cobbler in a bowl while warm and add milk, sounds weird but just try it.  It is just fabulous!!!!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I have made this several times and it's been perfect every time!! I do reduce the butter in the baking dish to 1/4 Cup just to make myself feel better! the one thing I don't do is roll it, I have attempted to roll it twice and it's just a disaster. Not pretty, but doesn't effect the tast one bit!! I've "dropped" the dough in randomly, which works just fine. But I just made this again and I took the advice of others and rolled the crust into 2 seperate sheets and layered it like a pie. Crust, berries, crust-- this will be my new method perfect bite each time!

Taste gooood.  I don't like seeds in my cobbler, so I cooked down the blackberries and strained the juice.  I didn't use the cast iron either.  Itried to drop the dough in my regular saucepan to then later transfer to casserole dish.  Quickly decided to go ahead and pour the liquid in the casserole and then drop the dough into it.  Also, I used a little of the berry juice with water in the dough so it has some berry taste and a purple color.

I have never rated a recipe before - but this one absolutely deserves a five star rating! I have made many cobblers, but this recipe wins hands down! I do not care for cobblers with a 'biscuit' type dough. This is a wonderful pastry dough - if you want a nice amount of crisp, rich, buttery pastry with each serving - this is THE recipe!

This is absolutely delicious. And it is so pretty. It would a perfect "something" to take to an ill friend or neighbor or anyone! Perfect if you have blackberries in your backyard...everything else is usually in your cupboards! Excellent!

This blackberry cobbler tasted great! I would, however, use less sugar syrup and melted butter because it came out a little soupy...I used frozen blackberries and put it in a pie plate...

I just made this tonight and it was wonderful! I prepared exactly as wriiten except for 3 minor things. I just sprinkled the cinnamon without measuring and then brushed the dough with some of the melted butter, I though that would help the dough adhear during the rolling process. Also I was concerned about the tartness of my berries so as not to change the recipe I just let the cobbler set after I poured the sugar water for about 30 minutes. I baked for about 1hour because it seemed a little sloshy at 45 min. The berries were a great texture and the crust crispy on the top and still flack in the center. Also I a so glad that I read a review that said it looked like a big mess when it went into the oven... or elso I would have thought I messed it up. I cannot wait to try with other fruits.

Fantastic!  I'd never made a cobbler before, but this turned out GREAT.  As someone mentioned below, it is a BIG mess when you cut up the roll, but well worth it for the delicious flavour.  I used three cups of berries and added on a delicious crumb topping 15 minutes into baking.  The crumb topping is 1&1/2 cups of flour, 1 cup of brown sugar and 2/3rds cup of butter or margarine.  Mash it up with your fingers until it makes a lovely crumb and sprinkle on top!  I also didn't bake it as long (only 45 minutes) and it turned out great!  Thank you!

THis is my go to cobbler for events. I use about a cup more berries than it asks for only because you can never have too many! This is a great cobbler for people who don't love cobbler because the crust is sweet and amazing and the entire dish is great right out of the over. My husband loves blackberry season even though I have done it with peaches,  apples, and raspberries...all good but not as great as the blackberries

i didn't have time to roll out the dough so   i just kind of put it on top. And it turned out the same, but it just wasn't for me. Its tart and crunchy. If thats your pleasure then bake away, but if not i would advise you to find a different recipe

This recipe was awesome!  It tasted just like my grandmother's cobbler.  I read some other reviews that mentioned adding more of the water/sugar mixture, so I used 1 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I also used 3 cups of blackberries instead of two.  It was fabulous!!!!

This recipe tastes great. My only gripe is that it is really hard to roll it up like described. It is much easier just to randomly drop the dough in. It looks similiar and tastes the same. I've used this to make blueberry cobbler too.

For those who think this sounds difficult, it is not.  I mixed the pastry in the food processor and then placed parchment on a 18 X 13 baking sheet and rolled the dough out on this, I was able to use the parchment to help roll it, it cut easily with a serrated knife. It turned out Beautiful and Tasty.  The only change I made to the recipe was I omitted cinnamon (personal preference).

This recipe is awesome as is, and even better modified; I substituted 3/4 cup raw sugar, whole wheat flour, and a mixture of blackberries and strawberries for my filling.  I skipped the sprinkled sugar on top but served the cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  Perfect!

Just made this cobbler for the first time.  It is absolutely my new favorite recipe.  The combination of the tart blackberries (I used fresh) and the buttery crust is perfect.  The flavor reminds me of shortbread but the texture is light and soft on the inside and delicately crisp on top. I will be making this often.  Hope it is as good with other fruit as it is with wild blackberries.

This recipe is awesome! I just made it today and followed the original recipe word for word. It turned out perfectly! I used semi-frozen blackberries I had in the freezer from my husband's aunt's garden. I let them thaw on the counter for about an hour before making the cobbler. My husband and I just had a serving each with ice cream and he said it was one of my best desserts ever. Thanks for the great recipe! I will be using it again.

4 stars because it came out a little dry.  I'd skip the "roll" part next time and just layer the ingredients as others have done, and I'd add more of the water sugar mixture.  I like a moister cobbler.  One more thing I'd also use unsalted butter.

This was one of the best cobblers I have ever had.  However, it is very difficult to jelly roll the berries in the dough as the directions state.  The berries kept escaping, so i placed the berries one side of the rolled out dough and then folded the un-berried dough over the berries, which made a pocket.  This prevented the berries from getting away when I jelly rolled them.  When I sliced the roll it was still a little hard to keep the berries in but using the knife to block one side of the slice and my hand to block the other it was successful.   We have also tried this with Blueberries and it was great but a little on the sugary side.  I can't wait to try with another fruit.

Awesome!!!  My husband was telling everyone that walked into our house to try it.  The nice thing was our daughter who is allergic to eggs and nuts was able to eat it!  Substituting things for eggs is always nice but things taste so much better if they don't call for a modification in the first place.  Thank you!

Besides adding an extra cup of berries, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I found it to be too doughy.  My son ate it all - thus the four stars.  I might try this putting the crust on the bottom and the top.

This is a special treat.  The biscuit portion reminds me of a shortbread cookie.  I made the dough in the food processor and rolled it out as instructed. Mine was done and getting brown after only 50 min.  I added the extra cinnamon/sugar and baked another 7. It turned out perfectly. 
  I used frozen mixed berries that were heavy on blackberries.  I ended up with a lot of extra juice in the bag so while the cobbler baked I sweetened the juice and thickened it with a little cornstarch. Then I served it warm along with the cobbler and whipped cream.

My Family and I cook desert together every Wednesday and decided to do something different since we have blackberries that grow all over the place here in our yard. This recipe was simple and easy to follow.  We did add sugar to the cinnamon and a touch of vanilla in the dough to give it an "umpf" to it. Everyone enjoyed and it lasted all of 5 seconds.

All I can say is that this is quite possibly the best cobbler I've ever had and my family will agree. Followed the recipe as is and I found by keeping to the original the presentation was much prettier and unique looking. Great recipe!

My cobbler turned out a bit different b/c I didn't have the exact right sized pan but it ended up looking like cobbler rolls and everyone commented on the appearance. It was a hit with the sweet-lovers in the family. :)

Delicious!  I wasn't sure I was making it right at first, it looked watery as I put it in the over, but it came out fantastic!  This will be made again very soon!

Excellent easy recipe!  Made a wonderful dish.  The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I added more berries.  When I rolled out the dough I just put a solid layer of berries on top before rolling it up.  After I cut the slices (which are not much of a slice) and put them in the pan, I added the syrup and then a couple more handfuls f berries.  I would suggest that when you wash the berries that you lay them on paper towls to get the excess moisture before putting them in your dish so there will not be excess liquid in your cobbler. All in all, a very reliable recipe that I will definatly use again!

I didn't have the self rising flour so I used the baking powder and salt combination.  I followed the directions exactly.  When I was cutting it to put it in the baking pan, it fell apart some but I just layed it in the pan and it was fine.  Looks more complicated than it actaully is.  This is a keeper in my box!

this is an excellent and accessible recipe for even novice bakers (such as myself) - after procrastinating for several hours in fear of the baking process - i undertook the task and was overjoyed at the ease of the preparation and even more so with the outcome - the dough was almost like a pie pastry and VERY tasty - i added some cream cheese to the sugar water mixture and then dolloped additional cream cheese on top before baking - that added a special dimension in gastronomic delight

It is in the oven as I type--the recipe ingredients sound great--and most of it is simple but the rolling and cutting---it is so messy, I sure hope it comes out tasting good---This is the first time I am making this---but from right now--I would not make this recipe again. I have made alot of cobblers many different ways but never this way. I so wish there were more pics with most of these recipes.  I shall report back after tasting it--tomorrow:/

This desert was made with triple berries and was gone in a matter of minutes, since I served this at a holiday party. I did manage to sneak a bite and it was wonderful! Very messy to roll out as the recipe instructs - next time I will just roll out the dough and tear chunks as suggested by other reviewers.

This cobbler was absolutely wonderful! I had never made a cobbler and really wanted to impress my boyfriend's family for the fourth of july and boy was it a hit. My future father in law raved and raved about the cobbler. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so simple and turned out perfectly. I cannot wait to use this recipe again! I will keep this recipe forever! Thanks for posting.

This recipe came out great. I served it for a Labor Day get together and the whole thing was gone in about 1/2 hour. I made the recipe exactly according to the directions. I may have had slightly over 2 cups of blackberries because I used a bag of frozen and didn't want any left over. Very tasty!

My first attempt came out too sweet, so I cut the sugar back to 3/4 as suggested by other reviews. It came out great. My friends loved it too and are asking for the recipe, always a good sign! I used 1c fresh raspberries and 1c fresh blackberries. Delicious! It looks gorgeous!

Yep, this was a GREAT recipe... and I've eaten many blackberry cobblers in my day.  I will admit, I forgot to modify my flour to "self rising" but realized it too late and it still came out great.  I will try sub'ing canned biscuit dough next time to save on prep time.

Okay, so I have to say that this recipe is delicious! However, I think we could use some hints and tips on how to successfully "Jelly Roll" The thing to prepare for slicing. I personally rolled the dough out onto a sheet of wax paper so that as I was rolling it the wax paper supported the dough. Also, if you have huge blackberries like I did, I find it best to mash them a little bit so they stay in place and don't destroy the crust. Otherwise, this recipe is top notch in my book.

Yum, yum, yum!!  I have never made a cobbler before, and I had some blackberries that I needed to use up.  I am thrilled with how this turned out!  I found it a bit challenging to roll the dough - mine was a bit dry (as others have said), so it crumbled when I tried to make my jelly roll, and when I tried to slice it.  But I managed to get it all in the pan and into the over.  The end result is beautiful!!  I even threw in a few leftover blueberries that  had in the fridge.  I can't wait to serve it to my husband tonight for dessert!

Delicious, and so simple! I was also skeptical about the sugar syrup, but it works beautifully and the cobbler came out lovely and moist. I have found that turbinado sugar on top gives a nice crunch. I served it with warm custard sauce, and got rave reviews.

I liked it. Easy and delicious.  I didn't roll it out.  I took half the dough and squished it flat on the butter in the pie pan. Then I covered it with fresh pitted cherries.  I also put cherries around the edges. I poured half the sugar water on it. Then cover with the other half and the rest of sugar water. EASY!

We've made this a bunch and have started to experiment a little.  Last night i added 2 tsp lemon zest to the dough, then 2 parts blueberries (frozen) and 1 part cream cheese instead of the blackberries.  Also I mixed the dough entirely in my food processor, way easier!  I had rave reviews at the neighbors with this version.  Thank you to Trudy for sharing a very different way of making cobbler!

I love sweet and buttery more than most people, but this was way too much for me!  The melted sugar just formed a thick layer in the bottom of the pan so I could remove a lot of it, but I really thought I would be a much bigger fan.

We absolutely LOVED this cobbler! We used fresh blackberries and it was wonderful. The only thing I changed (and that was due to time) was tearing off pieces of dough and flattening it out by hand and layering it throughout the cobbler. This one is definitely a keeper!

This came out wonderfully and was much easier than I expected.  Pretty and delicious.  It was certainly sweet enough, I might even use less sugar next time.  I'm definately going to try it in the future with some different fruit.  I used the flour, baking powder, and salt instead of self rising flour.

I don't give 5 stars unless it's really incredible, and this recipe is TO DIE FOR! This was moderately easy and delicious. The flavor of the crust is absolutely fantastic, which is to be expected seeing as though you start by adding an entire stick of melted butter at the bottom of the pan ;) If you're watching your weight...steer clear of this dish, but if you need a crowd pleaser, go for it!   This dish would also be incredible if you substituted apples, peaches or cherries. The tartness of the cherries against the savory crust would be sublime.   Enjoy ~

I thought the cobbler wasn't as sweet as I expected, and I didn't care for the blobs of dough because they didn't cook all the way through, and were quite flavorless.  If I make it again, I'll increase the sugar a bit in the cobbler, use smaller spoonfuls of dough to cover the top, and top with some turbinado sugar and cinnamon.

This is the best cobbler I have ever had. My husband is not a blackberry fan but he loved this dish.

I cut the pieces almost 1" thick and then only used one stick of butter in the pan and topped it with only 2/3 cup of sugar water. It was rich, tasty and probably a little healthier than the original recipe.

We plan to make this again tonight with blueberries instead and again next week for company after we have picked more blackberries.

This is a delicious recipe! I tweeked the recipe a little by using 3 (5.6oz) containers of fresh blackberries. The melted butter and sugary syrup seem like a lot of liquid but it will be absorbed. This is so good this is my second time making it within 2 weeks!

Absolutely the best cobbler recipe I have ever eaten! I though the amount of liquid would be too much, but it turned out perfect, twice! I used fresh berries. I think if you used frozen ones, you might need to decrease the liquid a little. It was a hit with my family. I can't wait to try it out with other types of fruit.

I have never made a cobbler before and this recipe looked too easy to be good, but it is.  I used fresh blackberries that I bought at the store but ended up being too tart to eat alone.  Rather than trash them I thought I'd make something with them.  I put this into a Longaberger pie plate which was filled to the brim.  I put it on a cookie sheet assuming it would boil over, but it didnt.  It baked for the full time and came out great.  Just sweet enough, but not overly sweet.  I'm eating it hot out of the pan - I wish I had vanilla icecream - that would go great with it.  Will certainly make this again.  One tip I would give is to roll out the dough thin - its a bit tricky to work with once the berries are in it and its rolled up - but it makes for less dough in each bite.

YUMMY! I made this last year for the 4th of july and 2 pans were gone in less than an hour! I did take the note on switching out milk for heavy whipping cream, which was great, and then also I substituted half the white sugar with brown. I added 2 tsp of vanilla and used  1/3 water 2/3 berry juice for the boiled mixture....SO good!

This is by far the best recipe for cobbler I have ever tried.  My husband has always said his mother makes the best but he now tells me that he prefers mine.  I sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on the top when I bake it as well to give it a little bit of a crust.  Outstanding!

My husband went crazy for this cobbler. This is a fabulous recipe - with a few minor changes. I used half and half instead of the milk and like previous reviews, I did not roll the dough.  I layed down half the dough, sprinkled cinnamon sugar, then berries then the rest of the dough and more cinnamon sugar. I served it warm with Bluebell Vanilla Icecream..yum!!!  I will definitely be making this again soon.

It tastes  like a blackberry cobbler, which is what I wanted, and its yummy (I like the cinnamon addition). However..making this....was a disaster! One of the most complicated recipes I've tried in a while.  Rolling the blackberries up was very difficult. The dough was sticky and not easy to work with. The sugar water seemed like it was going to be a complete disaster. I read this recipe over and over again before trying it. I read the reviews and liked how it was rated for the most part. However, it was not as easy as it could have been . I may make it again, but with substitutions to make it easier. Lets just say the whole process made me frustrated.

I followed this recipe word for word and was not impressed at all. Way to much sugar and way to much butter was used in this recipe. I used fresh blackberries from our garden which made it semi- edible, but I just can't get past how overly sweet this is- and I like sweet things. If I make this again I would cut the sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 cup and the butter from 1 cup to 1/2 cup as well. Along with being overly sweet it is overly buttery as well. I do have to say it baked up perfectly just like the pictures. Also, I don't think it needed the cinnamon. Oh well.

This was a good a recipe however I let mines be on the wet side a little bit. I used this recipe for thanksgiving.I used All Purpose flour because I did not had any self rising at that time neither did I used baking soda or salt. I know I did rolled out the dough a bit too thin so what I did was I made some biscuits and dropped it in. instead of fresh or frozen berries I used can blackberries instead. I felt that milk amount wasnt enough so I had to use a little more. and I felt that the sugar amount wasnt enough of either. I would rate this three stars but I'll give it 4 instead.

This was my first cobbler ever and it turned out picture perfect! My fresh berries from my yard were quite tart but other than that it was really good. I did roll it up as suggested; it was easier than expected & made it very attractive. I will be trying this same recipe with peaches tonight. Wish me luck. I will let you know how it turns out. :>)

This was the first time I ever made cobbler and it was PERFECT! I involved my two kids and it was fun, easy and the reward was well worth it. We had just been berry picking and had a lot of blueberries (some that were not yet ripe) and this cobbler turned out fabulous as blueberry cobbler. Crunchy, yummy, perfect!

I wanted something different to make with our abundant wild blackberries. This sounded simple and had great reviews. I doubled the recipe. I didn't stray too much off the recipe. I cut 1" thick instead of 1/4" and only poured the sugar water to the top of the dough. It was good but hoping it was sweeter. It was runny when I tried it hot and didn't care for it that much. But after letting it cool, the sauce began to gel and it was much better. You have to have vanilla ice cream with this to off set the slight tartness. The next time I make this, I will sprinkle sugar on the blackberries and place foil under the pan (it splatters).

I'm lazy so I didn't do it jelly roll style but and I forgot the cinnamon ( I just sprinkled it with the sugar the last 15 minutes) I just cut rounds of the dough and did one layer over the melted butter, then dumped in the blackberries and then the rest of the dough on top and then I poured most of the sugar/water syrup around the dough and baked..It was soooo good and I'll make it again. Blackberry cobbler is my favorite dessert ever

Great Recipe!! It took me a while to pick, but I'm glad I picked this recipe. I did spread cream cheese on the crust before adding the blackberries and I used a little less water(it just looked like too much) but it turned out awesome!! The kids and adults alike loved it, espescially with vanilla ice cream.

This is the only way I make blackberry cobbler now. My only modifications are to sprinkle the cobbler dough with cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg before rolling and increasing the amount of blackberries slightly.  This is a delicious and beautiful looking cobbler!

This is soooo wonderful!!  It was like going back in time and eating my great-grandmothers cobbler!  I used Splenda in lieu of sugar and it was wonderful!!!  The crust was great!  I cant say enough good about this recipe.  I divided the dough in half and layered it (it looked like a pie) like others had suggested.  My husband ate half of it in one night!!  I served it with vanilla icecream and it was ........ oooo la la yummy!  Thanks for this trip down memory lane via my tastebuds!

i was nervous about making this because it was a total experiment.  it came out good - my husband loved it as well as my 2 year-old (she only got a little bit).  i agree that it is cakier than the traditional cobblers i've tasted, and it was a bit sweet (i used a mix of blueberries, unsweetened strawberries, and sweetened berry mix).  the rolling was a bit difficult, but i worked it out anyway.  overall, good and tasty, but i might try a different recipe next time.  thanks!

My grandmother used to make a cobbler similar to this one. I tried to make one like hers ever since she passed away. I tried this one and it was so close to hers. The only change I made was the crust because I like a thinner more crunchy crust. I used the non-rising crust I use in my peach cobbler, it also holds together better when you roll it up. Thank you for this recipe it was fantastic.

This was a big hit!  We had never made cobbler before and ended up tripling this recipe for a large dinner party.  Because of the volume, we opted not to follow the instructions about rolling and cutting, etc.  Melted the butter, added the fruit, dropped large balls of dough into the fruit, and then poured sugar water over the top.  Also, we used fresh peaches, granny smith apples, a pear, and frozen blackberries.  Delicious!

Oh wow - I've never made a cobbler before but my husband had been begging for cobbler for weeks. Blackberries came fresh from the backyard and I followed the recipe EXACTLY. Made it three times now and everyone that has had it wants to switch to this recipe. Thanks for sharing your family legacy and making a legacy for others!!!

I was a little worried when my dough came out a tad bit too dry. It was pretty hard to roll out without falling apart, but boy what a great result I got after baking. It tasted phenomenal. The dough tasted like a biscuit and the dish like a blackberry shortcake. My boyfriends hates sweets and he ended up having 3 servings in one sitting. I thought it was one of my best dishes. What a wonderful recipe!

Mine turned out great. Topped it with a little brown sugar ice cream and it was heaven. I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used the all purpose flour, salt, and baking powder and my crust turned out crisp.  I also did the layering thing to cut the prep time. Unfortunately, my neighborhood grocery store didn't have any fresh blackberries so I used two bags of the frozen blackberries and it worked out fine.

This is the best cobbler recipe I have ever used.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was great couldn't ask for better.  The next time I made it I used strawberries instead of blackberries and my boyfriend couldn't stop saying how good it was.  If your looking for a great family pleasing cobbler you have got to try this one.  I can't wait to get some peaches or apples to try it with them.

Best EVER!!!  I followed other suggestions and just placed some dough in butter at the bottom and the rest on top.  I thought that suggestion was a little strange, but it seemed easier than rolling it up...I personally would have made a real mess.  But, by placing dough on the bottom and top, it turned out fabulous and very easy.

Delicious! I picked some blackberries which were growing wild and was looking for a simple recipe to use them in. This was perfect as I had all the remaining ingredients already in my larder. I cut my rolled slices slightly thicker - approx. 1 cm - because it was difficult to cut them so thin, but the end result was fine. I also didn't need the full hour's baking time - 45 mins was sufficient, and I think it would have burned if left for much longer. (I use a gas oven so that might explain the timing difference.)

Super super yummy!  I couldn't roll it very well so I either rolled the dough out too thin or put in too much blackberries (I guesstimated) so as I tried to roll it the middle kept opening up but I just cut that up and put it in the pan and it turned out fantastic anyway.  Not like cobbler has an aesthetic appeal anyway!  Friends and family loved it!

This was fantastic!  I used the regular flour directions and it turned out great!  I had to keep adding a little milk at a time to get the dough moist enough, but that was my only problem.  Very simple recipe and delicious outcome.  My guests said it was the best they had ever had!

Wow, was this good! We didn't change a thing and LOVED it! Thanks for a delicious recipe. It came out of the oven around lunchtime today and of about 5 minutes ago is completely gone...and there's only 2 of us in the house. Thanks!

I used ollalaberries from a U-pick ranch - ollalaberries are similar to blackberries but more tart. I did not roll up the dough either, as others suggested. I used a little less butter in the pie pan - and used an 8 in. pan. The sugar syrup made a huge mess in my oven but it got taken care of with the self-cleaner. It seemed almost more like a pie than a cobbler, but either way it tasted the same! When I took it out of the oven, I was pretty impressed with myself! I have a 2nd one in the oven now for 4th of July. I forgot to add the milk to the dough, but I think it will be okay.

The first time I made this, I really struggled with getting the pieces into the pan without spilling the contents. Since then, I've mashed the batter into little patties and placed them on top of the berries and it has been just as delicious and much less messy. For a twist, I've served it with fresh whipped cream with a little Myer's Dark Rum mixed in. Thank you so much for sharing this!

I thought this was a great recipe!  I used sliced peaches, nectarines and blueberries.  I used splenda instead of sugar and only 3/4 of the butter. I was too lazy to roll anything out and just layered dough and fruit.  I poured the sugar water mixture over the whole thing and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.  There was too much liquid after the initial 15 min, so I ended up lowering the hear to 350 and cooking for an extra 15-20 minutes...it turned out AWESOME!!!

Made this today for a Valentine's treat! It was absolutely delicious! One of the best blackberry desserts I've ever had. The reviews had me a little intimidated about the rolling part, but I had no problems at all. Turned out perfect. My mother fancies herself a blackberry expert, and I will definately be making this for her! Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made a lot of cobblers, but this was definitely  one of the best.  The crust is very crispy.  No other sugar needs to be added.  The water and sugar make are the perfect sweetness and consistancy.

This was my first attempt at any cobbler and it was AMAZING!  My husband and I spontaneously came across a patch of blackberries on a hike and when I got home I looked up this recipe.  We served it to several of our friends the next day and they all agreed it was the best cobbler they've ever had.  I didn't alter a thing...it is perfect just this way.  The only thing I would suggest is to be careful when cutting the rolled-up dough.  The berries fall out, but it still works when everything is placed in the dish on the butter.

Fantastic recipe and a delight warm or chilled.  Vanilla ice cream on tope makes it even better.  I didn't use all the syrup, as the pan could not hold it. I doubled up the recipe and froze the 2nd, uncooked, covered with tin foil and placed in a vacuumed sealed freezer Ziploc bag.    My husband said to put "LOTS of crumble" on top. He didn't know the recipe didn't call for it, so I obliqued his craving with a quick recipe of oatmeal crumble on the top. He LOVED it.

Amazing!  My family loved it!  One tip: If using frozen blackberries, let them thaw first.  The hard, frozen berries made it really hard to roll the dough.  I am adding this to my list of all time favorites!

This was really good.  I layered it like others have suggested and it came out with a very crisp upper crust that was just yummy.  I'm not sure why, but I had liquid on the bottom after the baking time. I just kind of spooned the extra water/sauce over the cobbler and the vanilla ice cream I served it with.  I will definately try again and hope that the extra liquid at the bottom resolves.  Great recipe and it is a nice change from the cakey type of cobblers.

I had picked twice as many blackberries so I doubled the recipe and tried to follow the suggestion of one reviewer to just layer it but that reviewer left some key details out. I had what I KNEW had to be too much butter and sugar syrup so I just brushed some butter on the bottom, then added the first layer of dough and scooped the berrys out on top. I ladled just a bit of the simple syrup over them then added the second layer of dough. It was an abyssmal mess! The dough was soggy (as to be expected). It has to be my error looking for a shortcut because other reviewers said it worked. I was just trying to work w/n the confines of my tiny counterless kitchen. The berries were salvagable. We scooped them out and ate them over ice cream and tossed the crust.

I don't cook, but I attempted to make this blackberry cobbler. It was so delicious! I couldn't believe I made something this wonderful. I'm making it for the second time now to suprise my husband. I DID need to add a little more milk than the 1/3 suggestion. It seems dry with the Self-Rising flour.

Very easy to make.  I used frozen peaches, strawberries and blackberries and it worked out great.  Very tasty - thanks!

Don't be tempted to change the recipe too much the first time you make it. It's so good just like it is. You won't be able to get all the berries to stay in the rolled up dough, but just put the extras in the pan and set the sliced rolls on top. I slice the rolled up dough with berries into 9 slices. One in the middle and the others arranged in a circle around it. It's beautiful. I cant' wait to have grandkids and take them blackberry picking! Then we'll come home and make this cobbler.

I made this for my uncle, so I didn't get to try to myself. My aunt said he ate half of it in one night.. sounds like a 5 star recipe to me!

I made an account just to say this is *THE* best recipe I have ever had. I am allergic to cinnamon so I kept that out and it was still fantastic! I can't wait to use this as a base for other cobblers! This put any other cobbler I have ever had at a restaurant or made by someone else to shame.

This is the recipe I always use for blackberry cobbler. Pouring over the sugar syrup is the key to a good cobbler.  Like another reviewer, I don't bother rolling it out, but that's partly because I substitute 3-4 teaspoons of canola oil for the butter to cut down on the fat content. It works fine; just use enough oil to form dry crumbs, then proceed as written. But the dough does come out soft and sticky enough that it's too much trouble to try to roll it out. So I don't. The cobbler comes out fantastic anyway. For special occasions I use butter and roll it out for a prettier dish.

Blackberry cobbler is my husbands favorite so I tried this for him. It came out pretty good but he said it was just too bready so the next time I made it I used 1/3 less breading and about that much more blackberry and I used a mix of canned blackberry and fresh blackberry. He absolutely loved it.

Awesome recipe, makes an delicious dessert with impressive presentation out of an old fashioned classic! We rolled it as well, and although it was a little messy, it worked out well. we also made this with half blackberries and half blueberries, picked fresh from our back yard. I found it to be the perfect sweetness.

We made this cobbler on our family vacation when it was my families turn to cook.  We were just looking to use up some blackberries from the garden that were end of the season and not as good.  It was a huge hit, everyone wanted the recipee.  Our rolls weren't beautiful but it tasted great!!!  Even with frozen end of the season berries.  We will make it again.  We followed the directions exactly except we made it in a rounded retangular corningware dish because that is what was at the cabin.

Smelled so good in the oven I could hardly wait to eat it. My husband said it was a treat and I can't believe I got him to eat fruit. He's not especially fond of blackberries. Share-able!

Really tasty. I thought it turned out great...although just a touch soggy. It got some good reviews from guests, although my husband thought it had too much of a butter flavor. I, personally, really enjoyed it and will make it again! Thank you.

I've made quite a few cobblers, but all of them were pretty much the same until I found this recipe!  This is just different enough to be special!  If your looking for a cobbler that will impress your significant other, this is the one.  Only thing I changed from the way it was written is the size of the cut, once you have rolled up the dough and berries.  Cut it around 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch and it works perfect and fits just right in the pan.   I can't imagine how you would cut it as thin as the recipes calls for or why you would want to.  Make it and enjoy with ice cream on top, wonderful!  Thanks Trudy!

Everyone loves this cobbler and I have even started making the dough for crust for pies because it is so easy and rolls out wonderfully.

Instructions were a little confusing to me at first, yet I was able to comprehend to the "roll-up" part.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and only sprinkled 1T on top for the last 15 minutes.  The overall flavor of this desert is wonderful.

I LOVE this recipe, the only thing I change is I add 2 more cups of berries, I use 2 cups blueberries & 2 cups blackberries or marionberries.    The cinnamon adds a wonderful touch of flavor without being strong and the sugar coating adds that crunchy top I love.  Will be trying with peaches next.

Very good flavor, especially while still warm. Biscuit portions get hard when cold. Jelly roll procedure a little difficult to manage, but do-able especially if slices are 1" wide.  1/4" wide slices will never work. Pouring sugar water into pan looks strange, but cobbler turns out great. 2nd time, I made recipe using fresh strawberries and added about 1/4 c. sugar to dough. This was very good.
