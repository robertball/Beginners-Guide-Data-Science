We use frozen meatballs and cook on high in the Crock-Pot for 2 hrs.  Excellent! :-)

I am the submitter of this recipe.  I'm not sure if I forgot to print it or if it was omitted - but I do use low-sodium products when making this recipe.  Hope this helps!

For the meatballs, I used day-old whole wheat bread and omitted the Maggi seasoning (only because I didn't have it). For the "gravy", I didn't have bouillion granules so I used Campbell's beef broth and I added a mess of fresh garlic as well as fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned and I sauteed them with the onions with a little butter before I added the gravy ingredients. The meatballs turned out tender and juicy, which we all agreed was very nice. I'm glad I omitted the Maggi seasoning because I think if I hadn't, this dish would have been way too salty. I think the addition of the full cup of cornstarch was overkill. Next time I make this, I'll cut it back to a tablespoon or so. The gravy was way too thick. Using condensed cream of mushroom soup is a great thickener, all that cornstarch is unnecessary. My husband and I also thought there was a little too much sour cream. I think cut it in half and it would be just right. I think using fresh ingredients and canned beef broth was a great step for this dish. Like I said, if I hadn't had to make a last minute substitution, it would have been WAY too salty. I'll make this again, with my changes. NOTE: I stand by my review only because I think had I not made the changes I did, it would not have been edible. You can sub low-sodium products when necessary but this recipe is full of them.

I halved the recipe and added 3 cloves of minced garlic. I also omitted the seasoning salt in the meatballs as recommended by many other reviews. I also used 6 oz of fresh sliced mushroom. While this recipe has the taste of a typical hamburger stroganoff, I found it didn't own the depth of flavors that my favorite stroganoff by Ken in CA created. That being said, it proves to be "kid friendly". I also didn't care for the onions and mushrooms texture since they weren't sauteed first. The onions were still a bit crunchy. Thanks for sharing.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought there was way too much sour cream in this sauce.  I won't make this again.

A bit on the salty side.  Will make again, but will probably use low sodium beef broth instead of the beef granules to see if it is any less salty.

Perfect, well the sauce is perfect for us (I used frozen meatballs).  This is just what I am looking for in a sauce.  I'll try the meatballs when life isn't so hectic.

I consider myself a very excellent cook and baker. It is one of my hobbies. BUT this was a complete disaster. My husband told me to throw away the recipe AND the leftovers.

Sauce was great as written but made my own version of the meatballs by adding onion and a splash of milk and 1 tbsp of egg replacer and leaving out the wheat based seasoning and worcestershire sauce.

At walnut size, I found these meatballs only needed 15-20 min of baking time!  Mine ended up sort of dried out.  I'd recommend the above time and then finish off cooking in the sauce.  I also sliced the onions and used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them before adding liquid mixture.  Overall, very good!

I thought these were really good. I was in a bit of a hurry to make dinner so I used frozen seasoned meatballs instead. I will definately make these again and make the meatballs. I didnt have beef bouillon so I used beef stock and the sauce was wonderful..not salty at all.

I absolutely love this recipe! I do make it a bit easier though by using golden mushroom soup and cream cheese for the sauce but other than that I make the meatballs as recipe calls for. Sometimes the sirloin steak in other stroganoff recipes is not as tender [even with marinating] as I like so the meatball recipe is perfect for fixing that problem. Thank you so much for this recipe...family absolutely loves it.

Too salty...really rich...2 cups sour cream!  Paired w/ egg noodles...which is what saved it.  Always use real mushrooms, they never disappoint.

I really like this way of making meatballs. I used some panko breadcrumbs instead of the bread and added lots of garlic to everything. I thought there might be too much liquid but it was just enough.

Used real Mushrooms.  Used Teryiaka sauce (had no MAGI) Used 5% sour cream as that was what we had.  Used Corning-ware dish (large ) everything fit.  I liked everything and served with red chili peppers and it was very nice ......good recipe!

Easy recipe. I did make a few changes. Added only half the bouillon, and I sautéed the onions w garlic before following the rest of the recipe.. I don't think I'm going to bake everything next time. To save dishes, I'm thinking I could put all the meatballs in my deep sauté pan and finishing cooking everything off that way.  Served over noodles.

Ok for a midweek meal but we didn't find it terribly exciting.  I made it for guests and we agreed that the meatballs were moist and tasty, but the mushroom sauce was somewhat same-y.

Awesome easy to make meatballs that my kids even loved.
