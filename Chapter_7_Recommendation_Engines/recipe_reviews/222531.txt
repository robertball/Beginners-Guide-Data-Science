This a was a simple and tasty recipe for hush puppies.  They were a big hit with my 7 year old!  The consistency was very nice - light and flaky on the inside.  I would like them to have more spice, and when I make them again I will add more seasoning to kick up the flavor a little.

I have made a recipe before for hush puppies and it didn't turn out, I looked for frozen this time around, but could not find any, so... I found this one, it already had great comments so we tried it tonight.  It was great, and not only did we love them, but were actually glad that we never found the frozen ones. Easy to make and delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

These were simple and delicious!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I added 1/2 tsp. Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning to the flour/Bisquick mixture.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are a great basic recipe for hush puppies. I added some OldBay for kick but the texture and recipe are otherwise spot on for what I was looking for.  Will keep around for next time I fry up some chicken.

Made these last night for supper and they came out great. I did add some chopped green onions for color instead of regular onions.

Very good.  I used some onion powder in lieu of the minced onion.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Everyone loved them.

I made this recipe exactly and the hushpuppies were awesome.  I didn't have enough oil to make balls so they turned out more of a patty but the taste was great.  I made about half by adding cajun seasoning and those were good too!  This is definatly going into the saved file and will make again!

I made this but it needed something wet to add all the ingredients together! Did anyone else find this to bee true?  I added water to it and it was pretty good with that a  little beer.

I haven't had a hush puppy in about 17 years and did this recipe gluten-free with gluten-free baking mix. And they are really really good!

Very good. I made it for my family and it was a hit. The recipe is very simple, but my family felt that the hush puppies needed some cheese or something else inside the ball

The texture of these  makes for the best hushpuppy I've ever had.  I agree with previous reviewers though that they are pretty bland as written, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  I added some canned green chilies and some Cajun seasoning and now they are spectacular.  I served them with Charleton Crab and Grits from this site and they were quite popular.

These were really good and fluffy. I will make again, but next time I will use less salt and maybe chop up some onion in addition to the minced onion. It just needed a bit more flavor. This recipe makes a lot so I would probably half the recipe. Not sure how that would affect the egg though.

The recipe title is fitting, as these were very simple to make.  I highly recommend using a deep fryer, unless you can regulate the heat on your stovetop to a consistent temperature.  I had to make these on the stovetop and my first batch was perfect, however, my oil got too hot for the next batch and the outsides burned before the inside was able to cook.  We thought the flavor and consistency of these was very good and I would easily make these again using a deep fryer.  Thanks for the recipe, myka!

Lacked any flavor what so ever other than salt. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one was the ease in preparation. I'll use the basic idea and add my own spin next time.
