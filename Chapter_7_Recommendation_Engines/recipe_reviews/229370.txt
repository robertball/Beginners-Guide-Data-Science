This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 dish as a "side", BUT if I would have known before hand how good this was going to be, I would have not cut it in half and I would have served it as the main course! I have seen similar recipes without the ham. I LOVE the addition of the ham! My daughter actually called me from school this morning asking me to heat some up and bring it to her at lunchtime. Unfortunately for her, she didn't know there weren't any left-overs. She has NEVER called me before requesting I bring her left-overs:) I will definitely be making again soon.

I used the same ingredients with the same measurements but I added 5 eggs and it was holy cow good! My family ate it all and begged for more.

This is a really nice recipe! No fussing with "cook this" and "chop that", just put it together and bake. It's a "scoop-out" casserole, not like lasagna that will neatly cut into squares. The dish tastes even better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.

I wasn't overly impressed.  I LOVE onion but this was way too much onion.  And the cream of chicken soup just didn't seem to "go" with it.  Next time I'm going to try doubling the sour cream and omitting the soup, only using half an onion and adding more cheese.

Add me to the list of people who think this is one of the best things I ever tasted.  And how simple!  I used ham which was already cubed so even that little chore was avoided.  We ate at least two thirds of this casserole for dinner and finished it off for lunch the next day....and my husband doesn't eat leftovers!  Very good, thanks so much, I have added it to my Christmas morning brunch menu.

I made a half batch of this for dinner last night and it was more than enough for my family. I have small children who are small eaters. I reduced the amount of onion by half and it was plenty, maybe even still too much. I also snuck in some steamed cauliflower, minced small, and no one noticed it was there. You could probably replace a quarter or more of the potatoes with cooked cauliflower because the color and texture are the same as the potatoes. I would be careful of the salt in this dish. I salted pretty heavily for the potatoes and had too much because of the salty ham.  The amount of butter seemed high so I used about half in the potatoes and saved some aside to toss with crushed corn flakes and some more cheese to make a crumbly topping. I still felt like it was a little oily. I think I will leave the butter out next time and see if I miss it. 

My family liked this pretty well and my picky 5 year old finished her plate, so that's good enough for me.

Update:  Made this again with no butter and no added salt and neither were missed.  It was better this time because I actually remembered to thaw the potatoes before mixing.  It was much easier to mix and the potatoes cooked through this time with no crunch.  Will ALWAYS replace some potato with cooked and chopped cauliflower, what an easy way to sneak in veggies!

This was prety good. It was really quick to put together which is nice. My hubby loved it and had 3rds but my kids wouldn't even try a bit because of the way it looked. I will make this again.

Wonderful, tasty recipe! I was looking for recipe for leftover ham, and one where I had all of the ingredients. This fit the bill and more. My husband, who normally doesn't like casseroles, and hardly comments on recipes said, "This is delicious!" after the first bite. I had to take the casserole away so he wouldn't eat more than a second helping! The chicken soup and sour cream make for a delicious creamy sauce. The only changes I made were to omit the butter and the added salt -- the dish doesn't need it -- and used low fat cheese and low fat sour cream. This decreased the amount of fat and cholesterol. I'll be making this again! Thank you mambear for submitting.

OMG this was so good. I was supposed to have had leftovers for lunches but my brother loved it so much he practically wolfed it all down. I'll admit minor changes. I didn't have sour cream and tried to go without but it was too dry. Only had the one can of the cream of chicken soup so I used a can of cheddar cheese soup. It was AMAZ! So Delicious and full of flavour. Oh I put in extra cheese of course too.

It was good. Two changes. I seasoned with some garlic powder and it did not need a 1/2 cup of butter. 1/4 would do

I made this last night and served it with tomato basil soup, it very well received. Changes that I made: I used Low-Fat Sour Cream, used 1/3 cup butter, used onion powder instead of onion.

Wow! This was amazing! I had to cut the recipe in half since there is only 2 of us. My husband says this is a keeper. Thank goodness because I love ham! I used a  diced pack of ham and Mexican blend cheese (bc I didn't have cheddar). The sour cream, the cream of chicken and the butter all came through. Be sure to take the tin foil off and let it brown for 20.

This was good.  I wouldn't call this recipe dry; though there wasn't anything to "bubble" when fully cooked as per the directions.  Next time--and there will be a next time--I might add some milk or another can of soup to make it a bit more creamy.

Great recipe.I got adventurous and substituted the sour cream for non-fat plain Greek yogurt for health reasons and increased the amount. In the interest of time, I substituted Onion soup mix and used cheddar cheese soup to male it even cheesier. So many possibilities with this recipe, thanks!

I made this recipe today, using sliced russet potatoes instead of the hash browns. I wanted something closer to scalloped potatoes, and of course it took longer to cook, but that was ok. It was tasty, and the right consistency. My only changes were that I used cream of celery soup and omitted the onion, as we cannot eat them. Very simple to put together and minimal ingredients!

I have made this recipe a few times now. Honestly, it does not  need the cube of butter. I dropped the butter, used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, used whatever cheese I had on hand.  All cheddar or a mix of pepper jack, cheddar and italian.  I have also cut up and cooked bacon until crisp and used it instead of ham. This is very versatile. If you drop the butter, add a little extra greek yogurt. Maybe 1/4 cup or so. My family loves this recipe. Great for breakfast or a side dish.

As written I would have to give this recipe 4 stars, there is just not enough flavor for us, but I can see it being very appealing to families with little ones! I omit the butter (both for health reasons and because it's a bit oily), shred 5-6 medium potatoes, sub cream of mushroom soup and use an extra sharp cheddar cheese, add a little bit of chipotle powder, diced dried garlic, and lots of freshly ground pepper. I cook it in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours or on high for about 4. Sometimes I add some frozen peas about 1/2 way through cooking just to get some more veggies in. It develops a nice crispy crust on the bottom and sides cooking it this way. Total prep time (including shredding the cheese and potatoes is still about 10 minutes). Overall a great adaptable recipe!!

I took it to my mother in law's house with pride only because most of the reviews said how delicious it was. I'm usually known for the one bringing the best dish.Way too many onions & it looked gross. Not one person said they liked it!! SOOOOO embarrassing!

Very good! Omit the salt and cut the butter and Onion in half. I also sauteed the onion before adding it to the casserole.

I love this recipe. Have made it several times, this last time I doubled the recipe and made two casseroles. Kept one in the freezer, after a few days I rehaeated the frozen casserole by baking in the oven for a little over an hour - just as good as it was fresh.

I've made this twice now, first time exactly as the recipe is written and it was delicious. I changed it up a bit to accommodate what was in my house this time and sliced up leftover baked sweet potatoes and used cream of celery soup. Really good, too!

I made this last night! Rave reviews from all my kids which is a feat! I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom. I used maple ham steak. I like that there's really no measuring involved, you just dump it all together! It was so creamy and delicious!! I'll definitely make this again and most likely often!

My daughters loves this. I live in a high altitude are. I would recommend cooking for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Taking foil off 30 minutes before done.

Delicious and hearty. I always follow the recipe the first time I make something. This is one for the books for sure. Next time I am reducing or omitting the butter and no salt.

This is a favorite in our house. I've also made it with smoked sausage instead of ham. I normally don't put onions in because my son doesn't like them but use onion powder instead. And most of the time I add frozen green beans. It is very rare if anything is left!!!

When I was putting this together my husband walked in and reminded me he didn't like this kind of stuff! He was wrong! He loved this! This was gone by the next day and he does not like leftovers either! Will make again. I did add extra cheese and celery.

Cut the recipe in half for our small family.  I think it turned out great!  UPDATE:  I made the full recipe and needed a HUGE popcorn bowl to mix it in.  Turned out yummy, although the chopped onions were still a bit crunchy.  I would suggest sauteing them first.

I think I was expecting this to be a true main dish casserole with the ham in it when I read it, but it is really a side dish and a different take on the hashbrown potato casserole side dish I already make. I doubled the cubed ham when I made it. If I made it again in the future, I would cut back on the butter, triple or quadruple the ham chunks, and put a crunchy topping on top of it. It is was very easy to make and you can walk away from the kitchen for an hour or so, which is nice. It would be a good side dish to bring to a family gathering or potluck dinner.

This is really good! I added some real bacon bits to it, next time I think I will try green onions on the top in addition. This would make a great breakfast casserole with a poached egg on top.

Yum Yum. I didn't have frozen hashbrowns so I shredded 5 medium potatoes. Also didn't want to heat up the oven so I cooked everything in an electric skillet. Oh my goodness it was heavenly.

I had used all the same ingredients with a few adjustments. I used half an onion and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I also added garlic powder.... didn't measure but I think it was about a teaspoon. It was wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.

Taste amazing, BUT holy cow that is a tone of butter! The entire bottomed of the pan is covered and it leaks out with every scoop! I would make it again, but I would cut the butter in half or maybe even down to a fourth! I was literally soaking it up with paper towels... I completely soaked 4 paper towels out of one corner and everytime I scoop there is an extreme amount of excess butter!

I thought it would be a bit bland for my husband and me. I added garlic and chipotle pepper and used leftover honey baked ham. I also used red potatoes with skin on. Will season even more on the future should we not be serving a crowd.

Easy to make! REAL EASY!  I think it needs a little texture... it’s reminds me of  “old” folks food- soft-  full of flavor, but I think it needs  something firm to chew on.

Only thing I do different is: use half onion, one clove of garlic & I sauté them in the butter then add it to the rest of the mixture. This cuts some of that sharp onion taste, in a pinch in

This recipe is very similar to one that I have been using for years to make cheesy potatoes in the crockpot.  One substitution I've made is to use 4 oz sour cream and 4 oz french onion dip and skip the chopped onions.  Adds a nice little zip

very tasty and fast to throw together! I used cream of celery soup (didn't have cream of chicken in my pantry). I really think the "cream soup" can be cooks choice of flavor.
I didn't add any additional salt.
 I might throw in some frozen peas or spinach for pop of color next time. 
I'm saving this recipe to my favorites! 
thanks for sharing !

I've made this several times usually omitting the soup or substituting a GF soup to make it gluten free. Either way it's super yummy!  Oh, and it's easy to make. What could be better?

Delicious!! A little sinful but sooooo good. Basically it's Funeral Potatoes with baked ham added. I didn't have an onion on hand so I used onion powder instead. Other than that change, I made the recipe exactly as written.

Pretty good, nothing special. Quick and easy. I used 1/2 cup diced onion but I diced them too big. They need to be very finely chopped or they will be too noticeable. I also omit the butter and didn’t miss it. Baked for 45 mins, then 25 min without the foil, but it never browned on top. 

TIP: For 30oz of hash browns, you need a BIG bowl. A regular 3 qt bowl will not suffice. I had to combine everything in an Instant Pot it was so much.

My family really loves this! I do this with 1.5 times the ingredients and double the ham for a family of five and usually have leftovers. Also I cook it for an hour covered with foil and then finish it uncovered for another 10 minutes. Definitely a keeper, I’ve made it several times!

This was better than I thought it would be.  I did cook the onions first, softening them in the butter. Otherwise, dumped everything in and yum.  Even better the second day!  Wondered about the cream of chicken soup but it blends in and just adds to the creaminess.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great comfort food when it’s single digits! Used chips on top and bacon as well as ham so on the salty side- just the right consistency. Maybe because I didn’t use as many home fries as recipe called for. Will make again for sure!

This recipe was a great way to use leftover ham from Thanksgiving. I read the reviews prior to making which always helps me. The only variations I made was I used extra sharp cheddar cheese, cut the butter to 1/4 cup, a sprinkle of garlic powder and minced onions instead of fresh. I do suggest letting it “rest” before serving. That allows for better presentation :) We enjoyed it and I will make it again.

as i had baked a small ham a couple of days ago- i wanted something different for the leftovers-- this was great-- i found a half a bag of hashbrowns in the freezer- so i cut the recipe in half-- only a couple of small adjustments- first i used half the cheese in the mixture - the other half on top at the 15 minute browning stage- cut the butter to 2 TBLS-- worked fine as i sprayed my pyrex dish-- and since i did not want to waste the half can of soup- ---in it went -so i added a beaten egg  for a binder-- served with yellow and green beans-- great easy dinner--perfect measurements- and perfect timing-- thanks a bunch!!-- oh, i meant to say- hubs is on a high protein diet- so my ham was 12 ounces-- and i kept it large chunks-

Added scallions instead of onions about 3/4 to cup. Used cream of chicken soup with herbs. This casserole is a keeper and everyone enjoyed it. Have made it before as the as the recipe calls for but thought I try something a little different.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. We ended up adding 5 eggs (as suggested by another person) and it was great! This will definitely be a staple dish at my house now.

I made this for dinner last night. I had hash brown patties that I used instead of the bagged.  Other than that, I followed the recipe 100%. Hubby and I both said there was too much butter. He said to just leave it out next time. And there will be a next time. The flavor was very good.

This was a simple recipe to put together, I had leftover ham from Easter & had all other ingredients on hand. This was definitely tasty & my family enjoyed it. For me it  came out like a potatoe soup, very ”liquidy”. Even thou I thawed the hash browns too much liquid. Next time I will not cover with foil & see if it comes out more creamy

I made this last night and it was delicious and easy for a good use of leftover ham.   I did reduce the butter to 1/4 C and used Cheddar Cheese soup instead.    I will be making this again.   Thank you!

Loved the flavor! Recipe states to add salt to taste, but I would omit it. If you use salted butter, ham and cream of Chicken soup the recipe would come out very salty! I would not recommend increasing the cheese. And as noted in other comments the butter should be reduced (very oily-had to blot off excess oil).  My kids loved it though! I agree that this is more of a side dish, but a very easy and yummy one :)

This is a great recipe.  I did make some changes but mainly  because of the items I had on hand.  I had made a pork loin roast the day before and used the leftover in place of the ham.  I think I liked it better than using ham.  The entire family loved it and devoured it in one meal!

My picky children LOVED this! My husband plans to use the leftovers to make breakfast burritos in the morning. I slow cooked a bone-in ham in my crock pot all day, and used that for the cubed ham. I think that really added to the flavor.

Delicious and I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband prefers more tender onions so the only suggestion I have is to saute the onions BEFORE stiring  them into the bowl with the rest  of the ingredients.

Easy and good. I did use olive oil in place of butter, no added salt, and added more seasoning - garlic, dill, Italian seasoning. Hit with whole family, good way to use pre-cooked ham that was on sale at Stater Brothers!

I made this for the first time for a mothers day brunch and everyone loved it.  I basically made as is....maybe a bit extra sour cream as I didn't measure and I added chopped green pepper.  Very good and very easy!

Very, very good. Exactly what I grew up with except I like to put corn flakes on top. I normally will use onions but I have a family member who can't tolerate them. I used a good helping of onion powder this time and I thought it still tasted really good.

This was the best! Definitely saved recipe for the future. I did make a few changes. Instead of the cream of chicken, I used cream of mushroom, I didn't add the butter, and I added alittle extra cheese, and it was PERFECT!

Oh, so good, fast, easy, and makes enough to feed our family of 6 with some leftovers! I love casseroles for their practicality (I have a lot of little people to feed!), and this one is SO good. In the words of my 14-year old daughter, "Ham, cheese, and potatoes? How could you go wrong with THAT!?" :D

Really good simple and quick dish. I use it for my take a meal for new babies or surgeries. I used leftover ham from Christmas but have also used sliced smoked sausage and mini sausages. Sliced hot dogs could also work. I don't make this for home meals because my family does not like hashbrowns, and it is a bit too bland for my taste. I think it would work great as a breakfast side with breakfast sausages mixed in for a brunch

I definitely will make again.  I normally don't make changes to any recipes because it is something shared with us to use. I made a change because I can't eat Cream of Chicken soup. I used Cream of Potato given we were using hash browns and it was wonderful.  Great on football days!!

I made this for church potluck and it was devoured,I  would change up a couple things though not as much onion. I used 1/2 an onion chopped up and a little above a 1/4 c of melted margarine the second time I made it because the first time it was really wet and would not stay together and also you can add a couple eggs which makes it a firmer casserole also. I would make again great flavor.

We make this a lot in our house but we call it cornflake potatoes because the original recipe doesn't have ham and uses chive and onion sour cream (top the tater for you midwesterners) instead of plain. Crush 2C cornflakes and add 1 stick of butter and combine. Add to top for a delicious crumble topping. We do add ham or bacon and call it a meal. So delicious.

My family really loved this comforting casserole.  Made as written, but I did saute the onion.  My family doesn't love onions, and I find when I saute, it is a little easier to sneak them in.  Next time I will sprinkle some garlic powder in the mix and may add something green, either peas or broccali.

This is really good comfort food. We don't eat like this very often but sometimes, it just needs to be done! I have made a similar recipe for cheesy potatoes but adding the ham, was a great idea. I did put the ham in a skillet for a nice sear before cutting it up. This takes the ham to another level. Of course, you have to deglaze your pan and make sure to add to the potatoes. I wondered if it would muddy up the appearance but it absolutely didn't. I also find that I need to cook these potatoes for a while longer than indicated, in fact, when I made it with the ham, I went for 1.5 hours and they were amazing. Thanks!

I’ve made this many times, I’ve added and taken things from it, but it is also delicious as is. I usually add eggs, I’ve poured over too and then baked and also mixed them in. I use about 6-8, family of five, usually everyone has 2 helpings. Ive added garlic, different spices, green pepper, mushroom (really any veggie will work) I’ve also made a large batch for the technicians & office at work, everyone loves it :)

This was totally awesome!    Followed the recipe exactly.  Had O'Brien hash browns in the freezer so that's what I used.  This is really yummy and feeds a lot!  Made a large pan of teriyaki chicken and used this as the side dish.  Great combination!  Everyone in the family can help themselves when they get hungry.  Great recipe!

Great and super simple supper! To lighten it up, I used light sour cream and eliminated the 1/2 cup of melted butter. It was delicious and no one was the wiser! Great homemade taste.
Thanks.

This is a good basic recipe for leftover Easter ham, a bag of shredded potatoes and almost any type of shredded cheese. It's flexible and easy to make. I've made this according to the recipe and I've made substitutions. I once used Campbell's Creamy Poblano Soup in place of the Cream of Chicken.  It gave it a Southwestern touch. I've also replaced the sour cream with a small container of plain Greek yogurt plus about a half cup of milk. It was less calories, was creamy and tasted great. I used the Sweet Vidalia Onions vs. just yellow onions and double the amount. It doesn't overpower the recipe and Sweet Vidalias are welcome in almost every recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover ham and decided to give this one a try.   We are fans of hash brown casserole and this recipe is very similar so it was a hit in my family.  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of butter and onion.

Delicious, but I would also reduce the amount of butter at least by half.  I didn't have any sour cream so I used unflavored yogurt, you  couldn't even tell, and I am sure it is better for you than sour cream.

This was our supper, last night, and I have never seen a casserole dish empty that quick! My husband absolutely devoured it. During the last 15 mins. of uncovered cooking, I lightly covered with buttered panko crumbs. A light dusting of paprika made for a colorful presentation. The only thing I definitely Won't do again - Our store doesn't carry frozen hash browns. I grated my own, no problem. However, we only had rock hard baking Russets. That increased the cooking time to 2+ hrs! Perhaps, that's why my husband was ready to eat a shoe?! Anyhow, decent comfort food recipe for leftover ham .

This is a pretty delicious recipe and I followed the recipe 95% I did not add any salt or pepper and I added what parm cheese I had left in the bag that was in the fridge. DO NOT ADD SALT the ham makes it very salty. When I make it again I am going to try and make it less salty....maybe substitute cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken. Or low sodium options...I may also cook broccoli in it and not on the side next time for a complete one dish meal.

I quintupled this to serve my youth group.  I used some cream of chicken and some cream of celery soup.  At home I might have used mushroom, or made my own white sauce to take the place of the canned soup (medium-thick:  3 T. butter & 3 T. flour to 1 c. liquid, with seasonings and vegetables and liquid as desired).  

Since some reviews said the recipe called for a little too much onion, and since I was feeding kids (middle school and high school), I used just one large onion for the whole 5x recipe.   It was absolutely delicious, and will be on our regular rotation from here on.

This dish is soooooooooo gooooooooood!!  Its addictive.  The only thing I did different was to use "tater tots" since I didn't have hash browns on hand.  I "mashed" them after they defrosted and then proceeded with the recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks for this wonderful dish.

I don't normally change a recipe before I make it.
So, when I made this I only had a 32 oz bag of hash browns. I made according to the recipe except I used too many hash browns, so it looked dry after I cooked it 45 minutes. My husband brought home pizza, so then we cooled and refrigerated overnight. Then I mixed in a can of cheddar cheese soup and a half can of milk and baked for 45 minutes. Best I have ever tasted!I will try it according to recipe exactly next time with cheese soup & see if the taste is that different.

This one is surprisingly good.  My daughter especially enjoyed this one.  My wife and I liked this a lot because it has the "warms you up" comfort food feeling on a cold day.  This is on the menu for tonight.  Definitely can't go wrong with this one - and super easy to make.

This was good, I think it would make a good breakfast or brunch dish.  I added some spices because I know my family likes spicier food, but I'm sure it would taste fine without additions.

This dish was comfort food at its best. Instead of frozen hashbrowns I made my own and I did add more cheese only because I had a bit extra and didn't want to waste anything. I also added a touch of whole milk just to ensure that it wouldn't be to dry. I will be making this again and again.

Very simple to make. Instead of sour cream I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. I only used 3/4 of an onion, I'm glad I did. The flavor was nice, but me and my bf agreed the onion was a bit intense (and we both really like onion). I had made frozen veggies to go along with it, we mixed the veggies into the potato bake and it was perfect! It evened out the flavor nicely, even our two year old liked it! I will definitely be making this again :)

I use 2 cans of soup or more sour cream when I make this. I like it creamy. Also...the addition of asparagus and/or fresh mushrooms is good too. Serve with a salad and bread. Great make ahead dish that you just have to bake on a busy weeknight.

Made this recipe in my crock pot to take for a team dinner for hungry high school soccer girls.  I used broccoli instead of peas. They all loved it. Not a bit left over.

My wife and I do not like ham very much, but it is one of the few things my daughter will eat, so we gave this a try. It is delicious! I have made it several times and it always turns out well.

My mom made this when I was little. It was Ham Slop to us. All she used was potato slices, gradded cheese, ham cubes, a can of mushroom soup (no water added) and salt/pepper. QUICK and AWESOME and you can make  it in a slow cooker too.

I have been making this for years.  I omit the butter and add crushed corn flakes to the top.  It is a family favorite, comfort food and holiday breakfast tradition.  
As a matter of fact, I made it this morning to feed the roofers working on my home!

A wonderful receipe!  Brought it to a church potluck and there was no leftover to bring home.  Followed the recipe exactly but omitted the salt.  Sprinkled crushed potato chips immediately prior to serving. Delicious!

This was really good. I had some leftover ham in the freezer from Christmas that I needed to use up and this did the job. Very yummy and filling. My husband had two plates so it must have been good. A keeper for sure.

I replaced the ham with salami.  I had 25 people for brunch and made a LOT of other dishes.  THIS ONE WENT LIKE CRAZY AND I RAN OUT BEFORE SOME PEOPLE EVEN GOT TO TASTE IT!  It's so easy and so delicious.  I highly recommend it!

This one is a winner in our house.  I don't find to many of the recipes that go over as well as this one did.  I did change the soup to the cream of celery and added celery to the sautéed onion mixture. It is very easy as well.

I have been making this for years , with or without the ham it's a great recipe.  For those of you that think its dry  my recipe calls for two cans of soup (I use mushroom) .   I also don't cover it but sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top if I have it on hand.

I loved this, my mom and boyfriend both like it as well.  My dad didn't really seem to like it but he doesn't like onion he can see.  Next time I make it I'm going to try using an onion soup packet instead of onions to see if my dad will like it that way.  It is a lot creamier when you melt the butter(which I didn't do the first time).  I will definitely make this again in the future.

This recipe is definitely a family pleaser! After reading other reviews I decided to add a little extra sour cream and some milk to make it creamier, which ended up working perfectly. I also added some French fried onions to the top for the last 15 minutes of baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. My picky kids even liked it!

O.M.G! I made this for the first time ever tonight, and it was awesome!! My super picky toddler ate a whole bowl full!! I did use some of the other raters' suggestions though. I made the recipe as listed with the following replacements/additions: no onion- 1 pkg dry onion soup mix instead; added 5 eggs; kalbassa sausage and bacon bits; green onion. Next time I will try adding sliced mushrooms in also. This is now a Monday night, weekly staple!!!

Made this as the main dish to feed 7 mean... not a good calculation on my part!  The guys really liked it and ate it up, good thing I had slices of ham and parmesan buns to serve on the side.  Also, instead of frozen hash browns, I grated 4 cups of potatoes and then it also required longer cooking time.  At any rate, it was very good as is and I can that variations would also be easy.

Very good dish.  I did half the recipe since there is only 2 of us but kept the full 1 cup of ham in.  I was giving it a 4 at first (only because it didn't give me the WOW) but my daughter said it was a 5 because of the comfort food that it is, and I have to agree on that.

Used reduced fat cheddar cheese soup, fat free sour cream, light butter and reduced fat sharp cheddar. Had some broccoli left over so chopped it up and added that and some shredded carrots to make it a one dish meal. Much enjoyed by adults and kids! Will be adding this to my "use all the time" recipes. Pulled it after an hour and tossed some extra cheddar on top. Delicious!

I make this recipe all the time. Sometimes I use ham other times sausage. I also add green peppers and extra cheese. My favorite topping is crumbled harvest cheddar sun chips.
