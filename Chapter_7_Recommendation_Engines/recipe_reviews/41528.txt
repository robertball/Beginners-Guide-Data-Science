This was excellent. I used chex cereal in place of oyster crackers because those are my favorite. I made two different types of party mix, this recipe and the one listed on the back of the chex cereal box and this one was sooooo much better. The other one wasn't baked, and I think that baking it made a big difference in improving the flavor.

This recipe was not bad, I just thought it would have more flavor.  I made it with small pretzels, a mix of Corn Chex and Wheat Chex instead of corn chips, oyster crackers, peanuts and Cheddar Cheese goldfish crackers.  I think you could easily double, or maybe triple, the butter, Worcestershire sauce and seasonings without the flavor being too strong.  I would not make it again without increasing the flavorings.

This stuff is the best party mix I have ever had.  I ran across the recipe last year and made about 4 batches then gave them out as gifts.  I plan on making some more this year...for myself!!!
