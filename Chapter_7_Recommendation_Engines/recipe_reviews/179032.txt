Loved it. Idid exchange the cilantro for fresh spinich and added corn. I also used the black beans with jalepino peppers in them for a little more heat.Next time I'm going to add shredded chicken too. We will be making this often.

BTW, I used whole wheat tortillas, organic canned pinto and black beans, and fresh salsa instead of the Picante sauce, it was still delicious.

This is a good dinner.  I thought it could use some more flavor, but everyone else in the house loved it.  I should also point out that I am the only vegetarian in a house of five.  Its definitely a solid meal I will make again but I will maybe add some roasted garlic and onions next time.  And i will definitely just use some vegetarian refried beans instead of mashing up pinto beans, that was a pain!

This was delicious!!!  I added scallions to this.  Also, I was shocked at how nicely this sliced.   I will definitely be making this again.

I used the premise of this recipe and have varied the amount of layers and the ingredients. It holds up remarkably well to slicing. Versatile, easy prep, delicious. Many thanks, it's on our menu monthly.

This doesn't sound good, sounds more like an appetizer or some kind of football snack food... but this is really good even for a dinner.  For those times when you want a break from meat, this is a great choice.

This was a wonderful dish but very messy. I propose to cut it down to 5 layers with less beans on each layer to make it less sloppy.

It was really easy to make. I added jalepenos for a little kick. I really did not care for the dish though, neither did my husband who loves beans.

Used this as a base recipe: added a whole lot of seasonings, lime juice, sour cream, jalapeno, chipotle pepper, sliced black olives and sliced green onions. A great way to use up an entire packet of flour tortillas!

I fixed this dish here at home and we loved it.  Also, I was visiting with my daughter and her family, fixed this and her husband was crazy over it.  She fixed it again yesterday.  This is a keeper, easy and fairly healthy too.

We all liked this very well. I used parsley instead of cilantro, as my daughter dislikes cilantro. I might mix some taco seasonong in with the beans he next time to spice it up a bit. Thanks!

It is a change from our usual dinner but it still tastes good. I thought it can be a little more "wet". I found it a little dry. Perhaps having some salsa in the layers might help.

I didn't really care for this but my family really liked it. I recommend this to people that like sweet and salty together. I don't like my sweet food mixed with salty or salty with sweet so it just depends on what you like.

My husband called it a homerun!  I skipped the garlic, cilantro and fresh tomatos.  I only had salsa on hand.  It came out awesome with lettuce and sour cream on the side.

The concept was good. I do not like picante sauce so I subtituted taco sauce instead. I think this recipe is great idea and be spruced up to be a great meal.

The sky is the limit with this recipe. You can customize it to suit your taste. I added Mexican seasoned textured vegetable protein on top of the pinto bean layers and slices of smoked Gouda and green onions on the black bean layers. Pass around the hot sauce and Jalapeno slices for added the people that need more heat. Nobody knew this was meatless. Delicious will definitely make again!

Delicious and very satisfying.  I added chopped onion and green chili to the mixture.  Next time I might even chop up some jalapenos for the time.  Another idea I have is to garnish it with a little quacamole on top but there are just so many possibilities.  Easy to make!

This was really yummy and easy.  I didn't feel like defrosting my black beans, so I did mine with just a can of refried beans instead.  It turned out super satisfying and tasty.  I also paired mine with some spicy hot sauce and some sour cream.

Simple, easy to modify to your own tastes, and I probably wouldn't have come up with it on my own.  I topped it with mild salsa and sourcream.  My kids are eating it as I write this!  Thanks!

I too tweaked this recipe.  I read almost all of the reviews first and saw that you could do just about anything and it will come out tasting good.  I mixed my pinto beans with corn, black olives and tomato.  I put this in between my layers and added cheese on top to each layer.  I only made 5 layers.  I served it with the salsa and sour cream.  Good!!

I love this dish.  I don't mash the pinto beans. I just leave them whole and I use a lot more cilantro, probably more like 2 cups.  The fresh cilantro and tomato make it taste really fresh! Serve with sour cream and you have a nice meal.

I've made this twice now and my family has raved! I added a layer of baby spinich leaves the first time, and the second time I sauteed some shredded zucchini and onions to mix with pinto beans. I think you could do whatever you wanted to it and it would come out delicious and it's VERY easy.

Meade with turkey and black beans, added some more diced veg peppers and such, it was so good!! Super easy too, baked in large springform pan for easy cutting after it set.
