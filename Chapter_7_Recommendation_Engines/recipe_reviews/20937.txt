This was fabulous.  I was soo bored with the same old french toast.  Don't be scared by the amount of honey, I started out with only 1 tbsp and after the first slice quickly added the other tbsp.  They were not too sweet at all.  I used light bread and half&half instead of heavy cream.  They came out great.  You have to cook them at a low heat because of all the honey or they will burn quickly.  Definitely a keeper.

The kids and I liked this alright. My kids found more greatness in the french
toast being that they were shaped as stars. I liked that they ate their breakfast without complaint.

I might keep the star idea for next time and use a different french toast dip.

Wow!  We just finished eating this for dinner and I must say that this was by far THE BEST French toast I have ever eaten!  Our sons are huge Batman fans so I used a bat-shaped cookie cutter instead of a star and they loved it!  For bread I used Best Bread Machine Bread from this site, it had just come out of the bread maker and worked out wonderfully for this recipe.  I don't know if it's the difference in using heavy cream in place of milk as in traditional recipes, or the addition of honey, it just was a terrific recipe-unlike any I had ever had before.  Thanks so much for sharing, I can attest that this will be our permanent French Toast recipe from here on out!

Just made these this morning, but didn't add the orange zest because of time. I used day-old Hawaiian bread cut in sticks (they were leftover from the dip last night for the Superbowl) and it was great! I fried them in a thin layer of vegetable oil and they were perfect. I like to sprinkle the cinnamon on while cooking to get it more evenly distributed. These tasted like restaurant quality french toast sticks! Yum!

Cute and creative! This was a proved to be a nice spin on an old favorite. I love french toast and this was a very tasty new way to prepare it especially with the touch of fruit. I used thick cut Texas toast and all I added was a little nutmeg to the egg mixture. When these were nice and crispy I dusted them with powdered sugar, a dollup of butter and drizzled some real maple syrup over top - a really nice treat for breakfast with a glass of OJ!

Great taste! The orange zest gave it a delicious kick. Watch for too much zest on the last few pieces though.

Great flavor!  Rather than waste the rest of the bread, I cooked eggs in the star shaped holes, the same way you would do "eggs in holes!"  The kids thought that was a lot of fun.

Used an egg shaped cookie cutter and Texas Toast (several companies make it, Wonder, Aunt Millie etc.). Very good and easy recipe.  Will make it again Easter morning. Blueberries and strawberries go well with it. Next time, will not add salt when using salted butter to cook. Thanks for recipe.

Best french toast I've ever had.  I completely skip the star cutting part and just leave the shape of the Texas Toast alone.  Don't make the mistake of using half and half instead of heavy cream, it just doesn't turn out as good.  It freezes well too and then toasts up nice.  Thanks for this recipe. 6/4/17 update: for 8 slices of Texas Toast, doubling the mixture barely makes it. Instead of orange zest, I used a few drops of orange extract and now prefer this. Again, best recipe for French Toast!

These have become Christmas morning tradition in our house. They are delicious! I add a bit of ground nutmeg to enhance the aroma.

VERY GOOD!  I liked the orange and cinnamon flavor.  In place of heavy cream, I used half and half.  Instead of cutting out stars, I cut the bread in half and then from corner to corner and stood the pieces up to make it look like a starfish.  I had seen this done before, here at the shore.  I served them with orange slices and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Thank you NIK928 for a VERY GOOD recipe!

Good recipe. I used homemade honey-wheat bread that I had on hand and it turned out very well. The only thing I didn't like was the orange flavour, which took on sort of a 'burnt' taste even though the french toast itself was a light golden brown. I will make this recipe in the future, but I will leave out the orange zest. :) Thanks!

i thought this recipe looked yummy & made it as directed aside from not cutting out the star shapes & only serving it with warm maple syrup. i love oranges but felt their flavor was a little overpowering here. my boyfriend liked the taste much less then i did but he managed to devour his portion plus swipe another piece from my plate (hmmmm). i'll try this again sometime but will cut the orange zest back to 2 teaspoons. thanks yasmeeen!

Way too much orange zest.   I did not care for it at all though I might try to make it without the orange zest next time because the other ingredients do sound delicious.  Sorry.

Awesome! The orange zest and splash of vanilla did it for me. I used homo milk and think the cream would make it even better. Next time I will plan ahead and leave my bread slices to dry out overnight.

This was a tasty variation that I've seen before (with the orange zest). I did like the use of the cream instead of milk (I used fat free half & half) because it made the "dip" mixture thicker so it didn't saturate my bread as much. The only trouble is, the honey causes it to have a tendency to burn (from the sugar content). So, be wary of that and cook slow & low (but not too low or it won't cook right!)

Wow, my entire family told me this was the best breakfast they had ever had! Granted, I have not experimented with french toast recipes very much, but this one is a fantastic starting point. The orange flavor really came out. I used King's Hawaiian bread, and cut it fairly thick. Next time, I would double the egg mixture- I never have enough to do all my bread, but maybe I just cut it too thick. The orange and honey do sink to the bottom a bit, but I had my son whisk it between every few slices. The last two still came out very orangey, but still fantastic! Will definitely make this again.

YUM! I will have to update after I make this again... I didn't have an orange, so I used orange juice. No cream either, so I used milk... but this was a wonderful recipe! I loved the honey and cinnamon, with a hint of orange. This is a new favorite!

Really, really yummy. The cream pushes these over the top- I don't know, it just makes the texture heavenly. (And I used low fat cream.) I skipped the zest and doubled up on the vanilla. Our favourite way to serve this is with that thick, fresh, crusty white French bread you get in the grocery store's bakery section. We fry it in a bit of canola oil and top with warm maple syrup.   Just a thought: I've never tried the star variation, but wouldn't it be easier in some ways to make the french toast THEN cut it into stars or other shapes? And then snack on the edges :) That way the points wouldn't be breaking off in the egg mixture. Just an idea.

Delicious - I followed this recipe using thick sliced cinnamon orange bread from our grocery store bakery and prepared as regular french toast (did not cut into shapes).  The entire family loved it - nice delicate orange flavor.  Thanks for this keeper!

Very delicious and easy to make. I just used whole slices of whole wheat bread though. I'm sure the stars would be just as yummy!

Great Recipe!!! I made this for my family when they were visiting, everyone enjoyed it! I used a loaf and french bread cut into thick slices, and followed the recipe exactly.  My kids especially loved it, they were eating leftovers all day long!

Just tried this recipe, down to earth beautiful breakfast a little on the naughty side though. I would suggest strong caution with how much butter you use, but if you follow the recipe and use milk instead of butter you get this even better version with a crunchy outside and a sweet soft centred inside, so i give this version 4 stars and mine 4& 1/2

I didn't use stars cause I didn't want to waste bread. But this recipe was a waste of calories anyway. It doesn't taste special at all with the heavy cream and it's a little too orangey. I didn't hate it, it was definitely edible, but I won't make it again.

The french toast has a very good taste.  A really good difference from the regular french toast.  The only problem I had is they were a little to sweet for me.  Next time I will cut back on the honey.

This is the BEST french toast recipe I have ever tried!  I left the orange zest out...I don't think I'd like it with it.  I made them into finger slices and cooked on low like some of the other posters suggested. They turned out perfect and I will be making these again!

I did modify this recipe a lot, but I still believe it is worthy of the five stars. I craved them all day long after breakfast! Okay, my dh doesn't like sweet things usually with his eggs or french toast. He prefers the savoury flavour. I decided to make these, modifying for his taste and I used 5 kid's size eggs (500g), half a cup of thickened cream, 1/4 cup organic, unhomogenized milk, 1 tblspn of honey, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, the grated zest of one small orange, about 1/4 tsp (to get a tblspn is heaps!) and a small squeeze of the juice into egg/cream mix. I more or less, only added small amounts of the honey and spices, so he would like it. He told me later that it was alright, but he likes just plain egg and milk better. I LOVED IT!!!! Seriously, I would not like it any sweeter than what I had it, and my dd didn't like it either, but ds and I loved it.

These were yummy!  I didn't bother making stars, I just used some Italian bread leftover from dinner the night before.  I also used dried orange peel, which was okay.  I suspect the recipe will be even better with fresh orange zest.

I used wheat bread instead of white.  The bread was fragile not only cutting out the star shape but after dipping in the egg mixture.  I also used Agave instead of honey.  I think if I were to make these again I would try a heartier grain bread.

Yum!!  I love this recipe!  My only issue was that the honey hardened a bit when I added the cold eggs, so next time I may let the eggs warm up a bit before adding them.  But it was no big issue, I just made sure I did a good mixing job.  Otherwise, no complaints!  Very good!!

Definitely restaurant quality! My husband requests them constantly now. When I don't have fresh orange zest I use juice. The honey, orange and vanilla combo is superb. A definite keeper in my house.

I have always loved French toast.  It is, without a doubt, my favorite thing to order from a breakfast restaurant.  I've wondered many times why it never tastes quite the same when I make it at home.  This recipe is to die for perfect.  I used hearts instead of stars and made a butterfly using two hearts and bacon for my daughters.  It was a huge hit with them and a huge hit with me!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I use diferent cookie cutters to make sandwiches for my son for school; when boring old bread becomes a "snowman sandwich" or a christmas tree..... they are the "star" of the classroom.   Great idea for picky eaters!

Great French toast recipe. I baked my own bread in a star shaped pan to keep from having bread scraps left over. However, bread scraps could be ground into crumbs.

I liked it.  A nice change from the usual.   I didn't do the stars, I just wanted to try the recipe.

It would be nice for Allrecipes to create a breakfast tab/box for breakfast foods in the recipe box.

I followed the recipe and used day old french bread, sliced thick. My husband said it was some of the best french toast he has ever had!

Made this for my husband for breakfast today and he loved the orange zest. I also used whole wheat bread turned out great.

My husband loved them. I didn't like them so much but only because I switched to whole grain bread. Somehow the mixture didn't soak in that much and it ended up very separated from the bread. Maybe I did something wrong.

This was a great french toast recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I used four thick slickes (about an inch to inch and a half thick) of day old Chiabatta bread. One recipe coating four thick slice. I agree that once it gets going, it cooks fast to keep the temperature low. Great flavor!

so quick, easy and delicous. I've been making this recipe for a few months now and everytime it's a hit, with no leftovers. I always use regular sliced bread and it works out fine. Low heat is the key. I've used half and half and heavy cream with no difference in the results. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best french toast I have ever had.  This is my new recipe I love the subtel taste of cinnamon and I love that it is sweetened with honey rather than sugar.  (We used dinosaur cutouts for the little ones) Thank you

I had to add syrup, it wasn't sweet enough. But that's good, there's nothing worse than something being too sweet and having a ruined batch of something. I agree that the cream really makes it yummy. (I don't have kids so I didn't do shapes, but I sliced 4 pcs of toast in half and it was the perfect amount for the rest of the ingredients!)

Wow! Absolutely wonderful! I just made this this morning for Easter, and everyone loved it. Including my 3 yr old who doesn't like anything! Instead of star shapes, I did chicks, and the kids sprinkled powdered sugar on theirs. I will never make regular french toast again.

Very good. I liked addition of the orange flavor in this. I had 3 sizes of star cookie cutters, the largest was by far the easiest and had less tearing of bread. This is a cute idea and can be changed up to suit specific holidys using different shapes. Thanks this was a great meal and looked cute too!

Delicious! My new default French toast. I did do a couple things differently, however.  I used a tablespoon of triple sec in place of the orange peel as I had no oranges. The orange flavor didn't come through as well as I had expected, so next time I will use more of the liqueur or an actual orange.  Watch out for cinnamon clumps in the batter! I should have used a whisk to mix to ensure homogeneity.  There wasn't enough batter left to completely coat the eighth slice, but this may be because I used regular white bread which is a bit spongy and could have soaked up more than thicker bread.  Cooked on medium-low heat as recommended and the slices came out perfectly (I prefer softer slices) with a bit of browning on the outside.  To serve I drizzled on honey and sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top, sopaipilla-style. Fantastic! The heavy cream provides a bit of richness (but not too much) and the toast is very satisfying. Yum! Also received top scores from SO who drizzled chocolate syrup on his.

Delicious- but it was difficult to mix together the honey with the rest of the mixture. I also decided to use Orange Marmalade instead of Orange Zest, which may have added to the thickness, but was definitely worth the hard work.

I did not have cream so I just used milk.  I can't compare but it was great with milk.  I did not use the orange zest as I did not think the kids would like it.  Be careful how hot the burner or you will burn the butter.

Our search for a french toast recipe is now over!  We don't cut them into stars so we can get 5 thick pieces of white bread with the amount of liquid the recipe makes.  We've used cream, half and half, and even 2% milk and all of them have great end results.  We use less butter, about 1 tbsp for each round of french toast (3).  Make this about once a week!

Only warning I'd give is that if you are using whole slices instead of stars (or cutouts of any kind) then you need to double the recipe as there was not enough egg mix for the slices of bread I was trying to cook.  Even still - my third slice had smidges of the egg mix and it was still most excellent.  My husband and I have both shied away from french toast because we had too many soggy bread versions as kids.  This, however, had fantastic flavor and was cooked through so no complaints on either of our parts and we are now lovers of french toast!

Very tasty.  I've made these twice in one week.  Nearly followed the recipe exactly the first time, except that I substituted orange extract for the zest and used a little less salt.  They were delicious.  I'm not a huge french toast fan and I liked them.  Even my three picky kids liked them.  Second time I made them, I was out of cream, so I substituted whole milk--just as wonderful.  Husband, who tried the lower fat version, said this is the BEST FRENCH TOAST he has ever had.  I used King's Hawaiian Bread.  Very easy to whip up.

Awesome french toast! My kids wanted breakfast for dinner and I used thick white french toast bread and made exactly as directed. My girls ate it without anything on it, one son ate it with powdered sugar sprinkled on and one with syrup. I ate it plain it was so good. My kids wanted it the next morning and my husband made it with whole wheat bread and no orange zest. I wasn't there, but they all loved it.

Yummy!  Both my husband and I enjoyed this scrumptious recipe!  We'll be using it in future, for certain.

We especially liked that it's mostly a heathy breakfast.  I substitued reduced fat organic milk for the cream, and I used whole wheat toast.  Topped with pure maple syrup, it was the best!

I didn't cut any shapes, but I just cut the slices diagonally.  We found that the egg mixture is enough for about 6 whole slices.

Excellent!  Easy!  Fast!  Normally, I wouldn't go to the trouble of using heavy cream in a recipe like this. However, I had some whipping cream left over from something else, so I used that.  The result was wonderful.  I only used half of the orange zest and that seemed to be enough.  My husband and I were looking around for more bread to make more.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It tastes just like the french toast you would pay $30 a plate for at a nice restaurant.  I used Hawaiian sweet bread that you can buy at the grocery store and did not cut into stars.  I cooked on the griddle with a little bit of butter.  I mixed together raspberries, blackberries & strawberries with a teaspoon of sugar and spooned it on top of the french toast, then topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is the best french toast I've ever had!  If you don't like the orange taste, just omit the zest.

Awesome flavor!  Not too sweet, just right.  I didn't have the orange zest this time but will try this recipe again with it since many say it adds to the wonderful flavor.  I skipped the cinnamon since I used fresh cinnamon bread from a local bakery.  Finally don't have to go to a local restaurant to get fabulous tasting french toast!

Incredible taste!
I went a little over board with the orange zest.  I'll follow the recipe a little closer next time.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was especially yummy and cooked up beautifully (even if we didn't cut into shapes). We like our french toast a little on the sweet side, so I added about a tblsp of white sugar and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. The orange zest really makes the difference. I used Texas toast and the recipe only made 4 fluffy slices, which was perfect for my husband and me. But you might want to increase recipe if you are feeding more :-)!

These were excellent.  I found a bottle of dried orange zest in the spice island - more convenient than zesting an orange!  Since these were cooked in butter, they didn't need butter spread to them after the fact - just some syrup!

fyi: tripling this recipe served 6 hungry people, and took one loaf of bread.

I will definately be making these again.  The only change I made was to add more vanilla and that's just a taste preference.   One of the best french toast recipes I've ever used.

I could eat French toast every day, but I often get tired of the same old boring egg and milk batter.   When I saw this recipe, I had to give it a try.  Hands down, this is one of the best, company worthy recipes I’ve had in a long time.  Loved the honey, cinnamon, orange combo.  I did not want to waste, so I used the entire piece of bread and cut the stars out after it was cooked.  I didn’t mind eating the scraps while I saved the stars for the photo op.  Stars aside, I will be making this one often!

These were really cute! I used thick Texas toast and they were delicious.  I ended up making croutons with the leftover scraps of bread. I made these for Memorial day breakfast and I plan on making these again for Fourth of July.

This recipe made excellent French toast. Just make sure you pay attention and don't put the butter into the mix. (oops!) It made the mix a little thick but it still tasted great on thick egg bread.

This was excellent! I didn't cut the bread and I found that i only needed four slices of regular bread (I used a high-fiber bread).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!

Made these for my ultra picky 6 yo. son this morning. He won't eat anything for breakfast so I decided to give these a try. I didn't have star cookie cutters but I had a heart shape one so I did four small hearts and arranged it like a four leaf clover. I also had to substitute sugar for the honey and didn't use orange zest. The presentation was great but the taste was to die for. He wolfed them down and said they were delicious and said he wanted them for dinner too LOL. I tried a few bites that he didn't finish and he was right. This recipe is awesome. YUM!

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have orange so I used lemon zest. I also replaced the cream with soy milk. Best french toast I have had in a long time.

Pretty good recipe.  It was nice to try something new.  I didn't have any orange zest for I used dried orange peel.  I just used whole slices of Texas toast.

I did not have any cream so I used 2% milk, I also did not have orange zest but still this is the best French toast ever.  My #1 critic really liked this recipe.  I will make this again and again.

I made it with grated orange and lemon peel instead of orange zest, and didn't make shapes. It was Fantastic!!! I made it for my husband for a Valentine's Breakfast, and he said it was the best french toast he has EVER had!

I LOVED this recipe! My husband did not care for the orange zest, however, I thought it was great. I did use about a Tbs instead of 2 of the orange and it worked out great.Thanks!

Excellent!  We used clementine zest instead of orange zest (just because we had them), half and half instead of cream, and wheat bread.  Using whole, uncut slices of bread, the egg mixture was enough for 4-5 slices.  Excellent combination of flavors and just sweet enough.  Doesn't need a topping, but maple syrup or a light drizzle of a powdered sugar and milk glaze would be great additions to highlight the flavor.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

this recipe is wonderful.  it has such a light, tasty flavor..however, next time, i would NOT fry in butter...it had way too strong a butter taste, which took away from the orange and cinnamon, in my opinion.  i would rather use a good nonstick skillet and avoid using a greasing agent entirely.

I woke up this morning not knowing what to eat and I came across this recipe. Fortunately, i had all the ingredients minus the orange zest lying around so i tried it. This is such an easy recipe and the taste is pretty good. I only used 4 slices of wheat bread to make it a little healthier and I cut each slice into four pieces. I let them sit for a while in the mixture and that's probably why I only used 4 slices. But i would do this again because the slices were juicy and warm and really soft. I didn't use the orange zest but I definitely can see how it would taste good. The honey is a nice touch to it as well. I also recommend to leave the temp on med-low so that it doesn't burn because they cook fast. Overall it was delicious and I will probably make some more and put them in the freezer for my boyfriend to just microwave and eat in the mornings.

we loved this recipe. small changes that i made include using half the salt, didn't have orange zest so used extract, also doubled the cinnamon. served this with the best ever pancake syrup from this site. only thick bread that i had was barbecue bread and it worked great. with that type of bread recipe only coated four pieces.

Although I chose not to cut the bread into star shapes, I did follow the recipe to a "T".  I loved the orange flavor, although I think I may cut it in half next time.  My family enjoyed this recipe and we'll keep it as a regular.

I didn't cut them into stars, and I added a little milk to thin it out and stretch it for my family. We love them, but probably because it is very similar to the one I have been making for years. I just don't add honey and orange zest to my original recipe.

Wow! This is fantastic french toast! I made little stars and some other shapes for my boys and gave them strawberry yogurt to dip them in. I just made it regular for me and ate it with the "absolute best pancake syrup" from here because its my favorite and it was soooo good. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Used Orange Honey instead of adding in orange zest and it turned out just great! Probably not as orange-y in flavor, but still yummy.

Yummy! I made this recipe this morning for mother's day breakfast. I left out the orange zest (due to citrus allergies!) but even still, this is the best FT recipe I've come across. The kids kept saying how it tastes exactly like restaurant breakfast. :)

This was absolutely delicious! I used regular whole wheat bread.  My son who doesn't like anything ate these without syrup in about 5 minutes.  It usually takes him an hour and a ton of threats for him to finish any meal.  My husband (who doesn't like anything against the norm), loved these.  Definitely add the orange zest, my picky eaters weren't scared off and it definitely made a beautiful difference in the taste.

1.13.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20937/french-toast-stars/ ... While I did make changes to adjust the flavor, I'm still gonna review this.  :o  I didn't add the honey or zest.   Mediumhigh heat was a bit high.  This is what I'd think French toast would taste like made with cinnamon bread.  Good, but - just my buds - better without the cinnamon.  'Low on milk, heavy cream in the fridge, this was a good choice.  'Didn't do the stars, but briilliance ahead >>> 
Judy Bluiss' review:  Great flavor! Rather than waste the rest of the bread, I cooked eggs in the star shaped holes, the same way you would do "eggs in holes!"

I am not a big French toast fan, but I liked it very much. I used sliced white bread whole and skipped the orange zest. I did add maybe 1/8 tsp of nutmeg instead. Only had half-and-half so that was what I used. Served it with powdered sugar and scrambled eggs. "Yum! Keep the recipe," said the husband.

I didn't really make any changes except I doubled the recipe and I sort of winged it on the orange zest. I essentially used one large orange. 

The toast came out really good. you could definitely taste the cinnamon just enough and a hint of orange to brighten it up. 

I roasted some pecans in butter and used them as a topper with syrup.

Our 4 year old son loved these so much he coukd not wait to have Daddy eat them with him.
Only changes were, whole milk, orange extract and we used cinnamon chip bread.
Both my guys had with butter and maple syrup and enjoyed every bite.  Will definitely make these again.
Our son loved to use the cookie cutter to make the stars.

I used regular sized bread and it was enough for four slices.  The last two had more of an orange taste as the zest sunk to the bottom of the bowl.  Next time I will stir before each dip.  I did not have cream but the skim milk I used was just fine.  A nice change and it was sweet enough without powdered sugar on top.

I did reduce the cinnamon by half to bring out more of the orange flavour.  Alternately, you can add a splash of orange  brandy to the melted butter in your pan before browning the toast, or add the liquor to the maple syrup you will be pouring over the toast.  Squeezing fresh orange juice over the toast is another way to add some tang without the syrup or the alcohol.

I’m going to try this when I visit my dad. He’ll enjoy the novelty of star-shaped French Toast. I’m sure it’ll be a hit.

SO EASY and by far the best French Toast recipe I've ever had.  I make exactly as the recipe calls using Texas Toast bread.  It makes 4 pieces, which is perfect for my 4 person family.  If I had to make two batches, I'd probably make 4 and then make a second mixture for the next for just to be sure it distributed properly.  

This is now a weekend staple in our household!

This turned out great! I substituted the orange zest for fresh ground Nutmeg and coconut milk from I can instead cream.  Quick and easy.

I added 1/4 cup flour for fluffiness and left out the orange zest.  Also, I did not cut it into stars because that is less French Toast to enjoy.  So good!

Just what I expect from a french toast recipe. I used Saralee Artesano bread (my favorite for french toast). Those are large slices, so it only used half as much bread.

Too much salt. I'd recommend a pinch of salt if making eight and only 1/4 tsp if making 16 slices.

Yum! Love the honey taste in the mix. I didn't put the orange zest in it but still awesome. I have no kids, so i made stick type. Shape doesn't made it taste less delicious :) The video said leave two mins on each side. This really depends on the heat of the pan. I have the heat on low but still need only 1mins or less on each side.

What a great way to use up heavy cream! I didn’t have orange zest, but it still turned out well.  I didn’t have enough honey either so i substituted with brown sugar.  After flash cooking the egg mixture on the pan, i put all the bread slices in the toaster oven on medium high, as my kids like their toast crispy.  They topped it with whipped cream and finished it right up.  I agree that there’s something to the heavy cream that changes up the texture nicely.

My super finicky 4-year-old loves this French toast, and so do I!  I don't bother cutting them into stars anymore, since you waste a lot of bread that way.  The only change I made was not adding the Orange zest (and only bc I didn't have any oranges on hand-- I hate when people rate a recipe they completely change!).  It still comes out delicious, and I've just kept making it that way.  My only recommendation is to stir the batter before dipping slices of bread, since the honey tends to sink to the bottom of the bowl.  Great recipe!
