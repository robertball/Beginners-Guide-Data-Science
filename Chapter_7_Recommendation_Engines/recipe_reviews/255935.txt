I had a hard time deciding whether to give this 4 or 5 stars...and finally went with 4. To be honest, I felt the recipe title was misleading. I was expecting the recipe to have some pumpkin puree in it. It is instead just your average snickerdoodle cookie, with some extra spices thrown in. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, as nearly everything from Chef John does!

In all my years of baking, I have never made snickerdoodles but when I saw this recipe, I decided to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly (who can argue with Chef John's recipes) and they turned out just about the best sugar-type cookies I have ever made.  My husband is very fond of spicy desserts and this really made his day.  They were soft the day they were made and a little crunchy the following days.  No matter what, they were very good and I am sure to make them again.  Very easy to make.

These were so good! I loved the mix of spices & that they're made with all butter, not shortening. My family loved them. The cookies spread more than I was expecting, so just be aware of that.

I love snickerdoodles and have been making them for over 40 years. I read the recipe and immediately whipped up a batch.
They were delicious! My husband, who does not normally eat snickerdoodles, was drawn in by the smells filling my kitchen.
Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to share my snickerdoodles. LOL

I made these exactly as the recipe ordered.  I live at a higher altitude, so I had to bake them for about 14 minutes and they came out more fluffy and cakey.  Overall a wonderful cookie!

Every time I make these, they're gone before you know it. I skip the cloves since I hate the taste and add a little extra of the other spices to give a stronger flavour.

Snickerdoodles aren't something I make a lot, but Chef John's version with extra fall spices are yummy!  Followed the recipe exactly, including refrigerating an hour before baking.  Baked the first two batches 11 minutes, and the last batch (just 3) for 9 minutes, just to see the difference.  Think 11 was a little long - would stick with 9 next time for a little softer cookie.  Only complaint is that this only yielded 2 dozen cookies (27, to be exact) ... need to double the recipe and freeze some!

I thought these would have pumpkin puree in them and was  surprised they didn't. But they are wonderfully delicious  without it. Chef John always comes through.

Delicious!!!  I was not expecting them to be this good.  I made them with King arthurs gluten free flour, earths balance margarine and organic sugar.  My gluten loving husband said they were the best snickerdoodles he ever had - which is saying a lot since his mother bakes all the time.  I haven't baked in ages so it was a nice surprise.  Kids had fun baking too.

Made these and liked them better than the typical Snickerdoodle.   Only change I made was to bake the at 400 instead of 350 and adjusted the time down a minute due to the nature of my oven.

I’ve made this a few times and it NEVER disappoints. I mixed it by hand, just as John suggests, and it turned out perfect every time. The first few times I substituted an equal amount of “pumpkin pie spice” for all the spices listed and it tasted about the same as following the recipe using the spices listed. Also, I chilled the dough for 45 mins to anhiur

Fantastic!  Made them exactly according to the recipe. These are by far the best snickerdoodles I've ever tasted. As others have noted, they do spread out to be rather large.  I only got 16 cookies.  Will need to make a lot more!

Didn't bother with the glaze - they don't need it

I made these for the kids for Thanksgiving and they were a hit.  Nice and chewy with great pumpkin pie spice flavor.  The only thing I did different was add a pinch of the spice to the rolling sugar for extra flavor.  Will definitely make again; maybe even as a Christmas cookie instead of plain snickerdoodles.

Not as crispy as snickerdoodles. Was that because of using butter instead if shortening? The pumpkin pie seasoning made them great! My only regret is that since this is such a small batch, I will never find out if they are crispier after a day!

Made these to bring into the office, my head manager, who is an executive, told me that these were some of the best cookies he’s ever had. That’s some serious praise and definitely earned me some brownie points. Really though, followed this recipe to a tee and they were delicious. Will be adding to my recipe box!

Followed recipe exactly, just the right amount of spices for ice cream sandwiches using vanilla ice cream.  Will make cookies a little smaller as even adults felt like one sandwich was a lot to eat!

I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and these turned out great!  Next time I might increase the amount of nutmeg as well.  Brought them to a potluck, and they disappeared quickly.

These cookies are wonderful.  I made a batch of them and brought them to my daughter's job while they were still warm.  She and her co-workers devoured them within 15 minutes.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe Chef John.

These are SO good and 10x better than a normal snickerdoodle. I wouldn't say pumpkin flavor specifically, more like a general spice  but to be honest I think I prefer that because I then I can make them year round.  I followed the recipe exactly, but ran out of time and wasn't able to put my second batch in the refrigerator. They still tasted great, they just came out a different shape (more flat) than the batch I did refrigerate.

I made this recipes as is except substituted aquafaba for the egg due to my daughters egg allergy.  These were amazing!!!  Definitely a new staple cookie in our home.  Every loved them.  So soft and the spices are perfect.

They did not spread like photo and I'm unsure about the kosher salt, depends on what your taste buds want. They are good; I dipped the mounds in butter icing and everyone said they were awesome! Thanks for the recipe! Will be making them again.

Yummy.  None were left after Thanksgiving dinner.  I did make one small change and made the cookies smaller since our family has a number of children and they like small cookies.  I used about  1 tablespoon of batter for each cookie.

Very disappointing.  Followed recipe to the letter but they did not come out like the snickerdoodles I have had before.  They were cake-y and did not have much flavor.

I'm not a baker by any stretch, but after watching the video recipe I became obsessed with making these. Oh. My. Goodness! One of the best cookies I've ever tasted, let alone made! Don't be worried if they seem a little soft if you take them out after 11 minutes- they'll firm right up but stay wonderfully soft in the middle. Don't need another cookie recipe!

These cookies are really good! I omitted the allspice because I didn't have any but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.
