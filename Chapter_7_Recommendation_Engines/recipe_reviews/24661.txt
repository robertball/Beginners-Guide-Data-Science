I make a very similar recipe that I would consider a 5 star recipe... however... I use cottage cheese, cream cheese (1/2 a brick, I believe - I'll double check)and bleu cheese - no sour cream.  I throw all 3 ingredients into the food processor and blend and then add finely chopped pecans or walnuts.  I serve it with crackers and thin slices of granny smith apples (soaked in lemon water to prevent browning).  A friend that loves the recipe has dubbed it as "Cheese Goo".

Very yummy dip! I used whipped cottage cheese and low fat sour cream. I used a whole cup of the cheese and added a little garlic and onion powder to the mixture. Thanks ladies!

I use equal parts mayo, sour cream, cottage cheese and add a tablespoon or so of dry ranch dressing mix along with some garlic. YUM! But this recipe as written is 5 star worthy too!

Nice! I like the texture of the cottage cheese in this. I might go a little heavier on the green onion and blue cheese, but the flavor does develop as it chills so make sure you make it ahead of time - its pretty light when you first blend it. We had this with hot wings, veggies and apples. Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the sour cream in half and added a half a block of cream cheese.  It was wonderful.  I spread it on french bread and topped it with cucumber.  Elegant and simple.

I used "lite" cottage cheese and lowfat sour cream. I did throw in a couple more chopped green onions, more bleu cheese and I went very heavy on the dill. The longer this sits, the better it tastes. My whole family liked this dip.

Not the best dip I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exact and it was very bland.  And even with using small curd cottage cheese the lumps were still unpleasant.  It ended up tasting like cottage cheese overpowered with blue cheese.  Will not make again.

This is makes a very tasty spread, but it's a bit too thick and cheesy to be used for dipping vegetables.  It was very good with toasted slivers of bread, though.  My husband thought it was a little bland, so make sure to use enough green onions and dill (I may have skimped a little on the green onions).

I made this dip for my best friend's bridal shower - every one loved it, even my mom who hates blue cheese.  Very good and very easy.

This was excellent. I was looking for something without mayo and here it is. Very creamy and mild tasting. Perfect for serving to guests who may or may not be blue cheese lovers. In order to make up for the lack of tanginess present in the usual mayo based recipes I added a bit of white vinegar, although this recipe is great with or without. We had this on homemade burgers.

Doesnâ€™t last long! Everyone seems to like this one, there is none leftover after a party or potluck. Easy to make. Has become a staple to prepare for gatherings of any kind.
