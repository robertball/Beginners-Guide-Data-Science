Really delicious - but when I bit into them, they crumbled and collapsed - nothing but air in the middle (explains why they are only 19 calories!). But nevertheless weirdly addictive and so good. Very easy to make, if you know how to whip up stiff peaks with eggs whites (and not over-beat!) you can make these. I didn't have blocks of chocolate, so I used Callebaut chocolate chunks and further cut them up with a knife. It makes for uneven bits of chocolate but in my opinion it makes the cookies even better, because sometimes you get a surprise chunk of chocolate when you bite into the cookie. Next time I will add a bit of chili and cinnamon.
