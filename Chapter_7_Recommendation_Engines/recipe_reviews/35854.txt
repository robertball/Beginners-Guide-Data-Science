I made this for last months girls nite and the ladies loved it. But instead of pouring the rum in the watermelon, I cut the melon into bite sized chunks and marinated it overnight in Pineapple flavored rum. I then made a punch out of Melon Verdi & Ginger ale and drained the rum off the watermelon and added the melon to the punch. It was the best summer drink we ever had.

this has been a staple at every outdoor and/or summery gathering i hold or go to for years. if you want something really wild, try it with half citrus vodka and half watermellon schnapps. the taste keeps people coming back for more, and the drunken hilarity that's sure to follow makes it definitely worth it.

Try Malibu rum - the end result (not kidding) tastes kind of like cotton candy! Serve while still cold.

Jeez...bringing back memories. We used to cut a small lid & then hollow out the melon. Strain the juice discard the meat and return the juice to the shell, with a can of frozen lemon/lime & a quart of vodka or gin and a pile of crushed ice. Put the lid back on, plunk it on the beach with a pair of sunglasses & a ball cap with a few lengths of rubber tubing & well *hic*

We used Pure Grain because we didn't want to taste the alcohol, we just wanted to taste the fruit and shall I say "feel the drink?". This fit the bill nicely. Thanks :)

Hmmm... this didn't work as nicely as I expected. My watermelon was not absorbing the alcohol so I had to take the funnel out and directly insert the bottle into the watermelon. I am not sure how much actually made it in there. Besides all of that, it was quite tastey. Definately serve cold. Once it is room temp the alcohol flavor becomes strong. If I do this again I will let cut up watermelon soak in a bowl of alcohol. I think more would be absorbed rather than wasted.

This was a big hit at a recent BBQ.  We cut the watermelon up into chunks and soaked it in rum and a bit of watermelon martini mix for a little extra flavor.  It was great, especially the last few pieces left soaking in the rum all night.  When you go to serve it, the colder the better on this one.

Let it soak for as long as you possibly can- adding a handle of vodka to a watermelon for about 45 minutes tastes horrible.  Rather like eating watermelon out of a small pool of vodka.

I'm giving it 4 stars because the watermelon didn't absorb the vodka (used vodka instead of rum) at all. I had put my watermelon initially into a bowl that fit it and the bowl had all the vodka at the bottm after a few hours. I decided then to take out the watermelon, cube it and pour the remaining vodka onto it. It was STRONGGGGG, I used watermelon vodka. will made again maybe with more fruit other than watermelon. Thanks for the idea.

After reading about folks struggling to get desired results, I tried to follow the review that suggested cutting a small lid out of the melon, scooping out the flesh, straining the juice, and then mixing in limeade and vodka together in the melon. But my melon cracked apart the second I went to cut it. So I went ahead and strained the juice out of the flesh, and put it into a clear pitcher so we'd see the nice pink color. My melon was small and I got a little under a half gallon of juice. I mixed in about 6oz of frozen limeade, 2 cups vodka, and 1/4 cup sweetened lime juice. Wonderful! Even though this idea strays from the original recipe, you still get the watermelon/booze combo, which is what we're all looking for anyway. :)

This was my first time doing it and I found that the vodka didn't really soak in much.  I was told later to let the extra juice from the watermelon drain before adding the vodka.  It was still a big hit, but I had to let the watermelon soak for 2 days to try and get any alcohol to soak in; I also poked holes with a chop stick to give the liquid a direction to flow.

Thanks for the great Idea but It didnt go as well as I hoped.  I cut a small hole in the top and just inverted a vodka bottle in it and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I got it out and none of the vodka had seeped in.  I did what this recipe called for and used a funnel.  It still didnt want to go inside the watermelon.  From reading the mixed reviews from some people it worked for and others like me that it didnt.  The only thing I can think of is maybe the juiciness of the watermelon.  Mine was pretty juicy, so it may not of let anymore liquid in.  So I just cut it all up and threw some different rums over it to get the spiked effect.  It was okay for me.  Honestly I thought it ruined the watermelon flavor.  But its a great idea and I may try to make it again sometime!  Thanks!

Never could master this one...we would cut a hole the size of the bottle and tip the vodka bottle right in to it. It seemed to never get past that center part of the melon..and...whoa...it was awful!

I've tried several different liquors, everclear, vodka, and rum. I prefer the flavored vodka, and also letting it soak overnight in fridge. Also, if you are gonna cut it up, add cherries, they are good soaked in vodka.

I loved this and so did my guests.  I will also try the watermelon - cut up - soaked in the vodka, because it was a little tricky to slice the watermelon when we were ready to serve it.

My grandpa and his brothers used to do this when they'd all go out and spend the day on the river.  They'd sink the watermelon in the river while they'd have a good time, then pull it up and it'd be ice cold and ready to cut.

We decided to cut the watermelon into chunks and "marinate" it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours in Smirnoff Watermelon flavored vodka since my DH said that this way is pretty messy (he is the former party animal of our family! LOL) Everyone loved it although I thought the alcohol taste would be disguised a little more effectively!

We used vodka for this but I think next time we'll need to add more because none of us could really taste the liquor. Really good though and thanks.
