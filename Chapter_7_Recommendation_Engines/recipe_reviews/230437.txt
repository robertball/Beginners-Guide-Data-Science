This was great!  I used a mixture of  2 delicata squash, a potato, an onion, and lots of orange, purple and yellow carrots.  The seasoning is really tasty - although I did use half of the amount of spices called for.  Mine was ready in a little under an hour.  This would make a really great holiday side dish.

Very, very nice recipe. The vinegar and lemon give this a nice tang, the diversity of the vegetable flavors are quite complementary to this.  I added some salt-less seasoning instead of salt. Leftovers turned into a lovely and rustic soup. Thank you Snowbunny for you recipe.

I used the juice of one whole lemon and quarter cup red wine vinegar. We used the leftovers in soup. Very good the next day. I might try the fresh herbs next time. We used ground thyme and it was a little over powering, however great for the soup.

I made this last night for a Christmas Bunco party.  My house smelled wonderful and everyone loved it!  I couldn't find a rutabaga, but had some golden beets, so I used them instead.  Delicious!

I was skeptical about using dried herbs but thought I'd give it a try since they're so much cheaper than fresh.  I doubled the recipe for a large crowd but ended up using only half the amount of herbs, and it was still way too herby. The dish would have been inedible if I'd used the full amount. I found the texture of dried herbs in a dish with no liquid unpleasant.

I substituted the veggies I had on hand-squash, zucchini, red onion, mushrooms, but then seasoned as per the recipe-they were a great addition to the meal-thanks for sharing.

I made it last night using the squashes and other vegetables I had.  I think it's always tastier to use fresh herbs, which when using you need to use 3 times as much as dried, and it was great.  I roasted it for 40 minutes in a 375 degree convection oven on two 1/2 sheet pans.  This morning I picked out the potatoes to slice and fry to eat with eggs.  Yummy!
