I seasoned my chicken with salt free poultry rub.  Omitted mushrooms and re-used some pans but otherwise followed everything to the letter. Very decent dish...could do with a dash of sherry and a deglazing of wine in the pan after frying the chicken.

This was the best ever! I used spaghetti noodles instead. I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. Yummy!

I followed this recipe to a "T" for the sauce portion. I personally found it kind of bland, I would experiment with other spices. However, my husband LOVED it as it was. I would make this again.

First I sliced up the raw chicken and put in a bowl.  I added basil, garlic salt, pepper and Thyme and tossed it good.  Then I cooked the chicken like the recipe stated.  I also used Angel Hair pasta.  At the end prior to serving I added parmesan cheese and tossed it a little.  Great with garlic toast too.

This was okay the first time I tried it. I had followed the recipe. But it was kind of watery and I couldn't really taste the garlic. The second time I pounded the chicken and seasoned it with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and thyme. I increased the rue by 2 tbs and only uses 2 cups of milk. I all so used more garlic. And I added 2 tablespoons of Basil for color and flavor. And it was much better! I'd give it 4 stars with a little tweaking!

Great recipe! But....I added extra onions & just before it was time to put the chicken in with it, I added leftover green beans, peas, corn & carrots. Added nice color, too. When I put the chicken in the pan, I sprinkled seasoned salt on each piece....along with garlic powder. When I added the garlic to the sauce, I also added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese & onion powder (1 1/2 tsp) & seasoned salt to the sauce & stirred until it was well blended. Then, I put the chicken (already covered in sauce) to the side, & dumped the rest of everything into a 9x13 glass dish. I pressed the pieces of chicken all along the top, so we could find them, lol. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese, then topped with breadcrumbs....drizzling 1/4 cup of melted butter (the MELTED butter measured out to 1/4 cup...). Then baked for about 25 minutes @ 350*. AWESOME!!!!

Sauce could use an additional herb or something but overall, not too shabby.

When I read the recipe, I decided the missing flavor was tarragon. I added about a teaspoon of dried tarragon close to the end of cooking the chicken. Other than using half a bag of frozen onion instead of fresh, kept the rest as per the recipe. It was delicious!

Made the recipe pretty much exact with a few tweaks. Used fresh grape tomatoes instead of the mushroom, and added some fresh baby spinach near the end. Also added some italian seasoning and salt/pepper to the chicken while it was cooking.  Absolutely delicious! This will definitely be a staple dish for my fianc√© and I.

I served fresh, seared scallops on top, adding crushed red pepper to spice it up.  It was incredibly delicious and decadent.  It is not a low calorie dinner but a fabulous comfort meal that got raves from everyone.  It would be great with chicken, shrimp, sausage or salmon.

This was good. We were out of mushrooms, but will definitely use them next time. We added a good bit more garlic, and would probably add more next time. We added spinach, which was very good. Oh, and we also added parmesan cheese.

I made this for dinner tonight with a few of my own twists. My family LOVES it. This will most definitely be a staple in our house.                                                                                                            *My twists: (1)Grill mates zesty herb marinade added to the butter and flour. (2) Elbow noodles (It's all I had) (3) Topped each serving with a little shredded romano cheese.

I marinated my chicken in Goya Mojo, seasoned it well with Goya seasoning then backed it so it can be soft.  I also stuffed the chicken breast with spinach and mozzarella cheese. I then cut the the chicken in cubes. Well seasoned and much better tasting instead of just salt and pepper.

as other said before me, I seasoned the chicken (thyme, rosemary, salt&pepper) and it was really good, adding it to my repetoir for easy weekday dinners.

I omitted the mushrooms and added a seasoning called "Sandwich Sprinkle" by Penzey's).  My 11-yr old said it is the best ever.  So I have something he'll like to eat.  I have three other kids and they liked it too.  It's a win-win dinner!

I followed another rater's thoughts and added more seasonings, and flatened out the chicken before cooking.  I also only used 2 cups of milk, the rue consistency was perfect!  I would still add even more seasonings; thyme, poultry seasoning, garlic, basil, salt, pepper to recipe next time around.  My family of 5, with 3 being under 12, all loved it!  That, in its' self, is a feat!

Good simple recipe.  I made turkey meatballs and used Pennine instead of farfalle .  Added fresh basil.

I like to use chicken tenderloins (2 pkgs). I also add peas and scallions for color. My kids love it!
