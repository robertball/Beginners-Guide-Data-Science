Love this! The miso makes a great glaze. I never had barramundi before, but I'll definitely be having it again.

I made this dish for a group of people who aren't crazy about fish.  They absolutely loved it, and I'm sharing the recipe.  It took very little time, and is so easy.  It's a new family favorite.

This is absolutely delicious. Don't change a thing. Bought the Barramundi at Costco - much more affordable than Sea Bass. The glaze is wonderful. Making this again tonight.

Another great recipe from Chef John.  Any light white fish will work here. Paired with Miso Sesame Dressing (from this site) was an excellent meal.

WOW!!!  love this!!!!!!.this will be a regular meal for me. I made it according to recipe with no subs.
I made a spring mix salad and threw some green onions and cucumbers and skinny girl raspberry vinegarette  and it was EXCELLENT.  This fish has a beefier texture, but it holds up really well to this mix.  You won't have any crumbs left.  My cats came running when they smelled it.   ;-)

I thought this was delicious and the whole family ate every bite even, my two young kids.   It reminded me of the miso-glazed sea bass at Stir Crazy.  I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so i had to substitute for apple cider vinegar and it still turned out well.  Next time I will try to figure out how to make the sauce a bit thicker as it was the consistency of soy sauce and vinegar.  The miso paste wasn't as thick as I was expecting.
