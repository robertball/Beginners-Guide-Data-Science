I must preface this review by saying that my mother-in-law always asks me to bring a lettuce salad to family dinners because I assume that she thinks it's the only thing I can make,which by the way, is simply not true.  So after trying this recipe at a bridal shower, I called her up and told her that this is what I was bringing to Christmas.  She reluctantly agreed.  When we arrived for Christmas dinner I saw that my mother-in-law had made a cheeseball her self and had it sitting out on the table.  UUUGGGHHH!  I refused to give up, so I sat my cheeseball right down next to her's.  By the end of the night everyone was raving about MY cheeseball and had scraped the plate clean.  Her cheeseball, however, only had a couple of bites taken out of it.  She ended up wrapping her's up and putting it back in the fridge!!  HA HA!! Victory is mine!!!  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe and the small gratification I got from making it.  I added a little garlic powder and onion powder and I usually use about 4 green onions.  This is the best cheeseball ever!!!

Kelli - thanks for a wonderful recipe.  This went over very big at my dinner party last night.  I did make a few twists on it to make it my own.  Very finely chopped scallions and fresh chives.  I also added in about 1/2 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese and I put my pecans in my food processor to make them smaller.  When I rolled my perfectly round cheese ball in the crushed pecans it really looked fabulous. I topped the ball with remaining scallions.  Oh good tip for any of you that have G. Foreman Grills - cooks your bacon in half the time and drains off alot of the fat & grease.  To crumble your bacon nicely, break it up and put it in a zip lock bag and crush up with a rolling pin.

This has been very popular at a couple of my parties. I enjoyed it but found the cheese ball to be slightly greasy due to the amount of bacon used (its definitely not a healthy party snack). I made a couple changes: I added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. onion powder. I served the cheese ball with crackers. I plan on making this for any more parties I have.

I made this twice, once for Thanksgiving and then again the next day. The only thing I did different and was more green onions and bacon.  Both are my weakness.  This was so easy, and I sent this recipe to a few of my friends.  My family loved it.  Will do again and again, and again.

I halved the recipe & added a couple of tbp of worcestershire as well as about a 1/4 cup of a finely shredded colby/monterey jack blend. I also added garlic powder & onion powder....I thought it was pretty bland before the additions. I wasn't wow'ed by the recipe on teh night I served it (made it the same day) but when we had some the next night, it was excellent. So definitely give the flavors some time to get to know one another. ;o) Oh, I also used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon...it's easier & leaner. Thansk for the yummy cheesball recipe Kelli Tabor!

Best cheeseball I ever made!  Had it at a baby shower, and everyone wanted the recipe!!!  I used a pouch of Hormel real bacon pieces and that made it so much easier.  Also added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. Great recipe!

This is REALLY good.  The only problem my husband and I have with it is that it's hard for us to keep in mind is that half of it is NOT considered one serving.

Loved this recipe.  I usually like anything with bacon (I know, I know) and this was no exception.  I did follow other's suggestions and added some garlic and onion powders.  I also added about 1/2 c. of cheddar.  Left off the pecans though.  This is great on everything from crackers to raw veggies.

I added 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder, and some worchestershire sauce. I also used the real bacon pieces from a jar instead of cooking the bacon. I divided into two smaller cheese balls. It is an easy recipe that goes together quickly and is a crowd pleaser.

This is a very nice cheese ball.  I only made 1/2 the recipe and it was plenty for an average size ball.  I also used 3 green onions and used walnuts as that is what I had on hand.  Yes pecans would be nicer.

I stuck to the recipe pretty much as is except I used an entire green onion. This was the first time I tried a cheese ball and it was so easy to make and a big success. Everyone raved about it and a couple of people went home with the recipe. Will definitely make it again. It will be a party staple for me. I also love the fact it does not take a lot of ingrediants.

I added garlic powder and cheddar cheese and only made 1 ball - DH said it could have used a lot more cheddar cheese or another type of cheese along with the cream cheese.

I used 2 3o. packages of the real bacon bits. I used 4 green onions and 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder. Also added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I made 2 balls and rolled each in the chopped pecans. Great!

It was good - but not the first thing that everyone went for.  Flavor is good, I drained the bacon well, so it wasn't greasy or oily - but very salty.

Excellent and easy, but needs more green onions, IMO.  Will use 3-4 next time rather than just 1.  Will also add in a couple of dashes of garlic powder.

I've made the recipe several times and always get rave reviews about it. Any time we have a family or friend get together I'm always told I'm in charge of bringing the bacon/cheese ball. Everyone just loves it. I like some of the other users increase the onion a bit and I do not roll my cheese ball in chopped nuts...instead I mix some shredded marble cheese with parsley flakes and roll in that. (This would be a good variation for those with nut allergies.)  

My husband uses any left overs (not that there usually is much) as a cream cheese spread on a toasted bagel which is also quite good.

This is by far the best cheeseball I've had. It is also very, very easy to prepare.

Thanks for sharing your great recipe with us!

I made this and divided into 2 cheese balls for 2 parties. Both times they were devoured. Everyone loved it. Don't skimp on the bacon. That's what makes it so good.

I was invited to a last-minute gettogether and needed something I could make with stuff from my pantry.  I had to change a few things, but was so thankful to enter "bacon and cream cheese" into the ingredients search and come up with something similar... I used less bacon, whipped cream cheese, a few slices of american cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, hot sauce and then rolled in crushed smoked almonds.  All done in seconds in the food processor.  Yummy.. Thanks for the basis for this.We'll see how it goes over tomorrow.. Lifesaver! :)

This is the perfect cheeseball.  I did add a bit of season salt and Beau Monde seasoning, otherwise followed the directions.  I used walnuts (I prefer them) and it's perfect.

Very good! Absolutely delish. I did switch the bacon for some chopped green olives, as I'm vegetarian, but it was still very yummy!

This is pretty good. I used more green onions than called for and would recommend throwing the chopped pecans in the food processor for a pulse or two.

I usually make this as an igloo and pair it with the olive penguins as a special request from my daughters.  The appearance appeals to children and the flavor appeals to adults.

Now I know how this got such good reviews. Due to the reccession I decided to try and make most of my Christmas Eve get together to save on money. This cheese ball was one of them. I have to tell you my DH had to lick the bowl clean, worse than a kid with a cake bowl, and wouldn't save any for anyone else. I just finished the pecan topping, and what a beautiful presentation it makes.  This is the first time I am having an  after service get together and I know with recipes like this it will be a success, and hopefully a tradition that goes on. Thanks so much for posting

i cut this recipe in half and it was still a huge cheeseball! I used 3 oz bacon bits instead of bacon, and added half cup of shredded cheese and 1 tsp garlic powder. Next time I will probably up the shredded cheese to one cup, just because I love the flavor and texture of it.

This was a good cheeseball but it was incredibly salty. I generally don't like very salty foods but overall it was still good. Hubby loved it but he adds salt to everything! I used Ritz crackers which were perfect for it in my opinion.

Used real bacon pieces, sour cream, and dried parsley rather than bacon, mayo, and pecans.

This cheeseball is always a hit.  If you find it too greasy from the bacon I suggest using turkey bacon.  If you bake the bacon in the over rather than frying it in a pan and cut it with kitchen shears it turns out great.
I've made this with both regular bacon and with turkey bacon and everyone agrees turkey bacon is the way to go.

This cheese ball is good. The bacon can make it a bit salty for those who are not crazy about salt. I have made it many times even without the bacon and it is still good. I mostly have to leave out the mayo as I really don't find it to be necessary, and like to save on calories whenever I can!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday party, and it was a big hit - I've already passed the recipe on. I made small changes as others suggested, adding cheddar cheese and garlic powder. The only negative thing I would have to say about it is that it makes ALOT! I didn't use the full amount of cream cheese or bacon, and I made 1 gigantic "ball". My friends called it a cheese football! I will definitely make it again, although only half the recipe. Thanks!

Easy and excellent! I've made it for the past two Thanksgiving dinners. Only thing I do differently to save time is using a jar of real bacon bits instead of frying up my own.

I liked the bacon, green onion and pecan flavor but would use a different kind of cheese next time. Cream cheese just washes everything out and make it bland.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I make it for all of our "get togethers" and have been asked for the recipe every time.  I will admit though I do cheat and use store bought real bacon bits (i.e. ready crisps) as it's easier and I don't use as much as is recommended but it turns out great!

This is a very good base recipie.  Was missing a little bit of salt and heat, in my opinion.  But I can take care of that next time.  I will definitely be making this again.  LOVE the bacon and nutmeg.

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out absolutely delicious. To make frying the bacon easier I cut the bacon in real small pieces with kitchen shears prior to frying. I made this recipe for a funeral dinner and it went over very well. This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for such a great simple recipe. I will be making this again.

I thought this really needed some extra flavor. I was short some on the bacon, but added a couple good pinches of garlic salt and about a Tblsp. of pimientos. I put it in a wreath shape, without the pecans, and just sprinkled the shape with dried parsley and then added a bow made from cut-outs of a red pepper.

This is such a great party pleaser! I have made these 4 times in the past 2 weeks! I will say that in making it I did read some of the other reviews and made some changes. 1. I added 1/2 shredded cheese (I add what I have laying around the house) 2. I add onion salt and garlic powder about 1TBS each instead of the scallions 3. I most definitely used real bacon, it turns out great, just make sure you let the bacon cool and free up from excess grease, it is perfect. 4. I also added about a 1 TBS of Worcestershire 5. Lastly I did not add the pecans. All in all, it super easy to make and will please any crowd!

This cheese ball is addictive, so far the best one out there. I didn't have green onion so I used yellow onion, and I added Tabasco. I love it......Thanks for the recipe.

Thanksgiving 2009 - extra-good flavor, was well-liked by all. Changes: used prepared bacon bits, garlic powder, dried chives, MK chicken seasoning, finely chopped pecans.

While I was making this I had fingers constantly in the bowl just getting 1 more taste test.  Great flavor.  I mixed bacon in & coated the outside with more & shredded cheddar cheese.

This was awesome, however, I added my own little touch. I added two diced jalapenos, ranch mix and 86'd the nuts. This went over very well!! My dad made it for his work party and everyone loved it as well :)

Took this to Christmas dinner as an igloo with the cream cheese penguins.  People couldn't stop eating it and wanted the recipe.  It's a keeper and I normally am not a fan of cheese balls.  I did mix some pecans in with it and didn't coat the outside since I was trying to make it look like an igloo.

Makes a very large cheeseball. Like other reviewers, I added some garlic and onion powder. I omitted the green onions only because I forgot to buy them. I used approx. 3/4 lb of bacon and it was plenty in my opinion. 

I took it to a party and to be honest, it wasn't that big a hit. People seem to prefer the shrimp tray and a dip - main ingredients were corn and mayo - served with fritos.

Tastes VERY good, and very easy to make!  I use the already made REAL Bacon in a bag (NOT the fake Bacos stuff)and find it's less greasy but still has a great Bacon taste.  Also, I chop up some jarred Jalapenos (the kind for Nachos) and add it to the mix.  This gives it a lil kick!  YUM.

This title is very adequate. Yummy is a great word to describe this cheese ball. I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out great! I hadn't had a cheese ball since I was a child, but I am glad I found this great recipe. It tasted so amazing! The left overs are still a hit around the house.

I made this for a super bowl party and it was very popular. The only changes I made was that I cooked the bacon in the microwave on paper towels to reduce the fat. The other thing is that I added chili powder to give it a little zing.

Fabulous recipe!  My family and friends loved it, and were shocked to know that I was the one that made it (since I'm not a very good cook).  It was REALLY simple to put together.

I made this cheese ball for an open house, and to take to work. Everyone raved about it in both places. I added 1 tsp garlic powder, as another had mentioned, and left the onion out due to friend's taste preferences.

I have made this recipe for the past two Thanksgivings and it has been a real hit!  I make one ball with extra green onions and add some green pepper to it as well.  I have to leave one ball without green onions and pepper as the hubby will not eat anything "good for him!"  Highly recommend this...I have people asking me for the recipe each time I make it!

WOW very good.  The bacon and green onion are a great combination for this cheese ball.  I actually left off the nuts because I felt the bacon chunks would make it chunky and rich enough.  Very good, I would make again.

This was delisious!! I made it for our Christmas party and it was a big success.  I didn't form into a ball, just served it from a bowl, and didn't do the nuts since one guest had a nut allergy.  But WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN! THANKS!

This is by far one of the best cheeseball recipes I have tried or tasted! It became an instant hit at my office. I know it will become a pitch in classic and request. Everyone who tried it liked it, and wanted the recipe. One hint, I put the bacon in the oven rather than frying it. It worked really well. You cant go wrong with this recipe.

I thought this recipe was just okay, but I received many compliments on it when served at my superbowl party. I did cut back slightly on the bacon, and added onion and garlic powder as others suggested. I used sour cream instead of mayo.

Great cheese ball.  I prefer the pecans finely chopped.  Cook the bacon slightly longer so it's nice and crispy and easy to crumble.

I changed this a little out of pure laziness. I doubled the recipe, but did not double the bacon, and I added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to it. It was delicious!

This was my first cheese ball and I made this for a small get together I was having.  Everyone devoured the entire thing!  I left the pecans off just because I didn't have any at the time, but next time I will be adding them to it!

So easy and delicious!  Was a big hit at an office event.  Just left out green onion because I had none and added some garlic powder.

This was so good.  I added some cheddar cheese to it and did not add the green onion since not a lot of people in the fam like it.  It was good.  We will have this again.

Very easy to make. I was planning on making my usual cheese ball with dried beef instead of the bacon. However....I didn't realize I was out of dried beef. I did an ingredient search and found this one! I was so happy, and I think I like it better than the other one!

This was good! I too added some garlic and onion powders and used the bacon bits from the salad dressing aisle to save time. That may help with the greasiness some reviewers are experiencing. I served with beer bread cubes.

I took this cheese ball to my daughters graduation party and everyone loved it! The only changes I made was instead of frying a pound of bacon I used two packs of Oscar Mayer Ready to Serve Real Bacon Bits for salads, this worked perfect.

A friend made this, and I liked it so much that she told me I could find the recipe on this site. I used toasted almonds instead of pecans, but didn't let it all sit overnight--I think it would have had better flavor if I had.

Absolutely delicious and one of the simplest cheese balls I've ever made (and believe me, I've made a bunch during my 60 years of life!).  I'm having a small dinner party tomorrow and I know everyone will love it.  Thanks for posting it!

This is a good basic cheese ball recipe. I used the REAL bacon bits for salad topping, and they worked great- lots easier, and no greasiness.

To me, this was just alright. It didn't really have any zesty flavor to it. It was a little bland, even with all the bacon.

Made this for a family get-together & my gang rated it 5 star. I halved it, subbed bacon bits for the bacon, didn't have green onion, so I used reconstituted dried onion flakes, and it was still great! Served it with crackers and discovered it was also delicious with pretzels.

absolutely the best and eisiest cheese ball ever!!!  It has become a much requested favourite at church and family get-togethers.  My husband asks me to make him one just to snack on at home.  He thinks its so good that it doesn't need a special occasion to enjoy.

I don't know why, but this just wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.  I didn't think it had much flavor other than the garlic and onion powders I added at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I also added the cheddar cheese and I just didn't like it all that well.  My boyfriend did though.  I might try it again.  Maybe I just goofed something up.  Not sure.

I made this for super bowl sunday and its was not bad at all everyone seemed to like it.  After everyting was mixed there was not any way for me to form this into two balls unless I wanted two extreme mini cheeses balls.  So I put the mixture on the serving plate used my offset spreader and shaped it into one ball then I sprinkled chopped flat leaf parsley around the place along with some paprika (for presentation only) I skipped the chopped pecans all together as my nieces wouldn't have touched with the nuts.

I took this to our family Christmas get-together.  I did get to bring a little home but not much.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I will make it again but next time I will make sure I purchase the 16 ounce pkg. of bacon instead of the 12 ounce (if they still make the full pound size).  It really does need the full pound.  Also, I think I will add 2, maybe 3, green onions next time.  But it is good and a recipe worth saving.  By the way, I served two cheese balls, one rolled in chopped pecans and the other rolled in chopped walnuts.

We had a beach party pot luck @ work today and these were a hit. I added extra, extra onions that is the way I like it, but I did hear a few people say ohhh my breath.. Oh well. It was well worth it.. Thanks Kelli...=)

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was very good. I used real bacon bits to save time and I also used 2 green onions instead of one.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  I made the cheese ball into a "turkey", an idea I got from Pinterest by using pretzel sticks for tail feathers and and a beef stick with paper eyes and a pepper piece super glued on it.  It was cute!

This was very good.  I did do as the others suggested and added onion powder and garlic powder.  I also used the pre-made bacon bits.

Made with extra green onion and added a teaspoon of garlic powder.  Took to work for a party, got many compliments and request for the recipe. I made one big ball, it was all gone at end of the day.

Very tasty cheese ball - my first ever.  I added some onion powder and a chunk of fresh garlic.  I only made one ball because two would have been very small.  Surrounded with club crackers, I'm watching people eat it right now from my desk at work and they seem to really like it!  The chopped pecans make it look gourmet.

This is a 4.5 recipe. We all loved it but I did have to add some onion and garlic powder to suit us. I cheated and used a pouch of bacon pieces. I added in about a half a cup of finely shredded cheddar cheese for color. Thanks :-)

I made this for a party recently.  It was amazing!  Everybody wanted the recipe.  I did modify it a little...I added 3 green onions finely diced & rolled the cheese ball in slivered almonds.  So good & a keeper for sure.  Thankyou!!

Simple and fun to make.  Guests liked it.  For me it was kind of "meh."  Need to try it with bagel chips instead of Ritz crackers.

Everyone liked this cheeseball! I followed the recipe for the most part, adding 1/4 tsp each of onion powder & garlic powder and using 3 green onions.  I didn't have pecans so used crushed almonds. The longer it sits the better it gets. Yummy!!

I love this recipe!!! It’s always a favorite at gatherings; there’s usually a small group huddled around it until it is gone! I make it exactly as the recipe says, although I’m not sure if one green onion means only one stalk or one bunch (like it’s sold in stores). I use one bunch, so there’s generally 5 or 6 stalks and I think it comes out perfect, but I also love onions. I usually pair this with buttered crackers. This is a must try recipe!

Wonderful cheese ball.   It is a good as is or can add other ingredients for different taste
I too added about 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, a tsp garlic salt and a bit of onion powder.   I decorated with parsley as some of my guests had peanut allergies.
I was asked for the recipe and have made it twice since for other occasions.
Thank you again for a wonderful recipe.

A staple recipe for anytime! We don't use the pecans to roll it in and we don't use green onions. We do roll it in more shredded cheese.

I made this for an office party and got rave reviews.  I had several requests for the recipe.  I made 2 slight changes per the advice of other reviewers.  I added a couple dashes of garlic powder and used slivered almonds instead of pecans.  I also garnished the platter with fresh parsley.  This is a keeper!
