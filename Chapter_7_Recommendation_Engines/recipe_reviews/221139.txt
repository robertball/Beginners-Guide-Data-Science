EXCELLENT! If I could give these more stars, I would! I marinated my chicken all day...PERFECT! I did not use any salt, and they didn't need it. Oh, and I used vidalia onion instead of red b/c that's what I had on hand. This is such a simple, fun recipe w/ delicious results...I will be making these often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Simple and delicious, used a good buttermilk ranch dressing, and thai chili paste, the chicken was so tender, and don't forget to spread the meat out so that the bacon gets evenly done! Great stuff!!!!

These were so good.  I did not have the chili paste so I put in Franks hot sauce.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  I will be making this again. Note: I used 2 t. of the hot sauce.  I will be adding more next time.

Slightly precook the bacon before assembling the skews to ensure a crispy (not chewy) skewer.

Definitely make your chicken pieces at least 1 inch.  We marinated ours over night and it turned out great.  My kids loved the flavor but said the best part was the bacon, at least I know that the bacon taste isn't lost.  Using thick cut was important for this.  The onion pieces helped keep the bacon on.   Thanks for the recipe.

Ridiculously easy and OH SO GOOD! I didn't have chile paste but I did have chili sauce (Sriracha) so I squeezed some in there and it worked great. I skipped the salt and pepper, not necessary. I loved them and my son loved them (he is REALLY picky). I don't have a grill but these worked very well stove-top on a grill pan I have. I'll be making these for Memorial Day and for game nights! Thanks, Chef John!

I tried these today & they were very good. The only thing different I would do is add more red onion on skewer for an added flavor.

Made this for a dinner party and despite regretting how much time it took to thread the skewers, it was well worth the effort. Everyone raved how fantastic they were. The flavours combined well and they were just as good as leftovers.
Note - I made them ahead of time and put them on a plate covered in plastic wrap in the fridge for 2 hours so I wasn't stuck in the kitchen while my guests arrived. 
BBQ trick - wrap your serving plate with plastic wrap before putting raw meat on it. Once you put your meat on the grill, remove the plastic wrap and your plate is now safely ready to put the cooked meat on!

I used the oven @ 400 for about 30 mins.  Turn once after 15.  I didnt have any chili paste so put some canned chipotle peppers in the processor and made a paste that way.  Worked great!  I will however, try it with chili paste someday and see which I like better.

The kabobs were delicious!  I doubled the amount of chile, just because I like it spicy.  I let them marinade for about 3 hours and they had the best flavor.  Added some extra veggies to half of them: mushrooms, bell peppers, tomatoes and zucchini.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I actually let it soak 2 days due to being out of town.  I expected huge ranch flavor.  There really wasn't any.  Chicken did cook tender though.  If I am supposed to rely on a dipping sauce, why bother marinating it in the same thing?  Weaving the bacon on the skewer was a different idea though.  I liked it, but it just didn't have the big flavor that was expected.

This recipe was delicious! Marinating the chicken in ranch made it very moist and tender and the bacon was a prefect compliment. I experimented by adding sweet potatoes to the skewers and it was fabulous! What a great grilling recipe to be used all summer long.

These were AWESOME ! I saw some people said it had no flavor..not sure what happened to their preporations, but i cut the breast up in 1"cubes and salt and peppered them heavy.. ..i could not find chile paste..i found chile sauce in the asian section at super market with Marzetti ranch in the jar for the marinade...i let them marinate for 3 hours ..you cut the chicken breast up in 1" cubes and stack on skewer with red onion and i used the thick bacon. Make sure you spread them out once you packed them on that skewer to help the bacon brown crispy..i made creole seasoned fried potatoes in a skillet and baked beans..this was for our Fathers Day cookout at home and ALL daddy's loved it..the chicken was so tender and yummy...will make again !

These were amazing. I made my own ranch using the packets, and didn't have any hot chile paste so I just poured Sriracha hot chile sauce into the ranch. The homeade ranch is thicker, so the sauce didn't thin it too much. Watching the video was really helpful in assembling these! My husband and I ate these for dinner, and then ate them cold for breakfast. Don't judge me till you've tried them, they're that good!

I've made this four times and it is a bit of work getting the chicken on the skewers, but boy is that chicken tender.  I have basically followed the recipe, but have used different condiments to make it hotter.I've marinated the chicken far longer than suggested and that's fine (but not necessary.)  DO NO USE REGULAR CUT BACON. For this to come out ok, use thick cut and you'll be fine.

Oh, my!  These disappeared so fast, I barely got a taste!  I used red curry paste, since that was all I had on hand, and I feared it might not mix well with the ranch dressing flavor. It was perfect!  I didn't pat the chicken dry after marinating them, but left all the marinade on.  The chicken was very moist and so flavorful!  They were very easy, too! Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good stuff.  Substituted some tabasco sauce, chili powder and crushed chili flakes for the chile paste, and vidalia onion for the red.  Didn't pat the chicken dry or use any additional s&p.  Also added a couple chunks of pineapple to each skewer.  Getting everything on the skewer is a little time consuming, but not terrible.  Had a little leftover chicken and onion that we cooked up in a pan and that tasted good as well.

I made this recipe for my family last night and everyone LOVED it!
The chicken was so tender. My son doesn't like ranch so I did some with BBQ sauce and he couldn't get enough. We will definitely be having these again. We ate it so fast that I didn't get a picture.-PJ422

We thought these were fantastic!  I just marinated the chicken in plain ranch dressing because we had some diners who were wary of spicy food.  Next time I will add the chile paste, but it was delicious without it as well.  Threading the bacon was a little time consuming, but the end result was worth it.  This is a fun and delicous recipe that we all enjoyed!

Awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out WONDERFUL!  Don't worry if you don't like ranch--- it does not taste like it when it is all done.  The bacon grease makes the chicken crispy and OH SO TASTY!!!!!!! Yummmmmmm. :-)

LOVED!!!!! And so did everyone. I used a low fat ranch dressing and used Sriacha sauce instead of the chili paste....marinated for several hours and yes a minor hassle to weave the bacon...etc...etc...but WHO CARES!!! This chicken is so flipping moist and amazing in flavor. Loved the bacon and red onion in between the layers....just so very good. Thanks Chef John!

Made these for my Memorial Day celebration. They were very good! I could not find the chile paste so I substituted with some hot sauce. I added green pepper and more red onion to my skewers! Great recipe...I will be making these again!

I didn't have ranch dressing so I used the Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip recipe (here on AR) and sprinkled that all over the chicken.  I've made them straight after seasoning and also letting them set for a few hours.  Great both ways.  I couldn't picture how to do the bacon, so the video was very helpful.  This has become a must-have when we have friends over, they all ask for it.

Excellent!  Marinated Chix tenders cut in pieces in zip lock bag for 3 hours.  Cooked thick sliced bacon in microwave for 3 minutes before threading onto skewers.  Added large mushrooms to skewers. Yum!

As it was just for the 2 of us I chose not to put everything on skewers; rather I fried the bacon and then added everything else to the frying pan. As the picture showed zucchini I added it but not the mushrooms. It all came together quickly.
We both enjoyed it and I'd make it again.

DISASTER!!  Not, the recipe, but my execution.  Less expensive boneless chicken thighs and fat free Ranch work great.  After a 1 hour marinade, I cut open the packages of bacon that I bought on sale so I could begin assembly, and HOLY COW, the bacon pieces were sliced anywhere from 1/4" thick to paper thin in each pack.  There is no way any of these skewers would cook the same way with such extremes in thickness.  I envisioned disaster.  So, if this happens to you, here is a work-around:

Stick to Chef John's recipe, adjusting the amount of spice to your taste.  The buttermilk in the Ranch will make the chicken tender, even thigh meat, after only 1 hour.

Cook your bacon to your preferred likeness. Save a bit of the grease and set aside.  Cut/rip the bacon into pieces and set aside. Prepare your side dishes now because the next step is fast.

Put just enough bacon grease into a large frying pan to coat the bottom and dump in the chicken, marinade and all.  Simmer until the chicken is done (no pink) but not tough, maybe 5 minutes or so.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a large bowl, add your cooked bacon, and mix to heat, but keep the marinade simmering on the stove until it reaches a nice gravy thickness.  Add that to the chicken/bacon mixture and serve hot.

I would have loved the kabob presentation, but this was just a yummy and probably quicker than using skewers.  I served with scalloped potatoes and steamed veggies - HUGE hit.  Thanks Chef John!

I didn't bother with the skewers I just wrapped each piece of chicken with some bacon, and used chipotle ranch dressing for this recipe. I baked them on a broiler pan and they turned out great.   It is the only recipe my daughter wants to learn how to make.

The only thing that had flavour for us was the bacon, but it did not cook enough before the chicken was done.  It was soft and chewy.  I agree with another review that the bacon should be partially cooked beforehand to give it a crisp taste.

Although I loved the concept of chicken, ranch dressing and bacon...I didn't think the taste was as bold as it should have been.  Could it have been the ranch dressing?  I bought thick sliced Applewood bacon, and the chicken breast.  Followed instructions precisely and even watched the video.  I agree it was easy...maybe marination period should have been longer?

Great recipe. I cut my chicken into strips and wrapped it around 1/2 of a pepperoncini then wrapped this in bacon and put it on the skewers. I also added mushroom halves, pineapple slice quarters and red bell pepper chunks to the skewer.

This is as easy and finger-licking good as it seems.  I would only add that two skewers would help you turn the skewers.  Otherwise it's a sure-fire hit

Nice change doing chicken with bacon. The success to this recipe is to slightly precook the bacon. No one likes half cooked bacon. Additional spices like garlic, paprika, etc.  are needed for more flavor.

Trying to grill it long enough to crisp the bacon but not dry out the chicken was difficult. Ended up with very dry chicken and under cooked bacon in the end. I don't think I will make this again.

These were delicious and easy...just a lil' bit time consuming getting the meat and veggies on skewers. I would use thinner bacon next time and really loosen up the chicken and bacon on the skewer...I didn't care for the soft bacon...prefer mine more well done. The chicken was awesome though!

These were very good.  Per other poster's comments, I too would add more onion than the small piece at each end as Chef John demonstrates.  The onion gets nice and sweet and really balances out the saltiness of the ranch and bacon.  I might even try a Vidalia onion next time.  And, of course this is a matter of preference, but I'd highly discourage any added salt.  Maybe some pepper, but it's plenty salty as is.  Thanks Chef John.  Another winner!

These were great!  I used bones, skinless chicken thighs. Didn't have any paste on hand. I also added fresh pineapple chunks to the mix. I only had thin bacon and that was too bad as some of the bacon broke apart in spots. Next time I'll use thick cut. Kids helped me assemble them so we had an art project we could eat while camping. Thank you!

Make these with a quality thick-sliced bacon and you definitely will not be disappointed. The family gobbled these up and raved about them. I large amount of the flavor comes from the bacon so you'll definitely not want to skimp with a cheap or less flavorful variety here -- use quality ingredients and you'll definitely like the outcome.

We'll definitely be making these again. It was great to have a different, yet scrumptiously delicious, option to grill. Thanks Chef John!

My husband LOVED this. I marinated it in southwest ranch and pepper flakes and used turkey bacon (he doesn't even like turkey bacon) He said it was the BEST kabob he's ever had! I also added green peppers to the ends w/ the onion. I made a blander version for the kids and me, and it was pretty good also.

My family loved this recipe and it was really good!  I made my own Ranch from scratch and didn't need to blot with paper towels; it was very tender and juicy.  Will def make again!  Mixed sambal with ranch at table for the dip, too!  Thank you!

Made this recipe recently and it came out perfect.
I used thick cut double smoked bacon and next time I might use extra red onion threaded throughout the Kebab.

I felt there was significant flavor lacking in this recipe.  I let my chicken marinate for several hours and followed this recipe to the letter.  While the chicken was tender, there was just not much flavor other than the bacon and the salt and pepper I added.  The method of skewering the bacon was appreciated, though.  Thanks for sharing, Chef John!

You MUST precook the bacon, a bit, and render some of the fat, just to make it soft. You'll have raw bacon otherwise. Seasoning's pretty good, otherwise.

Thumbs way up for this recipe!  It reminds me of another grilled ranch chicken recipe but the addition of the hot chili sauce to my homemade buttermilk ranch dressing for the marinade and the combo of red onion and bacon took them over the top flavor wise.  Even with the clear directions it took some time to skewer the chicken with the bacon and onion but it was time well spent.  Great!

This elegantly simple recipe is a super easy way of cooking chicken on the barbeque. As it cooks, the juices from the bacon melt into the chicken, keeping it from drying out and giving you a lot of latitude in heat and cooking time. Beginning chefs or hardcore BBQrs both will get rave reviews from everyone around the table, guaranteed.

This sounded great, but I was disappointed with the lack of taste. Maybe I should have used regular ranch instead of "light". I marinated the chicken for 2.5 hrs.

Yummy! Made exactly according to directions, other than I marinated the chicken for a bit longer.  It was perfect! Tasty and delicious.  Chicken was super tender.  Slightly salty bacon provided a nice contrast to the sweeter ranch flavors.  Would maybe add a bit more seasonings next time.  Would definitely make again!  4 and 6 year olds loved it as well!

These were amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly except reduced the chili paste cause I had guests who don't like spicy food.  They were so tender and juicy. Next time I'll add  more spice. We ate them for dinner with grilled veggies and it was a wonderful meal.  This will be a go to recipe for me.

Outstanding, the buttemilk in the ranch dressing tenderizes so well. Made them for a party and everyone loved them. I think next time I will add fresh seeded jalepenos to the skewer. mmmmmmm

Made these a few times and they’re always amazing. Never any left-overs. The ranch mix helps tenderize the chicken perfectly. I like red bell peppers instead of the onion as a personal preference.

I thought that these were good, but not GREAT.  I thought they were a little on  the bland side, so I'll probably dress them up with more herbs and spices next time.
I followed one reviewer's advice and partially cooked the bacon before threading, and I will definitely do that again next time.

I made this recipe for my family and they really liked it. Although marinating the chicken in ranch (I did two days) did not make it have that much of a ranch flavor, it does make the chicken pieces nice and moist so that they grill well.

Did put anything spicy and used mini potatoes instead of onions.  I also baked them instead of putting them on the grill.  380 degrees, 10 minutes on each side - perfect!!!

Chicken was excellent. Bacon didn't get crisp but might have been my fault.  The chicken was so good that I'm glad I didn't cook it long enough to fully cook the bacon since the chicken might have been over done.

Possibly a grilling rookie, but the avocado oil spray on the veggie only skewers alongside the chicken kabob's began to wreak havoc on smoke and fire for the chicken. Make sure you separate them on the grill to avoid this mistake.

The food was excellent! Just don't try to veggie these up. Use a different skewer to handle this.

This was super easy and delicious.  I made the ranch dressing myself and used buttermilk in it since that’s always good for a chicken marinade.  I didn’t have bamboo skewers on hand so I used my metal ones.  The chicken was slippery due to the marinade and bacon so it was hard to turn on the grill. I’ll definitely use bamboo the next time for grilling ease.  I didn’t change the recipe a bit.  Served it with a simple mushroom risotto.  It was a huge hit.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I omitted the bacon, but am sure it would be delicious if added.  They are delicious without, and it was a personal choice.  I have marinated them, returned them to the freezer, and defrosted when ready to  cook, for the convenience.
They are wonderfully moist.

My family loved this! I didn't have any skewers, so I cooked everything in a skillet.  I cooked the thick cut bacon first, then cooked the chicken in about 2 tablespoons of the drippings. I used Sriracha sauce because that's what I had on hand and I omitted the salt and pepper, it wasn't necessary. We used the extra buttermilk ranch dressing I made for the recipe as a dip for the chicken.  I served it with fresh corn and butter beans. Next time I think I'll serve it over a salad as a meal.

Tastes delicious! It's creamy and slightly spicy. Also coated tomatoes, mushrooms and yams with the marinade. Next time I'll prep the veggies sooner so that now flavor will get in.

this is a real crowd pleaser!  I've always left the hot sauce or bc my daughter doesn't like "spicy" but it doesn't suffer for it. 

I've made this multiple times and can say that a time saving and flavorful alternate prep is to just make the skewers and then drench them in ranch.  Avacado ranch is good too.

My Hubby said it was ok.  I used Ranch with bacon,  and on some skewers add mini tomatoes, mini red onions, zicchini, different colored peppers and mushrooms.

I didn't use the bacon, which I had purchased, because as I was skewering it seemed like the bacon would be too much. Mistake. The bacon was needed for salt and added flavor. Next time - bacon! The skewers were good but not exceptional without the bacon.   >> Updated review and rating. I used the bacon this time and added 1/8 tsp salt to the ranch dressing mixture. Very nice.  Increased my rating from a 3 to a 4.

Followed recipe exactly.  Easy to prepare and tasted good, but flavor wasn't as strong as we thought it would be.  Would still make again, maybe adding a bit more chili paste for more flavor.

Great flavor, the only thing I would mention is that the union should only be a few slices together, I put the entire section and it was too dense to cook all the way through. 

It's a keeper.

Fantastic!! I didn't have the paste, so I used so of our friend's homemade tabasco sauce and added it to the ranch. I also seasoned the chicken with a garlic and herb seasoning. Marinated for four hours.  I followed other reviews, and cooked the bacon a little before hitting the grill. Great spring/summer receipe!

I used the ingredients, but skipped the skewers and made this in a skillet.  Added some garlic and served over rice.  Kiddos gobbled it up and said it was their new favorite, until they don't like it anymore;)

I made these and wasn't impressed. I love Chef John's recipes and this unfortunately wasn't a winner. Since I'm a big fan of his recipes I will try this again but I will most certainly have to change it up by adding flavor.

These were incredibly moist and delicious and i will make them again.  That being said I agree with the reviewers who thought there wasn't much ranch flavor.  I think next time I will have a dip with them.

We enjoyed these although I felt it needed more seasoning besides chile and black pepper. I used Sarah's Dry Rub For Chicken from this site to add a little more flavor and it paired well with the Ranch. Overall I'd make it again with my additions. Thanks Chef John. :o)

We loved these skewers! I used sriracha instead of the chile paste and cooked them in the oven (400 for about 20 minutes each side). Assembling them was really easy. They were a big hit with everyone at my house.

This is our new family fav! Relatively low carb, lots of flavor and tender chicken! Couldn't find hot chili paste so I chopped and mashed a chile in adobo sauce and it gave the recipe a lot of zing - yum! Plan on making it for the 4th!

Excellent!  I used extra thick bacon - but regular bacon would cook better.  Used red onion but Vidalia would be good also.  Didn't marinate in ranch - but did baste in it.  No hot ingredient added.

Loved the ranch-spicy marinade. My boys and friends ate these up! My husband and I noted that we would try skipping the bacon next time and add a bit of vegetable oil to the marinade. The bacon added great tenderness to the chicken but tasted more like fatback than crispy bacon so many if us left it on our plate. Great recipe!

Most wonderful!  Marinated for only 1 hour and used sriracha.  Grilled/smoked and precooked the bacon.  Added mushrooms to the skews.  Made a avocado/ranch dressing to serve with.  Also as sides used wild rice and cauliflower salad

This did not turn out at all like I expected. The flavor of the sauce was really bizarre. I wonder if it might be better with honey mustard instead of Dijon. The chicken recipe was actually delicious. I would suggest trying the sauce before applying it to the noodles. Might be better in moderation.

My family loved this! The chicken was so moist and flavorful marinated it in the buttermilk ranch for 3 hours I also used sweet chili sauce instead because my six year old daughter couldn't handle the hot and it was perfect! I have to say as for the bacon I used thin and it still took awhile to cook. So my next go around going to have space it better.

I did mine a little different because I did not have gas for my grill so I cooked the bacon removed it and drained the grease. Then I cooked the onion in the same pan then removed them. I then put my chicken with the ranch dressing and hot chili sauce in the pan and cooked on med until the chicken was done. I added the onions back in and toped with the bacon cut into bite size peices. It was outstanding. I will be making this again. It was easy and quick which is what I like on a work night. I had the leftovers today and it was just as good.

Made this for a party and it was a total flop.  The ranch burned on the grill and had no flavor even after marinading for 24 hours.  Luckily I still had some ranch and made a quick dip to disguise the flavor of the chicken and save the meal.

Chef John, 
I truly appreciate your videos.  They are well done, clearly show the steps of each recipe, and are full of humor.  Thank you for making me smile each time I get inspired by one of your cooking demonstrations.

Another GREAT Chef John dish. Perfect for a pot luck bbq, I made some with chicken and some with chopped lean pork loin and they were excellent, not a single piece left over :)

I didn't have ranch dressing so I used blue cheese and it was delicious.  We couldn't eat the bacon as it was undercooked between the chicken-I may try to spread it out more next time.  I added orange peppers and a little more onion to each of the skewers

Tasty and easy. The bacon did not crisp up enough to eat but added flavor. I will had more chile paste or some hot sauce next time around. All in all a good summer meal.

Using one half of a boneless breast I mixed chipotle sauce and ranch dressing, lightly seasoned the chicken chunks, mixed and marinated overnight. I wrapped bacon around each chunk and thread red bell pepper, red onion and the bacon wrapped chicken on skewers. I cooked them in the NuWave Oven; 9 minutes on 1 side, 4 minutes on the other side. I heated the marinade and brushed the food between turning. The bacon was cooked and the chicken was so tender. This was money!

Wow. Very easy, very tasty. Like many other reviewers, I used sriacha sauce -- about 2 tablespoons, may use more next time as the flavor was mild but tasty. Also added cut up green pepper. Delicious!!!!

Loved this enough that I was looking forward to leftovers, but there weren't any!  Only issue I had was the bacon didn't cook properly.  I did use the thick cut but suspect I didn't space everything out enough.  The marinade was terrific and made for some tasty, juicy chicken.  I'll do this again and may try both spacing kabobs out a little more to give the bacon more room to cook and maybe precooking the bacon slightly.

These were by far the best skewers I have ever had. We use Harvestland organic chicken in our house and it was so tender after marinating in the ranch mixture for 3 hours. I used Sriracha instead of chili paste and I cooked the bacon in the microwave for about 2 mins (1 min on each side) because we don't like chewy bacon at all! I added some red peppers and extra onions to the skewers. I made a side of ranch & Sriracha for us to dip the skewers in. We made 5 of them- for 2 people- and ate every one. They were delicious and I can't wait to make them again!!

Delicious!  I used Srirach Hot Chili Sauce.  The bacon was a perfect addition.  Makes me want to experiment more with bbq-ing chicken and making kabobs.

Fantastic. I used spicy salsa instead of chili paste and marinated over night. Served with jasmine rice and green beans and had smiles all around the table. The video was helpful and the wrapping kept everything nicely together. Deeeeeeeelish!

Very tasty! we skipped the hot chile paste on the first time through, as my teen and I are not into spicy foods. And we cooked them in a cast iron skillet since we have no bbq, but with more ranch for dipping they were awesome! Will be making again. PS- I also let them marinate for 2 days in Litehouse Ranch dressing and the meat was very tender and flavorful. Next time I will pull out the indoor grill and try some hot sauce in the marinade.

I just made this and LOVE it.  I too added a little extra onion just because I love onions off the BBQ.  I couldn't find any Chili Paste so I used Chili sauce.  Worked just fine!  I found that one large chicken breast made four skewers with five chunks of chicken on each and I had a few pieces left that I just threw on the BBQ too.  Thanks!  Great recipe.

Wonderful. Chicken came out so tender and tasty. I didn't have chilli paste so added about 1/2 tsp hot sauce. Gave it great flavor and no heat. Definitely on my summer cook out do again list.

Had this for supper, really great taste and tenderness. Only problem, the bacon didn't cook enough for me. Next time I will wrap it around the outside and see how that does.

Wow-- So few ingredients and yet what a super dish for family or company!  I watched the chef's video and learned a very helpful tip about how to thread the chicken and bacon on the skewers more efficiently--thanks Chef John!  I did not have chili paste--so WHO does, I wonder?--instead I added a wee bit of chipotle rub I had bought at a Pampered Chef party--1/4 to 1/2 tsp. just to give a kick like I assume the chili paste would have done.  Add what you'd like to give that bit of kick to the ranch marinade.  Also, I did not thread the onion on the skewers-did not necessarily need any more flavor and it was easier to thread just the chicken and bacon.  You might want to wear plastic gloves when threading--the hands get very messy during this process.  I have made this about 6-8 times and will continue to do so.  Fast and simple enough to make at the end of a work day, not just the weekend.  Company also loves it!

I didn't have hot chili paste so I added some tabasco... I marinated it over night. I also used turkey bacon and I made it on the George Foreman grill...
Came out perfect...  Will definitely make this again...

I certainly need to try this one again. I found the chicken dry but that could have been my own fault for overcooking. Nice and easy recipe though and a great little appetizer.

I made this a couple of nights ago and it was amazing.  Although, I did just cook the skewers without patting them dry and they turned out great.

We've made this a few times, usually for company because its an impressive dish.  The idea of weaving bacon around a skewer is great!  I'd like to advise leaving gaps between the meats on the skewer so that everything cooks well..

Super delicious!! So juicy and full of flavor. This recipe was a nice switch from the traditional meat and veggie kabobs. Will definitely make again.

Amazing! I marinated the chicken overnight and used Franks Red Hot sauce in place of the chile paste. I would suggest you use more chile paste or hot sauce if you like it spicy. I also omitted the salt. The chicken was so moist and tender, my family couldn't get enough! This will be a staple recipe in my house from now on!

I made these while camping at Hermit Island in Maine...the only problem was...I didn't make enough and didn't soak the skewers long enough.... so wonderfully delicious...the buttermilk in the ranch dressing is meant to make the chicken moist and tender with little ranch taste! Nice combination of flavors...I have made this twice this summer on a weber grill just have to turn them a lot to keep from burning...donot walk away for a second!!!!

These were very good.  I didn't have hot chili paste so I used Thai sweet chili sauce.  It took me a few tries to get the bacon threaded but once I got it things went smoothly.  My husband has requested that I make them again!  Thanks for the unique and delicious recipe.

The entire family enjoyed these skewers. The chicken and bacon were very flavorful. I didn't have chili paste so I used hot sauce. I will do these again. The kids have even offered to help with the skewering.

Delicious!  LOVED IT!!!!  Can't say enough good things.  I added quartered fresh mushrooms to the skewers too.  Didn't have thai chili paste so used Louisiana hot sauce.

Even my pickiest 8 year old scarfed 3 kabobs down...the one who "doesn't like Ranch!"  No salt needed, didn't pat them down with paper towels either.  Didn't add pepper or have chili paste...had sriracha instead as did another reviewer.   I would cook more onion with it for next time. 

So easy and so worth it!  The video is great as well for demonstration of how to thread the bacon on the skewer.
