I added some diced Roma tomatoes and passed on the mint. Thought about adding spinach but decided to try that another time lol. Everything was good though!

This was awesome and delicious. I followed the recipe, but I think I used a 1/4 cup less oil in the saut√© of asparagus and spinach.

It was much better than I expected. I had no way to chop it except by hand and it worked out fine.  Was generous with olive oil and seasonings...it really is lovely.
