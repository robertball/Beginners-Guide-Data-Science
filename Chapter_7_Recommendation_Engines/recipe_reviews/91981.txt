I found the sour cream taste to be overpowering..I would halve the amount next time. I would also add more corn. I used frozen vegetables cause I don't like the canned taste. I also found it a bit bland..so I added some fried onion rings into the actual mix. Everyone LOVED it!!!!

The ingredients sound great in theory, but we made this for Thanksgiving & not a single guest would have it again.  The sour cream was overpowering and the cheese formed a crust that was too chewy.  We did substitute whole fresh green beans for the canned and that was a mistake as well.  I guess while we were adventurous, we should've stuck with the tried and true - not twisted.

It was okay at first. I did read other reviews and I was told to half the sourcream and I did. However, the cream was still too much compared to the vegetables. So I ended up adding another can of green beans and corn to make it up, and THAT way it was DELICIOUS.

The idea was great but the sour cream was too much. It was too sloppy in my opinion and everyone said that all they could taste was the sour cream. I also felt it needed a little bit more flavor, like salt and pepper. But I would be willing to try it again just way less sour cream.

This was just OK.  We liked it with the corn, but it was missing something.  Salt and pepper helped.  I'll probably combine ideas from other similar recipes and try it again with the changes.

Maybe it's because I doubled the recipe, but this took FOREVER to cook, and by the time it was finally hot, the sour cream/ soup mixture just sat on top. I thought it would seep through, but it was like a really overpowering layer of cream, and then the beans and corn by themselves. Again, maybe if it were the original recipe amount, the sour cream would have seeped in. Seriously, no one touched it on Christmas, and I was stuck with a TON of it to take home, that ended up getting tossed.

We made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  The sour cream goes so well with the corn and green beans.  The beans were a bit soggy on the bottom so may try to mix the sour cream mix with the beans and corn next time.  Very tasty!

A wonderful surprise addition to this years holiday meals. Even my DH who hates green bean casserole with a passion asked for seconds. The tang of the sour cream gives it a nice little "punch" of flavor. I'll be adding it to more of our holiday meals.

This was a huge hit here. Everyone remarked how well they liked this dish. I used french cut green beans, canned corn and a blend of sharp cheddar and monteray jack cheese. My only addition was some freshly ground black pepper. Very good dish. Thanks!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  True comfort food.  The only thing I do differently is I use French Fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs.  YUMMO!

We didn't like this at all.  I used frozen beans and only 1 cup of sour cream. We don't like canned veggies so I don't think it would have been to our liking had I followed the recipe exactly.

We used this for thanksgiving dinner and it turned out great!  I was looking for something other than the same ol' green bean and onion recipe and this was perfect.  Nice flavor, easy to make, family loved it.

Another dish we love! It was easy to make and took hardly any time. I would like to make it in the microwave though. How much time would it take in the microwave?

New family favorite!  This is very simialar to old family recipe I used to make but have to say we now prefer this one! Scrumptous! Only thing I changed was I used 1 less can of green beans, 2cups of cheese, and more crackers & butter for the topping. I cooked it in a 13x9 pan and it was full!

This was GOOD and EASY!! I substituted fresh green beans from our garden and just baked it about 20 or so minutes longer. I'll definately add this to my recipe box.

Totally amazing! Subbed in Vegan ingredients. Cashew Alfredo sauce instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, and a few dollops of Tofutti sour cream. Topped with organic butter crackers mixed with melted Earth Balance and Daiya shredded cheddar.

This was a good starter recipe but I made some changes. I omitted the corn, added 1/2 the sour cream, used cream of celery, added 1/4 cup of mayo, used frozen green beans, added a bit of milk to the mixture, and mixed the cheese into the sauce. I also used crushed goldfish on top. Super yummy!!
