I absolutely love Ethiopian food - so much so I was nervous about making it because I didn't want to muck it up. This recipe did not disappoint! My only change was using fresh chopped tomatoes rather than the paste. I had to let it simmer a bit longer before and after adding the chicken to get the consistency I wanted but it was so worth it. They key here is patience, let things just barely simmer slowly and taste as you go. I made it with the recommended cabbage/potato dish (also posted by the user Twin Cities) and enjoyed with injera. Everyone went back for seconds and mopped up the sauce with the bread. Thanks for posting - I'm adding this to my "show-off" recipe box for sure! Of note: I've seen this served with a lightly dressed green salad or collard greens if you want to simplify the side dish.

Delicious. Made it as described with the exception of using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, making my own berbere. Also, found a recipe for the cabbage potato dish  mentioned (All Recipes Ethiopian Cabbage Dish) and it made a great side dish for the Doro Wat. My husband, the picky eater, had two big helpings of everything.

This dish is AMAZING! I will definitely make this again. Doro wat is incredibly fragrant and delicious. I didn't use any eggs, but it still turned out amazingly. I barely have words to describe how good this tastes. Thank you, Twin Cities for this recipe!

This dish is delicious, my family loved it. I dont eat spicy dishes my husband and kids loved it, the pot was empty. Its very spicy I tried a small piece but it was too spicy  for me. They ate it clean to the pot.

Very delicious, very spicy and very hot! I made this in the crock pot.  I only used 2/3 cup of the berbere spice because that's all I had. I subbed 1 cup chicken broth for the water and only used 1 stick of butter. That seems to be enough. I've never had Ethiopian food except for what I've made off of All Recipes. I got the  berbere spice off of Amazon. Thank You! Will definitely make again!

This was delicious!! I used a bit less butter but otherwise I have made it as is (three times). I used the linked berbere mix recipe. Everyone in the family enjoyed it a lot. Teaching it to my daughter’s Girl Scout troop tomorrow as part of a cooking badge.

I made the  Doro Wat chicken on yesterday for my family. Absolutely loved it! Because my husband does not eat eggs, I substituted them with potatoes. Still worked out great. There were no leftovers. Lol

Holy cow. I love spicy food and couldn’t eat this even after adding a pint of sour cream and adding noodles!!! Flavor is awesome though. I, too, am guessing that the amount of Berbere is WAY off or that there’s a lot of difference between brands. I suggest you make the recipe and add this spice last. Start with a tablespoon and move up until you get it the way you like. I used 2/3 cup and that was definitely too much. I’m glad I did a trial run before my party. I’m still going to make this but using my suggestion to add the Berbere last, little by little.

I loved it! Berbere seasoning can be expensive and hard to find so prepare yourself.

Just quick note: onions are not on ingredient list but is first item in recipe! ALSO!!! Probably a mistaken amount of berbere. Maybe 2/3 tablespoon?
Came out great with 2 teaspoons (quite spicy). 
I eat Ethiopian food whenever I can. Nice to have a good recipe for home prep.

Very good,  but my berbere wasn’t very authentic tasting. If anyone knows where to get an authentic berbere from Ethiopia, I? would be happy to hear of it. Mine tasted way too strong of cardamon.
