Two servings? Ha! I ate the whole thing myself. The cardamom was a bit too much, I'll decrease that and increase the ginger next time. If it wasn't for that this would be a five star for sure. Toasting the almonds adds a lot to the flavor. I ate this over plain, non-fat Greek yogurt and enjoyed it very much. Now I don't know whether to file this under "desserts" or "healthy snacks". Not a bad dilemma to have hehe.

Turned this into a yogurt parfait by layering it with granola and vanilla Greek yogurt.  This was way too much cardamon for me, overpowering the fresh flavor of the plums.   Admittedly, this could be a personal taste preference, but I can't see using more than 1/2 tsp. max.  Next time, I'll start with 1/4 tsp, taste, and add more cardamon if necessary.  But I still liked it, and definitely will make again.  Courtneymarie, thanks for sharing your recipe!
