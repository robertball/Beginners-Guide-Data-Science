Total 5-Star.! My husband said it was worth waiting for. (Had to wait for the rice to finish). He loves it and so do I. A keeper for sure. Unfortunately I forgot to take a pic.

This was fabulous.  I used the called for amount of lemon juice and 2 T dried dill.  I think the flavors were perfect.  I subbed heavy cream for the half and half/cornstarch. Will make again!

This recipe is excellent. The reason for my 4 stars is because the amount of lemon juice needs to be reduced and possibly the amount of dill too. Dill used sparingly is really nice, but if used excessively, it defeats the purpose. I would recommend to experiment with no more than 3/4 tsp of dried dill then adjust to taste. I also highly recommend using a bit more mushrooms like someone suggested. My personal touch was precisely when sauteeing the mushrooms. I added a splash of white wine and also sauteed them first before adding the onion and lastly the garlic to prevent burning of it. I served this over penne pasta and the presentation was restaurant worthy. Served with crusty bread and it was excellent for cleaning up remnant sauce.

Sorry but this did not turn out the way I thought it would. The lemon flavor was overwhelming and it spoiled the taste of the cream sauce. I would cut back on the lemon big time.

Tasty and relatively easy. My wife loves the sauce. The influence of lemon and dill are strong, following the recipe precisely. Reduce the amounts if you prefer a mellower, more subtle taste.

We liked it, but not quite loved it. I didn't have fresh dill so I used dill weed from the spice aisle., which  may have impacted the flavor. 

Also I could taste the cornstarch so next time I'll try arrowroot powder which holds up well to the acid in the lemon juice.
