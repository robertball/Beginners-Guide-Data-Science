It's a keeper, BUT with a few alterations. I did it first exactly has laid out, and it was too salty and didn't rise. The second time, I put the yeast in in the traditional way, on top. I also halved the salt, added one tablespoon of honey, and substituted butter for the lard. It turned out great this way!! And I never like homemade bread!

This has to be the very best recipe for the bread machine I have ever tried. The side bonus here is that recent medical research has found that lard is a "good fat" and less harmful than most margarines.

I recommend this highly. Just a note, I found that setting the crust for light made it more moist.

I loved this bread! Substitued olive oil for the lard, and added 1 teaspoon sugar to the mix. Placed a little of the warm water, the sugar and yeast in the bottom of the machine bowl and left to proove for ten minutes before addding the rest of the ingredients. Then baked on fast cycle (or near 2 hour cycle) and light crust selection.

THE RECIPE WAS THE BEST ONE I HAVE HAD FOR MY MACHINE. IT ROSE BEAUTIFULY AND WAS REALLY LIGHT. BUT IT LACKED TASTE. EVEN WITH THE CINNAMON IT WAS TASTELESS. I THINK IT NEEDS SUGAR AND MILK INSTEAD OF WATER.

This is incredibly easy and very good.  I've gotten consistent results (used margarine instead of lard) and have made over 5 loaves already!  I've even added craisins and walnuts for variety.  If I keep making this bread, however, I'll be weighing in at 400 lbs before you know it!!

I hated the recipes that came with my bread machine and so had quit using it.  Now that I've found this recipe I've turned it on again.  My husband loves it too.  I did add 1 T. of sugar because we like our bread on the slightly sweet side.

Finally, a recipe that makes the best buns next to a boxed mix.  Added 1T sugar and dry milk powder, also mixed the white flour with whole-grain, and perfect buns again.  Thank you.  Trust me, I've tried them all.

Not quite sure what happened, but something went wrong! I followed the instructions to the word, but the only thing I got was a lumpy mess of flour after the cycle was done. I would say it was my bread machine, but I've made dozens of loaves and nothing like this has ever happened! I will try again, it sounds really good!!

This was the best recipe I have ever used for a bread machine. The bread rose beautifully and tasted wonderful. I would definitely recommend it. I used vegetable shortening instead of lard and it came out perfectly.

This is the first bread to work in my second hand bread machine that didn't come with instructions. It needs a little more flavor. I added 1T sugar and 1T dry buttermilk. I'll make it again!

I found this very helpful.  I was struggling to get my bread machine bread to rise following the manufacturer's instructions.  Used this along with a bit of extra gluten and it's perfect every time!

I did not have a problem with this rising as some reviewers have...in fact, I thought it was going to rise too high and open my bread machine. But it was perfect, a great loaf of bread. Thanks!

Amazing!  No sugar, but it still has a great texture.  The crust was very flaky.  I did use vegetable shortening instead of the lard.  I made the cinnamon version, and it smelled so great while it was cooking I could hardly wait to try it.

I did everything the directions said...even made sure all ingredients were room temp and used a thermometer to make sure water was the correct temp. The loaf barely rose (I even checked my yeast before using by proofing some first-it was very active!). I am thinking it might be my bread machine...I can make great breads from the dough cycle but I just can not seem to make good bread IN the bread machine! I will try this recipe again--as the flavor was good and since so many other reviewers had success.

It didn't rise. Taste was just OK. I find it easier to use box mixes with much better results. I find mine in clearance aisles or distressed merchandise racks. This recipe wasn't a total waste, but not a keeper.

This bread is great.  My husband just loves it.  He is diabetic and with no sugar added and low shortening it is ideal.  I was given a bread machine with no instructions and this recipe was just what I was looking for.

Like many, I subbed margarine for the lard, put the yeast on top and added a tablespoon of sugar - and this bread is the best that's come out of my bread machine yet!  The crust was actually edible instead of a near-steel casing, and the bread was light and soft instead of almost-gooey.  This will definitely be made more often at my house!

This is a quick and easy recipe. It does eliminate the "rules" that bread machines come with. The measurements are right on. No adjustments to the dough was needed. Great tasting bread. The cinnamon is tasty also.

Unlike other breads is correct, but this was not good.  There was no sugar listed in the recipe and while the bread rose a bit, it did not rise a lot.  There was no taste, it was a waste of my bread flour.

This was a very easy recipe. I used margerin instead of lard. My son loves it tosted with butter and honey on it.

Not my favorite bread machine recipe.  I think this proves how wonderful bread machines are - even if you don't follow the rules, you get an okay result.  I've had much BETTER results following the rules.

I have been looking for a bread recipe that does not taste like it came out of a bread machine and I have finally found it.  I did make a couple of slight variations.  I used butter instead of lard and I added a tablespoon of salt and omitted the cinnamon.  Other than that I followed the recipe although I am not one to measure anything exactly and it still came out a winner!!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is the best ever bread recipe. It is our standard bread for the bread machine and the whole family loves it! I usually make a 1 1/2 size loaf or a double loaf.

I've been looking for a great all-purpose bread. I read other reviews and followed the advice to add a little sugar. I used olive oil in place of the lard/butter and I added 1 tsp. dill, 1/4 tsp pepper and cut the salt in half. We'll see if it turns out! I'll follow up on this review once it's done!

Update: a little blah... next time I will try it with butter and add more dill.

This is pretty good, but I didn't get a sky-high loaf. I think DiggetyDog's Best Bread Machine Bread from this site is still the the best basic white bread recipe for a bread machine. I must add though, that bread machines seem to vary enormously and what works for one might not work for another.

Im so happy that I found this recipe! Excellent! I followed some advice and added olive oil instead of lard and added 2 tbsps sugar for some added sweetness. I also didnt have bread flour but it turned out great with unbleached all purpose flour. Turned out yummy!! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful. Just put a pinch of sugar in it. Will have to try a different setting on my bread machine and put in more sugar, as it didnt rise as much as I was hoping. My dh loved it, and am doing another loaf right now. Thank you!

I loved this simple recipe, because you do the basic step in any bread making is to make sure your yeast is active otherwise no matter what you do it will no rise.  I did also added a pinch of sugar as my grandmother did.  Thank you for letting us share this recipe.  I too also used butter not lard.  I will try to use the bacon grease I have next time to go with Liver and Onions.

I used butter instead of lard and think I halved the salt and tossed in some brown sugar. The loaf was pretty tasteless and  fell a bit on top (too much moisture) but it had the best texture of any loaf I've made, so I'll have to study the recipe and see if I can make this basic recipe taste better.

Very bland - even with 1/2 t salt and 1/2 t sugar.  I'll try again following more of the tips from reviewers, because I did like the texture and it rose great in my bread machine.  More salt and more sugar...

LOVE it! After reading some of the other reviews, I used 2 T olive oil and 1 t sugar. I put the water, sugar, olive oil and yeast in the bottom of the pan and left proof for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. It turned out so nice and fluffy/light. Didn't fall or anything. Defintely a keeper!  :)

Just made this bread for my family today and it was a hit! It was really easy to make and the loaf turned out nice and fluffy. I substitued olive oil for the lard but that was it. I give it five thumbs up!

I mostly am a veggie now, so I used butter for the lard (Lacto-Ovo Veggie) and it turned out okay. Was it great? Not really, just good. It did not revolutionize my bread baking. I really wanted it to, as well.

This bread was perfect for eating & dipping. Not too sweet or full of other flavors it lends itself well for serving with dinner.

Bread didn't rise, even after following the "rules schmules" offered by this "master baker".  VERY disappointed with this one.

With the exception of the cinnamon, I made this recipe to the letter...the bread rose beautifully and had great texture and flavour. Going to make again for sure...(gotta make sure I didn't just get lucky) :) j/k   thanks Rob!

Ok... Here is what I know... If you know about how to make bread without a bread-maker, than you should have absolutly NO problem with this recipe! Several of the bread machines have a single paddle, that do NOT "KNEAD" the way it should, and if it is not kneaded properly, you WILL end up with an ugly mess! Mine has a single, small paddle, and it didn't mix or knead the way it should, but with a bit of added assistance (Don't be afraid of popping the lid and helping a bit!) the dough comes out nice and smooth, which will allow it to rise sufficiantly! I used butter-flavor Crisco instead of lard(have lard, but wanted it to be lighter) and I substituted 1/4c milk for part of the water(1/4c, equal exchange), and substituded 1/4 c honey for 1/8c water... I did a double recipe, due to my larger bread machine... also, used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, which should only make a difference in the weight. I did add the warm liquids and crisco, then the yeast, then waited apx 8 min before I added the flour and salt, then used BASIC/RAPID/LIGHT for my settings(Using a WestBend "America's Best" Machine) NOTE, on the second rise, DON'T open! Allow your dough to rise without interference, or it might fall, which will make a heavy, unacceptable loaf... came out perfect! Good luck to all that try this!

I used shortening due to not having any lard, and 1/3 cup of honey.  I also use half bread flour, the other half whole wheat.  This recipe is great!  I have tried so many recipes to use for my bread machine and the bread has come out horrible.  This recipe is the one I will always use because I finally am making what I wanted!

Just because there are 40 years of master baking, doesn't mean you can run a bread machine. 

I followed the instructions, but varied the ingredients a bit. Someone said that theirs didn't rise because there was no sugar to feed the yeast, so I added 1T of sugar, substituted butter for the lard, and followed the rest. What I got was a lumpy mass of something that resembled bread, but was tough and salty, even with the added sugar! I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all.

I'm trying it again, following the suggestion of cutting the salt in half, and using 1T of honey instead of sugar, and putting the yeast on top of the other ingredients. Toward the end of the kneading cycle I noticed it was several balls of yucky and not all of the flour was incorporated, so I added more water, approx. 1/3C. After adding the water, it looks like a ball of dough, so here's to hoping it rises and survives the punch down. If it tastes good, I'll be making it again, otherwise, I'm looking for a different recipe.

After reading reviews and because I wanted sweet bread, I used 8oz of warm water, 2 tbsp margarine, 2 tbsp vegetable shortening, and half a cup of sugar and a tbsp of honey. Everything else I kept the same and I put it on dough cycle and made beautiful dinner rolls.

I have mixed feelings about this bread.  It raises quite nicely, and makes a great soft sandwich loaf, and the crust is soft.  But it's not the best tasting bread even after adding a tablespoon of Sugar.   I want to give it a 3 stars for taste buy a 5 stars for texture and final product.

I had printed this recipe off in 2010 (!) and just made it a few days ago!  In 2010 it was  called "A Baker's Secret for Bread Machines."  I'm on my 2nd bread machine--had a West Bend for 20+ years that I used 1-2 times weekly before it finally bit the dust.  I then got a Cuisinart about 3 years ago--don't like it as well as it's a little more temperamental and I've sometimes had loaves that simply haven't turned out.  

I made this recipe as written--didn't add the optional cinnamon.  When I added the flour, I didn't smooth it over.  When it was done baking, I was surprised to see that the loaf hadn't risen much and the top was kind of misshapen, apparently because I hadn't leveled the flour off after adding it.  Therefore, I expected the loaf to be uncooked in the middle or have some other issue rendering it unedible.  It was done.  It's a dense bread but I think it's supposed to be that way--I don't think it's any fault of my machine.  It did have a nice crust--reminiscent of "artisan" breads.  I eagerly sliced it and put butter on it.  Taste was very disappointing--there was NO flavor to this bread!  The next time I had some, I toasted it, thinking that might improve it.  Nope.  I love bread and usually will gobble up a homemade loaf in a few days.  Haven't eaten any more of this bread for the last 4-5 days .  Given how tasteless it is, I might cut it into cubes and make croutons out of it.  Others have commented that the bread needs sugar for the yeast.

I followed the recipe but found the bread very bland. The bread did not rise as high as many of the others I've made, but it is very simple & quick to make.
   I think I will use what's left for toasted bread crumbs, it should be fine for that.
