I followed the recipe as directed.  It was not very sweet (needs about extra 1/2 cup sugar I'd say).  I liked how easy it looked, but maybe too easy.    The recipes on the graham cracker crust container is superior to this one.

Made this and it was great. Used one of those pour in the bottle packs because it was easier. It was raspberry lemondade flavor. Tasted so good. My dad who loves lemon pie seriously enoyed it. One of my favorite pies.
