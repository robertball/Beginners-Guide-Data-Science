Nice mix of flavors, but the proportions are way off.  As written, this "soup" has the consistency of a bowl of mashed potatoes.  I ended up adding another cup of broth and 2 cups of half-n-half.  It was still very thick soup. (Adding dairy messes up the vegan attribute.)  Also, 1 tsp of curry just got lost in the other flavors, so I added a bunch more.  With those changes, this is pretty good soup.

this is very similar to the carrot soup that i make; the only difference is that i do not use vegetable broth. also, i only use one potato, unless they happened to be very small potatoes, like reds or something, but russets? i can't imagine using more than one. 

instead of broth i just use water, and enough water to cover all the vegetables (thus making a broth) and when everything is tender, then puree. 

i have had a couple variations, using ginger, adding cinnamon, incorporating a 1/4 cup coconut milk or less to the mix and garnishing with cilantro and green onions. makes enough for days or a family.

This was a big hit, but I also tweaked it a bit: I added a fistful of chopped fresh coriander/cilantro,2 stalks of celery, some cumin and nutmeg.  Our vegan visitor was very pleased... and I was happily surprised as I'd normally want to add butter/cream and other vegan no-nos. Season it to your own taste. A great winter warmer (it actually started snowing while we were eating)!!

Excellent soup! I did it with water instead of vegetable stock and added a little more curry and ginger, and used just one large potato. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the suggestions from other reviewers, I used only 1 large potato, and I doubled the veggie broth. The carrots took a lot longer to get tender too, but that's a judgment call. The results?  Absolutely delicious! It's a bit spicy - I don't know if it's the ginger or the curry - but in a good way. Delicious vegan meal with some nice home style bread!

It looks like baby food but it is delicious and easy to make.  The second time I made it, I added an additional 2 cups of water so that it has a thinner quality that is more like a soup and less like pureed carrots.

This soup was very thick and filling.  The ginger compliments the soup and I am certainly satisfied after eating one serving.  I would have liked the curry taste to be more pronounced, but it fit just right.
I recommend following it with a small green salad, as the soup left a starchy sensation in my mouth.
If you use fresh ingrediants, and follow the recipe, you will be pleased with this sublty flavored and filling dish.

This soup was delicious!  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I did have to add more broth to reach soup consistency and add more curry as per other reviews.  It was extremely flavorful though for such an easy recipe with simple ingredients.  I have been looking for vegan recipes that I can take on the go with me during the work week and this is definitely one of my go-to meals.

This soup was delicious and easy!  I simmered for longer than the recipe said, because my carrots and potatoes were still firm in 15-20 minutes.  I loved the tangy taste of the ginger and curry powder.  I added some cilantro, too.  I'll be making this again, thanks!

I only put about half of the soup through the blender, and then mixed the blended and non blended together. This gives the thickness of the puree, yet still retains some texture (it looks and feels less like baby food). Over all one of my favorites.

This recipe is excellent and one of my favorites!  Thank you for sharing.  For a variation I replace the ginger with pumpkin pie spice.

I liked this soup though found I didn't like it as much after eating it a few times.  It might be a little too rich tasting for me.

This was really good, IF you can handle the chowder consistency, which my husband (thinks) he can't. (he eats it anyway). He was afraid of the Curry it called for, but even he had to admit that it was just the right amount of Curry. (he is NOT a curry fan)

I ended up doubling the broth and adding more curry and a bit more ginger. The soup is good, but will need to be tweaked depending on thickness/flavor preferences. Next time I make this, I think I'll add some cauliflower as well.

Due to allergies I unfortunately had to omit the ginger. My children did not like this at all! I found this soup somewhat bland. Would have probably been better with the ginger and maybe coconut milk.

This was great!! It's so easy too. I used about 4 to 5 cups of broth made from chicken giblets and vegetables (I happened to be making roast chicken that night too) and it came out very creamy and not baby-foodish at all. I did let it cook for about 40 minutes before pureeing though...thx for the recipe!

I love it! I made it for a big group of people. The only thing is that I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It was a bit rich for my taste. I think next time I will use less potatoes. Thanx a lot!

I thought this was great. Though some complain it's too thick for soup, i guess it depends on what you deem soup thickness needs to be.  I used 4 large potatoes, then again i think i used 6 carrots, got rid of the ginger and doubled the curry.  

I'm not sure how anyone could say it wasn't filling...it is a really thick soup.

Quite good! We enjoyed this zesty soup with hot grilled panini on a cold day. The flavors mix so well with the ginger giving it a nice kick. I made this in my pressure cooker in 7 minutes. Thank you giannadawn for your recipe.

Wonderful taste. I added the ginger at the same time as the garlic. I also put in the spices right after the veggies, before the broth. After pureeing, I borrowed an idea from a different carrot soup recipe and mixed in a 15 oz. can of coconut milk. It was a success with the family.

Made a few changes which ended up making my version un-vegan but good none the less. 

Used chicken broth instead of vegetable since it was all I had on hand, doubled that as well as the curry because I wanted it spicy. I also used one sweet potato instead of the new potatoes and added a few sprigs of fresh thyme right at the end. 

Mine didn't quite come out with the rich orange and yellow colour since I used purple and white carrots from the farmer's market instead of the standard carrot, but it was good and warm for a rather overcast day. Froze half for when there's snow. :)

This had a nice kick with the fresh ginger and cayenne powder. I also added more water besides the broth like others recommended to give it more of a soup consistency. Also, since I didn't have "new" potatoes on hand, I used two med. white potatoes. Very good

I found the idea of adding curry and fresh ginger attractive so I decided to make the soup...it came out all rite...my son found it a bit spicy so I added some milk as well. I thought five potatoes would be too much so I used one instead. Thanks for the recipe of this great carrot soup.

My wife and I just had this for lunch as well as dinner; This would probably make for a nice midnight snack as well if there was anything left ;)

Great soup for a late fall weekend, or anytime for that fact. Great combination of flavors with a stick-to-your-ribs satisfaction.  Just enough zip on your tongue to remind you you used curry and black pepper.

I added some red peppers, a pinch of cayenne and a few tablespoons of cream. It was absolutely delicious and I look forward to making it again soon!

I would add more broth next time, as it's pretty thick. I did not have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth, and it tasted fine. I will make this again. Very tasty.

This soup was wonderful !! I always double my soup recipes to freeze in jars. There was barely any left to freeze !
I doubled the cumin and fresh ( but frozen) ginger because I can’t ever leave well enough alone.   Loved it!! Thanks !’

This was delicious!  Since the size of the carrots and potatoes will vary,  you need to adjust the liquid accordingly (and to your liking depending on how thick you want the soup to be).  I also didn't have broth, so used water.  I will make this again next time I get carrots in my CSA box.

I skipped adding potatoes because I'm on a low potassium and low phosphorus Diet but soup was still thick and delicious.

I added lots more water, did not use any potatoes and also added extra curry ( I love curry) and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was a little Spivey but tamed it with some sour cream.

This was amazing. I wasn’t sure I’d like it with all of the very strong and pronounced flavors it called for. But I actually added a teaspoon more of both the garlic (I used powered instead of minced) and the curry... go big or go home right?! :) I also added more broth to make it less thick and a splash of white pepper for even more of a kick. The flavors blended perfectly and Leftovers were even better!

Added 2 more cups of veggie broth and an extra teaspoon of curry powder right off the bat based on other reviews. As a vegetarian I loved it, and my boyfriend who is not also loved it. Simple,  easy, and absolutely delicious, will make it again 100%.

as most others mentioned, was more like baby food than "soup". was prepared for after reading reviews prior to making it. added more water to it instead of broth. everything else turned out great.

This was great! We didn't have a blender at my partner's place, so we added some panko to thicken it up instead, and it worked pretty well! I think we'll try to make it at my apartment next time so we can use my blender, haha. We did also add some chicken because we wanted a little extra protein, but I think it would've been just as filling without! 10/10 will make again, possibly adding it to our regular rotation!

Loved it.  Very satisfying.  Nutritious!  I will make it again, and soon.  Helped my daughter get over "flu like" symptoms!  Great stuff.  I did add some turmeric.

Yes I used Yukon gold potatoes instead. I think they were too creamy for the soup, but otherwise I really liked it

This was a very easy recipe, and the soup comes out very thick.  It could stand another cup or so of broth is you prefer a thinner soup.

soup was easy to make.. although the curry did not have much impact on the taste and in all fairness the soup did not come out all the flavor because due to an onion intolerance. i had to substitute onions for onion flakes.

Most of the family liked this enough.  It came out both not chunky enough or not "soupy" enough for my tastes..  It ended up having the consistency of baby food.  I think I actually would have liked it better without processing it through the blender.  They say food processor but mine would have leaked the fluid so I definitely had to use the blender.  It was also a bit bland despite smelling amazing when it was cooking.  I did up the gingers and garlic.  It might have tasted a little stronger had I been able to find new potatoes but alas those don't seem to be available year round here.  I used red potatoes as those have the strongest flavor.  So my advice, don't bother blending, up the curry powder and maybe add some Italian seasoning.

This soup was great! I really changed it. I doubled the recipe, used 8 carrots, 2 sweet potatoes, 1 regular potatoes, 1/2 tsp of curry powder, chili powder and cayenne pepper and used 6c of broth.(The rest of the recipe was left as is.) MY fiance thought it was amazing and loved the heat but I had to add a big dollop of plain yogurt to cut the heat!
