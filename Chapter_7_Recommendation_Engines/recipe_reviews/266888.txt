This is a great, simple recipe. Be sure to heavily salt your pasta water (like sea water) and save some of that pasta water to add to the final dish as the starch will thicken things up.  I used chopped tomatoes, skipped the parmesan and this tasted great.  In a pinch, you can throw everything together in one pot and the pasta and other ingredients will all cook together (start with cold salted water, less water than you'd usually use), just stop cooking with the pasta is to your liking, less than the usual time. You could also use chicken broth in place of the salted water and then salt to taste.

Light, fresh, delicious!  I love the peppery flavor of arugula.  Served with chicken piccata.

Great simple recipe. I added some red pepper flakes for a little kick and some basil for a little more depth of flavor. I also added pasta water to make it a little more brothy to enjoy all these flavors.
