This is a great salad, but you need to make ahead of time to let the flavors meld together. The next couple of days it gets better tasting. I added a few dashes of distilled vinegar which i think helped. My husband actually liked it and i didn't think he would:)

This is a good, healthy salad.I added dryed cranberries and more o.j.I think you could omit mayo and just use yogurt if you want to.Fatheroflittle really liked it.It was good the next day too.We will have this again!

I added dried cranberries and pine nuts to use up pantry foods. I also used both golden and regular raisins (had them both on hand) and they looked great. I ended up doubling the liquid ingredients as it seemed a bit dry. The recipe remained healthy with the use of low fat yogurt and mayo. Big hit when served with fried chicken wings and beer while watching the game(a good way to sneak in veggies for the men).

I really liked this recipe but did a little tweaking for my taste.  I used 2 cups of broccoli and a package of coleslaw mix that you find in the produce section and then doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I love it and it's great the next day.

So so...I agree it needs some extra zing.  Played around with adding more juice.  Finally tossed in a can of manderin oranges.  Still the dressing wasn't quite right.

This was definitely healthy but I would double the wet ingredients next time since the broccoli really soaked it up! I brought this camping and it held up well.

Good combination of ingredients in the salad, however, I thought the dressing was bland.  I took one suggestion and even let it sit in the refrigerator for several hours before eating to blend the flavors.  This is not one I will make again.

I used lime juice instead of orange juice, and I thought it was good, so I would suggest using 1/2 TBS lime juice and only 1 and 1/2 TBS orange juice. Could be just that kick other reviews mentioned it needed.

This was my first time making a broccoli salad and I really enjoyed this recipe. Since I did not measure the amount of broccoli, I eyeballed how much of the other ingrediants I would need. I would definitly make this one again.

Very good.  I too, used dried cranberries. Needs a little something, I just have to figure out what. I think I'll add some sweet peppers next time.

This recipe needs a kick.  I tried adding bacon (the not so healthy approach), but it was still very bland.

A good base recipe, but a bit dry.  Doubled yogurt and mayo, but added no additional orange juice.  Also added dried cranberries.  Family loved it and healthy too

This salad was good. I agree with others to double the dressing. I also added extra sunflower seeds and extra raisins.  The amount shown wasn't quite enough.

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because of the dressing. While it's a good base, a lot of altering has to be done to get the taste right, especially if you're looking for something sweeter. Double the dressing recipe, as another reviewer recommended because the broccoli does seem to soak up the liquid.

Very tasty dish. I followed the recipe nearly as written except I substituted dried cranberries for raisins as we don't care for raisins and left out the yogurt for my lactose-intolerant Mom. I added a little sea salt and ground black pepper, and about  1/4 C of raspberry balsamic vinegar for added depth. I let it chill overnight and everyone enjoyed this dish for Easter luncheon.

Our family really enjoyed this salad.  Tangy and refreshing!  A nice change from most of the broccoli salad recipes that are loaded with mayo and bacon.  Since I had to peel an orange for the juice for dressing, I cut up the remaining segments and put into the salad.  I left out the raisins just thought it would be weird with the orange...  I loved the combination of orange and broccoli! Next time I'll make more to make sure there's leftovers.  I also added toasted pumpkin seeds as well as sunflower.  Healthy and delicious, thank you for the great recipe! Update: for those looking for a little extra flavour; the dressing definitely needs salt and pepper, I also use srping onions and put them right in the dressing.  Made again last evening and put a pinch of cayenne in the dressing, might be that little extra some of you are looking for!

This  is a great salad and so healthy.  I used NonFat-vanilla yogurt instead of plain and doubled it. Skipped the OJ and doubled the mayo.....turned out GREAT.

Oustanding! I made this for a family event, it was popular. In fact, I was asked to make it again. I do recommend adding more broccli. It seems to obsorb fast.

Light and easy. I added a little turkey bacon. It was a pot-luck hit.

I didn't like this at all. Bland and the yogurt dressing did nothing for the broccoli.
