These are great for a quick lunch.  I made these a lot back in college.  I always toast the bagel first then top with sauce and sprinkle with a bit of garlic and onion powder then add the cheese and whatever other toppings.  You know it's done when the cheese is nice a bubbly.

These are great.  I adjust to the taste of each diner, but they are much loved at our house and have been since I was a child.  I have made with bagels, but actually prefer English muffins.

There is nothing not to like about these little goodies! You can fix them however you prefer and they're always a hit with kids and adults. A great after school snack and can also be presented using mini bagels as an informal appetizer. Thanks!

I've been making these for ages and they're always a hit! Simple but yummy and 100 times quicker than the real thing. I sometimes use Bruschetta sauce instead of tomato sauce, it makes it a little more herby and grown up.

I made this using pocket-less pita bread and spaghetti sauce.  My little guy was so-so, but I thought it was quick and a great alternative to the real thing.  You could certainly get creative with this one.  Thankx Syneva.

This is a great recipe, especially for children learning the basics of food preparation! The kids used mini bagels and had a blast in the kitchen making these.  Thanks

Really enjoyed the bagel as a crust (we used onion bagels). I've made english muffin pizza before and they always get a little soggy even toasting them before adding sauce.  We did toast the bagels a little first then added sauce.  Not soggy at all and very tasty!  We omitted the pepperoni.  Will make again!  Quick easy and no clean up!

My husband loves bagels and I love a quick snack, so this works great for us. However, I usually use refrigerated biscuit dough for a more pizza-like (flat) pizza snack.

This was pretty good for minimal effort.  I just put some spaghetti sauce on it, then some tomaotes and onions on it b/c that was all I had.  Also sprinkled some garlic powder on it and some ground black pepper.  Popped it into the toaster oven, and there was my dinner.  Good for a night when you are too tired to even think about cooking.

I was out of tomato sauce so mixed a little water with tomato paste and it worked out fine. I didn't put the bagel top on, I made several halves and added a little bit of olive oil to the top of the sauce before adding my onions and other toppings.  It reminded me of my food economic class years ago. I'm having this again for lunch today.  It is quick, easy and good.

Really good! For the kids, they simple had pepperoni and cheese but for the adults - I added jalapeno peppers. And this was also a meal the kids can make for themselves.
