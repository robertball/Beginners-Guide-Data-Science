I did not care for this recipe. Cinnamon just DOESN'T go with meat and I even halved the dose! Sorry!

The cinnamon would be ok if you used a burbon sauce with this then I think it would blend the flavors better, and just a little liquid smoke. I think I will try that next.

Delicious! Very much like a Moroccan rub. I rubbed the steaks down and let them sit an hour with the seasonings macerating and then I did add a little brown sugar just to get some good caramelization while cooking.

I was very impressed with the flavor this rub has.  The spice combinations were amazing.  This will definitely be one I use all the time, goodbye Montreal Steak sauce.
