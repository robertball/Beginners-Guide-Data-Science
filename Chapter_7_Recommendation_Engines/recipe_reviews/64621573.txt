What a surprising outcome!  These buns are really "bready" with a nice crust.  I'll be making these often! Thank you for sharing it.

Best LCHF bread I have tried! Texture is like bread! I mix together all the dry ingredients and store in 4 oz mason jars. When I need bread, I just whip out the prepared dry "mix" and add to the eggs, parm cheese and cream cheese as directed. Easy peasy. Even brought a lot to Disney because the baked bread stores well!
