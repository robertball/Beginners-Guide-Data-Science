Tastes like punch.  It's o.k., but I wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was a terrific way to prepare iced tea.  Loved the taste and I would definitely make it again.  Having said that, I should admit I'm not a tea drinker (still, I could taste the tea among all the other flavors).

I love this recipe. I would add just a bit more sugar.

I love this recipe and have used it over and over for large summer parties.  A couple of things.  This tea is only as good as the ingredients you put in it.  You must use good quality (not from concentrate) orange juice and real lemon juice, you cannot omit the salt and make sure the glasses are full of ice when you serve.  You will be rewarded with a party tea worth serving again and again.

Mmm. Pretty good. Reminds me (only a little) of Arizona Iced Tea.

I'm enjoying this tea! It's a little on the sweet side, so I would cut the sugar back next time. Great for the hot Texas summer!

I didn't find this too heavy. But possibly at the hottest part of the day...it just might be. I think this is a perfect breakfast drink. Something to have with some hot fresh muffins....oh wait..?? that's what I did. LOL For a breakfast drink, it had all the right stuff. The sweetness wasn't bad(I used Splenda instead of sugar) but followed it to a T. It is refreshing, lighter then I thought it would be. It did taste a bit instant...but ya know. I don't find that bad at all. My kids really liked it and that's all that matters. It will be made again. Because we really didn't find anything bad at all with the recipe. Thanks Patty.

Really good. Like the previous reviewer, I used Splenda instead of sugar. Nice flavor. Thanks!

Left out the sugar and used Splenda. Not bad but my husband likes straight lemon instead.

We did not care for this drink; which was too concentrated to be refreshing on a hot summer's day.  That might be my fault, however, since I used an orange-flavored black tea, hence doubling the orange flavor.  At any rate, we know now that OJ is better left out of the iced tea pitcher.

I haven't made this from this recipe, but back in the 1950's my Mom used to make this for Holidays.  She didn't call it Texas Tea, she called it Tea Punch (we are Kentuckians.)  It was good for a special event but I prefer regular Iced Tea.

This was only ok.  It tasted too much like an instant tea or like nestea.  I drank it, but I won't make it again.
