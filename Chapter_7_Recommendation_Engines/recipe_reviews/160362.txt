I loved the crunch from the walnuts!  Very easy to make!  My kids are sensitive to cornstarch, so I boiled 2 large potatoes with the broccoli then pureed half the soup and the potatoes to thicken the soup. This is a keeper!  Very delicious and very different from the usual cream of broccoli soups!

I really wanted this soup to work - we're always looking for yummy soups.  My husband, oldest daughter, and oldest son didn't mind it (but also "wouldn't write home about it"), whereas my younger sons really had trouble getting it down.  We figured that if you like Asian cooking, you might really enjoy it, because it definitely has a bit of that flair.  We did make a few MINOR changes (shouldn't have affected the taste, but in all fairness, you never know)- rice milk (instead of almond milk), Bragg's Aminos (instead of soy sauce, but has the flavor of mild soy sauce), and Kuzu Root Starch (instead of cornstarch, but does the same thing).  Try it for yourself, though - you may like it!  I just probably wouldn't experiment on the kids 'til you knew if it fit in with their palates!

The best vegetarian soup I've had in a while. I decided on this on a particular cold night for dinner, and it was a perfect antidote for the chill.

I made one change for this soup.  I picket up coconut milk by mistake so I used that.  The soup was quite bland even when I added tobasco at the table.  Perhaps beef broth or roasting the broccoli would have added some depth.  

I probably won't make it again.
