After reading other reviews, I came up with my own revisions to this recipe that make it even more delicious.  I marinade the chicken overnight in a package of fajita mix with lime juice.  For remaining ingredients, I use the 8 oz. of cream cheese as the original states, 4 oz. mayonnaise, 4 oz. sour cream, the cheddar, chiles and jalapeno as recipe states, add a can of rinsed black beans, 3 sliced green onions, 1 small clove of minced garlic and salt and pepper to taste.  Delicious!

I am SO glad I didn't look at any of the reviews until after I had this mixed up. Given that the majority of the reviewers substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise called for I might have done the same. It makes me wonder if so many did that simply because, well, everybody else did.  Then there were others who said this was greasy or bland and made significant changes to the recipe.  I was nervous that since I made this just as the recipe directed that it was going to be a mayonnaisy, greasy, tasteless flop. I needn't have worried, because let me tell you,  this stuff is good!  No, I mean this stuff is GOOD. It is creamy, and chickeny and not greasy and not mayonnaisy (in fact, had I not put it in there myself I wouldn't have even known there was any). This is so nicely flavored, and certainly doesn't require any messing with to make it better. Once out of the oven (believe it or not I just heated it in the microwave for a few minutes and it turned out perfectly!) I plopped some sour cream on the top and sprinkled it with chopped green onion.  This is a dip I'd be proud to take or serve anywhere or anytime I have a need to  make or bring something awesome good.  Perfect, flawless recipe.

Hi, this is Kelley that posted this recipe. I posted a similar comment before, but just wanted to put it in again.  I've noticed that a lot of people have noted that the taste of mayo is a little strong, and some have substituted 8 oz mayo and 8 oz sour cream instead, thinking the recipes calls for 16 oz of mayo. The recipe only calls for 8 oz of mayo total. If you do want to include some sour cream, I would suggest 4 oz mayo and 4 oz sour cream.  Thanks for all the great reviews!

As per other reviewers, I used 4oz. mayo & 4oz sour cream. I also used 8oz of cubed, hot Mexican Velveeta, green onion, & taco sauce to taste, instead of the shredded cheddar, jalopeno pepper & green chili peppers. Easier & creamier. I guess, I pretty much changed the whole recipe, but whatever, it turned out great. I have had so many compliments & requests for copies of this recipe. Served it with Frito Scoops. You can make it even easier by getting a couple cans of white-meat chicken. Only needed to bake it about 30 minutes. Try it; believe me, you'll like it.

This is my favorite party dip and everyone else loves it too! I always use canned chicken breast to save some time. It is just as good as fresh chicken in this recipe and it is easier to break up. I also add a few dashes of chili powder and omit the jalape√±os because I'm not a fan. When I mix the ingedients together, I use a hand mixer. It breaks up the big chunks of chicken and really helps blend everything together nicely. Excellent party dish! Serve with Tostitos.

Ymmmm!  Have made this numerous times for parties.  I use 1 can of Hot Rotel instead of chilis as it adds color and spice.  Use 1 cup of mayonaise and 1 cup of sour cream to cut the mayo. amount and add garlic powder.   EVERYONE wants this recipe.

I first made the recipe following the other reviewers advice about using 1/2 mayonaise and 1/2 sour cream. The consistancy was too heavy and it tasted like it was missing something.  I made it a second time using 1 can cream of chicken soup and 8 oz carton of sour cream in place of the mayonaise AND the cream cheese.  I also added a small-medium, diced onion; 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1 tsp ground coriander. Now I have people begging for more.

Excellent!  Instead of serving hot, I took the cold dip and spread on tortillas and rolled them up and cut into slices.

I thought this recipe is fantastic.  Honestly, the appearance may make some folks apprehensive but once they have a bit...mmmm good.  To add additional color, I have also added a small jar of drained, diced pimentos.  I have also substituted miracle whip for mayo when I am out of it.  Either way, the taste is wonderful.  I'd bring it to any party!!!

Great dip with a few changes. Since its called Chicken enchilada, I added 3T of enchilada sauce to half the dip and left out the chili peppers. The other half of the dip (15 servings) I added a half envelope of Taco seasoning and left out the chili peppers. The extra seasoning seemed to enhance the original recipe. Also I used 4oz mayo and 4oz sour cream. Yummy!

This was very easy and yummy.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, skipped the jalapeno and added a drained can of Ro-tel tomatoes with mild chilies.  I also used half a packet of taco seasoning sprinkled over the chicken while it baked and added the other half to the dip.  Baked on high in my slow cooker for 2 1/2 hours, then kept on the "Keep Warm" setting for the rest of the party.  Served with tortilla chips.  Yum!

Great dip!  Everyone loved this at our New Years Eve party!  I did make some modifications similar to others reviews.  I cooked the chicken breasts in a slow cooker on high for 4.5 hours with a cup of chicken broth and a package of fajita mix. Very easy to shred w/ this cooking method.   I used 4 oz of mayo and 4 oz of sour cream.  I used a can of Rotel Tomatos w/ diced green chiles and a can of diced jalapenos instead of a fresh pepper.  It definitely had a kick to it, but our group likes it hot!  I will definitely make this one again!

Wow. I took this to a baby shower and everyone LOVED it. I had to hand write the recipe for 2 people! One of the best recipes I've found on this site(out of 300+). I diced the chicken and seasoned it with Mexican seasoning and cooked it on the stove. Then I shredded it. I used half cup of mayo and half cup of sour cream, and half velveeta for cheddar so it wasn't greasy. With these changes, I thought it was perfect.

I added 1 LARGE can green chile enchilada sauce, 1 cup sour cream (NO mayo!!), Rotel diced tomato and habanero peppers, generous crushed r. pepper and baked the chicken coated in cumin, garlic and chili powder before shredding. Really spicy when I'm done with it, it's now a family favorite after just the 1st bite. I also used fat free cream cheese and sour cream along w/ reduced fat shredded cheese to lighten it up a bit w/out losing flavor.

I use canned chicken breast instead of broiled fresh chicken breast.  I drain and rinse the canned chicken and it cuts down time.  I also use chopped chives and a little onion powder.  I get requests for it all the time for friends parties.  I have to keep the recipe with me because I am sure to get requests for the recipe.

Office potlucks always make me nervous, but this dip was a HUGE hit!  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  The pickiest eater in the office parked herself right in front of the dish with a bowl of chips in her lap!  I'll probably add more chilis or another jalepeno next time, and maybe make 1/2 of the cheese Monteray Jack or Pepper Jack, but I like spice!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and everybody loved it! I added 8oz of sour cream, a can of Rotel tomatoes, and extra cheddar before baking. I served it with Hint of Lime Tostitos. Next time I will put it in a slow cooker to keep it hot! We are eating leftovers with rice wrapped inside flour tortillas and they're great too!

This was extremely 'runny' when heated....dripped right off the chip. Was thinking of using it as a quesadilla filling, but when that clearly wasn't going to work I was able to use it as a 'cold' filling in a tortilla and roll up and cut into pinwheels. Worked out perfectly. Needed some sprucing up with green onions, spices etc....but a good starting point to work from.

Small adaptations:  2 large chicken breasts (already cooked, shredded)  8 oz low-fat cream cheese, 4 ounces low-fat sour cream, 1 can Ro-Tel tomatoes with mild green chilis (1/2 juice drained), 6-8 ounces cheese.  I think adding the tomatoes with chilis made this really awesome in flavor, and the tomatoes added a good color, too.  I will keep playing around to make it even a little better, but I had many positive comments at the BBQ tonight!

I chose this dip to bring to a party because of the reviews and it didn't disappoint, one man said I am not leaving this party until my wife gets this recipe, it's the best, then the hostess wrote me a thank you note and asked for the recipe, it was delicious and the first food to be eaten. I made it exactly as written but added extra diced jalapenos. YUMMMM

This was good but it was missing something. Kind of bland which surprised me. I never use jalapeno because I don't like real hot food, but I followed the recipe as written and even with the jalapeno, it didn't have much kick. Maybe all jalapenos are not created equal? Or maybe jalapenos are not as hot as I've always imagined?  I added some chili powder and a little cayenne. I also think it benefits from the addition of some salt. I was grateful for my mini food processor. It made quick work of the shredding and incorporated the jalapeno very well. It also resulted in a finer consistency than I could have acheived had I shredded by hand. Overall, it is worth repeating with the modifications I mentioned and I'll take suggestions from others to add some onion and garlic.
A note about the mayo issue. Some of the earlier reviews revealed a little confusion about the amount- ie: substituting 8oz sour cream AND 8oz mayo.  The TOTAL amount of mayo in the recipe is 8oz.  The 16oz that is made reference to in the recipe is the size of the jar and you are supposed to use half.

Great dip!  I grilled my chicken instead of baking, added garlic salt, more chiles, and cayenne pepper for an extra kick.  I will definitely make this again. I made sure to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces for easy dipping.

I made this for the Superbowl this year and my guests liked it, but I found it to be a little too oily.

Delicious with some minor adjustments.  I used a whole pre-roast chicken from the grocery store  (easily shreds).  I added 1/2 sauted onion, 1 t cumin, a can Rotel tomatoes, did half the mayo and used sour cream for the other half.  I also used the reduced fat cream cheese (not the fat free!).  Serve it with a bowl of salsa on the side so the color can be spiced up a bit.  Great recipe that my family chowed down!

Seems like it would be missing something when you make it. But wait until it is tasted! Delicious. I will keep this one on hand for another party where I need an appetizer. Nice change from the buffalo chicken dip!

I added 8oz sour cream, only a dolip of mayo, 2 cans of chilis, 2 jalapenos, 1/2 to 3/4 cup salsa, substituted mexican blend cheese for cheddar, and bought the chicken pre-cooked, shredded, and seasoned in taco flavoring (old el paso).  With these substitutions everyone loved it--it was still not spicy/hot with these subs-so if you really want to kick it up, I would add some serrano chilis to the mix.

Pretty good. I did season the chicken with cumin and salt and peper before baking, and added some taco sauce, but it still was not very spicy.  My husband wanted it much spicier. I also used a mexican blend of cheese (cheddar and m-jack), and did half sour cream, half mayo. next time I will add a taco seasoning packet like others mentioned.

I took this dip to a football party yesterday and it was a big hit everyone wanted the recipe.  I did add a few more jalepenos because it seemed like it needed a little more kick and I added some Fiesta party mix spice from Tastefully simple but I'm sure any kind of southwest or taco spice would be great.  I also thought of adding some salsa next time for a little different flavor.  This is a great recipe that you can adapt to your taste!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I made this doubling the recipe except for the  shredded cheese (used about 12 oz.) and mayo amount-16 oz. of mayo seemed like a lot for a dip.  I also added 1 can of rotel tomatoes and chiles to it as well.  It was soooo good with tortilla chips.  Will make again!!!!

What a hit at the Halloween Party!  I only used 4 oz. of mayo and added a cup of cheese.  I also added Rotel and Adobo; made it the night before and then threw it in the fridge.   An hour before the party, all I had to do was put the dip in a crock pot and watch it disappear....!!

Loved this dip!  It was even better on the second day.  Definitely a change from the usual cheese dip.  I made it exactly as written, and will do it that way from now on.

Everyone at the party was RAVING about this appetizer! I had a can of diced jalapenos so I used that in place of the fresh jalapeno and can of diced chiles. It made for a spicier dip, but it wasn't over the top spicy. I used the suggestion from Naples of adding a dollop of sour cream (I did three, as my pan was regtangular) and sprinkled with chopped green onion. Not only did it taste great, it looked pretty too! So quick and easy to throw together, I'll keep this one handy! Served with a bag of tortilla strip chips. Yum...

I use sour cream instead of mayo, and add a can of diced tomatoes w/ green peppers.  I also add a packet of enchilada seasoning for some kick.  I throw everything in a crockpot with the cooked, shredded chicken, and take this to work potlucks on a regular basis.  This is a HUGE hit.  I've also used canned chicken in the past when I've been in hurry and it tastes just the same.  The recipe listed on here is pretty bland, but I've found with the changes, it's amazing.

This was wonderful after a few changes to the recipe, hence only the 4 stars. Added one can of rotel, used 2 japs, 1/2 the mayo and substitued the other amount with sour cream, baked off the chicken with taco seasonings, and used a combo of velveeta cheese and shredded cheese. I have now made this twice in less than a week. Once in a crock-pot and the other time in the over. Both great and everyone absolutely loved! I had to make numerous copies of the recipe to hand out.

I would have given this 5 stars but I doctor it up a bit.  I use 4 oz of Lite sour cream and 4 oz of Mayo instead of all mayo.  I also add 1 tablespoon of Taco seasoning and use Cheddar Jack cheese.  By using the lite sour cream and Cheddar Jack cheese it cuts down on the oil.  It is a rich dip but a croud pleaser!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! First thing gone on the table at Christmas, everyone loved it! I had to make it two more times that same week. I made a few variations using things I had on hand. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot with cayenne pepper, black pepper, oregano, garlic and chicken broth. Shredded the chicken and instead of the jalapeno I just used half pepperjack cheese and half sharp cheddar. I tried it with both regular and fat free cream cheese, regualr and fat free mayo, couldnt tell the difference (husband never said a word during dip inhalation) the chiles and the mayo give it a tang that you crave!

This was very good! I took it to a new year party and they really loved it, they asked me to make it for super bowl :o) I used 1 cup of Mayo and 1 cup of sour cream instead of the 2 cups of mayo that it called for. It's a keeper!

Hands down one of the best dips I have ever eaten.  Absolutely incredible.  Everyone raved over this appetizer and begged for the recipe.  I poured enchillada sauce on top and added extra diced peppers on top to garnish.  We thought adding rice would make an excellent casserole, too.  I will make this to fill tortillas, because it is the best chicken enchillada recipe on the planet.

This was simply wonderful! I topped it with a can of enchilada sauce and decorated it with sliced black olives and jalepenos (from the jar) for extra zip and eye-appeal. Marinating the chicken in a spicy dry rub before baking gave it a lot more depth and flavor. Word to the wise -- do NOT try to double this recipe unless you have a VERY large casserole dish that will allow you to spread it out thinly.

This dip made me the hit of the party!  I made it for my sister's bachelorette party and the women were flipping for it.  When the guys joined us later that night, they polished it off in about 2 minutes.  It was really, really good--different than the typical dips we see at parties.  I couldn't really rate the "Kid friendly" aspect, as there were no kids there to try it.  Will definitely make again!  Oh, and I just boiled my chicken and shredded it.  Used about 2 tablespoons of jarred jalapenos (diced them), instead of fresh.

I used a savory rotisserie chicken from the grocery store for the chicken.  I also used 4 oz of sour cream and 4 oz of mayo instead of the 8 oz of mayo.  I also used a mix of sharp and mild cheddar cheese.

It seemed very bland when I tasted it before cooking, so I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder and onion powder.  Even after cooking, it was still very bland.  I also cooked it about 10 minutes longer than it called for to ensure the center was done.  I made it in a pie dish.

This is a good base for a dip, but next time I'm going to add additional spices, maybe even a packet of taco or enchilada seasoning.  It could also easily be converted to a buffalo chicken dip simply by adding wing sauce to it before cooking.

I'm always looking for different appetizer receipes. This one was a big hit with my husband and fitriends we had over for dinner. I used some frozen buffalo style chicken nuggets, cooked them in the oven, and then cut them up in put in the mix. It was great! My husband said that was the best dip I have made in a long time! I will be using it for future parties and one coming up at my friends house next week!

Delicious! I make this for many gatherings and the plate is always totally cleaned. I also substituted 4 oz sour cream and 4 oz mayo. No jalapenos, I don't like them.

This was very good, however I personally didn't like them with tortilla chips.  I think next time I will make tortilla chips however I will find a way of keeping them semi-soft, and serve them warm with this dip.

It was a hit at the tailgate I took it to. Baked the chicken with taco seasoning and added a can of fat free Cream of Chicken to the mix.  I used a can of hot chilis and a can of jalapenos.  It was spicy but fine for most people!

I bring this app to every party and I usually print about 3 copies of the recipe because everyone is always asking me.  the only thing I change is that I use a can of diced jalapenos (same size as chiles) in place of the one jalapeno.  Definitely spicy, but everyone loves it!

I make this for a lot for pitch-ins and people seem to really like it.  I always use a large can of chicken to save time.  Do not use Miracle Whip/salad dressing instead of mayo.  I usually use the Mexican blend of cheese instead of cheddar.  Sometimes I add some cumin, onion powder or other spices, but I like it fine without the extra spices.  I've also left out the peppers and used a can of Rotel (drained) instead.

this recipe is delicious!  made it for the holidays and football games and there is never any leftovers!  
i made a variation of it also substituting the chicken with  ground breakfast sausage but make sure to brown the sausage and drain it very well so it is not greasy.  using mild, medium or hot ground sausage to your taste... yummy!

I have had this recipe for the last 5 years, and I have always made with the original ingredients.  It is sooo good and very popular...family/friends always ask me to make it for a get together.  There can be other dips at a gathering as well, but the chicken enchilada dip ALWAYS is the first to disappear!!.  Not to mention, I've given this recipe to numerous people over the years, but I wish I could take credit for coming up with it on my own, but would like to thank Kelly for putting it on allrecipes for so many others to enjoy...it is so delicious...some people have mistaken it for crab dip!  It is a meal in and of itself!

Very good!! & a break from the popular Buffalo Chicken Dip. I added a can of SW corn, bean, pepper mix, a little bit of taco sauce, and about a teaspoon of minced garlic (as suggested). Also, I through it all in a little crock bc I had to travel. Loved it!

This dip was great! It made a good sized amount. I will use more jalapeno and hotter canned green chiles. I used mild chilies, and think it could use more of a kick. Use a heavy cracker or sturdy tortilla chip, this dip is pretty hefty.

Yummy!  I also did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo as other people have suggested.   To kick it up, I added some spicy salsa, was a hit at my work potluck, will be making again.

I love this recipe I have been making it for several years.  I do change it up a bit.  I season the chicken breast with taco seasoning, add 8 ounce of sour cream and a can of rotel tomatoes.  It is always a hit!!

This is a family favorite, but with a variation. Adding 1 pkg. of Taco Seasoning is the trick.  Mix the Taco Seasoning with the cream cheese and mayo first.  Then add other ingredients.  Can use light mayo and light cream cheese -- these are just as good.  However, don't use reduced fat cheddar cheese.

This is *really* good! I had my doubts, but gave it a try, and I'm glad I did. I used 4 oz mayo and 4 oz sour cream (that just seemed like way too much mayonnaise). I used a can of green chiles in the dip, then covered the dip with a layer of shredded cheese and added another 1/2 can of chilis on top. Very tasty, everyone loved it. My go-to chicken dip has been Buffalo Chicken Dip for a long time, but this one is going into the rotation. Thank you!

Everyone asks for this recipe! It's a sure hit. I add sour cream because it gives a creamier flavor. Love it! One hint try to keep it warm either in a chafing dish or a crock pot. It has to stay warm to look appetizing.

I have made this dip before and although I liked it, was not overly impressed. However, tonight I made it and used it as an enchilada filling. Much better. I followed the directions, only sesoning my chicken before baking, which is a must for the ultimate flavor. (I used chili powder, cummin, garlic etc..)For my personal preference, enchilada sauce is important when I want an enchilada taste, so I doused the finished product in the sauce. I was very happy with the outcome. I will use this as a filling for enchiladas many times over! Thank You!

Amazing dip!  It's a party favorite and I've had numerous requests for the recipe!  The only thing that I did differently to save time was a substituted the chicken with ready made perdue roaster chicken instead of baking my own.

This was very good, but I think I'll make a couple of modifications for next time. It could have used a little more zip, so I'll use more jalapenos next time. I'll also sprinkle some additional cheese on top.

I served this at a family get together and it was gone in 10 minutes! I also modified the recipe by including 4 oz mayo and 4 oz sour cream (instead of 8 oz mayo). To save some time, I used a precooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, shredded the breast and coated it with some fajita seasoning (mixed with a little water to help coat).

Love this receipe however i went ahead and nixed the mayo completely and used sour cream instead.  Also cooked chicken in taco seasoning which adds some great flavor.

This was a huge hit with girl's night and I know the men would love it too!!! It has a nice kick to it. I read the reviews and added green onion, 1 clove of garlic and did only 4 oz. mayo and 4 oz. sour cream. Great with Frito scoops.

This dip is great! I am expected to make it  everytime we have a get together. I amde a few changes, though. I cut up 1/2 a block of velveeta cheese, 2 cans of chicken, cream cheese, scoop or two of mayo and sour cream, and instead of chiles put a can of rotel tomatoes, then top with shredded cheese. This dip has become famous with ou friends and family.

This is a keeper! I seldom make it as a dip, usually use it as a filler for enchiladas with the red sauce from this site. We attend or host a tequila tasting party every year, and these are a must have on the list. Very filling, so I sometimes use the small flour taco shells instead of burrito sized, especially for a party.

I was sadly disappointed in this recipe...it turned out much blander than I expected and was way too greasy for my taste.  I like the idea of adding taco seasoning...

Instead of baking the chicken breasts, I boiled them in 2 cups of Chicken broth to give them flavor & moisture. 
I added to the dip mixture a can of Campbell's Creamy Chicken Verde Soup,soup cream, cumin and McCormack's Mexican Seasoning and lighted up on the mayo & cream cheese. I then added some sliced green onion to the mixture before baking. After baking to heat thru, I sprinkled some sliced green onions on top with extra shredded mexican style cheese. I've made this twice now and everyone has loved it! Will definitely make again.

I was a bit skeptical, but this was a huge hit with my family, especially the men.  Got a bit of a kick to it too.  Rather than cook in the oven, once all mixed together, I put it in the crock pot.  I also added taco seasoning for some flavor.  I might double the recipe next time since it went so fast.  A big hit!

I made this for poker night and it was a huge hit.  I mixed it all together and put it in my slow cooker on high for about 3 hours, then kept it on low for the rest of the night, serving it right out of the slow cooker.  I would HIGHLY recommend that everyone try to find REAL New Mexican green chili when any recipe calls for green chili.  True, as someone previously mentioned,  the canned stuff really has no taste, but the roasted, frozen product from NM makes any dish like this a much better experience.  A company named Bueno makes sells frozen green chili in mild, hot, and red (Walmart stores carry it here in Utah), I've also found it in 5 pound chunks in other grocery stores.   I adjusted the amount of jalapeno to make this a little bit spicier too.

This dip is wonderful! The only thing I do different is after cooking and shredding the chicken, I put everything in my crockpot on high until the cheese is melted and then turn on low to keep it nice and warm.

A really yummy dip, different than most dips you see at parties or restaurants. The two peppers give really great, mild flavor - some more peppers would be needed if you're craving a spicy dish. I love how the ingredients are always on hand at my house. The mayo does make the dip a little oily, but it doesn't leave an aftertaste. I might try subbing some sour cream for the mayo next time, but this is superb without any changes. Thanks so much for sharing.

The core of this recipe is great, but I had to kick it up a few notches. I added New Mexico Hot Chili Powder, some cumin and garlic salt. I also boiled my chicken with some boullion and onion and shredded the chicken. Talk about flavor. Olives also were added and let me tell you, there wasnt any left overs!

This dip is delicious!  I am always asked to bring it and to share the recipe.  I do make some changes though.  

I season the chicken with cumin and chili powder and garlic salt before baking.  I usually use 2 8oz. bricks of cream cheese and use about 8oz. mayo and then use about 8oz. sour cream.  Then I use hot chili peppers (from the jar) instead of the jalepeno.  It is very good if you use Fritos Scoops for dipping.

It is so good!!!!  I don't think it's greasy.  It does get greasy if it sits for awhile and gets cold, but this dip always gets eaten so fast it doesn't have a chance!

I followed this recipe and even made a couple of suggested changes, but it was very greasy and no one would touch it.  Maybe changing the cheese from cheddar to velveta or eliminating the mayo all together would help.

I brought this to a Christmas Party at work and everyone loved it.  I used a mexican blend of cheeses (not taco)and less cream cheese.  To save time, I used pickled jalepenos and a package of Tyson pre-cooked chicken.

I am a VERY picky eater and I have to say that this recipe was DELISH!  I used 2 large cans of chicken, added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and a handful of sliced green onion as others have suggested and it was a hit!  Thank you!

This is the best dip ever.  Everywhere I take it I have to hand the recipe out.  I add 3/4 of a jar of chopped jalapeno peppers for a spicy kick and a cup of sour cream for an extra creamy texture.

I was going to make this as an appetizer on Christmas Eve (to go with chili), but was invited to a pre-Christmas party where everyone had to bring an appetizer, so decided to take it there first.  I came home with an empty dish.  Everyone at the party RAVED about it.  I made it again for Christmas Eve as planned and again had no leftovers.  My family gobbled it up.  It is really good!  The only change I made is that I did not add the jalepeno pepper, because I was afraid it would be too spicy.  It was fabulous!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

This was really good for a chicken dip.  I really prefer meatless or ground beef dips, but this was really good.  I added some taco seasoning, 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and a little cayenne and chili powder to give it more kick.  I will make this again. Thanks

This is a really good dip!  I was invited to a party at the last minute, had all ingreds. and quickly threw this together.  The only ingred. I didn't have was the mayo, so I used sour cream instead.  This is a keeper, and I will be making it again this week to share with coworkers.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kelly.

This dip is great!!! I add 1/4 cup salso to give a little more spice.  I use fat free cream cheese and low fat mayo, and it still tastes great.  My family asks for it often, and it is a party favorite!!

I was looking for something different to take to a family Christmas (I am always in charge of the snacks and dips) and this fit the bill! It turned out great! Everyone thought that it was a keeper!

I always do my own thing with recipes - never following them to the letter. However, I followed this one and it came out perfect. I served in a small crock pot as a dip with Tostitos arrayed around it.

I made this recipe amoung many others for a recent party.  It was by far the crowd favorite.  Just about everyone asked me for the recipe.  I was weary about adding the jalapeno pepper, but decided to do so.  I'm glad I did  It gave it just the right amount of flavor without being too spicy!

I made this for a friends bday brunch (among other things) and this was definitely a crowd pleaser and such a snap to make.  I used less mayo than suggested, marinated the chicken and served with tortilla rounds.  I already have requests to make it for another upcoming party.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Now if we could only find a fat free version...

This recipe is awesome!  I changed some on the recipe according to the other reviewers.  I only used 1/4 cup mayo and then 8oz sour cream, also added a 1/4 enchilada sauce to give it some color.  Marinated the chicken in chili,taco or fajita seasoning and then grilled in on my foreman grill.  After baking, added some pepper jack cheese and another can of drained green chilies to the top for presentation.  Everyone loved it!

A wonderful recipe, it's now a picnic favorite.  I use fajita seasoning on the chiken while I cook it, otherwise it is a little bland.   Other than that, I don't change a thing!

This has become my "go to" appetizer. Friends are disappointed if I have a party and don't make it.  I've modified it a bit by using 2 jalapenos for more heat and using light cream cheese, mayo and cheese to cut back on calories a bit.  Using the food processor to shred the chicken is a huge time saver.  Thank you.

I've been making this for years. It's always a big hit. I made it as directed, and have since incorporated the following changes:
Use 1/4 of the cream cheese
Add about 1 cup sour cream 
Leave out green chilis and add 1-2 cans rotel tomatoes (I like mine hot)
Add cayenne pepper to taste
Use Tilamook extra sharp Cheddar or sub some extra sharp black diamond white cheddar 

This is a great make-ahead dish. I think it's best when I can premix everything and refrigerate overnight and bake the next day. The flavors seem to really meld.

I took this to a party and it was a hit! If you can't keep it warm it stiffens up a little bit but still yummy. I used half greek yogurt/half mayo to lighten it up a little. I would make this again!

We've made this yummy dip about 8 times in the last couple of months. Everyone we serve it to, loves it! We didn't make any changes - it's perfect as it is. Thanks for posting this recipe - it's now our "go-to" recipe for social gatherings... and also sometimes just for us!

I tried it for the first time, used half a jar of salsa instead of the green peppers and jalapeno peppers, next time I will use more and maybe add some chopped tomatoes. It was really good but I felt like something was missing. I will definitely make it again but use the sour cream instead of mayo.

This is a very good dip, I get compliments on it all the time.  I do add more green chiles, but I love green chiles! Also, I have made it with low fat cream cheese, 2% cheese, and reduced fat mayo, and you can't tell the difference. I have also made it with part mayo/ part reduced fat sour cream as many others have suggested and I think I prefer it that way.

This was a huge hit last night!  I used the 4oz each of mayo and sour cream and instead of baking the chicken, I sauted in a touch of olive oil and added minced garlic and hot taco sauce.  Once the chicken was done, I poured the remaining taco sauce and garlic into the mix...yummy!  Will definitely make again soon!

OMG, this is good stuff!  I didn't change a thing from the recipe.  However, next time, I might add another jajapeno just to kick it up a bit, or maybe throw in a Tbs. or 2 of enchilada sauce.  But trust me, I'm not complaining.  This was one of my more popular Easter dinner appetizers, for sure.  Served with tortilla scoops.  Thanks, Kelley.  Great recipe!

It was good but I made a few changes. I used 8 ounces of green chile peppers, added a can of rinsed and drained black beans, and added about half a packet of dry taco seasoning. With these changes it turned out amazing!

Delicious! I substituted 1/2 the mayo for sour cream (like many others) and it came out perfect. I did find the taco seasoning a little overpowering, so would only add a tsp of it next time.

This is very tasty and very easy to add to. We like black beans and black olives in ours just to give it something extra.

I made this to curb my craving for something warm, creamy, cheesy, spicy, and GOOD!! Boy, did it ever. I didn't change the recipe much. I only had canned chicken, so I used that. It did not affect the flavor. I used jalapenos from a jar because that was all I had. And I topped with cheese and baked. It turned out great!

This dip was good, but we thought it was missing "something".  If we make it again, I'll add black olives or something.

This recipe is great. I cook my chicken with Taco seasoning to give it extra flavor. The mayo sounds weird but this recipe is wonderful. This is one of our must haves at party's and of course for Super Bowl. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was so yummy! I made it with the ingredients listed, except I used 4oz of mayo and 4oz of sour cream since truthfully that much mayo scares me. I also just boiled the chicken, then used a food processer to chop it to save time. Everyone loved it and I have requests to make it for the holidays. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this dip today for a party, and it went over very well.  I would give it 5 stars, but I don't think the proportions are quite right.  I doubled the chiles, and it was still a bit bland.  I think next time I'll double the jalepeno as well (it wasn't spicy at all).  But overall, the texture and taste were great, just needs more umph!

This was a good recipe but I thought it would better be suited as a filling for enchiladas rather than a dip.
Will make again when making chicken enchiladas!

great recipe first time I tried it, it was a hit. Always have no leftovers and I usually double or triple the recipe.
I did add some spices to the recipe because I thought it was missing, I add a couple ounces hot pepper cheese, some garlic salt,cumin,pepper, and cayenne pepper.

This is a go to dip if we are invited over to someone's house at the last minute. Easy to make and great to eat.  I do use a large can of chicken. Just easier for me.

Huge hit at the last party I had.  Substituted two cans of chunk chicken breast (to shortcut) and used a can of the diced tomato and green chilies (hot) and drained that in place of the peppers. Will make many times again!

This recipe got raves from many of my friends. The changes I made were as follows: I used 2 10oz. cans of chunk chicken, because I didn't have time to actually bake any chicken, and instead of 8oz. of mayo, I used 4oz. of mayo and 4 oz. of sour cream. For me, I like things to be spicy, and this dip didn't have enough kick for me, but it got so many compliments from my friends, which is why I gave it four stars. It definitely seems to be a crowd pleaser!

this recipe is always a hit! i usually double the recipe and switch out the green chilis for 4 serrano peppers.  they have such an awesome flavor. also it is really good with a cheese like colby/monterey jack cheese instead of the cheddar.

This dip was just okay to me...a little bland I thought, but my mom really liked it. Maybe I will try some garlic and sour cream instead of mayo, more peppers and salt.

This dip was a real crowd pleaser and it went very fast.  Very good dip.  I would not use canned chicken as it would make this way too salty.  I would go the extra step and use the freshly cooked chicken breast.  I poach mine.  (I season with salt and pepper and put in a frying pan and cover the chicken with water and simmer until cooked)  I think the meat is juicer this way. I did add half a pack of taco seasoning also. Awesome stuff!

Brought it to a party and everyone loved it!  I put in two jalapenos and it  still could have used more heat.  I think next time I'll cook the chicken with lime and tequila and add fresh cilantro.  This one's is a keeper!

I made this recipe as written and although it turned out great I think next time around I'll do as others suggest with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream instead of all mayo, along with an extra jalapeno.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

What a hit! My family and co workers LOVE this dip. I think it needs a little taco seasoning or something I also added jalopenos on top before baking.

This dip is fantastic, I make it all the time and everyone devours it and I always double the recipe. I to go with half mayo and half sour cream, when cooking the chicken I add taco seasoning and sometimes add a little salsa, I serve it with tostitos hint of lime chips and it is great. I got the recipe from my sister-in law and have given the recipe to so many people. thanks

I've made this so many times, and everyone I've made it for has asked for the recipe. I did make some changes. I substituted sour cream and cream of chicken soup, and I added olives. When I use fresh chicken, I use a bouillion as well. This is my fave recipe from this site. Thanks for posting it!

What a great dish!  I served it with club crackers at a party and everyone loved it.  Almost everyone asked for the recipe.  I modified it slightly... adding green pepper and onion in lieu of chili and jalapeno peppers.

This was an easy dip to make and got rave reviews from some pretty picky eaters.  Even with a large jalapeno--it was mild enough for those who don't like spice.  GREAT APPETIZER!

This recipe is yummy, but usually ruins dinner appetites if you are serving as an appetizer (since it is so rich)!  I prefer to leave out the jalapeno pepper.

This is quite tasty. Fixed it for friends and they raved about. However, I did add, to taste, some garlic and onion powder, as well as some seasoned salt. This gave it just a bit more flavor without taking anything away from the other flavors. Very good with tortilla chips.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I was in a hurry and decided to use a rotisserie chicken, which tasted great, but next time I would leave out the dark meat because it affected the color.

This was very good, but too thick for a dip in my opinion.  Ended up using it as a sandwich filling.  Wonderful creaminess.  I coated chicken with taco seasoning and sauteed in pan.  Shredded in the pan and simmered with a bit of water to let the spices soak in.  Used a 7oz can of green chiles, didn't make that much of a difference I think.  Picky boyfriend didn't care for it, but like I said, he's picky.  I'll be making it again for myself!!!

This was very good! I added some garlic and onion powder. I also added some hot sauce and pepper for extra taste. Also towards the last five minutes of baking i added some more cheese. This is a keeper. Thanks.

This recipe went over extremely well at a party tonight.  It was the only appetizer to be devoured completely.  I used half a jar of sliced jalapenos and ran it through the food processor to dice them finely.  I made a double batch and also used 1 packet of hot taco seasoning and about a cup of sour cream.  Everyone thought it was delicious and I had both women AND men asking for the recipe!!  I will definitely be making again.

This should be called Chicken Enchilada Casserole because it was a huge hit with the office and nobody used the chips.  They said it was awesome without it!  I handed out a recipe to everylady in the office.  Only substitution I made, was I used 2 large cans of Tyson's chunck chicken in place of the chicken breasts.

Excellent!  Be prepared though:  with the word "dip" i expected something not quite so dense -- but it tasted excellent.  Being from Texas though I would most likely add more peppers next time. I used one serano pepper as well as a bit of onion powder...and  while it was good, a slight bit more spice would hit the spot! Served with picante sauce on the side and most everyone added it to their dip.

AWESOME!!!  I made this for a party in October and months later, I am still getting requests.  I did not add fresh jalapenos, instead I used diced ones from a jar. I add extra jalapenos.

This is a GREAT dish! My husband and I will make it just for ourselves on a Saturday night.  It is a big hit at parties too.  I did add about half a package of taco seasoning, but it is good without it too.  Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  My son-in-law goes crazy over this, so I always make sure I have it on hand for him for all special occasions.  I substitute a can of sliced jalapeno peppers for the diced green chilis (we love spicy-hot), and I also often substitute canned chicken when pressed for time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Best dip I've ever tasted!  I took advice from several others' reviews and used sour cream, taco seasoning, and a spicy rub for my chicken before putting it on my Foreman grill then into a food processor.  Since I didn't have a jalapeno available, I used a whole fresh homegrown cayenne pepper--that put just the right amount of kick into it.  My husband and his sister, who hate mayonaise, ate it up!  The entire bowl was gone with only four people eating it.  My sis-in-law is dying for the recipe.  I used fried flour tortillas cut up in wedges for my dippers also.  I will definitely make this dip again and again!

Most Excellent! 5 star rating is with my alterations: Used an extra can of green chilies, plus extra jalapeno for more zip! Cut back a bit on the mayo, used chunk white chicken breast meat (canned) mixed with 2 tsp taco seasoning, a couple dashes of cumin and garlic powder.

I served this at a house-warming party and it was a hit.  I made four small dishes, two vegetarian and two with chicken, both dissapeared as fast as I could bring them out.  I was able to put this together about 5 minutes before my guests arrived.  Being so young, people couldn't believe I had made this myself and to this day people can't wait to come over and see what else I can whip together!  I've been keeping the ingredients on-hand ever since...

This dip is awesome!  It makes a good size portion.  When there are leftovers, my husband rolls the dip up in a tortilla.  He loves it that way.

I tried this recipe at one of our football parties.  Needless to say, it went over BIG.  I've made it several times since then and everytime, people rave about it.  THANKS!

I love mayonnaise, but I just didn't like it in this dip, also it was too bland.  I will use it as a base to try again.  I am thinking, sour cream instead of mayonnaise, more green chilis, garlic powder, cumin, and pepper jack cheese.

Great dip!  I've taken this to 2 parties and get tons of compliments on it.  I've never had throw out the leftovers.  I did add an extra jalapeno the second time for a little more zip, but it is great as it is.  I also serve it with salsa to mix it...I really like it with the salsa.  Thanks to Kelley for submitting a great recipe.

We had some friends over for New Years Eve and this was the hit of the evening!  Didn't try it in a crock pot this year, but probably will next time.  The biggest problem with it is that it gets cold.  I was able to pop this back in the oven for a few minutes and still be able to enjoy my friends.  We're considering having friends over for Super Bowl and this is going to be a repeat if that happens.  This appetizer hits a HOME RUN, even if you ARE watching football!

This was great.  Several people complimented me on this.  I sprinkled fajita seasoning on the chicken before baking.  And I also used canned jalapenos and added xtras but I still think it could have used some extra zing.  Next time I will add something like taco seasoning, garlic, onion powder, or the enchilada sauce like others suggested.  After baking, top with chopped black olives and green onions for some color.  Serve with Tostito or Fritos scoops - this dip needs a hearty chip or they will break off.  We used the leftovers rolled in tortillas and it was great that way too.

I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and substituted sour cream for half the mayo and added a can of enchilada sauce. I included the jalapeno, but it still didn't have enough kick, or really even enough flavor. It went over okay, but not great. I'm going to add another can of HOT enchilada sauce when I heat up the leftovers.

Wow!  This one is spicy.  I took it to a bowl party (football) and all of the men ate it in about 15 minutes!  It was the first thing to go.  Next time, I would probably skip the jalepeno, but it was good!  I added some sour cream to the recipe, too.  Excellent!

This dip is great for party's.  The only thing different I did was buy the Short Cuts pre-cook chicken by Perdue, it saved me time. And my guests loved it, they asked for the recipe.

I made the changes recommended in the reviews (less mayo, add sour cream and rotel), but was very dissapointed in the taste.  It definitley had a kick, which I liked, but the taste and presentation was less than appetizing.

Yum!  I used less mayo and 1/2 monterey jack cheese and 1/2 cheddar and leftover grilled chicken.  I also heated it in a mini-crockpot rather than baking the dip.  Everyone loved it.  I did consider adding Rotel tomatoes or enchilada sauce, but am glad that I kept it simple.  We loved it just as is.

As is, my husband gives this five stars. Next time I make it though, I think I'll add a can of rotel to give it a little more spice. We used it as a dip as well as a main course by wrapping the dip in tortillas and adding some lettuce, guacamole, etc.

This was a wonderfull dip! I made it for a pot-luck at work and everyone loved it. They asked me to bring it next time we have another pot-luck! It was easy to make. I cooked it at home, and then heated it back up in the oven at work, it didn't seem over cooked or anything for being cooked twice.

I AM NOT BIG ON CHICKEN ENCHILADAS SO I WILL GO WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE'S REVIEWS ON THIS. THEY SAID IT WAS GREAT. A DEFINITE KEEPER. I WAS PUT OFF BY THE MAYO IN IT SO I ONLY ADDED A LITTLE BIT AND SUBSTITUED WITH SOUR CREAM. I ALSO ADDED A BIT OF SALSA. THERE WAS ONLY FOUR PEOPLE EATING IT THROUGH OUT THE NIGHT(I PUT IT IN MY CROCKPOT) AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE LEFT.

This recipe was very good, but seemed a little bland. Next time I will try 4 oz. mayonnaise and 4 oz. sour cream as some have suggested. I also think topping the recipe with enchilada sauce would be a good idea. I will definitely try this one again.

Great recipe and pretty easy, too. I took it to two parties over the past week and it was a hit. The one change I made was to marinade the chicken in salsa for an hour or so before cooking. Added a tad more spice to the dish.

The entire pan "for 30" was devoured by 7 people in less than half an hour. Definitely better with tortilla chips than crackers, and will be attempting this mixture in flour tortillas for dinner later this week. Thanks for the great recipe, Kelley.

We found this to be too rich and thick for dipping. Nice taste, but I wouldn't do this again.

We made this for a football playoff game party.  Everyone hovered around the dip and no one could stop themselves.  We added onion, garlic cloves, and a chili pepper for extra kick.  Chopping everything including the chicken in a food processor shortened the prep time.  We liked it so much we are making it again for the Superbowl!

I made this dip for a party and it was the hit of the party.  I added a little garlic and onion, plus additonal green chilis.  Put the chicken in the food processor for easy shredding.  Everyone loved it and I have been asked to make this for a New Year's Eve party.

Everyone loved it.  We spread on it crackers, cocktails rye and dipped with tortillas - couldn't go wrong with any of them.  Hotness Hint: If you don't want too much of a kick, eliminate the jalapeno.

Substituting 24 oz. of canned boneless, skinless chicken breast drained and adding taco seasoning to taste really makes this a fast, great dip!  This is called Chicken Chimichanga Dip from my region of the country.

Super - I went with the recommendation for 4 oz mayo and 4 oz sour cream instead of 8 oz mayo. Also, believe it of not the grocery had a morning buy-out on all their  fresh jalapeno's (must have been a restaurant that didn't get their delivery!), so I used 1/2 c pico di gallo (medium heat)...worked great and the added tomato was a nice color addition.   Served with tortilla chips.

I followed the 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Added garlic and seasoned the chicken with cumin, garlic, onion powder and chili powder with lime juice. Baked and boned a chicken to use as the meat. Added black beans, diced green onion and Himalayan pink salt with malabar black pepper fresh ground. Yummy! The photo is a second batch being taken for a football potluck!

It was good but didn't have the zing factor that I expected and had in different recipes. Next time I will make a few modifications.

followed suggestions from 1st review, was a hit!  (marinated chicken in lime juice / taco instead of fajita seasoning and used 4 oz sour cream and 4 oz mayo, topped with black olives when done) will definitely make again, thanks for recipe and other reviews!

I made this yesterday and made a few changes based on other reviews. I used 2 28 oz cans of white meat chicken, a can of hot diced green chilies, half a can of hot diced jalape√±os, half of a packet of fajita seasoning, 4 oz mayo/ 4 oz sour cream and I used chive and onion cream cheese in place of plain cc. Turned out great!

I made the change of 4oz of sour cream for 4oz mayonnaise. I thought the dip was super cheesy and did not care for it. I ended up putting a can of petite diced tomatoes and a tablespoon of chili mix (powdered). I took it to work and it went over well

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have taken it to get togethers on numerous occasions and there is never any left.  I did make a couple of changes.  I was running short on time, so I used canned chicken drained.  I also used 4 oz (1/4 cup) of mayonnaise and 4 oz (1/4 cup) of sour cream.   I have also just heated this in the microwave until hot when I don't want to heat up the kitchen.  I serve it with Tostitos Scoops.  Yummy!

My husband and I are low carb. He loves thick sliced tomatoes baked with tuna fish and cheese topping. I saw this and thought it would be a nice change. I added more chicken to thicken it up. I made it in my toaster oven for him for lunch.... He was totally impressed! He said that I need to have this on hand for him when he has to make his own lunch. I didn't even have to add cheese on the top. Fantastic! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was pretty good.  I made it in the middle of a snowstorm with what was on hand, so I had to make some substitutions.  I used sour cream instead of cream cheese, and spicy pico de gallo instead of green chiles and jalape√±o.  I must say, though, that I cut the amounts for the mayo/sour cream in half and it was still almost too creamy for me.  It would have been way too much if I'd made it as written.  Overall, this is a good recipe :-)

I have been making a variation of this for years.  It is always a hit!  I do make a lot of adjustments. I can't make it with all of the full-fat ingredients because after it cooks,  it has too much visible grease that is not attractive.  To reduce the visible grease, I use reduced-fat cheddar cheese , reduced fat cream cheese, and instead of using eight ounces of mayonnaise, I use four ounces of mayonnaise and four ounces of fat-free sour cream.  I'm not in love with using artificial ingredients, but that beats the sight of grease. I also use one pound of roasted chicken meat.  Because I love the flavor of green chiles, I use a large can of diced green chiles.  I use canned or jarred jalape√±os.  I alter the amount of jalape√±os depending on who I'm feeding.

This was okay.  I used part sour cream, part mayo.  It just didn't have that much flavor, even adding some taco sauce.   I might have had jalapenos that were too mild.

Fantastic... will make again. Substituted 1 tsp chili powder for the jalapenos and used only 1/2 the amount of shredded cheese and mayo. Added 4 oz. of sour cream and 1 Tblsp minced garlic.

I made this with a little modifications- Did not use the diced green chiles- could't find them so I used 1 can well drained Rotel Tomatoes. I also used 2 jalapenos. I seasoned with Adobo with pepper and some Cayenne. We like things hot! This was the hit of the party. So delicious and so easy. Thanks....

Yum!  I took this to our Sunday night small group and it was gone in a flash.  The only thing I modified was the way I cooked the chicken - on our George Foreman grill. This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! For people who say it calls for 16 oz of mayo, it only calls for 8 oz. (1 cup). So I did 4oz low fat mayo and 4oz low fat sour cream. Rotel really added a great kick.

2 slight modifications. Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream like many other posters suggested. Also used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 Monterey jack cheese. Made it twice in 1 week for 2 different pot lucks and it was the first dish gone both times. Everyone loved it from ages 8 to 80. Might just be my new #1 dish to pass.

I made a 1/2 size portion, but kept the full can of chiles...used pre-cooked frozen breast pieces that I thawed in the microwave.  Used sharp cheddar and added a few shakes each of garlic and onion powder, a little cumin and a few dashes of hot sauce.  Simple, fast, yummy!

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it. The first time I made it as directed with the exception of marinating the chicken and using half mayo and half sour cream . The only complaint (if you want to call it that) was it did not have enough kick. Since then I have tweaked it a bit, instead of using fresh jalapenos I use pickled ones, and I have added pepper jack cheese to the mix. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made this for a appetizer contest and got rave reviews! Almost everyone came by to tell me it was great dip and so yummy! I made it a day after so I could have my own for home and I enjoyed it as well. Super easy and very tasty! Made it just as shown -no changes/additions.

This is my go-to recipe for any party!  I do substitute sour cream for the 1/2 of the mayo called for, and Rotel for the green chilis and it is always a huge hit!  For the chicken, I use the pre-cooked Southwest chicken from the meat department which adds some nice spice.  Throw all the ingredients in my stand mixer and it's ready for the oven in no time!

This is a good base recipe, but I cannot imagine eating it without any spices added. I added chili powder, cumin, cayenne, garlic, green onions, salt, and pepper. Used mexican shredded cheese and threw in more than the recipe called for.

Don't fear the mayonnaise!  I considered subbing sour cream, but stuck with the original recipe.  I couldn't taste the mayo at all!  I did think it needed a little more flavor, so I added a little taco seasoning.  The seasoning also gave it a little more color.  I used leftover beer can chicken from the previous day.  I threw everything into the crockpot and was free to get ready for the party while it heated.  In the end, the dip was a big hit, mayo and all.

Made this for the football game and it was a HUGE hit.  Only changes were doing half mayo, half sour cream, added a can of black beans (anytime I can sneak in protein....), and cooking the chicken in enchilada sauce.  Had a good bit of leftovers so I took other's advice and made Enchiladas for dinner tonight just using the leftovers as the filling.  I thought the dip was a hit -- my family couldn't get enough of the Enchiladas!!  This one is definitely on the rotation!!

This was the second time I had made this. The first time was for a baby shower for may boss. That was five years ago and my boss has always commented on how great this was and would I make it again. With Christmas approaching, I decided to make it again for the office.  I should have doubled the recipe since the dish was wiped clean and I had to make copies of the recipe for several people.  This is so wonderful.  I did use 4 oz. mayo and 4 oz. sour cream.  I also used canned chicken (good grade) to make this even faster.  It was wonderful.

This dip was very good however I made it without the jalapeno. I think it needs this. Served it with Fritos corn scoops.

This was a big hit at a get-together!  I used half mayo/half sour cream and added chopped green onions (had on hand).  Instead of fresh jalapeno, I used 2oz. chopped from a small can.  It was so yummy and not too spicy.

This was a huge success and practically inhaled.  Added 1/2 packet taco seasoning, 1/2 mayo/1/2 sour cream, and about 1/2 cup salsa.  Also used pickled jalapenos.

Made this for my Super Bowl party and got great reveiws and was asked for the recipe.  next time I might use 1/2 cup of mayo and a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used pepper jack cheese, added a bit of taco seasoning and also added a bit of green enchilada sauce.  Was delicious with tortilla chips!

This is excellent!  I do half and half sour cream / mayo as mentioned.  I add a can of Rotel with green chiles and a clove of diced garlic.  This tastes good warm or cold.  Serve with Authentic corn tortilla chips or Fritos Scoops. I serve warmed enchilada sauce as a dip to this dip.  Plus jalepeno slices for those who like more heat.

Some reviewers suggested using canned chicken to save on prep time.  I tried this and did not like it -- it gave the dip a very tuna-like flavor.  I would try this again, but with fresh chicken breasts.

This was very good. I used a grocery store rotisserie chicken as a short cut and as another reviewer suggested, I used 4 oz of sour cream and 4 oz of mayo. I also used a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and a little garlic powder. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing

Used poached chicken thoroughly cooled. Added some fresh salsa and fresh cilantro and added half of the mayo and replaced other half with sour cream.  I received so many compliments, will definitely make this again.

EXCELLENT!!! This has been a huge hit for us.  My hubby and I are now expected to take take this when we meet up with out large group of tailgating buddies.  Everyone wants the recipe! The only thing we do differently is add a can of Rotel (drained, and instead of 1 jalepeno pepper, we add a heaping spoon full (maybe two)of diced (drained) jalepeno peppers. We also put a few sliced jalepenos on top in the cheese for looks.  This is the best dip ever!! Thanks for the great recipe!

We LOVED this!!  I made some of the suggested modifications just to lower the calorie count a little, but it didn't affect flavor at all.  We used the leftovers the next day to make some of the best enchiladas I've ever had.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I made this for our Halloween party and when I went to go try it, about five minutes after putting it out, it was all gone.  Everyone loved it.  I made a few changes: first, I browned the chicken in a skillet, then deglazed with 1/2 can of beer and added some taco seasoning.  I reduced the beer down to about 2-3 Tbsp of liquid and added that to the dip.  I also added almost twice as much cheese and omitted the jalapeno because I didn't have one on hand.

This is the most delicious dip. Every time we take this somewhere everybody wants the recipe. My husband has become the master at making it.  Instead of baking the chicken he pan fries it with garlic powder, cajun powder, chili powder, season salt and then of shredding it, he uses the food chopper.  Alot easier.

I made this for the first time for a Valentine's Banquet at church.  I made it with 2 cans of chicken and by mistake only 1/2 of the mayo.  It was still delicious!  Everyone that ate it could only same yum!  It's even been requested for the next church function!

Great recipe!  I took other's advice and cut down on the mayo and added sour cream, I also baked the chicken with taco seasoning on it.  This stuff turned out great!!  I will make it again for the Super Bowl.

Thus was one of may appetizers I made for the holidays and it was a hit! I used canned chicken due to timing issues...added some garlic powder and one more jalapeno(we like more fire in our food!) This was super easy and super tasty! Thanks so much...will be served again super bowl Sunday!!

I made this dip for guests over the weekend, and it was sooo good that people were actually making threats if I didn't give them the recipe.  So beware.. this dip is so good it may cause your guests to loose their minds. I took others advise, and used 4oz mayo, and 4 oz sour cream, and didn't have a scale to measure out 1 lb of chicken, so I used 3 chicken breast halves, and boiled them instead of baking.  YUMMY!!

What a hit!! We all loved it. I did not use mayo but sour cream instead. And I used velveta in place of cheddar because it melts so much better and not oily. I did not use the jalapeno but it was so great without it. My new favorite to take to get togethers!!

This is a complete crowd pleaser.  Try grilling the chicken to just done and tent it for 15 minutes and then use it.  The grilling gives it more flavor.

I have been making this for over 4 years and every time it is gone in minutes!!

I made this dip when it was my turn to host Bunco and I got multiple requests for the recipe.  I did what several others had done--use half mayo/half sour cream and substituted Rotel for the jalapeno and chile peppers.  I serve this with pretzel crisps found in the deli section of my local supermarket.  YUM!

The best hot dip ever!! It's cheesy and creamy. Soooo good! I like to serve it with flour tortillas which I brush with a little olive oil, sprinkle with some salt, then cut into wedges.  I then bake them until they are crispy.  I also bake corn tortilla chips just to warm them up before serving. I can't go to a party without being asked to bring this along!

I'm sorry, but I was extremely disappointed with this recipe.  The dip was stiff and not too cheesy.  I won't be making this again.

I love to change this one up! I don't put green peppers in it, but I always add refried beans. Sometimes I add black beans too. I also usually only use half a can of enchilada sauce, since I don't like it very "spicy"

This was awesome!!! After cooking the chicken I put it in a food processor and it helped make the dip creamier. I make homemade tortilla chips for dipping and it was gone very quick. I will definitely make it again!!!

Sure, this was good, but it could have been a lot creamier and cheesier for me.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and sprinkled everything with garlic powder.

Im not sure what I did wrong but mine came out pretty thick, nothing you could dip your chip into!!  But still, I brought these to a New Years Eve party and everyone loved it, at the end of the night we heated it up again and grabbed forks...I'll definitely try this again though!  Nice and spicy!

Hey this was a big hit at my church Bunko night.  I added a package taco seasonings and also I use some Southwest Chipolte Seasonings from Mrs. Dash.  I did use the canned chilis, so the extra seasoning realy did help improve the taste.

great recipe, and easy to make.. I made a couple of changes.. I added southwest seasoning, lemon pepper, and red pepper to the chicken.  Also, instead of using regular cream cheese, I used fat free cream cheese and it tastes just as good, if not better than the regular version. Also used 2 jalepeno peppers.. This made it nice and spicy!  The original recipe is great too.

Even though this was very rich, it was really bland. I added garlic, cumin and tobassco and it still needed something more. Maybe some dry taco seasoning mix. I followed other suggestions by using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. I also used lower fat ingredients on everything.The crowd I served it to, seemed to like it, but I feel it needs more kick. And it took well over 45 minutes for mine to get brown and bubbly. I probably won't make this again.

I just made this 10/7/06 for my dads b-day party.  My guests who like mild food liked it, but the ones who like FLAVOR didnt really lean toward it.  It lacked SOMETHING.  Flavor, spice, something.  Needs no green chilies b/c come on people, green chilies give NO heat what-so-ever!  Just a green taste...lol....It needs more jalapeno, cayenne, drained Rotel or something, and salt.  Dont make this by recipe if you like SPICE/HEAT in  your food.

This was pretty good although it seemed like the mayo flavor overpowered it a bit. I may try again and adjust the ingredients.

Took this dish to a New Year's Party and it was completely gone in less than an hour. I was lucky to get a little taste.  Didn't change anything but next time I will add just a little more peppers, we like it hot!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a hit! I used some previously mentioned varations of using 2 large cans of chicken, then shredding it and used the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream combo instead of all mayo and used about teaspoon of the canned jalapenos as I didn't have a fresh one on hand.

This was a hit of the party!  I had all the ingredients mixed in a bowl and my husband came by and dipped a chip in it & thought it was great and I hadn't even cooked it yet!  I put it in the slowcooker so it would stay warm.  Excellent dip---Definitely will be making this again & again.

Very good, I thought I had some taco seasoning to add for flavor but was out. A little on the greasy side, but I would make again and add something for more kick.

This was very good.  I made at home for the family to try out using canned chicken and peppers before taking to work for the co-workers on "snack day".  I have to say it was MUCH better 2nd time with using fresh chicken breasts and jalapeno pepper.  I put in a crock pot for work also, and everyone raved on it.

Great dish for parties and to bring to holiday/family functions. I used canned shredded chicken and jalapenos in the jar. It turned out great. It is so easy and tastes great. I will definitely use again.

Great recipe, I've used it over and over.  If you're in a hurry you can boil the chicken. For a variation, use 1/2 pound of chicken and 2 cans of crabmeat.

*didn't personally like using taco seasoning with this, I thought it was best as originally written.  I also recommend that you use fresh jalapeno, and not the canned.

Really good and very very easy when you use canned chicken and jalapenos!! I used 2 large cans of chunk chicken, 2 Tbsp. canned diced jalapenos, and added taco seasoning. Served with a large assortment of crackers and chips. Will make again.

Very very yummy!  I use one large can of chicken breast when in a hurry, and I've also added a drained can of tomatoes with chilis.  It's always a big hit with the men because of the "meat factor".  Serve with Tostitos Gold chips since it's so thick.  Hmmm, it's making me hungry just thinking about it now...

This dip is awesome, I wouldn't change a thing! I am always asked to bring this dip to gatherings and there is never any left over!
To add a little more heat, throw in another jalapeno or two.

I made this for a pool party and it was gone in no time.  This is easy to make ahead and pop in the oven.  I was out of jalapeno peppers so I added hot sauce.  It still added that zip that makes you come back for more.  I already have a request for another batch for a party this weekend.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

The Chicken Enchilada Dip is the best. Easy and fast to make. In place of the baked chicken I will use 2 large cans of chicken and it is just as good. When ever I take it anywhere, everyone wants the recipe.

This was a great recipe - I did add the taco seasoning and can't imagine it being as good without it.  Also used sour cream for part of the mayonnaise, and pepper jack cheese instead of peppers. I also forgot the chiles and added sliced olives. It was very greasy - I used a paper towel to dab off the top, but it was so good.  Got several requests for the recipe from young and old alike.  Very versatile dip.

I made several dips for a party and this was the one that people wanted the recipe to.  It was very easy to make but it took me a little longer than the estimated time to prepare.

This dip was greasy. We could not eat it. I will never make it again. A waste of ingredients.

Fabulous recipe.  I used chili powder for a kick.  It's great with fat-free cream cheese.
I also topped it with Chihuahua cheese before baking.
Awesome!!!

This made up a decent portion, ideal for gathering's. I ended up adding a splash or two of Tobasco sauce. Everyone thought it was tasty.  Will make again.

This recipe is great Kelley! I've been making this dip for the past year. I can no longer go to any get togethers without the dip. The great thing about this recipe is that it is LOW CARB.  I have made a few changes. Sometimes I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I added cumin. If I didn't have jalapenos I used serrano chiles. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

This dip was ok. It was good for something different. It was very rich and not spicy enough for me. I also added some ro-tel and seasoned the chicken with fajita spice before cooking. I prefer the Buffalo Chicken Dip a lot more from this site.

Everytime I make this dish, someone asks for the recipe. I save time by using pre-cooked fajita chicken (when I can find it). I only use a cup of mayo (although I thought thats what 8 oz is..see previous reviews). Serve it with Tostitos lime chips.

The first time I made this recipe was for a boxing fight, before New Years Eve.  It was completely gone.  I was not surprised when I was asked for the recipe for New Years Eve.  When I arrived at the party the first words out of her husbands mouth were, "Thank you for giving my wife this recipe."  His words speak for themself.  Thank you.

I was so excited to make this for a couples X mas party and it was not a hit. I felt that I put a lot of time into shredding chicken for something not that special.It seemed like it was in the oven forever and it still wasn't hot in the middle. It was too rich and salty for my taste I guess. This is the first recipe from allrecipes that I have not cared for. Sorry

I am always looking for new recipes,Mexican dips are our favorites,so gave this one a try.I had to use almost 1 1/2lbs. chicken since where I come from it's hard to find 1 lb. size and I think it affected the texture. I marinated in cajun seasoning before baking and then shredded in food processor as another veiwer stated. I tasted it first with only 1/2c. mayo and thought it was a bit strong and then added 1/2c. sour cream. Followed the rest of recipe as stated. Served to 19 people and only 3 said it was really good. I didn't care for it myself. Others made no comment. I think I would definately try to use only 1 lb. chicken next time and I think the 8 0z. mayo and will add some velveta cheese for creamines.I added 1/4 c enchilada sauce and didn't like the brand I used so it may have affected the taste. I guess I was looking for a creamier texture and would try making again.

It didn't look to appetizing, but once everyone tried it they raved about how good it was. I made it for our Superbowl party. I followed others suggestions and marinated the chicken overnight in mix and then cooked it the next day in a skillet (I added some of the marinade to the pan while cooking it). I also added two cans of chilis and only used half mayo and the other half sour cream. I put it together that morning then refrigerated it - baked it later with some other goodies. I have been asked by my brother to please make this again for a family gathering.

This was an okay recipe.  I used 8oz. mayo and 8oz. sour cream, but the taste of mayo was too evident in the dish.  I probably would not make this again.

Just made this dip for a New Year's Eve party - it was the hit of the party.  I used a previous reviewers idea of using canned chicken.  It really made this fast.  I will probably use "real" chicken next time though, canned chicken is NOT cheap.  GREAT, GREAT DIP ! ! !

I made this dip for a Christmas party and I think just the hostess and I were the only ones eating it.  I really liked it but I think it need some spice to it.  I am going to try the fajita seasoning suggestion and grill my chicken next time.

I made this dip for Christmas & it was delicious.  I used 8 oz mayo & 8 oz of sour cream and omitted the jalapenos.  I did add some Cayenne pepper to the chicken while it was baking, for some kick.  I will definately make this again.

My jalapenos must have been weak, eneded up using 3 to get enough kick. Also added 1 small chopped onion. Took it to a big Christmas potluck. People were actually GUARDING the dish to find out who brought it in so they could get the recipe...I even got a big hug for bringing it!!

This makes an excellent appetizer for potlucks and parties. I used canned chicken and an extra can of chiles. I will definitely continue to make.
Thanks

I am requested to bring this dish everytime I go to a party or outing, and it's gone in minutes!  I like to add a bigger can of the chiles to spice it up.

I took this dish to a card party and everyone loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Someone suggested that this would make a meal and could be wrapped in a tortilla.
