These are the same thing as pigs in a blanket.  Nobody in my family likes them, but I do.  These were great.  Will make again.

These were good but nothing great.  I'm glad I tried them out at home before I brought them anywhere. I don't know...I think I just wasn't crazy about how the cresent dough tasted with the little smokies & cheese. Don't get me wrong...they're not "bad" but just not what I was looking for. At the very least, they're VERY easy to make. My daughter helped roll them up. Thanks anyways.

My son just loves these little finger foods.  I cut weines in half lengthwise and then into fourths, rather than using sausages.  Thanks Kraft!

My mother started making these for me 30 years ago.  It was always a special treat.  I've started making them for my little girl, Rhiannon, and she loves them just as much as her mommy did when she was a little girl.  It's just one of those comfort foods that really takes you back.

My husband and kids LOVE these. I serve them with a quick dipping sauce made from equal amounts grape jelly/barbecue sauce. I always double the recipe. ALWAYS.

These were just okay. Made them for a party and I don't think they went over that well with my guests.

These were pretty good with the cheese, but I much prefer leaving out the cheese, baking them and brushing with a little butter, then dipping them in a mixture of grape jam and Dijon mustard.

These were good, but not flavorful enough for me. I was confused as to whether it would be better to serve them hot or cold, but a good dipping sauce for them would be better. I dont know what that would be, but if anyone has suggestions??

Very good . The cheese is a nice touch. I prefer pigs in a blanket better. The same thing but with little hotdogs.

I made these for our housewarming party along with a lot of other wonderful food from allrecipes.com, and I was surprised to see that these were the first thing that I ran out of. I did use real cheese instead- but I liked them even without the cheese. Great for kids, as they were the first ones to gobble these up.

My family loves these.  Great snack for kids and great finger food for adults.  Sometimes the cheese like to ooze out, so be mindful of that.  My hubby and 4 yr. old love them with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.

I made these for the kids at our halloween party, but the parents ate them quicker than the kids. Thankfully I had extra stuff in the fridge to make more.

My son loves these! He makes them all the time, and while the shape is never quite like what is pictured, they taste great and it's something he can do all on his own.
