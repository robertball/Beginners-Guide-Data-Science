Perfect cooking option for me as I don't like using the broiler. Followed instructions closely and after about 4 1/2 minutes the 1 inch think steak measured 170 degrees. After resting for 4 minutes the result was a perfect medium rare steak, my favorite. You might want to play with the timing a bit but definitely give this recipe a try.

Interestingly enough,I have a cookbook called "Mrs. Rorer's New cookbook"....1898.It was a gift from my mom.This is almost how to cook steaks in a hot cast iron skillet.In a well seasoned skillet-no oil is needed,it just has to be very hot.The process allows the meat to cook in it's own juices and then turned frequently so rather than sit and 'fry' or 'boil' -it evaporates and you get a 'crust' as it were....thanks to the cook who posted.

This is a great way to cook steaks. I used top sirloin steaks and added freshly ground black pepper and the sauce from the Minute Steaks with Barbeque Butter Sauce recipe.
They were the best steaks I have ever had!

I love the idea and it worked somewhat ok.  I had 1 inch strips.  I ended up flipping for almost 7 minutes before they got to medium.  I also think 3 tablespoons is way too much oil as i didn't get a very good sear until removing some of the oil on later steaks.
