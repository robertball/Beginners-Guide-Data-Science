I am the submitter of this recipe. I add a PINCH of salt.  And I always put in 3 T Hazelnut spread. I always top it with ice cream or fudge if I have some around! I hope this helps and clarifies things!

My oldest boy and I made this together last night. We made no changes or substitutions. I did make sure to spritz my mug a little with non stick cooking spray before I added the cake ingredients. We topped the "cake" with a little Cool Whip before we dug in. Both of us really enjoyed this.  Great quick pantry dessert.

while this is a great mug cake, it's too salty in the batter. It tasted more like a brownie then a cake on the 1st round and it rose soo high I thought it was going to explode all over the microwave....trust me I was laughing at it. 2nd cup I made, I omitted the salt all together. And it was way way better....still rose over the cup, so I put it in a soup mug the 3rd time....yes I made this 4x in one night, 3 of my kids and hubby got all excited over it. And loved watching it bake soo quickly in the microwave. TY but won't be making it again with the added salt. Taste way better without it.

Very yummy!!!  I didn't have self rising flour so I added a little more than 1/8 tsp of baking powder and reduced the salt to 1/8 tsp.  The cake wasn't very sweet but we ate it with ice cream and it was perfect.  I will make this more often.  Just the right amount to take care of my chocolate craving.  Keeps me from over eating.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is pretty good, but I'm going to have to experiment with the cook time a little before I find it delicious! I cooked it the full 2 1/2 min., and I think that was too long.  It reminded me of a muffin in taste and in texture, which wasn't bad, but I want it to be more of a moist, barely cooked kind of taste! No self rising flour, so I used all-purpose flour and added 1/4 tsp. baking powder. Out of nutella, so I used unsalted peanut butter and also subbed coconut oil for veg. oil.

Recipe was great in that it had all ingredients that I have in the house.  When adding the salt I questioned the amount but followed the recipe. It was way too salty.  I made it with PB which may have also added to the saltiness.  I topped with vanilla ice cream which helped, but still could only eat about 1/4 of it.  I would try it again without the salt.

Super easy and fast and moist and delicious.  I made it following the recipie exactly and topped it with some vanilla ice cream.  It made it taste like a chocolate cake/brownie sunday.  I don't think the Nutella is a must have; I think you could make it into a regular chocolate cake and it would still be delicious.

This is the first mug recipe that I have tried that tastes like actual cake. It is pretty yummy and definitely satisfies a chocolate cake craving. I would maybe use a bit less salt in the future, as it is on the salty side.

Moist cake.  Rich flavor.  I was hoping for a little more goo, so next time I am adding a bit more nutella :)  I also tried it without salt as many others suggested, but I am going to just add a pinch next time so you have that balance.  My only complaint is, how big of mugs do you guys have?!?  This recipe is for extra large coffee mugs I guess.  I ended up just mixing it in a cereal bowl because I knew it wouldn't fit in my regular mugs.  A great dessert size with ice cream for me and my Sweetie.  Also, for people who don't like the hazelnut taste add some hot fudge instead or peanut butter as many others suggested.  All yummy.

My husband and I wanted something sweet last night so tried this.  I didn't have self rising flour so used regular flour and added 1/4 tsp baking powder.  I did taste the salt--but I liked it that way--you could take it out if you don't like that much....self rising flour usually already has salt in it.  We also poured it into 2 ramekins and cooked both at the same time so we each had our own.  We were both surprised that it was completely cooked in the middle.  It hit the spot!  This would be great with peanut butter too!

This is a very very good recipe. Very forgiving, when it comes to the amounts of ingredients as well. Since I make this with my almost 6 year old son, it is hard to get the exact measurements. He generously dumps the nutella, and it still tastes great. We bake it in individual ramekins, just to avoid fights over who gets the last bite. Thank you for an awesome easy recipe.

Wow! My daughter loved it! Followed reviews that to use only a pinch of salt, and 3 tablespoons of Nutella. Also, used all purpose flour and 1/8 tsp baking powder. Used a soup mug and took about 2 minutes to cook to our liking. Added vanilla icecream! Husband also said best mug cake he ever had.

I subbed buttermilk for regular milk and doubled the recipe to make 2 mugs.  I was generous with the sugar and Nutella. I might cut it down to just a pinch of salt next time but I was SO glad I used large mugs and only filled halfway. Look how far this blew up! Will definitely grease the mugs next time. Cleanup will be a disaster.

Very good recipe! The cake was nice and moist. The title says single serving but next time I would half the recipe; it overflowed from the mug and landed on the microwave plate! It's a huge amount of cake.

Making it I used just a pinch of salt, added about a half tsp of cinnamon, and cut the oil to about 2 1/2 tbsp and it was still very moist. My biggest change was that I halved the sugar; no one needs that much! It was still extremely sweet. Seriously. You don't need all that sugar.

Ate it with a bit of whipped cream on top for a delicious midnight snack! Would make again for sure!

This was way toooooo salty. It should probably only call for a pinch of salt. Will have to try it again with less salt. I couldn't eat it. What a shame. Recipe should be corrected as a lot of people have complained about the same thing.

Oh Yum! I didn't have Nutella or peanut butter (weird...)so I smashed two tablespoons worth of macadamia nuts into paste and mixed it in. Everything else was left exactly as stated in the recipe, and it turned out fabulously! Perfect for when I'm craving a bit of a sinful home-made sweet, but don't have the energy or patience to bake :)

I added a spoonful of powdered sugar and cooked it for 1 1/2 minutes and it was perfectly cooked with a little bit of gooey to mix with every bite!

Hubby made last night & one mug makes enough for 2 people. You can use regular flour if you add 1/8 tsp baking powder which is what he did. He did say that next time he'll mix it in a bowl & then pour into a mug cause it would be easier to stir. Wipe the mug with oil so it doesn't stick.

If I had not added salt to make self-rising flour, and had omitted salt from the recipe, it probably would have been good. Would like to try again without salt. I was amazed the consistency was perfect but taste was all salt.

Awesome!!! My 9 year old made it with my supervision. We followed  the recommendations and used a pinch of salt, 3 tablespoons of Nutella and 3 tablespoons of cocoa. We will most definitely make this again! Vanilla  ice cream just takes it over the top!

This is by far the best mug cake I have tasted. I had to use vanilla yogurt instead of milk though because I had no milk but it was still delicious. Recommend!

WORST MUG CAKE RECIPE I'VE EVER USED. I've made a lot of different mug cakes and I have never had one turn out like this one did. I couldn't find my usual Nutella mug cake recipe so I decided to try this one out. I use a slightly larger than standard mug to cook mug cakes in and this one still exploded out of the mug after only a minute. It hadn't even cooked properly. There were some small bits that had cooked with lots of uncooked batter throughout. I measured out all the ingredients exactly according to the recipe so I'm not sure why it didn't work or why it rose up so quickly and went all over the microwave. The only thing I can think of is that this recipe uses self-rising flour and not all purpose flour like some other Mug Cake recipes I've used. I Really didn't think a raising agent was particularly necessary for this recipe, but I always try to follow the recipe instructions. also some one really needs to edit the cook time, title, and amount of salt!! The title says 5 minute mug cake and the cook time also says 5 minutes but then the last line of the cooking instructions say 1 1/2 to 2/12 minutes?! I didn't notice this last line until afterwards and thankfully I didn't actually cook it for 5 minutes otherwise I would have had an even bigger mess to clean up. I hate wasting food so this was a big disappointment.

I also added a pinch of salt and three TBS of Hazelnut spread.  In place of sugar I used 1 TBS of granulated maple syrup ( I'm from VT) and the cakes were a hit!

I loved it!!!  I found out it was National Chocolate Cake Day and I was craving a chocolate cake!!  And I love Nutella!!  Since I only needed a small chocolate cake I decided a mug cake was in order.  I had all the ingredients on hand - even the Nutella!  Followed the recipe, but used just a small pinch of salt after reading the other reviews.  I also used 2 Tbl Nutella in the batter, but spooned another tablespoon of Nutella in the center of the batter before microwaving (hoping for a lava cake affect?).  Microwaved 1-1/2 minutes, which was perfect.  And although the Nutella dollop sank to the bottom of the mug, it was still a yummy gooey surprise at the bottom of the cake.  I will definitely be making this again!!

Reduce the salt to a pinch (maybe a 1/4 tsp). Go for 3tbsp Nutella. Don't over micro!! This was so easy to make and the whole family loved their mug cakes. Hit the spot tonight.

I thought this was great recipe. I used a pinch of salt, as opposed to the 1/2 teaspoon. I will make this again, but will add more Nutella and cocoa next time to give it more flavor. Overall, it was a great recipe. I also used an oversized mug to prevent a mess in the microwave.

It turned out great!!! Of course I added a few of my own ingredients. No self rising flour so used regular flour with a quarter teaspoon of baking powder.also did not have Nutella so used chocolate peanut butter and a heaping tablespoon s of marshmallow cream YUM. I believe it gave the cake the fudge consistency that some were looking for in the recipe. I did not use all the salt the recipe said but a pinch did well. I can't wait to try other variations of this.

Lovely moist texture, perfectly chocolatey too. One of the best recipes.
Unlike a few of the reviewers, I only used a pinch of salt (y'know, common sense). What would I have changed? It exploded all over the (large) mug, overspilled and made a mess of the microwave. 
Tasty enough for me that this was only a minor flaw. :P

I thought this was pretty good! I didn't have self rising flour so I used regular flour and added a 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I upped the Nutella to 3 T and omitted the salt. Also I didn't have milk so I used my coffee creamer. This was pretty darn good! I think it does need a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor so I will do that next time. This would also be a good cake to add melting chocolate pieces in the middle to make a molten lava version. :)  This was a very easy, no fuss, quick way to get a warm yummy dessert.

For what it is, it's pretty good. It needs more chocolate flavor and I might add more vanilla next time. I didn't have self riding flour, so I added 1/8tsp baking soda. Other additions include leaving out the salt and just adding a pinch and 3 tbs of Nutella. I might give this one more go and see if I can make it more chocolatey. Maybe chocolate chips?

This is the first mug cake I've made that actually had a cake texture versus a sponge texture. I didn't add the salt, but added an extra tablespoon Cocoa powder and 3 heaping tablespoons of Nutella. It has to be cooked in a large soup style mug or latte bowl and is more than enough to share with my hubby!!! Love this recipe!!

The best microwave chocolate mug cake I've tried so far! Cut the salt down to about 1/8 tsp as 1/2 tsp seemed like a lot, mixed the whole thing in a soup mug (about 2 cup capacity) and had no spills at all - really good!

This is delicious! The 2 servings this recipe makes are more like 3 or 4 servings (at least for me), and I highly recommend you use an oversized mug if you're making a single serving.

Came out surprisingly moist. I've tried other recipes in the past that came out dry and didn't taste very good. I would make some tweaks next time but definitely would try it again.

I made this recipe for my two kids Tokyou and Kramig who absolutely loved it!

We will be making many many more of these over the next few weeks I'm sure!

Thank you so much for the recipe.

I found this was really rubbery and had too much of an eggy taste. Maybe next time I'll omit the salt like another review said. I did find it had more of a brownie texture and wasn't very sweet either, I guess I just like my food REALLY sweet.

Me and my little brother made this.. It was a really fun quick and easy to make! But I ruined it by adding a half tablespoon of salt.. And maybe add a couple more tbs of Nutella for more flavor.. But if I didn't ruin it, it would have been really good.. And it took like three minutes in my microwave.. ??????????

I made this gluten free by using Pamela's baking mix. It came out a little salty for a cake, but otherwise it was moist and had good flavor. I will try cutting the salt in half next time.
I topped it with home made whipped cream mixed with nutella, which helped balance the salt flavor a little.
