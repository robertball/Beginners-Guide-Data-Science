I used this recipe for inspiration.  I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose and used a vinegar-soy milk combination instead of buttermilk.  This bread definitely needed a well floured surface to knead on!!!  I kept the bread whole instead of quartering before putting on the frying pan.  This produces a fine crumb bread, and was delicious!

Way too much flour. I used 2 and 1/4 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 egg 1 cup of buttermilk and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. Instead of oil, melted butter is a must.

I have never made this. But our family recipe is very similar. 
Our family recipe used 4 cups of flour. We would cook the bread on all sides for app 30 minutes per side. Once cooled, we sliced it in app 1/2 inch slices and fried in bacon fat( medium high heat just until it started to brown) and served with bacon and eggs. This version can be frozen for an extensive period.
