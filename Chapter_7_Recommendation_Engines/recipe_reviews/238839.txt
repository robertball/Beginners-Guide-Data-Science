This is called a slab pie but I am not sure if it should be classified a cake. It is really somewhere in between! I followed the recipe exactly and it was good. I will make it again but may add nutmeg to the dough. It was a little dry at first but moistened up the second day.

Yes, it was easy but my cake turned out really dry.   I should've watched it really closely since the batter was so thin.

Delicious.  Followed instructions, using gala apples.  Cake was delicious but the crumble top wasnâ€™t so crumbly, albeit delicious!  Would make again.

After reading the reviews here I decided to make an  icing sugar glaze.  I used a rum flavoring instead of vanilla.  This counter acted the dry crust perfectly as mentioned. Kept it refrigerated all times.  It was delicious and will be making again.

Tasted very good but I agree with the other reviews that it is a little dry. Delicious though, tempted to drizzle some powdered sugar icing on top.
