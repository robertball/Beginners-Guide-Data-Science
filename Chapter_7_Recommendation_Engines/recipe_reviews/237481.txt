A delicious breakfast this morning! It might not have been necessary, but I ground the oats a little first. I subbed unsweetened almond milk for the low-fat milk (which I assumed meant skim) and I used Chobani non-fat strawberry Greek yogurt. Then I added everything else. Smooth and creamy!

This was a great evening snack.  I only had vanilla yogurt but, everything else was there.  It was very tasty and easy to put together.  Will definitely make this again.

I forgot the oats and vanilla but it was excellent this way.  One of my favorite smoothies and I make a lot of them.
