We used this recipe for rolled out cookies. I baked them for 11 minute- I took them out before they started to brown,as we wanted super soft cookies. They came out great. The dough held its shape well, and didnt require chilling before rolling and cutting. I found it very easy to work with.  I sprinkled one pan with cinnamon and sugar before baking- they were great! The kids used frosting on some of them. Since they are not super sweet on their own, the frosting isnt to much. edit to add: we've made this recipe a few times now. Its even better if you add the zest of one medium orange. It gives them a bit more flavor.

Absolutely wonderful!  Be sure to cream the butter, shortening, and sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy before proceding to next step.  This will make a big difference.  Also, it helps to chill the dough before rolling into balls.  This is the best sugar cookie I've ever tasted!  It's a keeper!

I couldnt believe how delicious and soft these cookies came out! I was soo undecided on which cookie recipe to go with, but I went with my gut on this one, and Im so glad that I did.  Because they turned out sooooo delicious.  I rolled them into good size balls, then dropped the tops of them in some pink sugar crystals, and flatened the top with a glass, baked for 8 mins, and they were perfect, THANKS!

I enjoyed this recipe. There was nothing really spectacular about the flavor. It tasted like a normal sugar cookie. The texture however, was fantastic. It yielded nice soft cookies than browned perfectly in 10 minutes. The sugar on the outside gave a crunchy coating that contrasted beautifully with the soft centers. I also enjoyed how easy this recipe was to make. I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I just used butter, but they still came out very nice.

I used to love the sugar cookies they had in the Mall (at $2 a cookie!) because they were always soft...on my 1st try with this recipe, they turned out better than those mall cookies. A must try!

Very easy to make!  I use margarine for the shortening. 
They remind me of Lofthouse cookies-only a little smaller.
I make a glaze with powdered sugar, milk, and a little vanilla (and some fun food coloring) to glaze these. You can add sprinkles at this point also. Kids LOVE them.  I've been bringing them in for school b-day parties (and the teachers like them too!).

I just made these and, after reading all of the reviews, I should give my input as well... I gave these only 4 stars because of misleading directions. The recipe implies that these cookies will spread to give the classic sugar cookie shape. This is completely untrue. If you roll them as written an place them on your cookie sheet, that's exactly what you will get when you take them out ten minutes later - a great tasting cookie ball. If you use your fingers to press them down, you'll end up with nice little impressions of your fingers. The taste and texture ARE fantastic (I followed exactly as written - except for not rolling in sugar since I plan on frosting mine) BUT you must dip the bottom of a glass in some fine sugar and then use this to press down your cookies. That's the only way to get the desired shape. Any imperfections when going into the oven will be seen when the cookies come out, so if you don't like ragged edges on your cookie - reshape with your hand while on the cookie sheet before going into the oven. And, yes, I did these large and small size - still needed to be pressed down and shaped by hand for looks. Definitely try this recipe for a wonderful taste and texture, but know that the directions are leading you astray when it comes to how to get the desired cookie...

These are just excellent.  I made them exactly according to the recipe and they got rave reviews and disappeared quickly.  I thought they were going to spread out and they didn't, so they are high cookies, not flat ones.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These cookies are great!  I also made them without rolling in sugar and then frosted them - very yummy!  They turned out soft and irresistable!  They taste as good as our family traditional cutout sugar cookies, except you don't have to roll and cut out!  Definite keeper.

Wow - these cookies are amazing!  They mixed up easily and well and sat nicely on the sheet.  My oven needed 15 minutes 
to get them just right.  The texture, color and flavor are all excellent.
I noted that some other reviewers had some issues with rolling these out - these are listed as a drop cookie and perhaps not intended to be rolled out.  If you are looking for a quick to the oven tasty cookie that you can count on, look no further.

soft and yummy..great when frosted.  I, too, Get so tired of people giving poor reviews, when the fault is their own..Sorry, but you chose to substitute ingredients.  I also love these people who write a novel with a review.."We get it, you know how to cook/bake".  Plain and simple, if you follow directions and use ingredients as listed, you will find these little gems delightful..

Made these and they would have been great.  One small problem,.... I forgot to put in the Vanilla Extract.  Soo, I guess you know how that turned out.  Yeah.  However every part of the process was really easy.  Im going to try again this weekend.

Dont you hate it when someone gives a review of less than 5 stars and then goes on to say they didnt have all the ingredients so they substituted butter for shortening?... I found these cookies to be great. They baked up nice and soft. I will keep this recipe and use it from now on.

Waaay too much salt. Very disappointing. I had a feeling it was too much when I put it in. Should have  trusted my instincts. If I make this again, I will only use half a teaspoon.

I was looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe to compliment my homemade Jams & Jellies.  This was it!  I used my cookie press, made a small indentation in the center, and added my peach, apple, blackberry, loganberry, pear and cherry preserves.  They are even better the second day!  So soft and chewy...  When I used my spiced preserves, I even added a little cinnamon to the mix to accent the spices, YUM!
Thank you Laura, for such a great recipe!

I have made these a few times now. The first time, I made them exactly per instructions, and since then I have made them substituting the vanilla for a variety of extracts, they have always turned out perfect :D 1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract and frosting with peppermint icing work out perfectly for a holiday treat. except now I am expected to make at least 3 double batches of them every December lol

These are great little cookies. My kids and I had a blast making them. I didn't change anything, we rolled up about 1 in. balls and flattened them a little in our palms then sprinkled with red and green sugar, baked exactly 12 mins in my oven. *A little baking tip when using stick butter 12 Tbsp = 2/3c. and 14 Tbsp = 3/4c.* Thanks for the recipe.

I usually use less salt than recipes call for and after reading a review that said less salt might be better, I opted to use 1/2 tsp rather than the recipes's called for 1 tsp. The only other change I made was using about 3 cups flour rather than 3 1/2 cups.  Reason for this was my hand blender started smelling like the motor was burning out when I got to 3 cups, so I turned it off-finished blending the batter by hand.  I baked 10 min at 350, the bottoms were golden the top part of cookie still very pale.  Finished by topping with a butter-powder sugar frosting. For quality assurance, I promptly ate 5 in a row to make sure my review was accurate.  These cookies need one more thing not mentioned in the recipe:  a large glass of cold milk.  Bringing in a dozen of these to my fav co-worker today so I don't eat them all.  Really good cookies.  Fluffy light soft. Nice.
UPDATE:  Test drove this recipe replacing the shortening with organic coconut oil with good results. Expensive, but flavorful and healthy. To anyone wondering, yes, you can replace shortening with coconut oil, organic or refined. I make these cookies almost weekly now. Any version of recipe is good.

Needed to add more sugar for our tastes.  The cookies were great when they came out but after they had cooled I could taste the shortening in them....

This is just what I was looking for!  The cookies are delicious!  I did use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, and the flavor was wonderful.  The dough is soft when forming into balls, but using a gentle hand worked fine.  I baked them with and without pressing the balls down slightly with the bottom of a glass, and liked the results better using the glass.  If you are a sugar cookie lover like me, this is the recipe for you!

I've made these cookies for my family at Christmas for the last few years.  I thought it was time to post some tips for those who may have encountered problems with this recipe.

You can scale this recipe up to 36 servings to avoid the odd measurements of butter and shortening.  Or, you can scale it down to as little as 12 servings.

I always chill the dough for 1 hour before baking.  Any longer than that and the dough will get too cold, too hard, and the cookies will be raw in the middle (The tops/centers should look pale and white).  If the centers look wet or grey, they're underdone.

After rolling the balls of dough into an additional amount of sugar, you must flatten them (to an even thickness) using the bottom of a 1/4 or 1/8 cup measuring cup.  If you don't, they will not bake all the way through in the center.

If your dough is closer to room temperature, bake the cookies for 8:45.  If the dough is colder and firmer, bake for 10 minutes.

If the dough cracks or crumbles when you try rolling it into balls, it is a sign that the dough may be slightly dry.  To offset this, add a tiny amount of milk, water, or canola oil to your hands and pat the dough softly until it seems fully moistened (and does not crack or crumble when rolling it into balls).

On the flip side, if the dough seems too sticky or wet after mixing, add enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands before refrigerating.

I hope this helps.

I like the taste of the cookies but mine weren't airy enough.  I had to really roll them to get the dough to stay together.  I will probably take 1 minute off my cooking time as well because my edges got a little crunch.

I am not a huge sugar cookie fan, but these blew my socks off! And my husband and daughter both loved them. They are indeed soft in the middle and delightfully crunchy on the outside when baked correctly, and the taste is just what one expects from a sugar cookie.  I don't really consider it a deviation from the recipe, but I used butter-flavored shortening. Otherwise I left all the ingredients the same.  The recipe instructions didn't call for it, but I did chill my dough overnight before rolling and baking. This was a great help in handling the dough, and it doesn't seem to have hurt the cookies at all.  I rolled mine in a mixture of "Raw Sugar" and colored sugars. The cookies were attractive and delicious at the same time.  This recipe will remain in my recipe box; it's rare that I find a sugar cookie I actually like. Next year I may try icing!

These are fantastic!  Easy to make and they are not too sweet. I rolled half the batch in cinnamon sugar and they were great.

Very, very good. Used all butter since I did not have any shortening on hand. Soft cookies with almost a cake-like consistency. Will be keeping this recipe on hand when I want to bake a quick easy cookie.

So delicous and easy. You must add orange zest it makes a huge difference.

This is a 10 star recipe!  I have made these many ways, rolled and cut, thick, thin, and I always make them as written first.  To top them I have used sugar, canned frosting and hard icing.  They stay soft for days no matter how you store them.  When I ice them they have to stay out to harden the icing and they are still soft even after 4 or 5 days!  Just do not rolls them too thin and do not refigerate the dough overnight.  It is a very soft dough but rolls easily.  Refigerate for maybe 1/2 hr. if the dough is too soft.  I have also found that I like the larger cookies better than the small ones (probably because they taste so good!)  =)

These cookies are so easy to make and is very forgiving! I did not have enough shortening but after reading several reviews, I went ahead and made them with all butter. They still turned out light and soft. I am not a huge sugar cookie fan but my family likes them. After mixing the dough, I decided I would like it a little sweeter. I added about 1/4 cup more sugar. This is my personal taste and does not mean the recipe as stated is off. I just don't like icing so prefer to up the sugar in the dough to compensate.  I rolled into balls dipped in colored sugar and then flattened with a glass. My oven runs a little hot so I cooked them 9 minutes, cooled on pan one minute and then moved to cooling rack. Perfect.

This is a fantastic recipe and very easy. I used a buttercream frosting on top as well. DO NOT overbake. My first pan I left in until they were light light golden brown on the bottom and now they are toothchippers. They were fine while they were hot but after cooling, impossible to eat. The next pans turned out picture-perfect. Thanks for the keeper!

I actually didn't mind these cookies. They were okay. Not a single person in my family liked them however. Not even my young son. They all said they taste like, "Dough balls."   I think the recipe might need to lay off the flour a bit.

Great Recipe! Im baking the 2nd batch now. Very soft and very easy and cheap to make. Will make again, and again. Almost forgot to add: I only had 1 tsp. of vanilla extract instead of two and still came out Great! Thank You!

Seriously these are the best sugar cookies.  I do use almond sometimes instead of vanilla extract, just a flavor preference.  I use an ice cream scoop to drop the cookies, then use my 1 cup measure to press flat.  They look just like rolled cookies without the mess and trouble.  Yum.  Thanks!!

I'm a real cookie snob (especially sugar cookies), so it's hard to please me. These cookies are fantastic! The dough was easy to mix and work with. They came out soft and sweet. The only change I made was to half the vanilla (so I only put in 1 tsp instead of 2). I highly recommend this recipe.

These cookies were good! It was not what I was looking for, but that wasn't the recipe's fault. Everyone liked them, and this recipe yielded a lot as well! I ended up with over 60, and they were decent size. They looked exactly like the pictures too! I think I will be making this recipe again.

I followed this recipe to the letter. They were indeed soft, delicious, and a very easy recipe from start to finish. I used them as the base for the 'melted snowman' cookies and they were perfect.

Excellent sugar cookies!  Very buttery tasting and very soft. Not flavorless like the ones you buy in the grocery store bakery, but just as soft and light.  I also like that it doesn't call for any ingredients I may not have on hand all the time like sour cream or cream of tarter.

Just FYI:  I wanted a recipe to make cut-outs, but I found this dough a bit mushy for that, even after chilling a while.  so if you want to make cut out cookies for decorating instead of rolled in sugar as in the recipe, I'd add an additional cup of flour.  Even with that flour, these cookies were soft and very tasty and turned out perfect as Valentines hearts.

Did not really care for the taste. You could taste the shortening and the salt. This was even through the frosting I put on them. Will be looking for another sugar cookie recipe to try.

The cookies didn't flatten out at all and didn't cook.  Must be why they are so soft.  The flavor of the cookie was not good. I don't know if there is an ingredient missing or what.  I was sheer disappointment.  My advice, pick another recipe!  Wish I could rate no stars!

I chose to make these with my 3 year old rather than the roll out kind.  The roll out cookies can be a pain with little kids.  He loved rolling the balls and "dip, dip. plop" with the sprinkles (dip into sprinkle, dip again, plop onto pan).  We used a ruler for spacing so he could learn about measurements.  The cookies turned out wonderful-couldn't ask for anything easier.

The softest most delicious sugar cookie ever the flavor by themselves isn't quite right but just a little icing and they are better than any you'll find in a bakery.  A bit on the sweet side one or two are the most I'd eat at once.

Well...with all the great reviews, I thought this would be "the one".  Unfortunatly, I was a little off.  Let me start by saying I followed the recipe exact.  I had a hard time getting the dough to come together.  When I baked them, they didn't hardly rise at all.  I had a little difficulty in knowing when they were done and had to break a couple of them apart to check. Unfortunatly, about an hour after they cooled, my son tried to eat one and threw it away because it was too hard.  This recipe was a bust for me.  Like I said, I followed the recipe exact and for some reason it just didn't work.  Needless to say, I am still looking for the best soft sugar cookie.

As my great-grandmother used to say, sugar cookies bring out the best flavors of tea by not competing with it!  So, don't expect this recipe to produce a highly-flavored cookie.  Instead, enjoy them with tea. :)  While my G-G'ma made the traditional crispy sugar cookie, I tried this recipe because my husband prefers soft cookies.  I tried patting out the dough and using cutters (my 2.5 year old was helping), but it wasn't firm enough -- next time I'll try refrigerating the dough for a while.  Even as drop cookies, these are enjoyable and oh so soft!  I bet they'll be perfect with tea!

These are very easy, but I would reduce the sugar to 1 cup and use all butter instead of shortening.  VARIATION:  use all butter, substitute brown sugar for white, and roll in cinnamon sugar before baking.  Yummy!  I also mixed 1 1/2 cups wheat flour into the all-purpose to make the 3 1/2 cups.

These are the perfect, easy, no roll, no chilling necessary sugar cookie.  The dough took minutes to prepare and they were easy to roll into different sugars and decors.  And.....they taste sooooo good.  I mean, this is one cookie that I have to tell myself to stop eating, but they are worth every bite.  I will want to make this recipe often, but may have to refrain just to keep myself from eating the whole batch.

These are great!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I rolled these out and made them into the traditional circles.  I did not refrigerate and I had NO issue at all rolling them out.  The dough stayed together nicely, and there's enough butter & shortening that they don't stick to the counter or rolling pin! Baking them on parchment paper keeps the bottoms from getting too brown.  Mine were ready in 10 minutes.  Easy!

These cookies were soft! I kinda wanted my cookies to turn out like the picture. Some said the cookies don't expand. But my did which was why I was kinda disappointed they came out a little flat. THe first time I made the cookies I used butter instead of shortening. And they spread alot and the dough was sticky bad for cut out cookies but came out soft though. The second time I used  vegetable oil to substitute shortening and the dough was less watery and I think I had it in the refrigerator at least an hour or so could be used for cut out cookies. I had no trouble rolling the second batch into a ball using my hands. but the first batch man I needed alot of flower. The first batch was salty and kinda sweet it was like first taste was sweet then came the salt. And could have been from the butter. So the second time I didn't add salt and add an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Was sweet maybe kinda too sweet but in a way expected taste from a sugar cookie. I dont know if I should buy a tub of shortening for this recipe. But hands down you want a soft cookie this is it.

I never like to do bad reviews, but this was not good. I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out awful. They did not flatten out at all, and they tasted just like biscuits. I would definitely not recommend these, and I will continue to find a better recipe.

These sugar cookies are so awesome!  A little crispy on the outside and soft/fluffy on the inside.  I used all butter, instead of shortening (personal preference) and they turned out great.  As is, I thought they could actually use a little more sugar, but I put some vanilla frosting on the cookie and it was perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Although they were too soft to easily make cut-out cookies, they were delicious. I frosted them with buttercream frosting.

These cookies turned out amazing, but I did make a few changes.  I added an extra egg and a tiny bit of extra flour, probably not even 1/4 cup.  I will definitely be making these again!

These were delicious! I didn't have any white sugar left to roll them in, so I used brown. It gave it a nice flavour and pretty colour. I will be making these again.

So I just made these cookies and they are so freaking delicious. I couldn't believe how perfect they were. I can't wait for my husband to wake up to try them. The only complaint I have it that they remained ball-like after they baked. Next time I'm going to press them down a bit. Still, this is the perfect sugar cookie.

This recipe was awful.  This recipe came out so salty it tasted like playdough. 1 t. of salt, and 2 t. of baking powder seems like a lot, did I do something wrong??

I just made this recipe three times for my husband and his employees. They said they were the best cookies they have ever had. I used 2 sticks of butter though instead of the shortening because I didn't have any. I also added Hersey caramel and almond kisses on top of each cookie.I love the fact I didn't need to roll out or chill the dough and they turned out really good! Now just have to figure out how I can keep my kids from sneaking off with the ones I just now made.

The texture of this cookie is fantastic.  I have to agree with some of the others that it is a little bland.  I will add a little extra salt next time, some butter extract, and continue like I did this time with a light citrus glaze.  Pretty tasty!  Edit:  unlike most cookies, this was even better the next day.  It was ridiculously tender and just everything you could hope for in a cookie.

This is such a flexible recipe. I use all butter and sometimes brown sugar. I've tried lots of different versions: 1 tsp of cumin; brown sugar and cinnamon, a Tbsp of lavender, grated citrus zest. They all came out delicious.

THESE COOKIES WERE PERFECT! I followed the recipe exactly, and they were amazing. They didn't flatten out, and they were very moist and thick and chewy! I think the perfect time to keep them in the oven is exactly 10 minutes. They were delicious! I made 30 cookies, and they were gone in 2 days! Although that may have been because I had 4 hungry boys in the house! (:

Delicious! The key is to make the cookies thicker and do not cook them till they are brown. Take them out of the oven when they are just starting to brown. They will cool nice, soft and chewy!

This recipe does not seem correct. I tried to prepare these cookies, but the recipe doesn't call for any type of liquid, and also the (white sugar) is a very vague ingredient.  It calls for (white sugar AND grandulated sugar.  No specificity.

Excellent cookie.  So soft and good.  Definitely cream the butter/shortening and sugar WELL before adding the other ingredients.  Frosted with the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe from this site and the cookies were gone by the end of the day.  Seriously.

First time i made them, these cookies turned out exceptionally well.  I read all the reviews and decided this cookie recipe was th eone.  I am not one to go out of my way to actually review recipes but this one I could not stay away from.  Some tips i learned from reading the earlier reviews is that it's important to make sure you mix well and chill the dough in the fridge for 5-10 minutes.  I also used vegtable oil shortening which helped with the dough.  Best sugar cookie EVER!

Great recipe.  I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract and they were great.  Be careful not to overbake.

These cookies are absolutely wonderful! I am eating one now as I write this review, almost one week later. They keep so well, but I have also been using the bread trick (tear off a piece of bread and stick in your cookie container and it will keep them soft). This was my first attempt ever at sugar cookies and this dough is perfect for rolling out if you do so at about 1/2" thick. I roll my dough between 2 pieces of saran wrap which makes it so much easier and less messy. I also used the Sugar Cookie Icing by JBS BOX on this site and it was the perfect complement. My pet peeve is hard sugar cookies and these are so unbelievably soft! This is my go-to recipe for sure!!

I am making these cookies right now.  They are just fabulous. Very easy to make and a wonderful soft buttery flavor.  I dipped some in colored sugar for Christmas and I am going to frost some too. Without a doubt the best sugar cookie ever.  If you don't try this recipe you are missing out.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

This review is coming from someone who thinks cooking involves pushing a button on the microwave.  I made these cookies (actually using the stove) this afternoon and they were fabulous!  Chewy and delectable -- I would recommend them to anyone, regardless of skill level!

Fantastic! We didn't have any crisco or unsalted butter, so I used salted butter.  Because of this, I omitted some salt but, the cookies were still a little salty.  However, my family and still absolutely love them!  They retain their softness (Awesome!) and taste great! Easy to make as well :) I've finally found a recipe I'll come back to!

I've been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe that's soft like my sisters who uses a 16oz bag of powdered sugar. This one hit the spot! Before I rolled them out I chilled them for a few hours to make them easier to roll and shape. I didn't put them in a ball and smush them like they say. They held their form very easily and were very easy to work with on a heavily floured surface, they didn't fall apart when I put them on the pan. I rolled them out to half of a centimeter or a little less.  They baked for 9 minutes, once you can see the tan on the edges, they're already overcooked. I used "Sugar Cookie Icing" by JBS Box. They came out like store bought sugar cookies, except better! Delectable!

Good recipe. Very light tasting, I did not roll them in sugar instead opting to put icing on them. I use a cookie scoop and roll them into balls, but I needed to flatten them out because they don't really do so on their own, just letting you know.

These didn't turn out well for me. I did as I read a couple other people did, which was using all butter rather than half shortening. Maybe that made a larger difference than I thought it would, because these turned out really like a flour-butter mixture. The first couple of cookies I forgot to flatten out, and they turned out slightly doughy in the center, which would have been ok but the flavor seemed sort of off. The rest I flattened, but didn't do much for the texture. My husband loves sugar cookies but didn't like these. Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

This is a wonderful basic recipe -- you can be creative and add your own touches.  The cookies come out dense, kindav a cross between a sugar cookie and a shortbread cookie.  I added 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, as some other reviewers suggested.  I made these for a Halloween party and decorated them with colored sugar, frosting, and icing.  It was amazing how quickly they disappeared!  I didn't even get a chance to try one.  I had people coming up to me all night telling me they loved the cookies.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Growing up, my aunt always made sugar cookies for every occasion, and I always hated them. (others raved over her recipe, but i found them really bland and flour-y). This recipe is GREAT! now that I've found this, I don't think I will ever use another. I used the  Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe from here on top, and everyone LOVES 'em.

WINNER!!!!!!!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I love chewy sugar cookies and have had the hardest time finding a sugar cookie that's soft and chewy... well this is it.  I paired it with a frosting recipe from allrecipes.com, and sprinkled them with sprinkles.... I have to send them to the police station with my husband, or else I'll be in BIG trouble.  They are SO SO SO good!  A++++++

These are the absolute BEST sugar cookies I have ever made! Instead of just rolling them into balls I floured my counter top and rolled the dough out on that so that I could use cookie cutters, and they worked out GREAT! They were soft, but not crumbly, and they tasted great! I also frosted them with Decorator Frosting (Which I would also recommend). I will never use a different sugar cookie recipe again, even my brother who does not like sugar cookies was BEGGING for more!

I am used to sugar cookies being flat. I was about to rate this recipe "4" stars.  However, my kids absolutely loved them!  I loved them, too.  They were soft, rich, and chewy.  I substituted 1 of the teaspoons for vanilla for 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring.  I also flattened my cookies.  This is a DELICIOUS recipe!

I have made these four or five times and people absolutely love them.  I leave the sugar off the top and then ice them with a butter cream frosting. This is not a sugar cookie I would serve plain-it needs some kind of frosting on it.  I scoop them out with a cookie scoop, flatten them with a milk glass dipped in flour and then bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  This simple cookie was by far the most popular item at our Thanksgiving dinner this year.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  I omitted the shortening and used only butter. I rolled every few balls in colored sugar - big hit with the kids.  Very light and buttery.  Will definately make again.

This was a great cookie! I made them for Christmas, and my husband loved them so much he asked me to make them again because the first batch was gone before the New Year! Also, I found this to be quick and easy to make as well. What more could you ask for, but a cookie that taste great and is easy to make. No wonder this won a blue ribbon! Thanks Laura!

The crispier this cookie is, the sweeter the taste.  Otherwise it just tastes like too much butter.

love love love this recipe! they come out soft and chewy, though i found that when you first take them out of the oven the middles appear soft. my mom thought they were too doughy so she had me make batch and flatten the balls out a little before baking. they didn't seem as doughy when first taking them out but after they cooled i found that the ones that i had pushed down turned crispy. The ones that i has just rolled as the recipe stated stayed nice and fluffy and my mom agreed that after fully cooling they didn't seem doughy. So my advice is to just do as the recipe says, roll them up and bake and you will have the worlds perfect sugar cookie! :)

I made these last night and had to wait until now to review since I've tried some recipes that almost broke my teeth next morning, they were so hard....but not these!  They held their tasty softness. :-)  Of course, I made some minor adjustments to give extra softness and light buttery flavor, so for us, they're perfect! 
I added 3/4 cups more sugar; added an extra tsp vanilla; instead of straight shortening, only used 1/3 cup plus 2 sticks real butter (1cup), and 1/3 cup Country Crock tub spread.  You'll want to make sure you blend wet ingredients well BEFORE you add the eggs, then handle as little as possible afterward, for added softness.  After one bite, my husband fell in love all over again! ;-)  Enjoy!

A great recipe! Super simple and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and watched the video 10 times to be sure I was doing it right.  I only needed 11 minutes exactly to get them perfectly cooked in my oven.  I hand rolled them and pressed them into colored sugar flattening them just a little with my fingers before placing them on the cookie sheet, and they came just right.

I made another batch where I added two teaspoons of raspberry extract along with the vanilla extract and it just gave these cookies an extra oomph, I loved it even better than the orginal recipe.  My boss who is a Master baker tried them, and she loved the raspberry infused ones.  Next time I will add some real raspberry preserves to the middle.  I cannot wait to experiment with different extracts like peppermint, orange, and almond.  The skies the limit with these cookies as far as extracts and toppings.  Have fun.

I used this recipe for Christmas sugar cookies and everyone seemed to love them. I'm not much of a cookie fan, honestly, but these had a delicious butter taste on the tongue. I used this as a cookie cutter recipe and I should have rolled thicker. Next time, drop cookies! :)  Thank you!

These cookies were awesome!  So easy to make and had such great flavor!
I DO recommend pressing each ball of cookie dough down lightly before baking, as the cookies do not spread out very much.  I used the bottom of a glass for this.  Just don't flatten the dough too thin or you'll have thin and crispy "sugar crackers" instead of cookies, haha.

I love this recipe! Sugar cookies have never been my favourite cookie because they tend to be a bit crisper than I like, but these ones are so soft and tender. I used almond extract instead of vanilla because I'm a sucker for almond, and they were fantastic. My two-year-old daughter and I rolled out a portion of the dough so we could cut out hearts and then rolled the rest into little balls and dipped them in sugar; both turned out great. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! I'm throwing out my other one and replacing it with this one.

Delicious!  These cookies are simply yummy!  Will definitely be my sugar cookie recipe from now on.  The cookies are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.  Thanks for the recipe!! To the people who said they were too salty crumbly and flat they didn't follow the recipe correctly.  You can't use margarine in these and expect the cookies to turn out.

This is my go to recipe.  I use
self rising flour, but only use 3 cups, 
and makes them soft and fluffy, and I also
omit the salt.  I use buttercream
frosting, with real butter. YUM

Great Recipe!! 
My kids and I made these cookies, we rolled them out to create Christmas Cut-Outs and the turned out Excellent!! I used powdered sugar instead of flour on my table and rolling pin. I also did not allow them to bake 10-12 minutes because I did not want them crispy. We let them bake 7-8 min. Greatest Sugar Cookie Ever!! My children love the "Lofthouse" cookies, and I agree they are very much like those favorites. Awesome!!!

These cookies are perfectly chewy and soft! I love how easy they are! They are not very sweet to me, so I will add some icing once they cool down. I made some changes because of what I had on hand - I only had shortening, no butter, so I used all shortening and decreased the flour by 1/2 c. I can't wait to try this recipe as written.

This was a perfect recipe for sugar cookies, they were so soft and delicious. If you roll the dough into balls just make sure to flatten it out a little bit if you want your cookies to come out bigger. it was also a great dough for cookie cutters.

absolutely delicious and decadent. I used 1 Tbs per cookie, then smooshed it onto the pan with the bottom of a glass. I didn't use sugar to coat them because I'm going to put frosting on them, but the cookies themselves are even better then store-bought, something I thought I'd never be able to find in a sugar cookie recipe. Well done!!!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe ever! Like the other reviewer, I substituted the shortening with margarine and it was perfect! If you was to frost & decorate, I recommend flattening the cookie balls just a bit.

These were SUPER soft sugar cookies! I absaloutley loved that they stayed so soft and got many compliments on that. The flavour wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, they lacked a little bit but over-all they were amazing! I will definately use this recipe again. They were very easy to make, making sure you cream together the butter, shortening and sugar well . Thanks for a great recipe! :)

These cookies were great.  I rolled some in sugar, some in cinnamon and sugar mixture (my favorite), and iced some with sugar free icing and put different sprinkles on top.  They were a hit!  Will be making more near the holidays for gifts.

I made snickerdoodles about 8 years ago and lost the recipe. I had been trying recipe after recipe with no luck, then I found this sugar cookie recipe. I just roll them in cinnamon-sugar and they taste just like the soft, fluffy snickerdoodles I love. They also make perfect soft sugar cookies, my husband loves them! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I didn't care for these at all.  I give them 2 stars for being soft as stated, but they tasted like the cheap Walmart sugar cookies that sell for 2 bucks for a dozen.  11 minutes was the perfect cooking time and came out looking delicious, unfortunately they weren't.

I usually prefer a more complicated cookie, but I was helping a friend make sugar cookies for her new man's birthday. We didn't roll them in sugar, but made a small batch of cookies and a cookie cake (which came out fantastic). They reminded me of shortbread, and the texture was gorgeous! I think they'd be fun to experiment with too. Thanks!

Made these for the 2nd time today and this time I used white whole wheat flour from King Aurthur.  AMAZING!!!  Didn't change the light and fluffy cookie at all.  I baked for 10 minutes and the bottoms were perfect and golden and the whole wheat flour actually made them taste "richer" than the last time I made them with plain white flour.

Only sugar cookie I will ever make!!!  Opps, forgot I also added a dash of lemon extract along with the vanilla - brightens it up.  Frosted with the frosting recipe found on this site called "Butter Icing for Cookies" - yummy too.

these were yummy...I thought I'd be creative & exchange a 1/2 cup white for 1/2 whole wheat...it lost some of the fluff but still nice...not nearly as pretty as the picture though!!

It was Really good, and certainly a lot better than the rolled out cookies, all hard and just not satisfying. However this seemed to lack something for me. Perhaps I should have out in more vanilla, but it tasted a lot like flour to me, not like a sugar cookie. But I will be making them again this week for a neighbor and hopefully they come out a bit better. Overall a very good recipe just needs a little more something, my husband said they were "The Bomb", and he's a tough critic.

I've made this as is, but prefer it with all butter. I also like icing on top as opposed to the additional sugar (look up the sugar cookie icing recipe on this site--and consider adding lemon or cinnamon to make them special). Since these are soft, they are like mall cookies when you put icing on them and this adds to the flavor since these are not very sweet. As is, though, they are quite good and go well with coffee or tea. I had one for breakfast this morning--not healthy but yummy.

These are so simple to make and taste soooo good. The key to keep them from spreading is the shortening. I made these over and over with all butter becasue I didn't want to use shortening. And no matter how long they were in the fridge or freezer they would always spread. I gave in and tried it with the shortening and to my surprise, they held their shape. I added a little extra vanilla becasue I like the flavor and did not refridgerate it before baking. Rolled the dough into balls, rolled them in sugars, then used a cup to slightly flatten them. Baked perfect at 11 mins.

I am baking these as I write this...I am in love with anything almond so I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract when I added the vanilla extract..After I rolled the dough into balls, I dipped the tops of the ball into a bowl of purple and pink jimmies, then placed them onto the cookie sheet. They look so pretty for easter  and they taste fabulous!!!! I will use this recipe whenever I need a sugar cookie.

the recipe was easy to follow, however when the cookies baked their 10-12 minutes, the bottom was burnt and the rest of the cookie was only semi-baked. apparently, when making sugar cookies, the dough should not be rolled into balls, but flattened. we burnt 24 cookies and only remained with 9 that are baking in the oven now LOL.
hope you all have better luck than we did.

Really liked the ease of making these sugar cookies. Using a standard size cookie dough scoop, this made about 4.5 dozen cookies. Made some rolled in sugar, some plain and frosted. Good either way. Quick to make and easy and good flavor too. Made exactly as written.

On a recent snow day and schools were closed. My 10 year old daughter wanted to make sugar cookies. We found this recipe and made it-we loved these. We only had and used regular sugar on hand-to roll it in. Very easy to make and i will make again.
Made it again for beginning of school year treat and grabbed lemon extract instead of vanilla-very yummy and a late summer twist

I am not a big fan of sugar cookies but this was the best tasting ever; it was not too sweet and came out just right.  I added peppermint flavoring to change it up a bit and my 3 year old loved it.  I skipped rolling it in the sugar to cut down on the sugar content.  Thanks for posting.

Everyone has different taste buds, that being said, I personally didn't like the cookies too much.,neither did my husband or kids. I read the reviews thinking this was going to be "a keeper", but i followed the recipe exactly and yes they were simple, yes they stayed nice and fluffy but sugar cookies are my favorite and this one was missing something. I gave it a 2 1/2 for simplicity of recipe and for the thickness ( i love thick cookies vs. flat ones ) again, i personally will not make these again.

I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe that made soft cookies that my husband would put his stamp of approval on. This recipe was it!! I modified it a little. I only used margarine. No butter or shortening. I also rolled them out instead of doing the balls rolled in sugar. I had to knead in a little more flour but they turned out fine. I baked them for 10-11 minutes. I also frosted them. They were a hit and I will be making them again.

This recipe is awsome for cookie cutters also; In my oven; only 7mins to cook. I've made it 2x in the last 2months for the holidays. I've never made homemade sugar cookies with cut outs. Always thought it was a lot of work, but this recipe is easy. The dough does at first look too dry to roll out but work it into a ball and your hands warm up the dough and it rolls nice. I have a wooden rolling pin and the dough did just fine with adding flour to my rolling pin. Do not make dough too thin. I'm no pro when it comes to dough. I totally recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to give it a try. Have the kids help cut out the cookies. The recipe gives me about 4 dozen, so it can take up some time if your new to cookie cutting dough. Have fun.

I used butter only, as I had no shortening on-hand, and these are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever had. Several people have requested the recipe! 10 min was perfect in my oven. Thank you!!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I like sugar cookies when first out of the oven because they are soft but then they get hard after awhile. These cookies did not get hard they are wonderful!!! I also used them as roll out cookies.

Everyone loved these. I made christmas cookies using cookie cutters of xmas trees, stockings, and snowflakes. Then I decorated them with hardening frosting. They were adorable! The cookies themselves aren't super sweet, so the frosting was a nice added sweetness! Super good!

I have made of 200+ different sugar cookie recipes over there years in search of something resembling my Grandma's recipes that no one can replicate, this is almost it! A big hit and got the seal of approval from my Grandpa! Very easy to make and with a little homemade frosting PERFECTION! I can't tell you what it means to have this recipe in my family.

This is a tasty cookie!  I made them for Halloween and sprinkled orange sugar on them.  This is definitely not a recipe for rolling out and using cookie cutters (too moist), so I just made round cookies.

So delicious! I added slightly less butter though, and used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose baking flour. It made them taste so yummy! Perfect texture!

These cookies came out perfect, I followed the recipe to a T. I softened my butter in the microwave and was worried I got it too soft, but they still came out perfect! The butter flavor was wonderful, the texture of these cookies is the best I have ever had from a home made sugar cookie. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

Most of the time when I bake cookies, they fall flat and too crispy. These, however, are perfect! 5 stars!

I actually made half a batch of these cookies with my older boy today and you know, they turned out so great that I wish I'd made the whole batch so that I could give them away and show them off! I used whole wheat white flour and an organic egg. These were great just rolled in sugar but I bet they'd be good as a Snickerdoodle, too! Super easy cookie with a great flavor. They just melt in your mouth! NOTE FOR ME: 20 cookies out of a half batch.

SOOOO YUMMY!  I used oil instead of shortening and they turned out GREAT!  On the last few batches I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  I recommend this if you like cinnamon!  YUM YUM!

i really liked this. It was light and yummy. I frosted them and put sprinkles on them. Very good. I did them in 3 batches and the best were the ones that i flattened out slightly with a cup. They took 10 minutes to bake to perfection. Than you!

I'd never made sugar cookies like this before- Only the kind you roll out and cut into shapes. However, my boyfriend wanted some regular old sugar cookies, so I found this recipe. This was a very simple recipe to follow and the dough was super-easy to work with.   I'm not a huge fan of sugar cookies, so I thought they tasted ok, but everyone else who tried them really liked them.   The only problem I had was that when I rolled them and put them directly on the baking sheet, they came out all round and puffy and looking like little turtle shells (which would be really cute if you tinted the dough green), so I started scrunching them after rolling them in the sugar. I kind of expected I'd need to scrunch them, but I wasn't sure if the dough would spread out much, and it really doesn't, which is nice.   I baked them for about 10 minutes and they came out perfectly, although they were a little crunchier than I expected. Although they were pretty crunchy on the outside, they were still soft in the middle.   I suspect this recipe might also be good for cut-out sugar cookies as well.   Very good recipe :)

I did everything everyone said: creamed the sugar and shortening, rolled them into balls, sprinkled on sugar, and these turned out awful. Very dry! The only ones edible were so undercooked, they almost ran. Sorry, I don't know what happened here, but I won't make these again.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I wanted to make Christmas cut out cookies that were soft.  I chilled them for an hour before rolling out and cutting.  They turned out perfectly soft and delicious.  Perfect for frosting.  I used a stone baking sheet and they didn't brown or turn crispy.  10 minutes was just enough time.

We liked this-it was simple to put together-I rolled it into balls, then flattened w/a spice jar, dipped in colored sugar. I added almond flavoring also.The last 1/2 dozen spread , but I didn't cool the pan as much as I did before, so my fault. I will definetely make again, maybe try some different extracts, too.

These were good.  I made half of the recipe and still came out with 20+ cookies that were a good size.  I had to bake mine about 14 min and still weren't brown on bottom.  I also would suggest spraying your pan with a non-stick spray.  I thought there was a bit too much salt, will reduce next time. These don't spread much, you can place them fairly close.

These are wonderfully soft & delicious!  I used only 1/2c shortening, 1/2c butter and 1/4 tsp salt.  I had to bake them a little longer but I made them rather large.  On top, I piped on Sugar Cookie Frosting from this site (which I LOVED -perfect for decorating)!  To keep the cookies soft, store in an airtight container with a slice of bread!!  UPDATE: I've made these several times & everybody loves them.  They're similar to the soft, fluffy ones at the grocery store.

The BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried.  I had almost given up on finding one that was still edible after 2 days.  However, I did omit a little bit of the dry ingredients, flattened out the dough balls, and lowered my oven temp a little bit.

THESE ARE MY NEW "ROLLED" SUGAR COOKIES!!! No more refrigerating for hours or back-breaking work rolling out dough for me! This is what i did: When i mixed up the  dough it was crumbly so i added apple sauce until the dough was moistened just enough(but not enough to be wet or sticky). Then all i had to do was pat out handfuls of the dough to my desired thickness directly onto a foil-lined baking sheet, cut out my shape, and peel the excess dough away! I made candy canes, stars, and christmas trees! They puffed up nicely but kept their shape! "Sugar Cookie Icing" gave them a glossy, professional finish perfect for my holiday cookie gift baskets!!

All I have to say is WOW!  This is exactly what I was looking for in a sugar cookie.  Another reviewer had said these reminded her of Lofthouse cookies.  She was right!  I had to do two substitutions due to a lack of ingredients on hand, but the result was so great I think I will use my modified version from now on.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  This definitely satisfied my sugar craving. =)

Substitutions:

1.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  This yielded a more tender-crumbed cookie. (1 CUP all-purpose flour = 1 CUP + 2 TBSPS cake flour)

2. I used all butter instead of butter and shortening as called for in the recipe.  

Tips:
1. Know your oven - mine runs a little on the hot side so I baked my cookies for only about 9 minutes, turned off the oven, and let them sit in there for about 2 minutes before pulling them out.

2. After mixing, I placed the bowl in the fridge for approximately 5 minutes to chill slightly.  I find working with cooler dough to be easier and less messy.

3. DO NOT OVER BAKE...unless you like crunchy cookies.  This can never be stressed enough.

I am really bad at making cookies.  I can cook, bake, can  and just about make  anything but my sweets are usually horrible. I made these and gave them to my in-laws,  scared at best.   My mother-in-law loves sugar cookies and ASKED me for this recipe. Thank you- thank-you- thank you.  If she liked them......  they are the best.  You made my day.  Will recommended them to everyone.  

Thank you

I have a gentleman friend that craves soft cookies! I wanted to treat him after a stressful day. I found these and the reviews raved...and they have never let me down! These are awesome! Soft, but not heavy in any way. I also used real butter with the butter flavored shortening. The sweet and buttery flavor was amazing. If food is the way to a mans heart...these cookies will keep him around a long time. The recipe I have used from my mother for the past 20 years hit the shredder. Sorry Mom :)

Follow-up guilty admission! I was having one of those days that nothing seems to go right. I wanted to splurge on my favorite "make me feel good treats", so I combined them! I made this recipe, (turned out great again)and let cool. In the mean time, I coarsely chopped Pecans and melted a bag of caramels. I dipped the tops of the cooled cookies into the caramel, pressed them into the chopped pecans, and when the caramel was cool, melted a bag of chocolate chips and once the melted chocolate started to cool, spread it all over the top of the cookies. Probably not the first one to think of it...but after a couple, all was well in the world of gayle again!

I have to say, I'm being generous with a three star rating. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, and was not impressed. Both myself and my boyfriend found the result to be a crumbly, almost too-floury cookie, that tasted like butter. And not in the good way, in the overwhelmingly greasy way. It was strange. Though the texture screamed "Too much flour!" the taste begged to differ, yelling "Too much butter." To put it simply, I don't think I'll try this recipe again. It seems like more work than it's worth, honestly. Sorry.

This cookie recipe is great!  I added 2 teaspoons of grated orange peel to the batter for extra flavor and they came out just delicious!  I also flattened the cookie balls a little before baking.  Will make these time and time again....THANKS!

YUM! This is absolutely perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used butter instead of shortening and halved the salt.  I added a little bit more sugar (almost a 1/4 cup) and baked them for about 12-13 minutes.  They came out perfectly soft and delicious, not crunchy at all.  Rolling them in sugar really makes a difference.  These are amazing!  I iced them with the "Decorator Frosting" from this website and that came out spectacular.

I despise hard sugar cookies, and these were the exact opposite of hard! I was shocked at how well these baked and how soft they are even after cooling.  Pair them with the Sour Cream Frosting recipe and you have yourself a bit of Cloud 9!

My whole family LOVES these cookies. My oldest daughter is a sugar cookie fiend! I always double the recipe and freeze half so she can make them whenever she wants. I did add a little extra sugar - I always add extra to recipes because, to me, when things bake, some of the sweetness is lost. I think this is a very good basic recipe that you can add things to according to your taste.

Fantastic sugar cookie! I make these for the July 4th and loved the fact that I didn't have to roll & cut them out. I topped them with some festive frosting and they were a hit!

These simple cookies are FANTASTIC!!!!  I've already made them twice this week b/c my family's eating them so fast. :)
I found that mixing the dry ingredients with the creamed mixture just until combined really made rolling the balls easier (less sticky).  These are positively delicious...when you eat one while they're still warm, they literally melt in your mouth.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

These were definitely not "the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted".  The texture was good--soft and chewy like it said, but they were really bland, kinda tasted like snickerdoodles without the cinnamon.  I had to roll then in sugar and ice them with buttercream frosting to get any kind of *sugar cookie* flavor.  Even my two little boys didn't care for them, and they'll usually eat any cookies. Definitely not a make again!

We loved these!  My husband loves sugar cookies and I do not enjoy the chilling/rolling part of making them... so this was the perfect recipe for us.  I added a little bit a lemon juice to give them a lemony flavor.  Since there are only 3 of us, I baked a dozen and kept the rest of the dough refrigerated in the bowl.  Throughout the week when we craved cookies, we just scooped some out and baked.  I made "Sugar Cookie Frosting" from this site to go on top and it was a great combination.

I made these for Christmas b/c i love soft sugar cookies....But these were far from soft.  I underbaked them on purpose b/c i like them "chewy" soft.  Well after cooling they were like ROCKS.  Husband said they had a good flavor b/c of the shortening but were so rock hard, it was difficult to eat them.  Try the best rolled sugar cookies on this site.....If you love SOFT thick sugar cookies!!!

I thought these came out terrible. It seemed like something was missing. Also the only sugar I tasted was the sugar on the outside. I've been up all day cooking and I'm kinda ticked the I wasted my precious time .

I had a cookie attack and made these at about midnight. They were so easy and really fast. My dough was very sticky, so rolling the balls in sugar was out of the question. Instead, I just sprinkled sugar on the top. These are really soft, even the next day. I have tried many boxed mixes for sugar cookies hoping for soft ones, but I have yet to find a box that comes close to these!

Good, easy recipe. The edges are getting a little crisp (about 30 min out of the oven) but the middles are still soft.  The edges get cracked when flattening with a glass, which I did in order to prevent coming out with ball-shaped cookies.  I used all butter instead of part shortening and part butter (to avoid trans-fats).  I also experimented with using a small cookie cutter on a little of the dough to see how these would hold their shape if I wanted to use this recipe for cut-outs; the dough was a little hard to handle when transferring the shaped dough to the sheet for baking (such soft dough) and the cut-outs did puff up a little bit. They'd be fine as simple shapes (hearts, etc.) but not for more ornate cookies (snowflakes, etc.).  Overall, these fulfilled my husband's craving for a soft sugar cookie.

These cookies are ridiculously good.  I just finished making a batch to drizzle with orange and black glaze to take to work for Halloween. They haven't even finished cooling yet and I decided to make an extra batch for home since the ones I just made won't last long.

I finally had great success with a cookie recipe!(so far have not mastered cookie making) This was easy and soft like the name describes. I used several variations. On some I put M & M's on top, some cinnamon and sugar and some a glaze of powdered sugar, lemon juice & milk. My teenagers loved them and so did I. Will definitely make again.

These are very delicious.  I love that you don't have to roll them out.  They are especially good with frosting.  The baking time needs to be closely monitored because I found that if they were even slightly overbaked, they weren't soft and chewy.  Also, they seemed to loose the softnes once they were frozen.  They taste their best when they are fresh.  All in all however, a great recipe for sugar cookies.

No wonder these won the blue ribbon at the state fair! Excellent! My daughter and I just whipped these up for a tea party. I only made half the recipe, but they were quick and easy. I love that you don't have to refrigerate the dough. We made them small per the directions with the sugar on top. They are sweet, super soft and delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing the recipe Laura!

This was the sugar cookie recipe I was looking for! It came together easy in my stand mixer and turned out perfect... soft and sweet! I used a cookie scoop to make handling the dough easier... it's very sticky. I think the key to this recipe (if you are looking for a soft cookie) is to not overbake them, and I used a little more vanilla than called for.

Thanks Laura! This one is a keeper.

Disappointed.  Followed the recipe exactly and found them salty and hard to put together.  11 minutes isn't enough time for the bulk of the cookie but any longer and the bottoms burn.  Very disappointing.

In the middle of the recipe, I realized I ran out of baking powder.  Sub'd for 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of cream of tartar.  Also sub'd shortening for margarine on hand, combined with butter.  These were AMAZING!  Im afraid to try the real recipe now ;) lol.  Happy Holidays!

Made these yesterday (with no changes except baked at 350 for 9 mins) and my husband and I agreed they were perfect!  The dough wouldn't roll out flat or cut very well, so I rolled them into balls and baked just like that. Not a lot of flavor, so before I baked I rolled in cinnamon and sugar and drizzled with a glazed icing. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful! Great texture and flavor. Don't skip the shortening, as I think it's the key to raising these cookies to amazing status. They are like Lofthouse cookies from the grocery store, but without unnecessary extra ingredients and strange chemical flavor. My husband doesn't like Lofthouse cookies but loves these. I like both, but definitely prefer these. This will be my go-to sugar cookie from now on.

These cookies turned out great! I will admit that when I tasted the dough, it wasn't very good due to the fact that it tasted like shortening. However, after I baked them, (I ended up baking them for 11 minutes) they turned out soft and fluffy on the inside with a great sweet and buttery flavor. This recipe was easy and fairly quick as the dough does not have to be chilled. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who is thinking about trying it! Two thumbs up!

Very simple and forgiving. I used only a tiny sprinkle of salt, and vegetable oil instead of shortening. While the dough was a bit soft, the cookies turned out beautifully, soft and chewy. I made a plain version as well as a cinnamon one. Both were great.

Followed the recipe exactly....which I rarely do. I used my melon ball scoop and made them all the same size. After I scooped them onto parchment paper, I rolled them into a ball and then dipped them in various sprinkles and sugars that I had "bits" of in my cabinet! Great way to clean out the sprinkles and my kids love them! I baked them on Parchment paper for 10 minutes using my Convection Oven. They came out perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful! Per other reviewers' comments, I decreased salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I did not roll mine in granulated sugar, and they were still sweet enough to enjoy on their own. Adding icing, though, brings these into heavenly territory! You may want to flatten the tops a bit before putting the balls of dough into the oven. I did this with all my pans after the first one, as I felt they came out a little too high when I didn't smush the balls down a little first. These taste like an even better version of the Lofthouse ones, without all the preservatives, etc.

Great cookie recipe!  I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and the cookies were delicious.  I also rolled it out and cut with cookie cutters (omitting the granulated sugar), which worked perfectly with this dough.

I loved the original sugar cookie version, but I experimented when I wanted a soft peanut butter cookie. Let me just say it works. Not sure if anyone else wrote about the substitute in the reviews, as I did not have time to go through all fifteen hundred of them. I just used the same amount of peanut butter instead of shortening. I rolled balls, made a small thumbprint and filled with various jellies, then cooked for the same amount of time.

Best sugar cookies ever:  they were soft like pillows and oh so addictive!  Can't make too many of these--I'd eat all of them up!  They even stayed soft after a couple of days!  I didn't put any sugar on top, but they didn't really need the extra sugar.  Wonderful recipe!

I wanted to bake Christmas cookies with my boys and needed a recipe that was good for rolling and cutting.  I also wanted cookies that were soft.  So, as someone who had never baked cookies before, this recipe was perfect!  I actually baked as written and also rolled some dough out for cutting, and both methods worked well.  If you want to roll out the dough, try wrapping the dough in some wax paper and putting in the fridge for about 30 min to an hour.  Then roll out between two pieces of wax paper.  Dip cookie cutters in cold water just prior to cutting.  Also, I added about 1/4 tsp of almond essence for extra flavor.  Yum Yum Yum!!!.

This is a very good sugar cookie! I baked them at 350, for 8 minutes and let them cool on the pan for about 5 minutes. They are soft when completely cooled, with the perfect amount of sweetness! The family enjoyed them very much! Thanks!

Makes a wonderful fluffy Lemon Sugar Cookie. I substituted three teaspoons of Lemon Extract for the 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I also added the fresh zest of two small lemons, and just a touch of the lemon's juice. This made a beautiful, fragrant and tender cookie that would be perfect with a cup of Earl Grey tea.

These cookies were perfect!  Soft and light.  I subbed splenda for a 1/2 cup of sugar.  I omitted vanilla extract and divided the dough into 4 parts and added a different flavor extract to each (almond, coconut, butter and cherry almond).  They were each uniquely fantastic!  I baked for 8 minutes for perfect softness and light brown bottoms.

These were a huge hit with my Hub and Mother-in-law ... because of the reviews I had read, I cut the salt in half. I also rolled 1/3 of my cookies in Cinamon Sugar, did 1/3 normal and the other 1/3 I added some walnuts to. They didn't even last 24hours! haha. I'll have to make them again, but I think I'll add some frosting and some Hersey's kisses too =)

I just made these. They are very good and very easy. My 2yr old son and I made them together. I rolled them into balls and then just flattened them a tiny bit before putting them into the oven. I saw a comment about how they were too salty. But, you really need to use 'Unsalted Butter' when baking to control the salt. They weren't salty at all, just plain good and moist.

Loved that these cookies cooked "up" and not "out." I rammed 24 cookies on one cookie sheet! This is my kind of recipe! 
Followed recipe, took 13 min to bake.

I very rarely eat sweets as I don't like very sweet things, but there is just something about the Lofthouse cookies that I can't resist. I have been known to eat 1/2 the package before reaching the registers! These are better. Holy Toledo, make these cookies! Per other reviews, substituted 1 tsp of the vanilla with almond, cookie scooped onto pan, pushed down about halfway with colored sugar dipped glass bottom. Baked 10 minutes, removed to rack after about a minute so they would not continue cooking or dry out on hot sheet pan. Perfect! I'm using pastel sugar and taking to a baby shower and then doing again for Easter because they're so pretty as well as yummy :)

These were excellent! I was expecting (hoping) them to turn out like the cookies one buys in the store, but although they did not resemble those they were tasty and very soft. A caution, though---I made this recipe expecting it to yield 25 cookies and ended up with 50. The result worked out well for me, but I just want to warn you! Especially because they're also a little addicting :)

Love these cookies!  Easy to make and very yummy.  I love a soft sugar cookie and these are perfect.  Keep in sealed container and will stay soft for days.  No need to refrigerate unless doing cutouts.  I colored sugar with food coloring and rolled the cookies in it.  They turned out great!

This is a quick and really yummy recipe... I did run out of vanilla extract and did not quite have enough for this recipe so i substituted a little bit of sugar free vanilla syrup (the kind used for snow cones) and these still came out delicious and also added a little extra flavor. Some of the reviews I read said these were a little plain in the flavor dept. I'm not sure if it was the syrup I used but these were sooo good...and full of flavor...I am going to get some more vanilla and stick to the recipe next time but we wanted some cookies tonight and I didn't feel like getting out just for vanilla....

I can easily see how this was a State Fair Blue Ribbon winner. These are the best sugar cookies I've made, or ever had. These cookies are super soft, and just the right amount of sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out fantastic.

I will make these again, but will alter either the baking powder or salt.  These do have a salty bite in the back of the mouth.  My kids had a blast putting the spinkles on them, though!

I've never liked sugar cookies, maybe because they were hard.  These are soft, like the texture of shortbead.  I only used butter, no shortening. Chilled the dough and rolled it between parchment so we could cut shapes.  Used the 'Sugar Cookie Icing' recipe with it.

FOLLOWED RECIPE EXACTLY AND THEY WERE AMAZING!  I did as others stated and refrigerated dough for about 30 mins to keep it from being sticky.  (Although I don't think it was that bad without refrigerating.)  I used a melon baller to measure out a heaping scoop of each cookie.  Made them into balls, placed on cookie sheet, and then pressed down slightly with bottom of glass to flatten a little.  I kept mine about 1/8 - 1/4 inch thick. So chewy! Excellent flavor!  I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THESE AGAIN!

i made them in gingerbread men form. i left them a bit longer causing them to be crispy, but some i left shorter right before turning brown, right around 9 min. they came out soft. VERY GOOD. i substituted white sugar for regular granulated sugar, and the decor, i put pink sprinkles. came out great!!!!!

These were the softest, most moist cookies I've ever baked! They were incredible! Very easy to make, and the batter makes alot of cookies! Only thing was, I was afraid to roll them out to cut them with cookie cutters. I didn't want to add too much flour and change the way they baked. But they were fine, just round with frosting on top!

i really like this sugar cookie recipe. I would suggest using just a little less salt. when tasting the dough ( you know we all do it)...I really tasted more salt then I like. After they were baked..I thought...they were just a little too salty but a really soft cookie. All I had to do to fix it is to reduce the salt! I would recommend just using 3/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of salt! Mind as well..it would be better for you.

Made these over the weekend.  Dough was quite sticky and definitely not "rollable".  Had to add quite a bit extra flour to get them to roll into balls, but didn't hurt them one bit.  
Subbed almond extract for the vanilla, didn't roll in sugar before baking & took them out of the oven just as they started looking like they were getting color on the bottom edges. Came out excellent.  Great flavor, great texture, definitely sweet enough for my tastes without any icing added & still soft today.  Thinking I may try a citrus version with some with lemon extract and grated orange & lime rind added.

OMG these were AMAZING!  I substituted butter for the shortening (I never have shortening) and I didn't roll the dough in the granulated sugar.  After the cookies had cooled, I topped with funfetti frosting.  I brought these into work and they were devoured within minutes.  Bake for 8 minutes for a PERFECT soft cookie.

This is the best soft sugar cookie recipe that I've found!! And I've tried just about all of them w/ some degree of disappointment. The only change that I made was adding 1 tsp of almond extract and reducing the vanilla to 1-1/2 tsp.  My family loved them also and they were gone by the end of the day.

These cookies were almost excellent. They were good coming right out of the oven. But if you put them in a plastic bag they get a weird flavor added to the buttery taste of the cookies and are not the best I suggest you wrap them in aluminum foil. This is the only reason the cookies were rated 4 but if I could rate them again it would be 4.5.

These are awesome! They are fine as drop cookies but work well as roll out too, which is how I prefer sugar cookies :-) To add variety, substitute the vanilla for almond extract, very, very good!!!! Decorate as desired ( I like meringue icing and/or fondant).

My New Favorite Sugar Cookie Recipe! Everyone loves them cookies, kids & adults both. I just brought them to a cookout yesterday & everyone ate the whole plate. This recipe is Perfect as is. These cookies don't need any frosting, I used the sprinkles & they were delicious! They are super soft too! This recipe was just what I was looking for.  And if you want to try something a little different I used Tahitian Vanilla, its flavor is amazing.

Just made these for a church function, I was out of vanilla extract and had to use lemon extract. Yummy.
Very pleased.   Not overly sweet at all. If  you like a sweeter cookie only add about 1/4 cup sugar to the recipe. I thought the flavor was rather bland when I tasted the dough, so I added 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves to my dough, I am sure if I had vanilla extract it would have been perfect, think I will try coconut extract next time and add 1/2 coconut the batter with 1 tablespoon milk..

These cookies are just perfect!  No frosting necessary!  I didn't need 4 dozen cookies, so I halved the recipe.  I also added a few drops of red food coloring before adding the flour to make pink cookies.  I rolled them in sprinkles and colored sugar to make them pretty : )

I did not like these cookies at all. They were small, and not moist. They were also not soft. I added extra vanilla extract but it didn't help the taste. Too bland!

I made this recipe almost exactly like it says. All I did differently is that I added a teaspoon of lemon extract to give the flavor more dimension. I think it added a lot. The cookies taste great, but I was hoping for a thinner cookie. The way they turned out kind of looks like mini-biscuits. I even flattened them with the bottom of a glass before baking and still they were puffy, but still dense, not cake-like. I like the density, if only I could make them flatter!

Yummy!  I only changed one thing: instead of 2t vanilla, I used 1, plus 1/2t almond extract.  This was mostly to see if I could match the local bakery's cookie that sells for $1.50 each.  Mine were actually better!  I rolled them out thick, and did large cutouts and frosted with sugar cookie frosting from this site.  A definite keeper!

Hands down...easy recipe that DELIVERS what it says it will... cookies were delicious and soft!!  If you take them out right at 10 minutes then let them set on the hot pan for a couple to cool just a bit, they do bake a tiny bit more and they come out perfectly soft.  If you bake them the full time I thought they came out a little crunchier than we like!  Anyway we frosted them with the special buttercream frosting from this site instead of doing the sugar... and they were SO good!

Best. Cookies. Ever. 
I followed the recipe exactly. They came out wonderfully soft, with a bit of crunch on the outside from the sugar.

Absolutely perfect! I have a hard time making cookies just right, but this recipe is fool proof. I rolled the balls of dough in sugar before putting them on the cookie sheet which gave them a crispy outside and warm, chewy inside. I plan to make this recipe again and again! Thanks so much, Laura!

OMG, Sooooo good.  The sugar cookie has always been my favorite cookie, so I am naturally picky when it comes to these cookies.  I made these cookies, added a little extra ingrediants, and I must say...No other cookies can top these.  They were perfectly cooked with a small crunch on the outside, but so soft.  They stayed soft for days, then we finished them all.  I had a total of 22 cookies, but I could have gotten more out of it.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful cookie recipe.

I just made these cookies.  I am by no means a "baker" in fact I try not to. But these cookies turned out amazing!  I did not have any of the colored sugar. So I just rolled the dough in sugar and cardamom.  Next time I might just use cardamom.  Very good will make again and again.

My family loved these cookies the day I made them but within two days they were crunchy, even though I kept them in an airtight container. I won't make them again since we can't eat them all the day they are baked!

The kids made this with very little supervision- and it came out great! We ran out of time and had to chill the dough until the next day, but it rolled out and was easy to use cookie cutters with. We will use this many more times!

They're very good, and soft, like the title says. Just the one tip to all beginners: (Do NOT overmix) I used christmas cookie cutters with this recipe instead of rolling into rounds. They turned out just as good.  :)

I would give this 5 stars for the texture and 4 stars for the flavor.  They were definitely soft and dense, but the flavor of the shortening was just a bit too strong for my taste.  Maybe if I used butter flavored shortening instead or just less shortening overall, I could give them a full 5 stars.   I would recommend trying these!

This was another of the cookies I added to my Christmas goodie basket this weekend.  Well, I tried to however, my family ate all of them and I have to make more.  Great cookies.  Instead of rolling in sugar we dipped a glass in the sugar and gently pressed.   Thanks for sharing!

The best sugar cookie recipe I have ever found! Not a good dough for making shapes, but it makes beautiful circular cookies. I paired this with the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" from this website. My holiday party guests were super impressed! The cookies turn out soft and chewy and the icing makes them even better.

I loved how these cookies looked in the picture, but mine did not turn out that way....they came out flat...not sure why....and there was a taste I didn't care for, nor did DH...not sure if it is the shortening or not as I have never baked with it before. I was disappointed but considering the rave reviews, it must be me!

I was doing my Christmas baking so I needed a recipe I could use for cut out cookies. This one is the winner, so easy and tasty. I doubled the batch and I had them all cut out and baked in no time! Thank You for this recipe Laura, I WILL be making it again!

way to dry and crumbly. I think they would have been better with less flour, like a half a cup less at least. Boo made me sad cus as soon as I tried rolling them out to make shapes it would just crumble

The dough came out excellent.  I ran out of shortening so I had to use 1 cup butter and 1/3 cup shortening, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference.  I wanted to make a seasonal cookie, so I took 1/4 of the dough, mixed in about 1/3 cup pumpkin butter, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and about a cup of flour to bring the consistency back.  I then rolled out the plain dough into a long rectangle, spread the pumpkin dough on top, and rolled it into a cylinder.  I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap, put it the fridge for a few hours, and then sliced and baked.  It came out with a nice subtle flavor, perfectly done at 10 minutes.  I think next time I'll roll them in a cinnamon sugar mix to give a little extra spice.

DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly; super easy and the cookies turned out fantastic!  I ended up baking them for about 13 minutes and they're soft and chewy on the inside, with a little bit of easy crunch on the outside.  Perfect!  I rolled them in red/green sugar for Christmas!  I also wanted to see how the dough rolled out, and it was great!  I cut out a few shapes and those came out great too!  Great recipe; will be using this AGAIN!

These were good but not great. They really dont spread out at all, so after the first batch I made sure to press them down. I think the shortening makes them a little too firm. Next time I will try making with all butter. They weren't a soft inside as I had imagined, but everyone still ate them.

I made these for the first time yesterday for a halloween party. Everyone loved them and said how good they were. Someone said they were awesome. I also frosted them with homemade caramel-like frosting and put some sprinkles on top. I ate some before I left for the party and they were delicous but I was nervous that nobody would eat them. I made them last minute and put them on a plate when they were stilll warm so they all stuck together and broke apart. They didn't look very apetizing but everyone just picked at them and they all went fairly quickly once word got around that the broken cookies were delicious!

These were good with a few modifications.  I like my sugar cookies a little flatter so I pressed them with a glass before baking (they don't spread or flatten at all on their own). I also used a medium cookie scoop to speed the rolling/balling process and keep them uniform size.  I baked mine for 12 minutes and they great.  I tried baking longer but they got too crispy and lost their flavor.  I brought them to work and people said, "They taste just like the ones from the store!"  I guess that's a good thing?

These were delicious!  I never have shortening so I used butter instead and they were perfect!  I put them for 8 minutes and they came out just lightly golden brown on the bottom and soft on the inside.  Topped them with funfetti icing and they are perfection!

I just got done making these except I used a heart cutout and rainbow sprinkles. Everyone absolutely loves them! They are so delicious especially straight out of the oven. I wouldn't cook them over 10 minutes though or they get crunchy, 10 minutes is perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and they were delicious!  I did need more decorative sugar though than it called for, and I ended up with 52 cookies.  I loved the taste of butter, and the softness of the cookie with the crunch of the sugar.  My only complaint about these cookies was that I couldn't stop eating them, so I froze half of the batch to help me not eat them all!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever used!!!!! I'm so glad I chose it, I hate when the cookies don't taste right- that's a lot of butter to waste!! Let's see if my husband likes it as much as I do....hopefully there will be some left when he arrives...I just reached for another one!

Great cookies!  I prefer my sugar cookies to be more cakey than chewy, and that's how these are.  I topped them with homemade buttercream and they were super yummy--it was hard not to devour them all in one day.  :)

A most excellent sugar cookie!  They were soft and chewy, even a little fluffy!  I rolled them into golfball sized balls, but they keep their shape so well that I think I'll be using cookie cutters next time.   The only thing I would change about this recipe would be to add only 1/2 tsp salt instead of a full tsp.  They were just a little salty for my taste.  Also, this is a mildly flavored cookie, so a basic confectioners sugar/vanilla extract glaze, frosting, or other goodies (choc. chips, almond extract, etc.) make a perfect addition.  Yum!

These are awesome cookies! The only thing that I changed was that I used a tablespoon of a really strong vanilla. (Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla) My kids love them.

Great soft cookie recipe!  I change it a little by adding about 1 1/2 tablspoons of almond extract.  I also skip the sugar topping and whip up some frosting with powdered sugar, butter, water and more almond extract.

I would hit and miss on this recipe as far as softness until I decided to just put in 1 1/2 cups butter and skip the shortening.  It has come out perfect everytime after that!

These were perfect! The only thing i did different was use all butter. Do not flatten or roll these out, just put a ball on there and they come out great. moist, soft and just sweet enough! I will be using this recipe instead of regular old sugar cookies from now on! super yummy!

I was really skeptical when I started mixing these up because the batter wasn't as sweet as normal sugar cookie. When they were done (10 min was perfect), boy was I pleasantly suprised!  I did only add 1/2 tsp salt because 1 tsp seemed too much and I used a T cookie scoop instead of rolling them.  They were pretty small and would make them bigger the next time and just pat them down a little to make a wider cookie.  I frosted with the sugar cookie frosting recipe on the site and they were great!  These have a excellent texture and when they're done, they'll be gone quick!

This recipe is definitely wonderful! I didn't have shortening so I substituted it with half butter and half margarine. Since I ran out of time, I ended up preparing the dough the day before I could bake it, and then I frosted the cookies the day after that - but they're still amazingly soft and delicious. I can't get enough of them!

The kids said too salty, dry and when rolled in balls the dough stayed in balls while baking. I'll look for another recipe.

I really don't like to roll out cookies but I love sugar cookies so I tried these. They were AWESOME!! My family and friends agree. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These sugar cookies turned out great! I loved how soft and chewy they were.  I can see how some people would think they are a tad salty.  It didn't bother me though. I skipped rolling them in sugar, and used whipped frosting and colored sugar for the top! We will definitely make them again next year.

These cookies are delicious.I followed the recipe except I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough. I gave this four stars because I couldn't figure out the best way to cook them. I made walnut sized balls that didn't really spread so they looked like "biscuits". I made little balls slightly flattened. Then I made larger "flattened" cookies. Again, they are delicious, almost like a shortbread - butttery and not too sweet. I will frost with a cream cheese frosting.

They were good but reminded me more of a butter cookie...like a short bread.  It probably didn't help that I added almond extract for half of the vanilla.  And I would recommend smooshing them because balled up they just come out tiny and plump.  Not what I was looking for but good.

I made these cookies with soy butter(and no shortening) for my son who has a dairy allergy and they came out wonderful!  The dough was a little difficult to roll out, but the cookies came out nice and soft and actually taste better than the sugar cookies I made last year with real butter.  I frosted them with confectioner's sugar mixed with rice milk (it sounds kind of gross) and they are so good!  This is my sugar cookie recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!!

These turned out really well. I looked at the pictures, and there were some that were cut-outs, so I tried it.  It didn't make the best cuts, and the dough was pretty fragile- but overall flavor and texture were perfect! The original recipe and technique remind me of what we call "Cookie Monster Cookies," a recipe my family learned when I was in preschool 25 years ago!

I signed up for an All Recipes membership just so that I could tell all of you that you MUST make these sugar cookies!  They are easy because you don't have to refrigerate the dough or roll it out. What makes them the best cookie is the texture. Soft and chewy and they stay that way as long as you keep them covered. There are only a couple small things I tweaked just to add more flavor. 1.  I used Butter flavored shortening for more butter flavor 2.  I put the zest of one lemon in with the wet ingredients 3.  Instead of rolling in sugar, I put a cream cheese frosting on them when cooled completely.

Absolutely THE BEST soft sugar cookie I've ever eaten. I put a buttercream frosting on them and they are wonderful with a cup of coffee. This is one I'll definitely make over and over.

I LOVE these cookies!  My daughter has milk and egg allergies, and to make these for her, I use a butter substitute that does not contain milk, and I omit the eggs and use an individual cup of plain applesauce instead.  They turn out so soft and delicious every time!  These are my entire families favorites!

I'm only giving this four stars because I followed the recipe (except for doubling it for my large family), and they didn't flatten much.  Next time I'll try flattening the dough a bit before baking.  Otherwise they are soft and delicious.

For years I have been searching for that perfectly soft, melt in your mouth sugar cookie, not the rolled out kind. Finally found it with this recipe! I followed it EXACTLY and they turned out amazingly! Made around 30 or so last night and between me and my boyfriend there's only a couple left. These are amazing!

These are the BEST sugar cookies ever! Well... at least from the ones I have had. I made them to bring to camp with me, and I wanted to save them for night, but there was like 5 left then, I brought about 30 with me too. Although some of them crumbled me and my one friend ate all of the crumbs! Yum those were good. Also, the inside is nice and soft, and the outisde is hard which is good. I rolled mine in coloured sugar in creative colours and the red didn't taste good. These were GOOD!

Perfect cookie. Soft with a buttery and sweet flavor. I made these for treats for my daughter's softball game with some butter cream icing. They were a hit. I measured out 1/4 C. cookies dough and baked about 25-30 minutes per batch. This has become my new default sugar cookie recipe.

Overall, these cookies were amazing!  I'm not usually a cookie fan, but I and everyone else loved them!  My only "complaint" about these cookies was that the recipe made 32 cookies instead of 24 (well, 33 but don't tell anyone).  They would probably be good with ~3/4 cup of chopped pecans mixed into the batter.

This is a great recipe! It comes our perfect every single time, so I choose it when I need a quick desert that offers me no surprises. The only change I made was to use 10 oz. of butter instead of the butter/shortening mix. I personally don't touch shortening and never use it in anything that goes inside our bodies. What I also love about this recipe is its versatility as far as decoration options. Awesome recipe! Thank you for submitting it!

I have finally found a sugar cookie recipe that when I store them, they don't turn hard!  My family said that this is the best sugar cookie recipe that I have made, and trust me, I have made plenty of sugar cookies!

I love the way this sugar cookie turned out for me. I think these are definitely my new favourite. The reason I decided to try this recipe was because it had no milk listed in the ingredients. I didn't roll my dough in sugar before baking, but instead frosted it with Butter Icing for Cookies (recipe also from this site) It was the prefect combination as the cookie itself is not too sweet. I stored my cookies in an airtight container in the fridge and they had a lovely soft yet chewy texture to them. Also cause I only wanted a few cookies I had cut down the recipe and still took a container and put some dough into it and stuck it in the freezer. The dough only remained in the freezer for the couple of days cause these cookies were so wonderful I just had to have more. I took my container with the dough out of the fridge to thaw and it thawed out quickly mind you. I just scooped the dough from the container and made it into balls and lightly pressed them down a little. My cookies still turned out perfectly round and still had the same texture as when I made the dough fresh. Wonderful sugar cookie recipe, when you don't have milk on hand!

The recipe was great!  Nice and soft cookies, maintain their shape.  The ONLY thing I would do different is take the salt down to about 1/2 tsp.  Mine tasted kind of salty with the full amount listed.  Otherwise, awesome cookie!

Amazing!  Everybody loves them and they always remain soft even a couple days after baking. Although they never last that long.

This was the worst sugar cookie recipe I've ever made! It was dry and turned out awful..I even double checked to make sure the ingredients and the amounts I put in were correct (yes they were). I will never make this recipe again, and am afraid to try the rest on this site!

These cookies turned out great! wonderfully chewy and nice and sweet. I doubled up the butter instead of using shortening and used 1/2tsp baking soda + 2/3cup molasses because i didn't have any baking powder. I also added about 1/4cup extra flour to make up for the extra liquid of the molasses in the recipe. These turned out fabulous, just rolled lightly in sugar these cookies were a wonderful treat, my family gobbled them up.

Yummy! I altered the recipe slightly since I'm in high altitude...Increased flour by 3 1/2 Tbl., decreased sugar to 1 1/3 C., decreased baking powder by 1/4 tsp. I also used butter flavored shortening instead of shortening and butter. Dipped bottom of a drinking glass in water and then sugar and pressed the balls, no need to dip into water after first time, the oils from the dough will make the sugar stick with each dip. Baked for 10 mintues and let sit for about a minute and a half on the sheet out of the oven. Perfect!

Not very chewy, they stayed thick and didn't really spread.  I have a real sweet tooth- and this just didn't cut it for me.  Definitely needs a frosting...  Probably won't make again.

I've never made sugar cookies before... and this one was the best ever.. I made these for my daughter (I generally don't like sugar cookies)-- but I'm busy eating them away! I actually took the recipe and cut it in half-- so if you don't want to make 8 million cookies... change the servings to 12 and it turns out delicious!

I made these for my kids for a Valentine's Day after-school snack, and they are wonderful! I used all butter vs. shortening (I'm not a fan of that "shortening" taste) and didn't bother with rolling them in sugar, but I did flatten them slightly before baking. I found the dough very easy to work with, and only baked mine for about 9 minutes, then removed from the oven and let them sit on the hot cookie sheet for about 3 to finish doing their thing. This made for a perfectly soft/chewy center with a slightly crisp outside.  Once cooled, we frosted them with a basic buttercream icing (just find a good basic butter/powdered sugar/milk/vanilla recipe..takes 3 seconds to whip up!), and they were gone in no time! For those of you who found these to be bland, sugar cookies, in our experience, aren't necessarily supposed to be bursting with flavor by themselves...it's what you put on top of them that really brings out the yummy, buttery flavor of cookie! Thanks so much for this recipe - we've been looking for a SOFT sugar cookie recipe that doesn't have to be rolled out for a while now, and this one is just perfection!

This is my 3rd year trying to find a perfect sugar cookie at Christmas time and this one is IT! I followed the recipe except I chilled the dough 2 hours, made the balls good size and flattened down a little  with a glass dipped in flour. Baked 9 minutes and frosted. They were fluffy soft tasty and perfect! Everyone loved them :-))

Great cookie! I changed just a few things. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and only 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I used another recipe for the icing called "Sugar Cookie Frosting" by Kathy Brandt. I'll be making these again.

I upped the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the vanilla to 3 teaspoons.as suggested by another member.I am getting ready to frost these, if they make it to frosting! I am taking these to my Dad,who prefers a soft cookie, and I can not wait for him to try them. I also, would be in BIG trouble if I make these to often. Thanks again.

Ok, I know these are supposed to be soft but I prefer a crispier cookie.  So instead of 2/3c butter and 2/3c shortening I used 1/3c + 1/2c shortening and 1/2c butter.  I kept everything else the same and I have to say, these are some tasty cookies!  Perfect for my cookie press and everyone was so impressed with the results!  Thanks Laura!!!  ***UPDATE***  I decided to follow the recipe exactly for soft cookies.  I may like them crunchy but I really am all alone on that one and have had many requests for soft sugar cookies.  I came back to this recipe and it really delivered again.  Used my cookie scoop, rolled in sugar and flattened slightly with the bottom of glass.  The pic is of the soft version. Delicious.

For a tasty change with this recipe, I add mini chocolate chips, chopped marachino cherries (liquid drained), and coconut!  Bake as normal!  Makes a simple recipe a real christmas treat.  I do not frost these or put colored sugar on top when I add the extras!

Oh yeah - these are wonderful!  We made these tonight to roll out and decorate, they came out great.  I was concerned that as roll outs the 10 minute cooking time would be too long however found out it was perfect.  The key to soft sugar cookies is definitely to not over bake them.  Great advice to fluff the flour while measuring, because my son was helping the 3 1/2 cups was slightly too much, I used another user's advice to press the dough together with wet hands and no problems.  Let the dough sit in the fridge for 2 hours and the dough worked well.  We loved them.

Really delicious and very buttery, almost like shortbread.  The only thing I would do differently next time is smush them down a bit since they don't spread much.

Wow!  I didn't believe the reviews could possibly be true, but this is one amazing cookie!  I didn't bother to roll them into balls and coat them with sugar.  I just dropped them with my cookie dough scooper, then used buttercream icing on them.  Amazing!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with the world.

These cookies are awesome!  I did bake for 15 minutes, and flattened them out a bit.  I rolled half in sugar and the other half in a cinnimon sugar mix.

thanks for the cookie!

They weren't as good as I thought they would be. They were "doughy" tasting, yet cooked all the way through. They were balls rather than flat like a sugar cookie. Not sweet enough. The kids didn't like them, that says it all.I wouldn't make these again.

Update:
I made this recipe again last night, also cutting it in half. It was much better this time. The changes I made were simple but great. I added a half tsp of nutmeg and doubled the vanilla. When you so not roll them in sugar but just press the balls to flatten and bake it makes a good Lofthouse-type soft/cake-y cookie.

I halved the recipe. It wasn't the BEST cookie I've ever had, but I rated it 5 stars since it held up to last minute changes. I didn't know I was out of vanilla so I substituted almond. My boyfriend liked the flavor, but since I wanted a traditional sugar cookie I wasn't impressed. I ended up being a quarter cup short of granulated sugar so I subbed brown sugar. I was pleased the cookie stood up to the occasion. I decided to make some of the cookies "special" by placing M&Ms on top of the balls. They formed PERFECTLY shaped cookies. I also cut the mini fun sized snicker bars into quarters (NOT the larger fun sized ones) and pushed them into the uncooked cookie balls and then pressed the sides up to reform the ball. They came out EXCELLENT! I also rolled some of the balls in dried coconut powder (really more like minced coconut rather than a fine powder) Those were ALSO delicious. They came out so gorgeous. I'm definitely doing that again. My guests loved them and loved testing the special ones. This is a good standard sugar cookie that I look forward to experimenting with in the future. Recommend adding candies and such for a little bit of fun.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I used 3 tsp of vanilla & an extra 1/4 cup of sugar & they tasted great!  We rolled them into balls & in sugar and also rolled some out & used cookies cutters & both worked out fine. Balls in sugar were soft & chewy and the others were pretty crispy. Wonderful recipe, easy to make w/ kids, very tasty!

These were awesome!  Just the right taste, and they absolutely stay chewy.  I see what the previous reviewer said about flattening them if you want to frost them, because they don't flatten out much during cooking.  I rolled them and slightly flattened them in my hand before putting on the sheet.  Still way better than refrigerating and rolling them out.  Thanks!!

These were really good.  Before I baked the cookies, I used the back of a spatula to push down the cookies.  This made the cookies look better and prepared them to be iced if you opt to do that.  I used the Butterream Icing recipe that I had left over from another recipe, and the cookies were very delicious.  Very easy to make and very tasty, I will definitely use this recipe again.

These cookies are not just good...they are SPECTACULAR.  I love my sugar cookie cut-outs, but these are faster, easier, and softer.  I can mass-produce these with my 4 kids much better than rolling and cutting!  They are light and chewy, and look just beautiful with a dab of frosting and festive sprinkles!  Thanks so much!

Love it! It was easy to make and had great flavor. I did make some changes according to other reviews. I changed the 1/2 cup of regular sugar for confectionary sugar, i added half a teaspoon of vanilla, i did not use shortening I used butter instead, i only put half the salt because my butter was already salted. But it was so delicious!!

This was an awesome sugar cookie recipe! I wanted something simple, and I didnt want to have to get out my blender. I know one of the reviews said to let it chill, i just took it right from the bowl and pinched off what i needed. i didnt use a glass for the round shape, i just rolled the balls, and then when i put them on the cookie sheet, i took 3 fingers and flattened them out a little bit! another thing i added was, when i took them out of the oven, i added hersheys kisses on top! very nice touch! VERY GOOD!!!

Mine looked just like the picture and they stayed soft for days- I froze a bunch too, and when I defrosted them, they were just as fresh and soft and delish as when I made them initially.  really a good sugar cookie.

These were great!! Just what I needed, I almost ate them all in one night! The only thing I added was a little cinnamon on top after they were done baking. Overall, they were excellent! Very soft and so yummy! I will definitely be making them again.

Yummy! I am 36 weeks pregnant and was craving soft sugar cookies. This recipe fit the bill. They did seem a tad salty to me, but overall very good. I will keep this recipe!
I used the bottom of a glass to flatten slightly and baked on parchment paper.

I had great succes with this recipe! Great texture and taste. This is also an excellent recipe to play with. The second time I made these, I added cherry gelatin and coconut and wound up with a DELICIOUS cookie. These are just perfect without tampering though. It's just fun when you find recipes that stand so well on their own, but also allow you endless possibilities for new things as well. Well done! I will be using this again....and again...and again!

These turned out just as described: soft and chewy. Only had to bake them for 11 mins though.  I sprinkled raw sugar on before and after baking to make them a little sweeter.

Very addictive!  THey are for sure soft and chewy.  The second time I made these, I frosted with regular white cake frosting and sprinkled with colored sugar.  I liked that batch better, but they both came out great. I will for sure keep this as my #1 sugar cookie recipe!

I didn't have the powder, so I used 1 and 1/s tsps. of baking soda instead and baked them for 8 minutes. I read other reviews first and also flattened them out a bit and sprinkled them with more sugar. This was a fantastic recipe and the cookies were crispy on the outside egdg and perfectly soft in the middle. Thanks for sharing...What a great cookie!

This was the first time I had used this website.  The cookies came out ok, a little too much salt though.  I didn't care for them as much as other people did.  I was looking for something more doughy and moist.  These were more greasy than I would've liked and they had more of a cake-like texture.  Also, if you do decide to use this recipe, make sure you make the cookies quite bigger than it asks because they don't get too much bigger when you bake them.

Exactly what I was looking for.  They were wonderful!  I did replace the white sugar with turbinado and only put organic sprinkles on top instead of rolling them in sugar.  These are especially good while they are still warm.  Thanks!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe to make. My only complaint is that the dough was rather dry & crumbly - I had to add extra liquid (milk) to make it pliable. Otherwise, delicious!

So this is going to sound like a weird review. I made these sugar cookies and took them for a gathering at a friend's house. Everyone loved them. They were soft and perfect. There weren't many of us, so not all of them were eaten, so I left them there in a ziploc container.

Months later (think almost a year), these cookies were found by my friend's husband. He just assumed she had gotten them, and he ate them. Apparently they were STILL delicious. It wasn't until she got home and he asked her about them when she remembered where they had come from.

So these are amazing. Forever.

Loved this recipe! I've tried making sugar cookies before and some of the other recipes can be so fussy to use with cookie cutters. This was so easy to make cute little cookie shapes with. The cookies held their shape really well as I was using the cutters on them and didn't stick like crazy to my cookie cutters. Also loved how soft and tasty these were. I had a bunch of friends over and got so many compliments on these.

This will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe from now on. I used the recipe for cut outs, so I chilled the dough four a couple of hours before rolling it out and it worked perfectly. The cookies had an excellent texture and taste. I paired with the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe on this site, and they ended up a masterpiece.  I cannot wait for Christmas! Thank you so much for sharing. **Keep in mind that these cookies are more of a "melt-in-your-mouth" soft as opposed to a cakey soft.

These were really good. I've never baked sugar cookies before (I'm a cake baker) and I followed the exact recipe. They turned out perfectly, a slight crunch at first and then chewy cookie overall - a really nice sugar cookie. I used these to make sugar skull cookies for the Dia de Los Muertos so they held up great with all the decorations. As a frosting base on the cookie before I decorated with icing, I (1) brushed melted butter on top of the cookie and dipped the top of the cookie in a cinnamon and sugar mix, and (2) melted mexican chocolate and put it on top of the cinnamon sugar mix. Once the chocolate was dry I was able to decorate the cookies with royal icing as usual. They were PHENOMENAL!!!! I baked at least 100 cookies and they were gone in mere minutes.

Great recipe, the only changes I made was to add the zest of one lemon to the creamed sugar/butter mixture. It adds an extra note of brightness to the cookies. I disagree with other reviewers who said that one teaspoon was too much salt. I think it might depend on how you are frosting the cookies as to whether one tsp is too much salt or not. I've used a chocolate ganache frosting and a vanilla confectioners frosting with colored sugar sprinkles and both of those super sweet frostings balanced out the salt content of the cookie quite perfectly.  I also chill the dough for at least 3 hours before scooping out into balls and then slightly flatten cookies with the bottom of a measuring cup dipped in flour. They bake perfectly every time, 11 minutes.  Let cool on cookie sheet for one minute and then transfer to wire rack to finish cooling.

These cookies are so good! I have made them 3 times already, and have come out great every time!!! I like the addition of rolling them in the sugar before baking them, it really adds a lot of sweetness to the cookie.  The only thing I changed while making this recipe was the shortening. Instead of shortening I substituted the shortening with butter, and it came out just fine, so if you don't have any shortening you can use butter. If you're looking for a quick and simple cookie recipe that doesn't require much skill or a trip to the food store for supplies, this one is it!

These were too salty. I wish I had made them a little bigger. 
Tasty, pretty easy and perfect for a plain old cookie craving.  Excellent texture.  Not too crumbly when you eat them. 
I had to bake them longer (about 14 minutes on middle shelf of oven) than stated.

Awesome recipe! I did follow the advice in a couple of other reviews. I used 1/2 tsp salt and use the bottom of a glass to press the dough balls into round cookie shapes. Cookies turned out soft and tasted like a cookie you would get from a bakery.

Made these with my 2 and 4 year olds. (They helped me measure and roll the balls of dough in the sugar.) My whole family agreed they were the absolute best sugar cookie we have tried. Absolutely delicious and I will not ever use another sugar cookie recipe.

I love this recipe! I have used it for years and it's always a big hit! I always use margarine instead of the butter and shortening, and I don't ever put salt in(something I picked up from my mom cooking) but they come out perfectly. This is also a recipe for adding coloring or making sandwiches out of.

Mine were excellent, and I just rolled the tops in chocolate jimmies and  some in coarse clear sugar before baking 10 minutes. They were NOT too salty as one comment suggested, which had me wary of making these. I creamed each step a bit longer than the video and sifted my dry ingredients prior to addition. I chilled the dough while I set out the decorations and in between batches,each batch came out more fluffy. These were both beautiful and delicious.

Pretty good! Used 1/2 tsp salt and substituted powdered sugar for granulated, and that creamed nicely with the butter and Crisco shortening. Nice recipe for quick/easy needs. Good job!

Alright I never write reviews on these things but  this recipe was amazballs. It was good. I personally don't like hard cookies so thought I'd give this a try. I alO did t have shortening so I skipped that step but they still turned out great. They do not Tripple in size they stay relatively proportionate to the balls that are made pre baking. Anywho worth a try there great especially with icing ontop as they aren't that sweet all alone.  recipie is a keeper. Thanks.

Mine turned out more on the crunchy side than soft side, but they were still good.  The only change I made is using 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract instead of 2 tsp vanilla, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I might cut the salt back a little bit next time too (I use unsalted butter), but that's just personal taste.  Overall a decent recipe though.

I doubled the recipe, adding a teaspoon of orange extract.  (I could've added more; I couldn't detect the flavor.) The dough seemed really dry and crumbly, but came together as I formed it into balls.  After the first batch came out of the oven still looking like balls, I flattened them out with my hands before dipping them into sprinkles. That did the trick. They are soft. I really like the simplicity of the recipe with no refrigeration.

Really good!  I used Crisco butter flavor for baking and so good!  Can also drizzle with a glaze (1/2C confectioners sugar + 3/4 tsp. vanilla or almond extract + 1 tsp. milk (or more to adjust consistency).

I halved the recipe and used just butter bc people reported tasting the shortening and I didn't want to chance it.  I agreed that the cookies tasted buttery and salty, very delicious but not very sweet. I glazed them with buttercream frosting I microwaved for a few seconds, then sprinkled with nonpareils.
One thing I want to point out is that I rolled out the dough to use a cookie cutter and while it was a bit sticky, rolling it out between wax paper and putting it in the freezer for a bit before cutting worked out fine.  I wish I could post a picture, they came out so great I'm making a whole batch today for my niece's first birthday party tomorrow!

Amazing!  Easy to make with the kids.  Made the cookies according to the recipe, except for adding under 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I will probably even add less salt, 1/4 teaspoon.  I always make rolled sugar cookies every season, but with having less time for baking I was looking for an alternative....these are definitely great to make and do not take much time at all!

This is the only recipe for sugar cookies I am "allowed" by family and friends to make. I also take them out before they truly brown and they turn out slightly gooey and awesome. If you brown the bottoms just dunk them in milk!

This recipe is 100 out of ten. If I could change anything though, add a little less salt. We used them for a thanksgiving party, and everyone loved them. The dough was soft, and delicious, I would recomend this to others.

Okay cookie. Definitely doesn't make 4 1/2 dozen unless you make them the size of a quarter. Nice flavor and very soft. I might make them again.

Just got the last batch out. Love them!!  I added a couple of drops of almond extract (because that's how I like them) and they turned out so good. Also I baked them with colored sprinkles. Mmm.

Truly the most delicious sugar cookie recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly!  Everybody loved them!  No need to frost them.  They are sweet enough with the colored sugar on top.  I will make this again!

I wanted a rolled sugar cookie for Valentine's day and decided to try this one even though you don't need to roll them. So glad I did. They were wonderful. I did make two small changes. I used only butter ( I substituted butter for shortning) and probably used 3 tsp vanilla. Delish!

I liked this recipe because you didn't have to roll them out.  It was easy for my 3 year to help me too!  I might also have put a pinch less salt, but that is personal taste.  I used margarine too, because I didn't have shortening and they were just fine.  I would make them again!

Good sugar cookies, but not spectacular. Not like the representative photo by the recipe. I wanted big, puffy, store-bought-looking cookies.  These were not pillowy soft. I followed the recipe (doubled) and tried all shapes, sizes, and baking times. None produced what it decribes. They ARE, however, delicous. I brought them to work and to a snowshoe and they disappeared. A friend suggested tying margarine instead of butter for more pillowness.

Yum! I am not usually one for sugar cookies, apart from the frosted ones you get from the grocery store, but these were great! I smooshed the tops down with a glass before baking when I made the second batch so that they would be flat and I could frost them. :)

This is a good basic sugar cookie recipe but like other posters I think I would cut back on the salt by at least half. Other than that they were good, not a lot of flavour, I might also add more vanilla or maybe almond flavoring if I make these again.

These were the best cookies ever!  My husband asked for a "soft sugar" cookie and these were perfect!  We made them for Christmas and my husband took them to work and they were a big hit!  We will be adding this to the list of cookies to make all the time for our kids lunches.

Finally a perfect sugar cookie! I baked them a little longer to assure they had a little crunch with a soft interior. They have just the right amount of vanilla flavor. I flattened the second plain batch a little so they can be easily frosted. Yum!

I made half a recipe and it came together very easy and would be great for first time bakers.  I followed exactly and unlike some of the reviewers, I did not find the salt to be too heavy. Make sure to mix the flour, salt and baking powder before adding to the wet ingredients.  In my oven these took about 11 minutes.  The mix of red and green sugar was our favorite.  Will definitely go on the cookie trays this year.

These cookies are the best tasting sugar cookies I've ever had. I would have said I didn't really like sugar cookies before I had these, but these have hanged my mind! They are delicious rolled in sugar or made into cut outs and iced. The balls stay softer, whereas the cutout cookies get crisp like you're probably used to. Fantastic recipe I will turn to for years to come!

A sugar cookie lover all my life, I made these heavenly cookies pretty much exactly to the recipe. The two exceptions are I made each ball a bit larger than a walnut (my yield was 44 cookies rather than 4 1/2 dozen), and flattened each ball to approximately 1/4 to 3/8 inch with a smooth bottom glass before baking for exactly 8 minutes. We've found that the longer these cookies remain in the cookie jar, the more delightfully developed the flavors become. One final note: a reviewer said that there was way too much salt in this recipe. We do not concur. The sweet/salty ratio is perfect in our opinion, and adds yet another dimension to savor. All this cookie ever needs is another glass of milk, please! Kudos to the creator.

This is the best recipe for sugar cookies, they are soft and taste wonderful. I use this recipe to make snicker doodles for our family. And there were no left overs for the next day. Wonderful cookies. June

This is your classic, perfect,  any holiday sugar cookie! You don't necessarily have to brown the bottoms to get them to be sturdy and soft at the same time. I rolled these and used cookie cutters. Just make sure to cut them at at least a quarter inch!

I made these for Christmas for the first time and I have to say, they definitely live up to their Blue Ribbon!  They were so soft and so very, very delicious!  Everyone raved over how good they were and this was the first variety of cookie to disappear. In fact, the kids actually asked me to make more of them! I was very impressed with the dough. I actually rolled these out and used Wilton cookie cutters. I had some trouble with the snowflakes but that was my fault for letting the dough get too warm.  Other than that, these were absolutely perfect!

I swear it's just me, but my cookies came out flat and really buttery. I followed the recipe exactly how it is. I even put the dough in the freezer to see if it would help stiffen them up. Other than that, they were yummy.

This recipe is awesome!  I will definitely make them again.  I followed the ingredients exactly and made snickerdoodles with it.  I did not roll them out though as the dough seemed too soft for that.  Instead, I formed them into balls.  I also chilled the dough for about two hours before forming them into balls to make the dough easier to handle. I baked them for 10 minutes and they turned out so soft and with just a little crispiness on the edges.  Perfecto!  

I saw where one review said that these are like the Lofthouse cookies. I didn't really think so.  Even though I made snickerdoodles with it, I could tell that the consistency isn't really like Lofthouse cookies. Still though, these are very, very good!

Fantastic. And, to the woman who claimed that was too much salt - I suggest she re-read her portion sizes because there is definitely not too much salt. Not even close. These cookies are incredibly soft (which is how I like my cookies anyway!) and they always turn out amazing. My entire family loves them, even my husband who doesn't even like to eat cookies period, let alone soft ones. He's a crunchy cookie type guy. I have made this recipe several times and I plan on making them many times more. A+

Way too much salt!! I would at LEAST half it next time! Also, if you don't want cookie balls, you must press the balls down (I used the underside of a big spoon). Maybe a seasoned sugar maker would know that, but I realized it halfway through! Other than that...delicious!!!!! PERFECT texture...slightly crunchy on the outside with a soft/cake-y inside...mmmmmm....almost makes up for too much salt! lol

GREAT RECIPE...A KEEPER! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes & then I rolled it out so that I could use my Christmas cookie cutters.  I did roll them to 1/4" thick.  I then baked these for 8 minutes...just slightly before they started to brown.  I then iced them with Allrecipes "Butter Icing for Cookies".

Best sugar cookie ever!  The flavor and consistency are fantastic and STAY that way even a week later!  This will be my go-to recipe for years to come. I frosted them with "Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies", also from this site.

These cookies were really good.  I made sure to flatten the cookies out with the bottom of a glass (after rolling and dipping in sugar) as some reviewers said they required this.   They are not the prettiest cookie as they puff up a lot and don't have that flat sugar cookie look, but they are super soft and chewy and the flavour is way better than a traditional sugar cookie.  The recipe made almost 5 dozen, and our family devoured them within 24 hours...need I say more?

Loved these cookies. Best tasting sugar cookies I've ever had. I must have done something a little wrong because when I took 1st batch out of oven they hadn't flattened out much at all, still almost a ball. For the remaining batches I rolled out the balls of dough and then flattened them with the palms of my hands. They all baked up perfectly in 10 minutes.

I made this recipe because I wanted a sugar cookie not a cutout. The dough was very crumbly making it necessary to pack it to make it hold together. The result was more dense than I wanted. Also they lacked flavor. Sorry, I won't make these again.

These turned out almost absolutely perfect! The ONLY down side was that there was TOO MUCH SALT. Next time half of a teaspoon will be enough. I mixed the sugar crystals with real sugar, and it allowed me to use less crystals and looked fine! Other than that, I just followed the recipe - no modifications.  The biggest tip I can give is this: when you are creaming the butter, shortening, and sugar, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT VERY, VERY FLUFFY! It makes a big difference. This is my new favorite sugar cookie recipe! I love the effect that the shortening AND butter have on the cookies!

It was a good recipe but I was really hoping that the cookies would be chewy. The cookies weren't hard but they weren't chewy like I wanted them to be. Maybe it's because I modified the recipe and used butter instead of shortening. I made the sugar coating purple by putting the sugar in a container with food coloring and then shaking it.

They had a nice appearance! Only minus a star because they aren't chewy. They definetly make 4 1/2 dozen cookies.

Perfect!  One of the best and easiest sugar cookie recipes ever!  I added the zest of one orange as one person suggested.  It worked out well, but you really tasted the orange.  Next time, I will follow the directions without any deviation.  This one is a keeper.

plain, boring, flavorless cookies. Even tried with frosting- not very good. Cookies came out fine I just did not like them, not worth the trouble.

This was a fantastic recipe!!  I actually tried a variation where I added Hershey's Heath bar bits and they turned out great!  This recipe can be used for as a base for things like Chocolate Chip cookies or Reese Chip Cookies!  It's so easy!  You just make it exactly as it says, then once you have the bowl of finished dough, just throw in a cup or two of chips!  Will definitely make these again!!

These cookies are so moist!  I frosted them and took them to a super bowl party and people raved about them.  People thought they were from a store bakery.  Very delicious and easy to make.

I gave this recipe 3 stars only because my sugar cookies came out very bland and not much taste. I am not sure if perhaps I did something wrong so I will give it another try. They did look great though. They did bake up and not out. I just need to work on the taste.

AMAZING. I am absolutely thrilled with these cookies. I have been on the hunt for a good sugar cookie recipe; every time I bake them, they turn to rocks. These are wonderful. The edges do get crisp, but the middle stays nice and moist. LOVE IT. Will be making this from now on.

This is my favorite sugar cookie recipe.  I've received many compliments on how delicious and perfect they were.  I bake the cookies for only 7 minutes and they come out perfect and chewy.  However, I do find that they are more delicate and break easier.  If you leave them in the oven for 8-9 minutes they will have more color but tend to get harder.  So it's all a matter of preference.   They are delicious either way!

excellent recipe! tweaked a bit; 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup splenda. dash of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. took enough dough for about 24 cookies  and added nutella to half of it and peanut butter to the other half effectively making delicious sugar cookies, peanut butter cookies, and chocolate hazelnut cookies with one versatile recipe! tiny cookies baked for 13 minutes

These are to die for.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The shortening gives the cookies a nice flaky texture that you don't get using just butter.  These will definitely be my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on.  Thanks so much.

These were the BEST sugar cookies I have had that were homemade!!!! After I had my twins 3yrs ago in another county I found these sugar cookies at the local safeway, they were sooo soft and the flavor was fantastic! And unfortunately my local safeway does not! :( So I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot (I suck at baking by the way)...and I added some homemade rasberry filling on the tops of the cookie by making thumbs indents. They were delish! after 10-12 min in the oven they were a perfect golden brown on the bottom and VERY sot and fluffy!!!! my husband and boys

These cookies are wonderful! The key is to not overcook them, pull out of oven before they golden- I bakes for 9 minutes and I used a tiny ice cream scoop for the size of my cookies. I then took a juice glass, dipped the bottom in sugar, and then pressed the cookie down slightly. I do think that 1 tsp is a tad too much salt, but like with everything else, that is based on my personal tastes.

Fast & Easy!  I didn't want to decorate so I took half of the sugar that was meant for decoration and added it to the dough.  I also used 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp almond flavoring.  Perfect!

I refridgerated the dough for about 2 hours before baking so the cookies would not flatten out. I also rolled the dough balls in some dyed sugar and placed them on the sheet without flattening them.

These cookies were just great! I used them for both drop cookies and roll out cookies, for the roll out cookies i put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes. But the results for both were amazing, i'm glad that I found a sugar cookie recipe that turns out better than the ones at the grocery store!

Where have these cookies been all my life??? I have searched forever to find a soft, bakery style sugar cookie, trying several recipes, and always disappointed with the outcome.  Not with this one. I followed the recipe as written, other than adding a bit more flour, and instead of rolling the dough in the sugar, I frosted them after baking with a cream cheese frosting.  These are FABULOUS!

Tip - watch the cookies closely.  You want to take them out of the oven just before they look completely done.  Let them cool on the cookie sheet completely.  They will stay soft for several days.

I love these cookies!! It took me alot of searching to pick a recipe. Thank u for posting this recipe and thank u to everyone who revirewed it. The reviews really decided it for me. I am really impressed. My house smelled like heaven! By far the best cookies i have baked. The are moist and soft like cake almost. I didnt frost all of them. They were so good without it. My 9yr old son was in heaven! I think we ate until we were on sugar over load. I will def be making these over and over.

This was my first time baking sugar cookies and I feel I did something wrong! By the time I had the sugar and butter creamed together with the eggs and vanilla stirred in, I was worried about adding 3 1/2 cups of flour because the liquid to dry ratio seemed to be off. I did and ended up with a crumbly mess. I added a little bit of water to help get the balls to form but my cookies came out cracked and ugly. I was not surprised! Any tips or help would be great. No idea where I went wrong.

In my opinion, this is the perfect sugar cookie: Puffy without being cakey, soft without being doughy, sweet but not sickly sweet. Actually they taste to me like smaller versions of those big unfrosted sugar cookies you get from Subway. I followed the recipe exactly except that instead of rolling them in sugar, I left them plain and plan to frost them for a Halloween party (though I'm only doing this to make them look cute, flavor-wise I don't think they need it!). I also used butter-flavor shortening. Sometimes I prefer a more delicate sugar cookie, but whenever I want a tasty, sturdy, basic one, this will be my go-to recipe from now on!

These cookies are fantastic! Just sweet enough, but not too sweet. Those of you who have a big sweet tooth might not find these sweet enough. My husband who "hates" sugar cookies LOVES these. I can never seem to make enough. They roll out well if you like to use cookie cutters. They are super soft and chewy.

Can be made vegan and are scrumptious!  A favorite for our egg- and dairy-allergic son.

We used our cookie press and they turned out great! I didn't have enough butter so I made them with 1/3 C butter and 1/3 C plus 2/3 C shortening and they still turned out perfectly! My 3yr old loved them, thanks for sharing :}

Not bad and nothing spectacular. Just your typical tried-and-true sugar cookie recipe. They didn't bake out the way I would have preferred- thin and flat. They were great straight from the oven (what cookie isn't?!). The bottoms were slightly crisp while the rest of the cookie melted with each bite. I always underbake my cookies, but this recipe did call for the perfect baking time. Ten minutes was all I needed. I was craving sugar cookies and these hit the spot.

My daughters and I just made these for a tea party.  They turned out crispy on the outside, puffy and soft on the inside.  We coated them with extra sugar after the first batch as they were not quite sweet enough for our taste.  I bet they would be delicious with a butter cream frosting!

I couldn't be happier with this recipe, I added about 1/2c. powdered sugar to the recipe. Also I added 1/2tsp baking soda and 1/2tsp cream of tartar instead of baking powder.  Best sugar cookies I've made :)

I loved making this recipe! It was the first homemade sugar cookie i've tried to make and they came out great! I made them about double the size it called for and this took the cooking time up to about 14 minutes but they still came out soft and delicious! Made about 2 and a half dozen large cookies.

These really can't be any more delicious!  Light and fluffy!  Everyone in the family loved them!  Made exactly how suggested.
Made them a second time.  Used half the dough a regular cookies.  The other half I added some more flour and rolled them out.  Not the greatest for rolled cookies because it's a soft dough, but still tasted fantastic!

These cookies were ok. The taste was good, but mine came out a bit dry. Could be an error on my part or just the recipe. But overall they were soft and chewy.

Made this recipe for the first time to bring in for an office potluck and everyone tried a cookie and nobody had a bad thing to say. I used butter flavored shortening and I made them smaller and got about 4 dozen. The only complaint I have heard is from my fiance who is upset I didn't leave more cookies home! Very tasty cookie for such an easy recipe.

Put a popsicle stick in it and it makes some great "loli pop" cookies :) Don't let them cool too long or they will get all hard. Great texture. Instead of sprinkling the colored sugar crystals on top, roll the crystals with the sugar and they turn out so perty :)

These are the best!  I actually used only 1 cup of sugar and they worked out great for my altitude.  I also topped it off with a powder sugar glaze instead of rolling it in sugar.

Tried these cookies yesterday and they were GREAT!!! Used for my Valentine cookies with pink sprinkles. Made no changes except for chilling them before baking. Will for sure make again.

This was a great tasting cookie. It was very easy to work with. I didnt even have to chill the dough to roll and cut out.  which keeps the kid entertained.  Although these were not what I was looking for, these are very tasty.  We like the store bought cookie thats cakey and fluffy.

These didn't turn out exactly as I thought they would (I was originally looking for a recipe for more cake-like cookies similar to the frosted ones sold at Kroger's bakery)... This recipe caught my interest though, so decided to give it a shot. Delicious! And I like the way the cookies can be thoroughly baked without having to turn the slightest bit brown, even on the bottom. 

I hand creamed the fats/sugar, and palm-rolled dough into small walnut-sized balls as called for in the recipe, but ended up with 3 dozen. Maybe rolled out and cut with cookie cutters would yield closer to 4 1/2 dozen, but unless I made a mistake somewhere I can't see getting 4 1/2 dozen out of this recipe.

Overall- easy, tasty, and had lots of fun making and decorating w/sprinkles with my 9-year-old son!

Perfect texture, easy to work with.  I love that you don't have to take time to refrigerate the dough.  Very good taste too.

I made this exactly by the recipe. They are an excellent cookie to work with! I rolled in cinnamon/sugar which are a must unless you plan to frost them. Not overly sweet which is just right. I my gas oven-15 minutes every time! It's a keeper for my famiy!

They are very tasty. I have celiac disease so I used gluten free flour to make these cookies. They didnt spread out, so I rolled them but they dont rise.

These cookies were good, very soft when they came out of the oven, and stayed soft too. We made them small so they were done sooner then normal.

I am teaching myself to bake at 29 yrs old. The last four or five recipes were so much more difficult then this one.  It was so easy my three yr old did most of the work he loved helping make them. And oh boy did he love eating them. It is wonderfully tasty and yet so very simple.

I read the reviews, but still tried the original recipe first. I followed it exactly as written and they turned out hard. I was expecting big fluffy chewy cookies. They taste wonderful, but I don't like hard cookies. I'm really bummed that they did not turn out like the picture or how they were described.

Perfect! I ran out of shortening after 1/3 cup, but butter worked just fine. I pressed the balls somewhat flat and only baked for seven minutes. They turned out wonderfully! I would eat them plain any day, but I'm sure they'll be great with icing too!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have tried. They were so moist and delicious!! Fantastic flavor and texture!! Also very simple to make. The dough is perfect for rolling out to make cut out cookies and also pinwheel cookies. I will be using this recipe for many, many years to come!!

The Dough is not what I thought it would be, it's more creamy then original cookie dough is. I LIKE IT.     I don't have to roll it. Saves time, and they're fluffy and soft! This has become my favorite sugar cookie recipe, now give me an icing that isn't a glaze and i'll be in heaven!

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  The cookies bake high and do not flatten out at all.  I rolled the dough for each cookie to walnut size and still they were puffy in the middle.  I pressed down the second batch and still they were small and puffy.  The texture was almost cake like after 20 min. being out of the oven.  The taste was good, not great. I would probably add a little more vanilla.

I love sugar cookies, but I hate rolling them out.  I am so glad I tried this recipe-soft, buttery, and so easy to make.  I made them as written, but I will try some variations around the Christmas holidays.  Excellent cookie!

Freaking awesome cookies! I totally goofed by using wheat (or so I thought) and these little babies came out just fine! Super soft just like I anticipated. I added a little brown sugar and rolled a few in cinnamon just for fun;)

These were awesome and I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of eggs, because on the the children I do daycare for, can't have eggs. They turned out perfect. The kids made these and needed very little help from me.

Even in my little toaster oven, these came out pretty good! The first batch was a little well-done on the bottoms because I can't preheat, but the subsequent batches came out great, despite being a tad bit more brown than desired. still yummy. the soft bite i was looking for.

These are exceptional!  I've made some pretty darn good sugar cookies before and my husband said these blow those away!  Thanks for a great recipe, didn't change a thing. They definitely do not spread out at all so if you want a little flatter cookie you will need to flatten with the bottom of a glass before baking. Thanks so much!

really easy to make and stayed soft. I used parchment paper and took them out just before they were completely done and left them on the cookie sheet for about a minute or two before putting htem on the rack. will definitely make again.

i planned on taking these cookies for my class. I really wanted them to turn out good for my class, so i made sure that i followed the exact recipe. They turned out not good at all. they were very heavy and thick, almost inedible. Even the middle of the cookie crumbled. no one in my famiy of 8 would eat them.

They turned out nice and soft. They still turned out tasty even though I made them way too big (recipe only made 26 cookies) I rolled them into large balls before baking and then frosted them with the decorating frosting recipe.

These are absolutely fantastic.  I took some of the tips from others, like I didn't use shortening.  But these came out amazing.  Laying out on the counter UNCOVERED for over a week and they were still soft and lovely each and every time I grabbed one.  Absolutely fantastic recipe.  Amazing cookies.  And I'm NOT a baker.

I have made these twice in two weeks.  They are a simple basic sugar cookie with a really good flavor.  The first time I made these the batch yielded 48 cookies small cookies.  The second time it yielded 3 dozen good size cookies. The recipe states 24 servings.  I am not sure what I did differently but if I made 24 cookies they would be huge.  This is a great recipe.  Give it a try.

Great recipe.  Sweet, but not overwhelming.  I decorated them with purple buttercream frosting and Easter sprinkles.  One thing I would note is that they do not change shape/expand much, so make sure they are in the nice pretty shapes you want before you bake them.  I had an ugly first batch. ;)

Everyone loved these cookies and they have been requested time and time again.  I did make some changes and they were that I used margarine instead of the shortening.  I added about 1/4 cup more sugar because I thought they could be a little sweeter and I also added a splash more vanilla just for flavor preferences.  Great cookies and very similar to the lofthouse cookies if you make them with the margarine!

This is an exceptional, easy recipe, and I now keep a log of these in the fridge for an occassional (and quick) after school treat or weeknight dessert.  Just slice, sugar and bake. My rating is based on the original recipe; I do however change it up now and then by adding a little extra vanilla or some lemon zest for more flavor.  My husband likes them best when they're rolled in cinnamon sugar.

These are perfection.  I have tried three different sugar cookie recipes recently, and these were the best.  Try them with the "Decorator frosting" recipe on this site.  WOW!  I actually used all butter instead of half butter/half shortening.  They were still very soft and delicious.

Very simple and tasty cookies.   The cookie has a nice flavor..not too sweet.   The cookie has a soft bite to it with a more crisp outside.  Only bake for the 12 minutes.   Cookies will be softer if you take off pan right away to cool on wire rack.  I was looking for an easy and tasty cookie to bring to my daughters school party and didn't want to deal with cutouts.   These are perfect!   Perfect with butter icing recipe on this site.

UPDATE 2: SENT MY FIANCE TO WORK W/ LEFTOVERS FRI. EVERYONE LOVED THEM (AND PASSED COMPLIMENTS TO HIM TO PASS ON TO ME!). UPDATE: THESE ROCK!!! REMINDS ME OF THE LOFTHOUSE COOKIES SOLD AT THE GROCERY STORE (AND THEY ODDLY TASTE SWEETER THAN I REM DAYS AGO). OH, AND THEY ARE STILL SUPER SOFT!!! These are pretty good. I prefer sweeter cookies, but for how easy these are to make, I am happy w/ the outcoome. I'm a sucker for Cheryl & Co.'s sugar cookies, & was hoping for a cookie similar to theirs (you know, those pre-wrapped cookies that come in the mail at Cmas...), but these didn't quite hit the mark.... One thing to note: If you do not store your cookies soon after pulling them out of the oven (I used my air-tight Tupperware container), they will bcome crumbly. Be mindful of that. I followed Laura's direct. to the ltr. w/ the except. of 1 step. Aft. seeing that these bake high & pouffy (they do not spread at all), I decided to slightly flatten my next 3 batches - yes, I got DOUBLE the amt. of cookies sugg. (I even rolled into walnut sze. balls as direct., using my sm. PC scoop for uniform.)!!!! I ended up dipping 1/2 of my cookies in red decorator's sugar (b4 baking) & baked the other 1/2 plain & then frosted w/ pink tinted vanilla frosting (from the can) & sprinkled w/ red sugar. My cookies baked up perfectly in 12 min., but watch carefully after 8-10 min. as everyone's oven temps vary. All in all, these were a nice add. to my V Day cookie tray. T you for sharing! :-)

Very good cookies.  I only used a teaspoon for the batter for each cookie and they are the perfect size.  I took the advice of another review and used softened margarine instead of butter -- perfect!

The best sugar cookie recipe EVER!   These turned out perfect!  Nice and soft not overly sweet so you can enjoy with icing.  We think they are better than the Lofthouse Cookies!  Followed the recipe exactly and had no problem rolling them out and using cookie cutters.  With the left over dough I rolled them in a ball and then flattened the ball some with my palm efore baking, as I just didn't think the would "melt" into a flat cookie as the cookies pretty much stayed in the original shape except they puffed up a bit.   New favorite recipe and big hit with family and friends!

Fantastic! Great flavor and super soft. I flattened my cookies slightly and baked for 8 minutes. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

The texture and flavor of these are wonderful! I followed the recipe to a"t" and they came out perfect!  I coated half in granulated sugar, but the rest I left plain to add a dollop of frosting and a cherry :) Both were great!  I did keep the dough in the fridge between batches though. Not sure if it made much of a difference but just wanted to make sure they stayed a good consistency.  Make sure you do cream the soft ingredients very well  until fluffy (just with a spoon though) and DO take them out at 10 mins. They may look a smidgen undercooked, but by the time they cool for a few minutes on the pan and you transfer them to rack they stay perfect (even the next day)!

The perfect sugar cookie- point blank and simple. The only change I made was putting the dough into the fridge for an hour to chill for easier rolling later on. I topped the cookies with a cream cheese icing (2 tablespoons cream cheese, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/4 tsp almond extract, and 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar over a double broiler) and sprinkles.

Finally found a recipe that I like.  Buttery, soft, sugary, and oh so delicious!  My only challenge was not having the right amounts of shortening and butter on hand, so I used what I had and added 6T of margarine and they are still GREAT!

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made this many times, always with great results. Great for simple rolled cookies or for cutouts. As a previous review stated, this recipe is not an overly sweet cookie, you can taste the savory salt. Delish!!

I used the butter flavored shortening for more flavor, as someone else suggested.  They "tasted" good, but weren't "soft" or "chewy" as I'd hoped.  Someone else said they reminded them of a buscuit consistency, which is exactly what they reminded me of.  I followed everything to a "T" but for some reason the cookies didn't flatten out.  They more or less stayed pretty close to their initial "ball shape" that we rolled them into.  I tried rolling them into balls with the dough at room temperature as well as refrigerated.  Same result either way.  Tried helping them along by flattening them with a fork.  Still didn't spread out, and stayed the way I flattened them.  I've seen other recipes that don't call for shortening, so I'm wondering if maybe that had something to do with the results??

Made four dozen of these for my children's school Christmas parties. The dough was very easy to make and work with. I rolled them in sugar and then flattened them a little between my hands. and finished them with colored sugar sprinkles.  Delicious! Don't overbake because they dry out.

Delich! The dough was so nice and easy to work with and the cookies were great and made a nice size batch of small cookies (as long as you don't do too much snacking on the dough)! Thank you!

Best Sugar cookie recipe I've made yet! Still soft and chewy the next day and it was easy enough to alter for a nice variation of cookies. :) I ended up dipping some in melted chocolate(I recommend Dolchi Frutta chocolate dots. I only covered half of the cookie for more of a fancy look), covered quite a few in cream cheese frosting, and then leaving the others plain(but with cinnamon added to the sugar topping to make them more like snickerdoodles.). Each was absolutely delicious! The boyfriend had at least seven in one sitting, so it passes the test ;)  I'll be making this again for parties and holiday occasions.

First time using this recipe and absolutely loved it.  I followed it exactly and they turned out wonderfully.  My husband and 3 yr old daughter loved them also.  My husband called them "elegant" and said they are a must for Christmas.

This was WAYYY to buttery and salty. I would cut the butter/shortening down to 1 cup total! and make sure you use UNSALTED butter and only use 1/2 tsp. of salt.. I MAY make these again, if I do I will follow my previous ideas.  I will say that the appearance of the cookies is phenomeonal and they baked perfectly.. just the taste was very (!) off..

AWESOME COOKIES!!! Look no further for the perfect sugar cookie recipe. I made them according to the recipe, slightly flattened the dough balls with a glass, then decorated with cookie icing and sprinkles after they cooled. Great cookies! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like the thickness as they didn't get done in the middle.  Think I would flatten the ball some so they would not be as thick & doughy in the center.

Very soft and good. They were a touch salty for my tatse so next time I'll just put 1/2 a tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp. I also put 1 3/4 vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of the 2 tsp of vanilla just to switch up the flavor a bit and it made the cookies even better.

I have been searching and searching for the perfect sugar cookie, I've made a couple from this site but l still haven't found the *perfect* one. This recipe needs to cut the salt at least by half. I used UNsalted butter and just added the 1tsp but it was overkill. All you can taste is salt. Ridiculous that it has this many good reviews! Will not make again.

Just what I was looking for. The cookies aren't too sweet so can handle a bit of frosting or sugar. Easy  to think of add ins like lemon or orange zest or extracts  like almond lemon or rum. Don't leave out the shortening part of why it's soft. I  used a cookie scoop to drop on  pans easier than rolling into  balls. They are done when edges are slightly brown. Be sure to  cream butter  and  sugar  well and use fresh  baking powder!

The batch I made gave me about 35 cookies. They were so delicious! I will definatley save this recipe and make it again. They were the best homemade i have ever had. I didnt roll them in sugar, just put on the colored sugar sprinkles on top. Amazing. :)

Ok, I am a sugar cookie NUT, and I love this recipe.  I put them in a bag after cooling and frosted them the next day. The cookies are perfect after letting them sit.  I ate them after cooling and wasn't impressed; however, they were AMAZING the next day. I rolled them out which was easy, but I had a hard time getting them off the mat onto the pan without misshaping the cutouts.  I put them in the fridge and it helped.  You won't be disappointed with this cookie, I promise!

These cookies look plain without frosting, but they taste outta this world. If you add chocolate chips, it just makes them better! They taste good even without the extra sugar for the outer coating. Just margarine and/or butter works fine for this recipe.

This is my new favorite sugar cookie recipe!  It is just like the sugar cookie dough you buy in the market, only better because it's real ingredients!  The recipe made a lot, too.  Great!

WOW!!!  This is a fantastic recipe!!  It really does make at least 24 LARGE cookies!! The cookies are fluffy but still very moist.  They're plump and really do look like the picture!  I rolled them in brown sugar and it just added to the goodness!!  FANTASTIC!! I will definately make these again!! Thank you so much!  :)

These were some of the best sugar cookies I've ever made! We didn't have any shortening on hand so we just substituted it for more butter. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are so yummy! Nice soft and sweet but not too sweet! I followed all the suggestions, creamed butter, shortening and sugar very well before adding eggs. Then chilled the cookie dough before balling. This recipe is a keeper!

Great and Yummy! How can this be? if you want bigger cookies then don't go with the tablespoon size, these babies don't expand much. But utterly chewy and tasty fresh from the oven.

These were outstanding!  The texture and flavor were really good.  Since I was being lazy and didn't want to measure out both the butter and shortening, I used 1 c (3/3 as opposed to 2/3) and lowered the amount of shortening to 1/3 cup.  They turned out fine.  Since these don't spread, be sure to use the back of a measuring cup to smash them down.  We made 3 different batches, one with just plain sugar, one with the cinnamon sugar mixture and the last set using "Sugar Cookie Icing" from this site.  All were amazing.  I do suggest if you use the cinnamon sugar mixture, to roll them in it while it is a ball, then flatten it on the cookie sheet and then sprinkle some more cinnamon sugar on it.  I highly recommend this to everyone!

Great cookie!  Super easy! I followed other advice and made sure the butter was room temperature (real butter - unsalted) so it whips up nicely.  I followed the recipe exactly, split the dough in half and mixed in  1 tsp. of culinary lavender for half the batch because I'd been curious about lavender cookies...either way they were great.

This recipe is fantastic.Being simple and easy to prepare.Half of the first batch out of the oven was gone before the second one came out. I read other reviews and decided what I wanted. I used 2/3 cup butter instead of margarine which gave them the buttery taste we love. I also did 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I creamed the shortening,butter and sugar until really very ligt and fluffy. These are excellent and this is a winner and keep in our books.

Best, softest sugar cookies ever! I used all butter 1 and 1/3 cups, so it turned out fine without the shortening. They do not spread at all, so if you want them flat to spread frosting/icing, flatten them with your hands after rolling them into balls. Great recipe!

Very good cookie. I had to use whole wheat flour. I was worried that they would turn out heavy, but they were light, soft in the center, somewhat chewy, with a soft center. Just the way we like them.

I made this recipe gluten free by substituting gluten-free flour where it called for regular and it turned out amazing!  I will definitely be using this recipe again, the kids LOVED it!!  The gluten free flour mix I use is: 2 cups rice flour; 2/3 cup potato starch; 1/3 cup tapioca flour; 1 tsp xantham gum.  Thanks!!

fantastic recipe - best sugar cookies ive tried .. very soft in texture.. I rolled mine in plain sugar as well as a cinnamon sugar mixture - only advice I'd give is to make sure you cream your ingredients properly until light in color and fluffy - VERY IMPORTANT! and do not overbake!

I really loved making these cookies, as they were easy to prepare and tasted great! What I ended up doing was making the dough into about 1-inch balls and freezing them, so I could have a few cookies whenever I wanted instead of a whole batch just sitting there staring me in the face- lol. They still tasted great after being frozen and I didn't even frost them!

This is my first review, and all I can say is..."WOW!!".  I have been trying to find a good Sugar Cookie recipe for years - okay, decades.  This recipe did not need to be tweaked or altered, and the dough came out beautifully. Even my 13-year old daughter was able to roll and use cutter cutters on it. I couldn't be happier because this recipe is the light at the end of the tunnel...which will save me hours of painless cookie making for my kids classes, for potlucks at work, and "just because cookies" for home. THANK YOU!!!

I made these cookies last night.  They are the best sugar cookies we ever had!  My husband is very picky about his cookies and he kept telling me how much he loved them.  The funny thing is he did not want me to make these because it said soft sugar cookies. He likes them crunchy.  See you can teach an old dog new tricks! :-)~

Amazing! My toddlers were bored this afternoon, so we decided to make some purple cookies (read as: sugar cookies mixed with red and blue food coloring) and these were a smash hit! PERFECT texture and consistency--crisp around the edges but ultra soft and fluffy on the inside--the ideal sugar cookie. I added a tiny bit more sugar to the recipe after reading they weren't too sweet based off the recipe--just a hint--and they were perfect for our tastes. I also rolled the cookies into balls, rolled said balls in sugar, and flattened them slightly with a drinking glass. When baked between 8-9 minutes, they were perfect. Definitely the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried. This one is a keeper! :)

I was looking for those really fluffy small white cookies. I liked these cookies, but they weren't exactly what I was looking for. I didn't frost them, and froze half the dough for another use.

Very good.  They have a nice taste to them.  They are soft on the inside which is a plus.  I got tons of compliments on them when I brought them to a Christmas party. I cooked them for about 15 minutes instead of 10-12.  I also tried rolling some in cinnamon sugar and they were delicious.

Very similar to Lofthouse cookies, especially with frosting and sprinkles.  My only complaint is that they seemed a tad on the salty side.  The sweet frosting cut the saltiness, but next time I will try reducing the salt a bit.  Also, don't wait to pull them out until they are browned if you want to keep them soft.

I give you a quote from a coworker: "These were the best sugar cookie I have ever had!  I love that they were not flat and they were so moist!  PERFECT!"  Everyone at work RAVED about these cookies! They are buttery, sugary, and oh-so-yummy! Followed EXACTLY as written, adding a sprinkle of "sugar in the raw" to give it the extra special attention. A blue ribbon winner indeed =)

These cookies are delicious. Make sure you cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp and bake for only 8 minutes. Any longer and they will be burnt.

I am big on textures when it comes to food, and these were wonderful! I love that they were almost cake like. The flavor was like any other sugar cookie, but the texture was what won it for me!

These were a soft sugar cookie. The key to great soft texture is to not cook to long. I would suggest not letting them brown. As soon as I saw the slightest and I mean slightest hint of color I took them out and let them cool for at least 2o mins before removing from the pan. I was afraid to under cook them and let the first batch turn golden all around the edges and did not like the crunchy effect. I topped with frosting. 
next time I may add almond extract or lemon extract, flavor is pretty plain.

First let me say I love these cookies.  The only thing I do different is add a tablespoon of lemon extract as well as the vanilla, I use pure,yes you can tell the difference.I also like to cream butter and the rest of the wet ingredients for about five minutes. For an added touch I drizzle with white choc. I also use parchment paper to bake my cookies.

Wow, I think I found my new sugar cookie recipe. :) These are awesome. I put lemon curd on some of them, but really, they taste wonderful on their own. 
And I loved that I didn't have to take the time to refrigerate and roll them out.

These are fine, but I would recommend frosting them, not just rolling in sugar because they are not sweet enough by themselves.

Absolutely Perfect! I make roll out sugar cookies every christmas and dont even touch them because they are pretty but dont taste good. These drop style cookies are amazing....maybe not so pretty but who cares? When I make cookies my 3 1/2 year old will take one bite and that'll be it. With these he ran off with one and came back so quickly for another I thought he must have hidden it...but to my suprise...he ate that one and a whole second! These cookies are Brandon approved! I also wanted to add: big hit with everyone and I was asked to bring them for Thanksgiving!

Cannot believe how easy and yummy! I used a cookie scoop and dropped them right on the sheet. They do come out looking pretty much the same as going in, but a little frosting made them gorgeous and even more delicious (used "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting"). Don't over bake or over mix and they will come out soft and perfect.

This is just the recipe I was looking for! I have my faithful cut-out recipe but was looking for a drop one and this is now part of my collection.  I will say to make sure you do not over mix the dry in to the cream mixture. Only mix until the dough comes together. Over mixing will lead to a cookies that will not rise. I also flattened my quite a bit with a bottom of a glass because they do not spread a lot. I just added colored sugar to the tops and got my glass of milk ready!  Thanks!

I had my doubts about these initially, as they just seemed "too good to be true"- drop cookies instead of roll-out, basic ingreedients, simple recipe overall...but these are hands-down the best sugar cookies I've ever made. They're easy *and* they turn out better than any other recipe I've tried, which are usually flat, dense, and plain. These are light, fluffy, and SOFT just like the ones you buy in a bakery. I didn't roll them in sugar, just left them as plain walnut sized balls (I make them pretty large) and frost them in white "whipped" frosting, with a few rainbow sprinkles on top :) Always a favorite! Thanks for this incredible recipe!

These were a really good cookie. They taste more like a butter cookie to me, but still very good. I dipped some of mine in colored sugar before baking and the other half I frosted with buttercream frosting from this site. While these are good, they were not what I was looking for. Thanks for the recipe though!

I made these cookies today, after looking at many other recipes. They were great because I didn't have to run to the store to get anything. After I mixed it all together, I had enough for 3 cookie sheets. The first batch, the dough was hard to roll in my hand because it was very sticky so I put it in the fridge for batches 2 & 3. That made it a whole lot easier. I sprinkled crystal sprinkles over the top before I baked them. I haven't tried them (gave em up for Lent) but my family is going to try them later. They smell great!

I was so amazed at how wonderful this recipe realy is. I did add  a half cup more sugar before baking and a smidge of more vanilla. 
The creaming of the butter and shortening was easier for me when I softened it up to almost liquid. 
I cooked for ten exactly and it was absolute devine. 
Thank you who ever posted this. Thank you and my whole family screams thank you too.

I had always been jelous of Publix sugar cookies. Never again. Smiles.

These turned out great!  I took the advise of another person and chilled the dough before rolling into the balls and they turned out perfect.  In my opinion there is no need for frosting, but they look cute that way.  We rolled a few in colored sugar and they turned out darling for my son's preschool.

This was a good recipe as stated.  I used butter flavored shortening, and they tasted great, and stayed soft for days.  Used my cookie scoop and baked for 13 minutes, which was perfect.  Next time I'll frost them with something, for some more flavor.

I am giving these 5 stars even though I haven't tasted them.  I have given up sweets for Lent so not a bite has passed my lips.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and the dough was easy to work with and they baked up beautifully!  I sprinkled each cookie with additional sugar after I pulled them out of the oven then allowed them to cool on the sheets for 3 or 4 minutes.  They looked perfect, exactly like the ones I used to eat from bakeries.  My husband is the taster and so he will be the final judge.  My 5-year-old daughter liked them but hers is not the most discerning palate - if it is sweet, she likes it!  I will definitely be making these again.

These are so good!  I made 1/2 recipe and got 22 cookies out of it (balls of about 1" diameter before baking.)  If baked just until they barely start to turn brown - or just before that - they will stay soft for days.  The granulated sugar on the outside puts these over the top.  Yum!

These were really good! I used this one because I hate to roll out cookie dough-but I love sugar cookies-so this one was great for me.  I would give it five stars with frosting-which I added-Sour Cream Frosting from this site-they were very tasty!

These cookies have a great flavor. I liked the fact that they don't call for very many ingred. and the ones that it calls for are your eveyday things. I did notice one thing though, and that is that you can't overbake them, not even a little bit because they harden up. So because I decided to do roll cookies from this recipe, I had to watch them very carefully. I used cold butter right from the refrigerator so they rolled out nicely. All and all this is a good recipe. I keeping it!

This was my first time making sugar cookies and I must say these cookies were great but I expected better but me and my family still enjoyed them. Further more they were still great and they'll be cookies that I'll bake often. Thanks..^_^

If you are looking for a very basic, kindof bland cookie, this is it. This is a very good recipe to build off of, but I have made them twice now and found them to be more like soft, sweet butter cookies. They do form very well, though, and would be great for a beginner baker or for children.

Terrific basic cookie recipe. Good just as is, but a great blank canvas for tweaking. Add spices, different sugars, "mixings".. whatever.

These cookies are GREAT. I dont normally eat sugar cookies. My daughter has made these twice this week. A few tips.. Decrease the salt. You could really taste it in the first batch. Perfect the second time ,with the salt adjustment.
I think the key with these cookies are to roll them out, or make sure they are thick cookies. If you are looking for a soft cookie. Do not OVER BAKE. Let them cool on a WIRE RACK, This is a must have in cookie baking to prevent carry over baking. Which can cause dry hard cookies.
DONT LOOK FOR ANOTHER SUGAR COOKIE RECIPE THIS ONE WONT LET YOU DOWN. 
I used butter flavor shortening and butter, other than that I just decreased the salt. Enjoy!!!!

very soft on the inside (esp when you don't flatten the dough); crisp edges.  i prepared the batter, made half (with small balls of dough), and then refrigerated the rest for the following day.  the 2nd batch was just as good as the first, but i flattened the dough this time.  (baked 11 mins and cooled on a cookie rack).  overall made 5dozen small cookies.

Terrific recipe! The kids had a terrific time making these. I did add a little extra vanilla, as I like a more flavorful cookie. Other than that, they were excellent hot out of the oven. I also flattened them with a glass as someone else said, and they cooked up wonderfully. Will try rolling them and cutting them next just for kicks!

Easy and quick to make and taste good too!  Used bread flour (it was all I had on hand) and they were a bit tall.  I smashed the remaining ones down a bit and they were perfect.  Also cut down the recipe to 24 servings and they were still excellent.

I consider myself a pretty experienced cook/baker, but I've never made sugar cookies until today.  I rolled out half the batch and used Christmas cookie cutters and frosted them, the other half I rolled and pressed with colored granulated sugar.  They were equally good.  I chose this recipe b/c they were "soft" sugar cookies, but honestly I didn't find them to be very soft. A couple of my batches hardly browned on the bottom and they still came out rather crunchy.  (Maybe I didn't make them thick enough?)  But having said that, I thought they were very very good and will make them again.

This cookie is excellent.  My children love sugar cookies, I have tried several recipes but this one by far blows them away!  And that doesn't even come close to how easy they are....WOW!!  The first batch I just dipped the tops in colored sugar but have to make another recipe that will hopefully make it to the freezer this time...lol  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  I think I will try icing some of the next batch.

Soft and delicious!!! Used all butter flavor crisco and no butter. Also used 2 cups of sugar. Had to add 3 T milk because of these changes. Added 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Baked at 400 for 8 min and they turned out perfect.

This is a great recipe. I don't care for crispy hard cookies. So I was excited to find this recipe. One thing I will say is that when I made these I dropped them with a standard size disher (size 20 I think. really just a large melon baller.)and baked them for 10 to 12 minutes like the recipe said but they were not finished. I ended up having to bake them for a total of about 15 minutes. After that they were perfect. I think this recipe's author has an oven that runs hot because mine has a thermometer in it and is accurate so be careful. As for the taste I might add more sugar or an extract or orange zest for added flavor and sweetness. These cookies also don't spread very much so mash them down a bit if you like.

I love these cookies made just as the recipe says.  I do make an addition that has caused my family to request these cookies for every single holiday.  Instead of rolling them in sugar, I bake them without.  I then frost them with a simple almond frosting, then place three M&M's in the frosting.  They are incredibly good like this.  All of the people that said this cookie was too bland should try them with this addition.  A medium sized cookie scoop makes this already simple recipe even easier - it also is the perfect size for 3 M&M's in the frosting.

Added a splash of almond extract and rolled in a mix of sugar and cinnamon.  These turned out delicious, with a subtle flavor that wasn't very sweet.  I baked them a couple of extra minutes (14-15) for a crisp exterior, but when stored in an airtight container they became soft and chewy.  Great either way.

These are great cookies.  They are nice and soft.  I used 3 teaspoons vanilla for more flavor and added a 1/4 c. of sugar as previous poster suggested. The dough was pretty sticky at first but after 10 min or so in the fridge it was pretty easy to handle. I also used a spatula, as a previous reviewer suggested, to smash down the cookies a little bit so they wouldn't be so round.  They disappeared fast! My sister couldn't stop eating them and she dosen't really like sugar cookies. Will make again.

These were some of the  best sugar cookies I've ever had. The best part was not having to chill the dough. They came out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. I think I scarfed down at least a dozen fresh out of the oven.

This was so easy! I've made the recipe twice, once as recipe calls (in balls, and the second time I used my cookie press. This dough works excellent in the press. I've had problems with other doughs being to sticky in it, but this was perfect. It literally took about 5 min to place all dough on my cookie sheets with my cookie press. I then sprinkled sugar on top and baked. I do recommend using an aluminum pan. Turns out super soft and light on the bottoms. Thanks so much!

These were definately soft but I didn't find them too chewy. They aren't too sweet so for hot tea drinkers I imagine they are the perfect cookie! (Maybe they'd be good with cocoa too) I added a lil colored sugar to the sugar I rolled them in since it's the holidays and they look lovely. All I did different was add extra vanilla.

Thank you Laura Stearns for the best cookies I ever tasted. They were easy and outstanding. But I added a little almond and they still tasted great and they have an old fashioned taste.

Wonderful taste and chewy texture! You can make any variety, just sub a flavoring for the vanilla or roll some in sugar and cinnamon for Snickerdoodles. You can even skip the rolling and drop by tablespoons and they are still great.

This is one of the easiest and best sugar cookies I have made. I will deffinately be using it again.I made it exactly to the recipe with no problems without chilling the dough. However for myself I will reduce the salt next time I found I could taste the salt and I don't like that but some people do.

This cookie isn't bad, but I don't really like the way the flavor of the Crisco comes out so strongly in the cookie.  Perhaps it needs butter flavored Crisco, rather than the original that I used?  They started to harden within 30 minutes of being baked, so they aren't really soft, but they are chewy. Also, I got 45 walnut shaped balls, and the recipe is for 24.  I used red and green sugar and only dipped the tops of the cookies.  I was looking for some new additions to my Christmas cookie line up, but as is, I wouldn't serve them to guests.  I might try these again with some changes to the original recipe.

The PERFECT sugar cookie!  Made exactly as recipe said and they came out soft, chewy and delicious!  I had some brown sugar/cinnamon mixture left over from another recipe and I rolled some of the cookies in that instead of white sugar and they turned out wonderful (2 tbsp brown sugar mixed with 1 tsp cinnamon).  I also topped some of the cookies with 3 chocolate chips as soon as they came out of the oven.  3 different (sort of) cookies in one batch!

These were just what I was looking for.  My kids & I all love them!  Already a new family favorite.  I made them the size of golf balls, as I had seen recommended by other reviews, and it yielded 3 1/2 dozen.  Will definitely make these again & again.  THANKS FOR SUCH A YUMMY RECIPE!

Every cookie in my entire batch turned out perfectly chewy and soft.  I rolled golf ball sized balls into sugar and once on the baking sheet I smooshed them down with the bottom of a glass.  My family loved them!

This cookies are so yummy - they really were nice and soft for days.  I made a few modifications that I recommend:  I made these for Halloween, so I frosted them with an orange butter frosting.  To avoid them begin too sweet, I nixed the 1/3 cup of sugar used to for coating.  I also added about a teaspoon of cardamom and a teaspoon of nutmeg to give them a little kick.  Yummy...

Wow - these are wonderful! I have many sugar cookie recipes, but this one is by far my new favorite. Most others turn out crisp, which can be delicious, but I've been searching for a good SOFT sugar cookie recipe - this one was everything promised. I was out of vanilla (but I often leave that out of recipes), and I use self-rising flour instead of all-purpose & baking powder & salt. Those were the only things I did different from the recipe & these were delicious! Thanks so much for a new addition to my recipe collection.

I spent weeks looking for a sugar cookie recipe that didn't need rolled and I came across this recipe.  This was exactly what I was looking for, these are so easy to make and so delicious.  My son keeps asking for them.  My first dozen came out of the oven and didn't spread, and then I remembered reading that other people had flattened them first, so I did that with the rest of them and they came out perfect!  I will definitely make these the next time my family asks for sugar cookies.

I made this recipe last yr. but neglected to rate it. It deserves rating!  Wonderful taste and texture! I rolled some in green/red sugar, and left some plain, so I could frost with buttercreme icing. I did flatten out the balls with a tablespoon. My family loves them.
Thanks for sharing Laura

Ok, all I have to say about these cookies that they should be a secret family recipe---we loved them so much we would never want other people to know their simple secret. I even gave some to a culinary student and they thought they were excellent as well. I tried some flattened, but it was a no-go because it ruined the extraordinary fluffiness of the cookie. I also added some marachino cherry juice to some and used a sugar cookie frosting and they were a total die-for!

Great cookies.  I found that I needed to bake a little longer.  But, then, everything I've made since I decided to try my hand at baking has been that way.  I figure I can chalk it up to oven variance.  In any case, the cookies came out fine, and the only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star recipe in my book is the fact that I'm a peanut butter/chocolate freak...and these ain't that.  But, I will pass this one along, and keep it for future reference.  Particularly at Christmas time.

These are awesome!!! I expected them to run all the way to flat but they keep good height.  This actually means that you can take a teaspoon and after rolling the dough in colored sugar or whatever (multi-colored all mixed together is fun)you can press the little doughball into a teaspoon and create an eggshape-  they will look like multicolored oval half Easter eggs!  :)

Absolutely my daughter's favorite cookie.  I make them in huge quantities for school activities and the last batch comes out just like the first.  They have a wonderfuly simple buttery flavor.  Always soft and chewy.

These sugar tasted really good, but the dough was extremely thin and could not be molded or shaped.  I had to add an extra 2/3 cup flour to thicken it.  Overall they tasted good, even better with frosting.

This is a great recipe.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Especially good with frosting. I have already passed this on to friends.

These sugar cookies were very cake like. My boyfriend and I found them to be too bland. 
Next time I will add some almond extract for more flavor. I tried orange extract and cinnamon but it was still too bland.  Would also taste great with some iceing!!

AWESOME recipe!  It's a family favorite!  I rated it a 4 because I had to go 1/2 cup less on the flour and use a whole stick of butter so it wouldn't be so chalky, otherwise I would've given this a full 5.

First time making sugar cookies from scratch.  I used all butter.  I also added s 1/2 tsp of almond to the vanilla.  Delicious recipe.  Seemed to me even better next day.

This is my sugar cookie recipe from now on. I used it for rolled out cookies and it works great and they stay soft forever! Okay, not like FOREVER but until they got eaten. Flavor is perfect, not too sweet, but sweet enough to be eaten without frosting if you want.

These are fantastic!! I made these and was in the mood for a lemon cookie so I used lemon extract rather than vanilla BUT I can tell by the texture and taste of the cookie that they would be phenomenal sugar cookies. They are soft and moist. The recipe didn’t specify the consistency of the butter. I used it straight from the fridge and my mixture didn’t form well for me, stayed crumbly, so I reached in a used my hands. Came out perfect.

I tried to use this for cookie cutters, the dough was really soft and I struggled. However, I am newish to baking. A friend suggested putting the dough in the fridge for an hour then try again. It helped but was still not much better. If you are going to make these I would stick to the balls, per the recipe, unless you are a seasoned baker. They were not very sweet. You need to ice them for sure.  I think if I had more experience under my belt it would have gone better.

Cookies themselves are delicious.  Dough was not suitable for cutting cookies.  The recipe did say to make drop cookies, but other reviews indicated it was good for rolling out.  I had to make extra thick cookies (1/2") to get any decent cut outs.

I used all butter and half the salt. Rolled out the dough to use cookie cutters. Came out with good texture and softness. I’ll add some stuff next time to add more flavor, like almond or lemon extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Cookies tasted more like a buttery shortbread cookie than a sugar cookie. I was also surprised that the cookies did not rise or expand so stayed in balls (which is not a big deal). The cookies were too buttery for me but I still ate a few and my 4 year old did not like them but finished one or two. The recipe makes over 50 cookies.

I wanted to make the cookies harder, so I extended the baking time on a baking stone from 12 to about 18 minutes, and the sugar cookies really firmed up nicely. Since the cookies don't flatten out too much as others had mentioned, I simply used my fingers to flatten the dough. The sugar helps keep the cookies from sticking.

I did everything that the recipe called for and creamed my butter and shortning  with the sugar but it turned out really dry. It was impossible to roll out  and the cookie dough fell apart when we rolled them into balls. They didn't flaten in the baking prosess. I would up using a 1/4 of a cup oil to save all the work we put into the dough but I wouldn't make them again.

Excellent recipe, I have made these several times.  After they are rolled in sugar, mash with a glass.  Use different colors of  sugar for different holidays.

We made rolled cookies.  I made the recipe just as written except I did not have plain vanilla.  I used butter vanilla from Watkins.  I also divided the dough into two pieces and wrapped it in plastic wrap and refrigerated for an hour before we rolled it out.  The cookies were perfect at 11 minutes and they did not spread.  My grandkids had a blast making and decorating these into Halloween cookies!!!  I will make these again!!

Just wow! these are seriously the best sugar cookies that I have ever made! Super easy, roll them out and cut them, didn’t chill the dough. Came out soft,  yet firm enough..just perfect cookies! I made larger cutouts so I had to cook for about 15 minutes. Looking forward to making this recipe during Christmas. I was running low on butter and had to substitute 1/3 cup of butter flavored Crisco. They turned out amazing I have zero complaints with my substitute. Will make again following recipe exactly.

Great recipe! I loved how soft and chewy they are. The cookies have the perfect amount of sugar in them. They were super chewy but weren’t too breakable. If I would make these again I’d say to flatten the cookies before baking them because the dough doesn’t flatten itself very much.

Good recipe! I did reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 and I still think I could have reduced it to 1/4 since I use salted butter.

Turns out I’ve been using the wrong sugar cookie my whole life, because these are PERFECT. Typically I browse through the comments for added tips, but not this time. They are literally like the fluffy perfect cookies you pick up at a bakery. I did one batch the size of those tiny little puppy tennis balls, and one batch walnut sized. The only difference was a minute or two in the oven. I started them at 8 minutes and watched them. They’re so good I’m not even frosting them!

They didn't rise they just stayed flat and turned crispy.  The dough was too soft to make it into balls.

Great recipe! perfectly soft and chewy from using the shortening. Definitely keeping this recipe! I did have to alter it, but only because I'm at high altitude: reduced sugar,  increased flour, and baked for 15 minutes instead of 12. Didn't need to add extra liquid like you usually would though,  because I felt the dough was good enough without it.

Delicious cookies!! I made them exactly as the recipe is written, except I added a little green food coloring because I was making them for a St. Patrick’s Day potluck.    They were a little thick, which I liked (I rolled them into balls before dipping them in sugar), but maybe next time I’ll flatten them a touch.

A simple, basic, truly delicious sugar cookie. I use a small (ice cream type) scoop to portion out the dough, partially flatten them with a cup bottom and sprinkle sugar on the top before baking.  They are done when they just start to brown around the edges. If the dough is refrigerated, it needs to warm to room temp. before scooping.

As per other reviews, if you put a ball of dough on your cookie sheet it will bake into a round cookie. I flattened them under a martini glass. My mom said it’s the best tasting sugar cookie I’ve made so far. Better than Pilsbury. I only wish I didn’t have to flatten them.

My seven year old made these with very little help from me. Easy recipe and they turned out delicious. A slight crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside. The dough didn’t even need to be chilled before we rolled it out and used cookie cutters. Great recipe!

I was not happy about the flavor. Dough was too sticky to roll, so I added extra a little extra flour. Thought it still too sticky to roll out but now tasted like flour. Made drop cookies instead. If I make again I will add some sort of extra flavoring, more vanilla or maybe almond or citrus. Texture was soft and good.

I made this with my grandchildren. The dough cracked and was not the correct texture for rolling out for cut out cookies. I might try it again without grandchildren but doubt it.

Perhaps this recipe is better with large cookies, but for sugar cookies made with a cookie press, they are the absolute worst. Hard as a rock. And I halved the cooking time. The only redeeming quality is the cookies held their shape well.

Made the recipe as per directions.  Used a convection oven and my cookies were done at 6min.  Found the recipe very easy.  I rolled the dough and used a cutter.  I did put the dough into the fridge to cool between each rolling.  Found this made the dough easy to work with.

This is a wonderful recipe and the cookies are tasty and wonderful . The recipe is a great starting recipe at the holidays too.  I have added mini chocolate chips. Dried cranberries and sometimes use almond extract versus vanilla and it always produces a cookie that gets compliments. My go to recipe.

These are great cookies, and as promised, nice and soft. I suggest refrigerating the dough for a half hour to an hour so the dough is easier to work with when shaping. I used a cookie scoop and rolled the dough into balls and then pressed flat between my palms. Much easier than slicing and my son was able to help! I then used the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe on here to frost them. With some sprinkles added by my kiddo, these were not only delicious, but a fun activity.

This recipe is wonderful. I added a half cap full of lemon extract to the batter which gave the cookies a nice hint of lemon taste. Cookies came out perfectly shaped and soft. I will definitely be making these again very soon.

YUMMY! I only used butter because I didn't have shortening. Also, i used orange extract and vanilla because that's what I felt like doing. I rolled the balls in raw sugar for a little crunchier coating. They definitely had that nice chewy but soft sugar cookie texture. There are so many options for recipe. Highly recommend everyone to give this recipe a try.

I made these gluten-free by subbing out the flour for Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 flour. I also rolled them out for cookie cutters. They were sturdy, easy to move around, and tasted great!

Nicely flavoured. Soft and easy to cut into shapes. I halved the recipe for a smaller batch and it worked well. I was nervous about that much shortening and butter.

These were wonderful and easy. I didn't change a thing. I doubled the recipe to feed my teenage son's crew team, and they gobbled them up. I did chill the dough for 2 hours to make it easier to form into balls. Baking them for 11 minutes on convection was perfect. Next time I make them I may add some grated orange or lemon zest.

Love these cookies, very simple to make.  It is best to chill the dough for 15-20 min before baking that way it does not spread .  They came out very soft and chewy the way sugar cookies should be.  I’ve made them 2 more time as well.

Classic sugar cookie taste. I used this recipe for my cookie press, and they turned out great! The cookie press made them small and thin, so the edges baked quite crisp, but the centres were still surprisingly soft! Definitely recommend

Made these last night and they were fantastic!  Changes I used where 1) adding 3/4 tsp. lemon extract along with the vanilla and 2)  adding the zest of one lemon to the rolling sugar.  Baked for 12 min. and they were perfect!

These cookies were really good, but I thought they were too sweet. I didn't think they would be because it only had 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar. Next time I'll try 1 cup of sugar. I'll probably cut down the salt just slightly as well.  Other than that, they were delicious.

I am giving  a more recent review simply because all I saw were older ones. I have never liked sugar cookies but  was asked to make some for an event. So with google so at hand I got on here a couple of years ago and found this recipe. It is the only one i use for sugar cookies. My family and friends love them also. Any time there is an event I make this cookies and they are always the first to go!  It s simple  and easily enhanced by flavorings and frostings. My grandkids have all added this recipe tot heir collections and they are not even out of school yet. So I hope that future generations see the delight as we did in making these delicious sugar cookies. Thanks so much!

I loved these cookies! Some of them were a little more brown at the bottom, and they were a bit misshapen, BUT they were absolutely delicious! :D They were soft, but chewy. I sprinkled the sugar on top because they were to brittle to roll in it, and it turned out nicely. (I used organic cane sugar.) They had to be put in for longer in my stove, for 4 minutes longer.(So 14-18 minutes instead of 10-12) Overall, I'd say I'd make these again. They also tasted a bit saltier than usual, but I liked it because it contrasted with how lightly sweet they were. :3

These don’t make good drop cookies as I ended up with 1/2 the batch looking kinda like white cow patties :o)
I smashed the tops of the rest with the bottom of a glass covered with parchment paper so it doesn’t stick to the glass;) sprinkled with colored sugar before baking. Perfect!!! My family thanks you for a great recipe!!!

Everyone said "11 minutes" and they were right. I even cooked them in a convection oven, so I lowered the temp by 25 degrees (to 325). Made the recipe using all butter instead of shortening and the cookies were super soft and delicious. Also makes a great starting point for other cookies. In one batch I added cardamom and toasted sesame seeds - yum! In another I added matcha green tea powder and slivered almonds - yum again! Very versatile recipe.

I made it as is! I used a dog bone shaped cookie cutter and rolled them fairly thin so they only took 8 minutes to bake. Best result was in my convection oven. These were made for his people friends to celebrate my puppy's first birthday!

If you use salted butter use less salt. I used a 1/2 teaspoon and still a little to salty for my taste . Keep that in mind.

If you want to make a scone, this is the best option! I added half all the ingredients as  wanted a smaller batch, and the cookies did not flatten. They were nice tasting, but NOT cookies. Change the name of this to scone.

I love these. My oven is a bit different so I have to bake them at a lower temp, and I add a little less flour, add almond extract, 1Tbs vinegar and Light Cornsyrup.  This makes a nice chemical reaction in the baking process. I tried rolling them out the first time, and the were hard. So I made balls as suggested. They came out so nice this time.

Thank you for sharing this with me.

These were really tasty and so easy to make. My eight year old and two year old had fun adding ingredients to the mixing bowl and especially enjoyed rolling them in sugar! They added frosting and chocolate chips for good measure!

Just made these today to ship to my adopted Grandfather for Easter. We divided the dough at the end and colored each portion: pink, green and blue.  Rolled a little bit of each into each ball for a colored "Easter egg" look. I am not one for adding MORE sugar in the form of frosting. So coloring the dough makes a beautiful presentation. And they are delicious. Perfect sugar cookie recipe. They evoke that classic taste and texture of cookie nostalgia from your childhood.    Next time I plan to use almond flavoring instead of  vanilla for a twist.  *regarding the negative comment on the salt content. I literally used just a dash of salt.

Rolled some in brown sugar per the recipient, some in red/white cookies sprinkles, and the rest in green/red/white long sprinkles with candied fruit in the middle (brid’s Nest version).

I made 1/2 the recipe today and they came out great.  I should have read where this full recipe makes 24 cookies.  My half recipe made 20, I should have made them smaller so that they would have flattened out.  They taste so good!  I think that the next time I make them that I will try and roll them out and use cookie cutters like others have done.  Definitely a keeper!  3/6/2018-Made them again tonight, rolled them out thin, and cut them out with a round cookie cutter.  Came out awesome!  Check out the photo I just uploaded.

Good cookies, I would have said great cookies but too much salt.  I even took a small amount out of the measurement and it was still too much.  Next time I will half the salt.

I made these cookies EXACTLY as the recipe states. I was disappointed that they did not flatten out. If you want flat cookies (like the picture) you need to flatten. I did with my fingers, but will probably do with the bottom of a flat glass.

I used 2/3 cup of butter Crisco and 2/3 cup of unsalted butter, a tablespoon of vanilla and cut the salt in half because of the comments. I also cut the entire ball of dough into three parts and rolled it out. I then used cutters to make the cookies. I guessed at 1/4" for the thickness and some were slightly thinner.   This is the best sugar cookie ever!  I had made pecan pie also and everyone went for the soft yummy cookie.

So far so good, cookies are still cooling.  Even though I halved the salt as suggested by some reviews it was still pronounced.  Next time I’ll only use 1/4 tsp.  I ran out of regular flour so I subbed 2 cups of gluten free flour and I used two sticks butter and 1/3 cup coconut oil since I didn’t have shortening on hand.  Not sure if that’s to blame but the first still warm cookie I tried fell apart, hopefully as they cool they firm up. Otherwise pretty happy with the recipe.  I sprinkled with confetti sugar before baking one batch.  I flattened them a bit before cooking since so many reviews said they did not spread.  Mine did spread.  I put some of the batter in the fridge as the first cooked and cooled.  I’ll see if that makes a difference and update my review if it does.

Nice texture . . . soft sugar cookie.  I shaped into balls and then flattened on a cookie sheet.  Frosted and decorated for Christmas . . . easier than rolling and cutting out shapes.

Very simple recipe and you can make a batch quickly at a moments notice. Very soft and delicious. I used a cookie scoop to get even sized cookies and used a quick frosting made of butter confectioners sugar and milk instead of rolling in sugar prior to baking. Will save the recipe and make again!

These cookies are AMAZING. I have tried so many different cookie recipes and none of them have been anywhere as good as these. They’re soft and delicious! I used butter because it’s what I had, and I baked them only until the centers no longer looked wet. For me, that was about 8-10 minutes. I rolled some of the dough into balls like the recipe said, and I also rolled this dough out and used cookie cutters. Each cookie was perfect! I highly recommend this if you want a chewy, soft, and delicious sugar cookie!!!

I wanted to try out a sugar cookie recipe that I did not have to chill and roll out. I usually add an extra egg to the recipe so I did that and I also added some almond extract. in reading reviews I saw that they tend to maintain their ball-shape, so if you wanted flat cookies you had to press them down with a flat bottom cup, which is what I did. Overall, this is the easiest recipe for sugar cookies I've ever tried. I did try one and it was very good. I still I'm cooking the rest of the batches so I do not know if the cookies will remain as soft as they are Fresh Out the Oven, but right now they are perfect

Amazing sugar cookies!   Easy to mix and after rolling into balls I pressed with the bottom of a fancy cup to imprint a pattern.  Came out perfect!  The only change I made is I melted the shortening first and than let it cool.  I do this with all cookies as it helps make them soft and it mixes in better with the dough.

Nice recipe.  I rolled out and used  for cut outs as I wanted to frost too.  If you roll in a ball they will bake like little snowballs. They do not flatten out to cookies. Whatever your preference.

I followed the recipe as written. I did make sure to cream the butter and sugar until they were very light and fluffy. I did not chill the dough and baked it immediately. I used a tablespoon to measure out the dough and rolled it into balls and then rolled the edges in sprinkles. I used the bottom of a glass to very lightly flatten the dough balls. These cookies did not spread a lot and ended up being very soft and chewy with a slightly crisp edge. Do not overbake,they will set up on the cookie sheet when removed from the oven. Their flavor is subtle but pairs well with a sweet frosting. I would definitely use this recipe again.

I made these as directed- only used beef tallow for the shortening (I probably wouldn't do that again)- they are good texture and taste wise-I just still taste a faint taste of beef tallow, but my husband didn't seem to notice. Will use this recipe again using butter and crisco (instead of butter and tallow).

I went light on the salt but everything else exactly as written. Best sugar cookie ever! Hubby loved them because they are plain. He doesn't like sweet icing and decorations. These can be enhanced any way you want though.  I used a medium scoop and a glass dipped in sugar to flatten. They puffed up a little and made nice sized cookies like you see in a bakery.

Perfect as written. Dough is not very sweet, but since you roll the cookies in sugar before baking, the sweetness factor becomes perfect! We did not refrigerate, and the cookies looked perfect!

I don't know what I did wrong. The dough was really dry. I had to use my hands and really work it to get it to form. Then when they baked they didn't flatten out at all like cookies normally do, they pretty much stayed in the shape I formed them in, more like a ball than a cookie. They taste kind of dry and not real sweet.  What did I do wrong? I guess I'll go back to the old recipe I used to use, this one didn't turn out right for me at all.

I made these and I had used raw sugar and wheat flour. They were WONDERFUL! I love the softness of them. Really great recipe.

Followed the recipe, these are a little drier and not as sweet as I would prefer. Not bad though, it’s a solid recipe that works.

I've been searching for a good soft sugar cookie and I found it!!
The first time I made them I went according to directions and they were delicious, but the second time I decided to roll them out into football shapes.   The dough is very stiff and they turned out great.  As we are avid Denver Bronco fans I frosted them in blue and orange and they were a big hit at the game party.  Now I am looking forward to Christmas cookies in the different shapes

These cookies are gone as  fast as I can make them!  I cut back on the salt and use one stick of butter instead of the 2/3 cup.  I roll the cookies in colored sprinkles depending on the holiday/Season.  I usually have to make a triple batch when I make them!

Very disappointed with this recipe.  The author did not specify that they should be rolled in the size of a walnut in it's husk/hull.   Also, they came out very dry.  I wanted a sugar cookie I didn't have to ice for flavor and moistness.  Initially I didn't understand why they made "24 servings".  What was a "serving"  1 cookie, 2 cookies?  Now I see it is one cookie.  What a waste of time and ingredients.

I made a couple changes, One I added 2 teaspoons on cinniamon and made Cinniamon sugar cookie instead, 2 I did 2 cups of sugar instead of 1 and half cups, and 3 I added halloween sprinkles with the sugar that you use to roll the dough in. Turned out FANTASTIC!

Fantastic! Just like the soft iced cookies at the store. If you want to decorate flat round cookies, just make sure to flatten your balls of dough.

Have made these twice. It's an easy recipe, the cookies make your house smell heavenly, and these are hands down the BEST sugar cookies I've ever tasted. Not too sweet, doesn't crumble as you eat it,  stays fresh at least 3 days, that's how long they lasted before disappearing.  I've done a half recipe and full, the half made 26 cookies, the full produced 60. 
 I iced some so I could try out icing recipes and they hold the icing or frosting very nicely without it adding moisture to the cookie.  Very, very pleased.

My autistic son and I made these as a practical for fractions.  The recipe was very easy and wonderfully yummy!  They did take longer than 10 minutes to cook, but I think we made ours larger than the recipe.  I’m not sure what went wrong though, because, although they were yummy, they were not soft or chewy.  Maybe we overmixed them?  They were a little soft but mostly crumbled.  Still very good for a beginner cook!

i didn't have hard shortening such as "Crisco", so i used safflower oil which is a light oil like sunflower oil. That was my only substitution (other than rolling the cookie dough in colored sugars prior to baking to give them some omph!  for the grandkids.)  That said, the cookies were very fluffy & soft. The colored sugar crystals melted some while baking so the melted sugar encased them in their own packaging keeping them soft until they were  all eaten. Do not  over bake.

Cookies were perfect, quick tip...use a small ice cream scoop (the squeeze and release kind) and drop by the tablespoon on a cookie sheet lined with a non stick sheet. Dip a glass in sugar and gently smashed the cookie until desired thickness was achieved. Perfect, round, delectable, soft, sugar cookies. Happy kids = happy mom!

These turned out great with a few tweaks. I halved the amounts of sugar and salt, and I used all butter (I'm not a huge fan of shortening). The dough made a perfect base for a fruit pizza!

I absolutely love the texture of these cookies! It's definitely the majority of what makes them so delicious! I find these cookies actually aren't sweet enough for me. They lack that prominent sugar cookie-ness in that area. But otherwise, they're great!

Very good cookie. I rolled them out for Easter shapes.  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I might have preferred them with some orange or lemon zest or a little more vanilla but with icing they were just right.

We have made this several times both as roll out cookies and regular cookies. Very easy to work with!  They make soft yummy cookies that have a great texture. This last time we added mini M &Ms and formed into regular cookies. (whatever shape goes in, comes out) they were amazing. Can't stop eating these!! Thank you for a great versatile recipe!!

These cookies are sweet and soft. I ran out of vanilla so I used one tsp of vanilla and one tsp of almond extract. You can refrigerate the dough before baking but since I was only going to roll into balls I didn't but because the dough is so soft; it must be refrigerated at least a day of rolling out. These cookies do not spread whatsoever; therefore, you must press with the bottom of a glass to desired shape. I do believe this resize will work great in a cookie press.

Very good! Felt like the only thing I needed to do was add a little bit more water to make the dough a little more easier to shape. Tasted fantastic, and so simple to make!

As others have said, the texture was perfect. I stirred some red hot candies into the dough before rolling it into balls... It gave my cookies an AWESOME kick!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever found.  Super easy, the dough does not need to be chilled, there's no rolling out and using cookie cutters.  Oh, and did I mention, the cookies come out fabulous, nice and soft!  My husband absolutely loved them and so did I.

I made these cookies according to the recipe, and they were excellent. I baked until they were only barely browned on the bottom, to keep them soft. I don't have much to add to helpful comments from other commenters. I rarely bake, so this recipe must be fairly foolproof. I will absolutely make them again.

2-3-2017  ~For me this was at best an average cookie, sugar cookie or other.  I guess if you like cakey, soft, thick cookies you’d disagree with me but in my view, were it not for the buttercream frosting I covered them with, this would not be the cookie I’d grab seconds for.  Hubs is one of those I mentioned above and disagrees with me, however, he did say it was the “total package;” that he would not have liked these without the frosting.  Note:  I flattened these slightly before popping them into the oven and I’m glad I did – they would have been little poof balls had I not.  Also, I know I would have liked these much better baked longer but then these would be more chewy, even crispy, and not the “soft” cookies these are meant to be.

After reading all the rave reviews, I guess I'm the only person on the planet who didn't like this recipe.... sorry !   One reviewer said she'd used all butter instead of half shortening/half butter.
I don't like to bake with anything but butter so I tried it that way.  Mine turned out VERY hard/crisp, like little hockey pucks.  So then I made it the way called for.....  at least they were softer,
but taste-wise lacked that wonderful buttery taste... more of just a so-so taste.   Third batch I went back to my Mom's old, old
recipe.....soft, wonderful, all-butter...the recipe has never failed me.  However they are roll-out cookies, granted kind of a pain !

I have used my grandmother's cookie recipe for 50 years and have found this recipe to be easier to work with, less time consuming and all together wonderful!  I would suggested using all butter (salted) rather than the shortening and lessen the salt to 1/4 tsp.  You will love these delicious soft cookies - iced or not!

Followed the recipe exactly, but reduced cooking time to 10 minutes.  Soft, delicious, and moist! Rolled them into balls and they were nice and high, not flat at all.   A new favourite recipe!

I was impressed how perfectly these held their shape while baking (I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter)! Mine didn't come out "soft" but were a little crunchy, as you might expect most sugar cookies to be. I also only left them in the oven for 7-8 minutes, as I didn't want them to brown on top (slight browning on the bottom). They also taste really good!

This was fabulous! I added a tsp of almond extract as well. I also refrigerated for 3 hrs and used for roll out cookies. It handled really well and the cookies came out perfectly soft. Keeping this one for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I did chill for about an hour so I could roll out . I sprinkled powdered sugar  on parchment paper  & rolled dough out and they came out perfectly. I only baked for about 9 minutes otherwise they would have been too hard (just  depends on your oven) My only complaint was the cookies were too salty. Next time I will use only a 1/2 tsp.salt or unsalted butter. Topped with homemade buttercream frosting & they were a big hit. Will definitely make these cookies again.

My mother & father who are not fans of sugar cookies absolutely love these!  They are soft & chewy unlike store bought sugar cookies. The recipe is easy to follow and ingredients are always on hand! I have to double the batches, they are just that good!  These are are THE best sugar cookies I've ever had!

Loved this.
Made a few mistakes but still turned out so well and I doubled the recipe which ended up with me running out of tin space to put the cookies in. 
First time working with dough and found it painfully slow. But worth the time.

Loved this recipe! My bottoms didn't get very brown but were still done so be aware. I just went by the time and if I could slide the spatula under easily if that makes sense. Everyone loved them and we even made the snowmen as pictured. Very fun Christmas Eve treat!

Best sugar cookies I've had in a long time. Rolled them in 1 oz. ball and they where a little small for my families liking, but it made 38 cookies. I'm going to try making about 11/2 oz next time

Didn't have shortening, used all butter, but  creamed it extra fluffy and they didn't flatten or get extra browned as I was warned they would. These taste a bit more like shortbread which is actually what my secret expectation for sugar cookies is anyway. Next time will use less salt. My 6 year old made these and they came out great!

A little too flavorless.  I remade these with half again as much vanilla  (3tsp) and used butter flavored shortening.  Also used unsalted butter.  They were delicious the 2nd time around.  Try these amendments - you won't be sad.  Also found the balls did need to be flattened before cooking.  They cook more evenly that way.  These don't spread much at all so don't be afraid to put them pretty close together on the pan.

Easy and delicious!! This is now going to be my sugar cookie recipe! 
I used 1/2 tsp of salt and next time I will add double the amount of vanilla extract to give it a more pronounced flavor.

This was the easiest and best sugar cookie I've ever tasted! The only change I made was instead of 2 tsp of vanilla I added 1 tsp each of vanilla and almond extract.

Great cookie! Be sure to pull them out as soon as you see a little bit of browning on the bottom. They are done before they look done and can easily be over-baked.

It was good. Not fantastic but good. The texture and softness were amazing however. They were just a little bland. I'm going to try almond extract next time and see if that boosts it. All in all, a good easy recipe that is good all around. We rolled it out for cookie cutters and into balls. Thanks for the recipe!

These are great! Softest I've ever had. I cooked them at 350 degrees like the recipe said but mine took about 16 minutes. I'll definitely make these again. I've already made them twice this month :)

I've been searching for a good sugar cookie recipe for a while. The flavour is fantastic. But I didn't roll them out into balls because of other reviewer's suggestions. Instead I rolled out the dough with a rolling pin to be about one quarter of an inch thick. Then I used a round 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter to cut out my cookies. And I dipped the top of the cookies with sugar.  I left the cookies in for 15 minutes.  This produced a crunchy, only slightly chewy cookie which is exactly what I wanted. This method of portioning resulted in approximately twice as many cookies than the recipe indicates.  With these adjustments I will be making these cookies again on a regular basis.

Fantastic cookie recipe. I was hesitant to use it, as I'm a "butter all the way!!!" Type person. I've made other cookies with shortening before, and I thought they were okay. but a butter recipe won my heart in the end. So I approached this recipe with trepidation. But since I had shortenin on hand, I had nothing to lose. I am so glad I gave it a try. I made a full recipe for my son to take to his class, and then my husband took the rest to coworkers. Both the class and coworkers agreed this cookie was a perfect/amazing/wonderful sugar cookie. I now have two sugar cookie recipes in my recipe index. (The other is thinner/crunchier cookie). I suppose I will have to restock on some shortening before the holidays. Nonetheless, let it be stated, butter makes everything better and always will. The half and half is a great way to increase the soft/chewiness and get a butter flavor.  Thus making them such a hit.

This made a nice soft cookie (following the directions of others to reduce the salt).  I chilled it in the fridge for 1 hour so that we could roll and cut out the cookies into shapes, because my kids love using cutters!  I find this recipe makes about 3 cookie sheets' worth of cookies.

I followed the dough recipe exactly as instructed but made a few changes during baking. After I rolled them into balls, I pressed them down into the pan and I'm glad I did. They really don't flatten or grow very much, so they came out exactly the size and shape I wanted, although I did come out with about 36 cookies. I skipped dipping them in sugar because I knew I wanted to frost them, and they're wonderful frosted. They aren't crunchy, but slightly crispy on the bottom and the perfect amount of chewiness throughout the cookie. Will definitely make again!

This ended up as a disaster for me, but it was mostly my fault.  The cookies spread out more than I expected and ran together. They also  weren't baking all the way through because my oven is not really suited to making things that only need to bake for a short amount of time. Some of them ended up burnt. But the actual cookies that came out okay were perfectly soft and delicious. I coated some of them with a lemon glaze. I will make this again, hopefully with more success :(

I have made these a few times for holiday parties and BBQ's.  They are always a big hit and by the end of the party all that's left is crumbs. I love how soft and chewy they are without that undercooked taste you sometimes get with "moist" cookies. I followed the recipe exactly as it is and used a simple sugar cookie frosting I found on here.  I think if I had one small complaint it is that they don't spread out at all.  After rolling them into a ball, I use the bottom of a glass that's buttered and covered in sugar to press them into 1/2" disks.  It's no big deal, just makes for a little more work.

I have been looking for a soft sugar cookie.  This one is really good.  My son even commented on how good they where.  Still love Cheryl's but when the budget is tight this is a great substitute.

I will definitely use this recipe whenever making sugar cookies.  I mixed the sugar topping with cinnamon in order to make snickerdoodles.  I even made a batch with Cup 4 Cup gluten-free flour.  It was difficult to tell that they were gluten-free.

These were the absolute most amazing cookies I've ever made! They were soft yet chewy and I just couldn't stop eating them. Perfect recipe for sugar cookies on the softer side. Just made them without shortening and sugar on the outside and they were still great. Even my brother who doesn't like sweet treats loved them!

Cookies turned out great.  I wanted to decorate them and the first tray didn't flatten out as much  I thought they would so I flattened out the balls for the rest and they turned out perfect.  Very tasty, they were a big hit!

I used butter instead of the shortening, and the cookies came out alright. Though they did taste a tiny bit on the buttery-bland side, I liked them. I may make them again, too.

Just made a batch fresh out the oven 5 minutes ago and they are sooo good! I followed the directions as exactly written with the exception of adding 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract (I love lemon). They would have been great even without me adding the lemon??

I was very pleased with this recipe. I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I used all butter. I also added about 1/2 cup more flour than the recipe called for , which made the dough less sticky for handling and rolling into balls.  These alterations didn't adversely affect either the flavour or the texture. The cookies held their shape beautifully, baked up soft, and tasted delicious.

These are very good.  I used all butter (no shortening).  I would agree they are a bit too salty but that might be because I used salted butter as well.  Next time, I may try almond extract instead of vanilla.  I also used them to roll out and make cut-out cookies.  Baked 10 minutes.

I've tried many sugar cookie recipes over the years and all of them either fell flat (pun intended), were too hard, or were too involved. I made these this morning, I have a batch in the oven as I type this! I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little food coloring since it is St. Patty's Day. I LOVE THEM! This will definitely be my go to sugar cookie recipe!

Finally, I tried so many sugar cookie recipes looking for this soft, chewy kind. These are teriffic: the dough is easy to handle and they couldn't be easier to make. Followed exact recipe, but chilled dough for  an hour before rolling and flattening somw with a glass. Next time I may make them larger because they don't spread much.

It's a great recipe. It's a real sugar cookie but it tasted a little too sugary for some of the cookies. Like some other people, I used butter instead of shortening and it turned great. Awesome recipe!!

I normally follow recipes completely as is.  Due to laziness, snow and my desire not to go to the store when I made these I 1) used butter instead of shortening  2) only used about 1/2 teaspoon salt 3) did not mix by hand but used mixer on low speed and 4) flattened them after they had sugar put on them and before they went into the oven.  It's a preference, if you don't, they will come out more  like half a  circle and thicker in the middle.   They tasted delicious, they are not a chewy cookie, but nor are they "break your teeth crunchy."  They aren't crumbly either.  I look forward to frosting the next batch.  They were a big hit with our office staff.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!  It's a keeper for me!

OMG do not make these while dieting!!! I accidentally ate about 20 of them. Soooo good! I rolled them into small balls and doubled the recipe. It made about a million little cookies, I was rolling for hours. But they were perfect. Topped with a sugar cookie icing recipe from this site too. So perfect!!

I made this recipe almost as written.  The only change I made was to use my cookie scoop to shape the cookies and then dip them in the sugar, instead of rolling them into balls by hand.  This recipe makes soft, fluffy, almost cake like cookies.  My family loved them.

I made this recipe as written, except I used probably only 3/4 t. of salt, which I think was a good thing.  I live at 7,000 ft.  but made no adjustments, using 350 degrees F with a convection/bake setting.  However, I took my dough and made two long log rolls, probably 2" in diameter, and wrapped in plastic wrap.  I think refridgerated them for about 2 hours, taking them out of the fridge 10 min. before slicing.  I made the slices about 1/3-1/2 inch wide with a very sharp knife, and then placed them on the baking sheets.  They weren't quite perfectly round due to the flat bottom, so I used my fingers once they were on the sheet to "round" each on e a bit more.  They baked 10 minutes, until the edges were just slightly brown.  I had absolutely NO problems doing the cookies this way, and it saved me quite a bit of time.  I frosted them with buttercream frosting and sprinkles.   For Valentine's Day, I may try using heart cookie cutters.

I make BIG birthday cookies for all my kids and grands but I don't want to make a big batch of cookie dough because i'll eat what I don't send!   I used butter instead of a mix of shortening and butter 1/2&1/2. Instead of whipping up an egg and using 1/2 of it, I just used a whole egg.  I needed to increase the bake time 2 minutes because I made 3 big cookies instead of 6 normal ones. SO YUMMY! My girls will love them, the 3rd one was for me of course, had to make sure they were good right?!

YUM, YUM, YUM! These are so delicious! I don't even really LIKE sugar cookies, but I just ate three of these straight out of the oven.  I wanted something cute to make for my  Dental Assisting class, so I bought a tooth and toothpaste cookie cutter and they came out super adorable and really held their shape!  I didn't have any problems with them falling apart, and the cookie remains just the perfect crisp to moist ratio. I left them in 10 minutes and it was perfect. Any longer and I think they would have overcooked. Cannot wait to ice these tomorrow and will be making again!

I followed the recipe and am very pleased!  Soft and delicious. I wanted to also make a batch using cookie cutters but it was too soft even after refrigerating the dough for 40 minutes.

It was great. Used butter instead of shortening and it was AMAZING and SUPER easy. P.S use 1/3 teaspoon of salt.

I did what another reviewer said and added some orange zest and made sure to mix the sugar, butter and shortening well. I cut back just a little on the salt and flattened the cookies instead of making them into a ball. These cookies are amazing! I've made these multiple times and they are wonderful with lemon zest too.

I just made this recipe with my little kids. we ran out of white flour and had to use about half whole wheat flour. The cookies still turned out to be some of the best sugar cookies I've ever had. this recipe is really easy too. I'll probably let my son use this recipe when he does his first solo batch of cookies sometime in the near future.

These were very easy and good.  Next time I will decrease the salt a bit.  We refrigerated the dough before rolling into the balls so the cookies didn't spread out too much and stayed soft.

I don't even know what to say! I don't even like sugar cookies and I could not stop eating them. I decided to make them to use up some frosting I had. I thought I'd frost them and decorate with red and green sprinkles for the kids. I did that for a few but then I tasted one after my husband raved about them. Could possible be one of the best cookies I have ever ate. My frosting was no longer deserving. I saved half for myself and took the other house to family who also raves about them. They are definitely on my yearly Christmas cookie list!

These are phenomenal. Like another commenter said, letting the dough sit in the refrigerator for an hour really makes it. My daughter took some dough and pressed it into cookie cutter shapes and those were good as well.

I recently made these cookies and I have to say they are not even close to what I thought they would be. they are very dry and I could have probably had a better out come by just throwing any ingredients in a bowl and mixing them till I though it might work.

4 starts because i agree with other reviewers there is too much salt.  But cutting back the salt makes this a 5 star cookie.  So soft and delectable.

Amazing cookies......cook time was perfect for nice soft chewy cookies. Recipe was simple to follow that I didn't pull my hair out even with my little ones helping. Definitely a new Christmas favorite. Make sure you press them with a fork to your preferred thickness because they do not spread out on their own.

I've shied away from sugar cookies before because they never turn out for me. These are amazing! I did a test sheet with some  dropped, some pressed with fingers and some pressed with a glass on one sheet taking a few out at different intervals of time. I could not tell the difference between the finger pressed and glass pressed as they all raised a bit. I pressed a few of the dropped cookies after baking and they look good too. I had my 19yr old son test the done-ness. He liked the flattened ones I took out at 10 min. best until I gave him the drop cookie that I took out at 12 min. Delicious!

These turned out great.  I only used a little pinch of salt after reading some of the comments and I made some frosting for them. They were soft and fluffy, perfect Christmas cookies!! I had been looking for a recipe that didn't need to be chilled, rolled and cut and this is it!!!

I am a typical asian who doesn't like too sweet food. I have to be honest that I cut 1/3 of the super from the recipe. So it's perfect for my taste. I love it and I will definitely do it again.

This is a fabulous cookie recipe. The only problem I had was when I went back to read other recipes and then came back to this one to actually follow it, the 1.5 C sugar ingredient was gone and replaced with "1\3 C sugar for decoration"  twice. Must be a glitch on the website. However, these cookies were gone so fast that today will make the third time I've made them in a week. I rolled them out for Christmas shapes and iced them using the "sugar cookie icing" recipe from this site. Together these recipes make for the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted!

Have made these for a couple years now. Kids love them. Great soft sugar cookie! I did add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for a little extra spice. Made the mistake of leaving them in the oven for a couple extra minutes because they didn't look "done". While they were still delicious they were just crunchier when they cooled. I learned my lesson and the next pan came out nice and soft.

This is a good recipe.  I love how soft there were.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I would put less salt (maybe half) and a little less flour or more sugar.   I think they needed a little more sweetness and less saltiness.

This recipe made the most perfect texture sugar cookies I've tried.  I baked for 11 minutes and ended up with about 3 dozen cookies.  My only dislike would be that they're saltier than I would've preferred as is. However, I plan on covering them with a sugar cookie frosting so I think the salt could work in my favor. Would make again!

I followed the recipe exactly as written but cookies taste like biscuits and the recipe didn't say they would bake in the ball form. in the second batch I realized they wouldn't spread and needed to be flattened before baking.

Super soft and the kids loved them! I substituted 1/2 c of apple sauce for the eggs (bc I'm allergic) and they came out great! I will definitely make them again.

Make cookies a day ahead- they taste better  also Better with this frosting - this frosting will set a bit but tays on the soft side - just leave space around edge & don't stack cookies. better next day
frosting recipe- you will have left over or make a 1.5 recipe
3 cup powdered sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup milk
1/3 c soft butter
3 TBL sour cream
1 tsp vanilla
milx & put a spoon full on top in middle of cookie- stays pretty wet until next day so leave room on sides & don't stack cookies

you can add lemon zest , lemon juice & or extract- I get the crystalized lemon & add it in to dough & juice & extract to frosting for lemony flavor
peppermint extract to dough & frosting , top with a peppermint Hershey kiss for holiday or pink, red & white andes mints, or white peppermint hershy's kisses chopped , or frosting recpe above add peppermint extract & top with chopped candy cane pieces

These cookies are delicious, if a little on the small side.  They have a wonderful texture, and they're nice and fluffy. These are officially my favorite sugar cookies!

Love these! Had a pregnancy craving tonight and these were exactly what I needed. Even my fiance who said he doesn't like sugar cookies likes these.  I didn't have baking powder so I used baking soda and it didn't seem to be a problem. I also used sea salt that was in large chunks which usually is okay but made some cookies too salty. Totally my fault, still totally great.

Amazing cookies and so easy to make.  Super soft and light.  Very transitional recipe.  I made some rolled in sugar, some cut outs, and another set where I pushed down in the center and added a little raspberry jam.  This is my new favorite recipe!

I have made these multiple times the are soft & chewy. I have replaced the vanilla w/almond extract and feel this gives the cookies more flavor.

A bit much salt but otherwise a great recipe. I use this as a base for most of the cookies I make, occasionally swapping half a cup of the white sugar for brown sugar.

They had to much vanilla in them. That's all I could taste. They may have been alright with icing and I couldn't taste the butter very well. I used real butter. They were easy to make, though. I like that part. Don't know if I will make them again.

This recipe is definitely staying in my favorites!  We like our sugar cookies a little bit bigger, so I added another minute to the cooking time to compensate, and they came out just right!  I didn't find that the salt content was too high, I thought it offset the sweetness just perfectly - it's just a matter of taste, I guess.  Great cookie recipe!

As one of the reviewers said, cream the butter, shortening, and sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy before proceeding to next step. I also sprinkle cinnamon in the mixture. Cool the mixture before rolling into balls.

All other sugar cookie recipes I tried taste too floury or are flat thin things that aren't even worth eating. This recipe solves both those issues and will definitely be my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on!!!

I love store-bought sugar cookies because they are super soft and frosted and wonderful. So I decided to make these so I wouldn't need to buy them.They did NOT come out as expected. The dough wouldn't fan out on the sheet while cooking, it just stayed in a ball so I had to squish them into a cookie shape before baking them. When they came out and cooled, they felt hard as rocks on the outside and kind of looked like snickerdoodles. On the inside, they were not even done (and they had been given extra cooking time). My brother tried them, and gave them a 5/10. The only things in the recipe I changed was I used half as much salt and added a bit of water since the dough wouldn't come together. Maybe this recipe is for more experienced bakers, but I don't think I'll be making them again any time soon.

Just tried these for the first time. Seems like the app had a glitch, the first time I looked at the recipe it only called for 1/3 cup of sugar. Which is what I followed, they still tasted great. I sprinkled with sugar on top and I enjoy the slightly more shortbread flavor. Yum! I will try the original recipe next time.

I used margarine in place of shortening and reduced the salt by half. Really nice cookies. I rolled into balls, and they did spread quite a lot for me. I might have mixed them longer than some bakers. Everyone was very happy.

Very soft and yummy cookies.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of plain. No need to refrigerate.  Flattened balls slightly with sugar-dipped glass.  10 minutes was perfect.  Buttercream icing to top it off.  Yum.

Delicious and easy to make. I agree that 1tsp of salt is too much. Like the other reviewer, I should have trusted my instincts and left out the salt. But my kids don't think they're salty. Oh, and I only used butter, no shortening and replaced 3/4 cup of the regular flour with coconut flour. I find the coconut flour is great for high altitude baking living in Denver. Try it out without the salt.

Too salty, too much flour.  The dough was too flaky to even stick together to roll it out.  After baking, I tried to frost them to cover the taste, but it still overpowered the sweet frosting.  Not a fan of this blue-ribbon recipe.

Incredibly soft and melts in your mouth! Only change I made was I threw in some almond extract along with the vanilla for a more genuine sugar cookie flavor (about 1 t or so) but other than that, followed to a T. My experienced and hard-to-please taste tester (my 3 yr old son) inhaled in and said "Best cookies ever, Mummy!" so there it is. You won't regret making these!

Just finished baking these. I really like the dough, easy to work with and they shape and bake beautifully. My only issue is that IMO they have a slight raw flour taste. I baked one sheet, tasted one and decided they needed something else to combat the raw flour taste; I added cardamom. That did the trick for me! I'm betting these cookies will be better eaten the next day; we will see.

Everyone loves these every time I make them, especially with cream cheese frosting on top. I tried lard to replace the shortening but found that, although still good, it lacked something without the shortening.

I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted coconut oil for the shortening and pineapple juice for the vanilla extract. Had to bake these an additional 5 minutes. They came out a little fluffier than the picture, but still good.  They only lasted about 20 minutes :)

I was reluctant to try this recipe because of the shortening, I've never cooked with shortening but looking at the ingredients made me cringe. However, I tried it due to all the great reviews and I have to say they're the best we've ever made. Its a keeper. I read the review from the person that said it was too much salt and I'm wondering if she used salted butter rather than unsalted because we thought they were perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

More like a soft shortbread cookie than a sugar cookie. The use of shortening gives the dough a nice texture but gives the cookies a metallic taste and they lack depth of flavor. All butter would be much butter. The biggest issue though, is that the dough is not sweet enough! I won't be using this recipie again.

These cookies tasted more like biscuits. They turned out more floury than sugary. They did make a lot of walnut-sized cookies, but they never spread out. I got 4 and 1/2 dozen walnut-sized soft cookies.

This cookie turned out great, nice and chewy and soft, however next time i use this recipe i will cut down on the salt, maybe only 1/2 tsp rather than a full tsp. Too salty for me.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter flavored shortening. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference but the cookies were hard like biscotti. Also they were too salty for my taste but my husband enjoyed that they were buttery,not too sweet and he dipped them in his coffee. They were okay but I don't think I'll make them again.

Very nice recipe although I have a few concerns. First of all, they were a little crumby and easily broke. Though my biggest concern was the taste. Normally when I buy sugar cookies from the store they taste sweet but these cookies had a funny taste. Not a very nice taste for a sugar cookie. I would note to put less shortening in them because that is how they tasted. Even though these cookies had a weird taste and broke easily, I would give this 4 stars.

I made these cookies with my g-grand kids this morning. I only put in 3/4 C sugar and 1/2 salt, only because I do not cook with a lot of sugar and salt. I also used Lactose free margarine.  They are really good. Everyone loved them

I made these as the recipe said and they turned out awesome! Super easy to make and decorate. And they were especially delicious warm out of the oven! NOTE: They do not work with cookie cutters. Too puffy when they bake, so the shape changes.

Great cookies!  I made them a little larger and baked them for 12 minutes.  They were puffy, round and chewy - exactly what I wanted. Easy to make.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully. I found that chilling the dough for an hour before baking seems to give them more structure.

I wanted to make some Valentine's cookies, but was tired of the sugar cookie dough I had been using the last few years because it was very crumbly.  I made this recipe to the direction, except for making them cut-outs, and those cookies turned out AMAZING!!!  I could not stop eating them.  I used a Cotton Candy Betty Crocker container of icing on them.  It was absolute perfection....it got me wanting to make cookies for every blessed holiday.  We can use Christmas trees for arbor day, right?

I substituted the shortening with coconut oil.. I used just under the called for measurement..and added just a little bit more butter. I also used a splash of almond milk just because when it was done it was a little bit too dry. They turned out great!! I also added green sugar crystals to the dough before I added the flour (for St. Paddy's Day) and rolled them in sugar and green crystals, stuck a Hershey's Kiss in the center and baked them for 10 minutes.

The cookie tasted okay. But I could definitely taste the shortening. Next time I might omit the shortening and just use all butter. I can't get over the shortening bc it's all I taste. I was hoping for better results, but they weren't that satisfying. And they aren't soft at all when they're cooled. Maybe I just did something wrong? Although I call myself following the recipe, only thing I did was at an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, as I like them very sugary. But even with that, I could still very much taste the shortening. =\

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T. The cookies were not soft, lacked flavor, and stayed like the way you put them on the cookie sheet.  I will not make these again!

I've been using this site for over a year and this is the first time I have bothered reviewing a recipe. This was extremely easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Anyone who gave this recipe a bad review did something wrong or just doesn't like sugar cookies. Today I'm on the hunt for a frosting recipe for these! Delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. They were soft, but the reviews that talk about to much salt were right. That seems to be the dominant flavor.

Made these as cut out cookies and they maintained their shape and taste wonderful - even with out frosting!   Will make these again.   I did use all butter, otherwise I followed the recipe.

Tried this recipe and it was very tasty! The texture was great; no cakey flavorless cookie here! The exterior has a sugary crunch, the interior was soft.

OMGoodness!  I made this recipe because my hubby doesn't like hard cookies so I wanted to find a good alternative sugar cookie recipe.  Now I think I'll have to get someone to lock them away from me as I think I could devour them all in a single sitting!  I can understand why they are blue ribbon winners.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I chose this recipe last night since I needed 5 dozen cookies for my son's school this morning. They requested soft sugar cookies so this is the recipe I chose. I followed this recipe to a T but my cookies never flattened out!
I had to flatten them with a spatula once they were in the oven for a few minutes and they still were not a *soft* cookie. They were hard on the outside and semisoft on the inside :(
The taste was great, so on that note I tried the recipe again stayed up late and finished them but again, I had to flatten them myself.
Any advice/opinions/suggestions would be appreciated as I would love to be able to make a soft sugar cookie ;)

Good recipe not too sweet.  Easy to make and were gone quickly. For those who like sweeter you can add another 1/2 c sugar.  Like others I did add another teaspoon of vanilla.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The cookies came out perfect. Soft and chewy perfection with a little crunch along the bottom. I started my cookies out in the oven for eight minutes then progressively went lower until I got to six minutes in my oven at 350 degrees. All in all this was a wonderful recipe that I will defiantly be using again and again.

I for years I have been looking for a "cake-like" cookie to make chocolate chip cookies.  My husband grew up with a store brand cookie like that and has been after me to make one.  Now I can!  The chocolate chip and walnuts with this recipe did the trick.  Thank you.

These cookies are very delicious!I rolled them in red, silver, and green sugar crystals and they were beautiful. Great for Christmas cookies! I put only a pinch of salt, because a whole teaspoon seemed like way too much.

I love these cookies! They were so beautiful and tasted just right! I made two batches, the first exactly as written and they were perfect, the second batch I changed the extract to 1 tsp vanilla and one tsp lemon extract, they rocked! I like a little lemon to lighten them up a little bit more. These are my go to recipe!

Like other posts, I think it was lacking in flavor slightly, but orange or lemon zest would be great. Also, toward the end of rolling it out it became very crumbly and was hard to work with. It may have been I handled it too much with my 4 year old helping me, but it was frustrating.

I loved these cookies! They are great if you want to roll them out and use cookie cutter also. They were very popular and delicious! I wonder if I could substitute Coconut Oil for the shortening?

I really liked these. It tasted like roll out cookies without the frosting and a bit sweeter, the salt is noticeable, like a salted caramel kind of. So every now and then you bite into a grain of salt when you're eating the cookie. My daughter said it was the best sugar cookie she has ever had.

I have used endless sugar cookie recipes, but this is the absolute best!  I did decrease the salt to 1/2 teaspoon only because I do not like a salty flavor in my sugar cookies.  It was perfection!

I make this recipe all the time. It's a tasty, quick recipe that everyone enjoys. It's great for frosting or just rolling sugar. If you chill the dough you can also use it for your cut out Christmas cookies.

This is a good recipe, I find that I like making them thinner as they are crispier but are soft on the inside. Also good without icing to eat with tea or coffee.

This is my go to recipe!  These cookies are so soft and delicious. Every time I make them I have to make a large batch because they don't may kind around this house.  They make great holiday and any day cookies.

me, my husband and our grandson did a joint effort in making these today. I was looking for a simple and easy recipe to make with the grandson who is 4, and this is it. the simplest and easiest sugar cookie recipe ive ever used. reviewers are correct in that if you put little balls on the bake sheet that is what you pull out of the oven. next time I will make them bigger then walnuts as they came out the size of walnuts. I did have to add time as 10-12 minutes left them doughy.

An easy sugar cookie that certainly lives up to its name. I used my heaping tablespoon scoop which made 26 cookies. I baked each pan of 12 for 14-15 minutes.

I made these cookies for a party and they were a hit. I've had at least a half a dozen people come up to me and ask for the recipe. My oven completely shut off and broke, making me use our toaster oven. I found that when put into the toaster oven the cookies rise more and seem to be more dense. If that is the way you like your cookies, then I would actually put them into the toaster oven at 350 degrees for a couple minutes over the time mentioned in the recipe. Make sure to shift the cookies once in a while.

Great soft sugar cookie.  I did find them just a tad salty so I will cut the salt down the next time I make them but otherwise they turn out perfectly.

I love this recipe because it is easy to make, and I did not have to chill the dough, because it rolled out nicely. After it cooled I frosted it with a delicious butter-cream frosting for Easter (even-though I don't even celebrate it) and it was still soft, so soft my dad said it was to soft even after 2 hours in the fridge. :D

I agree with the other reviews that say these cookies have way too much salt. They tasted like salt cookies, not sugar cookies. The flavor was horrible! I followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out of the oven like little balls instead of flat and soft cookies. I'm known at the office to bring in amazing cookies for everyone to share, so I thought I'd try this one. No one would eat them. Guess I'm still looking for a great sugar cookie recipe to redeem myself.

Substituted coconut oil for shortening which gives it a nice, light coconut flavor when they bake up. Great recipe!  I've gotten nothing but rave reviews. They disappear quickly. ;)

I love sugar cookies, but I don't love having to roll out the dough, chill, etc. so this drop cookie recipe was great. I used Mexican vanilla, and that gave them a really nice flavor. I sprinkled them with red and pink sugar for Valentine's Day and the two colors together made them really pretty. I prefer to flatten the balls with a glass and then sprinkle the sugar on; if you don't flatten them they come out very dome shaped and a little irregular looking, but they still taste great. We'll definitely make these again. Ours were done right at 11 minutes. Next time I might try subbing almond extract for the vanilla; I think we would love that too. The soft texture of these cookies is what makes them so good!

Delicious and easy. I added some orange zest just because I was eating an orange while making the cookies; that turned out to be a fun and tasty twist on the recipe.

I always try a new soft sugar cookie recipe every Christmas. I guess because I haven't found the perfect one yet. Well, I think that I just did! We loved these cookies! They were soft and delicious! My neighbors loved them too. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is by FAR the BEST cookie recipe. I didnt change a single thing. Everyone raves about them. And so easy to make! Recipe makes alot too so I always store them in in a plastic container with a slice of bread. It keeps them nice and soft.

I usually agree with the reviewers on this site, but I'm afraid I was disappointed in these.... They weren't super flavorful, which is fine since it's a sugar cookie.  I even added a bit of almond extract but still not much flavor.  But it was the texture that Ididn't care for.  Sort of a floury consistency- not chewy.  As soon as I can figure out where I packed my normal sugar cookie recipe, I'm going back :-)

I had to make 4 dozen cookies with about one minute notice, and this recipe could not have made it any easier!  I followed it exactly, it was easy to mix, and as the cookies do not spread, but rise up, I could fit more on my baking sheet.  I had them done so quickly, and they taste wonderful.  A little crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  Flattened them with a cup dipped in sugar, but next time will frost some too.  These are so good!

This being my first attempt at sugar cookies, which admittedly are the last I reach for in anyone else's house, I did not have high hopes.  I liked the idea of soft cookies and read the first 10 pages of reviews.  Here are the changes I made:  Added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white, no salt.  I was making them a full day ahead of time so I didn't even wait for them to get brown on the bottoms before I took them out.  About 8 to 10 min per batch.  I was using a snowflake cookie cutter and quickly learned to keep the dough for those very thick - 1/2 inch - and have lots of flour on my working surface.  I made fork impressions and sprinkled colored sugar on them.  It was a nice alternative to the other gooey/rich desserts I made for Christmas.  And also very good to have with tea, even 2 days post-baking, they are still soft and yummy.

Wow, these are fabulous! I was simply looking for a plain old sugar cookie that didn't have to be rolled out and cut into shapes.  I do have a favorite recipe that starts with balls or dough rolled in sugar, but that recipe yields a very flaky delicate cookie and this time I wanted something a bit more durable.  Not only was the texture perfect, the flavor is awesome!  Followed the recipe exactly, using my homemade vanilla extract, and couldn't be happier with the results!

I just finished making these, and let me tell you they're great.  I followed the recipe exactly like it says.  I've been trying to make soft sugar cookies for the last 35 years and have had no luck - they always turned out like hockey pucks.  So I quit trying 7 years ago - until today.  They turned out perfect, just like I remember homemade sugar cookies tasting.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I have to say that these cookies were a huge hit. I used crisco butter flavored shortening sticks, not sure if that changed anything. I know the kid had fun making them into balls and rolling them in the sugar sprinkle mixture. but, i will say that i think the kids might've added some salt to the mixture and it tastes great. We put frosting and mini M&M's on them. They are crunchy and chewy. So good!

These cookies came out absolutely fluffy. I used a cookie scoop which made them the perfect size. For the first batch I left them in the rounded shape and it made them SO soft; they were like miniature pillows! For the second batch I used the "peanutbutter cookie fork smoosh" method, but didn't make them too flat. These were the cookies I frosted. They were equally as soft, so it's really personal preference.

For an added touch, on the rounded ones I put a dab of frosting and a single peanutbutter chip. It was mostly a decorative addition. For the flatter ones I frosted them with frosting I'd colored, and sprinkled miniature Tollhouse chocolate chips on it. Since they were semi-sweet it cut down on the sweetness a tiny bit and gave them a little bit of an edge.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention... I added a dash of cinnamon to the recipe and it really gave it just the perfect hint of flavor. :)

It was a good and easy sugar cookie.  Maybe not my most favorite, but, still good. Dont over bake these or they will be crisp.  Even when it still looks like they are not done take them out! I would skip putting colored sugar on these because it tastes artificial.  Frost instead.

These cookies were so simple to make! I did however replace the shortening with butter, only because i didnt have shortening on hand. I baked these with my daughter one sunday and she had so much fun dipping the tops in sugar. They came out tasty and looked festive as well! I will be making some more today probably 2 batches!

eh..I got this recipe from another site that adapted it with browned butter.  The cookies didn't flatten at all and dough was very crumbly.  I used exact ingredients and followed the directions to a T but ended up having to cook them longer and flatten them in order for them not to taste like raw heated dough  Sorry, wouldn't make again.

I really love this recipe. The cookies are so YUMMMMMMMY! I was looking for the perfect cookie to make "Santa". My daughter insists that Santa deserves only the best cookie. And I found 'em I just tried them out tonite to make sure they would be good and there everything plus that. I made mine rather big though, I think. I also added a different color sprinkles for the time of year. Once again awesome cookies and I definately will use this recipe again! Thank you to whoever posted this!

I made some changes to the origninal recipe, and they are hands down the best cookies Ive ever eaten.

Instead of 2/3 shortening and 2/3 butter, I made it 1 1/3 cup of butter.

I also changed the 2tsp of vanilla to 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp of almond extract which gives the cookies a wonderful taste! 

Also, because I used salted butter, I only put a pinch of actual salt into the dough.

I found that they only needed to be baked for 9 minuets and they stay soft and chewy! 

Everyone in my family loves them, even the ones who don't even like sugar cookies! 

Ive made them a few times now and will for sure, keep making them!

Simple, so that's good. To get them soft, you really have to take them out quickly. I waited until a little brown edge and they are crunchy. Not much flavor, so maybe an orange extract would be good. Probably won't keep this recipe. Even my son said "They're good. No flavor. But they're good." So be sure to use toppings or frost them.

I'm not much of a fan of sugar cookies because they are too time consuming, too hard and often dry.  These cookies are soft and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except used half the salt because my butter was salted.  I used a small dough scooper so all the cookies would be the same size.  I then rolled them, dipped one side in colored sugar, and flattened them slightly on the pan with a glass.  I baked them for 11 min. and they were hardly brown at all.  I was worried that they might not be done, but trusted my judgement and they were.  Do not go by color to determine if they are done.  The recipe made exactly 4 dozen with my scooper.  There is a lot of butter/shortening in this recipe and that can be tasted in the end result as others have said.  I may try to up the sugar a tad next time.  If you frost these, then don't worry.  The frosting will add the extra sweetness.  These will still remain my go to recipe when I need a sugar cookie fast.

I really liked this recipe. Although I was disappointed in it. Because mine weren't easy and they came out looking like rocks but they still were great!

I just LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times and decorated the cookies for a baby shower, a wedding shower and a house warming. I recommend rolling them out to about 3/8" thickness and using cookie cutters. The possibilities are endless. They taste just as good, if not better, than the fancy, decorated ones from the bakery or cookie bouquet store. Just PERFECT! Thank you, Laura!

This recipe tastes just like the store bought iced sugar cookies.  We are living overseas and don't have access to them from a store so I loved these.  I just put on a butter frosting.

Great recipe!  i skipped the decorated sugar and put frosting on top instead.  The cookies really melt in your mouth.  I'll be making them again.

This is by and far the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever made. My mom and I have probably tried a different sugar cookie recipe every holiday season and now my search is over. I used it for rolled out pumpkins for halloween and will be making turkey cutouts with this recipe tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I took them out of the oven before they started to brown and let them firm up on the pan before I transfered them to a cooling rack. My husband raved about them, we think they taste like the sugar cookies in the bakery section at the store. SOOO good, amazing texture and perfect for icing and decorating.

Great recipe I loved it. I made it with butter instead of shortining and I used gluten free all pourpose flour and they still turned out great.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was ok, not too sweet - most of the sweetness is the sugar on the outside. They are perfect with coffee, yum, but by themselves a little dry and maybe a bit crumbly. The one thing I noticed afterwards was that my shortening was a little past the experation date.  I don't know if that makes a difference.  Overall, just ok.

This is a good sugar cookie. I followed the recipe exactly except I flattened the cookie dough balls a little with the bottom of a jar. Good that I did as they did not spread at all. That is actually a good thing as you can see what size cookie you will end up with and can put them closer together on the cookie sheet and save space. 
They tasted good and would stand up to icing too if you wanted to ice them.

Two thumbs up from all my family members.  I made the recipe exactly as written and I'm glad I did.  The cookies came out soft and moist.  My husband and son couldn't keep their hands off the cookie plate.  This is my new favorite cookie recipe.  I'm going to try the icing recipe on top of them next time instead of sugar.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These were ok.  There WERE very soft and the sugar coating gave a crunch.  I was looking for more of a soft and CHEWY cookie, though.  When rolling these into balls and leaving them in balls when baking, the cookies didn't spread in the oven as much as I'd like.  Easy solution is to just flatten it down a bit with your fingers or palm.  Simple sugar cookie.  Good but not the best I've tried.

Very easy and very good!  I pressed them part way down with the palm of my hand and they turned out perfect!   My husband loves them with just the sugar on top, but I prefer a light powdered sugar glaze on top of mine.  We are taken back to our childhood days with these cookies.  His grandma didn't ice hers, and mine did!   They are perfect either way!  Followed the recipe to a T!

It was okay...not the best cookie ever. Sad to say, Betty Crocker's from the package taste better. They were not really "soft"..it had a crunch to it..only the middle was somewhat soft.

YUM! My whole family loved it. We didn't measure out the salt, just put a dash in, but that's only because I rarely cook with salt. We live at altitude and I didn't adjust anything in the recipe. Cookies were so easy to make, came out wonderfully soft, and were gone in no time! Thanks!!

I made this recipe Saturday night. The best sugar cookies I've ever made. My family didn't leave a crumb. I deviated a little and added 1/4tsp of almond extract to the recipe. I love how simple and easy it is from start to finish. A big hit.

This is such a versatile recipe! I've made regular sugar cookies with it and they were awesome, then I tweaked it with ginger, cardamon, cinnamon and orange extract for something a little different, and replaced some of the flour with cocoa powder for decadent chocolate sugar cookies. All turned out great! The original recipe cookies are best when you take them out of the oven when the very edges are just barely staring to brown. They should still look very white on top. I like to decorate them by dipping them or piping on melted Candy Melts. It seems to hold up better than frosting and tastes SO YUMMY!

If you use butter Crisco shortening, make sure you don't add the salt.  Gag! I didn't think about the salt content in the Crisco...  Even without Crisco the 1 tsp still seems like a lot of salt.  That aside it is an ok sugar cookie recipe if you like a soft fluffy inside.  My 4 star rating is based on the overall recipe without the salt oops on my end.  They don't flatten out like you would think so I'd flatten them ahead of time if you don't care for puffy cookies.

Excellent flavor. Do not over mix. I mixed the butter and shortening till it was light and fluffy and They came out soft but very crumbly. I have to say these cookies taste even better the next day. I will definitely make these again. I used 1cup white sugar and 1/2cup of brown.

I made these as vegan cookies. I used egg replacer and added 1/4 of powdered sugar. They were pretty good and my non-vegan partner said they were good. My sons ate them up!!!

Simple and delicious!  I made some into Snickerdoodles by rolling them in cinnamon and sugar.  I LOVE chewy cookies, and these are the perfect texture.  The butter mixture looked kinda weird and curdled after I added the vanilla extract, but it didn't seem to affect the chemistry or the flavor.  Also, I had never baked cookies by just putting golf-ball-sized spheres on the pan rather than shaping them in some way, but it works perfectly!  They turned into perfect, golden, cookie-shaped rounds which practically hovered above the parchment paper.  (I didn't believe you could really put them on an unprepared pan, but I was wrong, it seems.)  I did have to cook them a lot longer (maybe 24 minutes or so!) but I think that's 'cause I'd just made custard in a water bath, so there was a LOT of moisture in the oven.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe - it's great!!

Amazing! I made these for my dad today and wrote "HAPPY FATHER'S DAY" in blue icing across 15 cookies... my dad (who has heart disease) loved it so much and could actually enjoy it without having to worry about feeling pain later. 
I cut down the sugar by just a little (1 1/3 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups), and because I didn't have any shortening I used canola oil... still amazing. The dough takes about five minutes to make, the cookies about 15 to bake each batch and I had everything baked and my kitchen cleaned within a half hour. Amazing amazing amazing, will do again.

just made the batter for these cookies... super easy! i made a few changes to the recipe, though. I used 1 1/3 cups of margarine and omitted the shortening and salt. I discovered I was out of vanilla extract, so I substituted lemon extract. The batter is chilling in the fridge, and I'll be putting them in the oven in a few minutes! I just ran to the computer to tell you what I think so far. *fingers crossed*

Great basic sugar cookie recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly and I found them to be just a little more crumbly than I was expecting.  Overall, they were very soft and tender and I will certainly make them again

I have done a lot of research looking for a perfect soft sugar cookie.  This one is the best.  I am making these cookies for an anniversary party in a flower shape and did a test run this weekend.  They are delicious!!!

I have made these cookies about 2 times now and have enjoyed them both times. I can't wait to do it again. I do add about 2 more teaspoon of vanilla, and about 1/4 cup cup.

These are SO good, chewy and buttery!  The only variation to the recipe I made was I omitted rolling the cookies in sugar.  I prefer my cookies not too sweet, and they were just sweet enough for me.  I pressed the cookie down with a fork and sprinkled some colored sugar (before baking) for presentation, and was fantastic!  I highly recommend these!

This recipes is probably normally very good, but I must have added too much shortening, even though I tought I followed the directions. The cookies had a very distint taste of shortening. Also, I live at 7000ft, and these cookies did not drop hardly at all. They stayed as round little balls.

I was out of solid shortening so I used margarine in place of the shortening. BIG MISTAKE!!! My dough was too soft and the cookies turned out flat. Now I know better.  I will try the recipe again with exact ingredients listed and see how it turns out!!

These cookies were wonderful and easy to make. I didn't even roll them out. I used a cookie scoop and they turned out round that way. After they cooked, I decorated them with frosting. They can be eaten either way; frosted or not.   Thanks for the new additon to my recipes!

I tried to make these cookies twice and they were too crumbly. I tried the second time because I thought maybe I messed something up the first. Very disappointing. The flavor was ok...I added some Almond Extract. But the texture was off.

These sugar cookies are the best I've ever made. I think they are way better than "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe. These are soft and chewy where as the others were hard and crunchy. I didn't try to roll them out and make cutout cookies though. That might change the texture. However, as drop cookies as written....they are fabulous!!! I topped them off with the Buttercream Icing by Sharon Gerstman from this website. That frosting is amazing!

AMAZING. Texture is the best I've had, and I've tried my fair share of cookies--sugar and otherwise. I did roll out half of my dough, and after my first sheet, pressed the tops lightly with the bottom of a glass to make them a bit wider/flatter so I can frost them but it didn't alter the taste of the cookie! I will try rolling, just for options' sake :-)  GREAT recipe to be able to play with presentation!

This was one of the easiest sugar cookies I have ever made. We rolled it out and used flower cut outs. The cookies stayed soft for at least 4 days (they didn't last any longer even though I made a double batch.) Every one said they were like the "pink frosted cookies" that you can buy at the store but tasted much better. I followed the recipe exactly except changing the servings, which this recipe does easily. In fact my mother called me this morning asking which recipe I had used because she was wanting to make star sugar cookies for the 4th of July. I may have to make some flags to go with them.

Great cookies!  I dressed up a batch for Canada Day and they were fab!  Everyone gobbled them up - even those that were 'dieting' couldn't resist!

These cookies were really easy to make. My 4 year old loved helping roll them in to balls. They are very soft and chewy and they taste good. I wouldn't say the flavor is great, but they are good. I can really taste the shortening and I was hoping for a sweeter taste. I am gong to try them again with a few adjustments to get them sweeter.

This recipes is great! I did alter it a bit because I didn't have shortening, so I used butter/margarine. The only thing that needs to be changed is the time; it took me 15 mins. Delicious!

What a disappointment..my go to recipe is a different soft sugar recipe, but I thought I should try this one out. Big mistake! These were not very fluffy, did not puff up at all, the taste was blah, the texture was passable but not great and they just looked bad. Other recipes can be cooled and rolled out (depite being drop cookies), but these just can't; and I tried every trick I know! I have worked in bakeries for years now and can tell you with certainty that this is not the best soft sugar recipe out there.

These cookies are awesome!  The only problem is that they disappear at my house.  They are my kids favorite and now whenever I start to make cookies their first question is "are you making sugar cookies?"

These cookies are great! I found myself grabbing these right off of the pan! I had to bake them for a little bit longer than the stated time, but that was the only flaw. These have been cooling for about 5 minutes now, and I'm sure they'll be even better when they are fully cooled!

These were really good and fast to make! I had to make some substitutions because I was out of some things. I used all canola margarine for the butter and shortening, I used half white sugar and half icing sugar, out of vanilla so I used 1 pouch vanilla sugar and rolled the balls in white/clear coarse sugar.Used my tbsp scoop and got 55 cookies, 12 minutes on silpat lined baking sheets was perfect for my oven. Next time I will try my 1/2 tbsp scoop and coloured sugar like the picture.
1/2 tbsp scoop bakes in 7 minutes.
Using my #50 scoop it made 24 large cookies that I rolled in coarse sugar and baked for 18 minutes, I like to use all butter now and omitted the salt, since it was salted.

The recipe made quite a few generous sized cookies (lost track because so many disappeared so quickly).  Not a light tasting sugar cookie, but goes really well with a glass of milk.  I used regular sprinkles on top, thought they looked so tasty!  WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I thought they turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly and no complaints.  I rolled them into walnut-sized balls and my girls rolled them in colored sugars for decoration.  They turned out small, which worked out great for us because they were for a Mother's Day Tea.  So the size was perfect for what we needed  Tasted great, just sweet enough.  But, the added sugar sprinkles were the right sweetness for my kids.  We even left a few out overnight by mistake and they were still soft in the morning.

this is the best sugar cookie recipe i have come across. They are super easy to make and come out soft and delicious every time. Sometimes they get cinnamon sugar topping sometimes sugar sprinkles, sometimes icing. They are a hit always.

I've made these a few times. I try to do things lactose free so I usually use all margarine this, time I used 1/3 cup canola oil. I don't have the proper kitchen utensils so I can't exactly measure things other then flour so I have no idea how much baking powder I'm putting in but they came out super fluffy. I love these cookies!!!

I tried this recipe on a whim, seeing it while looking for a totally different cookie recipe and I'm glad I tried it.  My kids loved these and my daughter took a few to her teen friends at school who said I should be a professional baker.  They do get hard after a few days being stored but a piece of bread added to the container quickly softens them within several hours or overnight.

Super-easy to make and delicious! Could barely keep the cookie monsters away from them long enough to cool them. This will be added to my list of cookie "staples".

These are the easiest and best sugar cookies I have ever made.  I usually make a double recipe and freeze 1/2 of the cookies for later.  These roll out easier than most cookies because of all the flour.

BEST SUGAR COOKIES - period!  Unless of course you like dry, crumbly and tasteless sugar cookies, in which case these are not for you ;)

These cookies are awesome! I've made them a few times now, each time i get rave reviews. I put frosting and sprinkles on mine, for some added sweetness.

Easy to make, but mine were not super soft. Maybe I cooked them too long, even though they were barely brown on the edges.

Substituted margarine for the butter since I was out.  Turned out perfect!  Soft, a little crispy at the edges, and not too sweet.  Will make with butter next time, since there is really no substitute for butter.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar,1 extra tsp of vanilla and approx 1/4 cup of sour cream to this recipe and it was great ! I had to sprinkle in a little extra flour at the end but it was not a big deal, I also chilled it in the fridge for about 1 hr, that firmed the dough up well enough so it wasn't sticky ! I would definitely recommend this  recipe !

Absolutely delicious and i am not a sugar cookie fan. I did add some orange zest as another reviewer suggested and it has a very light orange taste. The orange zest just gives it a depth of flavor. We just rolled them and then dipped them in colored sugar and flattened just a bit and they came out perfect. Kids and adults love them.

Today was my first time making these cookies to roll out for valentine day cookie cutters.  I think i rolled to thin the ones that were approx 1/4 inch thick stayed soft. so that i will make sure to keep on the thicker side next time.  Also I cooked until bottom gold brown- they were soft when they came out of the oven but became hard within fifteen minutes so next time I'll plan to take them out even if i think it's too early.  overall though pretty good easy to roll out and they kept there shape and are smooth on top so should frost well with royal icing.  We'll see how it goes with my changes next time.

I was looking for a soft sugar cookie for my little brother, and he loved these! They are very soft. I doubled the vanilla on the recipe because I think that in general it gives the cookie a better flavor. It also makes a difference what kind of vanilla you use. My father travels to Mexico a lot and he brought back Xilkan Vanilla. It has such a superior flavor! I have made other sugar cookies before, but these are his favorite, AND they are super easy to make!

WOW! These cookies were amazing! They're soft and delicious and actually stay that way unlike other cookies that are soft for about 20 minutes right out of the oven. All of my friends adore them and they all beg for more.

These cookies were absolutely fabulous!  I actually used 1 full cup of shortening and 1/3 cup of butter (that's all I had in the house) and only 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla (I ran out) and they still came out great!  I can't wait to make them the proper way!

I just finished baking my last batch of these cookies and they are DELICIOUS! I only wish I would have tripled the recipe since I know they probably won't last through tomorrow morning with my 4 kids and hubby. I rolled half of them with the cinnamon & sugar mix and they tasted even better. I definitely will be making this again (maybe even tomorrow) so that I can share it with people at work. AND I will be making 3 or 4x more than I did today.

DELICIOUS! These cookies turned out very soft, and taste great! I had to add a little flour and more sugar because my dough was very wet still. I couldnt roll the dough so I simply spooned it. Great recipe, def adding this one to favs!! Thanks!

Love these cookies! I was looking for something similar to the lofthouse sugar cookies you get at the grocery store. These were pretty darn close if not better. SUPER soft and yummy. I only had margarine so I used 1 and 1/3 cup of margarine instead of the butter and shortening. I also beat the egg butter sugar vanilla mixture for a little while until fluffy. We frosted them and they were delish!

This is the best tasting recipe for cookies I have ever made.  Made them for Christmas and my twins kept eating them until I had to tell them to stop.  I actually had to hide the cookies so the kids wouldn't eat them up.

tried to use this recipe to roll out and cut cookies with the kids.  NIGHTMARE!  I tried three times but the dough is too soft.  Even put it in the fridge and cut out on was paper.  This was not the happy little make Santa cookies experience I was looking for.  Finally finished the cookies at 9:30 pm.  They do seem good for round cookies, just don't torture yourself by trying to cut them with cutters

I added a 1/4 tsp each of orange and lemon peel and substituted butter for the shortening. These are the perfect cookie to make with young kids. I rolled each piece of cookie dough into a ball and then gave them to my sons to dip into small bowls of sugar and sprinkles. My older son loved being the one who got to mash the balls of dough down with a juice glass before they went in the oven. They had a blast and it was so easy (no rolling out of the dough) that I was able to enjoy it. No stress! Easy clean up. Took 11 minutes at 350, and they were soft and yummy. My husband says these are like the ones his grandmother used to make.

Great cookies!  Good take on the classic sugar cookie, and even better because they were soft.

I liked this one for a cookie similar to lofthouse and very soft- I again added 1 tsp Almond Extract and only baked mine for 8 minutes- let them sit on the pan for 1-2 minutes and then cooled them on a rack.  I also liked the thicker cookies the best and a few I rolled at the end into balls to use up the leftover dough and they were amazing

This is the first time I've made cookies from scratch.  They came out delicious.  My husband thought they weren't sweet enough so we added 1/4 cup of sugar the 2nd time around.  Either way they were delicious.  I just had one out of the tupperware & it was still soft after a week.  We used cookie cutters & we had to refrigerate the dough for a little while, maybe 45 minutes, and were able to roll it out & cut shapes.  We iced them using the sugar cookie icing recipe.  They were a hit.

Perfect!  I used the bottom of a small glass to flatten them slightly after rolling them in sugar and laying them on the cookie sheet.  Will keep this recipe for years to come.

these are great cookies! I made the dough yesterday and let it chill in the fridge overnight.  It was easy to roll out and shape and baked perfect at 350 for 10 minutes. Will definitely make these again.

I am not a sugar cookie fan mostly because I prefer a soft chewy cookie...but I had all the ingredients and needed SOMETHING sweet :-) These were awesome...for a sugar cookie lol. I can understand how, for some, it may be a bit salty, but I didn't mind so much, although I will probably use less next time. Good cookie!

This is a great recipe for those times when you want a sugar cookie that doesn't require rolling out and cutting. I had to bake mine a little longer than the time stated in the recipe. The cookies are slightly rounded, crunchy and sugary on the outside and soft on the inside. Simple and delicious.

Exactly what I was looking for! I ended up having to make a dessert for a party on short notice, and these were PERFECT! I did decrease salt to 1/2 tsp, and I sifted the flour, salt, and baking powder before adding to creamed ingredients.  In general, use high quality vanilla and real, unsalted butter, and make sure nothing is expired, and your baked goods will turn out better.  If you don't have an essential ingredient (i.e., EGGS!) then DON'T TRY THE RECIPE!  Also, I wonder if the people who gave the bad reviews really understood what "creaming" means.  You need to do it until everything is creamy white and fluffy, or the cookies won't turn out.  I rolled them into larger balls and flattened slightly when dipping them into the colored sugar.  Cooked for 11 minutes and they were great.  I didn't have a single cookie left, and d/h was mad that I didn't make a double batch!

These cookies were very easy to make and had a great flavor. I over baked them so they were a bit crunchy but that's my fault, they were still good. I made them for a daycare bake sale and my family wouldn't stop eating them. I am definitely going to make them again. VERY GOOD!

Excellent cookies! I refrigerated the dough for an hour before rolling it out and cutting into shapes. These flew out of the cookie jar which I found super impressive given that my family is more of the chocolate cookie loving type.

These are great.  Rolled them out and cut them into duck shapes for a baby shower.  Used the Sugar Cookie Frosting (from this site) to outline the cookies in yellow and then used Sugar Cookie Icing (from this site) to fill them in.  They were a hit at the baby shower.

By far THE best sugar cookies ever!  As a girl I couldn't stand making them because they always came out hard.  Not with this recipe!! They are perfect and soft, and melt in your mouth.  I froze one batch and we just made some more last night.  Our family favorite is to cover the top with M&M's before baking!

The cookies were OK, for my first time. They needed to be a little more sweeter. I might make this again, definitely with more sugar.

Perfectly soft and chewy. I slightly burnt mine by overbaking them by about 2 mins ( you can tell looking at them..) but I still can't stop eating them..My husband and I love them. I will make them again this weekend for a halloween party and roll them in black/orange sugar. Thanks for this great, easy recipe!!

Decent texture, but WAAAY to salty for me.  I should have followed my instincts and cut it down to 1/2 tsp.

These were good, not great, I cooked for 9 minutes and they were perfect.  I also chilled the dough for an hour.

I have been searching for a sugar cookie that is just that, a sugar cookie.  THIS IS IT!  Soft, chewy, simple.  Good balance of sweetness!  Chilling the dough made forming balls easier.  All I did was roll into 2" balls and press them into decorating sugar to flatten out.  Baked up nicely and were all gone in 2 days.  Making more today!  Thanks!

Fantastic!!!  Easy recipe.  I used only margarine and the cookies still turned out great.  I frosted them with fluffy white frosting and topped some of them with red sprinkles and some with chocolate jimmys.  My son and husband loved them.  I have another Christmas cookie to add to my list...YUMMY!!!

DON'T DO CUT-OUTS with this recipe.  Or, if you do, don't roll it too thin!  I cut 24 pumpkin shapes out (24 servings) but I should have left the dough thicker than 1/4".  I took them out of the oven just as they started to brown, but they were already crispy.  Next time I'll roll in balls as recommended! :)

I've been searching for a good soft sugar cook recipe, but most have a cake consistancy rather than cookie. This recipe was perfect! The cookies came out soft and not too sweet.

These were good.  I did use  the bottom of a glass to flatten them some.  I used 1/2 tsp of salt and they still tasted a little salty.  They were good, but not my favortie.

There's no other rating but 5 stars. Don't make any alterations to this recipe. I made these cookies using the Sugar cookie glaze on this site. They taste just like the popular "BOO" cookies from a famous bakery here in Cincinnati.

I made these cookies today and hoped they would come out as full and thick looking as the picture, maybe need to add a bit more flour next time. Overall it was a very good cookie.  Will make again.

Soft, sweet, and yummy...this is what I was looking for in a sugar cookie recipe. This one had all of those qualities, but it also had a taste of baking powder that I didn't care for. Maybe it was just me, but I found it unpleasant. If I make these again, I may reduce the amount of baking powder slightly. All in all, they are tasty, easy, pretty cookies...thanks for sharing!

fantastic!!!! these cookies are alot like the sugar cookies my grandmother made when i was a kid.(long time ago) first time i made them didn't change a thing..second time--divided the dough in half-left half untouched-the other half added 1 tsp. almond extract and dipped them in coconut-baked them in upper- half of the oven to prevent the coconut from burning.  will continue to make these wonderful cookies!!!  i also found that this recipe doubles easily...

Great- as someone else said, the cookies are not overly sweet, so you could definitely frost them, although I did not. They were very soft, although I wouldn't describe them as chewy. And using my small scoop I got easily double the 24  that it says- I say easily because I have 50 cookies and ate some dough along the way :). Great easy recipe- will definitely use again!

The curse is broken!  For years, I have tried making a good sugar cookie, but despite trying recipe after recipe, I was never successful until now.  I followed this recipe verbatim and it came out perfect!  I just added vanilla frosting and decorative sprinkles!  I can't wait to try this at an upcoming cookie exchange!

These are soft but not chewy.  I substituted one teaspoon of orange flavoring for one of the teaspoons of vanilla. It gave them a wonderful summer zest.  I made these as favors for a wedding and received many compliments on the flavor.  I used an ice cream scoop to drop them on the cookie sheet (5 to a sheet), flattened them with a glass plate coated in colored sugar and baked them as directed for 11 minutes.

If you like a soft cake-like cookie as I do, this is the one for you. And if you're also like me in that you hate rolling dough, you'll like them twice as much!  Definitely want to chill the dough before working with it. I just made them for the first time, and made 24 as the recipe suggests and they were huge and it was a bit difficult to get them baked in the center!  Next time I think I'll make 30 cookies.  I took one readers suggestion and rolled some of them in cinnamon/sugar and the rest in plain granulated sugar.  Of course, the sky's the limit there; they'd be wonderful with colored sugars for the holidays and, as some other readers did, they can be frosted as well.  I'm thinking too that I might try adding some cocoa to the dry ingredients (perhaps 1/2 C.  to make them a chocolate cookie. Has anybody else done that?  If so, how did that turn out?

I made this cookies with the 'Sugar Cookie Frosting' from this site as well. These cookies are very soft and don't require a lot of work, making them easy. The cookies were perfect at 9 minutes and they're still soft the next day. This is a definite keeper recipe. I need to play around with it a little bit to make them roll-out cookies and they'll replace my old sugar cookies at Christmas ^_^

These cookies are soft, w/ a cake like texture but a much finer, sturdy crumb. They are JUST like the lofthouse cookies you find in the store. They will stay really soft as long as you do not over bake them. I add a bit of almond flavoring to them and they are to die for!

These cookies were ok after baking & cooling they were more like cake cookies. We didn't care for them much the next day because they were crunchy. We were hoping for a super soft sugar cookie. The flavor was pretty good and they were sweet without being overly sugary.

These are amazing! Thick and soft, they are great with butter cream frosting. I used salted butter so I only added a pinch of salt to the dough, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I baked them for 10 min and half way through I turned the trays around and put the top one on the bottom and the bottom one on the top rack for even baking. This ones a keeper.

I tried a batch of these cookies over the weekend.  They were being swallowed right from the cookie sheet.  Most of the 1st batch never made it to the cooling rack.  They were a big hit.  Definitly making these again.  Very much recommed this for anyone looking for an easy soft cookie recipe.

Delicious! You have to try this recipe for yourself to believe how great they are. I followed the recipe to the T and they came out perfect. So perfect in fact that I had to hide some from my family just to get to enjoy them too! Thanks for a fab recipe, I'll be coming back to this one again and again.

I'd been debating over a few sugar cookie recipes and chose these because I saw pictures of some that were used with cutters.  Tried and it and absolutely loved it.  Was very quick and easy to put together and didn't require too long to be chilled to roll out.  Will make these again and again. *Edit: Needed a quick sugar cookie recipe for my daughter's birthday tomorrow and whipped these up at 10:30pm and took 20 minutes.  Love it!!

These are perfect! I accidentally slightly over-baked mine, and they're still great! I love the fact that this recipe doesn't use cream of tartar, and that you don't have to chill the dough.

This is my new favorite sugar cookie!  The texture and flavor are "perfect".  I made them exactly according to the recipe.  We rolled some in plain sugar and some in pink sugar. Thanks for sharing!

This was just an awesome recipe!! I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said!!! I did make some modifications substituting 1 cup of whole wheat flour, adding a tad more baking powder and using raw sugar. They turned out great!!  I did skip the part about rolling them in sugar, and I'm glad I did because I thought they were plenty sweet enough -or maybe that's just the raw sugar. I will try to use 1 cup butter and 1/3 cup shortening in my next batch.

I just made these for my little brother and they are really good. They would be even better if you omitted the colored sugar. They are so easy, I didn't even chill the dough just rolled and baked. Nice and soft.

i made this and forgot to add the eggs, also i rolled it in too much cinnamon. so the end result came out too sweet and i bet even if i did add eggs to it, it would still taste bad, no offense. i didnt like it one bit. the only thing i liked about it was that it was soft.

I used all butter and no shortening (I like the butter flavor better!) and made sure it was softened before making the batter.  I made these about a tablespoon each and ended up with almost 50 cookies.  I rolled each cookie in the crystal multi-colored sugar and slightly pressed each with the bottom of a glass.  Because they were smaller I took them out after about 8 minutes and 30 seconds and they were perfect.  These cookies came out beautifully and were delicious.  A big hit in my 3rd grade class Easter party!

Followed the recipe and they were quite bland. I later added some almond flavoring to the rest of the batch and did not help too much.

I made these cookies last night, and If I didn't stop my husband he would have eaten them all. I have been searching for a long time for a chewy sugar cookie, and now my search has come to an end. Cookies came out just perfect, and the recipe is so easy!!

These came out pretty good. My girlfriend brought over some of her dough so we could bake together and mine came out a little better than hers. This was my first time making sugar cookies. I would definatly make these again. Thanks for sharing.

These were easy to make, and I made them exactly as the recipe was written except with the addition of orange zest as one person suggested. I thought they were a little bland, even with the zest.

This is a great sugar cookie recipe. Very easy to make and they taste great.  It is not what I was looking for.  I am looking for a recipe for the sugar cookies they have in the grocery store--they are round and have great frosting.  They are a very soft cookie. I will definitely make these cookies again!

Sooooo good!  I did use butter flavored shortening just because that's what I had on hand, so not sure how much that affected the recipe, but this is for sure my go-to sugar cookie from now on.  Really moist and just the right mix of fluffy and dense.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The cookies come out so soft and chewy. I have made these cookies over a dozen times. I recommend using vanilla frosting on these cookies, if you want to make it a little more sweet. It will make these cookies all the more irresistible. Once you set them out, they will be gone in a flash.

I liked these,but they did not flatten out much, also would cut down on the salt.  Did not stay really soft, more on the chewier side & alittle hard but not crunchy.

I just made these for my son's pre-school St. Patrick's day party. We used green food coloring in half the dough and they came out wonderful. They taste so good I am afraid I will find an excuse to make them way too often.

These were great! The shortening is really key.  I left them in for about ten minutes - enough for the outside to be slightly crunchy but the inside to be super moist, even throughout the next few days.  I tried flattening them and using my cookie cutters for one of the batches, but this recipe and it's softness does really work best when it's rolled into balls. The cut-out cookies were good too, though!  Please everyone, don't overcook these! I saw a review of someone mentioning that they were so hard/inedible, so keep them in a few minutes less if you need to! I imagine it's hard to screw these up otherwise.

I made these for Valentine's Day after looking at a few recipes on here. This was by far my favorite and the only one I'll use now! Thanks! (I used a store bought sugar cookie icing and it was very good with that as well)

These were okay, too much of a flour taste. They were soft but not chewy.  The second batch we made we only used 2C of flour and they were much better.

Wow, now this is what a sugar cookie should be like!  Simple and sugary.  I LOVE the texture of these.  I only made 1/2 batch, and used all butter (since I found out my shortening had gone bad).  They turned out terrific.  I will make these again!

These cookies were great! They had a realy great flavor.  However, my reasons for giving them 4 stars are A. I used less than half the butter and shortening called for in the recipe and these were still plenty soft and chewy and delicious. B. Next time I will cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp. The cookies have a sit of a salty after-taste. With or without the suggested changes, I strongly suggest you give this cookie a try.

these were rather tasty!  i definitely enjoy my sour cream soft cookie recipe better.  i made these as a rolled cookie to do valentine cut-outs.  with a little extra flour on the board, the consistency was fine but they just weren't quite as tasty as my regular ones.  they also were chewier right through.

I have made this recipe for the last 2 years at Christmas time.  The most wonderful sugar cookies ever!! The only bad thing is they don't last very long around here and I have to make them several times during the Christmas season.  They go great with the  Decorator frosting recipe.

Super easy! Super yummy! Soft and tasty cookies. I made half this recipe to try it out. I didn't soften the butter, but creamed it while still firm. The dough was a bit sticky, but a small amount of added flour as I rolled did wonders and didn't make them dry. I added a bit of orange zest, as I had some in season from my mom's trees, and WOW! It added a fantastic little flavor. They didn't spread much, bit did pillow a bit if cut thickly. I am going to try frosting these later, but this batch is so good, we may finish them before they cool ^_^

I was a little disappointed. The cookies didn't spread out so turned out mound-shaped, and weren't chewy, more cake-y. Don't get me wrong, they were still OK, but not what they were "supposed" to be.

I didn't think these cookie were as awesome as everyone else. The only flour I had in the house was Wheat. I do not recommend using that in this recipe. I guess I should have known that but I didn't think about it. The cookies were great and I would give them another try with white flour.

Better than the best sugar cookie recipe I had before this one!  Ridiculously delicious.  I helped myself to a couple as they cooled off and it was all I could do not to eat a plateful of them.  Did not alter ingredients, only changed the serving size to 36 (original recipe yield was 24) which made the butter/shortening measurements a nice easy-to-measure 1 cup each amount and gave me 6-7 dozen cookies.  Don't worry, I have 3 kids and a hubby who will make short work of these.

Great soft sugar cookie!  I agree with one poster that they tasted just a TAD salty (I used unsalted butter and the 1tsp salt called for) so maybe just a 1/2tsp next time.  But definately take them out between 10-12min and if you want soft cookies... no browning on the bottom!  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This could use more flavor to it - I reduced the flour and added more sugar. I also added more vanilla and some orange extract. You have to press the balls of dough down - they will not flatten on their own as they bake. I frosted them once they cooled with homemade frosting (shortening, powdered sugar, vanilla extract) and sprinkled cotton candy flavored sugar over it. The cookies were nice and soft and didn't last very long!

These were great!  Nice, soft and buttery, the way I like them.  I usually roll these in crushed candy canes, but three little elves got into the candy canes this year.  Instead, I dried crushed dum-dums.  They turned out pretty well, but mostly because the cookie itself is so good!  Thanks for sharing!

Very very delicious! They were so easy to make and were the softest cookie. My family could eat a whole batch in one night! I also use the recipe as a dough to make coconut cookies and candy cookies.

Excellent sugar cookie recipe!  Even my husband (who is not a fan of sugar cookies because they are often crunchy) was pleasantly surprised and raved about the recipe.  This will definately by our official sugar cookie!

These are wonderful cookies! I've just taken the last pan out of the oven. Good timing since the rest of them were already gone. My 18 year old son said these are the best sugar cookies he's ever had. I use self rising flour so I left out the baking soda and salt. They were still awesome! Now I have to hide some for the other kids!

Very nice cookie!  I will be making again.  Sometimes sugar cookies taste bitter -  not these, just very nice and sweet.  Easy to make!

Nice soft cookie, a little floury tasting. I added extra vanilla. I probably won't make again.

These are a good quick cookie to use in a hurry but they are too salty. I will try them again with only half the salt.

Although I prefer a chewier sugar cookie, these aren't bad.  They have more of a shortbread-like consistency.  I added a little extra salt and a splash of additional vanilla to enhance the flavor.  I also stirred in some red and green M&M's to make them festive (yum!).  The next time I make these, I will probably use all butter and no shortening.

These did not turn out well for me. They were dry, and tasted kind of strange.
I don't claim to be a great baker, so it could just be my technique. Since everyone else is raving, I'm guessing the mistake was on my part.
I found many of mine crumbled apart, the dough did not stick together well. Also, the cooking time was much shorter than what was listed.
I probably used too much flour or something.

I'm giving these a 4-star because I accidently put baking soda instead of baking powder in the cookies. They tasted horrible like that but maybe i'll have to try again!

These did indeed stay soft, they definately should be flattend if you don't want to eat dough balls.  Even after cutting the salt in half,  we can still taste in.  My son was disappointed in them - they weren't sweet enough even though we rolled them in sugar.  My daughter and I think they're okay, but not good enough to make again.

Excellent. They were soft, sweet, full (had to press them even!), and a dash of sugar on top made them heavenly. A great recipe I will use again.

These cookies are nothing like the pictures. The taste is good but they didn't flow out they stayed in the ball form and after baking they crumbled horribly... but i've had worse. I wouldn't give them a blue ribbon though unless they were the only contestant.

This was a good, basic, well- textured sugar cookie.  I made a glaze with almond flavoring because I thought the cookie could use a bit of flavor.  Over all a good sugar cookie.

These were awesome very easy recipe, but i would not refrigerate these again. I would bake them right after mixing them. They turned into little puff balls rather than a cookie. Wow what taste though.

One of the few recipes that does not require the dough to be refrigerated prior to baking.  The dough rolled in sugar is awesome!  My co-workers loved these!

Super simple. I like how light and delicate mine were. I did not overmix the dough, and I put it in the freezer between batches and that helped quite a bit. I used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond which we really like. I even made thumbprints out of 1 batch and they were great too. Thanks, I'll use this again.

Thought these were delicious! Very soft with buttery texture, got a little distracted while adding the flour so not sure if I added 3 1/2 cups or four either way it didn't seem to effect the flavor and outcome, topped with Butter Frosting from this site. Great!

Great cookies!  I was looking for a no-roll replacement for a recipe my Grandma gave me because I just don't have the patience for rolling out cookies.  This recipe was fantastic!  Slightly crispy on the outside, but very soft on the inside.  I did flatten the cookies slightly with a cup before baking and ended up chilling one batch of dough before rolling into balls but the dough is so nice that you don't need to chill.  I frosted them with a lemon frosting and they are great.  Definitely a keeper!

You mean NOT so soft sugar cookie.  These were crunchy and very dry. They should be called Shortbread.  These aren't a sugar cookie at all. they went into oven round, and came out round.  They taste great, but texture is waaaaaay off.  Sorry.  This one is not good.

I forgot til the last minute that I was supposed to make cookies for my daughter's camping trip(for treats on the way). Found this recipe and LOVE it! It's so easy and they come out fantatic. I had to taste on from the first pan to see how they were. It was so tempting to eat more, but had to save some for the kids!

I sure it would have tasted better with baking powder... but i was out and used baking soda instead. (yes, i AM an idiot) but i dont think sure a small change will make them taste so bad though. I dont know. This is the first time I ever made cookies that taste like cornbread rather than sugar cookies. .... and bad tasting corn bread at that.

Fantastic!!!  I have tried multiple sugar cookie recipes, and these are, by far, the best.  They are soft but not crumbly, and taste even better with icing.  The cookies bake beautifully, making for a nice treat to share with friends.

I'm picky with sugar cookies and this recipe is the best I've ever had.  My husband asks me to make it all the time.  What caught my eye about this recipe over all the other sugar cookie recipes is that this one was a Blue Ribbon Winner, and I have to say it sure lives up to that claim.  It's delicious!

I made these according to the recipe, but I did not roll the balls in sugar and I did not flatten them. I did refrigerate the dough for a bit, as my kitchen was warm. The balls were between ping pong ball and golf ball sized. I baked just until there was slight browning around the edges, about 10 minutes, but this could vary, as my dough was cold from the fridge.  They are especially yummy when topped with a few chocolate chips and heated in the microwave 10 - 20 seconds. Scrumptious!

Oh My Gosh!  I made these cookies, and at first I was not sure about them, because they did not spread like cookies usually do and looked like a button, but the taste was fantastic!  I brought them to work and no one could eat just one, including me!  LOVED THEM!

I can't believe anyone could mess this one up.  I have made it many times with my granddaughter, and each time it comes out great!  I did change the amount of granulated sugar to 1 3/4 cups, added into the recipe.  We shaped the dough into balls, and rolled into colored sugar.  What a wonderful recipe.  Thank you!

I originally wanted to go with a different sugar cookie recipe that i found but was missing one of the ingredients so i used this one instead!  they turned out great!  they were extremely soft and now the next day are a little more chewy...which is even better!  i'm glad i decided to go with this recipe!  my husband tried them and called them "dangerously good"!!  they aren't going to last long!

Been meaning to review this since Nov.  My family raves over this when ever I make it.  I've topped the cookies with buttercream icing, and also a thin icing. Best sugar cookie recipe ever!

I was really excited to try this recipe after reading all of the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and was thouroughly disappointed with tastless cookies that weren't even soft! I'm sorry I wasted my time and ingredients.

This is such a good recipie! I have never made sugar cookies before and from what i herd is they are not easy! but let me tell you these are very easy! My friends and i had a girls day and made them, they were so fun. We just kept rolling them out and cutting out shapes. If you want to be creative and had cut your own shapes into the dough, you can! These go perfect with the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipie on here!

Wow, so good.  I don't bake...ever, but the snow was falling (in march :() and I got the urge to, um, bake.  These were so good!  I wanted a recipe I didn't have to chill or roll, and this fit the bill!  These come out of the oven looking the same as they go in, so make them the size you want them.  I baked for exactly 10 minutes and they didn't look done, they were white on the top, but the bottoms were browned and perfect, so don't bake too long!  Topped with 'butter frosting for sugar cookies' from this website, excellent!  Only change to this recipe, added almond extract instead of vanilla and some lemon juice.  MMMM thanks :)

These are really good, tasty cookies, and I love the softness.  It really deserves a 4 1/2 rating, I just was hoping they would spread out more when cooking.  Next time I'll flatten the balls out a little.  The dough was perfect to work with though, and 10 minutes in the oven was right on.  Frosted with the "sugar cookie frosting" from this site and they taste great.

this is the easiest and best sugar cookie recipe i have ever tried! i topped these with a smear of white pineapple vanilla frosting and sprinkles (pureed pineapple in the frosting adds a touch of vitamin c so i don't feel so horrible giving these to my two year old!)

To tell you the truth, I don't like sugar cookies.  At all.  But I promised I'd make them, and so I came looking for a good recipe.  These are the first cookies gone, even before the chocolate chip, and I even eat them!  They keep their shape well when baking, and stay soft after you bake them.  Great recipe, thanks!

Excellent!  I didn't have any shortening, so I used all butter, which worked great.  I didn't roll the balls in sugar, and I thought they were perfectly sweet without the added sugar :-) Delicious!

These are a dull basic boring sugar cookie that tastes no different than the premade stuff in the cold case. I was expecting some great recipe considering the reviews. I was disapointed. Try "best rolled sugar cookies" instead

This recipe was easy to follow and they turned out beautiful! The cookies were soft and chewy. However, they had a hint of "playdough" flavor to them. Perhaps adding more vanilla or sugar would help?

Not sure what happened with this recipe for me, but they did not turn out. I tried using all butter, but I read another review that used all butter and it was fine. These ended up not spreading or browning. Tossed in the garbage!

Very delicious cookies! I'm usually not a big fan of sugar cookies, but these are so good you can't help but love them. They are so easy to make you can do it with your kids. My 4 year old son had a blast helping me make these.

I dont know what went wrong. Maybe after i put the flour in the cream mixture i was suppossed to mix by hand instead of the blender ? This turned out really gooey and i had to " drop " the dough in instead of roll because it kept sticking to my hands. Other than that, after they were done baking about 20 minutes, they looked like biscuits, but tasted pretty good.

Not thrilled with these--was REALLY hoping for a soft cookie---these turned out HARD---had to bake them longer than stated because they had not browned at all.  Flavor was good.

WOW.  These definitely deserved that blue ribbon.  Omitted the salt with no repercussions.  Also, I made these much larger (golf ball sized balls of dough) and baked them 4 to 6 minutes longer to make super-large, SUPER cookies.  Keeper recipe.  Update 2/12/09 made "regulation" size balls and baked for 10-11 minutes -- fabulous as always.  Thanks again!

These were delicious and flew off the plate!  I used butter flavored Crisco stick as the shortening which made for very buttery flavor.  Rolled them in colored sugar and slightly flattened them before baking.  Definitely will make these often.

I wasn't impressed by this cookie. I thought they looked great, but not much flavor. They may be better with frosting.

I love how these cookies turned out.  I only used 1/2c butter and they still turned out great.  Use a 1/4 measuring cup to measure out the dough and you get big soft bakery-like cookies.  Will make again

The way that they were raved about I was really expecting more from this cookie. They weren't amazing yet they weren't terrible just sort of okay. I too had trouble with the cookie being not as sweet as i would've like and i added an extra 1/4 c anticipating this to be a problem, they still were a little boring. They took longer than 15 minutes to cook, they ran into each other, puffed up weird, and we're just not that great.

I made these with my 4- and 10-year-olds, exactly as the recipe is written. They were fast and easy. The texture and taste were perfect--I thought they had just the right level of sweetness. The only downside, for me, is the shortening, since I normally don't use it, but I will have to keep some on hand now for these cookies.

Great recipe.  I also added a little lemon juice to part of the mix, and some almond extract to another part.  I decorated them for V-day, with help from my 14 month old twins.  It was really fun.

I would give these a five - though make sure you're making good sized cookies and go for shorter cooking times - but you could taste the baking powder a little bit. Maybe i should have sifted again??

I thought these were great!  I liked the fact that they are fluffy and not too too sweet.  Next time I may reduce the shortening and cream the mixture better as sometimes you taste the Crisco.  Overall they were WONDERFUL!

These are good, but could use a little more flavor. Another tsp of vanilla or some spices or something. But the texture is perfect and they bake out nicely into neat little circles.

I read the other reviews so I adjusted the salt (1/2 tsp) and added another 1/4 cup of sugar. Instead of rolling it in white sugar, I mixed white sugar and cinnamon and rolled the dough into that mixture and I must say, It was the WOW I was looking for!! My boyfriend liked them so much, they pretty much dissapeared. Loved it!!

Very delicious, moist cookies.  My brother insisted that they were shortbread cookies.  The dough worked pretty well with cookie cutters after I chilled it for an hour.  I will make these again.

These tasted pretty good, but they just weren't the "wow" I was looking for.  I think I expected something more like the sugar cookies you buy in the store, and these didn't flatten out quite the same way and weren't chewy at all.

These were exactly what I was looking for. I used 1 cup of butter and 1/3 c. of shortening and decreased the salt because of other reviews. I also flattened them after the first batch came out like mushroom caps! =) My kids and I frosted them instead of rolling them in sugar. A very simple recipe that was really quick to put together. Thank you!

This is definitely a great recipe!  The dough was a little softer than expected (even after chilling) but held up really well with cookie cutters!  Cooked really quickly and they tasted great too! The best I have ever tried!!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because although I liked the fact that it was easy to make, it did seem more like a shortbread cookie, and the taste was just OK. Didn't taste like the traditional sugar cookie I'm used to. I made it to a "T". DEFINATELY flatten the cookies, as I didn't the first batch and had puffy shortbread cookies!

Why anyone would have a problem with this recipe is beyond me. I have to follow the recipe to a tee because I'm not smart enough to make changes on my own. super cookies. Hint: cool the sheet before adding the next batch.

I thought this cookie was more like a shortbread cookie. It was definetly not like any sugar cookie I've ever had. Would have been good as a thrumbprint cookie with some rasberry preserves in the center.

These were okay. They were sort of bland; almost as if the batter wasn't sweet enough. Although, I do have to say they were fairly moist.

I am impressed!!! They are soft and tasty. Like other bakers i flattened them a little with a glass. I also sprinkled orange sugar on top just before baking for a Halloween touch. Perfect!!My man's fussy about his sugar cookies and i found his favorite with your recipe.. Thanks a bunch!

I did not like this recipe at all.  You can really taste the shortening, and it's way too salty.  The one redeeming quality is the texture.  It is soft, without being greasy.

This recipe was pretty good, except for one important thing, these cookies were not soft. They also didn't flatten out like cookies, they pretty much kept the ball shape. As for taste, they were great!

first off let me start by saying this cookie has good flavor but the downside is i found that the dough got crumbly, but i still was able to form my cookies. another fall on my part was that i put the cookies in a couple minutes more, so they turned out a little hard but still every good. thanks for the nice recipe.

Excellent, delicious, soft and chewy cookies.  I had a lot of fun making these as well.  The butter, sugar, and shortening come together with the flour mixture as a very soft and pillowy mixture.  My son and husband devoured these wonderful cookies.

These are the first truly soft sugar cookies I have ever made.  I added cherry baking chips at my husband's request, and the cookies turned out great.  They weren't greasy or cakey, just soft and delicious.  I think this will be a recipe I keep coming back to.

Very good, very soft. Great flavor. When I made these, both kids and adults really liked how they tasted. Rather than sprinkling sugar on the tops, I frosted with butter frosting. Definitely will make again.

i was kind of skeptic about using this recipe, but i like butter cookies that you buy at the store. i made these for santa clause on chirstmas eve with my 5 year old son. we had lots of fun with the cookie press. i didnt refridgerate the dough as it was thick anyways and it worked great that way. they were a little bland but we whipped up some butter cream frosting form all recipes that worked great with this recipe.

i followed some of the advice of others that wrote in and rolled the cookies into bigger balls (golf ball size) and then pressed them down a bit with a glass.  they came out just like i wanted.  big, soft, chewy.  i didn't do the sugar as i thought they'd be yummy with frosting on top.

Mine turned out soft, but a little dry. Frosting would've helped. Also, try making bigger balls or flattening them a bit, since they don't really spread out at all. Overall, pretty good

These were really good.  I made these after screwing up another sugar cookie recipe and needed something fast and easy to send to my boyfriend in Washington.  I stored the leftovers in a container with some mint cookies and these took on the flavor of the mint and were even better. Next time I may have to throw in a little mint extract just for fun.

These sugar cookies are wonderful.  I would recommend placing a larger amount of dough on the baking pan, though, since the cookies do not expand much.  This is a recipe I will continue to use and will recommend to others.  Thank you!

This recipe tasted really good, and was soft--but to me it really doesn't taste like sugar cookies.  I guess I was expecting them to taste like a roll-out only thicker and soft.  I think the recipe is more like a snickerdoodle only without the cinnamon.  This recipe is alot easier then my roll-out recipe, so I'll make these when I don't have time to make the real thing.

Oh MAN these were good! Was the 3rd sugar cookie recipe I'd tried in 2 days and even though I couldn't make cut-outs with this, they TASTED AWESOME. Best cookie I've tasted all year hands down, w/ or w/o frosting, no wonder it was a winner. Used a 2" cookie scoop (produced a 3" cookie), baked for 12-15 min. Little crispy outer edges at 15 min. but still SOFT in the middle, puffed up a little in center. Flattened next pan slightly w/ glass to make a more even cookie and baked for 12 m. let set few min. on pan, still slightly crispy edge/soft center but looked better (because of the flattening). 3rd pan baked 11 min. let sit couple min. still slightly crispy etc. so prob. more like 10 min. I also chilled the dough overnight.

I was disappointed. I was expecting them to keep their shape but they didn't. I placed them 2 inches apart but they spread out. I like round cookies, not square-ish ones that have obviously been chopped apart. Nice texture but pretty bland taste. I doubt I'll make them again.

This recipe makes great, soft cookies.  The only thing i would add to the instructions is to press down and flatten the dough a bit after you roll them into balls, because they don't spread out much at all in the oven.  The bottom of a glass, or the palm of your hand get the job done.

I loved these cookies!! I didn't have any shortening, so I used butter. I also added just a dash of almond extract. I only chilled the dough for 30 minutes, sprinkled flour on top and molded the cookies into the shapes I wanted. They came out awesome. Really tasty, festive treats with green icing for St. Patty's Day! I no longer need to search for a good sugar cookie recipe.

This cookie is best served at room temperature with a big o' glass of milk. 
The recipe was a little vague. I found that it was best to flat the ball of cookie dough with the sugared bottom of a glass before baking so that the middle got completely done.
Over all it was a wonderful cookie. No wonder it won a Blue Ribbon!
