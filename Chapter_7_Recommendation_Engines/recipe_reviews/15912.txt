I made the nog with soy milk and pumpkin pie spice mixture and it was wonderful!
It has all the creamy, spicy holiday flavor of egg nog without all the fat and sugar.
Yum!

Made it for the holidays and enjoyed it. It was strong tasting to me, but some nogs are like that.
Making it fresh is real important. Since I can't have real sugar, I was happy to find this recipe.
2003 update - This New Year, I omitted the sweetener and rum, then used 1/2 cup of Da Vinci Sugar-Free Egg Nog syrup. My guests didn't know it was sugar free. I made it ahead and added a little milk to thin it. Got rid of the strong taste.

Used a little Splenda (to taste) and vanilla flavoring since we had no rum...(flavoring, that is!). This recipe is DELICIOUS and I can't wait to try it on my family at Thanksgiving! Thanks!!

I have been craving egg nog for weeks, but everytime I would look around in stores, all I could find was garbage laced with fat and sugar.  I was a bit nervous about the results because of the pudding, but this was dynamite.  If you were to do a blind taste test, people wouldn't have any idea that this was not real egg nog.  Awesome.

Try making this with almond milk--either regular or unsweetened vanilla. YUM YUM. I've been craving this (must be psychological, the holidays just hit)so I'm headed to the store after church to stock up on vanilla pudding and almond milk.

I used soy milk and it was perfect! It didn't even need the extra sweetener, and let me tell you nothing is sweet enough for me.
I'm so glad to finally find an eggnog recipe that isn't bad calorie-wise and still has the flavor and texture

This recipe is fine for anyone who is looking for a lighter version of the classic eggnog recipe.  However, it didn't seem to be quite thick enough, even cutting back on the milk by a half a cup.  I omitted the rum extract because I didn't have any on hand, and added more nutmeg to give it more of the eggnog flavor.  Overall, not bad.  I will try it again with some other modifications.

This was just ok.  Definitely did not taste like eggnog, more like thin vanilla pudding with spices.  Letting it sit in the fridge for 30 minutes is a must if you want your drink to be thicker.  It's not a bad taste, it's just not eggnog.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe and whether or not it could duplicate the eggnog flavor.  Let me just tell you, it's fantastic!  It's not as thick as regular eggnog but that's totally OK.  This healthy version is well worth it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  We will make this again and again and again.  The only change I made was to use Captain Morgan instead of rum flavor (and I used two tsps)

I've been looking for YEARS for a great low-fat sugar-free eggnog recipe and this is the best one I have ever tried. It tastes just like the real thing! I make mine in a blender with 2 or 3 ice cubes (add ice cubes at the very last, after blending all the other ingredients) and it whips up thick and rich.

I love this stuff. I made mine with 4 cups of unsweetened almond milk and added a short of sugar free french vanilla torani syrup as a sweetener. Making it with this almond milk reduced the calories to 68 per 8 ounce serving. YUM! Thanks for the recipe

I'd just use the soynog at stores, but its so full of sugar! I made this one with almond milk, so it wasn't quite as thick, and had a slightly nutty flavor which required quite a bit more spices and rum flavor but overall great recipe for those who can't have dairy (use soy or almond)/sugar or either.

I do not think this tastes like egg nog at all, more like a milk shake flavored drink. I will see a different sugar free egg nog

This is really good, considering that it's OK for people who need to lose weight and/or are diabetic. But here's an important thing. The pudding tends to settle to the bottom of the pitcher no matter how hard you whisk it. To avoid that, put two cups of the milk in a blender and slowly add the pudding mix. Blend it like crazy until it gets a little frothy. Then add it to the other three cups. That will eliminate most of the lumps and silt on the bottom. And use real rum. Cruzan is aged, very good, and affordable.

I added some Ground Cloves for extra spice. Plus like someone else adviced I used the blender and added a handful of ice. We let it set in the fridge for about 15 minutes for it to thicken a bit. Great recipe for diabetics and NON diabetics.

This is pretty good!  I made it with soy milk, so it was the antithesis of egg nog (no egg, no dairy, no sugar, lol), but it tasted like egg nog.  I will make this again.
Thanks!

My kids love eggnog, and just looking at this recipe I think I'll make it this year instead of buying. It will be so much cheaper. I'm going to try it with pumpkin spice jello instant pudding. My kids love the pumpkin spice eggnog we get every year.

I made this for Christmas morning. I used vanilla soymilk instead of nonfat milk. I followed the recipe exactly for everything else. I used Splenda as the sweetner.  It was wonderful! Everyone loved it!! Highly recommended.

Loved it! exactly like eggnog. I thought I didn't have rum, so I added the vanilla instead, then found the rum extract, so I added it too. When it finished, it looked thin instead of thick, so I added another box of pudding. I should have known better with pudding to let it set, but I added the box anyway, and it's near drinkable pudding, so I'll add more milk and it'll be perfect!

I changed this up a bit and it was perfect for my husband and myself. I did 5 cups of almond milk - 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream - 4 ice cubes -  1 teaspoon of organic nutmeg  -  1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon of organic cinnamon, 1 packet of organic stevia -1 teaspoon of rum extract - 1 ounce pack of sugar free vanilla pudding. Added pack of pudding last and slowly so it would mix well. Added 4 ice cubes and blended again.  Left in fridge for 30 minutes before trying. Shook container before pouring it make sure spices mixed well. This was thicker and had an amazing taste. For those of us concerned with sugar and carbs....this hit the spot.  The heavy whipping cream adds a few more calories per cup, but, not the sugar.

The only change I made was to substitute Soy Milk to reduce carbs. It did make it pretty creamy. I found it pretty favorless for some reason. Didn't remind me of real eggnog.

Non fat milk basically defeats the purpose, as sugar is still there to make up for the lack of fat.  This is definitely not sugar free as it claims

I only wanted a cup for the evening.  Didn't have any instant pudding but I did have a container of sugar-free snack pack pudding.  Used 1 cup milk, container of pudding, 2 egg yolks, pinch of salt, Splenda to taste and garnished with nutmeg.  It was good!

This may be my favorite ever substitution recipe!! I love eggnog lattes and have not had one in years due to sugar and fat content. I warmed mine up in the microwave then stirred in some instant coffee - heaven! My husband (who doesn't give a hoot about sugar or fat) is enjoying his glass over ice with rum! So happy to find this recipe and not feel deprived this season!

I was disappointed, mostly because the vanilla pudding made it too thick for my liking.
