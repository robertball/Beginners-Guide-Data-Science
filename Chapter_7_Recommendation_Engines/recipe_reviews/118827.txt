Not as tall a cake as I had thought it would be, but I'm not complaining. It made for a mouthful of berries with every delicious, incredibly moist bite! I have to say I was really surprised. This cake is so rich and moist I am seriously considering adjusting the recipe to use for a two-layer yellow butter cake. Yep, it's that good, and has just the sort of texture, lightness and crumb so sought after for yellow cakes. I added 1/4 tsp. salt to a half recipe, which I baked in an 8x8 square pan. I found it took about 45 minutes, even for the smaller pan. I glazed it quite liberally, but found I still had some glaze left over, so next time I'll adjust that as well.  It's a pretty little cake too, and with its colors of red, white and blue would be an ideal choice for any patriotic celebration.

This is an EXCELLENT light and moist summer cake that was an absolute hit with my family.
I used butter and light sourcream and, despite my concerns that the batter appeared almost like a stiff dough, the cake baked to perfection.
I used a frozen mix of strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries for this one, defrosting them in the microwave on HIGH for 45 seconds before sprinkling them over the cake.
Also, I opted out of the glaze and instead made a crumble/streusel topping out of 2 tbsp. butter cut into 2 tbsp. all purpose flour, 1 tbsp. cinnamon sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, which I sprinkled over the berries before baking.  
It was absolutely to die for with French vanilla icecream!  Happy baking! :)

This cake was a huge hit. The most common comment was that they didn't like cake but loved this one. I was asked for the recipe by 3 people. This cake was very easy although it did take longer to bake than the recipe said. I also used more berries than called for. YUMMY!

Excellent.  Like others, I had to bake it much longer...almost a full 40 minutes longer.  I lightly covered with tin foil the last 20 minutes or so.  I halved the glaze and didn't use all of that, but think next time I will.

This recipe makes a tender and moist cake with good flavor.  I used frozen blueberries and blackberries that I defrosted before using.  Changes I would make the next time I make this: bake at 350º instead of 325º, and grease and flour the pan or use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.  I would also halve the frosting for the cake as I found it overpowered the fruit flavor.

Well, when the other reviewers say this is moist and delicious, they're not kidding!  I used strawberries and blueberries for mine.  I also added 1/2 t. salt to the dry ingredients.  I made half the glaze based on other reviewers and I still had more than enough.  Beautiful berries are in all the stores and markets this time of year, so give this a try.  You won't be disappointed!

I used to work at a restaurant and we served a cake very similiar to this. It was my Mom's favorite. This came really close. I baked it in a springform pan which definitely required alot more baking time. Before baking I topped it with fresh srawberries and blueberries. Afterwards I did not use icing, just powdered sugar. Great coffee cake!

I chose to make this cake based on the excellent reviews and that it used natural ingredients. I was disappointed. Its too much butter and sour cream in regard to the flour. When I tasted the cake it tasted moist and rich yes but far too fatty the texture was off and it didnt really resemble a cake. Also the volume of the glaze would be enough for at least 4 cakes. If I try to make this again, I think I would beat for a minimum of 10 minutes in my Kitchen Aid the eggs and sugar and then slowly add the butter and sour cream in reduced amounts. I suspect this would improve the texture of the cake. I must admit though I was really disappointed in the taste of the cake portion of this recipe because the raw batter tasted really good.  It also took over an hour to back. Furthermore I think that 1 1/4 cups of sugar is too much considering the massive volume of the recommended Glaze. I would highly recommend to lightly dust the fruit with flour before topping the cake batter.

I am so disappointed.  I was sooo excited to make this, the recipe and reviews were great.  I even had a camera ready so that I could add the final photo since this recipe has no image yet.  But, It turned out awful:(   1st. I had to bake it an extra 25 minutes! with foil on top because the edges were burning but the inside was still completely raw.   2nd. once I took it out it felt solid on top, but when I cut into it, it all fall apart due to the amount of berries in it.  3rd. I wasted my time and ingredients making a streusel topping because the berries and streusel sunk and the cake ended up baking over top of it all. I used 2 cups blue berries, and 1 cup of blackberries and raspberries; by far too many berries.  Next time I will stick to 2 cups blueberries or raspberries only.   I have confidence that this could be an amazing recipe so some day I will try it again and give it a better rating.  but for now I give a 3 because it has potential.

This is a nice cake.  It is VERY tender, and subtley sweet.  I did not add blueberries, but sprinkled raspberries with 2 TBSP of white sugar before baking.

Absolutely delicious cake! 5 stars ++ hands down. Like others, I added a ¼ tsp. of salt to the batter. I baked this in an 8X8 square pan. It took a few minutes longer for the cake to finish baking. The cake around the edge is nice and golden brown. It was crumbly when I bite into it which gave a nice texture. This cake is a moist, light and tender summer cake! It's fluffy and wonderfully delicious. I love the sweetness of the fresh berries. I had a mouthful of sweet juicy berries in every single bite…MMmm. They made for a beautiful looking cake, with its color of red, blue berries and the white tender cake. (see my photo on recipe page). I used half the glaze called for in the recipe and I still had more than enough. I also used fresh lemon juice in place of the vanilla extract for the glaze. I drizzled a little over the berries which added a nice flavor to the cake. I am pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this cake turned out! This is a delightful treat for all us today!

We loved this cake!  I made two cakes, following the recipe making no changes.  I froze one cake and drizzled the icing on after it was thawed.  It came out beautiful, and everyone gave it rave reviews.  I will be making this again soon!

This is simply amazing!  I used fozen berries because that is what I had on hand.  I just defrosted them slightly in the microwave first.  The cake was so tender and fluffy.  Even my husband that hates cake with any type of berry loved it.  I halved the recipe since there was just two of us but he ate half of the cake himsel!  I think I should have made the full recipe.  This is a wonderful base.  You could add so many differnt things from nuts to candy bars or even make the cake chocolate. Let your imagination run wild with this one.  You won't be disappointed.

First off, this cake was beautiful and the berries were delicious.  I used strawberries, blackberries and blueberries.  I also cut the recipe in 1/2 and baked it in a 9-inch springform pan for easier serving.  My only complaint is that because of the berries, the middle of the cake would not cook.  I did use fresh berries, so there was no extra moisture from using frozen berries.  If I had contined to bake the cake so that the middle was done, the edges would have been black.  Luckily, since this was just for the family, we ate around the middle, so it wasn't a total loss.  I just think there are much better "berry" cake recipe out there, and won't be making this one again.

This was pretty good - The fresh berries really make this dessert.  I suggest not using frozen if you can help it/afford it.  Although it's called cake, it's really more of a bar.  Even still, very tasty, pretty cake and the woman I made it for asked me to pass on the recipe :)
Oh, and like others I also had to let it bake for an additional 40 minutes to cook it fully in the center.  Also, I used about a quarter of the frosting but will use half next time. Any more than that would be too much and would cover up the fresh fruit taste.

This is an AWESOME recipe! I made this using the black raspberries and strawberries that we had growing here, but I think you could use any berries and it would be great! My husband even took some over to the neighbors and they loved it too! I will definitely make this again! DELICIOUS!!

Outstanding every time - I just made this again tonight for company with fresh berries from our garden and it got rave reviews.
The baking seems to take a bit longer than suggested, but this is a tried and true winner in my book.  I have used both fresh and frozen berries with great results.  I have always omitted the glaze as well, just our preference.

This cake is so light, moist, and tender! This is one of the fluffiest cakes I've ever had. It's cloud-like in its softness. Amazing texture, wonderful taste. Will make again and again and again.

The only change I made to the recipe was the berry combination (I used blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries). I didn't use all the drizzle either - probably because I just poured it over the cake still in the pan. My family LOVED it. The cake is great. I will make it again.

I thought this recipe was very good. Delicious, and it held up for several days after baking. Yum! It was definitely best on the first day. Perfect for a party.

This cake was soooo yummy that it disappeared in little more than a day and there were just 4 of us at home this week! The flavor of the berries was wonderful. There were enough berries but it would be good with more if you had them too. I follwed the recipe as written. It's kind of like a coffee cake. The recipe for glaze made way too much. I used probably only half of it and it was plenty on the cake. Next time, I will cut the glaze recipe in half. I make this cake regularly without the glaze but wanted to make it look extra pretty for Valentine's Day so I changed the serving size to 4 for just the glaze. It was the perfect amount!

Very versatile recipe! Could be used with just about any fruit. The cake is very most and dense. Not a typical cake, so if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed. I personally am not a traditional cake lover, but this one is a keeper in my recipe book! Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent, moist, fluffy and not too sweet.  I used only blueberries and opted not to use the glaze.  I baked it for 40 minutes longer though.  This is going to be a favorite for me!!!

Ok...this cake is really perfect. Unbelievable texture, not too sweet, stays very nicely for a few days. I didn't make the glaze because I wanted to put a limit on the sugar. You know what? It didn't need it. I topped it with fresh picked blackberries but will try something else next time. I didn't prefer the seeds. Can't wait to make it again. Easy and delish.

I loved this!  It did take about 30-40 longer to bake fully.  Very very moist.  I used more berries and raspberries were dominant by choice.  YUMMMMMM!

This was excellent! Everyone loved it.  Very moist.  It did take about 30 minutes additional to bake.  I had to cover with foil so the edges didn't burn or dry out with the additional baking time. But it turned out great!

Added in some lemon extract to the batter and the icing...excellent flavor!  This is such a moist and delicate cake.  A huge keeper in our house!  I made it the night before and it was so good the next morning for our guests and their coffee...wish I could give it 10 stars!

This recipes is the ultimate treat for your guests...they'll rant and rave. If you find yourself pressed for time, try a basic white cake mix adding berries of your choice to the mix just before pouring into the baking pan. Add cooking time to compensate for additional moisture cause by the berries and keep a close eye on the cake during the final minutes of baking. May require 10-20 minutes additional baking time from the mix recommendation. Soooooo Good.

2-13-16 ~ What a delicious and moist coffee cake. I made this with blueberries and raspberries that I had in the freezer. I partially thawed them before adding to the batter. I cut the topping ingredients in half, and still had more than enough. I took this to TN on a visit to our son and DIL.

this was a huge hit for memorial day!  however, the berries sank into the cake. I may wait to add the berries until half way through the bake time. I took the advise of another and used light sour cream; couldn't tell the difference and I baked it for a total of 1 hour in a 9x13pan. only used about 1/3 of the glaze.

I made this cake for our Memorial Day picnic yesterday and it turned out delicious! I made the cake with no changes, which I usually do the first time I try a new recipe. Like others have noted, the middle of the cake took much longer to cook than the edges. At the end of the suggested cooking time I had to cover the edges with tin foil to keep them from getting too crisp. 
I also might try halving the glaze next time just to cut back on the amount of sugar in the recipe. As others already noted, the glaze recipe makes a lot. 
The only tweak I made was topping it off with lots of fresh raspberries and blueberries, which means I had to keep it refrigerated. The result was a cool and refreshing summer cake with plenty of tasty berries in every bite. I will definitely make this one again. The family already wants me to make it again for the 4th of July picnic!

Firstly, I made a few substitutions. Rather than fresh/frozen fruit, I used a can of cherry pie filling. I poured it on top and then marbled it with the actual cake. Also, to make it slightly more cholesterol friendly, I put in 1/2 cup of applesauce in lieu of the 2 eggs.  This cake was wonderfully delicious. I was skeptical when it was cut, as the texture was very crumbly, and the bottom seemed far too brown. To my immense surprise and satisfaction, the cake was yummy, flavorful, and moist. It made a perfect base for the fruit and icing.  My complaint is very simple. There was far too much icing, and I ended up pouring more than 2/3's of it down the sink. However, it helped with flavor and moistness. I also didn't like the denseness of the cake. Although I am an avid white cake fan, this cake is very heavy, so make sure that if you're looking for something light, you don't make this one.

BEST CAKE EVER !! first cake I have ever made and it was a success - I used blueberries and strawberries on mine - the cake really doesn't need all of the drizzle ad it is already sweet from the berries. ENJOY!

Moist and delicious.  I prefer less glaze so only make half.  Best slightly warm.
