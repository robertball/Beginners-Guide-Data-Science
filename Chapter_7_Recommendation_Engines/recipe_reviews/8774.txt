This recipe turned out great, very tender and full of flavor!  Next time I'll probably try it in a shaking bag instead of dredging it though, as the flour and spice mix tends to clump and not cover the chicken entirely.

This chicken TASTED great but appearance-wise it could use a little help. It didn't brown up in the oven and the coating still had a very "floury" look to it. I will be making it again but I think I'll either drizzle it with olive oil before baking in the oven, or just fry it in oil or butter on the stove. I like the fact that the dish is so easy and quick to prepare but it needs a bit of tweaking.

Instead of using milk, I just sprinkled both sides with the Cajun seasoning.  Very, very simple recipe.  I used chicken tenders so it took very little time to cook, too.  My hubby loved it!

Make the following changes for a 5 star rating:  Swap panko for the flour, use an egg-milk wash, these two slight changes make ALL the difference!!!

After baking this in the oven, I fried it in sauted onion.  Very good with Jamie's Black Beans and Rice (also found on allrecipes.com)

If you are looking for a healthy dinner this would be it. Not bad for a health conscious diet. Otherwise, fry that sucker up and make it fat and tasty. It is kind of bland if you follow the recipe as it is.

Used whole chicken breasts instead of skinless, boneless & adjusted the cooking time.  Turned out wonderful.  My husband loved it.  And I was overjoyed that it was no muss; no fuss.

I read the reviews and definately agree that adding some more of the cajun spice is necessary for this dish.  I also read a review about frying in sauteed onions and this made the somewhat doughy breading more crisp and flavorful.  I added a bit of cumin to the onions as they where sauteeing.  Very good!  Will do again.

This recipe is surprisingly delicious!  Who knew something so simple could be such a great chicken recipe?!  The only changes I made were that I used egg to dredge the chicken instead of milk and then I mixed the flour with some seasoned panko crumbs to give it some more zest and then I used hot Creole seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning--very good--don't overlook this one!

Made quite a mess, might be too spicy for the kids, but you can always use less seasoning.  My husband said it was the best dish I've made yet!

Was just okay.  Flavor was kind of bland and really needed more of a kick.  I used 2 tsp's cajun spice and it was not nearly enough seasoning.  Not sure I would make it again because my kids didn't really like it that much.

The recipe was very good and easy but the only think i didnt like all the extra flour ontop of the chicken that didnt cook.  I think i will try this again but i will add some butter after about 10 min of cooking so it wont be so dry.

Chicken tasted okay, but it did not brown in oven, and was still floury.  I was a little bit disappointed as I normally love anything with Cajun spices.

Not really necessary to do the milk and flour thing because as another reviewer stated, it wasn't that good looking. Next time, it would be easier to just sprinkle some Cajun seasoning on the chicken.

The ease in preparing this recipe was more than offset by its bland taste.  I added FIVE teaspoons of seasoning and it still did not help.  Also, the fact that the chicken did not brown during cooking was very disappointing.  I will not be cooking this dish again.

Really quick and easy, but needs more spice.  Also, the next time I prepare this receipe, I think I will pan fry as the chicken does not get brown in the oven.

Okay, so tweaked it a little.  Used buttermilk with a few dashes of hot sauce to dip the chicken in and used 2T of cajun seasoning in the flour.  Then pan fried the chicken in some olive oil before putting in a 325 oven to finish off.  LOVED it.
