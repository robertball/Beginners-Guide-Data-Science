So easy and so delicious - what's Thanksgiving without cranberry sauce?  I love to make it homemade and this recipe was perfect.  All I added was a Tbsp. of orange zest and replaced a bit of the orange juice with some fresh squeezed. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Instead of water try a low acid variety of apple juice and skip the orange juice. Cranberries and apples seem to love each other.

This was super easy and much better than the canned stuff.  I did add a couple more tablespoons of brown sugar at the end as I prefer it on the sweeter side.   I think a little orange zest might be good in this too, I will try that next time.  Suggestion:  Wear a black shirt when making this, the berries can "pop" some of the juice on you if your not careful!

After I let it cool for about 10 minutes I added 1 apple peeled and diced and a 1/2 cup of walnuts. It is so delicious and easy!

I am  not really a fan of cranberry sauce, but have to say this recipe is really good. I like the simplicity of it and it just tastes fresh.  I chopped up half a Granny Smith apple and cooked that in with it.  Sweet with that tartness....so good.  I also didn't use water, just fresh squeezed orange juice.

Great flavor on this sauce; I did add a small piece of cinnamon stick as it cooked down which added a bit of spice to it.  Will be using this regularly.  Thanks Liz!

I had never made cranberry sauce before - but the recipe looked so easy I tried it - WOW - who knew it was so easy - love this recipe - I added a little bit of finely grated orange peel, like others suggested (also called orange zest - never knew zest was only the peel - none of the white part at all, which is bitter).  My family LOVED it, and I will never go back to canned.  It is a tart recipe - perfect for us - but if you prefer sweeter sauce, consider upping the sugar by a tablespoon or two.  Thanks so much for this new holiday tradition!

I thought this was great! I don't usually like Cranberry sauce but I love this! The only thing I did was grate a cinnamon stick for the cinnamon and then boil it with the rest of the stick in it. Pulled it out after boiling was done before I mashed it. I will be making this again and again for years to come!!

I just made this and I think it tastes great! I had to make an adjustment because I cannot have oranges or OJ. So I made it with a cup of water, added the zest of 2 small tangerines, and the juice of 2 tangerines. I probably should have used a little less than a cup of water, but there wasn't really much tangerine juice. The cinnamon I have is Saigon cinnamon, which is pretty strong, so the sauce is pretty "cinnamon-y." But I like it!

I have to say, I have never tried cranberry sauce of any kinf in my life. There was something about this recipe that sounded good so I made it. I have been missing out for a lot of years. This stuff is awesome. I added a little orange zest and mixed some apple juice with the water. It was fantastic!

This was the first cranberry sauce I’ve ever made or tasted. I made it twice and both times doubled the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written the first time Plus added about a teaspoon of orange zest. The second time I used apple juice and added some juice from 1/2 an orange. I preferred the sauce made with the apple juice and some freshly squeezed OJ. It had a milder, smoother flavor. The next time I make it, I’ll use apple juice and perhaps add another 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.

I'm making this now and tasting as I go along. It's easy, quick, delicious. I added a pinch of salt and some lemon juice to tone down the sweetness a bit. Tossed a couple of cinnamon sticks in, too.

Never made homemade cranberry sauce before. Love cranberries but hate the gelled canned stuff. Made as is but added a splash of Brandy at the end. Keep seeing my hubby and my daughter's boyfriend sneaking "tastes". This recipe is easy and delicious.

First time making homemade cranberry sauce and this is easy to make and delicious! It is just a tad too sweet so I will decrease sugar a little next time. I may try it with apple juice to make it less tart, though the sweet and tangy combination is very tasty!

Excellent homemade sauce!  I used apple juice in place of water, squeezed fresh oranges and added some zest, and added a small diced apple near the end.  Yummo!

Made as written except used a cinnamon stick instead of ground.  Very, very good taste.  The only problem?  EVERYONE PREFERS THE JELLY IN THE CAN. LOL.  I had to make real cranberry sauce- even if I was the only one who ate it. NICE RECIPE.

I just made it.  I needed to mash the cranberries after 15 minutes.  I did grate some orange zest into it and used the fresh cinnamon stick.  Taste is awesome, but it's not thick enough.  I hope it continues to thicken.

I used to have a recipe like this but you used a whole orange cut into small wedges and cooked with the cranberries.  I also used a whole large can of frozen grape juice.  It was delicious as I m sure yours is.  Not so much sugar.

This recipe was a big hit. The only change I made was to add more oranges juice and cur back on a little water. Turned out perfect!

This was good and easy to make. Definitely better than canned sauce.

I added a bit of orange zest, and a 1/4 cup of dried cherries. I am always looking for good recipe that is easy so I can cook with my girls. We had fun sharing in the process, I squeezed the oranges, Gracie did the zest and faith helped get the cranberries ready.

I hated cranberry sauce for years and years growing up, that jellied  stuff from a can. Bleck! Now i keep bags on hand in the freezer to make outside of thanksgiving and Christmas just to snack on, pair with pork, chicken, ice cream, sharp cheese.  This is perfect on its own, and also interesting with orange zest and/or about a half tbsp of grated fresh ginger.  Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe! I make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, following the recipe to the letter. The whole family loves it, and it's one of the first things they make sure I don't forget to make.

This is a very easy and delicious cranberry recipe.  I added a stick of cinnamon and a tea strainer filled with cloves to give extra zest! I make this every year for Thanksgiving!

I made this once because my sister was supposed to make cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving and forgot the cranberries at my house. Now I'm the only one allowed to make the cranberry sauce.

I think next time I will cut the cinnamon in half as it was a bit to much for me, it's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Other than that my family loved this recipe, even my picky 6 year old.

This is an excellent recipe; easy, quick and delicious!  The only addition I made was add about two tbsp fresh orange zest!  I will definitely make this again!

I have never been a big cranberry sauce fan.  I usually serve it out of tradition, but this one was wonderful!  My family all enjoyed it as well and it was super easy.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh-squeezed orange juice only because I knew I had some in the fridge and didn't want to buy prepared juice.
