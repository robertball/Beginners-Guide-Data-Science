This is for those of you, like Boater, who feel that reusing the marinade is dangerous due to raw chicken factor, in #4 of the directions, it says to 'Boil' the marinade. By boiling it, it Cooks the marinade making it Safe to add the bbq sauce to it to slather on the grilled cooked chicken. I would Never suggest other wise!! I hope this helps those in doubt. Enjoy with my blessing!

This is a winner, winner recipe. The only thing I would change is to use real minced garlic instead of garlic powder...and I would add alot more. The marinade, when boiled and reduced, cooks all the rawness of the chicken and makes it safe for consumption. When you add the BBQ sauce to the thickened marinade, it makes a glaze like sauce that just  bumps up the already yummy grilled chicken to a whole different level. You can change the flavor of the sauce by changing the kind of BBQ sauce you use. I plan on using a spicy BBQ sauce next time, but any BBQ sauce will make it a winner dinner. I can always tell when dinner is a hit...my husband says it is good without me asking and goes for seconds. He thinks using Guiness beer next time is called for...I think any dark beer will work!!!!

All in all not bad i would suggest that noway would you reuse the marinate the raw chicken was in. I hope that was a mistake...i had to grill my chicken a little longer it was just ok and i may try again.

I am happy to be the first to review this new recipe with a glowing reccomendation.
I was staring at a package of BLSL chicken thighs, trying to be inventive when I happened on this recipe.  I used homemade sazon seasoning because all I could find in the stores had MSG and I actually had achiote from the gift exchange, and my SIL's homemade version of Big Daddy's BBQ sauce.  This was a hands down winner and will be made often this grilling season.  Thanks Patty!

This was really good. I had to through them under the broiler because of it storming outside and it still turned out good. Can't wait until I can up them on the grill.

LOVED this and I LOVE the bright orange the sazon adds. The only BBQ sauce I use is Gates (Kansas City brand and the best around in my opinion) and it is orange-y too so that just made it extra special. I'll admit that I went lightly on the sauce during the grilling and I also used skinless thighs but only due to our preference.  The end result was overall excellent flavor that did not overpower the chicken yet you could still gently pick up on the beer and bbq sauce flavor. Love it Patty Cakes and thank you for sharing!

Made this for supper tonight and it was fabulous.  Follows the recipe exactly and scaled down the servings.  Wish I hadn't. Would love more leftovers.  Chicken was tender and sauce was great.  This recipe rocks.  Never had sazon before and wasn't sure I would like.  In a word "awesome". Thanks for a great chicken recipe !!

Found the Sazon at a local Hispanic market and followed this recipe using Corona, also added some minced garlic to the marinade.  I also used a spicy hot bbq sauce --  Boozy Birdy was a hit and we'll be making this again!

I made this exactly as directed - and it was great!  I have to say, this might be the absolute best way to grill chicken.  The skin was nice and crisp, the sauce was great.
