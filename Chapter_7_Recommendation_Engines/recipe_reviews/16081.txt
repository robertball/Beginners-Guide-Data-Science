We made the following changes:
1)We only had a 1/2lb ground beef and 4oz of Velveeta, so we just halved the recipe.  To make up for the missing cheese, we sliced up a bit of regular sharp cheddar.
2)We used rainbow rotini pasta.
3)We added some instant minced onion while we were browning the beef (I always do!).

Even though we halved the recipe, and used a small baking dish, we couldn't see how to layer everything twice.  We ended up just layering the pasta, beef, sauce, then cheese only ONCE.  We were skeptical on how it would taste, but we actually liked it more than we thought we would!  We both agreed we would make it again.  

My husband was the one to take it out of the oven, and he mentioned that as he was scooping it out, it was rather watery on the bottom (I didn't get the chance to look).  I wonder if it was from the sauce.  The ingredients say spaghetti sauce, but the directions say tomato sauce.  If you use spaghetti sauce, I would suggest getting a quality brand - good and thick!

We may add some garlic to the browning beef next time!  Good recipe!  Easy and quick!

I tried....but it was just ok.  I gave it 3 stars because it was so easy...but another reviewer is right...it tastes like Hamburger Helper. (to be honest I found this site because I was tired of eating that stuff).  I am sorry, I won't be trying this again.  Thanks anyway for the post.

My mom made this when we were kids for lunch then I fed it to my kids for lunch, who now feed it to their kids for lunch.  This also makes a great dinner on nights when your looking for something fast and easy.  To make it different and spice it up I use one green pepper diced small, 1 small onion, diced small.  1/2 tsp. of garlic powder,  1/2 tsp. of pepper.  Add green pepper, onion, garlic powder or fresh garlic along with pepper and saute with hamburger till cooked.  Add one jar of homemade or jarred spaghetti sauce.  Simmer sauce with hamburger mixture till ready to use.  Cook macaroni till done.  Drain macaroni, mix half of beef mixture with macaroni in baking dish, top it with cheese of your choice.  Add remaining beef mixture and top it with cheese of your choice.  Serve with warm bread and butter and a green salad.  If you think it's to dry, add more sauce the next time.

This was surprisingly easy.  I call it "Gourmet Hamburger Helper."  My husband asked for seconds!  I used Maverick ground meat and low fat Velveeta.  I think cheddar cheese or any other cheese would work well if you don't like Velveeta.

This is a 5 star recipe, not because it is fancy and impressive, but because it is a tasty, kid-pleasing, quick lunch with only 4 ingredients, all of which are probably on-hand.

This recipe is fine and certainly easy enough if your Girl Scout Troop is going for their Cooking Badge, other than that, I wouldn't bother.

Although the taste only deserves 3 stars, it is sooo easy to make and my daughter thought it was great that it receives 4.  It IS good but nothing special, the velveeta cheese is what makes it different from spaghetti.  I added some chopped green bell pepper, onion and mushrooms (which we sauted first) and that helped give it some "umph." I may make again when I am in a hurry and need a quick meal for my family.

I have a recipe almost the same as this called "Mock Lasagna". I have been making it since kids were little. It is a favorite of theirs. You can use the hamburg or 1 pound italian sausage cooked and crumbled. You can use your own sauce or make the one that comes with the recipe: 1-15oz.can tomato sauce(2 cups), 1/2 tsp. of each, garlic salt, pepper and dried basil. Cook on stovetop together with your meat. About 10-15 min. Use 1 1/2 cups cream style cottage cheese, 1 1/2 cups cubed velveeta and 7- 8 0z. cooked elbow macaroni. Same directions as this, only add cottage cheese in  dollups on top of layers. I have never tried it with ricotta cheese but bet it would be good also. Should have 3 layers ending with the sauce a cheese layer on top. This is the way we enjoy it and why I gave it 5 stars. Thanks Elizabeth!

Not that impressed guys. Disappointing after seeing such great reviews. Followed the recipe, added garlic, onion and mushrooms, but still was missing something?? This would probably be a great meal for kids, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else.

This recipe was great, but since we used Velveeta on the top it made a plastic like surface, so I will substitute shredded for at least the top layer next time.

This recipe was SO good that everyone at my dinner table had seconds.  Not only that, but my boyfriend came over today on his lunch break - WITH HIS BROTHER - to have leftovers for lunch.  However, I did alter things just a tad.  
I used Ched. and Moz. cheeses rather than Velveeta.  I also added Italian Seasonings and onions to the ground beef.  Last, I used 4 cups of Rotelle instead of the Macaroni.  Next time, I think I'll try a little more cheese and a little more sauce though.  But it was FANTASTIC.  A++!

We served this recipe at the men's Mission for 30 people. This recipe had a very creamy texture and smooth delicious taste. I chose spiral pasta and I prepared everything separately the day before, using 2/3 of the velveta cheese in large chunks. The next day, I mixed everything together making sure there was enough sauce to cover the spiral pasta and heated it up in a greased tin throw-a-way turkey pan. I covered it with tin foil and set an extra pan of water below to keep it from drying out. The men came back for seconds! Definitely a large crowd pleaser.

Awesome. It was so easy to make and we couldn't get enough. Instead of only using the cheese slices-I used grated sharp cheddar in the middle layer for a little zing. Excellent.

This recipe has been waiting for a picture since 2000.  It is so easy - perfect for kids and very beginning cooks.  If you don't want to turn your oven on - just zap it in the microwave, everything is cooked you just have to melt the cheese.  Rather than Velveeta I used Kraft processed cheese slices and made it in individual ramekins.  Easy for the kids and hubby to grab and zap.

This was a great start.  I added 1/4 cup corn, 1/4 cup red onion, 2 whole jalapenos not seeded.  I like a pretty good kick, I would seed the jalapenos if serving to guest.  I used ragu chunky garden pasta sauce.  Added a nice sweetness went nice with cheese which also mellowed out the jalapeno.  Tastes like the california casserole I used to have at church lunches.  My version tasted nothing like hamburger helper!  Can't wait to make again!

Great recipe with a few minor changes.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef.  I added onion and garlic while frying the ground turkey.  I then added Italian seasoning.  I used ~ 2 cups of shredded mozzerella with garlic flavoring instead of the velveeta.  I mixed everything together instead of layering.  I added bread crumbs and sprinkled extra mozz. on top.  It is so easy and came out great.  My 2 & 3 year old picky eaters gobbled it up!  It also freezes very well into two smaller pans.

Thank you for this delicious recipe!  My husband enjoyed it so much he had thirds!  I cooked the beef with garlic and onions.  I used an italian sausage flavored spagetti sauce, sprinkled bread crumbs over the meat and topped it with chedd and moz cheese.  LOVED IT!!!

Just made this tonight... It was great !!! I added some italian seasoning to the ground beef. I only had 3 cups of sauce, which was fine.  I used velvetta on the first layer, but a lot less than the recipe called for... and I put shredded cheddar on top.  Very tasty... not too cheesy or saucy... will definitely make again !!! thanks.

I used ground turkey, added onions and garlic while browning the turkey. Used whatever real cheese we have on hand, usually a blend of cheddar, parm, mozzarella... Pretty good. Easy, as others have said.

Recipe was OK.  To make it great, never use processed cheese; not good for you and it lacks the lustre and flavor of regular cheese.  Experiment with Havarti and Gouda as well as different cheddars.  Makes the taste EXPLODE!

Not bad! I was more impressed than the rest of the family (because I know it only has 4 ingredients in it) but, everyone did eat it so it deserves at least 4 stars. I used No-Egg egg noodles (which I love) & shredded cheddar cheese. Also, garlic powder, onion powder & a good quality sauce. I mixed the sauce w/ the meat for one less step. The sauce is what makes or breaks this recipe so use a good chunky one. A 9x13 in. pan is too big so use the next size smaller. I will make again when in a bind for time. Thanks for sharing.

YUCK!
I think processed cheese is a bad choice...def. substitute the
 cheese  to shredded.  Also, noodles got too mushy.
My kids wouldn't eat it, nor my husband and I

This is a pretty good "staple" meal. It's nothing fancy, but my husband, 3-year-old and I all liked it. However, I have a caution for you concerning the Velveeta:  If you can slice 12 ounces of Velveeta thin enough to blanket three layers in a 9X13 pan, you're a lot better with a knife than I am! Even sliced as thinly as I could get them, I didn't have enough slices to make it, so I kind of staggered them between layers. Not enough coverage and, in my opinion, 12 ounces is not enough cheese for this dish anyway.   I'll probably make this again, but I'm definitely going to use shredded Velveeta, and I'll buy more than 12 ounces.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars on account of its easiness and taste.  The sauce was very thick and hearty.  I followed the recipe except...  1. I used whole-wheat rotini pasta (it was all I had) 2. I heated the sauce and melted the Velveeta into it.  I was a little worried about big chunks of Velveeta, which probably wouldn't taste good. 3. I added some garlic and onion to the beef as it was browning. 4. I mixed all the components together and baked in an 8x8 pan (instead of layering it in a larger pan).  Next time I might try ground turkey and adding some veggies.

There was something distinctly unpleasant about the combination of the spaghetti sauce and the processed cheese food in this recipe.  Kids might like it but I can't imagine many adults would.  I will not be making this again.

This recipe could have been really good but it tasted like it was missing something. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really bland. I think it would be much better if you mixed all the ingredients together  instead of layering them and adding more sauce.

Very easy to make and has a lot of flavour too.  Made many adjustments (partly because I misread the directions).  I began boiling the macaroni before I started the rest of the preparation. Added broccoli, red bell pepper, onions and mushrooms for a more hearty dish. Added oregano, basil and pepper to the ground beef for flavour as others suggested.  Shredded mozzerella and cheddar and mixed all the ingredients together rather than layering it before I baked it for 30 min.  Still turned out great.  I gave 4 stars because there's nothing different or special about it.  But, my husband and I still enjoyed it very much.     Thank you for a tasty meal!

Good food for me, great for kids.  I did 3 cups of sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes Italian style which I really liked.  I also am very glad that I used real cheddar cheese.  Will make again.

I thought 4 cups of spaghetti sauce would have been excessive so I used 2 cups one for each layer. 2 layers worked out great with 6 slices of American cheese in between the layers and 6 on the top. Remember the garlic bread as this is something that would go real well together!

This is both simple and satisfying. You can gussy it up any way you like, but as is its great for fussy eaters. Just DON'T use processed predigested artificial cheese-like substance, but real cheese. And DON'T bother to layer it, just mix it all up in the pan and pop it in the oven.

What I liked about this recipe was how easy it was. However, it needed more flavor. More cheese, some spice. I didn't change anything the first time I make it but I will the next time.

I have a picky husband, and he loves this dish! He now asks for it regularly! I like to use fresh cabot cheddar with a shredded mexican blend of cheeses (look in the dairy isle)... they are a little more mild, and help balance the flavor, too much cheddar or mixing different cheddar makes it too salty for my taste! It's a great alternative to spaghetti, and it's great on a cold night! Still good the day after once microwaved!

This is great and economical.  It only cost me around ten dollars to make this meal.  There were only four ingredients and it was so easy to put together.  It makes enough to feed a large crowd.  The only thing I will do is mix some sauce with meat before layering because we love sauce.

Just got through eating this.  It was alright.  I think I will use shredded cheddar or mozzarella next time.  The Velveeta wasn't to my taste.  Kids loved it because it is so basic and kid friendly.

Smiled coming across this - brings back memories; similar to what my husband introduced to me almost 19 years ago (he used spaghetti & homemade sauce and parmesan + cheddar), the year we got married. Quick and easy; sometimes change it by using what is at hand - other sauces (alfredo/mushroom/bechamel) and chicken/tuna/sausages, various pastas and cheeses. Good base recipe when you need a quick meal.

I was not impressed with this meal. Although it was quite easy to prepare, the tastes did not satisfy any one of my family members.  No one ate the entire amount on their plate.  The velvetta cheese was too cheesy.  Maybe cheddar would be better? I don't know, I'm not trying it again to find out.  If you like hamburger help you might like this recipe.  Sorry.

This would be good at the cottage.  Better than Hamburger Helper, but nothing to rave about.  Probably won't make it a home again.

This recipe is OK if you want something you can throw together quickly. And kids are sure to like it. Not the tastiest thing I've ever eaten, though.

Yummy!  (The last reviewer must've been confused, there's no chicken or onions in this.)  I was a bit leary of how it would taste, but it was great-very creamy from the velveta!  Easy, quick, and yummy.  A keeper.

We didn't like this recipe at all.  It sounded really good and the chicken was very tender, but it was too oniony and didn't have a lot of other taste.

This is a perfect dish for a Saturday, when the house is full of kids!
It's quick and easy. All the kids and the husband loved it. Best of all-
they were full and no leftovers. In fact, next time all the kids are
here, I'm going to make a double batch!

I used rotini pasta. I also saute onion with the ground beef. Since I'm not a fan of Velveeta, I use a package of Itialian blend cheese. Combined the beef and onions with marinara or spaghetti sauce,then layered with the rotini and the cheese. Good easy recipe. Thanks!

Simple and good! I make this on an " easy dinner night" I use one whole box elbow noodles, 2 cans/jars sauce and 1.5 lb meat and 1/2 loaf cheese. Everyone loves it. Also remember to line the pan with foil so clean up is easy!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Easy and pretty tasty.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped onions, 1 stalk celery chopped and garlic powder.  Otherwise, followed recipe.  I didn't find it at all dry and it fit my 13 x 19 inch pan just fine. Taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I added onion powder to the meat while browning, used velveeta on the first layer and shredded cheese on the top layer. In additional, I substituted rotini for the macoroni. Covered for the first 20 minutes while baking.  My husband said "I don't know how you made this, but definitely make it again."  We both enjoyed.

This is kid friendly. My 7 year old daughter ate 2 helpings and wanted more the next day. The adults did not care for this. I used the velveta and it did not taste right in this kind of dish. I think mozzerella would be a better choice. I thought the noodles were to soft. I will only make this again if my daughter has friends over for dinner.

I have made versions of this all my life. It's a great base recipe, but if I were to make it for children, I would sneak in some vegetables in the mix and use whole wheat noodles.

This recipe is great for one of those nights you just don't know what to make and you don't have much food in the house.  I thought it was very tasty for a quick meal, I will be making it again!

There was just nothing great about this recipe.  After tasting it I sautéed some mushrooms and onions then added some black olives and tossed in, this did add substance.  Maybe it would be better with Italian Sausage.

Easy to make and tastes great!  I wouldn't recommend processed cheese food, though.  I used a sharp cheddar cheese and it was delicious!

Very good, kid friendly meal. Fed our family of five (2 adults and 3 young children) with little leftovers. It is simple and tasty. However, in the future, I might add something extra such as mushrooms for some additional flavor.

Wow - this was so quick and easy and tasted fantastic.  I added Italian seasoning to the recipe but think it would have been fine without it as well.

Very good!  Although I do suggest adding some Italian seasoning just to spice it up a little...probably good with a little onion powder added too.

My son ate it, I ate it, AND my husband ate it and it's unanimous, we all liked it.
Quick, simple, convenient, and tasty too.
I added this quicky to my recipe box and will make it again.
Oh, I used mozzeralla instead of Velveeta.  Only 8 oz and a generous sprinkling of parmesan on top and it was great.

This is also known in New England as "American Chop Suey" and it usually has diced onions and green peppers.  Also, I usually use shredded cheddar or mozzarella for the topping.

The casserole tasted like spaghetti with an excessive amount of cheese.  It was pretty good, but next time, I would either cut the amount of cheese slices in half, or use shredded cheese.

This was alright.  It just tasted like spaghetti to me.  I probably won't make it again--I'd rather make spaghetti.  It doesn't take as much time and it tastes the same.

Was pretty good.  Next time I will use 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 another type of cheese.  Something to give it alittle "pep".

I hadn't much in the fridge and found this recipe and I had all the ingredients and even added some green pepper and onion to the ground beef for some added flavor and everyone loved it, all 5 of us and there was plenty to go around.  It was really great!

We make this all the time at home.  I stir a pkg of dry spaghetti seasoning into the meat.  It's wonderful with gooet garlic cheese bread and a nice Italian salad.   One of our family favorites.

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and even my picky 4 yr. old son ate a whole plate full, as well as my toddler son.  I added garlic powder to the ground beef.  Since I do not care for processed cheese, I used a shredded cheddar & mozzarella (2 cups) instead, and I added garlic to the beef.  It was great!

This is so simple and easy to make, and really really good! I added garlic to the beef when I browned it (onion would be nice too) and used vegetable tomato sauce... my boyfriend loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

The children loved this tasty combination of their favourite things.  I would add a spoonful of sour cream to cool down their portion just before serving it to them.  They enjoyed the creamy texture.

The first time we made it we liked it but it was a bit bland.  To spice it up when we browned the meat we added a whole sliced onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  We used shredded chedder cheese instead which worked out just as well and we used less sauce.  And for just a bit of flavor and for looks we added round, thinly, sliced green peppers to the top layer under the cheese.  Don't worry about the kids, our ten year old niece loved it!

I thought this recipe could be used with a variety of different cheeses, or even a mixture of two or three different cheeses.  I also thought it needed a little salt.

I made too much, and don't know if I can freeze. I put shredded carrots in with the beef and tricked my son for a little bit. They were still a little crunchy but I liked that. Tastes even better as leftovers.

This is so easy to make and everyone loves it. It’s called Noodle Surprise at my house. Instead of Velveeta we use regular shredded cheese that comes in a bag. So easy for busy nights

Awesome for a casserole to put in the oven for 'delayed' bake on a busy swim lesson evening.  When browning the ground beef I added some chopped onion and bell pepper.  I also cooked the pasta 'al dente' so that the oven wouldn't overcook. I added some garlic bread and a salad - and pleased my large family!

I wish there was another way to describe this dish...other than "gross." The Velveeta didn't melt at all, I felt the 9x13 pan was too big for the amount of ingredients used. But most importantly, I don't think the Velveeta tastes like it even belongs with pasta and marinara sauce. I HATE to waste food but this dish was unappetizing. I think it's just the mixture of the thick Velveeta cheddar cheese, with pasta and marinara sauce; maybe this would be better with Parmesan or mozzarella? Either way, I was highly disappointed and won't be making it again.

I do not like hamburger helper, so I decided to spice it up a little. I used half hamburger and half italian sausage. I also used some spicy seasonings and garlic, it turned out great.

Love this, but I like using shredded pepper jack cheese and small glop of garlic chili paste in the sauce/meat mixture. To taste really... Add a nice little pepper garlicy kick.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my husband and I both liked it very much.  I only had half a pound of hamburger but I did use 2 cups of macaroni so it did make quite a bit.  I shared some with our next-door neighbor.  I plan to make this dish for our next potluck and I'm sure it will be enjoyed.

Good Recipe made with basic ingredients.
I added lots of onion powder and other spices, but other than that, I kept recipe the same.
Thanks again

I was disapointed with this recipe, I didn't realize how much processed cheese was actually in this dish until I was at the grocery store buying all the ingredients.  The dish itself was okay, but too rich for our tastes.

Well, I took the main parts of this recipe and then added my own touch to it.
I used some spices when I ground the beef, I added a lot of shredded cheeses instead of the slice cheese, also I added a can of chedder cheese soup to add a little more sauce to the dish.
I think that with a few added flavors this dish was very good.

9x13 baking dish too large for 1lb of meat.  I would rather use shredded cheese instead of sliced.  Had good flavor but you don't say if the 2 cups of macaroni are cooked or raw.

I have made this several times, and every time my family LOVES it! (VERY picky eaters) The reason this recipe is so great, is the fact that you can fix it SO many different ways by using different types of pastas and cheeses and it is SO quick and easy!  You can make it as spicy or as mild as you please by adding different seasonings etc.  My favorite is by using rotini and mozzarella cheese.  I always add garlic and onion to the ground beef.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

Really quick and easy, this one. Granted, it's not the best on the block, but it does good in a pinch when you've got some hungry people grumbling around you. Velveta does work wonders in the cheese department and gives it this certain smooth texture, but I like to go the extra mile and shred some jack and a pinch of parma ontop. I find that if you've got enough sauce, you can skip cooking the macaroni before hand. It'll give it a little bite, which is a good contrast.

I was really dissapointed with this recipe.  If I make it again I won't use Velveeta cheese.  The taste was just not good but I can see it being a pretty good recipe if used with a different kind of cheese.

My whole family loved this.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add an 8 oz can of mushrooms...but it would have been fine without them.  And it is so fast to prepare.  One hour from start to on the table...and the last half hour it is in the oven so I had time to clean up the cooking mess, fix a salad, and set the table.  It is the perfect week night supper.

I actually loved this recipe as did my very picky 14-year-old son.  I thought it was incredibly easy to make.  I used whole wheat pasta and shredded mozzarella.  It was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks Elizabeth!

This was very good and easy. made it with mozzarella and medium cheddar cheese. Also spiced up the meat before adding it in with the other ingredients. Very good with  seasoned bread crumbs on top.

This recipe is easy to prepare but it needs spicing up. I used marble cheese instead of Velveeta. I also added roasted garlic, pepper, oregano, onion powder and Italian seasoning to the ground beef to give it some taste. I used gnocchi pasta instead of elbow. Next time, I'll cut back on the tomato sauce. All in all, it's a tasty easy meal that simply needs a bit of spice added to it.

Very good, very easy to make! I used rigatoni noodles instead, and I used a basil and garlic spaghetti sauce. I also added mozzarella instead. It tured out a lot like lasagna. I think next time I'll add some green pepper to it, and a different kind of cheese.

I used rotini instead, seasoned up the ground beef and used shredded mild cheddar and colby jack.  Great recipe :)

This is pretty good, I haven't eaten since Sunday. Today is Wednesday. I'm hoping it doesn't hurt me.  I fried the hamburger with onion, and garlic chopped up. Then added some creamy corn to the meat. Layered it as instructed, but put in the meat-corn stuff, then some veggie spirals pasta, then some provolone cheese slices, mozzerella shreds, and sharp cheddar shreds, 2 layers.  Baked, then topped with sprinkle cheese, and red pepper flakes. Thank you

It was OK the first time I made it. Then I substituted a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella for the cheese (probably was more than 12 oz.), added 1 onion chopped up, 1/2 green pepper chopped up, a bit of salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I also seasoned the beef with some garlic powder and Italian seasoning while browning. We served it with parmesean cheese on top. Everyone loves it now.

this was ok but pretty bland. needs more seasonings or something. we had it with a side dish of mashed potatoes which did compliment it but it still needs more seasonings!! really wasn't too thrilled with the turn out. however I didn't use velveeta. I used cheddar cheese and shredded it myself so maybe that was my problem.

Something amazing happened with this recipe - my boyfriend got up and got seconds! I had told him I was making the "ultimate American dish" (I'm in Australia now, and I remember this dish from many a family party). It turned out exactly like how my grandma used to make it. I did make it with shredded sharp Cheddar instead of Velveeta, and used rotini pasta.
I'm having the leftovers for lunch today, and am looking forward to it! Thanks!!!

Very tasty and very easy.  My 16-month-old son even ate it, and he's very picky!

My whole family loved this! My picky 3 year old had several helpings! The first time I made it with moz. chesse b/c I didn't think velveeta sounded good. But I did try it with velveeta and it is good! Thanks for a new family favorite.

This recipe is really good and quick to make. My only suggestion is that I cut the cheese requirement in half because I don't like the cheese to overpower everything else.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't have the exact ingredients (i.e. used broked linguine and american and cheddar cheeses, also added chopped onion) and it was delicious.  Even my very picky three year old daughter asked for seconds.

It was very good! I changed the tomato sauce to a vegetable spagetti sauce, and then added some italian seasonings. Next time I'll try some meat spagetti sauce. My husband and picky brother loved it.

I also made several changes (adding oregano, garlic, cottage cheese, mushrooms) and didn't use velveeta (used mozzarella and cheddar instead).  I  mixed it all together, and it turned out great!  Everyone in our house loved it!

I made some modifications as this was a bit bland for my family. 1/2 Spaghetti sauce & 1/2 red enchilada sauce; when browning ground beef - add black pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, italian seasoning all to taste. My family loved it! Definitely better than hamburger helper!

This was okay. I've been making a version of this for years so it was nothing new. My kids ate a little of it but there will be leftovers. My daughter said she preferred it with mozzarella cheese.

This was great comfort food!! My picky sone ate 2 helpings. I added cottage cheese  as was suggested by another reveiwer and tore the velveeta into small pieces instead of leaving the slices whole for the middle layer. I put cheddar on top. The kids asked if I will make again! I also used ground elk instead of beef and you could not tell at all.

This was ok - if I would have taken more time and doctored up the spaghetti sauce it would be much better.  My 3 year old loved it.  I will make this again, but I will be sure and let my sauce simmer w/spices for a while.

This recipe is very easy and provides a good, filling meal.  A small change I made was to substitute chunky salsa in place of some of the spaghetti sauce.  This provides chopped onions, peppers, garlic, etc.  I think it adds a lot to the flavor, and it is still as easy!

I used to make Hamburger Helper, but now I will just make this - it is sooo easy and sooo yummy.  It makes a lot so you can feed a lot of people with it. Also, I love the all in one dish concept - mix it together, throw it in the oven and eat.  It's really simple.

I love a no pain, no strain, good tasting recipe.  No velveeta in the house so I used shredded mozzarella and sprinkled some grated parmesan on top when it came out of the oven.  DELICIOUS!!!

This is one of the meals you will want to serve when you are short on time. The whole family will devour this one up. I made a double batch and froze one for those late nights when I dont want to cook.

I think that this is the best recipe.  I am a newly wed learning the ins and outs of the kitchen, so needless to say I look for anything that is easy.  This is IT!!  It was delicious.  My husband, (which is very picky) LOVED it.  I will fix it again.  Thanks for sharing..

This dish was delicious and easy. It is just a way of doing something different with
spaghetti. When I feel like doing something different with my spaghetti, I will try
this recipe again. It is truly a good one.

This was very easy and very good.  I didn't find it dull in the very least as some of the prior comments indicated.  If I may, I would like to make a few suggestions: 1)While the ground beef is browning, season with salt, pepper, and some of your favorite  seasonings.  2) Slice the velveta yourself as opposed to buying any pre-sliced cheese.  3) Use a fine quality of spaghetti sauce, (ie: I always go for something imported.  You will pay a little more, but it is well worth it.)  Anyway, this turned out wonderful, my family raved, and it was excellent with garlic bread.

It was a hit!  I made this for the first time last night and everyone loved it!  Especially the kids, who are usually hard to get to try new dishes.  (Even when they DO try them they usually take a tiny taste and then say they don't like it) They loved this!  Thanks!

At first bite the whole family loved it!  For leftovers, the next day, after heating up we stirred in some sour cream.  Delicious!
