Great recipe! This recipe goes great served with sour cream. As a variation and for added flavor, when cooking it, use half water and half borsch (Romanian and maybe Russian stores offer it..., a sour delicate-flavored liquid). If not available, you can add a Tbsp of lemon juice. I grew up making and eating "sarmale".

I love the idea of this and followed the recipe exactly.  To me, I wanted more taste to it--I loved the texture and next time I make it I'll spice it up.

3 of 5 because 3 1/4 cups of rice cooks up to an enormous amount.  Also, it was a bit bland for my likes.  I have had this made by a Bosnian friend before and hers was much more flavorful.  I would not use this particular recipe again.  I still have an enormous bowl full of the stuffing mix after going through a head of cabbage.  I could easily feed 20 people off this amount of food.

Place the head of cabbage in a large pot over high heat and add water to cover. Boil cabbage for 15 minutes, or until it is pliable and soft. Drain and allow to cool completely. Remove the hard outer vein from the leaves. This helps a lot!

I was advised to use parsley instead of parsley root. DONT DO THIS. the taste is to strong. it is very hard to get the rice/meat to stay in the cabbage.
