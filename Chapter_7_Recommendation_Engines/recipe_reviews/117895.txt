Delicious bugers!  I love the kick the red pepper gives these.  I used beer instead of the beef broth.  I've grilled burgers with beer before and it always makes them very juicy. I also cut the chili powder down to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of dried minced onion. These were great topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, & onion on sesame seed rolls.

I cut the chili powder and crushed red pepper back by half only because I was making these for the whole family. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder. The beef broth I used was Campbell's so I really didn't need the extra salt as the broth is salty enough on it's own. I was quite concerned about how wet these patties were. Like REALLY wet. I still formed them as best I could and stuck them on the broiler pan. These turned out really good--quite flavorful though it was really fall-apart-y. I don't know what to do to make them less wet for next time. I think this would make a great base for meatloaf, too. Good flavor but needs something to keep them more together.

My husband and I tried these for dinner tonight and loved the spicy kick that these burgers have! Ours were a little on the dry side, as we had no beer or beef broth to use, but they still came out great. Other than that, we followed the recipe and we will making these burgers again in the future.

We both loved these - 1 tsp chili powder and a little less red pepper flake than it called for. :)

This recipe turned out great! The burgers were so jucy! We did have a little bit of trouble keeping them together so next time I think I'll add an egg. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any Worchestershire sauce so I used A1. I think the Worchestershire would have been even better but it was still good!

There was alot of heat in these burgers which I enjoy, but the amount of chili powder tended to create a less palatable flavor than what I had expected. I recommend reducing the amount of chili powder used and perhaps using fresh chopped onion instead of onion powder for additional flavor.

Made these for our bbq memorial day weekend. Actually turned out awesome! Juicy and everything. Added 1/2C breadcrumbs per some other's advice because it was a bit wet to make patties that would stay on the grill. o/w same recipe.

I thought these were excellent, except that they were too wet. I will add a bit of oats or bread crumbs next time to soak up the extra moisture; they were so moist that we lost some parts of them through the grill grates! Despite that, the flavor was excellent and I'll use this again. Thanks!

Followed the recipe to a tee but added an egg to try and bind them.  Had the same fall a party as another reviewer.  The taste was quite bland.  Left an after taste but at the time wish I had smothered them in bbq sauce.  Will never make again.

We liked these juicy burgers.  Omitted the red pepper flakes as I served them with jalepeno relish from this site.  Added some bread crumbs and followed the rest of the recipe as written.

I like spicy things. That said, there was too much 'heat' on these burgers. I could not really taste the meat, so next time I will cut the spices in half at least. Was going to rate a 3, but I think it has potential after the ingredients are adjusted.

Really, really good. I made this with beer (not beef broth) and marinated the beef for around an hour. Just the right amount of spice.

It was good but I like things spicy so I added a full teaspoon of crushed red pepper and black pepper. Also I used Liene's Red for beer, added an egg to hold the patties together, and served with sharp cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce, and toasted honey wheat buns. Turned out great!

I was a little worried about the amount of liquid being mixed in at first. The meat was very soggy, but after it was cooked it was excellent and very juicy. I didn't have any broth on hand, so I just made some with a few bouillon cubes and omitted the extra salt. The only thing I would change next time is to add a little more pepper. I like my burgers bold and this could use a little more kick!

I used cayenne instead of the flakes, but cut back to a quarter tsp. This is a great recipe for turkey burgers being that they need some help in the flavor and moisture department. I loved these and so did my girls. Thank you!

My boyfriend and I loved these burgers. I used almost 2 lbs of beef so I increased everything else. I also added a little bit of bread crumbs to keep everything together. And I used budweiser beer.

Was in the mood for burgers, but didn't feel like messing with the grill. These burgers were great under the broiler. Came out nice and juicy...not too wet...not too dry. Will use again, Thanks for sharing!

Awesome burgers! I didn't have onion powder, so I eliminated the salt and used onion salt.  they are not hot and no need for real onion!
