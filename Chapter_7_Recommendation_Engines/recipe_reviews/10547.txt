These were not so good.  I substituted Frosted Flakes for the corn flakes, which I assumed would be OK.  My cookies came out very very crumbly (probably didn't roll them into tight enough balls)and they had little flavor.

I thought these had an interesting texture.  I made them for my husband to take to work and he came home with no cookies and many requests for the recipe.

We didn't like these cookies--very bland.  I made them for a couple of children with dairy/egg allergies.  I didn't end up giving them to them.  They were easy to make and turned out fine, but my husband and I thought they were quite flavorless.  And we made them with a bit extra cocoa and some extra sugar.  Even with that, they were not chocolately at all, not sweet (and my husband doesn't like things that are too sweet, but he didn't like these), and pretty flavorless..  There's a faint date flavor with a faint chocolate flavor and the chewiness of the corn flakes was not really appealing to my husband. (They're not crunchy--there's just some bites with a chewiness to them.)  They could use more cocoa, more sugar, some salt?  They aren't even a healthy cookie because of all that shortening.  Big disappointment for our particular taste buds.

I have had these cookies before and they were drizzled with chocolate glaze to give a little more sweetness, very popular in New Zealand that way.  I like them, they have a good tin life.

Somewhat unappealing.  Chewy yes, chocolaty sure, but not really what I'm looking for in a cookie.  The chewy cornflakes threw me off a bit.
