My mom makes these all summer long, so good! she doesn't use garlic, just cherry tomatoes cut in 1/2, or slices of roma's; they get brown & carmalized, like sun dried tomatoes. so great as an appetizer or in pasta, thank you!

These are so good! I sprinkle them with kosher salt and cracked black pepper along with the olive oil and garlic.  They're great all by themselves or tossed with angel hair pasta with fresh basil.

I usually make these over the campfire. I enclose them in a foil pouch with a small hole on top for the steam to escape. Quick and easy with little clean up. I usally use butter instead of olive oil and toss in some seasonings, savory, basil, oregano etc.

I like this recipe, but I prefer using cherry tomatoes and slice them to insert slivers of garlic.  This just makes the tomatoes pop that much more. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely the best way to cook up the summer garden bounty....experiment and use flavored oil, and as some have suggested herbs.  Cool tomatoes and bag in a zip bag,  freeze, and enjoy in the dead of winter....yummmm   make into pasta sauce etc.  Doesnt get any better.

All our tomatoes, mostly Roma and grape came in the last few weeks of the fall.  This became our favorite dish to use them up.  I sometimes toss sliced zucchini or broccoli florets in too.  So simple and delicious.

This was another experience for me of a great recipe being born out of necessity - in this case a need to use some grape tomatoes on the verge of being on their last legs! These are great as written but I couldn't resist adding a variety of fresh minced herbs from my garden - just a small amount.  This was a fresh, different and welcome addition to our dinner plates.

Easy peasy! I tossed my tomatoes in a garlic-infused olive oil, added some sea salt, pepper, basil, and onion/garlic powders to taste. My oven runs hot, so I roasted my tomatoes at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. The last few minutes of roasting, I boiled angel hair pasta, tossed with pesto, and used the tomatoes as a topping. Playing around with spices, you could easily make these to suit a Mexican dish, a Greek dish, a Middle-Eastern dish....

Thanks for this recipe! I've also sauteed grape tomatoes with garlic (lots!) in a skillet with just enough oil to coat the surface and seasonings to taste. Wonderfully earthy late summer flavor. Particularly delish with simple grilled eggplant, fresh basil leaves and a teeny bit of good mozzarella, maybe all piled on the fresh bread -now you're savoring the Bari/Puglia region of Italy!  Pour some wine and enjoy.

I made these to use up some cherry tomatoes from the garden.  My tomatoes were called Super Sweets and they were wonderful as is, but once roasted the sweet flavors became very concentrated and even more delicious.  I made grilled top sirloin sandwiches with provolone cheese on ciabatta rolls and topped them off with these tomatoes.  Wonderful!

just made this tonite. It was very easy. My tomatoes were very ripe because there was a LOT of juice in my pan....I think I will use the tomatos for bruschetta later and on pizza. It made the garlic hunks to die for :)

I thought this was very good.  I know we're supposed to rate the actual recipe but the modifications I made were, I believe, minor.  I coated garden grape tomatoes in olive oil, sprinkled powdered garlic (instead of fresh) and added dried Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste.  I just let it roast till I felt it was done to my liking (about 1/2 hour?) and used it as a topping on gluten free pasta (add olive oil to the pasta after cooking to prevent sticking).  Feta cheese makes a tasty topper.  The beauty of this easy recipe is that you can personalize it to taste using your favorite fresh or dried herbs.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing this useful way to enjoy garden tomatoes!

Excellent! I needed to roast a bunch of roma tomatoes, sliced. I placed them onto a baking sheet. I sprinkle them with rock salt, fresh ground black pepper along with the olive oil and 4 garlic cloves. I also added some fresh basil-just sprinkle. Roasted 450 degree for about 20 minutes. Perfect!

I am not a tomato fan but got a container of these in my Bountiful Baskets and this is the recipe I chose.  I'm giving this 5 stars because I did like it.  So for a non-tomato lover, it was good.  My husband and kids liked it as well.

I thought I had "invented" this one!lol  My back was to the wall one time and in my desperation, I fixed my over-abundance of grape tomatoes exactly this way.  My husband and I were delighted with the result and I felt so virtuous to have created such a healthy option for a pasta sauce. Thank you for putting this one out there for all to enjoy!

I've been making something like this for awhile; I like to cook them for about 40 mins at 400 degrees to really get that 'pop' from the tomatoes.  I also add a bit of fresh herbs and balsamic vinegar.

Made with no mods (other than a touch heavy on the garlic). Tastes fantastic, and brings me back to my grandmothers house :)

I also have been making this for many, many years.  It's a good way to perk up store tomatoes in the winter, and it's excellent for any home-grown tomato!  However, I roast mine at 400 instead of 450...works better for me.  That does mean a little longer cooking time, but that's just more time for them to caramelize and become even more lucious.  This is great with an onion thrown in with them, too.  We use these on pizza, sandwiches, pasta, eggs, grits...you get the idea.  If you roast at a lower temp, the olive oil works great, and trust me, that oil is soooo good!  Don't skip it, it really adds to the dish.

I make this recipe all summer when the tomatoes are fresh and local. I freeze leftovers in a baggie and when I want "that taste of summer" I thaw one out and make some pasta, stir together and sprinkle with some fresh grated parmesan cheese, It's a perfect lunch or side dish. I usually add more garlic but that's just a personal preference.

I could seriously eat these everyday.  I added about 3 times the garlic, but I tend to do that with everything!  Delicious.

Very good and easy, great compliment to so many entrees. I used grape seed oil as suggested by another reviewer and had no smoking up of the oven. Also garnished with toasted pine nuts and basil because I had them on hand. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delish! I use grapeseed oil because it can roast at a higher temperature than EVOO. (I use it for any roasted root vegetable as well.) Also, toss in a bit of dried basil. Can also easily roast on parchment paper instead of foil.

For a twist, I tried something different. Instead of olive oil, I cooked some bacon and used the bacon drippings. OMG! Delicious. But, the original recipe is melt in your mouth good.

Super good and sweet. Used regular tomatoes, the ripest I could find, used garlic powder,  sea salt and cracked pepper and a drizzle of evoo. Served on Turkey Burgers from this site and I believe these sweet, dark and roasted tomatoes made this burger even better.  Thanks!

I have been making a version of this recipe for years. It is a family favorite!
I add cut up shallots and fresh thyme.  The shallots are a delicious addition.
ENJOY!!

Good taste. Husband thought there was too much garlic.  One close would be enough.  A sprinkle of garlic powder might be good too.  However, this does not feed six...it barely fed 3 of us.

Been making these FOREVER - they are a great side dish that's insanely quick ... specially if you use my process while something else is in the oven:  little olive oil in a non-stick saute pan, toss in the garlic and grape tomatoes, swirl around a couple of times while cooking over medium/medium high heat.  Sprinkle with sea salt and grind some black pepper over it while cooking and swirling (to prevent burning).  Toss in some fresh basil snipped small if you are so inspired at the time!

I think the baking time is off on these, it took more than 30 minutes to get the tomatoes to kind of squish down.  The flavor was fantastic.  I did add some fresh basil from my garden about 1/2 way through the baking, very tasty!

This is my new craving! I love to put the warm tomatoes on a fresh slice of french bread with goat cheese. The warmth from the tomatoes melts the goat cheese just slightly and the result is heavan!

Very good.  I might consider adding some other fresh or dried herbs to expand the flavor.  A smidgen of Tarragon will add some natural sweetness to it.  Oregano might be good too.

OMG!  A friend recommended this to me.  I have a ton of Amish Paste tomatoes which I had shared with her.  We cut them in half and cooked them long enough to be almost dry.  Then we ran them thru a sieve which made a nice sauce.  I had mine on pizza crust and she had hers on pasta!  Delicious.  I will be making a lot of this;  I plan to freeze the sauce for later.

I'm on a pretty strict diet so finding this recipe was fantastic! I didn't use any oil at all, just some minced garlic with sea salt and pepper and it was really good.  Will be using this recipe throughout my diet.

Made chicken parmesan and instead of using sauce, I served this over the seasoned Rigatoni I made.  SO delicious, I will be making these for a side dish, pasta sauce etc. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these all summer long as well. Just cherry tomatoes, garlic & olive oil. I was roasting a batch indoors & grilling hamburgers outdoors, when an idea struck... I topped the hamburgers with the roasted tomatoes....fantastic!

This is fantastic! Just when I thought I was going to have to throw out more tomatoes because they were wrinkling. I used jarred minced garlic and cooked 30 minutes. Next time I will try to wait longer, they were awesome.

Great recipe.  So easy.  I throw in a couple of zucchini as well.  Leave the skin in and cut into 1.5 in pieces.  Upped the garlic a glove since I added the zucchini.

This was incredibly easy to make and tastes great all alone.  Will try it with some pasta & on garlic bread, as others have suggested.  I used this recipe almost exactly; the only exception....I used 2 additional garlic cloves.

I was skeptikal about making this considering I dont like cherry tomatoes or anything but roma tomatoes.  Even my italian husband was skeptikal about it being a side dish (I never had tomatos as a side dish, only in a salad)...BUT, it was FANTASTIC.  I got to use up a bunch of cherry tomatoes I plantes in the garden without feeling guilty.  If you like dried tomatoes this is perfect...I also thought about layering them on a panini.  I just pulled a bunch and plan on making them again.

Absolutely delicious!  Used as a topping for pizza and (when I realized I had no tomatoes for our salad), threw a few of those in the salad as well.  We thoroughly enjoyed.  Did top with kosher salt and cracked pepper.  UPDATE:  Just had to pop in and let you know we are obsessed with these gems!  I make them at least once a week, now.  Thrown in pasta salad, tossed onto a sandwich, in homemade pizza.  Simply lovely!

This recipe is SO good! Just had it at dinner. Normally I can't stand tomatoes, but this was delicious. We'll definitely make it again.

I made this recipe and put the tomatoes atop steamed baby spinach.  Absolutely delicious. The tomatoes are sweet and garlicky.

This is my go to Medford now for roasting cherry tomatoes, I had 15 cherry tomato plants this year with an abundance of tomatoes that I share with friends and neighbors and family. I have shared this recipe to many people who have tried it and love it. It’s a simple recipe but the roasting with the olive oil garlic and salt and pepper intensifies the sweetness and flavor of the tomatoes dramatically. I have also added onions both red and white and jalapeños and roasted them along side the tomatoes which come out just as good?

This is amazing! I had a lot of whole tomatoes given to me that I hadn't had a chance to do anything with so I quartered them and added a little more oil and sprinkled Italian seasoning on them. Added to the cooking time to get the texture I wanted. I don't think the extras are going to make it to the freezer.

Awesome recipe, used on toasted No Knead Bread from AR. Made as directed, except I used half a cup of virgin olive oil I also added oregano and thyme after roasting on 250 for 2 hours then roasted an additional 2 hours on 200, stirring every so often to really infuse the seasonings with the oil.

Tomatoes were good, but many of them burned to the foil. Would use more oil next time, and perhaps a glass baking pan.

I have mixed emotions about this recipe.  I made it as written, adding kosher salt & freshly ground pepper.  It was mushier than I expected. Next time I will reduce cooking time so tomatoes retain more firmness.  The taste was good if you like plain cooked tomatoes. There was  nothing special to them.  I served them with swordfish steaks, garlic cilantro rice & sauteed spinach.  I chose the recipe for the color it would add to the plate. It did that!  No one felt strongly either way about the tomatoes.  I will make them again with a shorter cooking time to see if they make a better impression.

This was okay using the aluminum foil, but I think the flavor would have been better just roasting them uncovered.  Would have given them a chance to brown and caramelize which would have enhanced the flavor.  Next time I will try it this way.  Great ingredients and so healthy!

This is a great basic recipe.  After cooking tomatoes and garlic add fresh oregano, rosemary, thyme and basil.  Mix with cooked pasta.  Add balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese to taste.  April

I didn't think home grown tomatoes could taste any better! I left my plum tomotoes whole and roasted them for about 30min. Even the juices that burst out of the tomatoes were yummy. Of note I didn't have garlic so I only sprinkled a bit of dried oregano.

This was easy to make.  I had lots of Grape Tomatoes that I wanted to use up.   This recipe went  well with Basmati Rice, on the side or mixed in.   Next time I may add some fresh herbs.

GREAT EASY. We love these. I love tomatoes . If you 
believe they don't have as much flavor during winter months but still want tomatoes , make recipes like this. When they start to get a little to ripe this is great. Add a few red pepper flakes for extra flavor if needed, also fresh basil and parsley. Serve over mashed potatoes, meatloaf , pasta...no end of things. It's easy, but well worth it

Perfect! Toseed in some dried basil flakes (no fresh around right now) and let the tomatoes and basil marinate in the olive oil in the fridge for about an hour. These tasted awesome. Will probably make a pasta with pesto or make these into a cream sauce later.

This is one of those great "What am I gonna do with this?" recipes. I do this when I have a half a dozen cherry tomato plants going full bore. I look over on the counter and see the basket of them that I picked a few days ago and have been munching on but haven't made a dent in yet. Solution...this recipe.

I use it as an appetizer.  Toasted crostini with homemade ricotta then place some of the roasted tomatoes and garlic on top.  Just heaven!

Excellent and easy. I added a large red onion sliced up just because. Roasted all for 20 min at 475. So good.

Great way to prepare tomatoes and can be added to so many different recipes (chicken, fish, steak, veggie dishes) to change things up. Super to add a little something special to those potluck dishes.

I do this w/Roma's cut in half, the only difference is I slow roast them in a 200* oven until they are done.  So good!

Thanks for the recipe. I used cherry tomatoes and sprinkled a bit of sugar to take down the acidity just a bit. Then served them with some snack sized Italian bruschetta toasts. Delicious.

I have been making this for years after seeing a recipe by Sunny Anderson. This is great when used to make a tomato sauce.  Can use plum tomatoes and it freezes well too.

I omitted the garlic just to avoid garlic breath tonight. :) This was just wonderful. I tossed 1/3 of the tomatoes into a simple salad with some EVOO and red wine vinegar. I'm going to try tossing them with some pasta and tuna for lunch tomorrow. Great recipe - thanks!!

Love it! I only did 2 cups, because I didn't read how many tomatoes I had. But I did put all the rest of ingredients in when mixing it. One night had it over pasta but the next turn it into chicken salad.

I'm torn on this  recipe. The roasted tomatoes were delicious but my entire house was smoked out from the olive oil cooking/burning/smoking at 450. Alas. But amazing with homemade pesto and baked salmon. :)

This is delish! I have made this a few times now, both with and without garlic. I usually use diced large tomatoes, with the pulp removed (the liquid tends to burn very quickly). I usually add some dried basil and oregano to add some flavor. Adding a minced green chili also yielded interesting results. I bake for about 40 mins at 210 degrees C. Love this on a sandwich.

Came out nicely!  A great way to use a lot of tomatoes.  Very easy side dish, too.  However, tomatoes did not pop within a half hour; had to keep them in longer.

We LOVED this the first time, then the second time I added some balsamic vinegar to the mixing bowl letting the tomatoes sit for a few minutes in the mixture.  While the tomatoes were baking, I made a batch of orzo.  When both were done, I mixed them together.  Very delicious, but the next day it was even better when I served it cold as a "salad" side dish.

An easy way to get everything coated with the oil and s&p is to toss it all into a ziploc and shake. I just slice on the cutting board and then toss the tomatoes directly in the bag. This same recipe is great with Brussels sprouts as well. Half them (quarter the big ones) and roast until they're browned and tender. Best sprouts EVER, I've not failed yet at turning sprout haters on to this one successfully. Thyme is awesome on both tomatoes and sprouts. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe..Oregano gives a bit more flavor. when done roasting, a sprinkling of flat leave parsley is just the perfect ending .'Thanks for the recipe.

I make this on my grill, the tomatoes are very forgiving add a little extra OO if they begin to dry out but they will sit at the side of the grill while you pay attention to the meat/chicken/fish.  Try an equal amount of balsamic vinegar to take the tomatoes to the next level.
