This is a MUST!! I took the advise of others and used sour cream instead of mayo, an extra egg, extra pepper for spice, and I carmalized onions to add. I made it for Thanksgiving brunch and it was gone before I could even get a slice! My restaurant-owner family friend raved about it!! USE REAL CRAB!

This recipe is super easy to make and is really good.  You can also substitute the crab & swiss with cooked breakfast sausage & cheddar.

They will always want seconds with this quiche.

This was great!  I am on Weight Watchers and made it using fat-free mayo, low-fat cheese and Egg Beaters and it was still DELICIOUS!  I love that it was so quick and easy to make, too.  Great for during the week.

I promise this is the best crab quiche recipe ever made. you can use 1/2 cup egg product instead of the 2 eggs. I used cream instead of milk for a richer flavor. After mixing everything together I added 3 T dried onion, 1 T flour, 1 t garlic powder, 1 t old bay, and 1 t hot sauce. My parents died over it. I made crab cakes the night before and they said they liked this so much better.

Great recipe! Delicious and very easy to make. I used lowfat (2g fat) mayo and you would never know the difference. Also I added green onion as was suggested previously. This recipe will replace my old seafood quiche recipe which was much fussier to prepare.

This is super easy and tasty.  The kids do not like seafood, so I use diced ham with cheddar for theirs.  It is a good base quiche receipe that can easily be 'morphed' into a family favorite.  Easy to make low fat as well using low fat mayo and eggbeaters.  Good protein source with low carbs!

I have made this twice so far, and have followed the recipe exactly -- including mayo vs. sour cream -- and I have to say I LOVE IT! No "mayo" taste (makes me wonder if others who commented used salad dressing vs. mayo?), and I have to say the imitation crab meat gives it a sweet and slightly robust flavor which I don't think real crab meat could do. Great recipe!

Mmmmm..... that's the best description I can think of. I made this for breakfast in bed for Valentine's Day (served with fresh fruit), and it was perfect. I also used green onion (about 1/4 cup chopped) and besides tasing very good, it makes the quiche look very colorful too. 
The immitation crab works surprisingly well in this... almost a sweet flavor.... and I think this recipie would be a good base for adding other meats as well (that is, substituting ham/bacon/etc for the crab).

My husband and I liked this recipe.  I don't like swiss so I used a mix of mozzarella, parmesean and monterey jack cheeses.  I also added about 10 shakes of hot sauce and some chopped onion.  will probably make again, maybe nest time I'll add some chopped artichokes.

I live in France, and I have to say this is a good quiche recipe!  Delicious!  I made a few changes follwing the advice of others.  1) I added fried onions 2) I used 3 eggs.  It was really wonderful.  Also very versitile, you could add other meats aswell.  It's even better the next day!

Delicious! I used Kraft olive oil mayonnaise and aged swiss cheese. I also added 3 thinly sliced green onions. The quiche had a nice, fluffy consistency and a good balance of flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I used lite mayo, added chopped green onions as well as chopped bell pepper & added an extra egg. I omitted almost all the cheese & used about half a cup of shredded mozzarella, just on top. It would have been just perfect if I had remembered to remove the paper liner from the pie shell. LOL Was able to salvage it by using a huge pancake spatula to remove the egg, peeled the paper back some, cooked the pie shell for a few minutes because the bottom was underdone & then inverting the quiche back into the shell & peeled off the paper. If this hadn't worked, I'd be listing this as one of my cooking tragedies but all's well that ends well. ;o) The only thing I will do different next time (aside from removing the paper liner, of course LOL) is to cut up the crab meat ...I thought it would break down some while cooking but it didn't & the chunks were a little big. Served it w/ a salad w/ vidalia onion vinaigrette & for dessert, grilled fruit (cooked inside in a grill pan) w/ simple syrup. Fabulous summertime meal...despite the stupidity of the cook!

This quiche was awesome and hands-down the biggest hit at my daughter's confirmation brunch!  It had a perfect balance of flavors. I was skeptical about the imitation crab, but it was wonderful in this dish. This is a keeper for our family!

I made this for my lactose intolerent husband, so I left out the milk and cheese and just added a little more mayo and an onion, chopped and sauteed in a little oil. The whole family really enjoyed it and it was great cold the next day for lunch.

This was such an easy recipe to make , I used mozz. instead because that was all I had. I also added cooked minced onions, used a 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo., and toped with sliced tomatoes .  A great brunch meal, or to take to a potluck.

My three boys wanted crab omelets made out of the crab we had just caught. But since that is way too much work for 5, this was the compromise. I used an extra egg and crab, and sour cream instead of mayo. I also threw in some green onion. For seasoning, I used Old Bay (a must for crab). It took a little longer to bake than the recipe said, but it turned out pretty good. I will make it again, and probably tweek it a little more. :o)

I love a recipe that is really tasty and easy to fix. This one is fabulous...one I would not get tired of eating. Regarding kid friendly: I have no kids at home, so I don't know about that. This is one of my very, very favorite recipes!

I had a small 6 oz can of crab and wanted to use it, and this came closest to the amount I had. It is quite tasty, although it overflowed the pie crust. I also needed an extra 10 minutes in the oven to get it firm. I did add chopped green onions, and substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise.

Rather tasty, however, I used a deep dish pie crust and it was barely half full.  Next time I will use the regular depth pie crust pan.

Pretty good.  I would cut down on the mayo or maybe sub sour cream next time.  I thought it had a strong mayo taste.  Still, really good and worth trying.  Liked it alot.

Made 8/22/2008, served with green beans.  The children and I just loved it, and we all 'needed' a second helping!  And it was so quick and easy to make, we'll definitely make it again :o)

This is the first time I made quiche because DH doesn't usually eat this dish, but he had 2 1/2 servings of this one! I don't like quiche that are too eggy tasting; this was just perfect. I used real crab and a Mexican blend of cheeses (I don't like swiss). I also added chopped scallions. This came out of the oven looking so pretty, my DH was impressed! I'm serving this for brunch on Christmas day!! I'll try subbing sour cream next time for the mayo. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe, after a few changes. I used 4 eggs like others had recommended. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I also substituted sour cream for the mayo. I did not have swiss cheese, so I used 1/2 cup each of cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan. I also added 1/2 cup of green onions. I am sure if I would have followed the recipe exactly it would have tasted just as good as mine did. Next time I will use real crab, a dash of hot sauce, and a little old bay.

I loved this recipe, but only gave it 4 stars because of the modifications I felt it needed. With the modifications I give it a 5 star rating. As per several reviewers, I used 3 eggs and substituted low fat sour cream for the mayo which gave it a much more airy, less heavy taste. I also added fresh spinach and mushrooms. We aren't big fans of a lot of swiss cheese in a recipe, so I used a mixture of mild cheddar and monterrey jack cheese. Everyone from my father to my husband down to my 2 year old grandson loved it. Serve it with some seasonal fruit or for hearty fare serve it with some great french onion soup.

I have not made this particular recipe but do make a seafood quiche that is very similar. I put in canned or frozen baby shrimp and also finely chopped green onion and celery. Excellent.

Delicious! I added diced onions which gave it some extra texture. I also added some sliced tomatoes on top which gave it some more color. Lastly, I used the "Basic Flaky Crust" recipe for the crust and that was really good, an easy addition and cheaper than buying a pre-made crust.

Great recipe, and easily modified.  I've made it twice.  The first time with real crab and I would have given it 4 stars.  Last night I made it with spinach, mushrooms and bay shrimp.  I sauteed them with garlic, curry powder, olive oil, and Tabasco.  I also added some sharp Cheddar Cheese and the extra egg.  Awesome!!!  Restaurant quality and sooooo easy.  Will definitely make it again.

Great use of imitation crab. It's a steady favourite in my house. I usually use low fat mayo, since it tastes just as good with reduced calories.

I made this for myself and a friend – served it with steamed green beans and apple slices.  I added ¼ C chopped onion, 2 T of shredded bacon, half a red pepper, diced,  ¼ C reduced fat mayo, and ¼ C light sour cream, only scattered about a half cup of swiss over the top of the quiche, rather than mixing it in.  I think this ‘lightened up’ the recipe considerably.  Also, I baked for 55 min.  Maybe this is toying with the original a bit more than usual, but I have to say that my changes made this an amazing dish. It was a good basic recipe, but the onion and pepper really add some zip.

This was a little sweet for our tastes.  Substituting sour cream for the mayo and adding some green onion might help it. I think the imitation crab has a certain sweetness to it, so would use real crab or at least a combination of real and fake next time.

This is very tasty!!!! I wanted to do something different with the package of imitation crabmeat and I saw this recipe. After reading some of the other suggestions, I also included some green onions and did use lowfat mayo. This one is definitely a keeper!!!!

I have made this basic quiche recipe for years.  It is the best recipe I have found. You can add ham, bacon, chicken and broccoli, whatever- it is excellent!  I am looking forward to trying it with crab.

I hate to be the odd man out on this one and so will take the blame for something going amiss.  I DID use real crab meat and the dish came out tasting too strong and 'fishy'(?) to me. I had added a slight amount of fresh steamed broccoli and maybe the two were not compatable. In the future I might use the quiche recipe itself and add different ingredients, though. Sorry, Debra, it was probably something I did.

This was a great quiche.  My husband is allegic to shellfish so it's great to find recipes with imitation crab.  I changed the swiss cheese to white cheddar and added steamed asparagus and chopped green onion.  Will difinately make this one again.

My husband and I had this for dinner last night with a nice salad.  I made it exactly as the recipe called except I substituted provolone for Swiss b/c I don't like Swiss cheese.  I loved it!  He wasn't as fond of it, but then again, he doesn't really care for imitation crabmeat other than in cold dips/salads.  I do plan on making it again.  I might possibly add some garlic and/or herbs next time to see how it tastes with some more flavors.  Thanks!

I DID use the sour cream instead of the mayo; however, next time, I'm going to use Duke's mayo just to see what it tastes like!  I also added an extra egg.  Instead of milk, I used half 'n' half.  I probably used more than 1.5 cups of Swiss but that stuff is hard to measure!  I also added a T of flour, green onions, 1/2 tsp of Old Bay, a sprinkling of onion powder, and a tsp of garlic powder.  
I then topped it all off with Himalayan salt and black pepper.  There was enough to make two nine inch pies.  It was GREAT!!

I was skeptical about using mayo in a quiche, but I   was wrong. This quiche came out delicious and my husband and kids went back for seconds.
I made 2 changes to the recipe to use what was available.  2 big crab cakes Crumbled for the imitation crab and pepper jack cheese for Swiss. 
My family actually liked that hint of spiciness from the pepper jack cheese.

I will definitely make this again! Like other reviewers I used sour cream instead of mayo and half and half instead of milk. I also used four different cheeses (Swiss, Colby/Jack, Provologne and Mozzarella) because that's what I had left over and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. For the crust I grated some  stale bread, mixed it with melted butter and pressed into dish. Then I sprinkled Parmasean and an Italian 5 cheese blend over the crust and baked it for 10 minutes till browned and melted. Then I added the egg mixture. Yummy!  Even surprised myself how good it was!

I've made this several times since I first found the recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but we both felt like it was missing something. After several tweaks, I've got it right where we want it.  

I follow the basic recipe and I add 3 finely chopped green onions, 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning and 1/2 tsp Lawry's Lemon Pepper. After I pour it into the crust I put a small can of French fried onion rings on the top and bake as directed. Fantastic!

This is my base recipe. I follow it to the letter with these exceptions: I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, flour instead of cornstarch,  REAL jumbo lump crab meat and I add large or medium cooked,  peeled and de-veined shrimp. I also add a little fresh dill to the mix before baking.  I serve it hot and often with a side of pan seared salmon and a mixed green salad. It is VERY rich so a little goes a VERY long way!

So this was my first quiche ever and I must say it was a WINNER!  My husband loved it.  I did make a few alterations based on some of the prior reviews and comments.  I sauteed red onion and garlic, diced up fresh spinach, used 2 eggs plus 1 egg beater; 1/4c olive-oil mayo and 1/4c sour cream instead of all mayo; a mixture of cheeses - cheddar/jack/queso, parmesan/romano and sharp cheddar; and added a T of heavy cream to the milk measurement; for spices I added a bit of Old Bay seasoning along with a little bit more pepper. With these alterations it took about 55 minutes to bake instead of the requisite 40 mins.  Yummy!  I can't wait to make it with other meats such as turkey sausage or ham.

This was okay.  Only 1 of 5 liked it.  Too creamy of a texture for our family I think.  Certainly will try something else instead.

It's a little bland, but I spruce it up with green onions, a little bit of bacon and fresh mushrooms.  
Good base recipe for quiche.

This one's a keeper.  Even my meat-and-potatoes husband will happily eat this quiche for dinner.  Serve along with fruit or salad for a yummy girls' lunch...it could not be any easier to make.

The taste was exceptional for imitation crab meat. I bet it would be even more divine with the real stuff. Maybe some Maryland blue crab? 
Quick and easy to prepare. I did add a couple of shakes of hot sauce to the filling and did not have any swiss so I substituted with provolone and parmesan. A big YUM from hubby and myself! Thanks for the recipe Debra.
