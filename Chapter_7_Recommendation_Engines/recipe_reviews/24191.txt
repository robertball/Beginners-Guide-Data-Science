I made this recipe for a huge reception (1000 people)last weekend and it was a big hit. I got several requests for the recipe. I made a few modifications. 1)I completely omitted the milk. It didn't need it. 2)I added some Rotel Extra Hot tomatoes to add a little kick. 3) I used "mexican blend) cheese instead of Monterey Jack. This is a quick easy recipe that is easy to scale for large crowds.

This is a very tasty and easy to prepare recipe! I have made it several times and everyone always loves it. The first time I made it, I included the evaporated milk per the recipe. The consistency was a little "soupy", so the next time I omitted the milk. Without it, the dip was much easier to scoop up with tortilla chips and I actually think it had more flavor. This is definitely a recipe that has been added to my list of favorites.

WOW, totally awesome recipe.  I doubled the recipe and made it all in the crockpot.  I added 2 cans drained/rinsed black beans, 2 cans of corn, used HOT salsa.  Instead of condensed milk- I added a couple spoonfuls of sour cream and a splash of milk, and used a combo co-jack cheese.  Came out perfect, lots of requests for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is one we make quite often at my place, although with a few changes!  I use cheddar cheese instead of the jack, and half and half cream instead of the evaporated.  Be sure to use hot salsa and let it get nice and bubbley hot in the oven!

One word....AWESOME! This recipe has a great blend of flavors that just get better the more you eat!  I served this with both tortilla chips and flat bread.  In addition, I kicked it up with an additional jalapeno w/ the seeds, a can of diced green chilies, a cup of extra cheese (I used a cheddar-jack blend) and I used hot salsa.  It was just the right amount of heat to warm you up but not make you sweat!  Thanks for such a great recipe I will make this frequently.

The taste is great but I agree with the other reviewers that it needs hot salsa and omit the evaporated milk.

Much better with Pepper Jack cheese instead of the Monterey Jack, and a chunky hot salsa with lots of textures and colors. Remove excess water from spinach by squeezing with paper towels after draining.

Made this dip for a Mexican Theme Dinner.  It was EXCELLENT!

I made a few changes as suggested by past reviewers.  I used hot salsa, a mexican blend of cheeses (shredded/packaged).  I used half of the spinach.  Added an additional 3 oz. of cream cheese and lessened the amount of Evap. Milk to 1/4 c.  

Excellent.  The baking time is more like 25 minutes.

This is an awesome spinach dip.  It was even good before baked, I couldn't stop eating it!  I also left out the evaporated milk. Great recipe.

I'm sorry but this dish just wasn't for me. I had a large bag of spinach to use from Costco so I decided to try this.  Some of the ingredients seemed weird but I decided it had to be good with so many positive reviews. Nope. Maybe it was because I used a 'mexican blend' of cheese, or maybe it was the brand of salsa, or the fresh spinach or maybe all of that combined. Sorry Linda. Glad others enjoyed it.

I have been making this recipe for years and just now was able to log on and rate it. It's always a huge hit. I could eat this by myself for dinner. I use sliced olives rather than chopped. I think the evaporated milk is better than using regular milk and the red wine vinegar is essential to the taste. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

A wonderful combination of flavors!!! Your guests, young and old, will surely enjoy dipping in with their favorite tortilla chips, sourdough bread or fresh veggies. Don't forget to drain the spinach well before adding in.

This dip was a big hit! I used the HOT salsa with not many chunks. I made a couple of changes....only half the package of spinach, and about 1/3 cup of Sriracha HOT chili sauce. Gave it a big extra BANG!

Well this is officially a hit!  People haven't been shy about asking me to bring this to pitch ins.  I use about half pepper jack and half cheddar jack, hot salsa, and I skip the evap milk, adding a couple tablespoons of reg milk if needed.  It depends on whether you use a chunky salsa or more liquid-y type.  I love this dip.

I made this recipe for our Super Bowl party and everyone LOVED it!  My fiancee even asked me to make it again (and he's never particularly enthusiastic about food).  I used the hottest salsa I could find and used a mexican cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack alone and this was delicious.  It was a wonderful blend of zippy, spicy, creamy, and salty-tasted great on tortilla chips, raw veggies, pretty much everything we dunked into it.  I also used reduced and nonfat ingredients where I could to make it healthier and it was still incredibly flavorful.  A hit and one I'll definitely make again!

My favorite spinach dip ever!  Like another reader, I threw it in a crock pot.  Rather than low for 4 hours, I did it in high for a little over 2 hours.  It was perfect!

This is awesome!!!  What a nice change from the old tried and true spinach dip!  I would suggest making sure your cream cheese is diced small so it melts better and you need a bit more than just 15 minutes but all in all...very good!

AWESOME!  This recipe really made our Superbowl fiesta!  I made a few mods: I used 1 jar HOT salsa, 1.5 blocks ff cream cheese, 8 oz block pepper jack cheese (shredded), 1 can artichoke hearts (rinsed & chopped), no olives, no vinegar, and only a splash of evap milk.  I used my mixer to whip this up & then put it in the casserole dish.  I topped with about 1/4 cup fiesta-blend cheese & baked for about 20 minutes (nice & bubbly).  I served it with lowfat blue corn tortilla chips.  Great recipe, thanks!

This dip is absolutly amazing.  Everyone loves it.  I made a few changes.  Instead of olives I used chopped red and green pepper.  I also used pre-shredded mexican mix cheese.  I also only used about half a cup of the evaporated milk.  One word of advice...make sure you have lots of nacho chips on hand because you are guaranteed to run out!

this was great, i served with tortilla chips, but would be great with crackers too. this was more like a spinach dip with a mexican twist than the other way around. if you are not worried about fat or calories, i would add some cheddar cheese too ( i cut the amount of cheese in half and used fat free cream cheese and left out the milk) don't put the milk in till the end, you may not need it.

Delicious but revised as per other reviewers.  Omitted the evaporated milk.  Also omitted the black olives for preference and made the salsa fresh from scratch.  It needs a bit more spice.

This is excellent! I make it all the time for social gatherings and it is always a huge hit.  I made a little change to it.  I omitted the evaporated milk, olives & vinegar, then added about 1 cup of black beans.  I also use a medium-hot salsa and a blend of cheddar, mozzarella & monterey cheeses.  mmmmmm, making it again tonight!

This dip is fantastic.  Every time I make it for a party everyone loves it, especially the guys.  I leave out the black olives because I don't care for them.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I add a can of drained black beans and it is perfect.  I also use hot chipotle salsa which gives it a great kick!

Love this recipe.  Easy, and always a hit!!  You can substitute 1/3rd less fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk and not sacrifice on taste.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a total hit!  I used a black bean & corn salsa (found at Trader Joes) and that brought out such a wonderful taste!  I will definitely be making this again very soon.  Thanks Linda for sharing this recipe!

I served this dip at our annual Christmas open house.  It was a big hit.  I made a few modifications including substituting 1/2cup whipping cream for the evap. milk and used only 12 ounces of medium salsa and also used pepper jack cheese instead of the plain.  I served this in a mini slow cooker and several people asked for the recipe!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was good. You want to use HOT salsa; trust me. I read the reviews and didn't want it to be too spicy (so I used medium), but I should have gone with the hot. It was lacking just a little bit. I also used a small can of evaporated milk.

I am so glad I listened to the reviews that suggested using a spicy salsa. I had some fresh spinach I was trying to use up and this was delicious.

This tasted a whole lot better than it looked!!  It was fabulous!!  I used fresh spinach and added a layer of monterey jack cheese to the top before baking.  Served it with tortilla chips.  Everyone at my daughters birthday party just raved about it!  Good job.  Next time I think I will add a can of black beans though.

I loved this recipe! I cooked it for a church Mexican supper, for which I wanted a new take on chips and dip. For my personal tastes, I give it 5 stars! Tastes fantastic and was very easy to make. However, it was not very pretty, and not much got eaten (people didn't know what it was and couldn't tell what was in it). Every person who tried it asked me for the recipe, though!

This was a great dip. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (personal preference) and used fat-free cream cheese, almond milk, and reduced-fat Mexican blend cheese, and it was absolutely delicious. Served it with a variety of items  - tortilla chips, soft tortillas, and veggies, and it went well with them all. (I also added some Dave's Total Insanity sauce to make it extra spicy.) Will definitely make again.

I wrote this the first time: "Definitely leave the cream out. Too soupy but yummy! I added a white onion and jalapeno pepper. Would make it even spicier next time. Just in time for SB Sunday!" BUT I left it in the frig for a couple of hours and warmed some up for my daughter later in the evening. I must say PERFECT even with the milk! The soupy deal is right after making it. Let it sit and having it warmed was YUM ZUM!!

Wow, this is a  keeper of a recipe!  My bookgroup went crazy for this!  I did change out the salsa for the Rotelle chopped tomatoes and chilies which gave it just the right amount of kick.  Omitted evap milk as well.  I'll never make regular spinich dip again!

I've made this many, many times.  It's so easy, delicious and great for parties.  I always add a clove or two of fresh minced garlic, usually substitute lime juice for the vinegar and if you can find a nice roasted salsa it makes this recipe even better!  I also leave out the olives only because I personally don't like olives but I'm sure it adds nice flavor for those who do.

This dip is a tasty side to go along with my mexican lasagna and baked tortilla's. I changed a few things--reduced to 4 oz of fat free cream cheese and exchanged 1 cup of low fat plain yogurt for the condensed milk, and used fresh spinach.  My family LOVED IT!!! It's a keeper =)

I've made it twice...once exactly as is and then again with my changes.  The first time didn't go over very well.  It was very runny.  But the second time I made it, I left out the evaporated milk and I accidentally forgot the vinegar  and it was creamy and delish!

I used 3 full big spoons of sour cream instead of milk, added can of black beans and jalapenos for kick, some mozzarella on top. Made it twice, first time with fresh spinach, second time with frozen. I enjoyed fresh spinach better. All my friends loved it. Thank u so much for rec.

This to my suprise flew out of the dish!  I made this simply because I love all of the ingredients in it, had them on hand and as a taco dip compliment.  I stuck all of the ingredients in my mini crock pot and warmed it up.....tasty stuff....I used fresh spinach....which I didn't cook, but chopped and I think I saw someone sticking their finger in the dish to get that last little bit.....hmmmm.  Thanks Linda!

I made this dip and everyone loved it! Although it doesn't look very appetizing... its a red/orange/green color. But once you get past the looks, the flavors are awesome! The kids seemed to really like it, they were scraping the dish and requested I make it again. Maybe next time I'll save some cheese and sprinkle it on top and put it under the broiler to brown.

Very good taste. As for the use of evaporated milk, I used 1/2 cup of it and made this one day before a party. The dip thicked in the refrigirator so I added the remaining 1/2 cup evaporated milk and baked it for 15 min before serving. My friends loved it!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers to leave out the spinich and the milk and this stuff was thick enough to cut with a knife so keep the milk in this recipe.  The taste wasn't bad, just unimpressive.  My kids thought it was ok, but I had over half of it left over and with 7 kids-thats a LOT left over.  I seriously doubt I will try this again as the flavors should only compliment the spinich I left out and I cannot imagine it will.  I felt like this was a waste of ingredients, I was expecting more than this delivered.  So sorry.

This is excellent, I have made this about a half a dozen times and have found that you can vary the heat and taste by changing salsa's and try mild, medium and hot salsa's to get it to your liking.

Have to jump on the bandwagon with the other reviews. Had a Mexican Fiesta night at church-it proved to be a little spicy for some of our people with "wimpy" taste buds! Took the leftovers to work the next day, and while not considered "industrial strength" (super hot), it was pleasing to the palette and disappeared quickly! Thanks! Will make again.
Oh by the way, used hot Pace chunky picante sauce and a mixture of colby/jack cheese. Also kicked it up a notch with a dash (or 2, or 3) of cayenne!
Yummers!!!!

This is hard for me to rate.  Although this was good, it was nothing special.  It was actually the first time none of my guests asked for the recipe.  If you don't normally eat this type of thing..go for it! otherwise I wouldn't bother.

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe, but mine never set.  After it came out of the oven it was still runny.  Is it supposed to be that way or more firm?  I would like to try this again because it has received many good reviews.  I'll have to give this one another try, but pay more attention to the recipe because it's possible I made a mistake.

Very good! Served this with our mexican-themed dinner tonight. Mmmm good. There is another recipe out there that is similar to this but I like this version better b/c this one calls for salsa while the other calls for making your own version of "salsa" by using drained tomatoes, onions and chiles. This one didn't seems as runny either and the taste was great. Nice spice to your plain spinach dip and should be a success at any party. Would make this again and plan to pass it onto my mom who is a spinach dip fanatic. Thanks Linda!

OUTSTANDING - everyone loved it. I did however subsitute chopped green chilies for the black olives (I loath black olives) but next time I think I will use them - the flavors are so strong that the black olives would not overpower it (but I will keep the peppers too)

Everyone loved this dip! This will definitely be my signature potluck dish for parties and/or get-togethers. It was so easy to make. The only thing I would change is to make a double-batch! It didn't last very long!

Everyone requested this recipe.  Not the best traveling recipe, though.  It is very liquidy before it cooks up-I will make this one at home from now on!

This was delicious (AND EASY)!! I brought this to a New Years Eve party and I got asked many times for the recipe! It also made a HUGE batch. I baked mine in a 8X9 pan and I was surprised how large the recipe was. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe. (I removed the Olives & Evaporated Milk)

Awesome appie! It's always a hit. I made it once with green olives instead and it was SOO GOOD. Very easy to substitute in this recipe if you are missing ingredients or have a different type of cheese, etc. You can dip almost anything in it... Bread, crackers, veggies (mushrooms are my fav). Enjoy!

I made this last night for game night and we all enjoyed it. I did not add the vinegar or black olives, otherwise made as directed. I did have to bake it for at least 30 minutes and stirred it several times while it was baking (my cream cheese was not soft enough). It was quite soupy but as it sat for awhile it got thicker. We could not stop eating this dip and liked it both thick and soupy. I will be making this again.

I made this in hopes that people would rave over it because it got so many amazing reviews.  I followed the recipe, using tips from the reviewers to omit the evaporated milk, and i also substituted black beans instead of the olives.  I highly agree that evaporated milk is not necessary because it was already soupy enough without it.  The dip was good enough, but no one really raved over it, and not many people touched it.  It kind of had a sour aftertaste to it, and the appearance wasn't too appealing...it looks pink when the salsa and cheese are mixed together.  I've had better spinach dip recipes before, so I think I will stick with them.

I made this dip for a Cinco de Mayo party and ended up leaving with half of it left.  Half of the guests enjoyed it enough to ask for the recipe. I thought it was pretty good, but my taste prefers the traditional spinach dip.

I loved this and the dish was scraped clean at our Mexican potluck luncheon this week. I used fresh spinach, but kept everything else the same. By the time it was cooked through and very bubbly, my cream cheese still wasn't thoroughly melted, but I stirred it a while and it was fine. I cooked the night before, kept in the fridge and it heated up quickly in the microwave at work. I might try it next time in a crock pot.

I gave this a 2 stars based on the oringal recipe. I made this as original which was VERY BLAH (even with HOT Chi-Chi's Salsa)
It became a 3 when I modified it as said by others.I used HOT Salsa I added 1 can of strained black beans, 1 can of corn, and 1 can of rotel. WIth those modifications, it made it taste like a cross between spinach dip and mexican dip, but the 2 really dont go together. 
Be sure to squeeze the water out of your spinach and then pat dry with a paper towel otherwise it could be too soupy. 
I will not be making this again. I feel like it would be better with NO Spinach...so Hence the entire receipe just needs alot of work.

This was good, but not sure if I'd make it again. The only changes I made was to halve the recipe and to not use the evaporated milk per other reviewers suggestions.

I kept the condensed milk in the recipe and just added more shredded cheese to thicken it up. It was a hit! It makes so much more if  you keep the milk. The bowl was empty when the party was over :) Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I forgot that I did add more chili powder, cumin, 1 jalepeno, cayenne powder to taste. I like things very very spice!

Very good recipe. I added half a can of corn kernels and omitted the evaporated milk at other reviewers' suggestions. We also sprinkled it with hot sauce and served with sour cream. Great with lime tortilla chips. Will be making again.

This was very good, but not quite in the outstanding category.  I will probably make again, but cut back some on the cream cheese.

This recipe got rave reviews at my husband's workplace.  I did make a few changes, however.  I cut the salsa back to one cup and I used a hot variety.  I also used a Mexican blend cheese instead of the monterrey jack.  I put this in a crockpot in the morning and sent it to work with my husband.  By mid-morning it was heated through half-devoured!

I liked this, however it was a bit bland.  I just added some of my own ingredients to "kick it up" a bit.  After it came out of the oven, I tasted it [bland] added quite a bit of garlic salt and cayenne pepper [since i used 'mild' salsa].  I'll still use mild salsa and control the 'heat' next time with some Texas Pete hot sauce.  I love the ideas others had of adding black beans.  I will also add lots of garlic next time.  All in all, the kids went crazy over it!!

This is a really good recipe... got rave reviews. Only changes I made: used mixture of monterey jack and cheddar; added cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and oregano; and used only 3/4 cup of evaporated milk. I think more milk than that would've made the dip too soupy. Anyway, I'll definitely make this again.

BIG MISTAKE!! I was unsure if I should try this recipe or not because of the mixed reviews- and I really should have stuck with my gut feeling. I had my boyfriends friends over for a mexican themed dinner yesterday- and this dip tasted horrible- and looked even worse. I'm glad we were all able to laugh it off and that the other dishes I made were really good-- I'm sorry, but I'd have to advise all to stay away from this one.

hi,
this is a great dip - i made it this weekend for a shower and everyone asked for the recipe. i also tweaked it a  bit.  i used 12 ounces of cream cheese, a jar of medium salsa, a can of hot rotel (drained), the spinach (well drained), a jar of marinated artichoke hearts drained and cut into small chunks, the black olives, half a can of carnation milk - i put 2 cups of cheese into the dip.  when it was done i stirred it (i thought the cream cheese would be melted more) maybe needed to cut into smaller pieces - anyway stirred and covered top with another 2 cups of shredded cheese and baked until bubbly. YUMMY - will  make this again and again!!

This was awesome!!  I made it to bring to a party this weekend and it disappeared instantly and I have had numerous requests for the recipe.  I think part of the problem others had with the consistency was that when you thaw and drain frozen spinach, you need to squeeze the spinach thoroughly between several paper towels to get the water out.  I will be using this recipe again and again!  Thanks!!

This is so yummy and so easy!!!!! I used mexican seasoned shredded cheddar for an extra zing and added a few real bacon bits for flavor. It was a hit! it made a large amount of dip but was consumed very quickly.... I will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

This recipe was easy to make but I wasn't too pleased with the outcome. I found it a little soupy and a bit too spinachy. My boyfriend, however, gobbled it down, and claimed it was "a triumph." I will try this again. Thanks!

Everyone at my party loved this recipe, however 2 people asked me if there was seafood in it!?  Next time I will probably omit the vinegar.

Sooo good. I love this dip. I did reduce the amount of spinach to a little more than half (it was all I had), I used medium spiced salsa and I used 1/2 c.evaporated milk. The thickness and flavor was just right for our preference. Will make often.

So easy to make and quite the hit. I added a few sliced jalopeno peppers to spice it up a bit (not spicy on its own) and added 1.5x the cheese.

This recipe is absolutely the best. I do prefer it with hot salsa to give it a nice kick and cut down on the evaporated milk to make it creamier. Great served in a bread bowl. GONE IN NO TIME! MAKE DOUBLE BATCH.

DO MAKE THIS DIP...IT IS VERY GOOD, AND VERY EASY TO MAKE. I'VE MADE IT QUITE A FEW TIMES, AND I'VE CUT DOWN ON THE EV. MILK, BY PUTTING JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT "DIPPY". I CAN EAT THIS 5 TIMES A DAY, IT IS THAT GOOD! I'VE ALSO PERFECTED THE "ZING" BY ADDING A JAR OF "HOT" PACE PICANTE SAUCE....AWESOME!!!!

My kitchen is a construction zone so I made this in a crock pot to take to a party, it was such a hit I was asked to bring it again! I used pepper jack cheese and Rotel. I think it was okay but since it was liked so much I would make it again because it was so easy to throw together and bring along.

Very tasty. The recipe is a little to watery then I'd like. Next time I won't use the milk and will add jalapenos.

So yummy.  Made this with fresh spinach and red onion which I sauteed, neufchatel cheese, Mexican cheese, and a can of Rotel tomatoes.  Left out the evaporated milk and used lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar on the advice of another reviewer.  Also added some chili powder since many reviewers said it was bland without hot salsa.  The neufchatel cheese didn't melt well, but I stirred it up after it baked and it was fine. Perfect for Passover when there's nothing else good to eat!

This recipe turned out better than I had thought it would. I took some of the suggestions and left out the evaporated milk I did however replace it with 1/3 a cup of milk also as per. cumin and chili powder to give it a little more bling.

I made this for a party and got rave reviews!  I, too, made a couple changes,  but only because we try to do things from scratch in my home.  First - we NEVER use canned refried beans (especially since in an hour and a half they can go from dried beans to finished refrieds - pressure cooker).  I subbed 4c fresh for 2 cans.  Also - we make our own taco seasoning found on this site - I put 3-4 tablespoons of it in.  And, I used cheddar and pepper jack.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  It was delicious and we came back from the party with an empty dish!  Kudos Linda!

I have been making this dip for years and it has always been a hit (I do use hot salsa, 4 blend cheese and half&half).  Yesterday I made a triple batch for a party that ended up being cancelled at the last minute.  While the dip freezes well, I didn't want that much in the freezer.  I kept out some (sorry no measurements here although about 1/2 the original recipe)  added to cooked hot pasta and added cubed cooked chicken (a bag of tyson's cooked chunks)  Topped with crushed tortilla chips.  Yummy easy dinner

Just finished making this recipe and it was delicious!  Had to scale it down for 2 people but that was easy enough.  Based on the reviews we really made sure the spinach was dried and did not use the evaporated milk.  We also substituted the olives for a small portion of jalapeños to give a little heat.  Can't wait to make it again...it was so easy and a great dish to serve to guests as an appetizer.

Very good dip. To bring down the calories, I used low-fat cream cheese and processed cheese with jalapenos (basically pepperjack velveeta), and left out the milk as others suggested. The dip had a nice kick to it. The next day, with the leftovers, I added a dollop to scrambled eggs toward the end of the cooking time. That was awesome.

Great alternative to ordinary spinach dip.  I too use a Mexican cheese blend.  Make sure you omit the evaporated milk, it makes the dip too runny.  Also the number of serving is way too large.  I scaled it down to make for a group of seven and ended up having to double the amount I made.

I have yet to make this and not be asked for the recipe. I leave out the condensed milk and olives, add a can of rotel with diced green chiles, add a bit more of cream cheese, and use mexican cheese blend instead of the monterrey Jack. Very good!

Great dip! Very easy to make. I agree with the others - use HOT salsa. Definitely a keeper!

This was missing something... I used medium salsa which next time I will definitely use hot.  But it had no texture- so next time I will either try beans or spicy chicken shredded in it!

Really good dip! Brought it to a party and it went fast! I added peperjack cheese instead of the montery jack for kick and hot salsa! Omitted the milk just from reading some of the other reviews. It's true, the dip did not need it. I made it again for football. Great for any party. I served it with tortilla chips and chopped a few roma tomoatoes and sprinkles some in the middle of the dip. Give it a nice presentation!

This dip is so good! I make it with all ingredients as listed, but instead of baking it I cook it in a crockpot for a few hours... This makes it smooth, creamy, and wonderful! On The Border medium salsa seems to work the best for this, very chunky with just a hint of sweet.

I made this last night for a cook out and everyone loved it.  As others suggested I omitted the milk and added some chopped jalapenos to give it some heat and sprinkled some cheese on top before baking.  This was so good and easy I will definately make again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dip was a big hit! I attended a meetup with over 100 people and we were all to bring "snacks or appetizers". Only few knew who made this. All evening, I kept overhearing how good everyone thought it was! I did make some changes. I omitted the olives and milk. I added a can of Ro-tel Tomatoes with chilis, 1 Tbsp of tabasco, and another 2 cups of cheese. I did use Mexican cheese. I will definitely make again and next time I will use Pepper Jack!

This was a LOT thicker than I was hoping for. Still it was ok. Would try again with hot salsa. Would love to get it to a thinner consistency.

Very yummy and easy to make a lighter version. Just use light cream cheese and 2% cheese-will have to stir after heated to mix up the cheeses but it tastes very good.

This was definitely one of the best dips I've ever had.  I brought it to a party and the whole thing got eaten!  I did omit the powdered milk and I used diced chili peppers instead of the olives.  I'm really happy with the result and will definitely make this dip again and again!

I wanted to take a photo of this, but before I could grab my camera people were digging in.  I thought I would have to just take a picture of the leftovers.  Leftovers, what leftovers!?   With the exception of using low fat cream cheese and fresh salsa, I made this dip exactly as written.  It was a huge hit as a starter to a Mexican themed meal and I will definitely make it again.

I LOVE this dip. My whole family loves it too... it's considered my famous dip now. I also didn't add any evaporated milk but I used nacho flavored shredded cheese instead on monterey jack cheese and it's perfect.

We thought this was a great base recipe that we could play with and make changes to. We used Rotel original instead of salsa to give it a bit more bite which was great. We changed the cheese to colby/jack b/c we had it on hand already, and used regular milk instead of evaporated. We did not add the vinegar at all and used the olives only as a garnish. I will say be sure to dry the spinach thoroughly, I used paper towels to soak up excess moisture, so it isn't too runny. I microwaved it for about 6 minutes instead of baking b/c of lack of time and it turned out perfect! We will definitely be making this again as it was a crowd pleaser for Sunday football games! Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  I give it 4 stars because I did not add any milk to it.  I also sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  It got rave reviews.  I also think that with some added chicken you'd have an awesome filling for enchiladas!

Really great twist on ordinary spinach dip. I added Rotel and sour cream, omitted the milk, as suggested. It was just about the perfect consistency. Served with torilla chips and warm pita triangles.

Very yummy! I always make this in a crockpot instead of actually baking it, and it turns out great. If it starts to get a little dry, just add a little milk. I also add extra garlic to give it some extra kick. This is perfect for any Mexican-themed potluck.

I was so excited to try this recipe after reading so many great reviews, but ended up being disappointed. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't great either. I took some advice from others and added sour cream instead of the condensed milk, and I also added a can of black beans. I baked it for 15 minutes, but I really don't think it was ready after that, because the shredded cheese hadn't melted and it wasn't all that hot. So I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes when we got to our friends' house and it still didn't seem done enough. People were a little afraid of it b/c it didn't look appetizing. Some people liked it, but for the most part, it didn't get eaten. I won't be making this again, I don't think.

This dip didn't look very appetizing before it was cooked, but boy was this yummy!! I left out the vinegar and olives, and put in a can of black beans. After it cooked, my husband tried it and said to put in some corn. It was WONDERFUL. Will be making this again!!

This dip is fantastic.  Not much to look at but hey, IT'S SALSA MIXED WITH SPINACH!  You can't expect that to look too appetizing, but it didn’t look atrocious.  All that matters is that it tastes superb!  Next time might mix in either a can of diced green chilies or jalapenos to kick it up a notch!  Thanks for the recipe!

I though this was very good.  I used Medium Salsa.  My husband requested I use hot the next time I make it for a little extra kick.  It was a hit at our superbowl party though!  I served it with tortilla chips and french bread.

We thought this was just "average", and not worth all the hype given it. Compared with the consistency of so many other dips, I found the 1 cup of evaporated milk to make it too soupy for our liking.  The leftovers did firm up a bit, which made it more appetizing.  Good, but not great.

This recipe was awesome!  I did substitute the salsa with a can of rotel, and i left out the vinegar and olives.   Yum! I will definitely be making this again!

We love this dip! Great way to get my 2 & 4 year olds to eat spinach! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. This time, I added crab and artichoke. YUMMY! Will definitely do that again! And of course, now my kids are eating spinach and artichokes without knowing it 'cause they are smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. I just keep the unbaked mix in a large covered casserole and dish out what we need as we go through busy company filled weekends. It works out great and you can either microwave or bake it. Thanks!

I made this for a party over the weekend and it was delicious! I had some requests for the recipe, which I always take as a good sign. I omitted the black olives (not a huge fan of those) and used a "fiesta blend" of shredded cheese instead of plain jack cheese. It was awesome, if I do say so myself.

I did change the recipe a bit because I felt the original was lacking something. I added black beans, corn and jalapeno's for some kick which made this dip a winner in my book!

This dip was great! The only changes I made were I used shredded Mexican Blend cheese, only 5oz of evaporated milk and I substituted a can of black beans for the olives.  And while it didn't look like a very pretty dish, everyone loved it!

I threw everything into a crockpot and changed the recipe a bit.  I chose a salsa that had corn and beans in it, put the spinach in frozen, no red vinegar, 1/2c. cond. milk, and a whole can of olives, sliced.   3 hours on high - Walla!   EASY and YUMMY

This dip is not pretty as others have said. I saved some cheese to melt on top to make it look better. I omitted the olives and added garlic, cilantro and one jalepeno for some bite. I also used medium salsa as others suggested. This was a good party dip and it made a bunch. Next time I will probably use sour cream instead of the evaported milk. If you can get over the look the it tastes really good!

Excellent! This dish was devoured at a party I took it too! Everyone wanted to know what was in it! A keeper! I did find the cream cheese hard to blend, so make sure it is SUPER softened! Also, I found it took longer than the 12-15 min. indicated. Mine wasn't "bubbly" until after 20 minutes or so.

This recipie was super easy, yummy and got eaten up in a matter of minutes. 2 people asked me for the recipe. I used a shredded nacho cheese blend instead of jack, and low fat cream cheese. I was at an adult party, so nobody was focused on how things look, just how they tasted, and it tasted FATASTIC! I felt like an expert chef! Just make sure the cream cheese really is softend well, or it wont blend right with the other ingredients. Awesome dish!

This was an absolute hit at our Halloween Party. I followed some reviewers tips and used hot salsa and also mixed in a bit of cheddar cheese. Next time I think I will use Medium salsa tho. I also cut it in half and it was still quite a bit. Absolute keeper.. thanks!

Was looking for new "Spinach Dip" and this was good for a change.  I served it cool, and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup plain yogurt insted of evap. milk.  Also stirred in a packet of Ranch dressing mix too.  Will try it this fall warm during the holidays.

This is the best dip I've ever had! You can control how hot this dip is by using either mild or hot salsa.  I made it wrong once and it was not that good. The evaporated milk and red wine vinegar make a world of difference!

Awesome!!  I used 'medium' salsa, but I think I would go with 'hot' next time, as the cheeses really reduced the spice/heat.  I baked for 15 minutes, but found that it was still cold in the middle.  2 minutes in the microwave remedied that!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I use a medium salsa and replaced the olives (Yuck!) with a mix of green/red/yellow bell peppers.  This dip disappears quicker than I can make it.  Thanks much for a great recipe.

Dee-Lish!  This is, by far, one of my favorite spinach dips.  I haven't found one person yet who didn't love this appetizer.  People always ask for a copy of the recipe.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.

I loved this recipe.  A friend made it, and told me she got it from Allrecipes.  I made it at home, and couldn't believe how easy it was.  It's very tasty, and something a little different.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't like this one too much. I think it tasted too "spinichey". I have made other spinich dips (aritchoke/spinich), that are much better than this one. I thought it was too tangy, and I didn't like the way the flavors went together. My husband agreed. I thought it was missing something--could have used a lot of garlic maybe?? Usually, the appetizers I make dissapear, but only half of this went at a super bowl party. I wouldn't make it again.

Excellent!  I used La Victoria brand hot salsa for extra kick.  It has wonderful flavor.  If you enjoy very spicy food, try adding a little Lawry's Seasoned Salt with red pepper.

Very good. I used about half of the milk, left out the olives and added some hot peppers. Definitely should have used hot salsa though. A keeper.

Served this for a family dinner on the weekend and it disappeared before I made it back out of the kitchen to taste it 20 minutes later.  Will definitely make this again.  Used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Delicious but not so pretty.  I suggest sprinkling some of the shredded monterey jack over the top after the dip comes out of the oven.

A BIG hit.  I do recommend that you use hot salsa to give it a little more kick.  It does not look appealing but once you try it, you are hooked.  Also, I suggest the Tositos scoops chips with it and I served it on a hot plate and so it stayed warm.  Many people asked me for the recipe.  A keeper!!!

This is an excellent dip for a casual party, but easy enough to put together just for a family snack.  I've made it several times for an annual party that we have for my husband's law students, and it's always a hit.  
I make the dip as written, and it comes out great.  The recipe doesn't say what kind of salsa to use, but I like Pace hot chunky salsa--blended in with everything else it gives a little spiciness without being too hot even for kids.    Be sure to really sqeeze the spinach to get out the excess moisture.  I noticed some of the reviews saying they were afraid the evaporated milk would make it too soupy, but I haven't had that problem. The canned milk gives the dip creaminess without curdling, and the dip stays soft enough to dip even after it's cooled somewhat when it's sitting out on a table.

I chose this recipe for a Mexican progressive dinner and with about 17 people at the first house, this dip was finished in a flash.  Very easy to make.  Put the spinach, cream cheese, crushed red pepper and salt in a ceramic dish with a top and transported it to the first home.  Added the other ingredients there and baked it.  Absolutely delicious over taco chips.

This is my go-to dip recipe.  I always keep these ingredients in stock because I get numerous requests for it. I keep the spinach and shredded cheese in the freezer in premeasured bags.  I make it in a small crock and it fits perfectly.  I don't change anything to the recipe other than some times I use pepper jack cheese to give the dip a little more kick.

I thought the idea of a Mexican Spinach dip sounded like a great twist on an old standby, but it just didn't work out for us.  The flavor was fine, but the texture from the spinach and tomatoes interacting with the milk and cheese was very unappealing to look at and felt wrong in the mouth.

This is a family favorite and highly requested dip.  I made a few changes.  I use half Pepper Jack Cheese and Monterey Jack Cheese,  about half of the evaporated milk and a splash more Red Wine Vinager.  I also add corn and black beans and my family just gobbles it up!  I will be making this for the World Series tonight!  Go Astros!!!

It sounded good  but was disappointing.  I only had 4 ounces of cream cheese but I had everything else.  It looked good but the ladies did not like it.  I think it needs to be served very warm to hot.  By the time the group got to taste it it had gotten cold.  I personally liked the flavors but I am not sure I would make it again.

I don't even bake this most of the time. I might heat a little to soften the cream cheese to combine everything, portion it out into microwavable containers, and bring to work all week. Still 5/5

Excellent, easy recipe to share! Based on the suggestions in the reviews, I cut the milk down to about 1/3 cup, used hot salsa and used a Mexican blend cheese. I mixed it all together in my small crock pot and put it on high until heated through. It's perfect! Just the right blend of creamy and spicy. We'll be making this again!

This is delicious! I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used 1 block of Monterey Jack and 1 block of pepper jack. I used a jar of hot salsa and a bag of fresh spinach. I omitted the olives and used regular milk instead of evaporated. We served this at a Christmas party we had and everyone raved about it! Really amazing dip!

Things I add for a bit more of a kick: some seasoning from a taco seasoning pack, garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red pepper, the taco or Mexico blend cheese. I also add an extra tablespoon of the red wine vinegar. It's always a hit!

This is easy and delicious. I made 2 changes using only 1/2 of the milk and olives the recipe called for. It got to a nice consistency and I will add the remaining milk into the generous leftovers which thickens as it cooled. My guests all raved about it.

I omitted the olives and evaporated milk. Used Tex mex cheese, and added a can of jalapeños. 

It was really good, but it needed to be baked longer than 15 mins. Closer to 22 mins. Also make sure you serve it piping hot.

I used my bar hands to smush the cream cheese together with all the other ingredients in a large bowl before transferring to my baking dish.  I used an entire 4.25 oz can of chopped black olives, as I could not find a 2.25 oz can.  I squeezed my spinach to make sure the excess moisture was out.  Unlike many other reviewers, I used the entire cup of evaporated milk and did not have any issues with the dip being too runny.  I tasted the dip before baking it and realized it was a little bland for our tastes, so I added some healthy doses of hot sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and cumin.  When all was said and done, I took this to a 4th of July BBQ and received rave reviews from many people.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Linda!

Nice change on the traditional spinach dip recipe. I brought this to work for our Christmas party. Those who enjoy spinach dip, enjoyed this dip; however lets face it, not everyone enjoys spinach.

Instead of salsa, I needed to cut the sodium. So I used 2 cans of diced seasoned tomatoes. One with green pepper, celery, and onion; and the other with basil, garlic, and oregano. That added the flavor without the sodium. And the cream cheese was the reduced fat with chives. It came out fabulous!

The recipes tastes great.  I also left out the milk.  The only thing I didn't like was the way it looked.  Tomatoes and spinach do not make a pretty dish together.

Awesome!! I also added a can of heated refried beans, cayenne pepper, some red pepper flakes, sliced green olives, and a couple drizzles of olive oil. I also used hot pepper cheese instead of the plain monterey jack cheese (we obviously like it spicy!) I think a half cup of evaporated milk is sufficient. This was sooo goood!! Will make again... maybe will add some black beans and corn next time!

Very good. I will not add black olives next time because you couldn't taste them at all and it just wasn't necessary. I will add some taco seasoning next time to give it more flavor. I added very little milk to it and it was perfect.

I needed to use a can of evaporated milk that I accidentally opened when another recipe actually called for sweetened condensed milk - BIG difference! Anyway, I was scouring the internet for a recipe that used it that wasn't soup and wasn't dessert, and found this one.  It was surprisingly good, kind of like a queso-y spinach dip with some Mexican flavor.  You can eat it with tortilla chips or with bread, both are great. This would be a great app for a gatherin, would be easy to double/triple as needed. Honestly, for what it is, I wouldn't change anything; it's nothing fancy, but it's a good tasting, easy throw-down dip with minimal preparation.

I made some changes to this recipe according to what I had on hand when I made it, but it came out great. My husband said it tastes like something from a restaurant. I omitted the black olives and the red wine vinegar. In place of just salsa I used one ten oz. drained can of Rotel tomatoes and about 1/3-1/2 a jar of salsa. And I used Colby Jack cheese instead of Monterey Jack. Topped with grated parmesan. Turned out great!

This dip was 'okay', I added garlic powder, it wasn't addictingly good like other dips I had made...I omitted the milk and added a little sour cream.  It lacked something....wasn't sure what.  Won't be making again.

I love the idea of this dip and we found it to be creamy and decadent but it was so salty!  We're thinking about making this again with diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chilies instead of the salsa to see if that will help.  I didn't even add any salt to this recipe but I did serve with salted tortilla chips.  I omitted the evaporated milk because I didn't want it to be soupy, and was glad I did.  I left out the black olives b/c of DH and used fresh spinach b/c that's what I had on hand (had to cook and stir more than if I was using the frozen spinach). If I can get the salt content reduced, this will be a great, easy entertaining dish.

This is a good choice at a party as long as there are no other competing dips.  Has a lot of flavor and texture.

This is delicious!  My only problem was that I think I put it in too small of a pan and it really did not heat as evenly as I would have liked.  Be sure to put it in a dish with a little extra room in it.  I will definitely make it again!

I served this dip last night to some company I had over. Everyone raved about it and it was gone in no time. I will definitely be serving this in the near future.  I followed other reviewers comments: used hot salsa and omitted the evaporated milk (not needed).  I had some crusty bread that I cut into serving pieces and also served with FritoLay scoops.  Definitely a keeper...

I'm a little torn on this one, wish I could give it 3.5 stars. This was good, I enjoyed it (liked it better with celery stix vs. tortilla chips) I think it could be a crowd pleaser, but I really don't see myself making this again.

this is the dip all my guest love.  To make prep easier especially if you are already using your oven, melt the cream cheese and milk together then add the rest of the ingredients and keep on medium heat until combined and nice a hot then serve in a bowl with chips.

After reading the reviews I was so excited to try this recipe.  I took the advice of others and eliminated the evaporated milk, replaced the salsa with a can of Rotel's.  For the cheese, I used a Mexican blend that had peppers in it, for a little extra kick.  Oh and I didn't add olives (b/c I don't like them!).    The dip seemed a bit bland to me, so I added some Cumin (maybe 1/2 tspn) and that made all the difference.  I heated it all in the microwave then transferred to a crockpot for the evening.  It was a hit at the party!

I followed the recipe, but I used light options like 2% cheese, light cream cheese, and fat free evap. milk. We all really liked it(gone in a flash!!), but I think I will use hot salsa next time. All the other ingredients dilutes the heat of the salsa. I also wonder what this would be like using tomatilla salsa. I might try that some time. I will definitely make this again.

This was great and devoured very quickly.  I did add some chopped, sauteed jalopenos because we like spicy.  Omitted olives due to preference, and evaporated milk due to comments from other reviewers.  As a result, it was pretty thick when it came out of the oven, so I added a couple of spoonfuls of cream.  Will definitely be making this often - thanks!

This dip was fabulous!!! I left out the olives (hate them) and vinegar.  It was super yummy.  I took it to my Bible study group and everyone raved about it.  Had it with Tostitos scoops.

This dip is great.  Easy to throw together.  I added some cooked chicken breast pieces to my dip.  My husband would have never tried it without some meat!  Also, I used cheddar/monterey jack cheese mix.  Everything else was done as stated in the recipe.  Turned out great.  I will probably use more salsa next time.

This was really great dip!! I made this the other day for my hubby & it was excellent! I did however make a few changes. I took another person's advice & skipped the evaporated milk. It didn't need it at all. Then I added a can of green chili's & jalapinos since I like a lot of spiciness! It was delicous! We saved the rest & reheated it the next day & even then it was still awesome!
The only thing is I needed to increase the cooking time because it was hot around the edges but the middle was still a bit cool. Other than that excellent recipe & I think I will make this for my next get together or party! Thanks for the recipe!

I personally thought this had to much spinach.  Kind of overpowered the rest of the flavors.  I will make again just cut back on the spinach next time.

Made this last night,and it was pretty good.  I too found the milk to make it soupy, would lessen it or omit it and try again.  Found I missed some crunch, might add some green onions, or corn and black beans as per others suggestions.  We also kicked it up with Hot Sauce, as the medium salsa just wasn't enough heat.  Had too cook it quite a bit longer also, but it's a great start.  Some tweeking will make it our new favorite! Thanks!

Really good!  Made this for a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used a crockpot rather than baking.  Instead of just salsa I used a can of Rotels and some salsa.  I did not use the evaporated milk but added a little regular milk to thin it up as needed.  I also added more cheese than it called for.  This is a great spin on hot cheese dip.  I will definitely make this again!

This dip is excellent!  There was not a bite left.  I did change it a little, I only added 1/2 cup evap. milk, and I added Monterrey Jalepeno Jack cheese with the medium salsa, and that was plenty of kick for us!

Very good. I made a few changes though. I made it in the crock pot with chicken breasts & used sour cream instead of evaporated milk. We ate it for dinner with homemade tortilla chips.

When I first made this dip we ate it hot as it says to do in the directions, but the next day we ate it cold right out of the fridge and it was a lot better. I also think having it the next day allowed the flavors to blend better. I took advice from other users who cut out the milk, used hot salsa, and used Mexican blended cheese. Because I love things a bit more spicy, I added a few shakes of taco seasoning. Real good stuff!

This was pretty good - but we like hot salsa dip, and was expecting a bit more zing. I used hot salsa and then dumped a bunch of Tapatio in too and that helped to give it some kick and not get disguised by all the milk-based products.

AWESOME! the red wine vinegar was just enough "tanginess" for the recipe.. OMITTED the evap milk, as others sugg.. will definitely take w/ me to my next potluck! thanks for the recipe!

Very good. Did not use the evaporated milk. Salt to taste but be careful not to use too much.

This dip is ok but I just feel it was very bland.  It could have been the salsa I used.  I'll be trying it again with a different salsa but it's a very heavy dip so I don't think I'll be making it often.  We like things to have a little bite so if you're the same I would definitely suggest using HOT salsa.  I used medium and it wasn't nearly hot enough because of all the cheese.  Also, the mixture may seem a little thin before you bake it but no worries, it thickens right up about 5 minutes out of the oven.  Overall, it was just average.  If the different salsa doesn't improve the flavor I doubt I'll be making it again.

Very easy to make, even for this cooking novice! I omitted the evaporated milk and the olives (not a fan) and it still turned out perfect! I have already recommended this recipe to a few others and will be making this again for sure!

I've been making this recipe for over a year now for every Party Function and to entertain company.  It is always a Hit and everyone wants the Recipe.  I've also made it for a Baby Shower at work and a Farewell Party and some of the guys just said "WOW" have you tasted this - Fantastic!! :-)

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great either. I enjoyed the spinach in it. My kids wouldn't touch it and they usually eat anything with salsa.

This has become my signature dish!  I add some cayenne pepper and use colby/monterey jack shredded cheese (because it's usually cheaper and easier to find than monterey jack by itself).  I serve with Snyder's White Corn Tortilla chips.  Simply the best!

This was just ok.  I halved the recipe and used only about 2 T of evaporated milk.  I was expecting something more.  Probably will not make again.

I put this all in a small crockpot. I thought it could have used a bit more cheese and a bit less salsa, but otherwise a pretty good dip.

After reading the rave reviews I was excited to make something different. I always make a new recipe exactly per recipe instructions but w/this recipe it was so runny I had to do something so I doubled the cheese.  I also baked it 20 minutes longer than stated.  Took it to a Thanksgiving gathering and NO ONE liked it.  I was very disappointed and will not make again.

I hate spinach and I hate to cook but made this dip for a work party.  Not only did I love it but all of my coworkers did as well (it was even popular when it was served cold). I used hot salsa, substituted Mexican blend cheese for the Monterey jack and omitted the condensed milk.  All of my coworkers now want the recipe.

I thought this recipe was great.  I made it for my sister's bridal shower and it was scarfed down pretty quickly.  I only used 1 jalapeno pepper instead of the 3 that were called for and thought that it was just spicy enough.

Like other reviewers, I didn't add the milk.  I also cut back half the cream cheese and cheese.  The flavor is still good and since it's a vegetable, should still be more healthy than not!  Was delicious.

I really enjoyed this dip.  I omitted the evaporated milk because a lot of people were saying it came out too soupy.  I added a can of black beans, and that added great substance.  I also used hot salsa which gave it a perfect kick.

Oh my gosh!  This was soooo EASY and sooooo good!  I substituted black beans (as someone had suggested in the reviews) for the black olives to save time and it was fantastic!  I made it for a group that meets at my house every other week and they LOVED it! I WILL make this again!

I served this at my family Christmas get together.  It was gobbled up.  I made it again when I got home from visiting because you can have it in the fridge and heat up a little at a time with some chips as a snack!  Excellent.

I am so happy that I found this recipe! I will make it again and again. It is delicious, and so easy to make! I served it at a party and once everyone tasted it, they couldn't stop eating it - or talking about it! They all went home with a copy of the recipe. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!

Our family did not care for this recipe. I served it at a potluck and it may have been that visually people weren't sure about the ingredients.  It tasted okay... just not a recipe that people asked for after tasting.

When ever we have game night this is always requested.  I vary the "hotness" by the salsa.  Mild to hot for your likness.

This is a great recipe.  I made this for the first time for a family gathering and everyone loved it!  A few peopel wanted the recipe.  Next time, I may add more olives becasue I love salty things, but this is delicious.

This recipe is not all that it is cracked up to be!  I was really excited to make it because most reviewers were crazy about it!  I did add diced jalapenos and corn to add some flavor.  My boyfriend and his friend thought it was ok but we all agreed that adding ground beef and/or black beans would have made it better!  It was edible but I'm not going to make it again!

This recipe pairs up salsa and spinach to create a mouth-pleasing appetizer!  I served this at a cooking party and everyone enjoyed.  (They like it so much that it was gone!)  I added extra spicy salsa to really give it a good kick!

Took this to Bunco and it was a hit.  I had it in a deep dish and baking it for 15 min. was not long enough.  I would really watch for it to "bubble" to gauge how long to cook!  REALLY GOOD!

I'm been making this for years and it's always a hit at gatherings.  I made little tweaks, such as added cumin, putting some cheese on top then sprinkling with smoked paprika.  A couple of months ago, I added cooked breakfast sausage (Jimmy Dean, Hot) and it was phenomenal.

Make sure to use QUALITY  salsa with this; I made the mistake of using a generic, low-end salsa and it took away from an otherwise tasty snack.  Very rich.

This was wonderful.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I omitted the black olives and red wine vinegar.  It's a keeper!

really good!! Could use a little more kick to it. I also used Rotel brand can tomatoes and chiles not salsa I thought the salsa would make it too thin.

Nice dip with tortilla chips. I like it even cold. (would't reheat spinach)
I didn't add the milk and used spicy salsa. Will make it again this way.

Dip is good but could use an extra bit of kick... maybe some additional spices, its a little bland with only salt & pepper.  But overall it wasn't bad at all!  :)

I made this with HOT salsa and Pepper Jack cheese and served with tortilla chips. I thought it was a little too spicy but everyone said they loved it, and it all got eaten - even among many other appetizers brought to the party. Next time I will just use regular Jack cheese. Also, I left out the evaporated milk but the dip seemed to stiffen up too much as it cooled, so next time I will add some (but probably not a whole cup).

This makes a large batch of dip. I thought it was okay, but my friends loved it! I used pepper jack cheese and hot salsa. I will make it again but I might try using whipped cream cheese instead of the block.

This recipe came out pretty good but I felt like it was missing a little something for my taste though.  Everyone else LOVED it as is and as a result the baking dish was scraped clean.  Maybe I will try sprinkling a little taco seasoning in the mixture next time, either way I'll be making this recipe again.

Wonderful flavors! I made this for some friends and they loved it! I can´t get salsa where I live(out of the USA), so I subbed a can of diced tomatoes, half an onion, minced, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic. I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This spinach dip was awesome.  I only used half of the spinach, omitted the olives, and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evaporated milk (that was all I had in the fridge).  It still turned out great.

This dip is outstanding.  Very flavorful and the recipe is great for big groups (many servings).  The last time I made this I added fresh jalapenos from the garden and it added some extra zip!

The flavor was O.K. and it was relatively easy to prepare but it looks absolutely gross. My husband said to close your eyes when you eat it. Won't be making again.

This was a great hit at my last party. Everyone commented on it because it was so much better than the classic spinach dip recipes.  It looked great served with different colored tortilla chips.

Delicious!  I was looking for an alternative to the old Seven Layer Dip stand-by.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk.  Everyone loved it!

This dip was excellent!  I also an 8 oz block of pepper jack cheese shredded and substituted diced bell peppers for the olives.  Brought it to a party and it was a big hit.  Thanks for something different!

This was ok. I used my fresh homemade salsa and I wish I wouldn't have. The salsa tasted much better before I used it in the dip. I may try it again, but I think I might use mayo or sour cream instead of the milk.

I have nicknamed this dip "The SeaGull Dip" because whenever I bring it to a party, the people turn into seagulls and swarm around it!  I serve mine with guacamole Dorito's YUMMY!

I served this Hot Mexican Spinach dip at a wine & Cheese party with a mexican flair, it went off very well. I took pita bread, cut them in wedges, dip fried till crispy and served them on the side.

This was great! I made this a day after I had a wisdom tooth removed and it was so good my sore mouth did not stop me from eating it. Also, I used a brand of salsa that was a little watery. Next time, I will use a thicker salsa so it won't be as runny.

This dip is wonderful!! After reading the reviews, I used the hot salsa. It was not too hot, just right. This dip is a great alternative to the usual queso dip. I had many compliments on this dip at a church Christmas party. I will definatly make this again.

Very good and different dip.  I only added half of the milk and it was perfect.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I baked it in a deep dish glass pie plate and it was easy to scoop out.

It really tasted good but the look is not very appealing, I think that is what kept more people from tasting it. Maybe if I had put in in a bread bowl instead of just the casserole dish I cooked it in.

What a wonderful dip!  This was served at a dinner party, and received rave reviews!  
I made the dip one day and baked it the second day.  I think this definitely helped it not be too runny.  I do believe if I made it again, I would use a SMALL can of evaporated milk.

I poured this into a ceramic serving tray instead of leaving it in the baking dish.  It was much easier for everyone to get too and thickened up nicely.

I made this tonight for a super bowl party. It was very good! Very tasty with just the right amount of spice. It had a nice creamy texture that was easy to dip with peppers and celery, and was simple to throw together without much fuss.A keeper!
