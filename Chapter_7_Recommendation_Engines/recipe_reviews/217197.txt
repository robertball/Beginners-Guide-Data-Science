Delicious! Fast and easy. I substituted cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and used fresh broccoli. Really great.

This was faboulous weeknight meal. I've also made a variation of this recipe with 10 oz of couscous and it worked with the same amount of water/soup.

I think this would be okay as is, but I made a few changes.  Feel free to stop reading now if you're offended by that.  I didn't have much time and I had about 7 leftover cooked chicken thighs, so I skinned them and shredded the meat.  I ended up with WAY more meat than called for.  I dumped the meat in the skillet to heat up and tossed a thawed 16 oz bag of chopped broccoli in on top.  After that was warm, I added the soup (cream of mushroom with garlic) and about 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water.  I'm not EXACTLY sure how much broth, because it was from an open box in the fridge and I just poured until it looked like enough liquid for the amount of food in the pan.  I also tossed about 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning, because some reviewers said this dish is bland.  Finally I stirred in the rice.  We like a lot of rice, so I added an extra half cup.  I tossed the cheese in on top and let everything cook for 5 or 6 minutes.  Magically, I had a meal and lots of it.  I think this dish, with all the changes, is 4 stars.  Even with the seasoning and soup change, it was a little bland.  My hubby added Sriracha sauce to jazz it up.  Hope this helps!

Needs a little seasoning, but it was good.  I used Cream of Chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  I also didn't have the Kraft cheese so I just used some other cheese I had on hand and stirred a little cream cheese into the soup and water.

Very easy, tasty recipe. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and just regular marble cheese.

I made the mistake of using regular rice instead of instant... the rice took forever to cook. Next time I'll definitely use instant.

I used steamed broccoli and added a clove a garlic, salt and pepper to the chicken. Turned out really good. Even the boy agreed. I cooked something very similar, without the can of soup, 2 nights ago. Quick, easy, and tasty. Thumbs up from us.

This was OK.  I used brown rice and cooked it with chicken stock and then stirred it in.  This dish would be much better with fresh steamed broccoli, not frozen as called for.  Indeed a good meal for busy weeknights.

This recipe took me 45 minutes...most likely due to the fact that I missed the "instant rice" part of the ingredients...

It was very easy, very cheap, low amount of ingredients... was a bit bland... added some garlic salt and minced onion... gave it some more flavor...added corn which mixed nicely... servied with garlic bread... went over well with everyone including my picky 4 year old... we are thinking next time we may use alfredo sauce num!

This was pretty ok....I added 2 garlic cloves and a 1/4 of an onion. I also added steamed carrots to add some crunch. If not for us it is a bit mushy and I like a little more firmness in my meals. But overall the flavor was good and was a good way to use up left over brocc. and chicken that I had in the refrig.!

This was an Epic Fail for my family.  They love everything that goes in to it, but mixed together they would not touch it.  We have a rule that you have to try it, and even after a couple of bites they still hated it.

I thought this was kind of bland but I used a generic cream of mushroom soup which may have been the problem.  I will try it again with some spices because it was so simple.

I added in chopped sweet onion with the chicken and replaced the cups of water with chicken stock/broth (whichever I have handy) and it turned out great!  I always also add in extra veggies like cauliflower, carrots and extra broccoli!  Our teenage boys love it and so do we!!!

Very good and so easy.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and fresh mushrooms while sauting the chicken.  The only thing I would have differently would be to let it stand for 10 mins. To thicken up the rice mixture.

I made this over the weekend with a few changes. I used regular white long grain rice that I cooked almost to done and fresh broccoli. This recipe needs a bit of seasoning outside of the can of soup. I don't usually cook with salt but this needs just a dash of salt and pepper to make it great! Hubby loved it though!

This was quick and easy, but as others have stated it was rather bland.  I did add some curry powder and crushed garlic to give it some extra flavor.

Huge Hit w/the "Fam" Doubled this w/one can of mushroom, one cream of chicken...spiced the chicken up a bit w/ salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders...cooked rice separately~ had no instant~ so just used less water. Didn't add any cheeses and yet~~It was Still Delicious~~

The rice should be cooked first before it is added, and this is not a recipe that should be multiplied - it will be plenty for the whole family.

Good basic recipe for a quick weeknight meal.  I added chopped onions and garlic when frying the chicken, used fresh broccoli, chicken broth instead of water and threw in a pinch of thyme along with some salt and pepper.  Hubby approved.

This was good. It does need to more seasoning. As other readers have stated it is rather bland.

This recipe was very bland. There was not enough liquid to heat broccoli, just all around “no”. Would not make again.

I made this last night.  Very quick and easy weeknight supper!   My husband loved it.  The only thing I did different was used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and substituted chicken broth for  the water.   I also steamed the broccoli in the microwave first before adding to other ingredients.   I also added some salt and pepper as it was cooking.   It was a delicious meal !!

Super simple and quick! I added in some garlic salt and the usual seasonings to add some flavor. And used cream of chicken instead. Great, fast meal.

This is a simple and no fuss comfort food recipe.  I had some leftover rice I wanted to use up so I didn't bother using the water.  The dish came out very tasty, perfect for a busy night.

The best part about this dish is it requires so few ingredients that I can make it in a very short period of time, even if I have to run to the grocery store and buy the ingredients first.  The reason I only give it 4 stars is the taste is too bland and somewhat boring.  I started adding my normal seasonings to the chicken while cooking it, such as garlic, onion powder and lemon pepper and to me it is much better that way.  Not bad for a quick meal!

This is super simple and good!
I even ate the leftovers cold the next day and it was still good.
This will definitely be going into my regular rotation!

I did have to add a little more water than the recipe called for in order to get my rice to cook.

Made my usual tweak. Added more seasonings. I added minced onion and Worcestershire sauce. It's a good basic recipe.
