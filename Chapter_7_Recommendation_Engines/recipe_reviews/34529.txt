It was delicious.  But when I first made it, it turned to gel. I had to add another cup of water to thin it out. The cornstarch should be cut in half. When I made it a second time. I used only half the amount of cornstarch the recipe called for and it turned out perfect.  Maybe the recipe has a type-o. Maybe she meant to type 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons.

I made this twice and it is very good. The second time, I made it a day ahead to save time. Mistake! Once I re-heated the sauce, it was very, very thick and it took a lot of additional water to make it barely acceptable. Still very good, but this sauce should not be served that thick. But this was due to user error. In the future, I will have all of the ingredients ready to go and make it just before the ham is ready to come out of the oven.

I used this recipe twice.  It is beautiful!  Word of warning: the first time I cooked it ahead of time (same day of meal) thinking that when I warmed it up for the meal, that it would look and feel the same...wrong! It was lumpy and kind of gross-looking...I didn't add water as others have done because I was afraid to affect the taste.  So I served it lumpy and people still liked it!  The second time I prepared it shortly before the meal and kept it warm on the stove and that worked out perfectly. Delicious sauce!

I thought this recipe was awesome.  I noticed some reviews thought the sauce was too thick, so I reduced the cornstarch to 1Tbls.  I had never had raisin sauce before so I asked my brother-in-law how it was and he said "not thick enough".  Must be a personal thing.  I think I will make it again just as I did tonight

Very very good!  Instead of using water and the brown sugar, I used the juice from the slow cooker ham recipe on this site.  Yummy!!

Loved this recipe!  NOTE:  Read reviews before cooking-- I had to store in a crock pot to prevent lumps because I made it too early.  If I had known it would be so easy make, I'd have started it just before I put the rolls in the oven.

This was tasty and easy to make.  I didn't have any lemon juice or rind, so I used orange juice instead.  I also skipped the mustard.  I wanted it sweet.

Quite good, I didn't have any lemon zest so I just left it out and the whole family enjoyed it. Definitely a change from the usual plain ham.

I used this recipe and we all loved it. My hubby always wants raisin sauce when we have ham and I had never found a good recipe until now. I will definitely use it a gain. I did use a little more brown  sugar and raisins.

This is not a very good sauce, unfortunately.  It's basically brown sugar and mustard.  Sorry.

I took the suggestion of several of the other reviewers and reduced the corn starch to one Tbs. I fresh grated the lemon zest and just grabbed a good pinch out of that which was probably a little more than 1/4 tsp. Other than that I measured the other ingredients as per the written recipe. Just out of personal preference, after the sauce had boiled for a couple minutes I removed it from the heat and use my immersion blender to pulverize the raisins down into a smoother sauce more to my liking. I boiled the sauce for a few more minutes and then it was ready to serve. The consistency of the sauce was perfect. Not too thick and not runny at all. I think the immersion blender may have brought out more of the raisin flavor into the sauce than I wanted, but otherwise I found this sauce to be excellent served with my baked ham. The next time I make it I will probably substitute out 1/4 cup of the raisins for 1/2 cup crushed pineapple or apple sauce.

I used this for a banquet.  I had to make it ahead, so the reviews of it being too gelled when made ahead were helpful.  So, I cut the cornstarch by half.  However, I thought it was too thin after reheating, so I added more corn starch/water slurry and it was great.  So, I think you have to play with the thickness, but the taste is great.  I was also serving a french toast bake on the banquet, and people commented that they liked the raisin sauce - vinegar and all - on the french toast too.

This is very similar to the raisin sauce that my family has always made except we used to add a couple tablespoons of ham drippings also.    It's supposed to be thick, like a gel. The second day we warm it and use it as a spread on ham.

Served it with ham for Easter dinner and all who had it said it was very good. I had to make it the night before and when it was warmed in the microwave it was very thick and looked unappealing until I thinned it out with water. Next time I will thin it out before reheating. I particularly enjoyed the taste the lemon juice added to the sauce.

Followed the original recipe although I halved  the recipe for a smaller group.  Very easy and delicious!  Will make this my go-to sauce for all my ham dinners!

Made exactly as directed. As other reviewers have mentioned, I didn't like the texture of this sauce, it was too gummy from the cornstarch. Also not sweet enough, lacking something else too, maybe cloves and prepared mustard. It has other ingredients that I couldn't taste, such as lemon rind, lemon juice and vinegar, which I found unnecessary in the final product. I think I will stick with my 2 ingredient ham sauce, prepared mustard and brown sugar, and just add some raisins to it.

I exchanged... 1/2 cup orange juice and added 1 cup water   ( 1 1/2 cups total) , 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Mixed all ingredients  in a bowl before adding to pan. Heat low and slow and stir frequently. I Added a bit of water if it got to thick.  Very easy to make. Lemon zest a must:). All in all a great recipe. Juice from the ham can be used to thin sauce and add flavor.  My family loved it. !! My grandmother and mother used to make it on Easter and Christmas.. We loved it.

Perfect!  I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of cornstarch and the final consistency was perfect.  I also used dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup currents instead of raisins.  The lemon zest and lemon juice make all the difference in the taste.  Easy and delicious!

I made it exactly as the original recipe specified except that I didn't have any lemon zest.  I thought the thickness was perfect for a sauce like this.  Like any sauce, it's going to thicken as it cools.  We spooned it on our ham straight out of the pan, so it was quite hot.  If I were to serve it in a bowl at a dinner, it might need to be thinned, but for our needs it's fine.  Next time, I probably won't add the mustard, but I'll try to have some zest on hand.

Made it for my family yesterday for a holiday meal. I added the zest of a whole lemon and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Also doubled the recipe in general, cutting back on the cornstarch, and a large box of raisins. The whole family loved it. Now you must understand the family has a bunch of wonderful and critical cooks, so to give this 5-stars is really something! It wasn't too sweet nor too sour, but they all loved it, including the picky teens. Next time I might add a tough of dark rum just for fun. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
