My husband hates chicken and only eats it because I fix it. He flipped over this, didn't know what it was but loved it. I had no idea what it would be like with all of these ingredients, but wouldn't chance anything.GREAT!!!. Thanks Jiff

I may even use this sauce on other dishes, YUM.  Microwaving the peanut butter 20 sec or so makes it mix much better/easier.

Delicious and makes great spicy thai cold salad the next day.  Just add pasta, coleslaw and peanut sauce to taste.

YUM!!!  This is a new family favorite in my household - kids love the "peanut butter" aspect of the dish, and adults love the sophisticated blend of flavors.  I've served it over thin spaghetti for a "sesame noodles and chicken" dish, and even over lettuce and cucumbers for a lighter meal.  Try this one - you'll like it!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  This might be the best recipe I've gotten from this site.  The marinade is terrific, and would be fine on its own.  I thought the peanut sauce was great, and had no problems with consistency.  It gets a little skim on top if you don't stir for a while, but it goes away once you stir it.  It does make a lot of peanut sauce, though.  I used skim milk because I didn't have cream, and didn't add cilantro because I don't like it.  Serve over fettucini noodles and be happy!

I didn't make the sauce because the ingredients were not on hand, but the marinade was phenomenal. The chicken came out very tender and juicy and with a great flavor.  I added more garlic and a little more cayenne, marinaded about 6 hours...YUM!

This was very good. I followed the recipe as written even though I was only using 3 chicken breasts. I marinated mine for 5 hours and found it to be sufficient. The chicken without the peanut sauce was flavorful on it own. Word to the wise- this is a full flavored sauce- a little goes a long way! A couple of table spoons per plate is more than enough. I served mine with basmati rice but think next time I would serve it with broad egg noodles as the flavor from the rice competed with the peanut sauce.

Maybe I did something wrong... when making the sauce, it almost reached a boil, and then all of the oils completely separated and no amount of whisking would get it back together. I had to tip the pot and use a spoon to spoon out the excess oil that was sitting on top. I also found the end product to taste like a spoonful of peanut butter rather than a nice peanut sauce. If I make this again I will use way more coconut milk and way less peanut butter.

Great recipe- Can skip the oil in the marinade and double to coconut milk in the sauce. Can omit the cream and chicken broth if you double the coconut milk. Yummy served over wild rice

I am only rating the peanut sauce, as I didn't follow the rest of the recipe. I made a few changes based of of preference and dietary restrictions: creamy natural pb, unsweetened LIGHT coconut milk, an extra T of brown sugar (the pb I used didn't have added sugar), almond milk instead of cream, and omitted the stock at the last minute because I liked the consistency the way it was. It was fabulous! I served it over rice, chicken and veggies, and had some leftover. The next night we had leftover rice and I warmed the sauce and served over a salad of romaine and shredded carrot, just like one of our favorite Thai restaurants. Thank you for sharing!

The marinade was excellent.  I used natural PB and did not have a problem working it into the other ingredients.  I actually stir-fried some vegetables with the marinade and it tasted excellent.  Once star off for the sauce - this was a very average peanut sauce.  It was really rich, but the intensity was missing.  I halved the sauce and it still was too much!  There are better peanut sauces out there.  Next time, I will just use the marinade.  I served this with coconut rice, and it was great.

My family loved this and they are very picky eaters!  Even my daughter who hates peanut butter ate it!  I substituted the coconut milk with the lite version and used half & half instead of heavy cream and it turned out great!

I made this for four German friends as I live in Germany. Everyone loved it and I have just sent them all the recipe. I only marinated but did not make the sauce. We had it with a caeser salad which was a great combination for a ladies' supper!

This dish reminds me of a dish I had in St. Marteen at a little bar called Karakter that I absolutely died for.  The consistency of the peanut sauce was not a problem, I expected it to separate during cooking as I've made other high oil content dishes...it will become creamy upon adding the stock and the cream. Keep stirring!! I felt like I could have cut the brown sugar in half...peanut butter is already pretty sweet.  I doubled the garlic and cayenne pepper.  If you want it less tangy, you could definitely reduce the lime juice without sacrificing flavor...but in the end, the sauce makes the dish!  I agree with the fact that the soy sauce in the marinade was a little overpowering...but it was still great.  Definitely use low sodium soy sauce.     I agree that jasmine rice is the perfect compliment.  I'd like to try to cut the calories by using light coconut milk, light peanut butter, and light cream (or milk).

The marinade is terrible.  You don't need the brown sugar, or the vegetable oil and the soy sauce should be cut in half.

In fact, ignore the marinade and use the sauce as the marinade, leaving out the brown sugar and heavy cream.

This recipe was great!  The marinade was super and the sauce was fantastic!!!  I definitely would add more cayenne pepper to the sauce to make it spicier.

I loved this recipe. If I were to make any changes, it would be a little less peanut butter and maybe a little more coconut milk. And add an extra dash of cayenne!

This recipe was better as leftovers.  If I make this again, I won't include peanut butter in the marinate, I will reduce the amount of peanut butter in the sauce and my 13 year old suggested I use boneless chicken thighs instead of the breast meat.  But when I took it to work for lunch the next day the chicken breast was a little more tender than the night it was made.

This was a tasty dish, but the cilantro did not work with it! We will probably make this again, but it will not go in our "top recipe" box.

This recipe was "okay". The family did eat it. But, really, it didn't taste like much more than a chicken breast with peanut butter spread on it. All the preparation time was not worth the result.

I followed the recipe exactly but the sauce was very thick and rich.    Too rich for me.  I was thinking it would be more like Thai peanut sauce and more spicy.

This was absolutely delicious.  It's going in my "keeper" notebook.  I served it with brown rice and broccoli. It would also be great with rice noodles.  If you make small slices in the chicken breasts before you marinate the marinade will really soak into the chicken.

This dish is terrific. My husband is very fussy about eating home food over the weekends. I promised to make him something exciting on a Sunday evening. I was not too sure, how this would turn out to be. To my surprize, my husband raved about this dish for hours. This one is really for keeps. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Highly recommended!

This recipe quite surprised me.  I wasn't sure that the ingredients would go well together, but it sounded like it might be good so I was eager to make it.  I used chicken breasts and boneless, skinless thighs, marinated for several hours and grilled.  Meanwhile, the sauce really had me worried, it thickens alot in 15 mins.  But creams nicely with the addition of the cream and stock.  Tastes yummy, maybe a bit too much peanut butter?

the marinade was great, i'm glad i tried the chicken before i put the sauce on... which brings me to the sauce-- it was HORRIBLE.  very overpowering, heavy... it ruined the whole dish.  i'll use the marinade again, but definitely not the sauce.

I used this recipe for a marinade, and cooked up the chicken with a modified version of the sauce for Amazingly Simple Thai Tofu (also on this site).  The dish got rave reviews from all of my guests!

I cooked this tonight on the "ribbed" side of my 2 burner cast iron griddle. It cooked beautifully and was deemed a keeper by my family.  Next time I'll add more coconut milk.  Love the flavor!

This makes the BEST marinated chicken I have ever had.  I will be using the marinade recipe a lot more in the future.  However, I will NOT be making the sauce.  It was terrible.  I also had problems with the peanut butter seperating about halfway through the cooking time.  So I lowered the temp. and whisked in the cream and broth, and it set back up again.  But it tasted awful.  If I were to advise anyone making it, I would definetly tell them to cut back on the lime juice, it was way too overpowering.  But the marinade ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow!  This is everything I hoped it would be.  The sauce has perfectly balanced flavors, and the quantity allows generous servings.  I flattened my chicken between two layers of plastic wrap, which really makes cleanup easy.  Also marinated it overnight, and that allowed the marinade flavor to get all the way through the meat.  I had difficulty getting the pieces into the bag so they would get marinated all over evenly, although there was plenty of marinade.  Also, the cooking process was lengthy for the meat because I had only a 12" grill pan.  Don't be afraid to be generous with the garlic in the marinade.  When making the sauce I put the heat up higher to start, to get the peanut butter into cooperative shape sooner.  I also substituted unsweetened soy milk for the heavy cream, which worked very well.  This recipe is one of the best I've ever made, & I will definitely do it many times in the future.

The marinade was fabulous!  Made the chicken so tender, flavorful and juicy.  However, we didn't care for the sauce.  For being so labor intensive, it wasn't that great...it was overly peanuty and too think to be called a sauce and I even added some milk to water it down a bit while cooking.  The marinade is a keeper...the sauce not.

This was pretty good and easy to make.  I added extra garlic and I'm glad that I did or else I think that both the marinade and zesty peanut butter sauce would have been too peanut buttery.  I was also impressed how well the sauce pulled together after I added the cream and chicken stock since the oil was starting to pull out of the peanut butter.  I served over Thai rice noodles and green onion with the cilantro.

This recipe was so full of flavor, and very easy to make.  I only used 4 large chicken breast and froze the rest of the peanut sauce for the next meal (which will be very soon).  I will definately use this over and over again. MMMMMMMM Good!!

AMAZING. Comes out great, though I'd make more sauce than suggested since it is delish and I always want more. I'd make it a lot more often, but I find it a little overwhelming to assemble all the ingredients on a regular old night.

This recipe has potential, but I have to agree with another reviewer - the peanut sauce was more like thinned peanut butter, and less like a peanut sauce. It was also too sweet for our palates. I suggest less peanut butter, more chicken stock or coconut milk...and maybe omit the brown sugar, or just add it according to your own personal taste. Jif peanut butter is sweet, so additional sugar is not really necessary.

If you do not use Jif peanut butter (and use a natural or generic peanut butter) you may find the sauce will separate. Jif is known for holding up well in recipes.

The chicken itself had good flavor, it wasn't phenomenal, but it was tasty. I let it marinade overnight and made sure it was cooked just until the pinkness was gone. We had the chicken and sauce over rice, but it would probably be even better with noodles and a good handful of chopped scallions and peanuts. Also, the sauce recipe makes A LOT of sauce, more than enough for our family of 7 with quite a bit left over.

All in all, not a bad recipe, but I think it needs to be tweaked.

This was a hit with my family! They are already looking forward to the next time that I make this recipe. I sent the left over marinade and suace home with my son-in-law who wants to try this with fish. I followed the advice of another and made fettucine with this dish. It was a fabulous addition! Thank you so much for this creative recipe. It was a nice change from the typical chicken dishes that I tend to make. This is a must-try recipe!

I made only the peanut sauce from this recipe because I already had leftover grilled chicken breasts.  I made several changes to the recipe to use what I had on hand:  half fresh lime juice and half bottled, 1 t. ground ginger instead of ginger root, dash of cayenne (my kids don't do spicy), and 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese with garlic in place of heavy cream and minced garlic.  I also used the entire can of coconut milk since I wouldn't have a use for the extra and since some reviewers complained that the sauce was too thick.  The sauce was definitely not too thick this way, but it did have some odd lumps from the cream cheese.  Although we really enjoyed the recipe, I would recommend using the ingredients as directed to give the sauce a fuller flavor.  I had a ton of sauce left over, so I'm hoping it freezes.  I can't wait to try the recipe again, this time using the marinade!

I made this into chicken kebabs rather than keeping the breast whole. It tasted great but the sauce is very rich. Not sure why everyone has problems with thickness. Satay sauce is supposed to be thick! Not something I would make often. Would work well as an appetizer rather than a main because of the richness.

A lot of work with little reward.  The peanut sauce separates out very quickly--you really do have to stand and stir constantly for 15 minutes; even then, the mixture separates out immediately once the stirring stops.  In the end, my husband and I both agreed that this recipe just turned out stomachs.  If you decide to give it a try, I highly recommend getting out all your ingredients first and reviewing the recipe thoroughly--many of the same ingredients are used for both the marinade and the sauce, so try to save yourself double work.

Not a quickly done recipe, but the work was definetly worth it.  My husband and I thought that the leftovers reheated were even more flavorful!

This was pretty tasty. I was pressed for time and only marinated the chicken for about 20 minutes. It would have undoubtedly benefitted from longer marinating time. The peanut sauce was also quite good. I did, however, find it a bit too peanuty even though I really like thai influenced foods. Overall, a good recipe.

This was so easy to make.  I marinaded the chicken overnight.  It was so tender.  And the sauce was delicious.  I didn't add enough cayenne pepper because I was afraid it would be too spicy... next time I'll add alot more, but even so it was still delicious!  I just used plain white rice but I think I will try some of the other ideas mentioned in the reviews.  Definitely try this one!

The marinade portion of this recipe is excellent.  I marinated the chicken for 1 1/2 hours which was adequate.  Very tender and flavorful.  I thought the Peanut Sauce was cloying and seemed too sweet for a savory dish.  The marinade portion however is a keeper.
