Very mild and a bit bland for my taste.  I prefer the flavor of fresh garlic and more cilantro.  I also like salsa with onion for more flavor and texture.  Glad I at least tried it for a change, but not something I would make again.

Try a fresh whole jalepeno (or 2)instead of the pickled. Add 2 whole green onions and a few shakes of crushed red pepper to the blender.  Then you have my salsa! Can eat immediately.

I liked this salsa. I saw it recommended on the site this week and decided to try it. It does kind of have the smell, appearance, and taste of basic restaurant salsa. What I liked most is it is very mild, so it would work fine for kids also. Only change I made was making 1/2 recipe and using canned diced tomatoes. I didn't understand the use the juice with the jalepenos. It didn't say how much, so I added about an unmeasured 1/2 teaspoon. I blended it around medium for about 10 seconds in my Vitamix blender. 1/2 recipe made between 1-11/2 cups.

Easy to make.  My sons loved it.  Couldn't stop eating it.  They said it was as good as our favorite Mexican restaurant's salsa.  So glad I decided to give this a try.

Very mild, and tasty. I would have liked if there was more heat from the jalapenos, but thought that overall the salsa was delicious. This goes great with home-baked chips, or store-bought corn chips, and makes an excellent party salsa.

I  made this exactly as written. It was a little bland. I ended up putting fresh garlic, onion and jalapeno. I also added some cumin. This is a good base and you can customize to your family's taste.

This salsa is the best. I think I'm the only person on earth who loves salsa but dislikes the chunky kind, so this is perfect.

I've made it according to recipe, and it's great that way, but lately I've changed it a bit and love it even more: I use a can of diced tomatoes, a bit more garlic powder than called for here, a fresh, diced jalapeno (sometimes with some of the seeds for more spice), a dash or two of onion powder, a bit more cilantro then called for here, and a squeeze or two of lime juice (when I have some).  PERFECT!
