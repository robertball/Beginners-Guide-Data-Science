2.5.20 First, I used my Le Creuset skillet instead of a cast iron skillet.  The texture and flavor is classic cornbread, REALLY good cornbread.  But whoa, when you bite into one of those blueberries and it pops in your mouth, you know this was a combo made in heaven.  That oil sitting in the skillet inside a 400ºF oven made the house smell like I’d been deep frying, even with the exhaust fan running full power, didn’t like that.  I’d like to say I’ll skip that step the  next time, but that smokin’ hot skillet just sizzles when you pour in the batter, gives you perfect cornbread crust, with absolutely no sticking.  I really think it’s an important step to this recipe’s success, so would  recommend that you don’t skip it.  Have tried cranberries before, but never blueberries in cornbread (this was better), and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s definitely a keeper.
