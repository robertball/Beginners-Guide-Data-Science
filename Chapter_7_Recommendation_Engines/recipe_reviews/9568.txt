This was a great cookie, it had a really great taste and was a cinch to prepare.  I sprinkled mine with red sugar and they were devoured in no time.  One word of caution though, they DO NOT make 96 cookies.  I only got 64 cookies out of my batch.

Homemade taste & looks without the fuss of a rolled dough!  Exactly what I wanted.  This works beautifully.  The dough was perfect-not too sticky or too crumbly. Maybe how you measure the flour makes the difference.  Even hubby says they taste great.

These cookies are so easy to make and there are so many fun ways to decorate them: colored sugar, food coloring, sprinkles, frosting....  They taste great, too!

These wonderful simple cookies were what I call- no fuss and easy to make. I spooned in the flour in my measuring cup, leveled off the flour which resulted in cookies that were not dry. I sliced the cookies 1/2 inch thick which made approximately a 3 inch cookie. 1/4 inch cookies were too thin for my taste.  Dipping the cookie on one side with colored sugar makes for a pretty cookie. These cookies would be a good cookie for kids to make. Next time, I might try using lemon extract.

My husband asked me to make these. I never had heard of them before. So for anyone else out there that doesn't know what they are it's pretty much like a sugar cookie (but you have to wait for them.)

Delicious Cookie, easy to make. Staying nice and moist still a week later. Just didn't get as many as it called for, but I had made mine a little thicker.

Loved, loved, loved this. People are asking for the recipe! I found that I had to really work with the dough to get it to roll into a nice log shape - I had to pretend it was play dough! Don’t worry about handling the dough too much... I thought I would ruin it, but the cookies turned out terrific! And this recipe made a lot for me.

This is just like a recipe I had as a kid.  I brought them to work and everyone raved over them.  They can't wait for me to make them again!
