I got on here one day and just wanted a different recipe to use up some noodles and hamburger. What I ended up was a family favorite. 
I changed the recipe just a little to fit my ingredients I had by using a quart jar of tomato juice (I can my own), 12 ounce bag of noodles instead of 16 oz., and home frozen corn (2c) instead of a can of corn. And so far we've made this three times in a month and everyone loves it. 
thanks again!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was filling, but not too heavy.  Since there are just 2 of us we had leftovers that were just as tasty as the night that it was prepared.  Very easy to prepare just make sure you have a large pan to fit all the ingredients.  I will definetly be fixing this again.

This was just okay for me.  I kept referring back to the recipe to see if I had left something out - it was a bit too dry for our tastes.  I'm really a fan of 1-pot meals so I *wanted* to love it, but it was missing something.  Not sure what.  Maybe next time more spices and a can of tomato sauce.  Sorry.  :-(

absolutely delecious !! happy to find  mexican dish without cheese , scaled  it to 4 servings and made some changes , added 4 cloves of garlic instead, 1 fresh tomato large,  added 1/4 cup of frozen corn+1/4 cup of frozen peas instaed of canned ones , and 1 tbs of hot and spicy taco seasoning, 1 jalapeno  for spice, but didnot add beef , so it was a vegetarians delight.  made the  egg noodles first and then added the prepared mixture  gravy to the cooked noodles .lastly didnot had sour cream so thought of plain yogurt as a substitute. thanks for avery tasty recipe.

Hello!  I am the submitter of this recipe.  Make sure if you brown your hamburger in a skillet that you use a larger stock-pot type of pan to do the rest.  If you try and do all of this in a skillet you will run out of room. It makes a lot!

My dinner guests loved this recipe! Filling but not heavy. We put sour cream and Tostitos on the side. I cut back the noodles to 2/3 of a pkg. and added a little extra water and chili powder. I plan on making this again! Thanks!

I too felt like there was something missing in this recipe.  It was good, but not great.  I wondered if using chorizo sausage might spice it up a bit.

I love this kind of recipe that you can easily alter to your tastes or what you have on hand.  I used frozen corn instead of canned, ommitted the olives and omitted the green onion.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover taco meat.  Since it was already seasoned, I didn't add another taco seasoning pack, but did add about a tsp of cumin, tbs of chili powder, a dash of garlic salt and about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  Some complained that this recipe was too dry.  KEEP ADDING WATER UNTIL YOU COVER THE EGG NOODLES on the final step.  Uncover and reduce if you find it too soupy.  Great recipe, thanks!!

This is a great way to add lots of different veggies to your day in a delicious way. I only changed a couple things- I used frozen corn because canned corn is nasty! I only added 8 oz. of egg noodles which was actually a perfect amount. Many previous reviewers said the recipe made too much food, so this is a way to make it smaller while getting more of everything else on your plate. Really, I wouldn't have wanted more noodles anyway. Additionally, I added 2 cups of water for the noddles to soak up- they really needed it. This was a good meal. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of the worst things i ever made. You'd be better off making the noodles seperate. Kept adding liquid while noodles cooked and when it was finally done the whole dish tasted too starched from cooking the noodles with the dish. Almost through it out. Probobly will throw out the leftovers(which I'm sure there will be plenty)

A few changes - added chopped green chilis instead of green onions and kidney beans instead of chili beans. I used frozen corn instead of canned as that's what I had on hand. Also left out the added salt (taco seasoning is salty enough). Used about half the amount of egg noodles, and added a small (8 oz) can of tomato sauce as the finished product didn't seem saucy enough. Served with shredded cheese along with the sour cream. Very good - will be making this again.

Well I didn't have tomatoes so I threw in a jar of salsa and then to add more liquid I added vegetable juice- it was amazing! I'm glad that I was out of tomatoes... you should try it and tell me what you think!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's definitely a comfort food.   Just be prepared... it's A LOT of food!  We had leftovers for days and still had to throw some of it away. They are eight hefty servings!  Great if you are serving a big family; excessive if it's just the two of you.

This was a great dish to bring together some of my staple pantry ingredients. It makes a lot of food but the leftovers are fantastic the next day.

Not to bad! I added extra taco seasoning, a pinch of curry powder and a teaspoon of jalapenos juice from a jar of jalapenos!  I also let it cook longer than 15 minutes to soak up and blend all the flavors.  I'm sure I'll make this again sometime. Oh, I also had some coitja (sp?) cheese and added about 1/2 cup of that while it was cooking.  You could probably wait and use that as a topping!

I followed this pretty closely with a few changes: 3 cloves of garlic, 1 (15 ounce) can of corn (drained), a large can of black olives (drained and sliced), a can of diced tomatoes, chili beans (undrained), no green onion, 1/3 c. salsa, maybe 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, 12 ounces of egg noodles, and 2 cups of water (to make up for draining some stuff). It was just about perfect! It DID make a lot, so we had it wrapped in tortillas with cheese and veggies the second night and ate it mixed with some other leftovers and ranch dressing for lunch the third day. It was taco-y without being too spicy, my husband and I enjoyed it and our daughter picked out the olives. :) Thanks, Lexi70!

nasty!  I had to keep adding water, seasonings, salsa etc to get the noodles to soak up some moisture and cook.  In the end, it was burning to the bottom of the pot and the noodles were pasty.  What a waste!  Thank goodness for cheese and sour cream.

Was an easy dinner to fix but the taste was just ok. There was not near enough liquid to cook the noodles in. I had to add about 2 cups of water to make it work...

I really liked this dish, but I apparently am the only one.  There are 3 men in my house and they haven't touched it.  Unfortunately for me this recipe made a ton.  Guess I'll go heat up some more now.  *sigh*

this was very very good.  only complaint was it was not juicy enough even though i didn't drain any of the veggies.  also i may try to figure out how to cut it in half because it makes a ton.  that or save it for a pot luck dish.  i served it with shredded cheddar as well as the sour cream.

read all the comments about it missing something so i added a few spoonfuls of jarred sliced jalapenos.. it was just what it needed.. Next time i will cook the noodles alone and just use this to top the noodles.. loved it all done one dish but think the noodles will be too soggy if i reheat this

My husband loved it too.  I bought egg noodles for a change.  Also had some ground beef and no idea what to make.  I love allrecipes.com.  I keyed in my ingredients and this recipe was in the list.  My husband is on a low sodium diet and I was able to use no sodium products I keep on hand including no sodium spices.  After reading one comment that the dish was kinda dry I added a full can of water.  I've already recommended this dish to a couple of friends!

I loved this dish! It combines my two favorite foods- Mexican and egg noodles. Yummy! I did add some black beans, mexicorn, diced tomatoes and water. Next time I'll switch to a stock pot after browning the meat because my large skillet just wasn't big enough. Super tasty! Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

Great recipe,and I just discovered what was missing. I did not drain the chili beans, I added a spoonful of salsa, and a can of tomato paste (6 oz). The tomato paste took it from watery to amazing!I also used two Roma tomatoes instead of canned because it's all I had. Thanks! It's like gourmet hamburger helper!
