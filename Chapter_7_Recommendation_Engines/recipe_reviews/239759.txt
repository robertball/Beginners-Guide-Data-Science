This was wonderfully delicious!! To my disadvantage I neglected to read the recipe through a few times before making it and I was very hungry so I missed the spot where it said to add the cream and chicken later AFTER carmelizing the veggies. Silly me tossed it all in the saucepan and simmered it. It did not thicken but the sauce tasted amazing anyway when cleaned up with garlic bread!! I will make this again but might cut back a bit on the syrup. It was quite sweet but maybe had I carmelized that would not have been the case. I will find out when I make this again VERY soon.

The flavor was excellent but there was too much liquid. I would just use 1 cup of cream or add a thickener next time.
