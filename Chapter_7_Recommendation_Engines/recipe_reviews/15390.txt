I love this recipe because it is quick.  sometimes I substitute a large can (29 oz)of the large cut vegetables for one of the 15 ounce cans and leave out the potatoes.  I also add some spicy Mrs. Dash.

This was a good vegetable soup, for sure.  
Aside from peeling and cubing the potatoes, preparation was superquick!  The next time I make it, I'm going to try the addition of hamburger.

This was great with a few personal changes. I did not add the tomatoes with green chiles, and since I used Libby's brand mixed veggies I didn't have to add potatoes. Easy! And I liked it best when it had only been heated through just to temperature. The flavor of the V8 was retained better that way. 
Thank you for a great idea. This was very good.

I used this recipe for a church fund-raising event.  Very quick and easy to make.  It was a huge success! The only change I made was to add some water.

Easy and delicious. As a vegetarian, I am thrilled to see meat-free vegetable soups that are a family favorite. I added dill and replaced regular potatoes with small red/new potatoes. They took only a couple of minutes to chop so it made for an additional time saver. Finally, I topped with freshly grated parmesan. My meat-loving husband loved it and my toddler enjoyed her very own cooled version as well.

This is the simplest homemade vegetable soup I have ever made!! I didn't tell the kids it had V8 juice in it and they loved it!!  It has become a family favorite and an easy way to get veggies into our diet!  The kids now know it has V8 juice in it - but they love it so much they got over it!!

This hits the spot on a cold wet night! I add some ground turkey to it to make it a bit more hardy and it is wonderful! It also works great for my schedule. Which I don't have that much time and I get home fairly late so I don't want to keep my husband waiting too long.

This is such a great quick & easy soup! Even my picky kids ate it. I used a can of diced potatoes in lieu of fresh (quicker) and I added salt-free spicy seasoning (McCormick). Will definitely make again.

Great basic recipe!! Made changes based on the fact that it was a "I'm not going to the grocery store Sunday". Used what I had on hand to clean out the fridge.
Took a very small piece of country ham, diced very small and put into large cast iron soup pot, saut√©ed for a few minutes and then added the cubed potatoes and half a chopped onion, for about 5 minutes. Added only 24 oz of V8 and a cup of water for a thicker soup. Thawed a bag of frozen mixed veggies, added to pot, along with a 14.5 can of fire roasted tomatoes, Mrs. Dash, Lemon Pepper, and just a pinch of salt. Cooked for 25 minutes, than added 2 cans of drained navy beans (only beans I had) during last 5 minutes, so beans would not get mushey.
Served with super thin slices of baked garlic bread.
My husband and I both LOVED it...it's a keeper...hope I can remember what I did for next time.
Thanks for the recipe!

I used low sodium V-8, added a bay leaf and hot sauce to taste.
