I'm torn w/how to rate this recipe.  As written, it would be inedible, due to extreme saltiness.  I used about 1/2 lb of shrimp, and adjusted the salt/powder to 1 TBSP each, knowing it was still going to be too much, and it was.  I cannot imagine this as written.  That being said, assuming a typo and that it should be TEASPOONS, not TABLEspoons, this is excellent!  I served it over pasta and it truly would have been inedible (because of the salt) had I not.  If these were typos and the recipe is edited, I'll happily adjust my rating.

As the other reviewers, by using teaspoons instead of tablespoons, this recipe is Awesome.

I left the salt and garlic powder out entirely.  I use two tablespoons of minced garlic and have served it many times with rave reviews.

Added white wine to sauté and used frozen shrimp because that’s what I had on hand. Tossed  with angel hair pasta. As far as the amount of seasoning I used, I just added in what I would normally and the dish tasted great!

Changed the tablespoons to teaspoons and this was still too salty. Maybe will try again without the garlic salt.

Oh my gosh. Way too much garlic salt and garlic powder. But I think it would have tasted great with maybe half the amount? Maybe even less.  I'll be trying again with less of those ingredients!

Very simple. Agree with some others on adjustments. The tabelspoons MUST be teaspoons. Even using 1 lb of shrimp 1 tsp of powder and salt is sufficient along with 2 tsps of minced garlic and half lemon. That worked for me and was very tasty.

I just made this and it's great.  I too reduced the seasonings, but used 1 Tbsp of minced garlic.  The sauce with the lemon is delicious.  Don't forget the bread. (I won't again).
