PERFECT! I have been wanting to make these for a while, but I did not have spiral cutter...I FINALLY got one last week, and this recipe was the first one that I thought to make, lol. The coating is so nice, light and crispy...The kids LOVED the spiral shapes too! LOVED the addition of the Old Bay seasoning at the end...a definite keeper and ANOTHER winning recipe from you, SHORECOOK, Thank You!!!!! :)

I finally treated myself to a spiral vegetable slicer, & wondered when on Earth I'd need it!  Well, I saw this recipe on another reci"peeps" site, and I decided to try it.  You made it so easy, I did zuuks, mushrooms, and some sweet onion rings!  I'm stuffed, they were so great!!!  And my friends say they are too!!  We all gave the recipe AND method a FIVE star rating!!!  Shorecook, you're a genius!!!  Thanks for posting!!!  Blessings!!!

We have a medium-sized Fry Daddy, big enough for the two of us. We learned not to crowd the zucchini spirals or they'll clump together. No need to tweak, this recipe is spot on with the ingredients and method. Thank you, Shorecook, for a winning recipe!

This recipe is a keeper. I added a little salt, pepper and paprika to the flour and cornstarch instead of seasoning after frying. It came out great.

Modification:  No spiralizer, we cut z. into "fries," about 3" long and 1/4-1/2" thick (finger sized).  Doubled the recipe due to size of z.  Used 1T season salt from a local bbq place in lieu of  Old Bay and 1t. smoked paprika.  They need more like 4-5 min in the fryer, and as I finished each batch I moved them into a 350 oven to hold.  Served with honey mustard  dressing for the kids, and they were a big hit!

Fantastic treat---I'm doing the "low carb" thing, so used more cornstarch than flour and it came out great.  We made one batch with Indian spices (garam masala, cumin, turmeric) in the flour mixture and they were awesome!  Thank you!!

I used squash and zucchini cut into slices. They tasted great although I would like them to brown better. I deep fried them and I would like to have a liquid breading recipe for deep frying.
