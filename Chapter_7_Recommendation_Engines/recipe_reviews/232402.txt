I didn't have sour cream, and used chicken breasts instead of a rotisserie chicken. It was really good, will make it again.

I boiled my own chicken and used that stock.  Added a few cloves of garlic and dry minced onion to the pot once it started to boil.  After that I followed the recipe, but did not use all of the noodles called for - added more chicken instead.  It was DELICIOUS!  And, made enough to freeze for a later meal.

This was really good.  It needed about 1/2 Tablespoon of kosher salt, 1/2 teas of pepper and something else.... so I added about 1/2 teas of Bouquet Garni.  Perfect!  I'll make it again soon.  Undercook the noodles a bit, just like she said.

I've made this a handful of times and it's always a hit. I usually stick with the rotisserie chicken. Tonight I did add a little celery in with the onions and I seasoned with a 1/2 tsp of tumeric. I also used white ground pepper. My family definitely prefers when I use the frozen egg noodles over the dried egg noodles. I have to agree. The sour cream really takes it over the top.

This was Ok and my family ate it the first time I made it.  The second time I added flour to the onions/butter to make a roux and then slowly added chicken broth to make a gravy.  Added a splash of heavy cream and the consistency was much better than the original recipe.

Did not put the amount of chicken broth called for, about 16 oz. is what I used.  Did not have half 'n'half so made my own with 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup evaporated canned milk and mixed together.  After made, I had more than I needed so will have left overs for the next couple of days.  Also added 1/2 can peas as my husbands favorite.  Very tasty and will make again.

This is very good!  I followed recipe exactly but used chicken breasts instead of rotisserie chicken. It was very tasty and my 3 teenage kids gobbled it up.  The recipe says to season with salt and pepper at the end.  I think next time I will add 1/2-1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper while it's cooking.  That's the only change I would make!  Thanks!

Great recipe, didn't have half and half so I used 2% milk and it was fine. The sauce is to die for, never had chicken and noodles like this before. Next time I would add some cooked vegetables. This is a keeper.

I made the recipe exactly as shown, except I normally overdo the amount of onions and garlic since I don't measure them out.  The noodles were a little soft. I would probably boil them even less next time.  I will also add peas next time too.  The recipe was a little bland, and it was HUGE, especially for two people.  We will have left-overs for at least two more dinners.

I swear I was going to follow this recipe to the tsp.  But when I discovered I had no egg noodles I thought I would use fettuccine instead... than realized I didn't have enough fettuccine, so I added in some angel hair pasta.  I was also hoping to add frozen broccoli, carrots, cauliflower mix and was out of those.  Last minute I added a handful of fresh spinach.  The sauce is very rich and wonderful. Once done I added some fresh Parmesan and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again and add different veggies to the mix, but the basic recipe would be perfect all by itself.  This is a keeper!

This is a great, basic recipe that is easy to modify. I added peas, a zucchini (halved, sliced, then sauteed in butter), and Sunny Paris seasoning from The Spice House - that sent it over the top! I have just enough left-overs for lunch and I'm going to fry some bacon and crumble into it - should have thought to try that last night!

taste is good. add salt and pepper to taste as you prepare. the sauce was rather thin.  I par cooked thin pasta and then added to sauce towards the end.  it should thicken as it
 sets and cools.

Very creamy. The sour cream adds a nice flavor. I added thyme, lemon zest and tajin to increase the flavor complexity.

Exceptional chicken and noodles. I didn't have half and half but I had some heavy cream. Googled the substitute:  1/4 c cream 3/4 c milk. It may have even been creamer.  I added a cup of frozen carrots and served it along with good ole mashed potatoes. A bit much for two but enough left over for lunch and dinner the next day.

This is delicious. Alterations I made was boiled my own chicken and used the stock from that. I also added a can of vegall and I didn't have half and half so subbed evaporated milk. Worked fine! Will make again. And it makes a HUGE pot!

this was delicious, i did cut back on the broth as some mentioned but not too much as i make my own egg noodles and they help to thicken the broth up a bit. overall a delicious meal.

The sauce was kind of thin, so I also would recommend decreasing the amount of broth. It is kind of bland, for those who like spice. Some cracked black pepper available on the table should take care of that, for those who want it.

Must be me, I used my own cooked chicken, didn't have half & half, but used Heavy Whipping Cream.  I found it way too soupy, had to use half a block of Velveeta Cheese to thicken it up.  I was not impressed with this recipe, and would not make it again.

Use less broth and / or milk.  I had to add cornstarch / water mixture to mine to thicken it up a bit more.
