I cut this recipe down to 1/3 (20 servings) to make it is my bread machine on the dough setting. I waited until the second punch down to add the raisins. My yield was two small loaves - one for my family and one to give away as a hosting gift. The flavor was good (I added more raisins) and of course with the oats the texture was so soft. It definately satisfied my craving for raisin bread!

A little too dense and heavy for my taste. I used light flavored molasses but it was still a bit strong it definately overpowered the cinnamon flavor.

We really liked this bread. I cut the recipe back to 12 servings or 1 loaf. I did have to add a tad more flour probably 1/3 cup. The cinnamon/raisin/molasses ratio is just right and it bakes up to a great tasting bread.

I thought this had too much water. I had double the oats to make up for it because I ran out of flour. turned out tasty though
