My daughter is a Celiac so we need to make everything gluten free. Substituted Gf baking flour and gf corn flour for the two flours in the recipe. Also used fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned. Turned out great!

4.29.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/242025/thanksgiving-muffins/ ... This is the best recipe I’ve made in a longggg time! Thank you for sharing your recipe! I had 15oz pumpkin purée to use & subbed it for the sweets. Rather than soak in water, I combined the dried cranberries with the pumpkin & coconut oil; refrig’d overnight. Instead of oat flour, oats & I may increase to 3/4c next time. The batter was pretty thick. I added a half cup milk. It lightened them considerably, maybe too much. The density was more like cupcakes. Not a complaint; observation. Betz had some jumbo jumbo muffins!  This yielded 18 regulars in my house.  C: ... Notes: E said these - thanksgiving ones were “Fantastic” These ... https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62167408/fall-festival-pumpkin-cranberry-muffins/ ... were too sweet & spiced, but good;  Not better than Thanksgiving ones. 'May try adding 1/2t ginger.

I find it hard to believe these are over 500 calories - they’re really pretty healthy. Like some others, I used a can of pumpkin in place of the sweet potatoes. I also substituted ground flax seed for the oatmeal flour - just because I had it - and added a teaspoon of vanilla. The recipe made 9 large muffins and 1 small loaf. They were surprisingly moist (wheat flour...) and very tasty. I will be making these again! Thanks!

Really a lovely recipe. I used a can of unsweetened pumpkin for sweet potato and oatmeal instead of the whole wheat flour.

I didn't have sweet potatoes in the house so I substituted sweet potatoes and oil for a can of sugar free apple pie.  The cupcakes were delicious

Perfect muffins and a great way to use up leftover sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing!
