If you've ever made ginger snaps, you know the dough is supposed to be dry. This is similar, however in making this recipe as written, the dough was already getting brittle after I mixed in the first cup of flour... but it was such a lovely deep brown color and the spices were already smelling so wonderful that I refused give up! I kept adding melted butter and sugar till I got the right consistency while mixing in the second cup of flour. All told, I added 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter and 1 cup melted brown sugar, plus an extra 1/2 tsp. of all the spices. I skipped the oil altogether. It was worth the effort and the cookies came out just as delicious as I'd initially hoped! These crunchy, spicy treats make a delightful contrast on a Christmas cookie tray with richer sweet items.

These cookies are the best!  I am making them for a neighborhood cookie swap.  My husband loves them!  My recipe is a little different with more buttermargarine and no corn oil is added.  Do try this if you haven't!

Like mjteodori, the dough can get a bit crumbly.  Instead of using 2 cups of flour, I only used 1.5.  I also added a liny bit more butter to loosen the dough.  Overall, great recipe, though.  Very flavorfull!

Maybe I didn't do this properly, but the dough was so dry that I had an extremely difficult time making wafers out of it.

Great recipe. You need a little TLC with the dough. My previous recipe required 1-2 hours in the frig before rolling out not room temp. I find this a little easier than working with room temp dough.

The dough was a little hard to work with because it's dense. Great amount of spice! I will maybe add a little less flour and see if that helps. I'll review again.

I've made these a few times and they always come out perfectly. I would point out that of you are in the UK, I think you need to use golden syrup instead of the molasses specified. I'm not sure if the word has the same meaning here as in the US. I tried them with our molasses (the black stuff) but they were vile. With golden syrup, they are great. If the dough seems a bit dry and crumbly sometimes,  I add a few drops of water which softens it up.
