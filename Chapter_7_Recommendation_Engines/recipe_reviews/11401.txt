Barb's recipes is true to it's word-- these cookies are very soft and cake-like. I added a couple dashes of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla and omitted the lemon zest and nutmeg. I also molded dough into balls and then flattened them by hand. Overall, a very good sugar cookie. I would recommend under baking these slightly at 7 1/2-8 minutes.

This recipe makes a very cake like cookie.  Be careful to take out when the tops are just beginning to lose their glisten.  Made 24 2-1/2 inch round cookies when using heaping teaspoon full of dough.

I think this is a great basic recipe.  The dough was very manageable.  I excluded Lemon Zest or Nugmeg, but added Caramon.

My four kids and my husband loved these cookies- they are very delicately-flavored and it's convenient not having to refrigerate the dough like many other sugar cookie recipes.  I'll definitely make these again!

These are awesome. I didn't have any lemon zest so I added a few drops of lemon extract and it worked great! My husband, a sugar cookie fanatic, is going to love them. Thanks!

I thought these tasted great but they did spread & came out looking like normal, flat cookies. Unfortunately, I had picked these because of the picture which shows nice puffy, mound cookies, so that was a little disappointing.UPDATE ONE DAY LATER: Changing a 4 star rating to a 2 star because, once completely cooled these are a mess! They're so soft, you can't pick them up & they have a TERRIBLE aftertaste-which I'm sure is the baking soda. My gut told me to decrease the baking soda but I figured, with the good reviews & no one else mentioning the excessive measurement, it must be ok. But it wasn't.

really good cookie dough, and  ok cookies..They came out crispy and flat. They are time sensitive in the oven which makes it hard to time them right. They also leave a little after taste that isn't the best... other than that  they were good

pros: quick recipe, nice batter, look good when baked.
cons: these cookies taste like bland yellow cake, which is disappointing because I thought that the lemon and nutmeg would add an interesting zip!  These cookies also gave me heartburn and sat like rocks in my chest/stomach.  And I don't usually have any problems with eating!  I would not recommend this recipe to a friend.  I would also rather  try a more complicated cookie recipe than make these again.

Had to add extra flour dough was super sticky. Even adding at least another half cup of flour the dough was too sticky to make into balls as other reviews had said. taste okay I added a little vanilla and almond extracts along with the zest and nutmeg. Sprinkled sugar on top. Kids liked them. Thanks !

These easy-to-prepare cookies were a delight to find here on AllRecipes! Very good tasting; a nice variation on the sugar cookie.

I must preface by saying I'm not a cooking expert!  But the dough was too sticky to flatten with a glass.  The cookie was very soft inside, like cake (which isn't a bad thing), but I would have liked it to be sweeter.  It's good, though.

Delicious!  Very easy to make and so good.  Tastes a little like snickerdoodles, but with a softer center.  My husband ate about a dozen of them with tea last night, until I told him to take them away!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Barb!

Pretty good. A little bland so next time I'll double up on some of the spices. They were too sticky to flatten with a glass. Also, they came out kind of crispy.

A really nice light cookie. I never put salt into any dessert recipes. The cookie baked up on the flat side but overall a really nice tart cookie.

I have made these cookies twice. Both times the cookies were gone within 24 hours! They are soft and not too heavy. Great flavour.

I tried this recipe with cinnamon and vanilla instead of nutmeg and lemon zest. turned out wonderful. I also add a 1/2 cup coconut to it and they taste great with the add ingredient.
I love this recipe.
Thanks for sharing this recipe Barb!

i recomend using lemon extract not lemon zest. They come out flat and only cook them for about 10 minutes. They have a very unpleasent after taste. From the lemon zest you can see the chunks of it in the cookie also so that makes it look unapitizing....... my overall reaveiw is that is taste like medicine.
