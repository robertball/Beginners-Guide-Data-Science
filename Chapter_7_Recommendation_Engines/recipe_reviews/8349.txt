Overall its a great recipe. Few tricks of the trade need to be used though.  
1. I used homestyle butter cake mix with a stick of butter- mix until CRUMBLY and pat it into the pan and bake for 10 min. 
2. Unlike stated in the recipe, the cream cheese mixture will not pour on top of the cake mix because it is too sticky- so I just dollop it all over the top of the hot cake layer and let it set for a minute and lightly spread it all over the cake- the heat makes the cream cheese easier to work with.  
3.Bake for 35 min, or when you see the cream cheese layer rise around the EDGE of the pan and brown.  It will not rise to the top as stated in the recipe.
4. I used canned lemon filling with this instead of cherries- it makes great lemon bars!  I haven't had any problems with sticking- I use the Bakers Secret 13 X 9" Cake pan if that helps.

Try it again with my hints and you won't be disappointed.

THIS IS A DELICIOUS RECIPE. HOWEVER, THERE IS AN ERROR IN THE PRINTING. IT CALLS FOR ONE CUP OF BUTTER, WHEN IT MOST DEFINITELY SHOULD BE ONE STICK, OR 1/2 CUP. I TRIED TO MAKE THE RECIPE AS PRINTED, BUT THE DOUGH DID NOT COME OUT "CRUMBLY", AND NEVER COOKED. I WENT AHEAD AND ADDED THE OTHER INGREDIENTS, BUT IT BAKED OVER THE PAN AND THERE WAS RAW CAKE BATTER INSIDE. IT NEVER COOKED. JUST WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW!

I followed the recipe as directed, and the cake was wonderful!  However, 
I tried to vary the recipe by using Devil's Food Cake mix, and it did not work well. 
If the mix is not crumbly, then you have over-stirred the mixture.  Follow the 
recipe (USE SOFTENED BUTTER AND CREAM CHEESE - DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER!)
as directed, and you will get pats on the back as I did!!  VERY VERY RICH Tasting!  Also, remember to put the cream cheese down first, or the cherries will make the bottom crust/cake very soggy and awful!

Gooey Goodness!!!  I was nervous while it was baking, I used a dark non-stick pan instead of the glass one the recipe called for.  I noticed after 10 minutes of baking the edges were starting to get really brown so I covered the whole dish with foil and baked for 30 more minutes.  It was gooey and wonderful, everyone loved it.  I'll definately be making this again.  If you're expecting a solid bar this isn't the recipe that you want.  Also, it's super rich so serving it with vanilla ice cream helps cut the sweetness.

This cake was simple to make and tasted so good!  My husband loved it, as did everyone we shared it with.  It's not the prettiest thing, but the taste is amazing so well worth it.  I will definitely make this again.

I have found so many good recipes at 'allrecipes', so I had high hopes for this one. It was hands down, one of the worst I have ever made. Even after reading the reviews and making the suggested changes, it was a disappointment .
It stuck to the pan, took twice as long to bake, the cherries didn't sink. I will not make this cake again.

Followed the directions exactly. Too sweet, too rich, took too long to cook. Throwing this out.

This cake turned out like everyone else has stated:  The cherries didn't rise to the top (which isn't a huge deal, but it's what you expect when the recipe says that's what will happen), the center didn't cook, and I couldn't spread the cream cheese mixture over the gooey crust.

When it was done baking, the outside edges were nearly burned, and the middle was still gooey.

I probably won't make this recipe again.  I wish I had read the reviews before making this.

This cake was a huge hit at our family Christmas party last year and I was asked to bring it to Easter too.  I just came back to print the recipe for a friend who heard how good it is.  I think I'll make it for our July 4th picnic this year.  The recipe is absolutely perfect just as it is!!!

Very good, family liked it a lot. It helped, I think, to let the crust cool a little before spreading the cream cheese mixture. I agree the cheese spread didn't really rise to the top as much as bubble up at the edges. Crust was perfect, it helped to have graham cracker crumbs which already have shortening mixed in with them. Overall, a good recipe and already my husband requested it for Fourth of July.

There is no way that this cake can turn out as the recipe is written.  I am an experienced baker and tried this cake as I was looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand.  I should have read the reviews first.  I agree with another viewer that this probably should have been 1 stick instead of one cup.  And there is absolutely no way you can pour the cream cheese mixture.  After baking the crust for the 10 minutes it was jusr gooey, then after blobing the stif cream cheese mix on top it just all mixed together.  Not wanting to waste my ingredients, I just mixed it all up anyway and put the cherries on top.  It is back in the oven for 35 minutes...and well, we will just see how it turns out.  Bad I am thinking at this point. I just don't see how it can work.  I thought these recipes were tried before they listed them!  Folks, don't try this one at home!

Followed the recipe and it just didn't turn out right.  The cakey/crusty part was gooey in the middle.  All said and done, with all the fun and yummy recipes out there, this one is not worth the time.

I think I may have done something wrong with this one.  I think (if there is a) next time, I would grease the pan (it stuck horribly!) Also, the crust was waaaay to buttery, and my cream cheese/cherry layer came out really "goopy".  The cherries did not come out to the top.  It tasted okay, but I don't think it will become a favorite.  As I said, I may have done something wrong.  :-(

I agree that one stick of butter is plenty.  My supervisor told me to never bring this to work again because she cannot stay out of it.  Everyone loves it!

Use this recipe with caution. I used a metal 9x13 pan, and the cake stuck to the bottom. Could not get the cake out of the pan. I did cut the butter to 1 stick. Not sure why this did not turn out?

This is indeed a VERY rich cake! It was a hit at my house. I already have a great recipe for chess cake and basically I just added the cherries to that. The only problem I had was that the cherries did not go to the bottom and it took forever to cook(a little over an hour!). I eneded up having to poke the cherries with a toothpick in the middle of baking to make them go under. I achieved my goal, but it was a little too much trouble. All in all, it was a very good and moist cake.
