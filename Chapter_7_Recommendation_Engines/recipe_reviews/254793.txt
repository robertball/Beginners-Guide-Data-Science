This is a good recipe for those of us who are baking-challenged. It’s easy to put together and uses pretty common ingredients in my house. It sets well, too. Unfortunately, the lemon ruined this for me. I will make this again, just without the lemon. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe has potential! I made it as directed first and found it to be lacking in flavor. I ended up adding 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, along with an extra cup (maybe two!) of pumpkin. I just kept adding until it tasted right. (My pumpkin wasn't canned however, so that could have affected it. I make my own purée and maybe that's why) try it out!!!

I thought I’d try this recipe as a change to my previous dish. If I attempt this recipe again (unlikely), I will omit the lemon juice as it overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor. Also, the consistency was more like pudding. Will go back to my trued and true recipe.
