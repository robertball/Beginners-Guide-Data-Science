This is a wonderful recipe if you follow the directions and ingredients!!! It belonged to a grandmother, that means when it was written they didn't have "instant" anything. Use whole, non-instant ingredients. That means LARGE WHOLE eggs, WHOLE Milk, NON-INSTANT Pearl Tapioca and NON-INSTANT Rice. Yes, it will take longer. For a rich, delicious dessert,  use quality ingredients.

My husband and I like Tapioca Pudding.  As I read the ingredients on this recipe, I thought it sounded so good!  I then read the reviews and was really confused, but I made this recipe anyway.  Since I did not have any pearl tapioca on hand, I used minute tapioca and let the ingredients set the required five minutes before starting to cook; I also used 1 cup uncooked minute rice which I added before baking.  I omitted the raisins as my husband does not like them.  As another reviewer mentions, it did look curdled when I took it out of the oven; that disappeared as it cooled.  After this cooled overnight and the flavors blended, it was very good!  When I make this again, I think that I will omit the baking and just boil it per the instructions on the minute tapioca, adding the uncooked rice and vanilla after it has boiled.

This is a good Tapioca pudding recipe. But it doesn't need baking. Simply prepare it on your stove-top as indicated in the recipe, allow it to cool for perhaps 10-15 minutes then cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour or more. Delicious! Great with whipped cream or CoolWhip on top.(want it creamier? fold in 1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream just prior to refrigerating it)

First try didn't thicken so well , so I changed the recipe some , I used 1 1/2 cups of quick tapioca instead of the rice and added the eggs and vanilla after the tapioca thickened on top of the stove , then added the raisins , WORKED GREAT and didn't bake in oven ! ! ! ! the first try I don't think the tapioca was cooked long enough (my fault)the longer you cook the tapioca the thicker it gets the whole family loved it ! ! ! !

There must be a "secret" missing from this recipe.  Mine came out watery and curdled.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written.  Maybe 15 minutes on top of the stove is too much? Mine looked very thick and almost completely cooked by 12 minutes, and I did NOT let it boil.  I then put it in the pan, baked it 20 mins, stirred in the raisins (I had forgotten them) and vanilla, etc., as written, but it came out terrible.

This recipe is good.  Came out fine, with a nice old-fashioned flavor and texture.   NOTE to those who had poor results:  DO NOT use "instant" tapioca or rice!  You must use the old-fashioned, long-cooking types or your results will be nothing like it is supposed to turn out.   Those who followed the ingredients exactly had a wonderful result so you may want to give it another try.

This was a great start to what I had made. I made a few changes.  I used quick tapioca pudding (4tbsp), 3 cups of vanilla almond milk, since I can't have dairy, and substituted the sugar for 1/4 cup maple syrup. Cooked it on the stove top as per the quick tapioca instructions.  Turned out fabulous.

My husband made this and I thought it turned out really well.  He used instant tapioca, minute rice and whole milk.  The raisins plump up really nice in this recipe.  I'd have it again!

An easy and fast recipe.  It tasted as wonderful as it smelled.  This was also a great dessert for my daughter who has severe celiac disease.

This recipe was so good! I love tapioca pudding and i love rice pudding so putting the two together who would have thought! Anyway I made this twice once following the original recipe and once using almond milk.  I cook the rice in milk, butter and a tsp of vanilla. I was trying to figure out the separation that others talked about. Both ways doing this (cooking the rice same as mentioned above both times) I never did get the curdling I did cook it longer then mentioned because I did not just stick it in the oven and forget about it. I took it out about every 10 mins to stir it. This might have been why it did not curdle. I do agree with others it could be cooked right on the stove top without putting in the oven. I however did not use anything instant and really did not take long to make.

Sciamhach was right.  I used minute tapioca and jasmine rice.  It took just as long to fix it because the rice didn't soften up for a very long time. Mine might have worked if I had used  basmati rice, which is softer and cooks faster, but I couldn't say for sure.  It was good, but chewy and the cinnamon and nutmeg combination were great. I am thinking it would be okay with minute tapioca and minute rice, take less time, and not be as fancy.
