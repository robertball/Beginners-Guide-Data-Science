excellent! I might increase the amount of the upper pastry part to get more of the more custard-y part, although I don't know if that would work well. The ingredients say 1 tbsp butter in the glaze, the instructions say 2 -- I used 1.5 and it was perfect. Super easy, not too sweet, and great-tasting.

A "major" keeper of a recipe!  The cream puff topping, truly did bake into a marzipan like custard.  This morning, two happy tummies enjoyed Scandinavian Almond Puff as a hedonistic, mid-week breakfast, with strong cups of coffee---and 6 friends at work will be indulging within the hour!

just made the lemon version and brought to my office. it was a huge hit.  I added a little more lemon juice to the glaze and a little salt to cut the sweetness.  truly a wonderful recipe.  make sure to let topping cool down a little before adding eggs, otherwise the eggs will scramble.  can't wait to make this again.

My mother used to make this recipe. It's great!  I made it into two long strips so that it was easier to serve and it seemed to feed more people.  I needed to reduce the cooking time by about 15 min.  Great recipe!

This is fantastic!  Everyone raved about it.  Tastes like it's more difficult to make than it actually is.

I made this for my father-in-law's birthday because he's not a fan of traditional cake. It looked and smelled delicious! All of my in-laws loved it, but it wasn't sweet enough for me at all (that's why it only got 4 stars). Also, mine didn't come out in a marzipan texture like another review mentioned, so perhaps I over cooked it.

Tasted very eggy.  I love almond flavored things, but this wasn't very good.  What a waste.

I made this with trepidation due to some comments as to its not being sweet enough.  However, I followed instructions anyway with only one exception - I used soya margarine instead of butter. 
What a great dessert!  Great presentation, fantastic taste, with a nice custardy filling.  The icing provides a perfect balance of sweetness. It's the first time I've seen people take second and third helpings of a dessert.
I'll be making this again soon. So will two of my guests.  Worth 10 stars.
