I was absolutely prepared to love this recipe, but sadly it fell short.  We had intended to make it for Christmas this year, but fortunately we previewed it beforehand, and decided not to make it.
The taste was just fine, but the problem was that the cheese sauce somehow overpowered the taste of the wonderful (and very expensive) seafood to the point where our guests were unable to even tell that there was crab and lobster meat in it!
This might be a lovely dish to make with less expensive seafood, but for what it costs to put this one together you at least want your guests to know that you've used the very best.  Instead it comes across as if it is hiding less expensive or (horrors) immitation seafood.

This would be a lovely sauce to make with firm white fish fillets.  If you do decide to make it with scallops, remember that when scallops cook they release quite a lot of water, so make sure your sauce is VERY thick when you put it into the oven (do this by gradually adding the milk to the sauce, and leave much of it out!).  Some parsely flakes might also add to the appeal of the presentation.  Without it it does look rather like macaroni and cheese.

This was a very yummy, but very rich recipe. I used it as an alternative to my other main course. I thought the dish was a bit soupy. Next time I make it, I will saute the vegatables in butter or oil then add the seafood coat with the butter in the pan and then add the flour to coat the vegatables and meat than add the milk and cheese. Perhaps it will be thicker and the flavor will blend better. This recipe also served more than 4. I would say, it served about 6-8.

Solution for thickening...  This is how you make a roux or white sauce, but in reverse.  Look up how to make a white sauce and replace it with the quoted below.

"Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium heat, and mix in the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons butter until well blended. Gradually blend the cheese into the mixture. Season with salt and pepper. "

This was very good, it was a big hit with everyone. Would be much better served on pasta, because it never got thick enough to eat as a cassole.  I had to cook it for about 1hr and then finally gave up on it ever getting thick. I also added about 1 additional cup of cheese. I will definitely make it again.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I didn't follow it exactly.  I used 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. I also added 2 tablespoons of sherry to the milk mixture.  For spices, I added nutmeg, old bay, and cayenne pepper.  Finally, I doubled the cheese (I used shredded monterey jack).  Doubling the cheese and using heavy cream made it a little thicker.  I then served it over white rice.  Delicious!

This is a really wonderful recipe.  You can switch around the seafood as much as you please.  For those that are having problems with this being too soupy, it might be your seafood.  Stores sometimes fill seafood with water, especially scallops.  When cooked, the seafood releases the water.  Make sure you dry off your seafood, or even let it drain for a few minutes on a paper towel.  My friend gave me this advice and it has helped tremendously with my seafood recipes.  If that doesn't work, you can always pour this over noodles, and no one will ever know!  :)  Happy eating!

I tripled the seafood and doubled the other ingredients to serve 16 people.  It was a very tasty dish to go along with our Christmas Eve dinner.

This might be better to serve in individual baking dishes.  Mine came out more like a sauce to spoon over noodles.
I liked the flavor, and it was pretty easy. I did add some sliced, fresh mushrooms and 1/4 sherry to the vegetables.
It didn't really 'brown' either, even after putting it under the broiler for awhile.  Maybe a light bread crumb topping would be a good addition.
My husband loved it. Maybe if the noodles were cooked in the dish also it would be more of a casserole.

In response to OsuzyQ about the cheddar being too strong, I have a similar recipe that calls for Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar.  It makes it much more velvety as the name implies.

Try it served with puff pastry it's even better! Sometimes our local stores don't have the crab, you can substitute imitation and it still works. Do not however, substitute the lobster shrimp or scallops.

Glad I found this, we had it done by an executive chef at a local dining establishment, and when he left, the
recipe went with him! They only ran it as a special when he was working! He served in in layers over puff pasty pillows.

This was good but not Christmas Eve good. I made it for a crowd. I think I was looking for something thicker & richer. But it is tasty.

This was delicious, I omitted the scallops and just used extra shrimp(not fond of scallops). Very good, and I will make again. In fact my son wants me to make it for the feast of the 7 fishes on Christmas Eve. Thanks.

I made this for Christmas Eve. I like it because it was fast and easy to prepare - I made it in the afternoon and refrigerated it until we were ready to eat, then popped it into the oven for half an hour before we sat down. I had read other comments about this dish being too cheesy and overwhelming the delicate flavors of the seafood, so I cut back on the cheese just a bit, and we used frozen seafood to make it. We served this dish with a choice of a baked potatoe or rice and it went beautifully well with both. It will be a Christmas Eve tradition from now on with us. I am going to cut back on the liquids and try it in my crockpot next time.

Easy way to thicken is to use potato flakes ( like in the box for making mashed potatoes ) they thicken and don't interfere with the flavour at all

Delicious recipe.  I used one 10 oz. can of cream of mushroom soup and 10 oz. of creamo instead of the milk.   I used 1 can of crabmeat, prawns cut into pieces and scallops.  I agree this is a rich recipe so poured the casserole onto herbed rice instead of by itself.  Will definitely make again.

I followed some review suggestions, adding mushrooms, green chilies & bell-pepper to the onion sauté  but omitted chopped celery instead using  dried celery & garlic powder. Also Used 1/2 & 1/2 cheddar cheese & velveeta cheese. It was served over corn bread with an ample amount of sauce.  Used the adjustment button of 6 servings & it's going to make delicious leftovers.  My husband said it couldn't have tasted better but next time it will!  Half & half milk and green onions are going to knock it out the park.  We opted for a pound of shrimp & crawfish, omitting the other seafoods.  This will go into rotation for Christmas.  Yummy x2.  Can't wait to make it again - with egg noodles.  A beautiful casserole, browned really well after 40 minutes - topped with bread crumbs. Season up 'cause it needs that balance with the richness.  Red pepper & black worked.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used 4 oz cream cheese instead of cheddar as one of the complaints was the cheddar overpowered the taste of the seafood.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs on top and it made this seafood casserole more eye appealing and delicious.  I would definitely make this again.

This was great! A couple of different things, I used pepper Jack cheese slices instead and didn't have any lobster meat but it wasn't missed.

Next time I make it, I plan to used breadcrumbs and try oysters and use oysters.

I took some reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 C heavy cream and 1/2 C milk, mixed with a can of cream of mushroom soup. I didn't mix in any flour or butter, but did add some shredded cheddar cheese.  I poured the "casserole" over cooked white rice and the family absolutely loved it.  Reheats well too.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! No imitation seafood used in this recipe! I made a couple of changes/substitutions. Instead of using milk and flour, I used heavy cream for a thicker, creamier constitution. And, instead of cheese slices I used shredded cheese to melt and blend faster, easier. This is more of a bisque than a casserole; so serve in a bowl. This is probably the best thing I've made!

Really easy to make. I used shrimp & scallops and sautéed the onion a bit for a milder onion taste. This was a nice addition to our family seafood feast on Christmas Eve and everyone enjoyed it. But I would make this again anytime of year, not just a holiday. This is a good dish to take to a dinner party as well.

I followed this recipe to a "T". It turned out great and was gone before everything else served for Christmas dinner. I read all the recipes and came up with a couple of things. Add flour to milk very slowly using a whisk to create the rue. Use only fresh seafood. Frozen tends to emit a lot of water. sprinkled with panko for a light crust. Thank you for sharing this recipe will make again.

As previously stated it was watery.  I doubled and  combined cheeses and served over fine noodles.  I will make it again but will add spices to enhance the delicate flavors of the seafood.

While the flavor of this recipe is pretty good, as many other reviewers have stated, the end result is too thin and soupy. In the future, I will probably attempt to use heavy cream and/or more cheese to make the end result thicker. In terms of the flavor, I may add some cayenne pepper; though it offered a good flavor, it could have used some added zip.

I made this last year for Christmas eve.  Since then it has been requested from family for other special days.  We serve this in phyllo patty shells.  Phyllo makes everything better, in our opinion.

This was a VERY tasty dish.  I added a little more seafood & cheese to it.  It is pretty runny so I put it over pasta.  DEFINITELY will make again!!
