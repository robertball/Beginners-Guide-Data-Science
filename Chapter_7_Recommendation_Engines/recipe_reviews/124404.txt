These were delicious. I served them to company last night and everyone loved them. I did take the other reviewer's suggestion and cooked them for about an hour, they turned out wonderfully soft and tasty. I used Ida Red apples and I'm giving this 4 stars because if you were to take them out at 35 min as directed, they're still hard. It's like any other recipe though, just check to see if your food's done before you take it out of the oven!

We love apples, but we were not happy about this recipe.  One suggestion: If you want the apples soft, the bake time should be much longer for a hard apple.

As usual I tweaked this recipe a bit and we loved it so I've made it often. I took it to a recent potluck of 10 people. It was going to either be a side dish or dessert. I decided it would make a great dessert served with a dallop of vanilla ice cream for anyone who wanted it. I prefer the flavor without the ice cream. I used golden delicious apples and cut them in half. Placed them in a casserole dish, mixed other ingredients and and spooned this mixture on each half. I used the Spiced Baked Apples recipe but changed it slightly for our tastes such as slightly less spices and a little more walnut pieces, raisins and added cranraisins. Of course I had to calculate for 6 apples rather than two and added a little more brown sugar and water so there would be plenty of liquid. Used 6 apples so had 12 halves. Baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 30 minutes. An instant hit with this crowd of expert cooks. (all retired folks)Will make it again and again as we live in apple country and eat a lot of apples.

I followed the suggestions in the reviews for the most part, and these turned out really well! I put brown sugar and butter in the center of each apple, and made the water, flour (we didn't have cornstarch), chopped nuts and spices mixture to set the apples in while baking. Also did the foil for 20 minutes, then remove the foil for the last 10 minutes suggestion. These were DELICIOUS served with vanilla ice cream! My husband and I really enjoyed them.

Better than I was expecting!  The orange zest is a genius addition!  I coved the apples with foil, so I had no problems getting the apples to fully bake in 30 minutes.
To make this dessert guilt-free, use Splenda brown sugar mix--you won't even know the difference!

I did not have nuts on hand so I left them out. I used Jazz apples. My apples were done at 45 minutes. This was very good, though quite sweet. I think next time I might try this with a little  maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Very simple.

Very tasty. I made a few minor changes. I used orange juice instead of some of the water and orange peel because it's what I had on hand.  I also reduced the nutmeg.  I used Cortland apples and did bake for longer.

I was very excited to try this recipe and eventhough I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and baked the apples for an hour they were still not as soft as I was hoping for. That's the only reason for not giving it 5 stars. Next time I'll try a different kind of apple or maybe bake them a little longer.

I too enjoyed this recipe! My first time baking apples and they were wonderful. I also cooked my apples a little longer than recommended for softness. Great with whipped cream or ice cream.

I haven’t had baked apples since I was a young girl and this brought back such warm memories of my mother making them for my brother, sister and me.  Hers weren’t quite as embellished as these, and I must say I do prefer her simpler version. I left out the nuts to accommodate Hubs and used all cinnamon and no nutmeg to appease me.  I had to bake these longer than the recipe directed.  Found I wasn’t a fan of the orange peel and could have done without the raisins as well.  Served these nice and warm with heavy cream.

I made this as a side dish for Christmas.  I had 17 guests arriving and used 10 Gala apples.  As another reviewer mentioned, I cut the apples in half and placed them face up in two 11 x 9 casserole dishes.  I put the raisin and nut mixture in the middle of each and poured the sugar mixture over each.  I wrapped them tightly with foil as another reviewer mentioned and they were done in 30 minutes.  They were a huge hit, everyone was raving about them!

These were pretty tasty, but leave them in the oven for about 45-50 minutes so that they'll be soft.

I used gala apples, the work just as well if not better.  It's always a huge hit when I make them.  Put a thin slice of butter over the top of each apple before popping them in the oven.

EZ & excellent! I never made them THIS good before. I only had 1 FUJI apple home when I decided to make this. I cut apple in 1/2, cleaned it out, stuffed it w/ the raisin mixture, I only had roasted salted almonds so I put them in the food processor and that was a good decision. Forgot the orange peel. Baked for 40 min. The apple halves were still a bit crunchy/firm but that was great! This would be excellent for company. VERY happy!

I did things a little differently.  I peeled and sliced the 3 fuji apples as if for apple pie.  Then I mixed the raisins, walnuts and orange peel with them.  I then poured a double recipe of the wet ingredients over.  Baked for over an hour, still just got tender in about 75 minutes.  The timing of this recipe is very wrong.  The taste is great though.

Fantastic and sooo easy! We didn't have any orange peel so we omitted that and used pecans instead of walnuts. We also added 15 minutes to the baking time for softer apples and uncovered for the last ten minutes. We used an entire bag of small red apples for our Hallocheesy movie night and they were devoured in minutes!

These came out wonderful.  I adjusted the recipe for 15 people, and served as a side dish to a crown pork roast instead of applesauce.  Everyone loved it and said delicious!  :-)

I followed the recipe exactly, using 4 Gala apples.  Even though I baked them for additional time,  they still weren't soft,  and the filling didn't taste good.  My family (and me too) did not care for it.

I used 1 golden delicious and 1 Gala apple; we like the gala better. Easiest to start with boiling the sugar mixture first, then coring the apples and last combining the raisin and nuts. 1/2 hour is fine for me otherwise the apple skins started to split and it was a bit too soft. Very yummy though.

Fantastic recipe! Other reviewers must not be using cooking apples, because I used locally grown Gala apples and the only thing I did different was that I used dried cranberries since I dislike raisins, apple cider instead of water, and a splash of lemon juice in place of orange peel since I was out. My apples came out tender and delicious in 30 minutes... if I had cooked them an hour like other people suggested I would have practically had applesauce! Johnathans and Galas are the best apples for this kind of thing. Do not use apples like Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, or Red Delicious unless you want to spend an hour + baking them...  Know your apples, and you won't have a problem at all :)

WOW! These were AMAZING!  I really wasn't expecting these to be so good even after reading the reviews.  We are hosting Thanksgiving this year for about 15 people and I wanted another desert other then the common pies and such...this is it! It was not too spicy or sweet.  I followed the directions to a tee and cooked my apples for 45 minutes.  (as another person mentioned, I think it depends on the types and sizes of the apples.) The presentation itself will be wonderful but I can't wait to see their faces when they try the dish!

These were great!  I used apple cider instead of the water and poured some cream over everything before putting in the oven.  Delicious.  I think it depends on what kind of apple you use as to how long you need to bake.  I used Jonathans and they were done in less than 30 minutes.

Excellent!  I used Macintosh apples (Which are a softer apple) and cooked the 30 mins as directed.  They were done just right.  In place of just coring the apples, I used a corer/slicer and put the apple wedges (with skin left on) in a 9" square pan then sprinkled the topping over top followed by pouring  the sugar mixture over all.  The apples were a hit!

Came out great following the recipe at par and 35 minutes cooking time. Apples vary in texture and ripeness so of course cooking time will vary. Very versatile recipe to suit everyone's needs like sweetness or substitution (I had found this bag of dried raisins, cranberries and cherries which help tone down the taste of raisins).

This recipe was good, although I did change it based on what I had on hand. I cored the apple and since I didn't have orange peel I squirted some lemon juice around the inside of the apple.  Then I sprinkled cinnamon on the inside as well.  I did want some of the brown sugar and butter inside the apple so I mixed some together and layered it with the walnuts and raisins mixture.  then in a bowl i melted the butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar in the microwave. (I didn't have any nutmeg).  I lined a baking dish with foil, put the apple in and poured the sauce over the apple and along the bottom.  I baked at 375 with the foil folded over the top for 20 min and with the foil open 10 min.  The apple was warm but still crisp and it was delicious with the thick sugary sauce

Excellent! I added ground clove to the spice mixture and served with a side of vanilla ice cream. My mom used to make these for my brother and I every Christmas!

Perhaps I did something wrong or the recipe was just different than what I was expecting but I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  I didn't enjoy the taste of the filling and found it a little overpowering.  I'm glad I made it to try it out but I don't think its something I would make again.

OH MY! I feel like I died and went to heaven! This is amazingly delicious! I have to make this for my mom , who made this type of apple for us after school many times. I haven't had one in years! My partner agreed it was absolutely delicious!  I cooked it with the juice from the orange as well as the rind grated up. Also added some chopped dates along with the walnuts and raisins. Used my new blue casserole and kept it covered for the first half hour and then uncovered for fifteen minutes and it was perfect! Thank you Lorraine for the wonderful recipe!

These were fabulous! To ensure softness I laid tin foil out on a small pie tin, placed the apples on top, filled them and drizzled them with the sauce and then pulled up the sides of the foil to make a parcel. I baked them for 45 minutes and they were practically liquid inside. Just perfect with custard.

Really delicious, and easy to tweak! I used mixed dried berries (cranberry, cherry, blueberry) plus raisins and walnuts. I cored the apples, cut them in half, filled with fruit and nuts, and then drizzled the butter and sugar mixture over it all. Like everyone else says, it took about 1 hour to get the apples really soft, but I was prepared after reading the comments. Everyone loved the orange zest!

It's recipes like these that make the kickoff into cold weather worth it.  I didn't use walnuts or raisins - used maple syrup in addition to just a little brown sugar.  Threw in a few pear slices too...why not?

This was great! I used granny smiths and omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any on hand) I cooked them for about an hour since the hubby wanted them soft, but they would have been fine after about 40 min. I will definately do this again!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly (no nuts, raisins, and zest) because it was a spontaneous addition to our meal as I had four apples that needed to be eaten. I personally don't care for cooked fruit but these were delcious. My three boys (5 yr old and twin 3 yr olds) loved them! I spooned them over a bed of multi-grain oatmeal. Next time I'll add the zest but no nuts as one of my sons is allergic.  I do have to agree with others that you have to cook the apples longer than 30mins. Enjoy!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked the apples for about 50 minutes and added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. They turned out perfectly, my husband and I both loved them. I will definitely be making these again!

While this is not the first time I've baked with apples, this is the first time I've stuffed them and baked them whole. I wish I would've read the reviews, because then I would've enjoyed it more. Next time I'll definitely use foil to help soften the apples sooner! The only things I changed about the recipe was using 3 small apples instead of 2, almonds rather than walnuts, and I didn't have an orange to zest... I ended up taking them out at 30 minutes, cutting them up, and baking them an additional 10 minutes at 375. Not a good idea because that obviously dried them out. Good to know for next time. I will attempt this again with the said changes!

I left out the orange peel but it came out great!  Add some vanilla ice cream and your good to go.  As others have said, the apple is soft if you let it cook for 50 minutes instead of what the recipe mentions.  Thanks!

I omitted the nuts due to a nut allergy and had no problem with baking time. I had them in a hotter oven with other food and after about 25 minutes turned off the heat and kept them in the hot oven until we were ready for dessert. They were perfect.

This recipe turned out pretty good. I would have liked a little crumb topping, but that is me and not really a baked apple recipe thing. :) Hubby really liked them as well. I did cook about 10-15 min longer. Used the foil the first 20-25 min. Also omited raisins and nuts, since hubby is allergic to nuts and doesn't care for raisins. The sauce turned out great, I kept dipping my apple in it.

The apples were good but the time the recipe had down was way off. I had to cook my apples for 45 minutes and even then they could have used some more time. Next time a make this I will cook it a little longer.
