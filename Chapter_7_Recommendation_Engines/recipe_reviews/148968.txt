Great for breakfast. I used fresh blueberries and left out the additional spices, but added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. I topped it with a dollup of fat free vanilla yogurt - very filling.

Quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had! The spice addict that I am, I put in a bit too much turmeric, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. Will definitely be making this again.

Had the potential to be 5 STAR.... but the turmeric was overpowering.  I would cut it in half and double the cinnamon.  I also added 1/2 a banana and it was yummy!

Really good oatmeal. Filling and flavorful. I didn't have blueberries so I left that part out. I made no other changes. Next time, I'll be sure to have them on hand. Very, very good. I floated 
milk on the top because that's always how I grew up eating oatmeal.

Great recipe! I used apple juice because I didn't have any OJ. I increased slightly the turmeric and ginger (they both offer great health benefits) and I added a tablespoon of flaxseed. I cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave and I added honey to sweeten.

Very good - a nice change, with the spices.  I added just a few grates of orange zest, since I used a fresh orange for the juice, and I think I might have reduced the turmeric slightly as I wasn't so sure it was for me, so I'd say I used 1/8 tsp.  I can detect it, but it's not overpowering at all, so that was a good decision for my tastebuds!  I also added the orange juice before microwaving (didn't read through recipe entirely before starting) but it was fine - I ended up cooking for more like 3 1/2 minutes.  I like the flavors, but I did need to add a little drizzle of honey for sweetness.  Makes one nice big serving or two smaller ones if you're serving a little extra fruit or yogurt for breakfast.  Thanks for sharing, Leah!

I needed something different than regular oatmeal with brown sugar.  So, this was really tasty!  I like using the blueberries (I had fresh) and adding the spices.  I served it up with a smoothie for a very filling breakfast!

This was okay, I thought the orange juice made it too sour but I like the idea so I'll be playing around with it until I can get the flavors just right.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Instead of the microwave, I use the double boiler. For added protein I add either walnuts or pecans.

Pretty good, I'm not sure I liked the orange juice since it made the oatmeal a little sour.  I doubled it and cooked it on the stove for hubby and me.  I'm not very adventurous in the morning, so I didn't use the turmeric.  I stirred in some raw honey to sweeten it up a bit.

It is nice to switch things up a bit with oatmeal. I never thought of using frozen blueberries and orange juice to add a little tanginess, but it was nice. The spices are delightful. I would probably have given it 5 stars if it had nuts. It needs crunch so I now make mine in bulk on stovetop with whole almonds added first. (I also prefer old fashion, but whatever floats your boat) Coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans is good as well.

This was pretty good. I added the turmeric but not sure it made a difference. I would leave out the orange juice next time as it made it too tart.

This was very good.  I did make it on the stove top instead of the microwave, but it had great flavor and is a great variance on regular old oatmeal.

This was.....interesting. The combination of blueberries and orange juice made it very sour. Turmeric is such a strong spice that I only used 1/8 teaspoon. Probably wouldn't make this again.

I was lucky enough to have read a lot of reviews of this recipe, and pretty much assumed that it was going to be in need of some sweetner to counter the effect of the OJ.  I tasted a tiny bit, and then added about a teaspoon of brown sugar.  That was the trick, and I enjoyed this for breakfast.  I also used fresh blueberries instead of frozen.

This was very tart, too tart. Perhaps just a scoop of frozen concentrated orange juice instead. Something is needed to counter the sour taste of the orange juice. Or maybe apple juice instead. Not sure about the turmeric. I could not detect it.

Very tasty but I added 1 packet of Equal to make a little sweeter. Did not use OJ but added a touch of milk. Did not try the tumeric as the other reviewers did not seem to care for the flavor.

Very good - I made it on the stove and substituted chopped apples for blueberries, and it was delicious.  My son didn't like it, though, as I think the spices were too strong - but great for me!

I thought this was spiced nicely with the turmeric, and I added extra cinnamon and extra ginger. My orange juice and blueberries were nicely sweetened, and I didn't need to add a sweetner. With all the fruit and large serving of oatmeal, this made two servings for me. This is a great spice combo I will use again in oatmeal.

Very satisfying breakfast! The portion easily serves two. To give some extra crunch I added a handful of chopped pecans. And I served it with half and half and brown sugar added to taste.  Although I was unsure of putting turmeric in my oatmeal, it gave a nice subtle spice flavor along with the ginger. Will definitely try again!

At first I was wondering how I could possibly have oatmeal without milk & like it. (Haha!) I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I used fresh instead of frozen blueberries and dried unsweetened dark sweet cherries (from Trader Joe's)  instead of cranberries . I also used 1/2 of a freshly squeezed orange. I added a few drops of vanilla and about a tsp maple syrup. Yum! I didn't have any ginger but I imagine that it would have been a great addition.

I omitted the blueberries and turmeric as I didn't have any, and the ginger because I'm not a big fan.  Very tasty!  You may want to add a little sugar to it.

Yummy!  The only frozen fruit I had was a frozen cherry medley, but that worked fine.  I doubled the cinnamon and went with about 1/8 tsp of turmeric.  Ended up using about 1/8 cup or orange juice as well.  Very flavorful and warming.

I made it the night before and warmed it up in the morning. I absolutely loved this dish. I am trying to stay away from foods that have added sugar so I substituted the dried cranberries (they add sugar to the ones I found) with currants and golden raisins. I also added nuts after I had cooked the oatmeal.
This is a great and easy substitute for the pre-packaged oatmeal I had been eating.

Hubby said to give a 2 stars, I would've 1 only. He said it was a good idea, but something just wasn't right. He finally added a tish of brown sugar, but I still thought it was over powering in something. I don't know if it was a spice or having o.j. over it.  I'll still to my oatmeal with cranberries or blueberries in it with milk.

Orange Juice makes the oatmeal sweet because orange juice has a lot of sugar content. I do not drink orange juice on the Daniel fast because of sugar content.  A fresh orange squeezing the juice from it may have been better.

Some of the tastes didn't ring well with me. Plus I really did not feel full afterwards.  If I make it again, I would add some walnuts and pecans.
