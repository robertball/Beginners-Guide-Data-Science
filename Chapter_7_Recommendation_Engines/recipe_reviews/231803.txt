Used flour tortillas, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, and countryside bbq sauce. It was perfect.  I will be making this again for my family.

Delicious, fast and easy. I even made a BBQ ranch sauce to drizzle over the top. I'll be keeping this recipe and using again for sure.

I made this for my son as a quick lunch and he really liked it.  I loved how super easy and quick it was.  I had a deli rotisserie chicken and had everything else on had to make this. A simple but yummy meal that I would make again!

I'm 3 months post bariatric sleeve surgery, so I needed to make a few changes to the recipes to reduce my sugar intake. low carb tortilla (5g carb & 5g protein), sugar free bbq sauce and I didn't have red onions... but it was yummy. My teen daughter loved it!

My husband was bummed when I didn't make more than 2. I used the flat tortillas you buy in the freezer section at Costco. Put them in the oven at 400 and take them out a couple min later after they puff up like a pillow so they are semi cooked and flexible enough to flatten to put your pizza toppings on. Those (white flour) tortillas are only 140 calories each.

I didn't have fresh veggies or fresh herbs so I used canned spices. Also replaced with swiss and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and a quick lunch for a busy student.

I bought all of the ingredients that I didn't have intending to make this recipe then got home and realized I didn't have any BBQ sauce. As a result, I used ranch as the sauce instead and it turned out fantastic! I also added some chopped green onions because I needed to use them up.

BBQ Chicken Tortilla Pizza Haiku: "We weren't too thrilled. Earns stars for ease of making, but taste was so-so." Followed recipe exactly and these tortilla "pizzas" while super-easy to put together, but weren't outstanding b/c WW tortilla's don't tend to crisp on their own w/ all those ingredients on top, so we had to kinda scoop, half eat w/ forks. Maybe putting the same ingredients onto pizza crust or an English muffin; not sure, but it was fun to try!

So much better on a tortilla than a dough-y crust! I added diced pepperocini for extra kick and used Famous Dave's Sweet &  Zesty bbq sauce. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

Well I totally had to cobble this together using what I had:  jalapeno/cheddar wrap, chipotle BBQ sauce, and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella ... but it was DELICIOUS!  I baked mine for 7 minutes and wish I had left it in longer as it wasn't crispy on the bottom; but I simply folded and devoured it just the same.  I was a little hesitant to put the cilantro on but am so glad I did.  It gave just the right kick.  Thank you so much for recipe!

Made it as directed in the recipe, kiddos gobbled it up and hubby gave it a thumbs up.!

The only thing I DID change was the method of cooking. I found that cooking the tortillas on a pizza pan or cookie sheet did not allow for the tortillas to crisp up as I thought they would. They remained fairly soft and for quite awhile, while the toppings cooked away. Fearful that they would burn before they could crisp up in the oven, I removed them from the oven and placed them on a grilled pan on the top of the over. Wa-la! Crispy and delicious in about 3 minutes.

In  hindsight, I would say I could probably have avoided the oven altogether and started with the griddle pan, or if I had a convection oven perhaps it wouldnt have taken them as long to crisp up.

Either way, this is a solidly simple, yet satisfying recipe. It will definitely go in the dinner rotation!

This tasted great! I used a low carb white flour tortilla (my preference) and then instead of baking in the oven, used my stove top griddle (drizzled a little oil to help crisp tortilla) and covered with a lid to heat thoroughly. I'm single so this was perfect for one person to make one at a time and eat throughout the week!

I loved the ease of making this and the taste. Of course, you have to like BBQ sauce on your pizza; if not, don't even try this recipe. It's a very forgiving recipe: I used white onion instead of red, and I added red bell pepper since I like it and wanted it for color. I did find that 4 oz. of chicken was too much for just one pizza. I will definitely make this again!

This will be a regular for me. Made a couple changes for personal preference. Bake the chx with spice rub and chx stock till done. Chop and top tortilla with bbq sauce(cowtown our fav), chopped chx, red onion, Italian seasoning and pepper jack cheese. Bake for 10-12 min. Perfect!

I didn't have any cilantro, but I did add a few small slices of avocado.  I made it in the toaster oven...heating up the tortilla for a few minutes before adding everything and baking the rest of the way.  It turned out perfect and it was delicious!
