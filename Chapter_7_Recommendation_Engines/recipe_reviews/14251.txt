This stuff is very addictive, with a few minor modifications.  First, I highly recommend that you puree the cottage cheese in the blender or a food processor.  Second, drain the fruit very well.  Third, only use one 8 oz. container of Cool Whip.  And finally, refrigerate for several hours for it to set up properly.  The result is smooth, rich, orange perfection :-)

This is a very refreshing recipe that I have made for years with some slight variations:  Strawberry or Strawberry/Banana jello with drained pineapple tidbits, or another very nice combination is using lime jello with the pineapple. The combinations are endless.  I've even added chopped nuts and marshmallows.  In all my combinations, though, I've always only needed 1 box of jello instead of 2.

I've loved this salad for years! It's a refreshing snack and/or a great alternative to breakfast cereal. However, I only use one small package of sugar-free jello and I often eliminate the whipped topping altogether which cuts down the calories. Personally, I also prefer the consistency when made with large curd cottage cheese simply because it's more identifiable and doesn't get lost in the mixture. Makes about 12 half cup servings (without the whipped topping).

I made this for a baby shower and it was a split reaction.  People were asking what the chunks were and some cringed when I said cottage cheese.  I admit, I didn't drain the pineapple and I should have.  I thought the taste was great but it was too runny.  To stiffen it up, I added coconut and it tasted even better.  Next time, I will drain the cottage cheese and the pineapple along with the oranges.

This is such a tasty and refreshing dessert.  A nice change from regular fruit salads.  I use fat free cottage cheese and apricot flavored gelatin when I can find it.  My 4 year old enjoys this as well (and he's picky).  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. Only change we made was to cut the jello down to one box instead of two. Thanks for sharing.

LOL it says to stir until well blended (not put in mixer or blender!).  Its not fair to rate this recipe low because people cannot follow directions.  Its a great recipe!

I pureed the cottage cheese in my blender first. I used only 1 box of lemon gelatin and drained fruit cocktail.  Can't stand it made with lumpy cottage cheese. Ughh

Wonderful, tasty, light desert.  I did, however make some changes.  I used 1 can of mandarin oranges, 1 can of peaches and 1 can of pineapple tidbits.  I drained the fruit and then mashed it with a potato masher.  I also pureed the cottage cheese in the blinder.  I followed the rest of the recipe and to make it look pretty I topped it with pineapple rings and placed cherries in the center.  It looked and tasted wonderful.  I will make this again and again and again.  A big hit, everyone loved it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My grandmother has been making this for years.  A few tricks: use small curd cottage cheese and ALWAYS make it the night before and let it sit.  We have it every holiday or get together.

It is exactly like a creamsicle!  I drained all of the fruit and only used half of the required cottage cheese.  Then, I added some mini marshmallows.

My grandma used to make this all the time for us when we would come over for a visit.  To make a small batch I use 3 oz. orange jello, small can crushed pineapple well drained(roughly the same size as a tuna can), 6.1 oz can mandarin oranges well drained, 16 oz. cottage cheese and and 8 oz. tub cool whip.  It's one of my favorite recipes!  Definitely a hit with my husband and children.

We really liked this recipe but I think next time I will reduce the amount of whipped topping, and add some more cottage cheese, since this seems to be the only way my children will eat cottage cheese. Thanks D!

A fun, easy recipe.  I made it as written, except I added about 1 cup of mini marshmallows.  It's a great balance of sweet, with a little tang from the cottage cheese.  The texture of the cottage cheese did not bother me at all - it really blends in.  I took it to my book club and no one guessed there was cottage cheese in the recipe.  A few tips - mix in a BIG bowl.  The whipped topping goes down a little in volume as you stir, but it takes a big bowl to have enough room to mix.  Also, it does not keep very well.  After 3-4 days, the texture is not quite the same and liquid begins to separate. Try to finish it all in a day or two.

Love the mandarin oranges in this! The recipe makes a large amount (I guess for around 10), so it's perfect for a potluck, and not difficult to halve for our family of 4!  Thanks for sharing!

this was just okay.  my husband didn't like it, but i didn't expect him to love it anyway. (not a big cottage cheese fan).  my sixteen month old really liked it, but since he eats cottage cheese with pineapple in it already, i can't really justify all of the added sugar.  i reduced the amount of jello by almost half and it still tasted very sugary.  not a bad recipe, but i probably won't make it again.

Extremely simple, very quick and tasty too. 
I wanted to substitute with strawberries but figured I should make it as instructed the first time.
Glad I did too.  Oranges are perfect this time of year.

Will be making this again soon.

This is a family pleasing side dish that is quick to make.  I halved the ingredients and it made 6 servings.  It is also good with shredded cheddar cheese and pecans added.  You can't taste the cottage cheese (especially if you add cheddar too), so it is "safe" to try on your family members that don't like cottage cheese.

Really tasty and refreshing.  I used sugar-free gelatin and "light" whipped topping and it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I might add a squeeze of lemon juice and maybe some coconut or toasted nuts.  Everyone raved about it, especially the family diabetics.

I think this would be better with pineapple chunks instead of crushed. The crushed makes the consistancy gritty. Other wise it's pretty tasty.

This is what relatives beg us to make for holidays, although my wife calls it ambrosia.  Follow directions to the letter and don't change a thing if you're trying it for the first time, though we use sugar free jello.  Use both boxes for full flavor.

This was very good.  My husband, who does not like cottage cheese, did not care for this recipe.  But I liked it, and wouldn't change a thing.  I made sure I drained the pineapple VERY well, and the fluff lasted a couple days before it started breaking down.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sounded better than it turned out. Like someone else said, it made a HUGE quantity. It tasted good on the first day; the next day it looked so awful I ended up pitching it.

Thank you for posting this.  Me and my mom could not find her recipe for orange fluff and though the ingredients are so simple i could not remember the measurements.  When making this i make sure and drain my pineapple through a fine sieve and push most of the liquid out.  It may seem very dry but this helps make the fluff firmer.  There is liquid in the cottage cheese that moistens the dessert and makes it taste so good.  This is such a hit at summer picnics and potlucks.  I never bring any of this home when i take it somewhere.  I think it tastes even better than a creamsicle.  
Thanks for posting D =)

I thought this was really tasty and a blast from the past.  My kids wouldn't eat it though, which really surprised me.  I think it was the texture of the cottage cheese.

I was delighted to find this recipe here.  I had lost mine from many years ago.  I made this again tonight and I found I did not have enough of any one flavor jello so I substitued 1 container of Raspberry Ice drink mix (enough for 1/2 gal., made by Crystal Lite).  This is fabulous for hot summer night treats.

Very easy. I blend the cottage cheese in a blender until smooth and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I've made it using both 1 pkg and 2 pkgs of orange Jello and there were no left overs nor any complaints. :) I've even added 1/2 of a pkg of cream cheese blended with cottage cheese.

This is a great basic recipe. Had I made the recipe as written, I probably would've given it 3 stars due to oversweetness. The changes  I made were that I used just 1 (3 oz) package of orange Jello and just 8 oz (not 16 oz) of Light Cool Whip. With the changes, the orange flavor and sweetness were just right and not overpowering. In addition, I added 1/4 cup of unsweetened coconut and 1/3 cup of chopped pecans. I used small curd cottage cheese, and I really smushed the crushed pineapple in order to remove as much juice as possible. Just a note: if you add pecans, wait to add them just before serving, otherwise they'll get kinda soft and lose their crunch. This recipe needs to be finished off within a couple days, otherwise it gets watery. I love it, my husband likes it, and my 2 teens, though they like the flavor, don't like the cottage cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good. I made it for a family bbque and everyone loved it. I did put the cottage cheese through a blender first and squeezed all the juice from the oranges and pineapple. It withstood the ninety degree heat. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for a family dinner at my in-laws.  I added sliced strawberries and doubled the recipe for our large clan.  Many of my sister-in-laws asked for the recipe.  They were surprised to know that it contained cottage cheese, because many in the family don't like cottage cheese!  I took the advice of other raters and pureed the cottage cheese, making a smooth fluffy consistancy.  I will definitely use this again, maybe change the flavor of gelatin and the fruit to make something different every time.  I loved this super easy salad!

I thought this had a really good flavor but most people including myself found the texture disgusting. It made a huge bowl, and I came home with more than 2/3s of it left. I will probably not make this again

Just what I was looking for!  Yummy and easy!  I think I may use just a 12 oz cool whip and maybe add some chopped pecans next time...but, it is great as is too!  Thanks for an easy, low fat recipe!!

Simple and easy, and tasty, too.  This worked well for a fall dinner at church.

This recipe was only so-so and it made a ton!  I think maybe part of the problem was I used small-curd cottage cheese and it just got kinda of lost in the cool whip pineapple.  I think if I made it again I would put in some more mandarin oranges and a little less cool whip...the fluff part took over the other ingredients.

Everyone at the party loved it and wanted the recipe. Although I only used 1 can of mandarin oranges and 1 pkg of gelatin (per my printout) it was still was very good and easy to make.  It did get a little stiff after sitting, but if actually used 2 can of oranges, I'm sure it would be just right.

This orange gelatin salad was extremely easy to make, even in very large quantites.  My husband loved it so much, he ate it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks until it was gone.  The party I made it for absolutely loved it and everyone was asking for the recipe!!

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  I came up with it on a whim (great minds think alike).  I don't use pineapple though, instead I add miniture marshmallows.  Yum, yum, yum!

I too, pureed the cottage cheese.  I thought only 1 box of jello and 8 oz. whipped topping were necessary; it's a salad- I didn't think it needed to be overly sweet!  Just sweet enough.

Great!!!  You can also use sugar-free jello and sugar free Cool Whip and it's just as wonderful.

My grandmother made this when I was a child and I loved it, so I was thrilled when I found the recipe on here.  It's brought back very fond memories for me.  The only thing I change is to blend the cottage cheese in a small food processor before hand, to get rid of the lumpy texture (but that may not bother some people).  A very tasty treat for a warm summer day :)

Quick and easy for dinner and not too sweet, although you want to eat it up quick--by the third night it starts getting watery.  It makes a lot!  Still good with sugar-free jello and low-fat cool whip, and low-fat cottage cheese to cut down on the calories a bit.

I thought the consistency would have been thicker. Nonetheless, it was wonderful and very refreshing as it was made for my daughter's 2nd birthday party on a 90 degree day.

Made this for my family's 4th of July cookout. Everyone but my son, who does not like pinapple, loved it!  Great success, and everyone wanted the recipe.  Very easy to make, only had a small problem draining the pinapple well but I didn't have a problem with the dish being "watery".

This is so YUMMY!!! I made it twice, the second time I used chunk pineapple,
because I couldn't drain the crushed enough and the salad was a little watery. 
Everyone gobbled it up, and it was a cinch to make.

The first time I made this salad, I was not too crazy about the texture of the cottage cheese, so I decided to make it differently the next time.  I put the cottage cheese in a bowl, along with the dry jello, and beat both together with a hand mixer until the cottage cheese was a smooth consistency.  I then added half of the (well drained) mandarine oranges and pineapple and beat those in too, chopping them up into smaller pieces (this helps spread the fruit throughout the jello salad).  I took the remaining fruit and chopped the pieces in half and folded them in the jello mixture along with the cool whip.  A little bit more work, but worth the effort!

I think the unit of measures are wrong on this. I used 1 6 oz box of Jello instead of 2 3 oz. And I had to buy 2 8 oz tubes of cool whip to make up the 1 16 oz. I didnt even use all of the second one and I think the orange flavor was barely there. It was good though, however for sure doing coconut next time. That would make it even better!

This is very good. I have also used other flavors of gelatin and other fruits. One good one was raspberry gelatin with diced canned peaches and crushed pineapple - it tasted like a peach melba.

This recipe is great!! Very easy to put together, made it the night before Thanksgiving.  I think next time I will add some walnuts or pecans.  I used black cherry jell-o because it's what I had on hand and it turned into a pretty pink fluff that everyone liked, including my husband who is not a cottage cheese fan.

Nice light orange creamcicle taste. I used the suggestions made by others. I pureed the cottage cheese, drained the fruits VERY well, and decreased the amount of cottage cheese and orange gelatin. It turned out nice and fluffy. I think these would look more visually appealing if they were served in parfait glasses, with alternating layers of mandarin oranges.

I have had this recipe in my family for years.  The only hanges we ever make were to add a box of Cream cheese cut into tiny bits.  This helps it set up faster and tastes great!  I do also use large curd cottage cheese.  Yummy.

Always a light dessert favorite at picnics and casual dinners!  Also good when you use mandarin oranges and frozen raspberries with rapberry jello mix.  Just a good basic recipe that everyone can tinker with.

I used this at my wedding as a side dish on the buffet line.  It goes a long way and we found it froze well. In calculating the recipe for 150 people we realized you don't need to use so much whipped cream. But, overall it was a big hit!

I love this light and fluffy fruit salad! It was so easy to make! I could not get my 3 kids to eat it though because of the cottage cheese texture.  My extended family couldn't get enough of it!!!

Even after putting the cottage cheese in my Ninja and pulverising it, this dish still had a "starchy" consistency (best way I can describe it).  Good start, but now I'm on the lookout for an orange fluff recipe w/o the cottage cheese.

Great and light tasting!  I had to use 2 15oz cans of mandarin oranges (saved 1/2 dz chunks to eat and 1 20oz can pineapple chunks - couldn't find crushed so saved a few chunks to eat later!  We enjoyed this alot.

Yum!  I've had this before but never made it myself.  What a fabulous healthy way to get in some good ol' cottage cheese!  I used 16oz fat free cottage cheese, 1 box of sugar-free/fat-free strawberry jello mix, 1 can of diced mandarin oranges (drained) and some fat-free cool whip.  I would have used pineapple but didn't have any.  This is as quick and easy as it gets and tasted great!  Perfect healthy treat for the kids on a hot summer day.  I don't know if it tastes better after it's chilled awhile but it tasted delicious immediately after I made it -which is a big plus!  I don't think this is anything fancy for company or anything but it's great to have in the fridge for a sweet treat!

I love this recipe!  I changed the flavor of the Jello from orange to peach and WOW!  Just like my Mom used to make!  The only thing I did was as others had suggested cut back the Jello a bit since 2 seemed like an awful lot.  Great and will be making it again for sure.

Great recipe!  I followed it as written and loved it.  Only thing I might try differently next time is to only use 1 box of jello.  After it sat in the frige for a day the jello kind of took it over.  Other than that, excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

Not very good, I blended the cottage cheese but could still taste it. This was edible but I definately won't be making it again. Also, I suggest dropping the jello down to one package.

This receipe is the bomb, quick and easy!  Great to make the evening prior to an event...doesn't take but 10 minutes to make!  The Cottage Cheese give it a unique texture.  Even my kids love it and they don't like cottage cheese...great way to hide it!

This was pretty good. I made it with ricotta instead of cottage cheese, because of the texture.  The ricotta made it a little grainy, but not lumpy.

Overall not a bad recipe.  First, kids definitely did not liked the lumpy cottage cheese.  Will blend next time.  Second, This recipe does make quite a bit.  So I put some of the remaining balance into small popsicle containers, WOW, these are great frozen.  Next time I make this recipe, I will definitely serve it as a frozen dessert.

I made this for a Bunco party because I wanted to be the first to serve "Jello" with the meal...why?  I guess because it's All-American-Down-Home-Cooking and I was serving pot Roast (the awesome crockpot kind from this site) and new potatoes.  It isn't a surprise that everyone loves Jello and a few people asked me for the recipe.  I guess if you don't like cottage cheese you won't like it but otherwise it's great...and so easy to whip up.

This sounded great, but tasted horrible.  It seemed like there was too much dry orange gelatin mix in it.  Texture was hard to handle as well.  Will not make this again. All three kids couldn't make it past a couple of bites

This is a fun, tasty little dish. My mother's version uses one box of raspberry Jello, rather than the orange (though I imagine orange would be yummy too). Actually, we refer to the dish as "The Pink Stuff" for this reason. She also includes a 1/2 cup- 1 cup or so of small marshmallows. I agree with the other reviews that it is important to drain the fruit well.

Very tasty! This is my first time making the “orange fluff”. I made along side of Watergate salad for my family reunion. I think it’s a good paring.

My family has made this for years, we love it! One key item is using the SMALL curd cottage cheese, it makes a huge difference in the texture. We only use 1 - three ounce box of jello.

I've been making this for years.  It's always a must have for any family holiday.  My recipe calls for orange jello, crushed pineapple with juice, cream cheese, cottage cheese, cool whip and pecan pieces.  It's lovely!

My family loves this.  I use one orange and one pineapple 3 oz each for the gelatin.  I also like to have the cottage cheese smooth, but if you just dump it all in a bowl and mix, the lumps of the cottage cheese mix in with the lumps of the fruit.
This is the only way my husband will eat cottage cheese.

The only change I made was omitting the pineapples due to an allergy.  Otherwise, it was deliscious!  Definitely will be making it again.

Easy and adaptable!  I've made this many, many times.  I've altered amounts of fruit, cottage cheese, and coolwhip.  I usually use 1 large or 2 small cans of mandarin oranges and a large can of pineapple tidbits -all well drained.  Today I used the large 24 oz cottage cheese....I like the added protein.  I usually use 1% or fat free.  I use 1 box of jello but if it doesn't taste sweet or "orangey" enough I add another 1/2 or full box.   If I use less cottage cheese, I don't use the whole amount of coolwhip as it is too sweet for me.  I don't care for added marshmallows , but have thrown in some halved grapes or some chopped pecans or walnuts.  It is so easy to throw together, you can experiment with other flavors of dry jello and fruit combos.  Enjoy??

There are certain recipes that taste like childhood. This is one of them. I grew up with this stuff, and where I grew up it was common to see this as part of the spread for holiday celebrations. There is no need to drain the pineapple or cottage cheese. But I don't think you need all the cool whip called for. I use half the amount and it's perfect. And orange fluff is not orange fluff without colored marshmallows! The addition of shredded coconut, and chopped pecans is recommended as well. And if you want to try some real decadence, try adding some torn up angel food cake for a yummy dessert. I use sugar free jello and lite cool whip with great results. I was raised on this, and now I raise my kids on this.

I've made this several times.  I use sugar free orange jello, low fat cottage cheese and light cool whip.  It's a really light salad to eat and somewhat healthy using the altered recipe I use.

I make this for a lot of summer holidays.  Reminds me of an orange creamsicle.  I use light cool whip and sugar fee jello to cut the fat and calories down a little.  I get an extra can of mandarin oranges to make a pretty design on top.  I do like this chilled overnight and then the texture is firm and not as gloppy.  I also do not take it to potluck dinners when it is very hot because it gets watery when it melts.

I use small curd cottage cheese and do mash it a bit.  I also drain the pineapple and add to the cottage cheese first, then blend in the orange gelatin along with the drained mandarin oranges then fold in the whipped topping with a half bag of mini marshmallows.  The marshmallows puff up and add another dimension to the fluff...ummm good!

Reminds me of my grandmother's orange salad she made around the holidays. I make it exactly as written. Very good stuff!  I have also added a couple cups of mini marshmallows to it and that was also good. Either way this is a really yummy dish.

I was so hyped to try this recipe and only give it two stars. The cottage cheese texture did not fit in with this recipe. The rest of the ingredients had a smooth texture and eating this really disappointed me and my family. Next time I will try sour cream.

Fell in love with orange fluff as a kid when my grandmother made it for us!  Kids usually love it.  I don't always use an entire container of cottage cheese and I often will use extra cool whip and I always drain the crushed pineapple.  I also use the sugar free jello sometimes.  You can modify this to taste and no matter what, it is always yummy.  Great as a summer side dish, but we enjoy it year round.

For this recipe put the cottage cheese in the blender and blend until smooth then add the dry jello, blend until dissolved, about a minute.  Mix in the whip cream then the oranges.  I don't use pineapple but add at the end if you do.  This is rich and smooth and tastes like orange sherbet.

It didnt specify large curd cottage cheese so I used  small curd and it felt like gravel on your tongue.  It also was way too stiff.  It should have called for UNDRAINED fruit.  The jello needed some liquid, which would make the salad a much nicer consistency.

I have been making this recipe for many years, didn't know it was actually a recipe on the internet (lol). I mix the dry orange jello (sugar free for my aunt and dad who are diabetic...in a separate container) into the cottage cheese and mix real well first. Then I add the cool whip so it is very smooth, then add the mandarin oranges. Some people love the mini marshmallows in it so I always make sure I bring a bag with me so they can add themselves if they want to (but I never put them in the desert). What a great idea to puree the cottage cheese beforehand (I like cottage cheese by itself, but in this desert I have always thought it a little too chunky myself). Great tip! thanks
