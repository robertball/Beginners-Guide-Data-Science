Super easy, super yummy. I too made adjustments based on what I had in my kitchen: Rotel canned tomatoes, no carrots (didn't realize I was out of them!!), Red kidney beans, a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, shells instead of ditalini, and added green onions and shredded chicken. SO GOOD!! I love how adaptable this recipe is :)

My mom and I found this recipe and made it.  It was SO good, we made it again a day later.  This soup tastes restaurant quality and has the perfect flavor! No alterations needed.  Yum!

This was very good soup. I doubled the recipe since there  five of us and we like to have leftovers for lunch the next day. Worked out well. Served it with warm french rolls and we were all happy. Very easy to throw together too. Thanks Campbell's.

I gave this 5 stars only because this recipe is easy to customize based on what you already have.  It's a flexible recipe that will be good even if you don't follow the exact measurements.  I didn't have everything, so here is how I customized it.  If you don't have Italian seasoning, you can instead use equal parts of basil, marjoram, oregano, rosemary and thyme.  I didn't have rosemary but had all the others.  I used 14.5 oz can chicken broth plus a little water since I didn't have 2 cups.  I had a can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno's so I used that to make it nice and spicy!  Finally, I used fresh cooked red kidney beans which is the reason I tried the recipe in the first place.  A good recipe for using up left over veggies.

MADE THIS AND MY FAMILY LOVED IT. I ADDED EXTRA BROTH BECAUSE IT CAME OUT TOO THICK. EASY RECIPE TO FOLLOW AND COMES OUT VERY TASTY. THE MACARONI ABSORBS THE LIQUID SO I COOKED IT SEPERATELY BEFORE ADDING. THE GRANDKIDS LOVED IT SERVED WITH WARM ITALIAN BREAD

I come from an Italian family and we LOVE this recipe! I use Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and add only half a tsp of Italian seasoning.

Family all enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have carrots so substituted bell pepper. I also forgot the final step of blending half the mixture. It has very good flavor.

I didn't have any problem with the way this tasted. I actually liked how hearty it was. The flavor was pretty good and even better with the shaved parmesan I put on top of my bowl. However, it took way longer than 45 minutes! To soften the vegetables it did take a good 15 minutes. I did keep the burner on medium, or setting 5 on my stove, so they did not burn. I did really like how many fresh vegetables were in it to. I used shell noodles and I microwaved them to save some time, which worked fine. With all the time spent though, I was kind of dissapointed in the only 3 average servings. I would definitely double it.

Easy and delicious. Sometimes we add one or two tempered eggs, spinach, and some parmasean cheese to make it a little heartier.

This is a very easy soup to make and delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe was written but next time I will reduce the amount of Italian seasoning. It overwhelmed the other flavors. I might also add even more beans.
Update: Had the leftover soup today and it is even better the second day! I will definitely make it again.

Not even close to Olive Garden's Pasta E Fagoli. Lacks a lot of key ingredients: like seasoning, meat and sauce, making it EXTREMELY bland. Plus the directions were a little screwy near the end. I made it work.

Iâ€™ve made this before following the directions. It was a little thicker then we like. So this time I skipped the blending step and it came out just the way we like it!

Made it as written but used red beans (all I had at the moment) instead of white.  Loved it, but more importantly, my finicky husband loved it.  Will plan on making double recipe from now on as someone suggested.

Very easy and healthy soup, but I didn't love it so likely will not make again.  I feel the beans need more than 5 minutes, so they soften more.  Not sure what else was missing for me, just not my taste, I guess.

LOVED this, though I did it a little differently. sauteed onions and lots of carrots,  browned chicken pieces (after sprinkling with Italian seasoning), added white kidney beans and large can of tomatoes.  I let this boil then added pasta and cooked a la dente.   put into casserole dish with parm cheese on top and baked until cheese melted.

Terrific. Changes. I added frozen corn, 8 oz of elbow mac (that's all I had), petite diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I cooked the garlic separatly in olive oil and deglazed with the blender mixture. I pan fried in olive oil 2-3 chicken breasts coated with McCormick "Perfect Pinch" Vegetable Seasoning. Once the chicken was cooked I shreaded it and added it to the final mixture (I pan fried the shreaded chicken another couple of minutes before adding). I also added 1 tsp of the vegetable seasoning to the blender mixture when deglazing the garlic.  I finished off the dish with 5 oz. of frozed chopped spinach.  I went heavy on the vegetables and this made way more the 4 servings.  I also ended up using about 4 cups of chicken broth.  5 stars by all who enjoyed.

Very good as written.  My family enjoyed it.  Quite hearty.
