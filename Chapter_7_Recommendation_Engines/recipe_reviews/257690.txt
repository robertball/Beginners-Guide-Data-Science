I created this recipe after my disappointment of finally tasting the theme park version. With so much hype about it, I was found the theme park version too pineapple-y. I imagined a perfect balance between smooth and creamy soft serve and pineapple. When it didn't live up to my expectations, I created what I originally imagined it to be! This recipe is easy to make. The soft serve ice cream is creamy, balanced with the taste of pineapple. We love making these into float but pouring pineapple juice over a scoop or two of pineapple whip and serving with a dollop of fresh whipped cream on top.

4.10.17  Really tasty, creamy homemade pineapple ice cream.  Quick and easy to make with texture similar to soft-serve.  Not too sweet, with the pineapple flavor the star!
