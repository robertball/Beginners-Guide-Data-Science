I absolutely loved this recipe!!  I had to change a couple of things... didnt have Worsteshire (sp?) sauce so I substituted it with Soy Sauce and I didnt have dried mustard so I used regular mustard but doubled it.  I couldnt stop eating... as it sat on the counter to cool, I kept going out and taking a spoonfulls of sauce cause I couldnt get over how good it tasted.  I have left overs for tonight... and next time I go to the store, I am buying the ribs again so I can make them for my sister to try.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!!

I love country ribs and was looking for something besides barbeque sauce for them.  We really enjoyed this and it doesn't get easier than the crockpot.  I didn't have a boullion cube, so I used a cup of beef broth instead of the boullion and water.  I used 1 TBSP yellow mustard (didn't have the powder).  I cooked all day (about 10 hours) on low.  I thickened with 2 TBSP cornstarch and a little water and served with rice.  Adding this to the rotation!

This was a great recipe.  The ribs were tender and had a nice flavor.  I liked how easy it was to prepare.  Instead of cooking on high for an hour and low for 2-3 more, I just cooked on low for 8 hours and the results were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this 4 times already. The only thing I changed was omitting the water and boullion cube. Instead I added a can of beef broth. The house smells wonderful when this is cooking!   I wanted to add, I've been making this using a 3 lb rib end roast instead of the country style ribs. The meat shreds easily and is delicious. I store the leftovers in the fridge without the extra gravy/sauce. When reheating, I just pour barbecue sauce on it for some good pulled pork sandwiches. This way we get 2 fantastic meals with 1 roast, each with different flavors, so it doesn't feel like we are eating leftovers. This is a favorite in our house, having it at least every other week.

Awesome and easy.  All the ingredients were on hand which made it all the better.  Next time I would put them in the oven under the broiler first just to brown them up a bit.  I used brown sugar instead of white and a can of beef broth with 3/4 cups water which was quite flavorful.  When I took the ribs out I put a rounded tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in a bit of water and it thickened up the gravy nicely.  Wil definitely make again!!!

This was my first attempt at a slow-cooker recipe and I thought it was great.  From reading other reviews I cut the water in half and still felt the sauce was too watery.  Then I read the last line of the recipe which said to thicken the sauce for gravy.  The next day I reheated the left-overs and thickened the gravy and it was fantastic.
I strongly recommend this recipe and I believe this is one that would probably taste better reheated a day later.

Very good. I did 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar.  I didn't have beef broth, that was fine.  I added a touch of Teriyaki.  Omitted the mustard. It was watery, but I took out some of the watery broth added flour and made a side of gravy ( I added some extra pepper to the gravy).  Everyone enjoyed it.  My sides were corn & white rice

Delicious (and easy)!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 5 pounds of ribs.  Next time, I will add even more ribs.  The recipe as is makes more than enough sauce for the additional ribs without changing anything. I served the ribs with homemade coleslaw, applesauce and baked beans. Will definitely make again.

This is a good recipe but I made a few changes.  I did not add 1 cup of water.  Instead I only added enough water to moisten the bottom of the dish.  The ribs will give off liquid of their own and you will have plenty of gravy.  Then, I added smoked paprika during the cooking and a few drops of liquid smoke right before serving.  They added smokey depth which my family loved.

Ok so this recipes was a total do over 3 times....I made this one night a week prior for my kids, had it in the crockpot for them....when dinner time came, my oldest said the meat was tender and good, how ever my son wouldn't touch it because he complained it was to chewy.He's not much on ribs or roast style meats. But that none of my 4 kids liked the gravy and said it tasted funny......I couldn't figure it out so I made it again....Same way.....same complaints and I even agreed. The gravy was not pleasant at all, the over abundtance of a wang in the sauce was out there. And I didn't like the sauce either. So a third time I made these just to figure out what it was and it's the vinegar. The vinegar is way to much for us and I reduced it down to 1 tbsp and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar. This help much better and used low sodium salt and worcestershire sauce. Even though the meat was tender all 3 times, the sauce was not A1. I'd have a difficult time making this one again....

I really enjoyed this dish.  I did use brown sugar instead of white and cooked it all day (on low) while at work.  I made mashed potatoes with it to use the gravy.  The leftovers made a great lunch.

This tasted great, BUT I would never eat it with rice or potatoes.  We ended up shredding it for sandwiches.  It was delicious!

Doubled the meat and ingredients, but came out watery and bland. Wasn't too keen on a BBQ dish anyway (was kinda misled by the title and didn't pay attention to ingredients) so I put the ribs into the oven for 7 minutes at 400 degrees covered in gravy to salvage what was left. That actually turned out pretty good.

I tried this a couple of days ago and My husband, picky daughter and I enjoyed it.  I alos substituted brown suggar, and added chili sauce when I discovered I had ran out of ketchup.  Also added a little garlic powder.  I prefer flour for thickening, so I used it instead of cornstardh or tapioca.  I meet spice it up a bit more next time- maybe a little horsradish and a dash of hot sauce.

These ribs are delicious. I don't have a slow cooker so I dipped the ribs in flour braised them in a little bit of oil until browned sauteed the onions and then added the rest of the ingredients and simmered them on the stove for 4 hours.  I did have to increase the water and bouillon cubes to cover the ribs.  They were falling off the bone and the gravy was soooo good. My husband loved them. I used brown sugar instead of white, I used 1/2 honey bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup and I also used apple cider vinegar. I thickened up the gravy and served it with cheddar/sour cream mashed potatoes and salad.  I will definitely make again!  Thanks for an easy recipe with lots of flavor!  **UPDATE** I just want to add that this makes alot of gravy, so I froze the left ove gravy and a couple of weeks later defrosed it, floured and braised the ribs, added the defrosted gravy and simmered again for few hours.  It was just as delicious as the first time and made for quick preparation.

Yum - I loved this recipe. I cooked it about twice as long as what was recommended. I accidentally forgot the bouillon cube but it still turned out great. When I boiled the sauce on the stove after the meat was done, I added a few squirts of Trader Joe's BBQ sauce.

This recipe turned out pretty tasty! I followed other reviewers and put it on low for about 8-9 hours until it fell off the bone. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the results, the ribs are tender and have very good flavor. Even the gravy is delicious, I had to transport the sauce to another pot for thickening as the crock pot temp was not getting hot enough to reduce it. I fed my boyfriend and my little cousins and they loved it! Will be making this recipe again, thank you for sharing!

In my opinion, the ribs were not that flavorful, even with all those strong flavored ingredients in the sauce. Although my boyfriend said he liked the ribs, I will not make this recipe again.

Awesome ribs. I usually have a hard time getting the timing just right on my slow cooker but the timing in the recipe was just right. I thickened the sauce with 2 tbsp of cornstarch like another reviewer suggested and it worked out great. Very easy and delicious. Will definitely keep this one around.

I cooked in the crock pot for about 10 hours on low and added garlic, baby carrots and cooked egg noodles at the very end.  I found the sauce to be too... something.  I think the vinegar/ketchup/worcestershire ratio is off.

Very nice!  I had 2 pounds of boneless beef ribs and put the liquid together as listed.  Since I was working with beef, I browned it briefly in a little oil then added the liquid and covered in the Dutch oven on the stove top - simmered for a little more than an hour and they were fantastic!  Very tender.  Nice flavor.  Next time I will substitute brown sugar for the white and maybe double the sauce.  For now, I have to go lick the pot!

This is great way to cook country style pork ribs if you are tired of having them with BBQ sauce. My kids loved them. 

The only thing I did different is to brown the ribs before adding them to the crockpot to help keep them firm.

I did this a bit different. I was lazy and put them in the crockpot while still frozen.. Did the recipe exactly, except it just wasnt sweet enough for my taste, especially with all the sodium, plus the vinegar..so i added quite a bit more sugar, brown and white. Still wasnt enough, so I added some honey for flavor. .ABSOLUTELY try honey in it! For as much sugar as I put in it, it really wasnt ridiculously sweet.. Just enough for almost a BBQ like taste. Also added a few tbsps of honey mustard bbq  sauce. The sauce was a bit thin, so i tried cornstarch to thicken it up, it didnt do the job so I added Wondra gravy mix, and it came out nice,thick and creamy.. Had to scoop them out of the crockpit with a spoon, because they melted off the bone..They came out EXCELLENT, will DEFINATELY make them again!! Had them on top of Schwans Red Skin Garlic Mashed Potatoes...

Fabulous!!!  Took others advice and used 1 can of beef broth and added BBQ sauce. Also thickened the sauce with a TBSP of cornstarch.  Served over rice and my whole family licked thier plates clean.  This is a keeper!!

I made this using venison ribs. I found it to be great. Made a change I added a slice of bacon since the venison ribs are very lean. I also did not use sugar I used a subsitute. One more thing i used water to cover the ribs.

I altered this recipe to accomodate boneless beef country ribs, and it was fantastic. I used a can of reduced sodium beef broth instead of the boullion cube and water. I did not add extra salt since ketchup and mustard both have sodium. Instead of regular black pepper, I used McCormick Hot Shot! which is a blend of black and red pepper for a little extra kick. Brown sugar instead of white; balsamic vinegar instead of cider or white.

This recipe is great.  It is basically like making your own BBQ sauce.  The first time I used the exact recipe.  It was great.  The second time I added chopped garlic, onion, and fresh parsley...it was terrific.  I definetely recommend it either way.  I also cooked it an 1 1/2 high, and 2 1/2 low...very tender.

Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe as stated.  The meat was for sure tender and awesome but just didn't have much flavor.  We ended up pouring bbq sauce all over it to save the ribs.  :(

Gravy was very very thin. I added 2 cups of bbq sauce to it to thicken it up more but no luck. I just dumped the gravy and put bbq sauce on the ribs.

This was just weird. Even when I thickened the cooking liquid to make a sauce, it didn't really become "gravy," nor did it have any real flavor other than the juice from the meat. You would think with all those strong flavors in the sauce, it would have turned out different. Totally "blah," and kind of embarrassing to serve.

These were VERY delicious - even without the sauce!  The meat fell off the bones - soooo tender.  I served with mashed potatoes, turnip & carrots.

I was looking for something other then the usual BBQ sauce for the ribs we had.  I made a few modifications due to not having everything exactly.  1.) used prepared brown mustard and 2.) I didn't have any vinegar and so I used some hot sauce that had vinegar as one of the first ingredients.  It didn't make them spicy at all.  I cooked them on high for about 4 hours (I got a late start!) and then set them on warm and added 4 TBS of wheat bread flour (the only kind I had on hand) and it thickened up the gravy nicely.  It was a hit with my husband and parents.  Will be making again!

I made these with side ribs but forgot to put in the chopped onion..oops.  Maybe that is why I found them to be quite bland...ended up glazing them with plum sauce and putting them under the broiler for a few minutes which saved the meal.

Turned out great and super simple to prepare! The family loved this hearty meal. I made no changes to the recipe but did cook it a bit longer. Served over rice. Will be making again!

Decent. I don't buy ribs often because you can never get them "just right" unless you grill them but I got a great deal so tried this recipe. Mine turned out so soft (guess I crocked" 'em too long) it was like pulled pork but the sauce was good and overall, I'd say give it a shot.

This was excellent! I cooked the ribs for 4 hours, removed them from the slow cooker, thickened gravy with cornstarch, and returned the ribs to the gravy.  Served gravy over mashed potatoes with green beans and biscuits.  Thanks!

Amazing! Everyone should give this a try! I added carrots and potatoes to the slow cooker and it turned out terrific! Also I didn't have Worchesshire sauce, I added extra pepper, paprika, and a bit more water. It wasn't runny at all (maybe because of the vegetables?) anyway, try it!

Great Recipe! I didnt have time to cut up onions so I used a packet of onion soup mix. My family loved it. even my picky 8-year-old loved (she had seconds)! Last week I made ribs and used a store-bought barbecue sauce. This week I made ribs using this recipe, because I didnt have any sauce on had but had all the ingredients for this and it was certainly a bigger hit than the store-bought sauce...No more Heinz for me! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  Very tender and favorful.  I did make a few minor changes. I added some brown sugar and honey (to taste).  I also salted and peppered the meat before cooking it.  I also made a thickening agent out of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these as written.  They were a nice change from BBQ ribs (though the flavor wasn't too far off).  I'd make again, but not necessarily add to my meal rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! I cooked them for about 6 hours on low and the bones just fell off by the end of cooking. The ribs almost tasted like a beef roast! I didn't thicken the sauce because of a lack of time, but I would do that next time.

The prep for this recipe was fast and easy.  I let mine cook in the crockpot overnight on low.  I think next time I will add a little more sugar.  It wasn't quite as sweet as I liked.  We did save the leftovers and made pulled pork sandwiches the next day by adding just a little cornstarch to the gravy.  Yum!

I Love love LOVE this reciepe. It super easy and best of all my children love it. It's also a pretty cheap meal so helps stretch the dollars. :)  The only changes I make is I double the amount of ketchup and I put seasoning salt on the ribs before I put them in the pot. I let them sit while I am prepping everything else and they come up super tasty.

This was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was using regular mustard from a bottle because I did not have ground mustard. This is definitely going to be included in my rotation.

Add a can of whole cranberry sauce & 1/4 cup of spicy mustard for a great sweet & tangy twist, and being from south Louisiana a dash of cayenne never hurts anything & made this a HUGE hit at our cook-out!

This is really good, and super easy, I ahave made it a few times and sometimes i don't even bother thickening the sauce.  It is good either way.  the only thing I change is adding beef stock instead of water.

This was soooo good!  I had to make some changes but not because I felt it needed it.  I used Boneless Beef Ribs, added Onion powder instead of an onion, and I had no Ground Mustard or Paprika on hand so I added Cajun Seasoning instead and I gotta tell you, it worked!  I also cooked on high for 6 hours, at which point I put the sauce on the stove and stirred in about a Tablespoon of Cornstarch till thickened.  We ate with White Rice.  Will make again for sure!

This recipe was quite good and was exactly what I was looking for. I like how it was kinda barbeque but not really. It was extremely tender and was great leftover. I'd recommend it.

I give this 4 stars b/c my kids (1 and 3) and hubby loved them, but I thought this wasn't great.  It IS a nice change of pace from bbq sauce, though.  After about 7 hours on low, they were sooo tender - my mistake was leaving them in for another 2 hours til dinner time .... in that 2 hours, they toughened up significantly.  I also could not get the sauce to thicken, even after almost 1/2 hour.  Made as-written (adding only minced garlic) and the sauce was good but not great, flavor-wise (BUT another reviewer who said this too also used garlic - I'd say for sure do NOT add garlic).

No fuss and tasted fine.  I slow-cooked for about 8 hours on low, then transferred the cooking liquid to the stove top and added ~2tbsp cornstarch to make the gravy.

I never made country style pork ribs before this.  I tried this recipe because I liked the ingredients and the ease of preparation.  They were delicious.  I did double the amount of paprika and sprinkled a little celery seed in for added flavor, which is my personal preference.  Either way, this is a great recipe.  I also cooked on low for six hour for extra tenderness. Will make this again and again.  Thanks for posting and the for other reviews.

Pretty good ... my husband put it together and put it in the crockpot ... it wasn't done after 4 hours on high and I ended up putting the crock in a 350 oven for 1.25 hours.  There was a lot of tasty juice/gravy which we put over rice.  I used country ribs which my husband "forgot" to trim so the gravy was a bit fattier than I wanted, but it was still very tasty.  A good/easy weekday dinner.

These were ok, I have a new crock pot so it cooks at a higher heat.  I cooked them on low for about 4 hours.  They were cooked all the way through but were very dry.  Flavor of gravy was ok, but I don't think I will make these again.

This recipe is so delicious.  My husband requests this at least once a week.  Every time I have made these I have used 1 can of beef broth and omitted the boullion and water.  I cooked them for 4 hours on high and they come out tender and perfect.  After thickening the gravy with cornstarch, serve over mash potatoes.  The gravy is so good you will want some rolls to sop up all the tangy goodness.

So easy!  Followed the directions to the letter and let it cook on low all day in the crock pot.  I didn't like the color on the ribs after they had been in about 4-5 hours (they went in frozen) so I took them out and put them in a saute pan for a few minutes to brown up.  That made a huge difference in color in the crock pot.  When they were ready, I pulled out the ribs and added my slurry mixture (1 tsp. cornstarch to about 1/4 cup cold water), mixed it up, and put the cover back on while I served everything else.  Then I served the gravy over top mashed potatoes.  Huge  hit! After I put the ribs in the fridge, my husband snuck them back out to nibble on "just a little bit."  Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband and I thought this was delicious! I cooked on low for 7-8 hours. This was definately too long. The meat was falling off the bone. I would recommend 5-6 on low next time or as the directions state. After it was done cooking, I placed meat on a plate and poured the sauce into a bowl. I added 2-3 Tbsp. cornstarch, mixed together, and microwaved for about 2 minutes or so. This thickened it up to gravy consistency. Would also be great over potatoes, since there was plenty of gravy to use.

These are the best country ribs I have ever made in the crock pot.  They were so tender and not dry at all.  I had 4 lb of ribs.  I used 1 Tbsp yellow mustard instead of the dry and one can beef broth intead of water and bouillon.  Also, I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar instead of white.  Cooked for almost 9 hours.  Added 2 Tbsp cornstarch to the pot, and the gravy was very tasty over potatoes.

These ribs were great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it. I cooked it longer since it was a lot of meat and it turned out very tender. Don't think you could go wrong with this one!!

I don't have a crockpot, so I cooked the ribs in the oven at 275 for 4.5 hours.  The flavor was alright, however, I will reduce the water from 1 cup to 1/2 cup next time.

This is a easy and delicious recipe!  I followed as written, except I omitted the onion and threw in the slow cooker on low for 9 hours while I was at work.  The sauce was runny when I came home so I made a roue with butter and flour, added the sauce and it thickened up.  I served over white rice.  Next time I may kick up the heat with some cayenne pepper but for a first try it was really tasty!

Ok.  Flavor was fine, but nothing great.  I followed the instructions exactly - my ribs turned out just a tad too dry, which was odd given the wateriness of the sauce.  i was hoping for more of a stick-to-the-ribs kind of sauce.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it, I won't necessarily use this recipe again - still looking for a "Great" rib slow-cooker recipe.

The flavor was great, and the meat was very tender. Since I am an inexperienced cook, would have liked further directions on how to thicken the gravy. I was left with a very thin sauce.

Family loved this for it's flavor. I loved it for it's ease of prep and cooking. 
Used smokey bbq sauce instead of ketchup. Best ribs we've had in a long time.

These were absolutely wonderful.  The aroma in the house while they were cooking drove DH nuts- he would walk over to the crock pot and take big, deep breaths.  I thickened the liquid with a cornstarch mix and it made wonderful gravy for the mashed potatoes we had with it.  Thank you!

I liked this cooking method for country style pork ribs.  The fat separated from the meat after a few hours and was easy to remove from the pot.  The sauce however was a bit vinegary and needed some additional spice.

Very good recipe - nice gravy and easy to make in the slow cooker.  Ribs were very tender.  I might try playing with it next time and adding a little more heat to the sauce, and perhaps use brown sugar instead of regular.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.  I didn't have ketchup so I used tomato soup.  I also added red pepper flakes and braised the seasoned ribs first.  Very easy to make.

This was pretty good but because the gravy was so thin it fell to the bottom of the slow cooker and the ribs on top didn't turn out that great.  I thickened it with corn starch but still not as thick as I would have liked it.  Next time I will use less water and maybe more ketchup/bbq sauce.

OMG, this recipe is awsome! I did make adjustments tho. I omitted the bouillon cubes, and  added 1/3 cup bbq sauce, and used regular mustard. I just doubled it. My family doesnt like bone-in meat, so I used boneless instead. Turned out amazing. A+++++ Will make again.

Didn't have any worchestershire sauce, so I just omitted it.  I also cooked it on low for about 9 hrs.  My husband loved it. He can't wait for me to make it again.

You've got to try this recipe - unbelievably good.  Served with white rice and pinto beans but, hey, who cares about the cheap filler.  The recipe says it serves 6, but there are only two of us and it's all gone!  Don't try this if you will be home - the smell is so good, it will drive you crazy and you will eat half of them before they are ready!  Enjoy.

Extremely easy to throw together before work, but I wasn't impressed with the consistency of the gravy.  I thought it was too watery.
