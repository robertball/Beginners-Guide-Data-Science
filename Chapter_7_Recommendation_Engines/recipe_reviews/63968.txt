I did not have flavored yogurt on hand, just plain nonfat greek yogurt. I used that in place of the strawberry banana yogurt. I did not need the ice as both my banana and strawberries were both frozen. My kids thought this was fantastic--my husband thought this was really sweet and he has a wicked sweet tooth. The consistancy was perfect. Great idea to use sweetened condensed milk but maybe it might be better to halve the amount next time I make this. I think this would make a fabulous frozen smoothie pop this summer.

I didn't have the yogurt on hand so I skipped it.  The smoothie is very tasty and I would recommend it.

Taste was good!  A little sweet though. Next time I would use half the eagle brand.  Wholesome ingredients.  Kids liked it - that's the bottom line.
