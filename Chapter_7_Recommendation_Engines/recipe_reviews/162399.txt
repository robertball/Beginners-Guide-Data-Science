Just something that was edited out: if you don't have Italian seasonning, try 1/4 tsp Thyme, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 marjoram or rosemary.

I thought this was very good.  I did, however, add more seasonings and used tomato sauce since I didn't have crushed.  I didn't have italian seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano (I started with 1/4tsp each but it needed more flavor), reminds me of spaghetti.  It only needs about a minute under the broiler, though next time I think I'll just mix the cheese into the whole thing and not dirty another dish.  My boys all gave me a thumbs up, so it's a keeper.  Thanks for your recipe.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was a HIT, my family loved it. I didn't use the entire 1 pound of cheddar cheese though, I used half and it was more then enough cheese...I think if I had used the entire 1 pound it would have been way too much cheese! So it worked out just great this way, thanks for the recipe!

This was good and fairly easy to fix; I scaled to 5 servings.  The changes I made were using rotini pasta, Italian style tomatoes and adding a dash of worcershire to the sauce.   I mixed half of the cheese into the dish, sprinkled the other half on top... :)

I doubled the amount of tomato products and I'm glad I did so.  The original recipe must be very dry.  Also doubled the amount of seasoning and it could have used more.  A nice goulash recipe if you don't have a jar of spaghetti sauce handy.

I followed the recipe to a T. I had plenty on sauce for all. I did use separate seasonings. Was just great. Thanks

I used organic ground beef and organic roasted diced tomatoes.  A packet of dry mix of Italian seasoning used to make Italian dressing was substituted for the seasoning.  I began with half a packet and ended up adding the whole packet... good!  I used a dash or two of Emeril's Kick It Up Sauce in place of cayenne pepper.  Also added twice as much of diced tomatoes than called for as well as added about 1/2 cup of water.  A half hour of cooking is plenty!  Good recipe that I will make again but believe that the flavor of the ground beef I used contributed to the flavor as well as the Muir Glen roasted diced tomatoes.

I only had one and a half pounds of ground beef so I just used that. I quadrupled the italian seasoning at least the spices and added a large can of organic tomato sauce to make it a little wetter. I didn't use a full pound of cheese just to cut back on the fat content, I used about 4 oz. shredded 2% sharp cheddar. This is just like goulash, or the one I was familiar with as a kid. I served this with Emergency Garlic Bread.

I make this all the time. I use 1lb. ground beef and that's good for us. Really versatile dish you can add anything you have on hand and change it up. This time I used 1 can of peas. I've added 1lb. mushrooms and it was great! I make my own tomato sauce so I probably use more than the recipe. This is in my regular recipe shuffle.

Quick and easy weeknight throw-together! Needs a lot more seasoning.  I used tomato puree and a can of diced tomatoes.  Perfect thickness to hold on to the noodles.

Great taste!  I did think the sauce was a little thick so I ended up adding the rest of a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I also only used 1 lb of ground beef and not quite a pound of shredded cheese.  Mixed half the cheese into the pasta and the rest on top.  Be careful when placing under the broiler that you watch it closely.  5 minutes was almost too long for mine and it was set to LO.   Makes great leftovers!

This tastes a lot like the "taco bake" recipe here on AR but slightly less good. This is not very saucy, and is a very understated dish. It's pretty good, but since it's so similar to the taco bake recipe (which is great) I'll probably scrap this one. =P

I made this but added a liberal sprinkling of nutmeg to the mince and before frying the mince I put the oil in the pan and added 1 x large onion and about 2 tablespoons of Ginger and chili. This went down a treat with everyone enjoying it very much.

This was definitely well liked by my entire family. I modified the recipe to use what I had on-hand. I used Campbells Tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, two cans of diced tomatos instead of one and added a small can of finely chopped mushrooms. After assembling the mixture, I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. I then put a four cheese blend of shredded cheese on top and baked for an additional 10 minutes. I let this rest for 10 minutes before serving.

This was so yummy! Although I had to leave the onion out and mix a few of my seasonings since I didn't have italian seasoning, it was still great. My husband has never liked any kind of pasta or Italian like food, but he gobbled it up and went back for seconds!

tasted fine, more like an italian pasta bake than anything else.  I was hoping for a different flavor, so I was disappointed.  But, the flavor was good, so I would make if I were in the mood for italian.

This wasn't bad...My husband said it was like "spruced up Hamburger Helper." I'd imagine this was better for you as far as perservatives go. It was pretty easy, but still more work than I want to put in for just noodles and tomato sauce. Maybe I'll try this one again when I have kiddos that eat grown up food. I think, because of the amount it feeds on not a lot of money, this would be better for that time in my life. Until then, this was good but not impressive.
