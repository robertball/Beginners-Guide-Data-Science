As others have suggested, you’ll probably end up tripling the sauce amount;  the fried chicken chunks generally absorb the relatively small amount of sauce mixture that is called-for very quickly. Use sesame oil (refined for high heat) for frying.  I’d also recommend that you pre-mix together the teriyaki sauce and honey separately in a small dish (or measuring cup), as opposed to adding each of those separately to the chicken pieces after you put them back in the skillet.  This prevents one or the other tastes from becoming overly dominant.  And I would definitely *not* omit the five-spice powder, as this is the unique, exotic ingredient that has a chance to give this dish a distinctively Asian taste.  The end result of this recipe is relatively unsweet;  if you do like more sweetness (most restaurant-style sesame chicken is actually sweeter than this recipe) I’d add brown sugar to taste when you're at the final mix, and maybe a little soy sauce and ginger powder.   Not the best I've had, but all in all, a very well-done, easy recipe!

This can be very tasty, if you make a few changes.  I halved the amount of flour, and I substituted the five-spice powder in favor of a packet of Honey Sesame seasoning mix that I found in the oriental food section of the supermarket.  I used thin sliced chicken breast which browns quicker, it only took about 2-3 minutes per side.  Also I used broccoli and carrots rather than the onion and peppers.  Like many others had suggested, I made more sauce than called for.  I tripled up on the teriyaki sauce but be cautious to not use too much honey.  Don't bother to add the toasted sesame seeds until the end.  I recommend keeping the red pepper flakes, as they add just a slight amount of heat.  Very simple and quick to make, as well as delicious!

I used one full red pepper in place of the green pepper and based on the previous reviews, I quadrupled the "sauce". To make quick work of the sauce and to cut down on overmixing (and by overmixing, I mean losing some of the "crust" on the chicken), I mixed the teryaki sauce and honey together before pouring it over the chicken. I do not have a wok, I made this in my cast iron skillet--I was pretty proud of that. Wok or not, this still turned out darn tasty. My husband and kids inhaled this. I made a Japanese-Style cabbage salad to go with it, my husband made a comment that those two combined would make a great lettuce wrap.

This was excellent!  I took others' advise and tripled the sauce, it cookes down quickly so I'm glad I did this.  I paired this with the Chicken Lo Mein submitted by Michelle on this site and substituted some of the chicken in that with shrimp.  These dishes went great together.  It was Asian night at our house.  Amber's Sesame Chicken was easy to prepare and the flavor was excellent and just as good as leftovers.  I served it with the lo mean and some white rice.  YUM!

5/13/10  Ok, I've made this before, but couldn't find the recipe so I printed it off the site again.  I made it and was really disappointed.  It is going from a 5 star to a 2 star - something has changed in the listing of the recipe!
The first time it must have said to make the Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade, this recipe now states add 2 T teriyaki sauce.  Well I thought teriyaki sauce was just out of the bottle and it was really bad.  Not sweet, no flavor, and definitely not enough.  Like a had to add 3/4 of a bottle and a ton of honey and it still wasn't sweet.  SO- remembering the first time when it was a "5", I used the Fish and Things and it was to die for.  Somebody please fix this recipe back the way it was.  It had been great before!!!!
MY MY MY!  Very addicting!  This is awesome!!  We also made enough sauce to make it drowned in it!  The Teriyaki recipe makes plenty, so why not use it.  We served it over basmati rice and the whole family loves this!

Per the advice of others, I tripled the sauce.  It seemed necessary.  I also didn't use as many sesame seeds as it called for (I didn't want them to overpower the flavor).  I would also recommend MORE ONIONS AND PEPPERS!  At least double, if not triple.  I will probably cook the chicken longer next time just to make sure it's done thoroughly, just a personal preference.  My husband LOVED this recipe and wants me to make it again ASAP.  (He's a picky chinese food eater and said this tasted authentic--probably the chinese 5 spice).  He did wish there were more onions and peppers though.  Served over a bed of white rice!

YUM!!!  Very good, and thankfully not as sticky or sweet as my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I skipped the five-spice (I HATE black licorice, and that's what the flavor primarily is -- comes from the anise) in favor of some powdered ginger.  The flour didn't stick well to the chicken, so the pieces didn't have a "crunch" but that's okay with me.  Also, I sauteed thinly sliced onion and a clove of elephant garlic in a combination of sesame oil and wok oil (basically garlic oil) first, then removed them before adding the chicken.  Then I added 1/2 C each of honey and teriyaki which made plenty of sauce, (enough for the jasmine rice to soak into) before returning the garlic and onion to the skillet.   My picky picky 4-year-old cleaned his plate!  Can't wait for lunch leftovers!!  Thanks SO much! ** Had leftovers today and wasn't pleased -- way too sweet.  Will try replacing some of the teryiaki with soy sauce next time to cut down on the sweetness.

This came out so good! I had to improvise a little, because I didn't have any teriyaki sauce. After finding out that teriyaki sauce is made of sweet soy sauce and wine, I made my own version of it by mixing half soy sauce and half white wine, which is why mine came out much darker than the other photos of this recipe on this site. I didn't bother to add any extra sweetness. I doubled the sauce as suggested by some of the other reviewers. This dish got rave reviews from everyone. It tasted just like what we order at the Chinese takeout. I will surely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing.

Really enjoyed this recipe.. used fresh grated ginger instead of 5-spice powder. Added a bit of sesame oil to  the pan before frying chicken. Used Fish & Things Terryaki Marinade from this site as recommended and scaled it down to 12 servings.. will use even less next time and cut down on the soy as it was overpowering! This recipe tasted even better warmed up the next day

This was ok for me, my kids seem to love it.  However, I did do a couple of things different.  First, I floured the chicken and fried it in my deep fryer for a couple of minutes to make sure it browned evenly.  I tried to maked  more sauce but not sure how it would turn out so I stopped.  Next time I will just go to town on it.  For the people that could not find the chinese five spice powder look for an asian store nearest you and you will find other spices and marinades we use daily (Cheaper)...  I will try this again....  Oh, since I didn't fry the chicken in the same pan everything else was cooked in I sprinkled a little of my flour mixture in the pan.

My husband and I really enoyed this. The sauce was sweet but still had a bit of a kick to it thanks to the chilli flakes. I served this over rice with steamed green beans and carrots, and it was a very easy and tasty meal.

REALLY tasty, and simple to make.  I did make a few changes, based on many reviews here, and some worked out and some didn't.  1) Don't sub ginger for five spice.  It gave the dish a strange taste.  Not bad, just not very "sesame chicken" tasting.  I would actually say if you don't have 5 spice, try garlic instead-- will give a more non-descript flavor that just adds to the spicyness.  2) I used half the amount of flour called for to dredge the meat, it was totally fine.  3) I tripled the sauce recipe, which seemed to be the right proportion, and 4) I used thinly sliced beef instead of chicken cubes, and it was every bit as tasty!  Just had to adjust the pre-cooking time (just 4-5 minutes to brown), and then added the beef to the cooked sauce only to warm it up at the end.  Overall-- GREAT tasting sauce, really authentic and curbs my sesame sauce cravings.  Will definitely make this one again and again.

We all really enjoyed this entree! It is a nice blend of "Asian" flavors. I followed the directions and cooking method to a "T." I did not add the the crushed red pepper flakes since it was an option. Thou I am sure it would have added a nice kick to the dish. Since I was cooking for two people I used two chicken breasts and cut the amount of flour to a 1/2 cup to dredge the meat and it was the perfect amount. I took the submitter's advice and used, "Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade," from this website. I used 8T each of teriyaki sauce and honey. The Chinese five-spice powder is really a must! It is a unique spice and adds such a nice flavor to this dish. The chicken was cooked just right and seasoned well. The combination of honey, teriyaki and Chinese five-spice all worked well in this dish. I used, "Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade," and served this entree along with, "Almond Broccoli Stir-fry," and "Orange Rice medley," all from this website.

This was so goooood! I left out the onions and peppers and added a little more 5 spice powder. You might want to plan on adding more teriyaki sauce and honey. I served this with rice and steamed broccoli it was better then any seseme chicken we have ever had!

Great recipe!  Very fresh tasting and flavorful!  I changed the serving size to 2 and found that I needed 3 teaspoons each of the honey and teriyaki sauce in order to coat the chicken well enough.  But other than that, I followed the directions as written and it is delicious!!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!!

OMG!  Incredible!  Used "Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade" and it was sooooo good! :-)  Used ginger root instead of 5-spice.  Didn't add extra 2 T honey at end. Veggies: onion, bell pep, mushroom, celery.

I loved it!  Better than take-out!  Based on other reviews, I only used half the flour and I tripled the sauce.  It took visits to a couple of stores to find the 5 spice Chinese powder, but it was definitely worth the hassle!  My 9 yr old also loved it, but my DH thought it was too spicy.

Out of this world.  Husband and I loved it.  Have made it several times in the last month.  Added red peppers and carrots.  It is just the perfect recipe.

I love Asian, and I've made a lot of dishes from this site, but this has got to be one of the worst.  It has little flavor, the breading doesn't stick, and it's just missing something...or a few somethings.

YUM! I love this recipe. I suggest cooking the chicken first, place it on a plate, while you are cooking the veggies, drizzle the teriyaki sauce over the chicken only. After veggies are done Add the chicken. That way the veggies still get the teriyaki flavor but it doesnt turn them brown.

Sooooooo good! Everyone was handing out the compliments! I used chicken tenderloins and as others suggested increased the sauce! Went great w/a fried rice dish.
Loved it!
Added some sugar snap peas to the mix, nice addition.

This recipe was pretty good.  Definitely something different than your regular stir fry.  I forgot to grab a bell pepper at the store but other than that I made the recipe as is.  It was my first time working with chinese five spice and I really liked the flavor.  Next time I'll make more of the honey and teryaki mixture so that it oozes over the rice. Thanks Amber!

This tasted fine, but it didn't taste like sesame chicken. The five spice powder threw it off, and it was not sweet enough. It is pointless to put sesame seeds or red pepper flakes in the flour mixture -- it's not going to stick to your chicken. Add those ingredients, if you desire them, in the final making of the sauce. I used a great deal of soy sauce to make the "sauce" because 4 tbsp of liquid just wasn't going to cut it. Thank you for sharing -- I enjoyed this recipe, and can see how I could tweak it to match the sesame chicken I'm familiar with :)

I don't normally like sweet tasting main dishes - I'm more into savory flavors.  Also, I'm pretty picky and I give very few recipes a 5 star (some folks seem to give everything a 5 star) but this recipe deserves it.  I did vary the recipe somewhat.  I didn't have peppers on hand and but I did have some stir fry veggies - frozen.  Not optimal but I used them.  I used about 12 oz. chicken - there was just 2 of us - and followed the directions pretty closely.  I doubled the sauce amount for what's shown in the recipe and it still could have used more - I did add a nice splash or 2 of white wine (sherry would be good too) just to make it not so thick.  Served over white rice - oh, yes - I added another half tsp of the 5 spice powder because I like lots of flavors.  It wasn't too sweet, my hubby who loves sweet loved it - this one's definitely a keeper.  No, the sesame seeds were not overpowering as some raters were afraid - it is Sesame Chicken after all!

Oh, this was incredible! I did change a few things because it was a bit salty (from the teriyaki sauce) and not as sweet as I would have liked. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce, and I cheated and added a little barbeque sauce to give it a more tangy taste--I know, not very authentic, but it came out perfect. Added a few dashes of cayenne to give it some background heat, but not spicy. As everyone suggested, I tripled the teriyaki sauce and doubled the honey. I mixed them together before putting them in with the chicken. I served with some fried rice, with carrots, onions and peas in it. Excellent! Was WAY better the next day because the sauce got more sticky and really infused the chicken.  My boyfriend told me this needed to be in our list of staple recipes... one to make more often than others. Also, this is a very simple and inexpensive recipe to make because once you have the spices and sauces, you really don't need to go out of your way to get anything to make this another time.

Five stars x 10! This was excellent!! I used ginger instead of the 5-star spice; that is the only change I made. Oh my gosh, this was so awesome. It's going to be a regular!

This was not met with the "chicken again" chorus. I'm always looking for a new idea for the boneless chicken breasts, and this is great! I followed Amber's recipe except I doubled the  sauce. I have requests for it next week from my son. Thanks Amber, we loved it!

This was good, but I love lots of sauce.  I made a sweet and sour sauce by increasing the soy to 1/3 cup, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup pineapple juice, thickened with a tablespoon of cornstarch.  I also added about 1 cup of the pineapple tidbits to the onion and peppers after they had browned.  Rather than putting the red pepper flakes in with the chicken, I added them to the veggies along with the pineapple.  Makes the flavor stand out nicely.  Good basic recipe to experiment with!  I will make it again with short ribs next time.

My husband loves Sesame chicken from the chinese restaurant but I could never get it to taste authentic until this- THIS RECIPE WAS AWESOME!!!  I used Yoshida's and also ground ginger instead of Five Spice- but the chicken was super tender and tasted wonderful- My husband loved it and so did my three year old!!!  Thanks Amber

What a tasty and fairly easy dinner! As recommended,we made Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade from this site, and I used considerably more than this recipe calls for (half of the teriyaki recipe, about 2.5 cups).  Substituted carrots, broccoli, and red bell pepper for the veggies to suit the family. It's a winner!

I have made this recipe a couple of times now and both times it was a hit.  The family really enjoyed it and there were no leftovers at all.  I tweaked the spices a little by adding extra 5 spice, salt and granulated garlic to the flour.  I added more onion and pepper to suit our taste - I substituted a red pepper for the green and added additional teriyaki sauce because it seemed too dry.  The amount of sauce you use is relative to the amount of chicken used.  Overall, very good.

Very good, and everyone in my family liked this. I used a bit less than 1/4 cup of sesame seeds in total, ground ginger in place of the 5-spice powder, a whole onion cut in wedges and a whole green pepper sliced, and made the simple soya sauce/sake-based Teriyaki Sauce recipe from this site. I felt 1 tsp pepper was a bit much, so next time I'll cut back. As others have recommended, I tripled the sauce, but next time I'll quadruple it. The sauce thickens quickly in 1-2 min.

This tasted great. I had to adjust slightly because I didn't have five-spice powder or red ppper flakes, so it was missing that little bit of heat, but it was great. Doubled to sauce like everyone suggested, and didn't put sesame seeds on til the very end. Loved it! Will never order take out again!

It was ok.  The flavor was good, but perhaps a tad too sweet.  It's a big mess to make.  Overall not impressive enough to be worth the fat intake.

Ok, this recipe was fantastic. It took some time to prepare; I made my own teriyaki sauce by boiling Soy Sauce, Ginger, Garlic, Mirin, Rice Vinegar, and brown sugar for 15 minutes - and sliced far more green/red pepper and onion (I used red, super finely chopped) than is called for, and sliced the chicken in long thin strips like you would see in typical 'North American' Chinese restaurants. As stated by nearly everyone else, you really do have to go heavy on the sauce to make the dish spectacular, and it works better with Jasmine rice if you have the extra sauce to put on it. I find that the chicken would be a bit better if it were crispy, so maybe a bit more oil (nothing wrong with a little splurge now and again) at a really high temperature will give the chicken chunks a better texture. Oh, and i put the sesame seeds in at the very end, and it coated all the chicken and peppers perfectly. All in all this is definitely one for the books.

I made some minor changes or I would give 5 stars.  I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic with gonion and pepper  (and added extra onion and peppers.)  Also, added about a tablespoon of sesame oil when adding the teriyaki and honey.  We really liked this and will make again.

Great recipe.  My whole family loved it, even my mother-in-law!  I have made many "chinese" recipes that were a lot more complicated but did not taste half as good or authentic as this one. You will need to double or even triple the amount of sauce you use, depending on your own taste.  I don't know if the recipe just has a misprint, but the 2 tablespoons of teriyaki  sauce were absorbed by  the chicken literally the instant I poured them into the pan.  You probably won't need a whole cup of flour either, I used 2/3 of cup (because that was all the flour I had) and I still had a lot left over after I coated the chicken.  Also, if you like the onions and green pepper, you could easily add a lot more than the original recipe calls for without having to worry about overpowering the chicken.  The amount of red pepper flakes the recipe calls for is fine if you want just a tiny bit of heat, but if you like your food a little more spicy you will definitely need to add more.

I was really hoping to impress with this dish on New Years eve. It was truly a big disappointment, lacked flavour and was a lot more trouble than it was worth. So many good reviews made me think I did something wrong, but no, everything went as it stated. Wont be having this dish again. :(

Excellent! Just like the restaurant. I used fresh ginger in place of the 5 spice, tripled the sauce as others suggested, and partially froze the chicken for easy and more even cutting. Perfect!  A keeper. (My husband and picky 10yr old step son had leftovers for BREAKFAST the next day!) Served with sweet and sour chicken I from this site, white rice and addional steamed veggies. Mmmm.

Really good! I increased the sauce as others suggested. I think the flour is too much. I had a ton leftover after coating my chicken breasts, so they probably did't get as much of the five spice/red pepper as they should have. Still great though; I will just reduce the flour next time. Used Veri Veri teriyaki marinade, which was great. I didn't make it with onions or green peppers, but I did throw in some peapods at the end while the sauce was thickening.

I should really rate this 5 stars because it was such a hit with my family and really did taste great!  But - I did have to increase the amount of sauce significantly to make it less dry.  Otherwise all I have to say is...yum!  I served it over brown rice and it was really, really good!  And seriously, my husband RAVED about how good it was all through dinner and insisted that we make it again!  Not to mention that all 3 of our boys had 2nds.  There were no leftovers!  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

My whole family really liked how this turned out, the finicky husband, and even the 7 and 4 year olds!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, but did take others advice and tripled the sauce, and I may even make MORE sauce than that next time.  Overall, a hit, and a keeper.

this was sooo good! i made it with brown rice on the side (well actually under it but whatever) me and my roommate eat chinese a few times a week and this tasted way better then what we usually get, i used garlic and ginger instead of 5-spice. the only thing i will change is to triple the sauce amount because we love it saucy and this just makes enough to lightly coat the chicken. so, it was deeeee-lish and beautiful as well. thanks amber!!

I used fresh ginger in place of the five-spice powder, and used olive/canola oil.  It came out great!!  I will make this again!

I lightened this recipe to suit my dietary needs, but the spirit of the recipe stayed the same and I thought it was delicious! I skipped the flour and the vegetable oil in favor of simply sauteeing the veggies and chunks of chicken in a pan lightly sprayed with PAM. I also used considerably less sesame seeds. Otherwise, I used all the remaining ingredients in the full amounts. For the teriyaki sauce, I used Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce (it has the least amount of sodium of any store bought teriyaki sauce I can find)...it turned out wonderful! Sweet, spicy, quick, and easy - I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I thought the teriyaki was a bit sweet, but it was good. I liked the combination of the sweet and spicy. My husband thought it was a bit too spicy so I plan to exclude the crushed red pepper and cut back on the 5 spice a little. But all in all a very doable and tasty recipe.

Pretty good and easy to make. The flour and sesame coating doesn't stick very well to the chicken, and I may use less of the Chinese five spice next time. It was a little overpowering.

My daugther said, " This is the best Chinese you have ever made!"   Next time though I won't add 1/2 cup of sesame seeds, it was a lot and big globs clumped up.  I also used 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce and 1/2 cup of honey which for us was a good amount, maybe make a little more next time, we like it saucy!  Well make again for sure!!

This is a beautiful dish, high color and authentic looking.  Mine didn't taste a whole lot like sesame chicken, even though I cooked it in sesame oil.  But I did run low on sesame seeds so that could have been part of it.  I also thought the Chinese five spice gave it an odd flavor, but again I used some that was kind of old.  It was still very tasty, just didn't taste exactly like I was expecting.  My family liked it though, and it looked very authentic.  I would use more pepper and onion next time to give a higher veggie to meat ratio.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was really delicious.  I omitted the red pepper flakes because my kids don't like spicy things and I used red pepper instead of green.  I forgot to add the sesame seeds to the flour mixture and didn't really miss them.  The only other changes I made was to double the sauce ingredients and add 4 or 5 cloves of garlic to the onions and peppers.  The end result was enjoyed by all.

Yum!!  My mom was having family over and my sister and I said we would cook.  We came upon this recipe and thought we would give it a try.  I was nervous at first because it didn't smell that great but when it was all done it tasted great!  Everyone loved it.

Wonderful!  I made this this evening with high hopes that it would be as good as the sesame chicken I get at the Chinese place down the road.  It was better!  The only changes I made was to add about a tablespoon of corn starch to the flour mixture to get a crispier chicken and I made three times the sauce.  Turned out perfectly.  If you are a sesame chicken lover, you need to try this one.  Thanks for Sharing!

I always rate only 5 stars on a recipe but this time I really want to give a suggestion for someone that is going to cook this.  I would put in 1/2 tsp. of the  Chinese five-spice and then add more if you like it.  I thought the spice was over powering.  Also, remember to toast the sesame seeds.  The crushed red pepper flakes are not hot at all, so use them, I think they do help this dish.  I only used 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and I thought that was a little much.  Maybe, start with 1/8 cup and add more if you like them.  I would definately cook the vegetables first and set them aside or cook in another skillet while cooking the chicken. I think the chicken should be crisp. You MUST triple the sauce or you will not have enough for the coating of the chicken and if serving over rice you will need it. If I ever make this again, which I doubt, I will add sliced green onions at the end of cooking.

Very good!  I read the other reviews to give me an idea.  I did add more teriyaki and honey and more vegetables like your member suggested. I did shake the chicken to remove excess flour before browning.  Before serving I added some chow mein noodles on top for the crunchiness.

Simply delighful... A perfect summer dish.  Having made a large extra amount, I use it as a base since the chicken absorbs flavors so readily... Pineapple? "Sake-steam" a little shrimp, codfish or scallops and abracadabra-> a new meal.

This was very good.  I will make this again. Nice to be able to make something close to restaurant quality at home. Thanks for the recipe.

OH my goodness- soo good. I added loads of veggies like I do with all my recipes, which is normally what I serve up myself and give most the meat to my carnivorous man. But with this recipe I could not get enough of this chicken, it was so delish. Will make again and again. (I didn't have any sesame seeds in the kitchen-still good)

Wow!  The five spice powder sauce made this fabulous - and my five spice powder was probably 10 years old.  I used the powder and the fresh ginger, both.  I had bok choy, mushrooms, green onions, sliced carrots and snap peas on hand rather than yellow onion and green pepper.  It worked very well and I'll make it again.  It wasn't too saucy but there was plenty to serve together with sticky white rice.

This had great flavor BUT I just can't imagine how this would of turned out if I did not TRIPLE the sauce!  It would of not of covered all the chicken and would have been bone dry.  I used two large chicken breast.  I did add a tad of ground ginger and added some sesame oil to the veg. oil when I fried the chicken.  I made this with fried rice from this site....I will for sure make this again!!!

I have been searching for a good sesame chicken recipe for years with no luck...until this one!! This was better than our local chinese restaurant's sesame chicken. The only change I made per other reviews was doubling the sauce. It got rave reviews from my husband and two little girls! They couldn't believe it when I told them how easy it was to make. Thank you for sharing this excellent recipe!!

We liked this (by "we" I mean my husband and I), but I did have to double the sauce ingredients. I would highly recommend sticking with the Chinese five spice powder. I did not think that I was going to like it, but I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  Also, I decided to fry the chicken pieces in 3 tbsp. of canola oil and 2 tbsp. of sesame oil. This really brought out the sesame flavor.

Tripled the sauce ingredients:  Thick and not too/overbearingly sweet.  Used 3 'big' chicken breasts to feed two but had enough for four.  Used sesame seed oil, otherwise followed original recipe (no pepper flakes).  To me it was a 'heavy' dish for a 'stir-fry.'  Tasty, quick & simple to make.

I had to substitute ginger powder for the Chinese five spice.  The final result tasted good, but nothing like the sesame chicken I've had before and my brother agrees.  I mixed the sauce all together before pouring it over the chicken, but I could still taste a distinct teriyaki flavor and honey flavor.  It didn't blend well and didn't taste like real sesame chicken sauce.

Absolutely fantastic.  As most people, I made some changes.  I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the flour mixture, and got the perfect coating when fried.  Also, only 1/2 c flour is needed for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken.  I left out 5-spice because I hate the licorice flavor, and substituted ground ginger.  Finally, as almost everybody seems to agree, this needs much more sauce.  I used 12 TBS teriyaki and 8 TBS honey, and it was just the right amount.  If you want sauce to cover rice as well, you'd need even more.

Instead of mixing the sesame seeds in, I sprinkled them on the finished dish so they would stick to the sauce.

Also, I left out the crushed red pepper because of the kids, but I put it on my own serving and it was the perfect complement.

This will be one of our favorite recipes, and I have a feeling my wife and I are going to fight over the leftovers for lunch.

I did what most people suggested here and tripled the sauce (also mixed the sauces together before adding to chicken).  I cooked the chicken a little longer, just to get some extra crispiness.  An absolutely delicious dish!!

Outstanding recipe! My only minor tweaks would be to add some red pepper flakes in the sauce and make more of it. Trippling it seems about right. Also, I add somewhat fewer sesame seeds in the sauce.

I used A1 teriyaki marinade for the teriyaki sauce. This was a mistake. It was way to overpowering. This would be a good recipe and I will make it again just with a different sauce.

This was EXCELLENT!  The 5 spice gave it a great flavor.  I at least tripled the sauce, and followed other advice to mix it before adding to the meat.  I will definitely be making this again.  It was easy enough for a beginning cook like myself, and tasted wonderful!

This is ok.  My son gave it a "B".  I think because it does not really have the same texture on the chicken as restaurant style, but the flavors are good.  I did not have the Chinese spice, so I used ginger instead.  I also did not do the onions and g peppers, I did brocolli, that is what my son likes.  I also will not use equal amounts of terrakyi, vs honey it made it to sweet.  Like the others you do need to tripple up the amounts, because its not enough sauce.  I had left over chicken so I floured it up with the mixture and froze.  I will let you know how that frys up.  Thanks so much for a fun night of cooking!  I made this with wonton soup and egg rolls.

My family, and I thought this was very good home-made version! I made a few changes to the recipe, though, to suit my family's tastes: 1) I used less chicken (3 fresh chicken breasts), so there will be more sauce. (Note:If you make more chicken, as recommended in recipe, it will soak up the sauce. If you like for the chicken dish to be more saucy, I recommend you double the sauce.) 2) I mixed the honey and terryaki sauce together, so the flavors blend well, before adding it to the chicken. 3) I added alittle brown sugar, to make it slightly sweeter. (Note:The seseme chicken they make at resturants, are more sweet than this recipe calls for.) 4) I omitted the vegetables, because my husband dont like them. (Note: To add or omit the veggies, its up to you; based on personal preferences.) The chicken tastes great, either way. Chicken tastes great with or without white rice.  Over-all, this recipe is the closest substitute I found, for the sesame chicken you enjoy, in Chinese resturants. Its good and will satisfy you!

Very delicious!  Whipped it up w/ no trouble whatsoever... Used Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce and TJ's 5-spice - quite a tasty result.  I'm thinking of trying it with a bit of ginger next time around.

Love this.  I've made it a bunch of times now -- a few times for company, too, along with some stir-fried veggies -- and it is absolutely delicious.  I double the amount of teriyaki and honey, use less than half the quantity of crushed red pepper flakes called for, and up the amount of green pepper, so there's about the same amount of green pepper and onion.  Totally yummy over jasmine rice (which is way better for serving with Chinese dishes than regular rice, in case you've never tried it).  Delish!

This was an excellent Dish. Its my husbands Favorite dish to order at a restaurant, I did not care for it until I found this recipe.  It did not taste like your average Chinese Sesame Chicken, I think it was 10 times better. The Chinese five spice adds a excellent flavor, but don't add more than the recipe calls for, or will ruin the whole dish. Very over powering.

Overall a good recipe.  Having made it a couple of times I have some insights.  I cooked it once with honey and the other time with maple syrup and I actually prefer the maple syrup.  For whatever reason it tasted too salty with the honey.  Secondly, I couldn’t find any 5 spice so I used powdered ginger (I was too lazy to chop up fresh ginger) and it works fine.  A couple of other alterations made include adding chopped green onions and broccoli instead of bell peppers and a yellow onion.  Also, I used cayenne pepper rather than the pepper flakes.  This would probably be too spicy for must people but a teaspoon made the dish quite hot though not exactly subtle.  I loved it but my stomach wasn’t so certain.  I tried it with half a teaspoon but that wasn’t quite enough.  Anyway, it is a fun recipe to play around with.

Just got done with this meal and it was YUMMY!!!!I made very few modifications.  I dipped the chicken in egg wash, then in the flour.  I didn't have any Five-spice powder so I had to omit it, turned out fine anyway.  I did as others suggested and made extra sauce, I think I did a little more than double the sauce, becuase we are saucy kind of people :)  and I added brown sugar, a tablespoon or so to the honey, teriyaki sauce before adding it to the wok.  I served with Rice a Roni Fried Rice (Normally would do Jasmine rice but I was out).   My husband says it's a keeper.  Happy cooking.

Wonderful recipe!definitely a five star rating!!  
Like others I changed a few things .I used 8 large white mushrooms cut into six wedges each an a cup and a half of Chinese peas (snow peas)I stir fried these first. set them aside . I used a whole chicken boned  and cut up into bite sized pieces except for the legs and wings ,which I fried for the youngling.I used 1/2 cup of flour and a 1/4 cup of toasted sesame seeds,Which was just right for the amount of chicken.as others have stated the sesame did not stick to the chicken well, so I put the remainder in with the chicken in the wok.I used 8 tbsp of teriyaki and 5 tbsp. of honey and 8 drops of sesame oil instead of seeds for the sauce.
Served over chicken flavored rice with pork and vegetable egg rolls on the side

Great recipe!  I didn't have any 5 spice seasoning so I just used ground ginger.  Also, didn't have a green bell pepper, but it was delicious without it.  I did, as others recommended, triple (maybe quadrupled) the sauce.  I will definately make this again.

LOVED IT!  I only made a few changes and everyone here gobbled it up!  First, I left out the onions, green peppers and sesame seeds.  I know I know... But the outcome was still wonderful!  I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes and deep fried the chicken pieces in my deep fryer.  I too, tripled the sauce and added a splash of soy sauce and a couple splashes of sesame oil. (love this stuff) We had chicken fried rice along with this dish!  Perfect!

I agree with most, this recipe needs more sauce to it. I probably added about 8 Tablespoons of each, teriyaki and honey (and I only made 2 chicken breasts!) I also added more sesame seeds. I used red bell peppers, just because I didn't have green. I had no problems coating the chicken. I like to wash chicken after I cut it so that might have help get the coating on real good. I served it with white rice and spinach on the side. This dish was sweet and delicious!

This is an excellant recipe, I love and so does my very picky boyfriend.  I have made several times.I do change it up a bit, I omit the onion and the red pepper (my boyfriend hates them)I also omit the sesame seeds in the flour( it dosen't stick to the chicken) Instead I add the full amount of seeds while it's cooking, I also triple the amount of  the sauce, it is sooo good, and I put a few slpashes of sesame seed oil with the oil for cooking  and a few more splashes  while the chicken is cookin, it adds a great flavor.I serve it with vegtable fried rice also on this website.

This was so good!!!! The only difference I made was that I made 4x the sauce (honey + terriyaki) at the advice of a friend, and I am glad that I did. Everyone loved it!!

Very flavorful.  I have never had this dish before, but my husband said it tasted like we got it from a restaurant.  I doubled the teriyaki & honey sauce.

I guess I'm just not a big fan of chinese 5 spice.  I would cut that in half, and marinate the chicken using the dry spices and some soy sauce before coating it with the flour.  Otherwise this was really good and probably would make again.

This is a super recipe with some modification.  I have to give this only 3 stars because that is all it deserves if you follow the recipe as written.  I did modify it by using 1/4 c.teriyki and 1/4 c. honey.  With the modification, this is definately 5 stars.  Easy recipe, with great flavor.  I served over white rice, I think I will increase the teriyke and honey to 1/3 c. each next time, as we like it a little saucier.  I will definately make this again, (with the sauce increased!!!) Over all a good, easy recipe!!

I modified the recipe to yield 2 servings, but kept the same amount of teriyaki sauce and honey, added some more veggies and served over rice.  My husband has since requested that this meal be served at least once a week.  Very fast and very easy. A definate keeper.

My family and I found this to be a little bland. An overall good start to Sesame Chicken, but maybe next time I'll add some sweet chili sauce to the mix. I will give it another try.

I have never used Chinese Five Spice in anything before so this was a very different taste for us.  I also used the "Fish and Things" teriyaki marinade, scaled the recipe back to 12 servings.  I used the full 12 servings in the chicken and mixed a little more flour w/ water to thicken the sauce up... and it was pretty saucy.   I agree that it tastes like something from a restaurant.  I will definitely make it again!

The recipe was a little unclear about the actual cooking of the chicken, and the taste was a little too teriyaki for me.  My husband likes it, though, so if you love teriyaki, you'll like this one.

Excellent recipe with great flavor!  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time will probably only use 1/4 cup sesame seeds and only 1/2 tsp five spice powder but will add a little garlic powder.  These changes are just for personal preference but will definitely make again!

Loved it! Easy to make and very flavorful. Don't understand some reviewers that said it had no flavor. My family loved it! I did not add as many sesame seeds as called for, since it would have taken my whole jar. Still tasted great! Will make again.

I don't know why Asian food scares me. This is my second recipe, and it's incredibly easy and delicious. Since it's quite a bit of chicken, make sure the oil is good and hot before throwing the chicken in. You want a good crunch, and if the oil isn't ready, you get more of a saute heating. Next time I will be a little bit more liberal with the sauce so I have plenty to flavor the rice I serve it with. Especially the honey. Do yourself a favor and toast your own sesame seeds. So easy, and the added flavor is fantastic. Just throw the seeds in the dry skillet that you are going to use for the chicken, and work it while you're cutting the chicken. When they get toasty brown and fragrant, they are ready. You won't be sorry. Who needs Panda Express when it's all this easy at home?

I did not follow this exactly. I use my judgment for the measurements. I did not brown the chicken in oil, bake them on a grease prove paper. I add carrots and it was lovely. I would make it again

Great recipe. Made a delicious dish. The only issue is that, as other reviewers have said, it doesn't make enough sauce. I'd suggest tripling the teriyaki and honey.

This was incredible! I made only two minor changes, and that was adding water chestnuts and using chicken tenderloin.  This recipe with veri veri teriyaki is outstanding! Kudos to the originator for a home run!

I absolutely love this! I make as is, and it is fantastic. The five spice powder really makes this recipe, though you need to make sure that you have a good blend. (I just bought a new one--don't think I like it)

This is my family's favorite meal! It is very easy, however a little time consuming,  so give yourself enough prep & cooking time. I alway double for us (family of 7) plus I love having  enough for left overs the next day for lunch. I also double teriyaki & honey. Fantastic meal!

It was a little too sweet for my taste. So I would cut down on the honey, since teriyaki sauce is made with sugar in it. The five spice powder is a MUST have. Gave the chicken an aromatic smell.

This was amazing! The only thing I changed was the Chinese 5 spice because I could not find it. I used ground ginger instead and thought it still tasted really good. I will keep looking for the Chinese spice and try it next time!

When I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Idaho Falls,ID; good Chinese Restaurants were very hard to find, in fact there are only 2 here that are reasonable but still don't come close. Also they are across town. So it was time to learn how to cook my own Chinese Take-Out. This recipe was pretty close to the real thing. I did it with boneless skinless thighs and it was so good I almost didn't leave any for my 2 teenage boys, who were both out, I just wanted to keep eating little pieces of chicken. Who needs mediocre restaurants when I can cook just as good, if not better, at home.

Yum! Hubby really isn't a Chinese food fan.  He loved this.  We both did.  I think it's because it was so fresh.  Added broccoli and carrot.  Also, didn't have sesame seeds so added a few dashes of sesame oil.  For the teriyaki, I used Very Very Teriyaki but no honey.  It was sweet enough as is.

This is an awful lot of chicken to crowd onto a skillet and expect it to cook in 5 minutes. It didn't. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers to triple the sauce. That was not a good suggestion. It was way too much sauce. It still came out pretty tasty, just too much sauce.

Pretty good!  I didn't like the fennel in the 5-spice powder, so I used a mixture of cinnamon and ginger instead.

Delicious! I REALLY enjoyed this. My hubs prefers Sichuan-style Asian dishes, but I tend to enjoy sweeter ones (i.e. sesame, orange, sweet & sour, etc.), so it's no surprise that I liked this more than he did. :) Not only was this super yummy, it also satisfied my craving for Chinese take-out lol! As many others suggested, I too made more sauce (3 x's worth). In retrospect, I wish I would have only doubled the sauce, starting with the recommended 2 T teriyaki / honey and adding more to taste. I had FAR too much sauce!!! This in no way affected the outcome, but I will certainly not add as much sauce next time. I also did NOT find it necessary to make the "fish & things" teriyaki sauce so many reviewers say "made" the dish. If  you purchase a good quality teriyaki, you'll be fine. I used Kikkoman's roasted garlic (couldn't find Mr. Yoshida's) and thought it was EXCELLENT! Other than cutting back on the sauce, my only other suggested change is to not cook the veggies as long as directed. Since I prefer slightly crunchy veggies as oppsoed to soft ones, I'll definitely keep this in mind next time around. NOTE: Do not make the same mistake I almost did.... I found Dynasty brand 5 spice powder in my grocer's ethnic aisle. A 2 oz. jar cost me $2! A 1.25 oz. bottle of Spice Islands 5 spice (in the baking aisle) was DOUBLE this price. Served with steamed rice, egg rolls & almond cookies for dessert. Thanks SO much for sharing, Amber. This will be added to my recipe box for sure! :-)

I did as others recommended and tripled the sauce.  I also used about 1/4 the red pepper, but might up that a bit next time. Everyone loved it....easy and good.

This is outstanding!  Adjust the honey to suit your taste (I like my sesame chicken a little on the sweet side).  I added a whole head of garlic (an entire head, not a bulb) to the marinade, and used black sesame seeds since that's what I had on hand.  I tripled the sauce, but I plan to make six times what the receipe calls for next time (so there's plenty of sauce to accompany the white rice I serve it with).  Thank you so much for the receipe -- it's awesome being  able to make restaurant quality food at home.

This was a delicious recipe!  I served it on a bed of white rice and used chop sticks to eat it... yuuuuummy. I didn't have Chinese five-spice, so used cloves, cinnamon, garlic powder, onion powder and a bit of cayenne.  I'm going to use a bit less sesame seeds next time though.  Success!

This was soo easy to make. I tripled the sauce like others had mentioned and had to substitute ginger for the 5 spice powder. I used 3 lbs. of chicken as I sometimes cook enough for a 2nd meal later. My kids told me that it was better than the real chinese food and that it goes to the top of their favorite meal list :)

I spent 30 minutes trying to convience my husband that I had actually cooked this and it was not carry out. I have been trying to find a simple and good Sesame Chicken recipe and I finally found it. LOVED this! I made a little more sauce than the recipe calls for but it was wonderful.

This recipe was delicious.  I doubled everything except the chicken for my family of 7 and still had two servings left over.  I also added another X4 of the sauce when I noticed that there wasn't enough.

Awesome!!! Have made this many times I prefer ginger to the Five Spice.  Totally great recipe.  Forget restaurant Sesame Chicken.  My son and boyfriend love it. I make my own teriyaki marinade by combining soy sauce and brown sugar along with the honey. Also, I prefer polbano peppers over green - they add much more flavor and are more economical!

This was delicious, even better than the chinese restaurant. I did make some of the changes suggested by others. I used 1/4 c each of the teriyaki and the honey and heated those in the microwave for 30 seconds before putting in the wok together with a teaspoon of fresh ginger before returning the chicken. This was the just the right amount of sauce for 3 chicken breasts.
I used broccoli just because that is preferred in our house.

Very tasty!  Like some other reviewers, I used a red bell pepper in place of a green one.  The only other addition was that of salt.  I found the chicken needed just a little so I sprinkled some over the chicken and the veggies at the end. Served over a bed of white sticky rice, this was a great dish.

This is a great recipe. I do change it a little. I double the sauce and only add a couple tablespoons of sesame seeds to the sauce. If you add it to the flour mix most of it just gets wasted and it doesnt make a difference in taste. I also use a whole orange pepper. I have made it with many different peppers and orange tastes the best in this recipe. I also half the flour mix amount otherwise it wastes ALOT of flour and five spice powder.

Realy nice taste! Only had 2 problems. 1st The flour mix didn't realy stick well to the chicken, so I had to first dip the chicken chunks into beated egg, so problem fixed! & 2nd like others said sauce was just not enough! So I doubled it! I also added other chinese vegtables and served with white long grain rice, all in all very nice meal!

Very good! I love Chinese food, and am always looking for easy recipes.  For this one, you really need to at least double the sauce or it's way too dry.  I didn't have the Chinese spices but it wasn't a problem.  I left out the green pepper and added 1 clove of fresh garlic.  Served it with grated carrot and steamed broccoli--YUM!

This recipe was lacking something for us. I was anticipating a flavor more in line with what you would get at a chinese restaurant and this really wasn't it. It is very sweet, but needed something more. We ended up adding some chinese hot sauce to make it taste better. It did help.

AWESOMENESS!! I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup corn starch to fry my dark meat chicken (personal preference). I had no 5 spice powder on hand so in the flour mixture, I used 1 tsp powdered ginger 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg which coincidentally is 3 out of the 5 spices in 5spice powder. Other reviews said to increase the sauce, so I used 1/2 cup teriyaki and 1/3 cup honey -plenty of sauce for the jasmine rice.  My kids and my DH who is a finicky Chinese food eater loved it!  He even said that when he burped it burped like Chinese food (now that's a compliment).

This recipe is super easy to prepare. I did have to triple the amount of teryiaki and double the amount of honey. I also added about a tablespoon and a half of soy, just to cut down the sweetness. I messed up with the coating (my fault). I put the coating in a bowl and threw in my chicken and tried to coat it that way...didn't work out so well so I would stick with only doing a few pieces at a time in a plastic sack even though it's quite time consuming.

this was great, i added about 2 tbsp maple syrup and doubled the honey and tripled the teriyaki sauce, and garlic powder for the sauce, then brushed it on to the chicken and let the chicken marinade for about an hour, then i breaded it in flour, sesame seed, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and more garlic powder, i lightly breaded each chicken breast tender and then baked it for about 1/2 an hour at 400, i turned it once 1/2 way through...and i sauted the onions and peppers in the same sauce and added them when i turned the chicken. When it was done i removed the chicken and added a cup of chicken broth to the baking dish and scraped the pan and mixed it all together, it was delicious!! I served with white rice, green beans, and home made egg rolls that a friend made. Thanks so much.

My boyfriend and I made this the other night, and ate all of it in one sitting. It did not taste like the cheap Chinese take-out we had hoped to emulate, but it was very very good anyway.  We did make a couple of changes to the original recipe though. First we omitted the onion and green pepper, just per our personal tastes, I used fewer sesame seeds as well, maybe 1/4 cup total. We also added about 1 teaspoon of freshly ground ginger to the sauce at the end. As other reviewers have said, DEFINITELY increase the sauce amount, as the chicken soaks up a lot. Others have said to triple it, and I agree, quadruple it if you'd like extra to serve over rice.

simply awesome!  I've been looking for a recipe like this, but was skeptical it would come out well.  It really surprised me!  My whole family loved it too!  I made as is, but next time will double the sauce because it was so good that there wasn't enough of it!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Don't add the chicken to the sauce right away.  Let the sauce thicken and reduce a little, then toss the chicken just to coat it.  If you don't do it this way, the chicken soaks up all the sauce and you'll write a review saying you needed to triple the sauce...

I didn't have any honey, so I substituted brown sugar, I used sesame oil in the wok, and omitted the 5-spice (I hate that stuff).  It had a good sesame flavor, not very sweet or sticky like at the fast food Chinese places in the mall. Served over steamed rice with vegetables on the side.  This one is a keeper.

This is EXCELENT!!! I made it last night as the recipe stated for the ingredients part - although I made extra sauce & fewer sesame seeds. The sweetness was perfect - I usually think the resturants make it a bit too sweet - loved this - and sooo easy! Now for what I did different---I used two pans - cooked the chicken in one and saute'd the veggies in the other with a bit of soy sauce. None of this setting one aside while cooking the other -yada-yada stuff - much simpler using two pans. For veggies I used onion - broccoli - red pepper & carotts. Served it all on brown rice. Great - easy & healthy meal.  I can't waite for leftovers!! Thanks Amber - you rock!

My son saw this on the site and asked me to make it. He gave it 2 thumbs up! Used 1c flour with 1/2 tsp of 5 spice.  (did have flour left over) Tripled the sauce but then also added 2 TBS of duck sauce.  sauteed some brocoli in with it. Seconds were even better than firsts becasue the sauce thickened up. Will definitely make this again.

All I can say is 'WOW'.  Great recipe.  I had guests for lunch & decided to try this as it seemed quick and easy.  It is a real winner and will be making more of it.  After reading the the reviews, I tripled the sauce recipe & it workded great.  Other than that, I didn't make any changes.

This is a fantastic recipe!  We made a few adjustments and couldn't get enough of it!  Rather than using an entire onion, we used about 1/2 cup sliced yellow onion and substituted 1 each of  yellow and orange peppers.  The sweet, crispiness of the different peppers added such a great flavor to this dish.  Would also reduce the sesame seeds to 1/4-1/3 cup. Served with Sushi/sticky rice.  FANTASTIC!

This was a tasty recipe. I would have liked less Chinese 5-Spice because it is such a dominating taste. And I would add 2 or 3 times the teriyaki and honey for the sauce or else it doesn't add any flavor. Also, salt, I added 1 tsp of salt for some enhanced flavor.

Really 4-1/2 starts.  I made this for 2 servings - love that feature - used peanut and a splash of sesame oil.  Added fresh green beans and found that I had to cook the veggies longer than 5 min to get them just right (not overcooked)  For the sauce I used 3 tbsp each of teriyaki and honey and it was a bit too sweet so will try 4 teriyaki / 2 honey, but this is a good qty for the sauce.  No need to eliminate the red pepper flakes, not hot at all.  Served over steamed rice with a few drops of hot sauce to reduce the sweetness.  Hubby loved this one, me too!

This was so yummy!  I followed some advice & tripled the sauce, but it would have been better just doubled.  The recipe never said to drain the extra oil, so I just put the sauce in with the chicken, veggies & oil.  The sauce stuck to the fried chicken & when done, I was able to just scoop these delicious crispy chicken chunks in yummy sesame wrap right out of the hot oil & eat over steamed brown rice.  Will be added to our regular dinner rotation!!!!

very good, but I made twice and liked it better with some changes I made. Coat the chicken pieces in a mixture of cornstarch/flour, it's crunchier that way and won't get soggy when you add the sauce. I don't bother with the onions and peppers, it doesn't add much to the dish and my kids won't eat it that way. Double the sauce, but not the sesame seeds. And I think the chicken will soak up all the sauce no matter how much you make, so I will make extra to serve on the side next time. And I don't have 5 spice blend so I used a bottle of teriyaki sauce, it was already pretty seasoned. The dish was very salty, so I would try watering down the sauce with chicken broth, but that depends on the type of teriyaki sauce you choose to use.

This dish was great! Although I pulled the lazy route and did not fry the chicken or use any flour. Instead I sauteed the chicken with onion and bell pepper. I did triple the sauce and I added the sauce when the chicken was fully cooked (sesame seeds were in the sauce). I then lowered the heat and cooked on medium low for about 20 minutes, letting the chicken absorb the sauce. I served it over white rice. It was wonderful! Even my picky kids loved it. Defo will cook again!

I modified this recipe a little bit, and it was incredible. First I marinated bite sizes of breast meat in fresh garlic and ginger, mirin, teriyaki, sesame seeds, sesame oil, soy, and a bit of honey for about 2 hours. Then for the flour mixture I used half flour and half potato starch (Japanese) with the five spice. Added a little teriyaki and honey while cooking, and served with garlic fried rice and sauteed baby bok choy, red pepper, onion, and broccolini. Rave reviews from my guests!

I don't like to leave negative reviews just because everyone likes different things and has different taste buds. But this recipe didn't work for me or my husband. We didn't like it. I followed it to a 'T' and double the sauce as other members mentioned, but it had a weird flavor. I will not do this again..=(

I made this not knowing what to expect, my husband and I both agree it was WAY better than most chinese places around here. Instead of bell pepper I used carrot. The sauce by itself tastes too much like teriyaki, so I added a bit more honey, about a tbsp of brown sugar and a spoon full of regular sugar ( I ran out of brown ) It wasn't overly sweet this way either, still way less than what you get at restaurants. I used sesame oil/olive oil spray to fry the chicken and vegetables and ginger powder instead of five spice, couldnt find it. Amazing, my only regret was making enough for just two servings!

It was good but not great.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  It didnt have the crispyness that I love from the restaraunt, I would also definetly suggest like others already have, to double or even triple the sauce and definetly add more crushed red pepper to get more flavor.

I am pretty stingy with my stars. I wish they had a 4.5 option. I think that's what I'd really give this. The ONLY complaint is with the Chinese five spice. There was an odd flavor that I don't usually taste in Chinese food, it was subtle, but I didn't care for it. It was the spice. This was still VERY yummy - and I didn't leave any on my plate!! I would make again - maybe cutting back on Chinese spice - or omitting it all together!!

The Chinese 5 Spice powder ruined the recipe. We will not be having this again.

So Amazing!  The only thing I did different was added the sesame seeds on top of the finished chicken

Delicious!!!  I substitute Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce rather than terriaki sauce and honey.  Great taste and sweetness.  Can add brown sugar for more sweetness if desired.  Also added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger to the dry mixture and 1/2 t. mixed in with the sauce and sesame seeds.  An instant hit for sure!

This was SO good and SO easy! My husband loved it and has requested that this be a regular in our family. I made this for 4 adults and found that 5 chicken breasts was  a LOT! 4 will probably be perfect (leaving a little extra for a lunch the next day). I did not have Chinese five spice, so I used a combo of ground cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. It came out really great!! And I ended up using about 1/4 cup of oil in the pan while cooking the chicken. MAKE THIS TONIGHT!!

This is seriously the best ever sesame chicken.  Do not substitute anything for the Chinese 5 Spice powder.  It will not be the same.  I found it in the asian section of my grocery store and not in the spice section you'd think it would be in.

I used 1/2 the flour as others suggested but I thought the chicken was flavorless, which is why I'm giving this three stars. This was the first time I used five spice and not quite sure if I care for it. The sause on the other hand was very good, and you definetly need to make more to coat the chicken. I will probably make this again but with a few changes. Thanks for the recipe, Amber.

I think this recipe is great.  My husband and 5 year old love it too.  I use red pepper instead of green and throw in some sliced carrots for extra veggies.  I also triple the sauce.

This is pretty good stuff. I have made this in several variations when I don't have one of the ingredients and it still turns out great. I have served this on a bed of mexican rice with mexican cheese melted on top. YUMMY!!!
My kids don't even ask to go out and eat anymore.

Yum yum yum!  I used half the chicken, so I cut the flour in half but kept the spices at the same level.  I used ginger instead of five-spice powder and added 1/4 tsp Accent.  I used 1/2 c Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce, 1/4 c honey, and a Tbsp sugar.  Soooo good.  It was a little salty though, so next time I'll try to find a reduced sodium teriyaki sauce and use half reduced sodium, half Veri Veri.  It was very good, and I will definitely make again!

This recipe is fab - really tasty and plates beautifully.  It is a huge hit whenever I make for company.  Recommend doubling the sauce and adding extra 5 spice powder.

Before you try this recipe, smell the Chinese Five Spice. It has a prominent effect on the flavor of this dish. Neither my husband nor I liked this, unfortunately.  We both love the sweet Sesame Chicken that you get in Chinese restaurants.  This was not in the same league.  Sorry.

Very good! Followed advice of others and made extra sauce. Also cut back on the flour and 5 spice (b/c I don't like a lot of 5 spice). My son who is a picky eater loved it. Have made this several times and it's easy to adjust to your taste.

Wow, this came out REALLY good.  We are vegetarian and I have been missing sesame chicken, one of my favorite pre-vegetarian dishes.  I used cubes of firm tofu instead of chicken with this recipe, used the fresh ginger instead of the 5-spice powder and tripled or more the sauce.  It came out fantastic.  My 6 year old asked if we could have it every night and my husband loved it too.  Thank you!

Like others, I used way less flour, and made much more sauce. I found it rather sweet but Husband thought it was perfect. If I were to make it again, I would probably add some broccoli florets. Good stuff. Thanks, Amber!

After I made the suggested changes, I would give the recipe 5 stars.  As it stands though I needed to half the chicken coating mixture, and triple the teriyaki marinade.  It is also best the first day, not designed for leftovers!

This was very good. I did make some changes:  I used twice as much onion and green pepper as called for, and since I like lots of sauce, I used 1 cup of teriyaki sauce and omitted the honey because I thought it was sweet enough.  I will definitely make again.

I cooked this recipe for the first time this evening and really enjoyed it even better than the local chinese! Although I did take the advice from some of the other reviews and use 8 tblsps of terriake and honey which made much more sauce. Second time round I think I will use 6 honey to 8 terriake as It was slitely to sweet for my liking. I also used a splash of sesame oil in the marinade as I love it so much. Great recipe can't wait to try it again.

This was very good.  I used my own homemade teriyaki and about half of the honey called for.  For vegetables I used broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus and mushrooms.  I found the flour to be a little to much.  Next time I will cut the flour in half.

This recipe is excellent!  I also tripled the sauce as other readers have done, it is so succulent and sweet!  I added the sesame seeds to the chicken while cooking instead of with the flour. I also added a few splashes of sesame oil to the chicken while cooking.  I served it with a vegetable fried rice recipe from this site as well.  My picky "steak and potatoes hubby" made a face at first and then after a few bites said "this is really good" and at end of meal said "you can make this more often!"  That is a compliment coming from him.  Will surely make a couple times a month, at least.  I took left overs to work with me next day and it was wonderful!!!

This was very tasty although I thought it had more of a ginger chicken taste than a sesame chicken taste. Both my boys loved this!They rated it a 5. My hubby and I gave it a 3 and a 3.5 stars. It was really easy and quick. A great use for chicken! I made triple the sauce as others recommended, and still my guys said they wished there was more sauce, lol! I will make this again.

Oh my goodness!! This recipe is absolutely fantastic. If I could rate it a 10, I would. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I tripled the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers.

very, very good! Definetely a keeper. The only thing I would change is adding the sesame to the flour. It did not adhere to the chicken, so I thought it was a waste. Also, because the sauce is so good, I would double the amount. The end result was very tasty indeed.

This was very good.  I left out the pepper flakes, didn't use the onion or bell pepper, and used ground ginger instead of 5 spice.  I also increased the sauce.  Next time I make this I am going to try the sauce with more honey and less teriyaki, maybe a 2:1 ratio, since I really liked the flavor that the honey gave to the dish and the teriyaki was a bit strong.  I will definitely be making this again.  It's delicious!

Well, the chicken defintely needs to be cooked a lot longer than 5 minutes, unless you like your chicken pink (UGH).   I will try one more time with the chicken well done, and then well see if it is the same.

I loved this recipe!  I used the Fish and Things Teriyaki marinade (scaled down to 12 servings).  Next time I might use a little more 5 spice powder because I like the taste.  This dish has a really nice flavor.  Even my picky 4 yr old ate it!

This sesame chicken was amazing! I absolutely loved it. I want to make it again. The sauce was great-- but I would definitely make more of it. Also, I am going to try it with different vebetables as the green peppers weren't my favorite. But the chicken was fabulous, and I am a very picky chicken eater.

This was just fabulous. I made only about a pound of chicken so I didn't need as much flour and seeds, but still found even after reducing it to scale I still had more than enough. Next time I think I might add a few more spices to it, but otherwise I won't change a thing.  MMMMM good!

OHHHH MY ! This was excellent. Loved it. Some minor tweaking, I used Wok oil with margarine added as needed. Will add more onion next time. Yum. Also added sliced celery. Next time will add mushrooms. Took the advice of others & to stretch the sauce, I added 1/4 cup of Teriyaki sauce. Will def. make again. Tx. Very good.

This is the best sesame chicken recipe I've found. I made some minor tweaks in the spice department to suit my tastes a bit more & it came out fantastic. As others said, it's a little light on sauce, so i added more teriyaki & soy sauces right before serving. Everyone I've served this to simply loves it

Great Recipe.
Using Ginger is a great idea for an extra kick. The 5 spice is a little too bland for me. 
But it was a hit at my house.
Highly recommended

My family enjoyed this recipe.  For the health conscious, I suggest substituting peanut for vegetable oil, eliminating the honey, and reducing the flour to 1/2 cup.

I must have done something wrong. It was fairly tasteless. I think it could have definitely used more of the marinade and honey. It looks good though!

Although the flavor of this dish was good, I found the “crispiness” on the chicken disappeared when I added it back into the sauce. The chicken became almost wet & mushy on the outside. Also, I used red bell peppers & doubled both the peppers & onions & I doubled the sauce. If I do make this again, I will add even more veggies and triple the sauce.

Better than at a restaurant! These were my boyfriend's exact words after I made this dish for my family this past Sunday. It was so finger-licking good! I basically doubled this recipe and it was plentiful for my little family of 4. The sauce is so good! I can't stop talking about it. Steamed some white rice and it was the perfect Sunday meal.

Very good meal.  I try lots of new things on my family, and this one is requested often!  After reading reviews, I also used 1/2 c. flour and tripled the honey/teriyaki mixture.  Served it with fried rice and it was gone quickly.

The first mistake was 5T of oil, too much all at once and needed more oil with the rest of the chicken.  I should have known when I saw 2T of teriyaki sauce for 30oz of chicken not nearly enough sauce or even a glaze. I was able to save the meal but won't bother with a recipe that takes this much modifications.

Pretty good, I added maybe too much ginger so I would caution to not over do the ginger (less is more). I also fried the chicken separately added it at the very end so that they crunch crust would just absorb the sauce but not break off from stirring. I also would recommend adding more servings of veggies. Good dish to mix things up!

Used thin cutlets, then cut them into small pieces before mixing in the sauce.  Also doubled the sauces and leave out the bell peppers

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I made a TON more of the sauce than the recipe asks for because it would have produced hardly any if I hadn't. I used the Kikkomen Takumi original teriyaki sauce because it had sesame seeds in the sauce and it worked wonderful. I think if I had used just plain teriyaki sauce it would have been very bland. So if you are going to make this make it with a triyaki marinade or the Kikkomen Takumi or something like it. It was a bit on the sweet side but I really like that kind of thing. We served it over brown rice and it was wonderful. I think next time I'll add more onion and do green red and yellow peppers for more color and pop.

Followed recipe to a tee. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't the usual taste you get when you dine out. The chicken was terrific though.

Mine turned out pretty good. I needed to add more sauce to mine so I added 4 Tbs of honey and 4 tbs Teriyaki sauce. Next time I will add green peppers and more onions.

I think I have made this recipe 50 times over the years and it is always perfect!  Fantastic flavor, easy, and quick!  It has been a favorite of mine and my co workers for years.  When short on time, I will just make the chicken and add bottled general tso sauce and it is fantastic!

This isn't the typical restaurant (deep fried & very sweet) sesame chicken, but it is a very good dish. I will make again.

I just made this and I swear to betsy this is about the best chinese food I've had in a long time, and I can't believe I made it! I didn't use the five spice, instead I used ground ginger, cheaper and so yummy. I probably used about two teaspoons of ginger in the flour mixture. And when it came to the vegetables, I used two whole green bell peppers and three fourths of an onion, and I cooked the vegetables in a tablespoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of ginger. I also added a can of baby corn in the step where you add the vegetables to the meat and sauce since canned baby corn is already tender. I also made about five times the sauce and served it with sticky sushi rice. SO SO SO GOOD!

A new favorite in our house.  My wife is vegetarian so I substituted firm Tofu and the dish turned out spectacular.  I used red peppers for color and the definitley added flavor as well.  I am teaching my son how to cook and this was his first experience.  He has hated onions for a long time and because of his contribution to this dish he now has a new found appreciation for them.

This is my family's favorite oriental chicken recipe.  I don't deviate much from the original recipe, other than changing up the vegetables depending what I have on hand.  I double the honey/teryaki glaze so that there is extra for the rice.

A very nice recipe, with half the ingredients as other sesame chicken recipes, which is a big plus for me, I'm a college student on a budget.

I added a bit more honey and teriyaki sauce than was recommended, but it comes down to personal taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and the breading didn't turn out the way I wanted. The flavor was okay but I expected more from the sauce. I tweaked the sauce by adding sugar and it turned out better for me. I'll try again and rate this again if it turns out better but I am going to add my own twists.

The chicken came out kind of gooey and clumped together.  It tasted fine, but what went wrong?  I will have to try again to see if I can make it better.

Ended up using 7 tablespoons of veg oil.  I did use ginger in place of the chinese 5 spice.  I had a red pepper on hand, so I used that instead of a green one.  I also added another tablespoon of honey to suit our tastes.  Dinner was perfect!  Served over rice w/fresh grn beans.  No leftovers here!

We all loved this recipe. I used 1 tbs. of honey on accident, not 2, but that was perfect. I used ginger instead of the five-spice. I also used about 1/8 of a cup of sesame seeds and added a lot more teriyaki sauce to coat chicken. It made it more of a teriyaki chicken, but it was great! It was slightly spicy!

This was surprisingly good.  I, like many others, thought that the amount of sesame seeds was excessive.  I used 2 tablespoons for the 1 cup of flour and it was fine.  I used that amount of flour to make a double recipe.  I, like many others, doubled or tripled the sauce.  Loved it.  If you don't like spice, leave out the crushed red pepper.  It wasn't too hot, but if you don't like spice, leave it out.

Amber you have an awesome recipe here, made it for lunch and loved it, also used the sauce on my chicken wings too! I never had to order out again! Only thing is I had to use more sauce as it was not enough for the chicken.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly - except I tripled the sauce per a few other reviewers, which is a must. I will probably add a little more red pepper next time, as my husband and I thought it was a tad too sweet, but the kids loved it! Thanks!

I loved this recipe, I made a few changes.  In place of bell pepper, I used shredded carrots.  I also added some thinly sliced mushrooms and sliced the onion very thin.  Be sure to add the red pepper flakes, I didn't use them the first time I made the recipe, thinking it may be too spicy, but they added alot of flavor.

This recipe was just ok for me. I had to double the honey and teriyaki sauce and it still didn't seem like enough, so I just kept adding until I thought it seemed right. I didn't use the five spice powder because I've read in other reviews that it's too strong of a flavor, plus I didn't have any. But probably could have used a little bit. I'd have to keep playing around with it to get it to be what I was expecting.

Great recipe but next time I would cut the chicken into smaller pieces as oppose to big chunks as the recipe calls for. I also added more teriyaki sauce for more flavor.

This was a great recipe, but I'd make a few changes next time. The crushed red pepper flakes didn't seem to do anything in with the flour mixture, so I think I'll add them at the end. Perhaps less flour, too. I would also add the sesame seeds at the end and WAY less. More veggies, too. And I'm thinking some sesame oil would add to the flavour too. I served it on brown rice and it was great. This is a fun and easy recipe to tinker with, so try it out!

Delish!  Next time I will half the amount of flour; I had a tone left over. I'll also hold off on putting the sesame seeds in until the end, as many of them ended up thrown out with the excess flour.  I did add extra sauce as many others did.

I made this last night and it turned out GREAT. It took more time then I thought but it was because I had to cut up the chicken and I used boneless chicken thighs, next time will but the chicken strips. It's a keeper, my husband loved it. I also used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

This was really good. The smell of it cooking was incredible! I didn't cut back on the five spice. I was short of sesame seeds, so that ingredient got cut way back.  Also, for the lack of sauce that others have commented on I added a bit of chicken stock. (Saves on all that sodium) In the interest  of getting my family to eat vegies I added slivered carrots, fresh peas and yellow peppers.

The was delicious! I made a few minor changes to veggies to fit what I had in the fridge (broccoli) and I made more sauce as suggested by others. Flavor was excellent! I would make this again before ordering 'take out'. Amber, Thanks for sharing. Reviewers, Thanks for taking the time to share how you "tweeted" the recipe.

Very tasty food. Being in the UK I couldn't find the bottled teriyaki sauce outlined in this receipe. I reduced that marinade recipe to 4 servings and it went very well with the values outlined in this sesame chicken. Before I floured the meat I actually put a 4-5 tablespoons of marinade on the meat. As this is mostly sugar it both helped flavour the meat and made it sticky enough for the flour to cling to. I didn't have any red pepper flakes so used a teaspoon of peri peri steakhouse pepper. I switched up the green bell pepper for thinly sliced zucchini. The steakhouse pepper gave it a bit of a bite but not too much for those who don't like spicy food. Served with wildrice and mixed veg. Everything else stayed the same and there were clean plates at the end of dinner which is always a good sign. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I have to say, this was very VERY good.  I have a family of 7, so I used about 1/2 cup of both the honey and the Terriaki sauce.  It was, as my son said, "outstanding!"  I will make one suggestion, I reversed the cooking of the veggies and chicken.  I decided to cook the veggies 1st and put them in a mesh strainer while I fried the chicken.  This way the chicken stayed both hot and a bit more crispy.  I used 2 separate pans(one fry pan to saute the veggies and a pot with more oil to deep fry the chicken).   I also added green beans, water chestnuts, baby corn and scallions.  The kids LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!  Thank you Amber!!

Pretty good. The Chinese spice is a must. Chinese spice can be found at any ethnic grocery store for about $2/$3. It consists of cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and anise. I wouldn't recommend mixing it yourself because of the strong flavors. I also doubled the sauce recipe and had to thin it out. I used a mix of more teriyaki sauce and water. I replace red pepper and served this with brown rice i cooked in chx stock.

Prepared as written it was quite good. The only thing I would change is that I wouldn't bread and fry it. I know that is part of what sesame chicken is, but the flavors of oil and the sauce were competing with each other. I never have perfected the art of frying, and the flavor of the sauce is delicious by itself! I would agree with others in saying to double the sauce, and in pre-mixing the honey and teriyaki sauce. I saved some teriyaki sauce from the baked chicken teriyaki recipe on this site and it worked very well! We had it with fried rice and cream cheese wontons. I will definitely make this again!

I liked the method of cooking this but the sauce was way too strong for us.  I did double the sauce but it wasn't the doubling that caused it to be too strong, I think it's just the teriyaki & honey in equal amounts.  My hubby said to take this out of our menu.. not to his liking.

Wow! This was relatively easy and came out great! I did substitue a little bit of ginger for the five-spice because I couldn't find it. Add a little bit of sesame oil into the dish and it is PERFECT!

I chose this recipe primarily because I had the 5 spice powder and hadn't used it yet. It was just ok. I think I might try it next time without the sauce, but am not sure. It wasn't bad, just not spectacular for me and I was trying to find another chicken recipe to use for my husband who isn't a big poultry fan.

Delicious!  Super easy to make.  We tripled the sauce, and no onion - still excellent, though next time I think we'll add garlic and more veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

Like everyone else, increased the amount of sauce.  used 1/2 cup of soy sauce and 1/2 cup of honey instead of the recommended 2 tbs.  Made for an excellent cold breakfast the next day also!!!

Dish was good not great although husband who is picky liked it and ate remaining for left overs. I did change recipe as previous postings suggested to 3 tbsps olive oil with 2 tbsps sesame oil, used peas although I think to much was added, 4 tbsps terriyaki sauce & honey however I will cut the honey count to 2 tbsps next time due to that it made it to sweet. Maybe more red pepper next time with broccoli instead. Will make again - thank you for the recipe.

Really tasty! We made this for dinner the other day and enjoyed it very much. We'll definitely have it again, and maybe try out some of the variations next time.

Definitely not restaurant quality, but still pretty good. Needed more sauce, so I added more teriyaki sauce, a little soy sauce, and a couple dashes of hot sesame oil. Definitely doesn't need more honey. Also used more oil than in the recipe and subbed green beans and some shitake mushrooms for green pepper and pan fried chicken in a mix of vegetable and sesame oil as suggested.

My family loved this!  I used six smaller chicken breasts and quadrupled the sauce. My 16 yr old ate tons of it saying it was better than takeout!  Yay!  Served with brown rice.

This had a great flavor! I doubled the teriyaki sauce and honey but I think I will triple it next time. The chicken soaked up all the sauce very quickly. I didn't put onions or the green bell pepper just because we don't like them. It turned out great and made great leftovers.

It was chicken with a sweet sauce. Not anything special. I would suggest red pepper flakes for some kick. I did not bread the chicken either. Probably won't make again. BUT it wasn't gross, just average.

One of my very favorite recipes.  This is so easy to make and has great leftovers.  My boyfriend and I are both not very fond of peppers and onions so I have done it without any veggies and it is still wonderful.  Impossible to mess this one up

My wife and mother both loved this recipe. It was as good as most restaurants I've been to. I did follow the suggestion of many people to make more of the sauce but I doubled instead of tripled the honey and teriyaki.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  Easy to make and customize to your taste.  I use half the red pepper, and double the teriyake and honey to make more sauce and it's perfect!

Nice blend of salty and sweet, BUT, def. increase teriyaki by three times, I suggest you mix both honey/teriyaki sauce in a small bowl first to make it easier to stir in the sauce as to not let most of it evap off before you get to stir it.

I tripled the sauce recipe.  This recipe was FANTASTIC.  I am glad that red pepper flakes are optional, as my children didn't like the "after-heat", so I will omit that the next time around.  THANK YOU!  This recipe is a keeper and will be repeated often.

This recipe sounded good and had really good reviews, but it didn't turn out as good as expected.  I was really disappointed.  There was not really good flavor.  Also, I coated the chicken with the flour mixture ahead of time and put it in the fridge till dinner, and all the chicken stuck together.I would not make this again.  And, I would not recommend trying it.

5 stars all the way!! I had to use Bisquick, b/c I discovered bugs in my flour (probably haven't used it in 5 months) and it turned out fine. I tripled the sauce, and next time will make more. Also, my husband and I decided to add carrots and snow-peas. He likes veggies, and even though it won't really be "sesame chicken" I think it will still be good. The sauce we all liked. I think this recipe will be made often.

Very good recipe. Was afraid to use the 5 spice with littler ones for guest. I did cut down on the sesame seeds but added some sesame oil when frying to make up for it. Like others I tripled the sauce. Added some thai garlic chile hot sauce for some added kick. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  There was something that I didn't like though and I think it was the 5 spice.  there is something in it that just turns me off....?  Recipe was very good though, especially if you like the 5 spice

I made this true to the recipe,except with extra sauce as most had suggested.  My son gave it "3 thumbs up" but my husband said to next time maybe use a little less of the five spice.

This was so tasty. I had to alter the recipe because I didn't have the same ingredents. I am just letting people know because they might be in my shoes. I used a whole cut up chicken because I didn't have breasts. I used all of the ingredents and baked the chicken for one hour at 350. It turned out great and the left overs made awesome chicken for chinese chicken salad the next night. Great flavor combinations and I will make it again.

I made this recipe this weekend for my husband's birthday.  He absolutely loved it!  It doesn't look like the sesame chicken from our chinese restaurant.  Ours is kind of an orange(ish) color.  This was dark. But it was very good just the same.

This recipe looked beautiful when I was making it.  However it tastes nothing like Sesame Chicken, and I have tasted a lot of Sesame Chicken.  This recipe is neither sweet, nor does it have a kick to it like some Sesame Chicken recipes do, and it has a very weird after-taste to it.  My kids liked it, because they like BLAND food.  If you like bland food and don't really want something that tastes like Sesame Chicken this may just be the dish for you.

GREAT recipe!! I did change it up a little because I did not have some ingridients. I marinated the chicken in Oriental Marinade that I found at my local Tesco. Then I only added abt half a teaspoon of 5spice because this spice is overpowering. The flour had difficulties ahering to the chicken. Not exactly sure how to fix this problem. I got the chicken crispy by leaving it in the wok for about 10mins mixing it occasionally. I added various veggies such as carrots and red peppers. I didn't have any teryaki sauce so i added extra soysauce and just a tablespoon of hoison sauce. Don't forget the honey!! I also sprinkled sesame seeds in the end. Served it over white long rice.

This was delicious!  The Chinese 5 spice powder is expensive ($7) so I opted to use spices I already have (a pinch of cinnamon, ginger, and garlic powder) instead.  FYI... 1/2 cup of sesame seeds ends up being an entire standard-sized spice bottle.  I think less could definitely be used and it wouldn't detract from the recipe.  Also, the chopped onion and pepper, while nice, are optional- especially if you are looking to make the meal more quickly.  I will definitely make this again and share the recipe with my friends!

This was a simple dish to make. I think it needs a little more of something as it tasted a bit bland. What that something is I'm still trying to figure out. I would also make the chicken crispier by adding a thicker coat of flour.

We didn't care for this and threw away the leftovers.  The five spice powder gave this an odd flavor and was an expensive investment.

I've been looking for a good recipe for Sesame chicken and this was quite good... although I had to make about 5x the sauce.  Also, I didn't need nearly the full cup of flour--I ended up throwing a bunch of it out.  But all in all, a really good recipe.

Unbelievably good and not remotely healthy. At lest I know there is no MSG in my food.  I made very minor modifications - doubled the sauce and added chili paste to it.  Also I used sesame oil.  I didn't have bell peppers so I skipped them.  FABULOUS!!!

I was excited to try this recipe, since I love sesame chicken, but I didn't really care for it. Neither did my hubby. I tripled the sauce, like other reviewers suggested, but it ended up being too much. I would suggest doubling instead. Sorry, but I probably won't be making this again.

This recipe was terrific, but the sauce really has to be tripled.  I took that advice from other reviews and was glad I did.  I served it with brown rice and fruit for a wonderful dinner.

I listened to the comments on this one and tripled the sauce. Using the old addage of "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach"... I think my boyfriend loved me a little bit more after he had scoffed all his plate and the little of mine I couldn't manage. Destined to become a regular on my plate methinks. Very very scrummy!

All I can say is "Wow!"  I used three 14-oz. packages of chicken tenders for this recipe and my family of four couldn't get enough of it! We had enough leftover for about one more serving, which my 16-year old promptly wolfed down the next day, much to my husband's dismay (I thought they were going to fight over it!).  I also tripled the sauce (as recommended by other reviewers, added diced red and yellow pepper (instead of the green), along with some garlic, fresh gingerroot and a little oyster sauce.  It was fantastic!  I had to promise my husband I would make this again this week!

This was pretty good. I added broccoli to the veggies. Also, I baked the chicken to cut down some of the fat. The sauce was really boring to me.. I added some soy sauce and Asian chili sauce to it to liven it up a bit.. honestly, for me it wasn't worth the calories.

This was a good recipe but it seemed like something was missing...Overall the chicken turned out really sweet... Would make again but add more red pepper flake and less brown sugar and honey.

This was very tasty.  Definitely don't need all that flour.  I tripled the sauce but it did kind of thicken quickly due to the flour in the wok, so it didn't quite make a "sauce" for rice.. however - it was a great tasting dish.  I can't wait to try it with shrimp!!!

We really liked the flavor of this.  Some of my chicken pieces were sliced too thin and became hard and chewy. I doubled the sauce.  I didn't have the Chinese 5 spice, so I used a combination of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, maybe allspice, can't recall.

I think it was a good starter recipe... i tripled the sauce like most people suggested and it just tasted like a soy sauce mess! I think it would have helped if the chicken were coated in egg first, then flour, because mine didn't taste like a batter (which is part of what I love about sesame chicken). I did love that it called for some spice in the flour because it gave it a great kick. I would recommend using the amount of sauce shown and maybe adding some brown sugar or maple syrup if you like it sweet and sticky. My husband love it either way.

Wow! Simply great! I did a slightly different version by cooking the chicken with a bit of water in a crock pot all day, shredding it and seasoning it with the 5 spice and pepper directly to taste. This avoids frying and it was really wonderful. The chicken does soak up the sauce quickly though so be careful!

Terrific recipe!!  I've been searching for a sesame chicken recipes like this for awhile now.  I'm glad I found this. Even my picky "taste tester" husband thought it was as good as the restaurant style. I, also, used the "Fish & Things Teriyaki Marinade" from this site. Again...YUMMY!!!

Let me some it up with one word...YUM! :)  This recipe was so quick and easy, yet it tastes like I spent hours in the kitchen.  I am a vegetarian and substituted Seitan for chicken and it was just as yummy.

This is a great sesame chicken recipe, but I also made a few changes. I tripled the sauce and used only a dash of red pepper flakes. My sauce was not very sweet at all. Next time I will add some sugar. Served over brown rice.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I add a little more of the crushed red pepper at the end, when I add in the honey.  I always serve this with Jasmine rice and broccoli.

I used firm tofu instead of chicken and it worked out great!  Press the tofu first so it's not so wet.  I also chose broccoli instead of bell pepper and didn't add nearly as much sesame seeds.  This recipe is a new favorite!

I love anything sesame so for me it was ok.  My husband however did not love it and he didn't even finish a plate of it.  I think it was the 5 spice seasoning, it must be an acquired taste. I might try this again without coating the chicken and just using the spice combo in the pan with the chicken in a nonstick skillet.

Finally I've found a new recipe that my son absolutely loves!! I am the proud mother of a 15 almost 16 year old who has a real appreciation for food and loves it when I try new recipes...the only problem is I haven't been able to find any new ones lately that don't include heavy cream...butter or cheese... He was so excited when I served him this for dinner tonight and so was I!! It made my shopping trip to the store today all the more worthwhile!! I read a lot of the other reviews and doubled up on the teryaki sauce and only added an extra tablespoon of honey...we added a little more teryaki sauce and sesame seeds to his plate when he was eating it... Well...I'm off to go work on another dish...an overnite marinade of pork tenderloin... Bon Appetite!!

It was so easy and so tasty!  I was surprised that at how quickly I was able to make it.  I just cooked up some white rice and served it over that.  My whole family loved it.  I made it without the red pepper flakes since my 18 month old was eating too, but having eaten it now, they would be a wonderful addition.  Delicious!

In my opinion-this is much better than take out!  I used soy sauce instead of teriyaki just because I don't like too much sweet in a recipe-I thought the honey and teriyaki would be too sweet for me-so I used tamari soy and honey.  I also took out the peppers because I don't care for them.  Instead I used bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  It was wonderful-I would definately make this one again and may try it with the teriyaki sometime!

The flavor is really fantastic! I would however, recommend at least quadrupling the sauce. I served mine over rice and that way, the sauce can soak into the rice a little. It really was great!

I was looking for a recipe that had sesame seeds; I loved this. Would be even better with white rice next to the dish. Already had some chopped frozen bell pepper in the freezer. I tripled the sauce & added low sodium soy sauce.I fried the chicken in a mixture of sesame oil & veg. oil. Since I didn't have Chinese five spice powder, I googled what it consisted of & there seemed to be slight variations among the results so I stuck with the one that I had all the ingredients I had in my spice cabinet. My "five spice powder" had black pepper, cinnamon, anise seed, ground cloves & ginger. Turned out wonderful but if I ever get my bands on real Chinese five spice powder, I'd like to try it to see the difference.

So good! I did a few things differently though. I marinated my chicken in some of the teriyaki sauce and minced garlic. I let it sit in the fridge for about an hour, then coated with the flour mixture. When I fried the chicken I used sesame oil. Then, with the sauce, I tripled the amount and I also added a little soy sauce to it. This turned out so yummy.

Needed much more teriyaki sauce and honey then called for.  Turned out ok but it really depends on the brand and type of teriyaki sauce you buy.  Added an assortment of other veggies (mushrooms, red peppers, etc).  The pan-frying was time consuming so watch out for this.

I think I did something wrong. Maybe I didn't heat the oil hot enough because the flour coating on the chicken turned into a gooey cakey mess....rather than frying or adhering to the chicken.  The whole thing turned out weird. The flavors were good but the instructions on the recipe did not adequately describe how to cook it.

This recipe is GREAT!  I used 4 chicken breats and like suggested, I doubled the sauce. I added green peppers, snow peas and carrots that were cooked in sesame oil.  The veggies added color and flavor.  My family loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

When I make this recipe the members of my family hover around the kitchen just waiting for the right moment to pounce! I am not kidding. Then they fight for the leftovers the next day. I did triple the sauce so we could serve it over steamed white rice and have plenty of sauce. We love it when the onions seem to carmelize with the honey so i add more onion.

Tasted like it was from a restaurant! Make sure you make lots and lots of sauce. I sprinkled the sesame seeds on last, so they would stick to the outside of the chicken. Excellent!!!

DELICIOUS!!!!  I loved this recipe so much, I cannot contain myself.  I did not use any onion-while cooking, I realized I did not have any!  But it still tasted great.  I also served w/ white rice.

Very VERY good - I did not change a thing (OK - maybe one thing, I added red peppers to the green pepper and onion mix). The 5 spice powder is a must as it adds a very distinct yet mild Asian flavor.  Very easy to make-took no time at all to whip this together. Thanks!

Fabulous!! I agree that you will need to at least triple the honey and teriyaki. I also added 1 tsp of minced ginger. I found that the sesame seeds didn't really stick to the chicken so I might just added them at the end. Also, I would add the honey and teriyaki to the pan first to mix together before adding the chicken. Really tasty!

This one gets all the stars in the night sky! I'll be making it again for an upcoming birthday. 

I didn't double the sauce, but rather used less chicken (4 large chicken breasts). Followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was very moist and tender. PERFECT!

Loved this recipe.  I have never made sesame chicken before, but will be from now on.  My husband and son really liked it, they even liked the green pepper, something they usually won't touch.  The only changes I made were using a store bought teriyaki and I didn't have the red pepper so used just the slightest bit of cayenne.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I did double the sauce as some suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was okay...he liked it. That's all that matters. A little dry though. There was no glaze like how everyone else had theirs. I will have to try again soon, since it's his favorite Chinese dish.

This was pretty good. I cooked only the chicken; Nothing else. It seemed a little bland, but that could have been my own fault. I am not the greatest cook!
  I will make again though. It was pretty tasty.

This was really tasty with steamed snow peas (in the pod) in replace of the green pepper (use two packages from the frozen section at the store). I didn't double the sauce per other reviews, but added a little more honey. I also added some garlic salt to the flour mixture. The chicken would have been too bland without it. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I used fresh ginger instead of the 5 spice and I didn't have chicken so I used shrimp.  Delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.

It was very good. It didn't taste like sesame chicken but I enjoyed it. There were a lot of seeds. I doubled the sauce as well. It was kind of sweet but I will make it again will a few changes.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I prepared it for my wife and I and we had enough left over for lunch the next day. The taste was pretty close to what I usually experience at a traditional Chinese restaurant which surprised me. I had to add a bit more Teriyaki sauce to the mix because the chicken started to dry out but other than that is was great.

With so many different reviews, I made as is.  We thought this turned out very good with the five spice that we buy at an international store that we are lucky to have here.  I did double the sauce and put some to the side.  Yummy.

Great Chicken Recipe.  I took the advice of others and tripled the sauce and it was perfect.  I also didnt'have the Chinese Five-Spice Powder so used fresh ginger - PERFECT......The chicken is so tender you can cut it with a fork.  I will definitely make this again.

Only used 3 thin slice cutlets (which i further sliced into strips) so doubled the sauce.  Followed the recipe exactly (except reducing the flour) and thougt it was very good.  I'm not sure how I feel about the five spice flavor but it was an interesting taste and I would absolutely make it again. Next time, I'm adding fresh pineapple chunks!

Wow! This was an awesome recipe. I thought that it would just taste like a teriyaki chicken recipe with a bit of sweetness from the honey, but it had much more of a kick than that. Unlike other reviews, I actually INCREASED the amount of 5-spice powder and loved the increased flavor it provided. Will absolutely make again!

My family did not like this recipe at all. We didn't like the seaseme seeds fried it changed the flavor of the chicken too much. We couldn't even eat the chicken and my family usually never wastes anything. I will not make this again.

After a few adjustments, my husband and I thought this tasted outstanding. I cut the oil down to 2 tbsp to cut back on fat (it makes the end result a bit sticky, but that doesn't affect the taste), then doubled the five-spice and tripled the honey and teriyaki to make enough sauce

Oh man, this was delicious. I have never come as close to replicating my favorite Chinese dish as I did with this. I followed the directions pretty faithfully, but omitted the onions, and it turned out wonderfully. It is a pretty quick dish for one that is so good.

I hate Five Spice, so I didn't use it. The sauce doesn't make enough, so add more to it. About 3 times as much sauce.

Awesome recipe!  The only thing that I changed was I actually doubled the amount of teriyaki/honey mixture to add to the chicken at the end.  This gave it that really robust chinese restaurant flavor that me and my husband were craving.

This was just OK.  I used the suggested 1 cup of flour but I doubled the spices that were mixed in.  It still could have used more spice - in my opinion.  I could have lived with the amount of spices but what I didn't like about it was that it was toooo sweet.  I omited the honey and added nothing sweet, but it was still too sweet.  Maybe a different teriyaki sauce would be better??  I doubt I will make this again.

Actually this dish was not that bad and I would consider making it again the only drawback came from this dish not being flavorful enough but that can be easily over come by adding extra seasoning

Chicken had a good flavor but no sauce for the rice.  I'm not sure to what exponent I would have to make sauce in order to suit my family.  We liked it except for that, though.  Thanks!

I would give this ten stars.  I really didn't expect it too be this good.  I was surprised.  This was the only recipe for sesame chicken here that I had everything for so I went ahead with it.  I don't need to ever look for any other recipe.  It's easy to increase the amount of sauce if you like it that way.

Was very good, with no left-overs.  I 4x the sauce like others and used chicken wings instead of chicken breasts.  The wings are very sticky and messy, but worth it.  Thanks

Very Flavorfull and fun recipe! Though I would suggest a pineapple teriyaki sause as opposed to a plain teriyaki,
that way it doesn't become too salty. But over all a great recipie that was enjoyed by the whole family.

I just made this and my family just loved it. I think next time I will substitute the peppers for brocolli. I found if you moisten the meat w. water or milk the sesame seeds adhere to it really well. i served with rice & string beans. very good!

I turned this into an appetizer to go with an oriental party pack, so i omitted the pepper and onion. This recipe was easy to make, and tasted like you put a lot more effort into it. Excellent!!

Ok, Ok, so I didnt follow the recipe, only because I couldnt find the chinese five spice. I didnt think it would work out if I omitted it so I got resourceful and went to my local Hannaford where I found their brand of Inspirations sesame ginger sauce, I mixed this with the honey and sesame seeds called for in the recipe and my family went nuts! it was soooooooo good, and we all swore it was better than take out, this is an excellent recipe modified or not! If I could find the chinese five spice I would make it both ways but this was truly a great recipe, the chicken was so tender! I served it alongside some oriental style rice and it was a very delicious and filling dinner!

Very quick and easy meal that my family loved.  Even the kids gobbled this down.  I used peanut oil and sesame oil to cook the chicken in instead of vegetable oil for a more authentic flavor.  Also, couldn't find some of the seasonings so I improvised with what I had around.  This recipe was very flexible.  Yum!

This is very good. I too tripled the teriyaki sauce and the honey.  I also forgot to put in the red pepper flakes, but I did not miss them.  This was really good served over rice.  I will make again!:)  Thanks for sharing:)

Love it. We did take suggestion of others & doubled the sauce. We added mushrooms & sugar snap peas. I don't know if anyone else has, but we put this over rice & won't do that again. Next time it'll just be by itself, & do egg rolls for a compliment to it.

My husband loved this! I omitted the onion and bell pepper, quadrupled the sauce, and added some extra cayenne pepper. I give it 4 stars because that's what the recipe given here deserves. With the modifications, it's definitely FIVE!!

I found this too sweet for my taste--probably because of the five spice. I might try it again with ginger instead, but am not in a rush to make it again. It was a decent meal.

Thanks for the recipe. It was good but I added a little too much 5 spice....so be carefull when adding this! I also added steamed fresh broccoli on the side of the dishes for some color and crunch. Great Addition!  Thanks.

This recipe is a fabulous idea, but I haven't gotten consistent results with it. More specific cooking instructions would be helpful. Meanwhile, I'm using trial and error to develop a more stable version. Definitely a keeper with changes!

Kudos, KREALTOR!  This has been a pet peeve of mine forever!  It seems as if a person can't get their own recipe published, they do it in a review of one that's close to theirs.  Personally, we tried this sesame chicken - and our family adored it.  Keep reviewing KREALTOR, and Amber - thanks for a great recipe.  Its great just like it is

Excellent recipe.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms, and a can of baby corn cut in half.  In addition to the teriyaki and honey I through in good dolop of hoisen sauce.  The chicken done this way was as tender as I have ever tasted.  This one is a keeper.  I may throw in some chow mein noodles next time for a litle more volume

Amber this is a great recipe. My family loved it. I did double the sauce and got it off the heat quickly to minimize reducing the quantity. Will definitely make again.

Everyone I make this for says it's good enough to be in a resturant. I have adapted the recipe a bit to my likings, but it's a great guide for asian cooking. Enjoy!

Too woodsy of a taste, maybe try adding some orange sauce.

Near perfection, even by my superior standards.
