Just as a note, this bread CANNOT be used to make Roman Catholic Communion hosts. Catholic hosts MUST be made with ONLY wheat flour and water, any other ingredients render the bread unsuitable for the Roman Catholic Mass and will invalidate the Mass.

Just in case someone wants the exact citation: "The Code of Canon Law Canon 924 requires that the hosts be made from wheat flour and water only." Ye Olde Wikipedia:) And the bread is good (on its own merits).

I'm interested about the comments made by RAEVER_BOY...as a lifelong Catholic, I've eaten this kind of leavened bread at the Eucharist many times (though wafers are by far the norm.)  If someone WERE to make this bread for Roman Catholic communion services, I'm sure a quick phone call to the parish priest beforehand would assuage any doubts.

Mmmm so good. I actually made biscuits out of this recipe because the ingredients were the only ones I had. Split them up into small balls and baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes. So easy & delicious!

This is a tasty alternative to what my Protestant colleagues refer to as "styrofoam disks" in the Catholic tradition! For those preoccupied with rubrics and canonical norms this bread is perfectly acceptable for Catholic use. The only canons referring to bread state that the bread must be made of "unblemished wheat". There is no mention of other ingredients thus the use of this recipe is perfectly "valid" not mention delicious for Catholic Mass.

I attend a Evangelical Presbyterian Church and last spring I became the deacon in charge of communion preparation. We have been using this bread since our Maundy Thursday service in 2002. We have two services on Sunday so I upsized the recipe a little so I can make 2 small loaves for the pastor to use in the liturgy and 1 large loaf that I can cut into smaller pieces. Constantly get favorable comments on the bread. Much easier to make since I got a mixer with a bread hook.

This bread is absolutley deliscious!  I made it for my sister's first Communion service/party, and everyone loved it!  The honey gives it a faint sweetness, and it's very, very easy to make.

I made this recipe for the Recipe Photo contest. It is wonderful! There are so many things about it that I love. It is very quick and easy to put together doesn't require rising time but still has all the tasty qualities of homemade bread (the crust is delicious!) Since it is slightly sweet we really enjoyed it with some jam on top. We will make this many time again- thanks!

Tastes much like a large biscuit. A little doughy though. Crust is great however.

I recently taught the cooking rotation in our Sunday school program when the kids were learning about "Give us this day our daily bread." I quickly nixed all of the suggested bread recipes because they took too long. Instead I used this one which the kids (and their parents) really seemed to like. To save time I made the dough at home then the kids finished kneading it and shaped it into biscuit-sized loaves which baked in 10-15 minutes. My family liked the recipe so much that I will be sure to use it again at home!

Quick easy to make. Sweet bread mine was a little doughy still in the center which may have been from not cooking long enough. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent and easy! I patted it out into 2 discs pricked the top with a fork and baked until very light brown. At my church we cut it up into bite-sized squares for communion.

mine was pretty dense but i didn't really mind. It was easy to make. The flavor is good and It's sweeter than I expected it to be. I made this bread one day when there was 3 feet of snow outside. I really wanted to make some bread but I didn't have any eggs milk or yeast. Overall I liked this bread and so did my family.

Tried this recipe once before and it was way too doughy so I tried again and added an extra cup of flour and reduced all the liquids by a bit then after I baked it it came out golden brown on top but hadn't even started to cook on the inside.
