I have made this for many years only using texas toast.   Just slice horizontally part way thru the slice of bread and put your cream cheese and fruit in side.  Wonderful.

Good but there's too much cream cheese.  Next time, I will use half the amount of cream cheese but still use 2 T. brown sugar since it wasn't sweet enough for my kids' taste.

I cut this down to one serving, but otherwise made this exactly as stated. This was absolutely delicious! It's not overly sweet. I served this with whipped cream and extra almonds and blueberries. Thanks for a great recipe!

Because it was a sandwich, egg did not soak all the way through the bread, so the bread was kind of dry on the inside.

To get rid of the richness of the cream cheese, try using Mascarpone cheese instead.. it is similar in texture, but has a milder taste and isn't so heavy. Delicious!

The cream cheese mixture was a little too much, but I'm sure it would be great with just a little less.  Whole wheat bread holds up well, and the taste tones down the sweetness a bit.

Really good breakfast.  The only things I would change would be to use less cream cheese (way too much for our likings) and use a different bread so that it wasn't so soggy. Overall, really good and glad we tried something new! My husband I were pleased. Thanks for sharing!

Very nice, but I make some alterations to meet my preferences.  I don't like a lot of filling so I get 2 extra "sandwiches" out of this recipe.  Also, one more egg and less milk in the dipping mixture.  The almonds and lemon juice are an important and delicious part!

This was good but for my liking I would leave out the almonds next time and add a bit more Brown sugar.

If you have a sweet tooth you will LOVE this!! I use a bit more brown sugar then it calls for, just for our own personal taste. Extremely filling and satisfying. YUMMY

I've made this twice when we've had company and got rave reviews both time. It's definitely not a low calorie dish, but for an occasional treat I think it's great. I used French bread and it worked just fine.

I was so disappointed with how this turned out. First of all, the mixture needs at least twice the amount of brown sugar and less cream cheese. Not only was the filling not sweet enough, even with the blueberries, but it was way too much. It didn't seem like it was going to be that much when I was spreading it on, but once it cooked there I realized how much it really was. Also, the dipping mixture made the bread WAY too soggy, so it took forever to cook and it dried out the bread too much. There was no nice eggy coating like there is on traditional French toast. It just turned out to be one big sloppy mess and made flipping the sandwiches a pain. I think next time I'd omit the milk completely, IF I ever try this recipe again.

Husband approved!  I omitted the vanilla by mistake but it was sweet and tasty enough.  Served with No-sugar added maple syrup.  Yum!!

I made it with no almonds and bananas instead of blueberries. It was great my wife and two girls loved it. Gonna try strawberries and bananas on the next one.

I got six sandwiches out of this recipe by just putting the cream cheese on one side. That was actually plenty of "filling." I also used a whole-milk creamer instead of milk to make it richer. You could add flavor by doing this (vanilla, almond, etc.) My children ages 3, 6 and 8 all loved it. Yum!

I made a few changes due to other reviewers comments.  I made 1/2 a recipe for just the 2 of us using sliced Italian bread.  I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and less filling in between the bread so to avoid the excess oozing out.  It was just perfect for us.  Used frozen blueberries that were flash frozen last Summer.  So good!
