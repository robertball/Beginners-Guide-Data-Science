bubble tea is made with much larger tapioca, it can be purchased online, in Asian markets, or made yourself. the tapioca called for in this recipe will not produce bubble tea like you would purchase.

Besides the tapioca pearls, the tea is pretty good. I’m pretty sure I got the wrong kind of pearls because they took over a half hour to cook, they were sticky and slimy and just didn’t go well with the tea. But over all the tea was good. If I were to make this again, I would not add the pearls and instead of black tea, I would try chi tea.

1.19.17  I’ve never had bubble tea before, so I Googled Quick Cooking Pearl Tapioca, and Minute Maid® (which I had on hand) came up, so that’s what I used.  The tapioca congealed into clumps in the boiling water; there was no draining the pearls.  When I tried to drink the tea, the tapioca clogged up the straw, so I have to think I didn’t use the right pearl tapioca.  Next time I’m near the Asian market I’ll stop in, and see what they have for pearl tapioca and, perhaps, try this again.  In spite of that, the taste was still pretty good.

I make a simple syrup (boiling 1 to 1 cup of white sugar and water) to put the pearls in as they cool. You add the soaked pearls and some of the syrup to the tea and condensed milk for a smoother taste/texture. I've also used other flavored teas (mango black tea is my favorite).
