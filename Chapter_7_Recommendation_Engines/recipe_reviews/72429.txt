This is one of my favorite sides. Super easy to make and tastes delicious.  I always double the recipe for leftovers and I also add squash and about a teaspoon of Mrs Dash while it's cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

I actually used sun-dried tomato vinaigrette (all I had in the cabinet) and loved it!  I had some leftover zucchini/squash from a casserole I made, realized I had all the ingredients for this recipe, and was quite pleased with the results!  Very easy (always a plus!) and went over quite well.  I served it as a "summer supper" with corn on the cob, fresh tomatoes, and some meatballs.  I even added some mushrooms to the recipe at the last minute, because they were about to go bad.  I'm excited about this one because I feel like it can work with a lot of different ingredients (yet another plus - woot, woot!) so that makes me happy.  Very happy, actually.  Now.  Where DID I put those leftovers?  Hee hee.

I like zucchini, & this recipe is very nice. But, when I think of slaw, I think 'raw'. I hadn't thought of it, prior to seeing the title of this recipe, for some reason. After all,there is broccoli slaw. So, I plan to see how I like raw zucchini slaw.

I don't even like Zucchinis but I had alot leftover after making Zucchini bread and chose this recipe.  It is GREAT as a topping for beef (I had sliced beef); I am going to try this slaw on a mushroom burger after the holidays, I bet it would be great.  I didn't so much like it on the side.

This has a nice fresh taste to it. I followed the ingredients exactly but changed technique based on personal preference. My husband likes his zucchini to be crisp and not mushy. What I did to achieve this was to sautee the onions until soft and then threw the zucchini in for a quick cook.I imagine individual results will vary depending upon the quality of your dressing. We had some Olive Garden dressing and used that. I did add a little salt and pepper at the table. Nice and tasty!

I liked this recipe OK, and I would definitely make it again.  I think I will add some mushrooms and tomatoes, and maybe even black olives to make it more substantial next time.  

I did cook mine on medium, which made the zucchini brown and the onion caramelize a bit, but I really enjoyed those flavors.

This is great. I added 1 squash and used Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar dressing instead. Added salt to taste. I liked it as a side and can see it used as a relish on top of a meat dish.
