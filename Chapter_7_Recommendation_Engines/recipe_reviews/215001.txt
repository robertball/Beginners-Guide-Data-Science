We love this coleslaw in our home! We tried it to use up kohlrabi, which we had no idea what to do with.  The dressing is light, but just enough.  I actually use a combo of honey and stevia in place of the sugar.  We've made it 3 or 4 times now and eat it up every time.

What a fun recipe! I enlisted the whole family to peel and chop. We are new fans of kohrabi and, as I suspected, it makes great coleslaw! I didn't have any mayo, so had to substitute Miracle Whip and cut the sugar back to 2 T. I'll try it again with mayo next week. I really liked how this recipe goes light on the dressing, giving us a much leaner, fresher tasting salad. This makes a couple quarts of slaw.

Not a fan of raw celery, so I left it out and didn't miss it. Used food processor to grate all veggies quickly. A fabulous slaw!

This was excellent! I had a kohlrabi from the organic produce box from the school. I went from having never cooked with it, to using this recipe first-time as I hosted Easter! Everyone in the family loved it!

The carrots add a nice pop of color--it has a very nice presentation, as well as tasting good, this slaw.

Wonderful flavor.  This is the first time I have ever used kohlrabi and I grew it this year in the garden.  I made no changes to the recipe. Very Good

Excellent! Great way to use kohlrabi. My husband LOVES kohlrabi - he'll eat them like an apple - so he loved this slaw. I added a splash of milk to make it a little more wet. Instead of grating the kohlrabi I sliced if very thin using a mandoline. Yum. Thanks :)

Yum! I was hesitant to try this with only 2 reviews and no photo. But this was delicious. I didn't have as much kohlrabi as suggested, so I increased the cabbage a bit (I used Napa cabbage). Otherwise, everything was as written. I grated the carrots and I have a mandolin to slice the celery paper thin. I will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly minus the celery seed since I didn't have any. So good! The dressing is nice and tangy. My friend said it was the best riff on a traditional coleslaw she's ever had! Took a while to cut and grate everything, but so worthwhile. Great recipe.

I made some minor changes to this recipe:  1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/3, and 1/2 teaspoon celery seed instead of 1/8.
Reminds me of a coleslaw an old girlfriend made for me 40 years ago!

Took WAY to long to prepare & taste wasn't worth it. Rather bland. Won't be buying kohlrabi again.

My family and I loved this, and I don't usually like coleslaw. The first time I made it, I used kholrabi, cabbage, and carrots. I subbed agave for the sugar, and didn't add celery seed because I didn't have any on hand. It turned out great! The quick version: buy a bag of pre-chopped "coleslaw" (cabbage and carrots) and add your ingredients from there. This recipe is delicious and definitely a keeper for us!

I had never had kohlrabi before, but this was great. Our dinner guest had a hearty second helping, and he'd never had it before either. We used normal vinegar and omitted the celery seed, but it was fine without. I think apple cider vinegar would definitely add a little something though.

Made this when we got kohlrabi from our CSA because I really wasn't sure what to do with it, and my hubby went nuts for it! He looks forward to the weeks we get kohlrabi now.

I had no idea what to do with the kohlrabi in my CSA box bit this recipe was DELICIOUS! Thank you for sharing! I will definitely be making this again even if I don't have kohlrabi and just use cabbage.

The only thing I didn't use was the kohlrabi (never heard of it before today) and I added extra celery (not a huge fan of celery but wanted to use what I had before it went bad and it worked PERFECT with this recipe -blended in so well).  I love coleslaw and we most def make this one again.

Every time I make this it gets rave reviews. Be prepared to hand out the recipe. I have even made it without the kohlrabi and just used cabbage instead and everyone still loves it. I also sometimes use part veganaise part mayo. Always a hit.

I like the combination of kohlrabi with cabbage. It adds a subtle sweetness to the slaw. The dressing is one the sweet side, but that's how I like it. Add some extra fresh cracked black pepper and this is a great side for summer meals.

A little bit to sweet, a 1/4 cup would probably be the perfect balance. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this. I added more celery seed, almost triple the amount. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious - don't leave out the kohlrabi, its flavor is important.  I used 2 Tablespoons of agave nectar instead of sugar giving a beautiful light brown glaze to vegetables.

This was delicious. I made exactly as it says but I rinsed my onions through a sieve. Jacque Pepin suggested it for anything you put raw onion into and its a great tip to take away that severe overpowering taste without losing flavor.

I used xylitol in place of the white sugar and used Hain's safflower mayonnaise. It was absolutely the best coleslaw I have ever tasted! I will be making this again and again!

If you have a garden, try growing kohlrabi.  If you grow kohlrabi, try making this slaw!  It's fantastic. I was nervous about serving it at a party (since I had never made it before),  so I made traditional cole slaw also. This one was the winner, hands down.  I cheated a bit and used bagged coleslaw mix in place of the sliced cabbage and carrots.

I used red cabbage. Made the slaw with extra celery seed and about 1/4 tsp of celery salt. otherwise, followed the recipe. Didn't think the dressing was going to be enough but it was just right if you like a light dressing. Definitely will make this again. It would be nice to take to a pot luck for people to try kohlrabi.

My family loved this slaw.  I didn't have any kohlrabi so I increased the cabbage to 5 cups and added about 8 to 10 chopped Kalamata Olives.  It added just that right amount of sour to offset the sweetness.  I have never had kohlrabi before but will definitely try it with this recipe next time and there will be lots of next times.

Used about double the cabbage; the kohlrabi came through just right. Will continue making it as long as our gardening friend brings kohlrabi

I've made this a couple of times now and the recipe has helped me fall in love with kohlrabi. My husband is generally picky about vegetables but enjoys this slaw. I do not add in the celery but instead add some extra carrot & cabbage. Making it again for the Independence Day weekend!

This is quite good! I had more cabbage than kohlrabi on hand and I was out of onions, but it still turned out tasty enough to spring on non-veggie-loving friends.
