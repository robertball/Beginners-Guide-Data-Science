OMG SO SO GOOD!!!! Let me start off by saying I was very skeptical about this recipe. I just put down my fork and yet I want more. This recipe is such a surprise you will be blown away by the flavor.. Love love love this recipe!**Update we made this recipe again for the thousand time, this time we seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper omitted the honey mustard and used just a small amount of ranch dressing in it's place. Everything else we kept the same and it turned out AMAZING! It tastes like our favorite pizza from straw hat pizza the lemon pepper chicken pizza this is how we will be making this recipe from now on it's so delicious

Just made this for dinner this evening.  Recipe is true to the text.  Start to finish took me 1hr 15min!  Instead of slicing the onion, I fine diced it & sauteed it. (Our family doesn't like chunks of onion.  Putting the onion in a food processor gives the flavor without the texture.)  That was our only change.  The honey Dijon mustard gives it just the right amount of sweet kick...and my kids don't like mustard.  They gobbled it up.

I thought this was delicious.  I made it for my whole family and they all loved it.  Next time I may add one more egg just as a personal preference but other than that it was fantastic!

This is a great tasting recipe. I made it exactly as written the first time and then made a couple of changes tonight just to suit my own taste. I added 2/3 cup of milk to the egg mixture to make a little more custard. It covers the dish a little better and I used muenster cheese instead of mozzarella for the top. If you have dental work like I do mozzarella is hard to handle. It strings and sticks to the place of choking you. I found a long time ago that muenster cheese has pretty much the same taste without the sticking qualities. Neither the milk nor the change in cheese detracted from the taste. A very good recipe and good with salsa served along side. Thanks for sharing.

Yum! I layed the excess dough over the edges and rolled up around the casserole to make a crescent roll crust. Looks as great as it tastes. The honey mustard was a tasty surprise and I used honey Dijon mustard. If you can't find it just use Dijon and add honey to it. This is now one of my top favorite casserole dishes, family thinks so too.

this was delicious!  i cut the chicken breast into pieces with salt and pepper and then baked it @425 for 25 mins.  I steamed the zuccini and then added the chicken and zuccuni to the onion mix.  I only used 1 can of biscuits because that was all i had and just smooshed them into a 9x13 pan and then drizzled honey mustard on top of them. topped with the chicken mix and then when i did the egg mix with the seasonings, i only used 2 eggs (because thats all i had).  i also topped it with cheddar cheese instead!  i also topped it with a sprinkle of salt!  very tasty!!!

I followed the recipe to the tee but my dish came out dry, like it needed more cheese or maybe a can of mushroom soup added to it. It did taste good though.

Not my favorite. My husband liked it but my kids didn't. If I ever make it again (big IF) I'll use honey mustard instead of honey Dijon- just a personal taste.

This is not a keeper for our family.  Unlike another reviewer I found this recipe to be slightly on the watery side.  I did add milk to the egg mixture per another reviewer (skip it).  I also believe another factor in the moister is the zucchini.  Every time I make zucchini bread I press as much water out of the zucchini as possible (there is not a step or recommendations on recuding moisture coming from the zucchini).  I would recommend reducing the amount of zucchini as well as pat dry the zucchini slices.  Another factor that we didn't care for is the bottom "crust" which had soaked up part of that moisture.  One thought would be to slightly pre-bake the "crust" before adding the contents.

We love this recipe.  Have made it several times in the past month.  For some reason I doubled the egg mixture the first time I made it so I still do that.  I also have added mushrooms.  But the recipe as written is great!  Very much a keeper!

My husband said it was delicious! He doesn't like zucchini, so that's quite a compliment. My half didn't have cheese, but it was tasty. I love zucchini and googled recipes to help me use it. This was perfect. I also made it in a 9x13 and just cut back on ingredients.

Don't hate me for changing this a little & rating it, but I rate and refer back to my own notes when making recipes again. I didn't have any eggs, so I used the 1 can of crescent rolls I had & spread in a 9x13 pan. Added the honey mustard, and sauteed zucchini with mushrooms (no onions due to allergies) and yellow squash. I poked fork holes and baked the crust 10 mins on 375, then added the honey mustard and chicken/veggie mixture. Put shredded cheese (only 4 oz) on top and baked 12 more minutes to melt the cheese. Everyone except DS loved it; made enough for 2 meals. Next time I'll have eggs and make it per directions, and I think it'll be like a quiche.

This was a great recipe to use up some of the zucchini. Both of our kids are not big on zucchini and they both ate it and liked it. I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and Garlic salt for the garlic powder and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was really good. My ten year old son absolutely loved it! I used shredded rotisserie chicken, mixed squash and zucchini, and only used about half the cheese. This is great comfort food and we will make it again!

This was good but I think it would have been better if the zucchini had been stir fried with the onions instead of boiling......too mushy for my taste.  I intend to try that the next time I make it.

Cut recipe in half and used a 9x13 glass dish.  For the onion we mixed green, red and yellow onions equaling ½ an onion.  The Chicken breast was sauté with the onion mixture, 6 ounces of Canadian bacon finely minced and ¼ TSP of fresh garlic.  Zucchini was then added along with 12 oz condensed cream of mushroom soup.  Cooked the ingredients together for 5 minutes.  Reduced the amount of Mozzarella sprinkled on top to 6 oz. Put in the refrigerator over night for dinner the following day.  A bit disappointed inside was good but very runny.  If I make it again I will reduce the amount of zucchini in half and use a 1/4 the amount of mushroom base.  This would be a good recipe for a chicken pot pie type application with the refrigerated crescent roll dough on top.

I loved this recipe!  I don't know how anyone could find this bland.  If you season it appropriately it is wonderful.  It definitely will be a recipe that would be great for entertaining.  It was too much for my husband and I, however, it did last for two dinners.  That is always a blessing.  The only thing I did differently was that I seasoned it a bit more to go with our particular tastes.  But I think everyone does this typically with any recipe.  Thank you DebbieJoe for a wonderful recipe!!!

Thumbs Up!  I have to agree with most the other reviews ~ this was fantastic!  I used my 9 x 13 glass baking dish, quartered my zucchini slices which were about 1/4" thick and didn't over steam the zucchini, then I used a 12oz can of chicken to save time.  I thought it might be runny, but no.  Even my 2 year old loved this! Yummy!!! Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night.  I halved the recipe and cooked it in a 7 X 11 pan.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It looked beautiful and the flavor was good but couldn't really taste the honey mustard.  Since the original recipe calls for 3 eggs and I was halfing it, I went ahead and used 2 whole eggs in my "half recipe" and it was still a little on the dry side.  This may have been because I used a store brand of crescent rolls and they tend to be a little drier than Pillsbury.  So I would recommend using a high quality crescent roll.  My daughter who doesn't really care for squash of any kind said it was good and had 2 helpings.

This is a good meal.  I used a 9x13 pan, so only 1 can of rolls and that was fine.  Used 3 chicken breasts and boiled them in some chicken broth first.  Also only used about 1 cup of cheese.  I added salt, pepper, basil, and garlic powder to the chicken zucchini combo too, to give is more flavor.  Couldn't taste the honey mustard at all.

Very good recipe.  I made it as the recipe is written.  However, it would be very easy to alter to your taste.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was a huge hit with my kids. I used several suggestions from other reviewers - Used 1 package of crust and only half of second to fit in the pan, prebaked it about 5 minutes.
 I was worried about dish being too watery. So I spiralized zucchini and yellow squash and sautéed with the onion.  I added some minced garlic at the end.  It probably does not need 1/4 cup butter. I drained some liquid off. 
I used an extra egg and added some half and half.  Seasoned eggs with the  salt, pepper, and 1/2 tsp Italian herb mix.  
I would not eliminate the honey Dijon, unless you don't like the flavor in general. It was a significant flavor and a good balance.

I’m sure this recipe is delicious as is, but I made quite a few changes. I’ve been trying to stay a little healthier, so I don’t have any crescent rolls on hand and decided to omit them completely. I used a rotisserie chicken, which I broke into pieces, removing the skin. I sliced up a whole onion as well as one bunch of green onions, and sliced two large zucchinis into 1/2 lengthwise then into 1/2 circles. I sautéed the white onion first, added the zucchini, added the chicken, then added the green onions. Everything was softened but not overly mushy. I spread all that into a 9x13 Pyrex dish. Then I whisked the eggs together with some buttermilk (could use any type of milk - I just had some that needed to be used up), all of the recommended spices plus a lil more, as well as 2T whole seed dijon mustard (not honey mustard). I poured it on top of the chicken vegetable mixture, making sure it was spread evenly. I then used grated parmesan instead of mozzarella, sprinkling that evenly over the top. I baked for about 25 minutes then popped into the broiler for another 5 minutes or so. It’s pretty good! I would liken it to a crustless quiche kind of thing, best paired with a mixed green salad. You could probably add fresh salsa or tomatoes after. Overall, I would make again, adding more veggies - sautéed mushrooms and spinach would be delicious! Sausage could mix well too. There is a lot of room for improvisation with this dish.

It was okay. I needed to drain the zucchini for about 20 minutes after cooking.  I don’t think I would make it again.

So we ( my wife and I ) made this exactly per the recipe. We did not make any changes. After coming out of the oven, we let it cool a bit. So my family tried this and did not care for it. Everyone thought the same thing that it is missing something. I myself could instantly taste the garlic powder. I did use the honey dejon mustard and could not taste it. I could not taste the others as well; the oregano, basil, salt, and paper. But the garlic powder I could taste very heavily.  My wife refuses to make it again. I honestly think that if the chicken was flavored first with a chicken seasoning or an Italian seasoning that it may add more flavor. I had also tried two more pieces one with the Herdez Salsa Verde and the other with the Herdez Salsa Verde and a dollop of daisy ( sour cream ). Eating it  this way tasted like enchiladas. Although my wife refuses to make it again, I would try it again, but season the chicken first and chang out the garlic powder for onion powder. And I would tweak it just a little bit for all our tastes. Then I would re-rate this a better star(s).

I think the recipe left out the step where you bake the crescent roll layer before you add the filling. The recipe calls for you to bake everything for 20 minutes, but when I took it out of the oven, the bottom was raw.

Made this but didn't have the crescent rolls so I made the chicken mixture and put that in bottom of dish, then sliced zucchini and put that on top of chicken, then sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top of the zucchini. Turned out great.

Surprisingly very good. I did use marinated left over Cornish hen and it added to the taste so if I use chicken next time I will have make sure it is not just plain. Even my son liked it. I only used 1 can of crescent rolls in 13x11 cake pan and baked it at 375 until the casserole was brown on top including the middle. Be sure and do the onions as requested it adds to the taste.

I wanted to make this gluten-free, so I substituted a package of cooked brown rice spaghetti for the crescent rolls. It was very good!  I sauted the onions and zucchini, and took the advice of using 4 eggs. I also had some cream I wanted to use up, so added 1/2 cup to the egg mixture.  Chopped up a fresh tomato, that I also wanted to use up, and sprinkled it on top before the egg mixture was poured on. It was great! Very versatile and substitute-welcome recipe! Thanks!

This was very good! I made a couple of changes from other reviews. I only had one can of the rolls so used that & a 10x10 pan because it fit in my toaster oven. I let the zucchini drain with a little salt on in for about 20 minutes before cooking it with the onion mixture. I also added some chopped Anaheim pepper to the onions because we love the flavor. I included about 1/2 cup of milk with the eggs. No butter in mine, just some olive oil to cook with the onions. The texture was excellent, not runny or too liquid at all. I also used some cheddar cheese with the motzzarella. Great flavors together.

I thought this was pretty good. I was trying to use up some shredded chicken and yellow squash and this was perfect. I cut it in half and used a 9 x 13" pan and it fit perfectly. I drained the squash pretty well and didn't end up with a soggy crust like some reviewers (but upon reheating it the next morning it was SUPER soggy). While I thought this was very good, I live with three picky eaters who didn't like it, so I don't know if I"ll be making it again. Maybe for a brunch with friends :)

I made this tonight and it was a big hit with everyone. I didn't have the honey mustard so I used ranch dressing. Also, 3 eggs was not near enough to cover so I had to add 2 more. I didn't have mozzarella but I did have Colby-Jack. I only gave 4 stars because I thought it was kind of a pain to make. Not difficult by any means, just a lot of steps.

Love this recipe.
 I made the original recipe several times, and have now made a few changes. I prefer to  sautee the zucchini with the onion along with some Italian spices.
Being more gluten conscious lately, I substitute the Pillsbury crust for a hash brown crust.  I lightly sautee frozen hash browns in some olive oil, season with salt and pepper, then press into a pan. Then, follow the original directions. YUM! Freezes well also.

I didn't like the mustard.  Another review suggested ranch dressing, may try this again with ranch. Sauted Veggies with onions and mixed with the chicken they were perfect.

Very good! It's amazing how much flavor the honey mustard adds! I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 9 inch pie plate. I sauteed the chicken with bouquet garni seasoning blend. I also diced the onions (personal preference). Next time I may chop the zucchini instead of just slicing. Thanks for a great recipe!
