Good recipe, just touched it up a bit.  I used half almond flour and half all purpose flour for the crust and added an extra egg yolk to the filling.  Also, by using 1/8 cup of brown sugar and 1/8 cup confectioners sugar in the crust mixture, I was able to cut the filling sugar down to 3/4 cup.  Added an extra egg yolk to the filling as well to make it more custard-y.  It was awesome I will definitely make this again.

This tart was a big hit at my house.  I used a nonstick tart pan with a removable bottom for a nice presentation, and had no problem with the moistness of the dough.  I love lemon, so I used a little extra juice and zest, which was a nice counterpoint to the sweet crust.  This was simple to make and I will definitely make it again.

I made four individual tarts and, unfortunately, didn’t compensate enough for a change in cooking time.  When you pre-cook your crust, don’t let it brown too much, otherwise, after filling and baking again, it will be too brown (my bad).  I set the timer for 15 minutes and my tart filling was overcooked, so next time, I will check for doneness at 10 minutes.  I did substitute Truvia Baking Blend for the white sugar which worked out fine and added 4 Tbsp of lemon juice (one lemon) instead of 3 Tbsp.  Very nice and really very simple.

After reviewing several lemon tart recipes I chose this one to make and it gets 5+ stars!  It was simple to make and absolutely delicious, as well as looked beautiful on a pretty plate.  I served mixed berries and fresh cream on the side.  This will be in my favorites file, to bake for guests and family.

For those who have a problem with the pastry, it's important to cream the butter and confectioners sugar well, and mix in the flour til it's like "putty".   Then it's easy to pat into a greased pan .... and a hint when squeezing fresh lemons is to put them in the microwave for 15 seconds as the juice flows more freely.  One lemon gave me almost 4 tablespoons of juice.

had a lot of trouble pressing the dough into the pan - it kept crumbling and not adhering to the bottom of the pan (I used a glass pan). Finally found I could get it to stick if I used a fork dipped into hot water. Kind of a pain :{

This turned out perfectly. And is so simple to make. We have so many lemons in our tree and this is a great recipe to use them for. Today I am making just the filling in individual ramekins and topping with whipped cream; saving calories. Yum!

This was delightful ! Based on reading all reviews I added a 1/2 t almond extract to crust, reduced sugar to 3/4 cup ( I just prefer things not so sweet )) & like others suggested 4 T or whatever comes out of the lemons that you use.
I also found that since crust was sticky, I put it directly in pan w/ spatula & used a T to smooth out & it was easy. Didn't need to touch. Served with mixed berries (  mix ahead w/a "little" bit of brandy/sugar depending on sweetness of berries) &  
whipped cream. Berries room temp.....

This tart was delicious but my crust shrank around the edges so the tart scalloped edge was not recognizable. I did refrigerate the dough before working it into the pan and before baking it off.

I used more lemon juice, as others had suggested; glad I did. I baked this in a layer cake pan, and it was rather thin. I'm sure an 8x8 pan would have made it even skinnier. I overbaked a bit, and that was a mistake. I's worth making it again, and just watch the time better.

This is a lovely recipe! We added more zest and lemon juice to make it even more flavourful.

I loved this recipe! So easy.
Actually I used frozen mini tart shells and just made the filling.
A very quick dessert for a sweet tooth or having company over.

Delicious! I amended as one of the reviewers suggested ( half half flour and almond flour, extra egg yolk to the filling ).. Some reviewers mentioned that dough was hard to with as it was sticky. I had the same issue but just added a little extra flour and kept working it into the dough until it was perfect consistency and not sticky. For measure I think it was extra couple of tablespoons of flour that made the difference.

I made this for Easter dessert. It was very good. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For some reason it seemed as though it could have used a little more filling but it tasted lovely. I used about 4T lemon juice because that's how much I got from one lemon-- I didn't want to waste any of it. My only gripe is that it didn't want to come out of the pan. So it wasn't pretty when it got onto the plate but I am not sure anyone noticed--it was gone too fast. It was a lovely and light dessert. Yum.

Excellent-I've made a lot of tarts and this was a great easy receipe and the results looked very pro, tasted fantastic!....I made with homegrown lemons and will make again, probably within a week with the rest of my homegrown fruit-or store-bought as this was such an outstanding success.

I haven't even tasted this yet, but it's taken twice as long as the recipe called for. The dough wouldn't go into the dish --- putting it in the freezer helps, as with all pie-like doughs. And the filling is taking much longer than expected to set. Disappointed.
**EDIT**
So, we tried it. So, so, so, sweet. If I made this again, I would not include any sugar in the dough and cut the sugar in the filling in half. Even drizzling the tart with fresh lemon juice doesn't seem to offset it. Eek.

Crust was difficult to work with.
