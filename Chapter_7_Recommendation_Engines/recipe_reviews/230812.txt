Roast beef is my go-to Thanksgiving dinner, as I don't like turkey.  I was looking to do something a little different when I came across this recipe.  Usually I read through reviews before I'll try something, especially when it's for a big family dinner.  I decided to take the risk with this one.  ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  We used a top sirloin roast instead of a standing rib, but followed things pretty closely otherwise.  The meat was tender, juicy, and very flavourful.  The gravy I made with the drippings was amazing.  We loved it so much that we will be making it again later this week when we have different dinner guests.

Fantastic recipe - whenever I tell people I brine a rib roast they think I'm crazy. Until they try this. I usually just leave off the French Onion soup and sub Beef Broth.

I don't ever venture making a recipe with only 4 reviews,  however I felt strongly that this was going to be a good one and it wasn't complicated.  I followed the recipe exactly and hoped for the best seeing it was for a Christmas Day dinner. I was not disappointed. It was delicious and got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper.

Made exactly as written and flavor is outstanding! The only change I made was to cooking time. I found a fool-proof method that cooks it to a perfect medium rare center every time. Pre-heat oven to 500 degrees. Roast in oven at this temp for 5 minutes per pound, then turn oven off, do not open at all for two hours. No need to let it stand before carving when you take it out because it’s already stood the last bit to return juices to the center.

I made this for a 50th Birthday Party and it was absolutely delicious. I have to say that I was concerned about brining such an excellent cut of meat in coffee but decided I would give it a try and I'm so glad I did. I followed the directions to a "T" and the roast came out PERFECT - medium rare, so juicy, melt in your mouth tender and so flavorful. (There was no hint of coffee in the cooked meat so don't be concerned about brining the meat in coffee). Our guests loved it and raved about it all through dinner and two friends asked me for the recipe so they could make it for two of their upcoming events. This recipe has been added to my "favorites" and will now be my "go to" recipe when planning a decadent, elaborate, fancy meal.

Five star reviews always get my attention and I was intrigued seeing brewed coffee as one of the ingredients.  I halved the recipe because my roast was only 3 to 4 lbs.
I marinated it overnight and cooked it in a 375 oven until it registered medium well on the meat thermometer.  I did not have time or patience to cook it per instructions provided, ie, turning the oven off for a period of time and then turning it  back on to finish cooking the meat. I let it rest for about 20 minutes before carving and omg, what a tender, flavourful roast!  I'll definitely be keeping this marinade for future!!!

Amazing recipe! 
Only thing I had to do is add 2c of water to,pan during last portion of cooking! 
Everyone raved about it and gravy was outstanding!!
Also, had to cook longer..important to have meat thermometer!

This is the first prime rib roast that I have ever made. I decided to try it for Christmas and it turned out amazing. It was juicy and well seasoned. It was just as good as the beef in the major steak houses.

Didn’t get to marinate as long as suggested but turned out great. My wife is not a big roast eater and she enjoyed it.

First time brining anything, and did a side-by-side with a typical roast that I would make before. 

This recipe absolutely blew my family and me away. I'll be experimenting with this base recipe for years to come!

It was certainly tasty but too salty. “ If” I were to make it again I would cut the salt to 3/4 c.  and only use 1/2 of the dry onion soup mix and just use some plain dried onion.

We made for Christmas dinner (as described) and it was outstanding.  No residual coffee flavor - the meat was tender and juicy and delicious.  I was intrigued by the recipe since every review was a 5-star and am so glad we tried it! Highly recommend this recipe!

This was excellent, and will be the only recipe I use  from now on!  I was apprehensive with the amount of minced garlic called for but the seasoning is perfect.  Not having any French Roast coffee on hand I used strong brewed medium roast coffee and it was superb; better than most restaurant prime rib I've eaten!  Thank you for sharing this melt in your mouth recipe!!

I used this recipe for an 8 lb prime rib roast...it turned out pretty awesome, but we did need to cook it quite a bit longer at the end.  Not sure if it was because it was prime rib (no bones) instead of standing rib.  The taste was amazing!

Having never made prime rib or rib roast, I followed the recipe exactly. I made a gravy out of a combo of the drippings and a bit of the brine, which was amazing on the beef and accompanying potatoes. This is my new holiday specialty!

Used the brine recipe on a smaller and different cut roast so I had to adjust the cooking method. Was very good. Also, I subbed just a heaping spoon of onion powder for the soup, since it's something I don't buy.
