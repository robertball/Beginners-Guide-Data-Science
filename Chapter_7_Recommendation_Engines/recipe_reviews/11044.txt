I made this doday and it was amazing! I was amking it for a wedding shower so I made it on a cookie sheet and cut it into small triangles. I topped it with mini m&m's, chopped pecans (halves would have been too big), butterscotch chips, peanutbutter chips and the melted white chocolate. looked great and eventhough I cut the bars pretty tiny, they were really rich. A little tip: It's less messy to cut if it's chilled for a while in the fridge.

This is coming from the kids, not me. They had a blast throwing all kinds of goodies on top. Peanut butter and butter scotch chips, mini marshmallows, etc. They even put it back in the oven for a minute to get it a little more melty. Coming from a LONG-TERM girl scout leader, this is a great little scout baking project. Easy badge! Thanks Robin!

What a wonderful cookie! My kids love it and the cookie itself (even without the 'pizza' topping) tastes delicious. I just use whatever 'topping' I have available.

This was really rich (have lots of milk handy) 
...but yummy! I think I might have overcooked it a bit, because some of the cookie (on the ouside) was crunchy, so watch the cooking time. My little guy really liked it, but then he gets his sweet tooth from his mother...

This 'pizza' is delicious! I always add chocolate chips to the cookie batter. I also add more milk to the frosting so that it is less glossy and more creamy. That makes it much easier to spread. I also skip the coconut.

This cookie was FABULOUS ! We made it for Valentine's Day...shaped it like a heart, put chocolate chips in the crust and topped with mini M&Ms, conversation hearts and red sprinkles. Loved the chocolate frosting. Was quick and simple ! Love it

This was sooo good!!  I was having a friend over for pizza and a movie and thought this would be great to serve as a fun dessert.  We had a great time decorating it with all of our favorite candies (we used m&ms and white chocolate chips...not the other things mentioned on the recipe).  I was worried it was going to be too sweet after tasting the frosting but it was just rich and chocolaty and delicious.  It was even better the next day after sitting in the fridge overnight.

What a fun recipe to make... I added choc chips and just alittle salt (about 1/4 teas) to the batter to make it a choc chip cookie pizza. I've never made this before and was nervous about it cooking all the way through but the cookie baked perfectly. The frosting came out great and was easy to make and the kids LOVED putting the toppings on the "pizza". We added M&Ms, Heath Bar pieces, Rollos (cut into quarters), peanut butter chips and the melted white choc to the top. Not only did it look amazing but it tasted Amazing! I have a HUGE sweet tooth and loved this and I thought the frosting went great w/ this cookie... 2 of the 5 kids said it was alittle too sweet but they still ate it and one even went back for seconds. My nephew said to me, "Auntie, you are a genius for making this!" LOL You can't beat a compliment like that. I'm DEFINATLY adding this to my recipe book! And next time I'm letting the kids add their own toppings to "their" half. THANKS!!!

I made this recipe with mini-m&m's in the cookie dough for a cookie-pizza for my 5 year old's birthday. I didn't do any of the toppings, just added a few extra mini-m&m's on top to make it look pretty. It turned out just like a large cookie. Very good  :)  I do have a tip- be careful when baking it- it is very easy to over bake it and have your edges get too brown.

Delicious! Made it for my students three times now. To make it even easier (because it is so simple to prepare), I use store-bought frosting. Really, really wonderful!

I goofed and bought a 14.75" pizza pan instead of the 12" recommended in the recipe.  Therefore my first try was a mess.  However I figured out the trick the second time--double the cookie recipe and bake for 20-25 minutes.  Make 1 1/2 times the frosting recipe and you get a nice thick layer of chocolate.  Being a peanut butter lover, I topped with Reece’s pieces.  Yum!

This was a great recipe! I followed everything but the toppings to a T. Instead of the coconut flakes, chocolate candies, and pecans, I did chopped up KitKat and Snickers pieces. Because there was so much chocolate, I also left out the white chocolate drizzle. But the base and "sauce" was very good. However, I would suggest baking the cookie for a little less time (maybe 12-13 minutes), as it wasn't very chewy at all and a little too dark on the edges, and DEFINITELY grease the sheet. I greased it just a little and the cookie still stuck to the pizza pan horribly. Also, I ended up needing quite a bit of hot water to make the sauce more glossy, probably about 3 tablespoons worth. Otherwise, yummmmmmy!

The kids had so much fun making this. And they loved it. I used white chocolate chips for the icing instead of choc. and colored the coconut. For toppings we used m&m's, pb chips, choc chips, coconut, marshmallows, butterscotch chips, and pecans. The kids loved it! Thanks!

I knew my kids would like this but the real test was my husband and mother.  They loved it too!  Other pizza type desserts have a 'weak' tasting cookie crust.  Not this crust!  It was so tasty and perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe made me the Hero of the Scout Year-End party! I didn't use any nuts but added Skor toffee bits instead.  It looked great and tasted even better!  And, it travelled well, since we were at an out of town picnic.

kids loved it.  I would make it for a kids party but instead of a patch of cookies would not be a great idea because it does not last very long.

Superb recipe however the white chocolate did not melt properly so I just put them on the pizza strait out of the bag
