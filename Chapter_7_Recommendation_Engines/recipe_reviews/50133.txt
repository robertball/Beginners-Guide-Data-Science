All I have to say is GOOD STUFF.  I am not a coffee drinker and anything there is to take away from that coffee taste and still give me that morning energy I love.  Thanks.

Oh boy, what's not to like? Absolutely delish and so comforting on a cold N.J. night. Thanks "gang" and Josie too for the info!

Very yummy! I don't really think you need the 2 tsps of sugar though, the coffee mate is sweet enough on it's own. I drink the Hazelnut coffee mate in my coffee every morning, but I hadn't thought of adding some cinnamon, and I really like that addition.

Absolutely delicious!  I love hazelnut and cinnamon and they are great paired together in coffee.  This is also good made with the French Vanilla creamer.  Thanks Nestle.
