This was a hit at home and at work!  I added 3 T of oil because I was worried it wouldn't be moist enough, it came out lovely.  Made 18 cupcakes!  Used Caramel Frosting I also from this site.  Prepared the frosting and dipped the tops of the cupcakes into it.  The flavors were excellent together.  My 4 year-old says they are his favorite cupcake and he wants them for his upcoming Birthday.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I was all set to make this and looked through my cupboards and found out I didn't have apple pie filling. So, I made my own. (In small saucepan, I used 1 1/4 c. water, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, 2 tbsp. cornstarch, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. allspice and cooked it until thickened, then added three large cored, peeled and chopped Granny Smith apples.) Other than that, I made no changes. Smells wonderful. I'll update my review once my family's been able to try it. It really wasn't all that difficult to throw together as a quick dessert, even with making my own substitute apple pie filling. EDITED: I don't think the cream cheese type of frosting is the right frosting for this cake. It tastes off to me. It might be better with a brown sugar frosting or even a vanilla glaze. If I make this again, I'll try that. The cake and frosting are good on their own but would be better paired with different recipes. EDITED SEVERAL DAYS LATER: Noone ate this. Sorry.

Yes this cake is incredibly easy to make, but it tastes like it is from a box/can. Unless you are willing to do some major doctoring (perhaps add 4-6 bananas and a packet of vanilla pudding) it isn't worth it. I only made it because I wanted to get rid of my can of apple pie filling. Also, to get the cake to look like the picture you will need a ton of icing as this recipe as is produces large dimples in the cake. The icing recipe is worth saving and also works great with pumpkin butter, but dont waste your time on the cake.

I made the recipe as-is with no modifications.  It was fast and easy to get into the oven.    It was so moist and had such a great flavor.  I baked it in 2 - 8in round pans.  But I will make it in the 9X13 next time.  My family gobbled it up!!The entire cake is gone after 1 day!  I have never seen a cake get eaten so fast!  AWESOME!

Very good! And tasty for a fall dessert. However, I don't really approve of the icing. It came out much runnier than expected, even after adding more confectionar sugar; I'd recommend using a different icing. But, other wise, good.

I used this icing on a made from scratch spice cake and it was a perfect addition. I felt it needed more apple butter after my first attempt. I doubled the quantity and added a little cinnamon. Perfect. I'll definitely be pulling this recipe out again in the fall.
