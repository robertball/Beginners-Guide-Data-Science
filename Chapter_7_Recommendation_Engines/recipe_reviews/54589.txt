I made this for a large event and got tons and tons of raves!  The crackers tasted just like  cheeze-its to me and  to the other event participants. I used yellow mustard instea dof mustard pwd and added it after cutting in the butter and i used a very sharp cheddar and a good 1/2 cup more per batch than called for. I was able to process the dough in my food processor. After chilling i rolled it out and cut it into shapes with cookie cutters and baked as directed. I also used "paste" food coloring to color the dough for a presentation piece and it worked very well.

I really like this recipe.  I adjusted it to be gluten-free, using one cup white rice flour, and one cup garfava flour in place of the all-purpose flour (plus 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum).  I also followed the suggestion to replace the white pepper with cayenne, since I wanted them to taste like Cheez-Its.  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup, and I used 1 cup of cheese, not 1/2 cup, as many others had suggested.  I think the crackers would have been even cheesier if I'd have used sharp cheddar, but I bought mild cheddar by mistake.
The recipe worked really well, only I had to bake them much longer to get them done enough, but that could very well be because of the different flours I used.
I will be making these again!

I was looking for a cracker recipe to replace expensive commercially-made crackers.  These did not taste like crackers at all, in fact they tasted exactly like pie crust-- so I checked my copy of Rose Levy Beranbaum's book, "The Pie and Pastry Bible" and sure enough I found that her recipe for "Flaky Cheddar Pie Crust" is almost IDENTICAL to this recipe.   I will make this again as a pie crust for a savory pie, but not as crackers.  It was also not very cheesy tasting, even though I doubled amount of cheese the recipe called for AND added in some grated romano cheese.  I also salted them lightly with regular table salt before baking.

These taste just like Cheezits. I even used all whole wheat flour. I did as others suggested and doubled the cheese. As with any recipe that calls for cutting in butter you have to take your time and make sure the butter stays cold during this step by putting the mixture back in the fridge if the butter starts to soften too much while cutting it in. This way the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dough. I am really excited because now I can use a small cookie cutter and have any shape cheezit I want! I love to have lots of pretty appitizers. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I agree with the other reviews in this being more suited as a pie crust recipe.  I was looking for a recipe similar to one I used to make as a kid - it contained much less butter which made the crackers quite dense and smooth.  I will have to keep looking.

These are good with parmesan and american cheese instead of cheddar and tomorrow I'm going to try a batch with mozzarella.  When Hurricane Irene was about to hit I had over half a pound of American cheese in the fridge.  I made 4 half batches, each with different seasonings, and was able to eat them and avoid throwing out the cheese even though my power went off for 22 hours (and I was lucky at that).  Try cayenne with paprika, onion powder or curry powder.

Those of you who double the cheese, you are right.  It's better.  I'm going to try and cut the butter like somebody here posted.

Another flavoring tip: mix 1/4 tsp each garlic powder (not salt), onion powder (not salt), paprika, cayenne, oregano, black pepper and thyme.  Nice little bite on the tongue.

i forgot to add the cheese but they still tasted great.  without the cheese i needed to add several more tablespoons of water. the taste was a combo between pie crust and saltines; interesting, but good!

I followed the other reviewers suggestions by cutting the butter to 1/2 cup and doubling the cheese. I used whole wheat flour too, and my allergic-to-health-food husband and picky son didn't notice. They turned out fantastic! Really addictive, and taste so much like cheese-its! The thinner they're rolled the crispier and better they are.
Update: so many people complained this was too much like a pie crust, so I decided to utilize that idea. However, I made a pot pie and had a lot of trouble getting this dough to become crispy as a crust should. It was tasty, but I will stick to using this for crackers.

I too used GF flour mix and only gave this four stars because it would make an excellent Cheddar Pie Crust for say--a chicken pot pie. Other wise, this was not a good cracker for me, too wet in the center and dry.

As a pie crust, I give this a 5 plus! It's peppery, cheesy flavor would be great for a quiche. As a cracker...no.  There is nothing 'crackery' about this unless you like eating left over baked pie crust.  However, and if you do like pie crust than role it out translucent thin to get that cracker type texture (although it will stay taste like a really thin pie crust).

I agree that these turned out more like pastry bites vs a cracker. but seriously good on flavor. I used the red tubbed sharp cheese and added smoked paprika. coupled these with creamy black bean dip and heaven was close.

The crackers are very easy to make and are light.  They are not as cheesy as I would like, but I tweek it a little more each time.  This last time I used my silicone mat and saved a lot of time.  My crackers were on my mat from rolling out until I placed them in a container.  Since they do not spread, I waited until cooled to break up.

It was a really easy recipe to follow and the resulting crackers were delicious. I had never made crackers before so I was a little nervous, but my friends and family loved them! I rolled the dough out and cut it into shapes with a cookie cutter, it worked well and the crackers held their shape in baking. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent basic cheese cracker, very easily made with pie crust technique for food processor.  I made them with 1/2 whole wheat and used almost twice the cheese and got an excellent result.  Just add sliced chilled butter to the dry ingredients and pulse less than you imagine - maybe 10 short one second bursts.  Dough looks like wet sand. then add about 1/2 the water called for with motor running - quickly - and turn off. Pulse the cheese in, let it rest and roll it out. Make it REALLY thin and watch carefully.  rolling with parchment on top and bottom worked very well.  Toss back in frige if it gets sticky.

These were better than I thought they'd be! I was looking for a different taste, so I spiced mine with only garlic salt and kept true to the 1/2 cup cheddar, fearing they'd be flavorless. They certainly weren't. I like cheese, but not much of it at once, so these were perfect. They're just between crunchy and chewy, which was a slight disappointment at first but they've definitely grown on me as I can't stop eating them (and they're much better after cooling). The only con I have is that they're packed with fat, obviously due to the butter. I wonder how they'd come out with low-fat/unsalted.

Fantastic recipe!  Great base recipe that we can do so much with to get variety :)  I did not have cheddar cheese so I used 1 C of shredded parmesan instead.  Wonderful flavor!  Can't wait to try this recipe w/ Cheddar as well as Pepper Jack for a little kick!  Thank you so much for sharing and thanks to all the people who left helpful reviews!

Easy to make...seasoning required adjusting to taste.  Made it with sharp cheddar cheese and another batch with hot pepper blend cheese.  Be sure to roll out to thickness as stated in the recipe.  Definitely will make these again.

Pretty dissapointed. Tasted like pie crust to me too, not at all like crackers and I couldn't taste the cheese even though I put 1 cup in. I will definately be trying a different recipe instead.

Loved these.  Turned out a bit thick, like a pastry, which I was fine with.  A bit of cayenne also gave it a nice new dimension.

I never imagined I'd be baking up my own crackers, but here I am! I added some garlic powder and oregano and doubled the amount of salt. I also used parmesan in addition to the suggested cheese.After cutting them in strips, I scored them with a butter knife and they broke apart perfectly after they were baked. Can't wait to try these again!

In all fairness to the author, I did alter the recipe. What I made I would give 2 stars. I'm bumping it up a star because I altered it and I'm giving the author the benefit of the doubt. 

Several people said these taste like cheesy pie crust. They're right. Now, I do think how long you cook them (and what your altitude is) may affect how crispy they turn out, but this is what I did and how they turned out:

I did 1/2 cup of butter, as reviewers suggested, and 1 cup of shredded sharp cheese. (I also added different seasonings, but that will not affect consistency.) I did not space the crackers and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. 20 minutes was my mistake--I guess I misread the recipe--but being that I baked them for that long, I simply cannot imagine baking them for a shorter period of time. The crackers right around the outside edge were crunchier, but the middle ones were a bit like a baked pie crust, in all honesty. Also these were GREASY!!! I can't imagine adding more butter! There's a point when baking where I think there's just TOO much butter--like it's all you taste. For me, even cutting the butter down there was WAY too much butter. They're interesting little chewy crackers, and my boyfriend likes them, but they are not at all like a Cheeze-It, and I am quite puzzled as to how some reviewers seem to think they're identical. They're not at all.

These do really taste like Cheezits! I followed the recipe, but ended up needing about double the tbls of water it called for and I doubled the cheese per other reviews. I also had to cook them about 10 extra minutes to get nice and crispy. My kids love them!!

Would definitely make again. 
Added 1/2 cup more cheese.
Substituted cayenne for mustard powder.
Added 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning.
BAKE UNTIL DRY! They continue to crisp after baking.

Awesome as is. My boys and husband ate them like they were going out of style. Also it makes a good base recipe. You can omit the seasonings and replace them with any that you want

I made these crackers with a few modification: 1. I used whole wheat flour  2. I used margarine 3. I doubled the mustard and left out the pepper.  4. I baked them for an extra ten minutes.   These crackers were really good, but they did not have a strong cheese flavor.

I stayed fairly true this recipe the first couple of times I made it. I now change it up with different herbs.

Nice biscuit, mine came out too doughy maybe I need to roll it thinner. Added more cheese and some baking soda to second batch.
