Marinated for 10 hours in the fridge inside of a gallon zippie bag.  I used sesame seeds - no oil at all.  I didn't grill, but instead baked covered at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or until fork flaky and cooked all the way through. I did use the marinade for a reduction sauce (served under the salmon on the plate). I placed the marinade in a sauce pan for about 15 minutes, adding a bit of white wine to enhance the flavor.  A huge hit with the entire family!!

I used this recipe without the sesame oil or peanut oil. BEST salmon I've ever made. I will use again for sure.

Wonderful marinade - like one of the other reviewers, I didn't have time to let it marinade more than an hour.  And I cooked the salmon in a skillet, reducing the remainder of the marinade into a glaze with a 1/4 cup white wine.  Yummy, and definitely a great way to use up the last green onions and fresh ginger.  I served with a florentine risotto and steamed broccoli.

This salmon WAS slammin'. I used fresh ginger because I like it more and I had some, used an extra clove of garlic, left out the salt, and cut way back (down to 2T) on the peanut oil since I was baking instead of grilling. Thanks for the recipe, we'll be having this again.

Very nice!  After reading other reviews, I didn't bother with the peanut oil, but did use the sesame oil for the flavor.  As always, I used low sodium tamari soy sauce.  Marinated only two hours, my wild Alaskan salmon was very flavorful and moist.  I served this with garlic red potatoes from this site and it was a wonderful combo.

Delish! I cooked the salmon with all the marinade in a large cast iron skillet instead of grilling and it sort of made a glaze. It was so yummy! I can't think of a meat this wouldn't be good on. My family and I were discussing it and we're going to try using it as the sauce for a shrimp stir fry!

OMG! this is soooooo good!!! I could literally drink the marinade, it's that good. :) Since I was only serving my hubs and myself, I purchased two salmon filets. My butcher gave me 8 oz. filets instead of the 4 oz. ones I asked for, but I'm certainly not complaining! I made enough marinade for four filets, poured half over my salmon and reserved the rest to drizzle over some exotic mixed greens. A former co-worker I sometimes see on my daily commute to work told me about this recipe and how delicious the marinade was. She suggested serving it as a dressing, hence the idea. Try it! Served with potatoes in chili butter (Green Giant brand, located in your grocer's produce section), this was one seriously SLAMMIN' meal. My hubs and I don't generally share the same culinary point of view, but we couldn't agree more when it comes to this meal - it's light, healthy, delicious and 100% worthy of a repeat at our house (and a permanent spot in our menu rotation). Thanks for sharing, Aytom! :-)

I love salmon, but I was expecting a lot more flavor in the marinade...especially from the ginger and balsamic...I couldn't really taste them in the final product. Still, it was good and I think next time, I'll set aside some of the marinade and reduce it to make a sauce for the finished fish.

EVERYONE in my family LOVED this!  (Yes, even my 6-y-o and my 2-y-o)  My DH subbed 1/4 tsp. peanut butter and 1/2 c. olive oil instead of the peanut oil. (We like the peanutty taste, but we only keep olive oil and coconut oil on hand).  Everything else was exactly as written.  This is our go-to salmon recipe.

I took another reviewers suggestion and did not use any oil and it didn't need it.  I didn't have any time to marinate so I put it in a pan with aluminum foil in the oven and it came out perfect!

Epic! Add yet one more voice to the Greek chorus praising this recipe. It's easy to tailor this to your taste. We're not people who like things real hot, so in place of the crushed red pepper flakes, I used about 1/4 tsp cayenne. Also didn't have green onions, but I did have one very lovely leek, so I chopped up the light green part. No peanut oil, so I subbed extra virgin olive oil. I also finely grated the zest of one lemon into the marinade. These changes presented no problem. It was INCREDIBLE. In place of salmon, I had some 2" thick marlin fillets. We grilled it over charcoal, and I'm telling you, this was darned near nirvana! Moist, full of smoky, earthy, delectable taste. Salmon is coming next. But be aware that it translates perfectly into other firm-meated fish, such as ahi (fresh tuna,) shark, mahi-mahi, or swordfish. Beg, borrow, or steal the ingredients to make this one. Yes, it IS that good!

We loved it! Be sure to marinade the night before. I'll also set more aside for a drizzle as I serve.  We grilled ours on a cedar plank and loved it!  I substituted olive oil for the peanut oil because I didn't have peanut oil on the shelf.  The 2nd time we made this, I made 4 individual servings of this for my grandma: I just put a little marinade in a baggie with 4 oz salmon and froze it in the 4 separate bags.  She kept them in her freezer, thawed before cooking, and cooked them on her little George Forman grill.  She said they were delicious and she wants the recipe.  I'm going to keep her supplied in Slammin' Salmon for all she's done for me and my family for 80+ years! This would be a great freeze ahead meal and awesome for people who need meals delivered.

SUPERB!  I think out of 5 stars, I would give it 10 if I could!  My apartment complex does not allow grills, so I broiled this, and it was out of this world!  I blog on Facebook what I make and I am sure that I will get lots of requests regarding this recipe, as I RAVED about it!  I can't wait to have guests over and make this for them.  I make a delicious Garlic Dill Salmon, and NEVER thought I would find something comparable!  This recipe rocks!  And I love the Asian flavor!  It was incredible!  I let mine marinade overnight, and didn't cook it until late in the evening the next day.  It was so flavorful and delicious!  My cat was practically in my lap when I was having dinner!  She's usally pretty good, but this was something she wanted as well.  I had a huge piece of salmon and no other company so I shared with her a SMALL piece, and she didn't leave it!  I am so happy to have found this recipe!  It was incredible, delicious and actually quite simple.  I specifically went and bought balsamic vinegar JUST for this recipe and I am so happy that I did!  I have another huge piece of Salmon and I will make this one again VERY VERY VERY soon!  Thank you so much!

This was quick, easy & very flavourful. I did not use the 1/2 cup of oil (to reduce to reduce the calories), and it was fine. I baked the salmon in the marinade at 350 for 15 min.

To make the topping a little more substantial, I added some sliced mushrooms. Sauté them first in a bit of olive oil, garlic, green onions and a bit of salt/seasonings - not from the quantities of the original recipe - and drain the liquid before adding the mushrooms to the salmon as a topping.

I choose this recipe for a last minute party at my house. I was nervous because I had never cooked salmon before and I didn't have time to marinate. I made the marinade, replacing sesame & peanut oil with olive oil. I poured it over the salmon fillets in a tinfoil pouch and placed it on the grill. I did not turn the fillets during cooking. It was the best salmon I had ever had. My guests raved, comparing it to an orchestra of flavors. Thanks for sharing!!!

Had this on wild sockeye salmon. Marinated about an hour and then grilled, followed recipe as written except for powdered ginger as i was out. Wouldn't change a thing.

Beautiful flavor!!  Love and will use this recipe over and over again! I marinated salmon only 2 hours, but will marinate longer the next time for even more flavor!  I loosely wrapped 2 lbs. salmon, skin side down, in foil, and placed on a cookie sheet and baked for 30 minutes.  Baked sweet potato topped with butter and brown sugar was a perfect side for this salmon!

I am giving this 4 stars because the flavor was very good, however, it had too much heat for my taste.  I would tweak it next time using less ginger and probably no red pepper flakes.

Mediocre. I cook salmon all the time and wanted to try a new recipe. This was disappointing at best. It's not awful but somehow it makes it more "fishy" tasting and not in a good way. None of the salmon flavour comes through.

Awesome Salmon recipe!  I used fresh ginger because I didn't have any ground ginger.  I BBQ'd it to 145 degrees on some aluminum foil and basted it with some of the juice every 10 minutes.  I would compare this to some of the best fish you could get at a restaurant!

This is an excellent salmon recipe! Easy to make and out of this world flavor! I make this per the recipe and let the salmon marinate for about two hours. This provided great flavor for the salmon without overpowering it. The only variation I made was to leave the skin on the salmon fillets. I find that this works better on the grill. I'll definately be making this again!

I made this last night and it was really good.  A nice change of pace with great flavor.  I followed the recipe for the most part except upped the amount of red pepper since we like things with a kick.  I also used about a quarter cup of sesame oil instead of the peanut oil.  We just like the flavor of the sesame oil much better.  I also didn't add all the green onions to the marinade and saved some to sprinkle on top of the salmon fillets when they came off the grill.  This was incredibly tasty and I will definitely make it again.  I marinated the fillets for about 6 hours but next time might try the full 24 hours.

This is a fabulous marinade. I marinated the salmon for 24 hours and then BBQ'd it. It was tender and juicy and the spices didn't over power the fish. Make this one! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is a great marinade! The flavors are intense and well-balanced. I would use it for poultry as well.

This is my number one BBQ recipe for fish in the summer. Everyone raves about it and it is foolproof If I can do it, anyone can make it and look like an amazing chef. Highly recommended for guest cooking. Excellent!

We really liked this alot even though my husband over cooked it. So if cooked a little less it would be awesome. I don't like salmon normally so to have some that i can actually eat the whole thing without gagging is a feat in itself but to make one that i actually want more at the end is a marvel. Thanks so much

Call Guinness, I almost followed the recipe to a T.  Did omit the salt and peanut oil.  Served with mixed veggies with dried cranberries and Spinach Salad with Pepper Jelly Dressing.

Salmon was alright, but not the best as far as spices. I had to add other spices to enhance the flavor of salmon a bit.

Wow. Tried this for the first time last night and it tasted great! I was pressed for time and only marinated the salmon for 30 mins. I would baste the salmon while grilling to prevent dryness. I also left out the peanut oil and green onions but it still tasted good. Best marinade ever! Thanks for sharing!

just okay. would probably use the recipie as a base for another marinade, but would not bother making exactly as described again.  I let marinate for 24 hours, and flavor was good - just not, out of this world.

I only marinated for about a half hour and I baked it in the oven instead of grilling but it was still really good!  Great salmon recipe - even my DH who doesn't really like salmon liked this recipe.

OMG! This is delicious!!! I don't know why anyone wouldn't give this 5 stars, this recipe deserves 5 stars. I don't rate recipes often, but this is so good I have to. My husband isn't impressed easily, but upon first taste he wished we had made more of this salmon. We used Coho Salmon and marinated it for about 3 hours. We plan to make this again this week! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Haha, ok, this dish was awesome, even though it was a disaster cooking it! I spilled the marinade and had to redo it, and then didn't actually taste this dish, because I had a slight cold when I madeit! But my fiance and his kids loved this so much I HAD to rate it five stars. I omitted the pepper flakes (kids not into spicy food) ad the green onions (didn't have any) other than that I followed the recipe as written. They raved and raved, asked for seconds, and my fiance said it was one of the best ways I cooked salmon. Again, I can't vouch for the flavor's because my nose was stopped up, all I could really taste was lemon and a little brown sugar. My fiance said that the lemon was strong, but not in a bad way. So if you're not into lemon, maybe that would be a good thing to omit.
They always say to marinate the salmon no more than 30 minutes but I think it depends...I marinated mine for several hours and my fiance said the flavor went through every bite...and that it was delicious!

Excellent.   I made a couple of changes---skipped the salt because my soy sauce was quite salty.   Also, I skipped the red peppers because my family isn't a big fan of too much 'heat'.   The salmon got rave reviews from everyone at the table.   I'll definitely make this again!

I don't like salmon, but this was not terrible, as salmon goes. I used fresh sockeye salmon fillets, which probably helped. We cooked this on a cedar plank, but I think I'd have liked it better directly on the grate. To me the best parts were the edges, where it got overcooked, and tasted/textured more like chicken than fish. Husband ate most of my portion and all of his too, thanks for the recipe!

I had a three pound slab of salmon and still had a ton of marinade. I cooked the rest of the marinade over the stove top and added some cornstarch to thicken it up some, but it still tasted a bit to sour and I felt it needed a bit more sweet taste, so added about a few tablespoons of clover honey and that did the trick. We did grill the salmon on the gas grill and spooned more of the sweeter marinade over while cooking...and then it was slammin!

I was going to give this 3 stars.  I decreased the oil to half and only marinated the salmon for about 1 hour because I didn't have time (I've read someone wrote that we should not marinate salmon more than 20 minutes or so).  It wasn't too bad but it was too sour to me.  Then, I had the left over for lunch next day and it was much better.  The taste blended nicely and I enjoyed it much better than the night before.  It wasn't "slamming" but I would make it again and I'll make sure to marinate it over night next time.

I made this like the recipe said and it came out bland. I had to bake it instead of grilling it and I think that might have been the reason. The marinade by itself smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to try. I let the salmon and marinade sit for 8 hours but for some reason the flavors didn't stick. I might give this another try over the summer and see if grilling makes a difference.

Great salmon recipe.  Grill is best, but in the oven at 375 for 20 min or so is also rewarding.

Growing up on the shores of Lake Michagan I have eaten a lot of salmon and always looking for something new.  This is it and it is awesome.  I didn't change a thing and served it to my parents and they asked for the recipe too!  Thanks for sharing!

I prepared this for dinner last night. I have to admit I liked the smell of the marinade better than eating the final product. Don't get me wrong-- it is tasty, but my family members (7 of us) and I all agreed it was a bit too powerful a combination of tastes.. probably needs less of some of the stronger tastes like balsamic.. and maybe more of the mellower flavors like brown sugar. Personally, while a recipe like this is intriguing for salmon, it's a better fish served with less seasoning, so that the true, delicious salmon flavor doesn't get lost.

Did not change a thing . . . the salmon filets were marinading for 5 hours.  I was afraid that the acid would cook the fish but it didn't.  The marinade added a nice mild flavor that didn't over power the fish.  It could have sat in the marinade a lot longer without compromising the texture.  Good job!

this really is as tasty as everyone says!  Substituted Canola for the Peanut oil ('cuz I didn't have peanut), and baked for 20 minutes at 425.  The only things is that (not surprisingly) it  turned out a very dark color....soy, balsamic, etc.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  We have tried many recipes for salmon from this site, and this is my favorite!  It is sweet, salty and sour all at the same time!  Easy and fantastic!!!!!

Delish! My husband made this yummy fish dish - He left out the peanut and sesame oils - he substituted 1 tsp olive oil for the sesame. The smell of the merinate was wonderful ( we are going to try it with other things )and the aroma from the grill was really nice! A recipe we will use over and over!

This was so delicious! I used olive oil instead of peanut. I did not marinate for very long but it still turned out perfect.

This is a staple in my home. Every time we have new guests over for dinner, this is what I make. In colder months I simply bake it, as others have stated. I serve it over a bed of leafy greens, on top of some angel hair. It's SO GOOD!!!

Incredible salmon - I followed the recipe spices specifically but changed out the peanut oil to olive oil and skilled the sesame oil, and it was still delicious.  I may try 1 tablespoon of peanut butter next time to give it that peanut butter flare, as mentioned in a previous review. I also marinated it for 30 minutes. I baked mine at 400 degrees for 25 minutes (was thick salmon) with skin down, and drizzled the remaining marinade on top. It's the best I've ever had and will make this for years to come.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :)

This "Slammin' Salmon" was delicious, although the fact that I loved it is a reflection of the fact that I love even plain salmon. Nonetheless, this recipe provided a delicious gourmet marinade. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I myself had the bad idea to cook the marinade and serve it on top of broccoli: it was horrible and went straight into the garbage. So...I conclude...this is a marinade and not a dipping sauce. Thank you Aytom for sharing your recipe.

For the life of me could not find any balsamic vinegar so I improvised and used balsamic salad dressing that contained olive oil(omitted the oil in recipie). Marinated the salmon overnight baked in the oven. This turned out really nice will for sure make again.  -CALGARYSASSYCAROL

Phenomenal!!! Great flavor! I used much much less oil than the recipe called for to limit the fat. I also broiled as there is a foot of snow on the ground- can't get to the grill. Delicious! My husband doesn't like salmon and loved this!

Sorry this wasn't for me.  I did not have peanut oil so use a little canola oil.  The flavors were bland and too pungent. I will keep looking for a good salmon recipe.

AMAZING!!! Added extra red pepper (we love the heat) and a bit of extra brown sugar.  We cut back on the lemon juice and didn't use any peanut oil.  This was absolutely FANTASTIC.  We doubled the recipe and cooked the extra marinade on the stovetop to thicken it up to pour it over the finished product.  This recipe has been forwarded ti everyone we know and I can't wait to have it again!  We actually contemplated re-making it a second night in a row just to have some more.

Wasn't crazy about this recipe; however, we baked the fish instead of grilling - and I think that the grill would have given this recipe an added dimension that would have complimented the flavors better than baking. I thought there was a lot going on flavor wise - maybe a little too much for my preference. The kids weren't that crazy about it either, but my husband did enjoy it. If I try this recipe again I will reduce some of the seasonings and definitely grill it.

This was exxxxxcellent. I make salmon very often, but husband said this was the best salmon I've ever made. I needed to come up with dinner quickly and didn't have time to marinate it at all - I simply threw all the ingredients on the salmon and baked it for about 15 minutes. Next time I will plan ahead and marinate.

Wow.  This is the only way my husband likes to eat salmon.  It's smokey and tangy: the flavors of the sesame oil and soy sauce really tame the 'fishy' flavors of the salmon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

For all the ingredients that are in this marinade, it was surprisingly bland and lacked flavor. I followed exactly except omitted green onions.  Maybe all the flavors cancelled each other out, but it in no way complemented the fresh, wild salmon that's now in season. You'd be better off with a soy/brown sugar/worcestershire marinade and leave all the other stuff out.  It wasn't terrible, but I won't be making again.

didn't have ginger and didn't notice it missing in this recipe but will add it next time to try.  There will definitely be a next time.  This was an awesome, moist, flavorful fish.  I rolled the salmon in sesame seeds around the edges before grilling, added a nice flavor and texture.  served over jasmine rice with a little extra soy and green onions added.  yummy!

The whole family loved it! I left out the paprika, the peanut oil, and mistakenly substituted cumin for the ginger, and it was still great.  We like cumin more than ginger anyway so it worked for us. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Thanks.

This was delicious.  It marinated between 3-4 hours, and it took just a few minutes on the grill.  Flavor was subtle/mild but went well with the natural taste of salmon.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I give this recipe 4 instead of 5 stars because I didn't love it until I added lime juice on top of my cooked salmon. I actually baked mine so that may have made a difference. But let me tell you, once I added the lime juice, I thought I was in heaven! Best fish I've ever eaten!

The flavors were amazing together. I baked it in the oven and did over bake it - I only had one fillet and it should have only gone  about 15-18 at 350. These flavors on the grill would be fantastic.

This is probably my new favorite way to make salmon.  My 5 year old who "hates salmon" actually told me this was awesome!

not sure what's so slammin' about this.  I let it marinade for 2 hrs and it really didn't have too much flavour.  A little dissapointing but ok overall. I would make it again but perhaps add some lime juice & top with fresh cilantro.

I only had time to marinate 1/2 hour but it still was excellent. 
Only change to ingredients was the oil. I had only EVOO on hand and thought unnecessary for 1/2 cup. So, used only 1/4 cup of that. 4 minutes each side was perfect for my average whole-fillet thickness (a little more than 1/2 in thick in center). I served with veggie kabobs (which I basted with the marinate, instead of throwing out) and Saffron rice. Will be making this often!

I've made this twice, and I didn't use the peanut oil. Each time I've allowed it to marinate for 6-8 hours. It's fantastic! This recipe got rave reviews from dinner guests last night.

Excellent! Followed the recipe as posted except I used lite soy sauce and seared the salmon in a heavy skillet indoors. The aroma that filled our home while it was cooking was making our mouths water! From the smells, to the color of the caramelization, to the fantastic flavor, this recipe is a winner! Thank you for sharing, "Aytom".

Fine dining quality!  I reduced the marinade and pan-sauteed the salmon in olive oil.  Served it with the reduction on top.  Delicious!!

This is definitely the BEST salmon recipe I've ever made!, I followed the recipe exactly and it was so yummy! When I want to give salmon to my kids, I have to tell them is pink piraña, so they find this exiting and eat it, well, yesterday, I told them it was salmon and they kept asking for more they LOVED IT!

This was really good. Tried it for the first time a couple days ago. Only made half of the salmon I had.  But wished I had marinated all of it. But guess what I have more marinating as I give this review. Thanks so much because it was SLAMMIN'

I love this recipe. The only thing I did differently was adding more crushed red pepper because we like spicy. A lot of salmon recipes I have tried rely heavily on soy sauce. I love how this recipe used soy sauce sparingly. The sesame and peanut oil give it a great flavor. Will make it again and again.

Made this great marinade as given - next time would change as follows
1) cut the balslamic vinegar in half 2) double the red pepper and green onions.
My plan is also to just double the whole recipe, then boil it after removing the salmon and serve as a sauce - Very delicious -
Served with the carmelized leeks recipe and fresh corn - 5 stars for sure

Super tasty and slightly spicy. GREAT!!! I actually didn't marinate this or grill it.  I put all of the salmon and ingredients in the oven at 425 degrees for 40 minutes.  I turned it half way through and kept basting it.

This is FANTASTIC!!  Truly loved it the whole family did!  I am usually a purest about salmon.  but this is really really good!  I marinated the only 3 fillets I had for 7 hours in my vacuum marinator.  (spelling) I will be making this again and again.   Thank you Atom for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I surprised my wife with this recipe and followed the suggestion from another reviewer. I baked and also used the sauce with wine to make a reduction sauce. This was a home run and she said it was the best meal I have ever made. She sautéed veggies in olive oil, wine and some reduction sauce. 5 stars!!!!

This is one of the best salmon recipe out there. Fish was so tasty, there was not a morsel left. I am surprised we don't have more reviews. Pepper flake gave it a bit of heat and the ginger and garlic gave it the perfect sour /sweet with the brown sugar. Loved it..A winner

I used almond oil instead of peanut Oil and didn't have sesame oil, and I added some cayenne pepper. This turned out SO good! And I don't normally like salmon!

Addictive salmon! I made exactly as listed the first time and have never seen the need to fool around with it (unusual for me)in the many times I have made it since. This salmon is also VERY good served cold with a lime mayo for dipping the chunks of salmon.

Meh, I'm sure this could've been better if I hadn't used the oil. It overpowered all the flavor, though the salmon was surprisingly moist.

Made as is (at least I think I did - the sesame oil is a bit of a surprise) - grilled to perfection!  Our new favorite - and that is from a house that is filled with salmon recipes and a wife who is sick and tired of eating salmon (but yet I still do)

WOW!  So simple and the flavor was out of this world.  I omitted the seasame seed oil but did use the peanut oil.  I marinated it for two days simply because my plans changed. I used my indoor grill and it was fab.

This was DELIC!!!! Amazing flavor! I omitted the peanut and sesame oil, didn't have any on hand, but followed all other instruction. I marinated for an hour and baked for 350 for 20min. While baking, I took the remaining marinade and added 3tblsp of white wine to it into a reduction. I poured it on top of the salmon and whoolah!!!!

The flavor was wonderful, I over cooked it though.  I think my grill was too hot.  I will try this again in the future.

So unbelievably moist & flavorful! Absolutely LOVED it!!! I used Evoo in place of the peanut oil, halved the red pepper flakes, black pepper, & oil. Absolute perfection for our tastes! Thank you!!

This was the best salmon I have ever had. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and eliminated the salt altogether. I think half of the oil would have been plenty. I ended up marinating for about a day and a half. I don't have a grill, so I just pan seared it and I boiled the leftover marinade and drizzled it over the fish when serving. Absolutely wonderful! This is a keeper.

I've made this recipe many times.  It is always wonderful every time, but the longer you can marinade the better.  I also must say that I can't imagine it tasting the same without the peanut or sesame oil.  I know other reviewers have made without them, but I really think they are missing out on this fabulous recipe by doing so.  The only difference I have had to make is baking it instead of grilling because I don't have a grill.

This is a delicious recipe.  Was raining so didn't use outdoor grill but used grill pan on stove top.  Wonderful.  Served it over arugula and romain with sliced grapes dressed with extra marinade.  Only variation in recipe was I didn't add any salt.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My whole family enjoyed it. It has a nice bit of heat to it, which is a welcome change from some of the salmon recipes we often use.  I marinated the salmon for about five hours.... Great flavor!

This was great! I made no changes to the marinade; it's perfect! I grilled these on a plank which only enhanced the already wonderful flavor. Thanks. I will definitely make this again!

I like (don't love) salmon, but I very much love this Slammin Salmon recipe.  My partner who wasn't looking forward to dinner tonight, said that I out-did myself with this recipe. I will look forward to making this again! One change: I didn't have brown, so I used molasses; also, I used oil and sesame oil for the marinade.  Try it!

I didn't have the special oils, so I used a bit of olive oil instead, and it was the best dang Salmon this side of the U.S.  I am definitely saving this one.

I didn't have salmon, but used shrimp instead.  I set aside about 1/4 cup of the marinade to use later.  I added the reserved marinade to some cooked spaghetti noodles and steamed green beans from the garden and served with the shrimp. My husband and 20 month old daughter dived right in.  I will make this again very soon.

Delicious. For my own delicate tummy, I will probably use less crushed red pepper. I also pan-fried it after marinating for an hour. Reduced the marinade while the salmon cooked and added fresh mushrooms to the marinade to simmer the last couple of minutes. Served over fettuccini noodles. Raves all around.

This is the best salmon that I ever made.  Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the peanut and sesame oil...didn't have on hand, so subbed Canola oil.....cooked on the grill, but instead of placing directly on the grill, I cooked the salmon on cedar planks in the grill.  The smoky flavor with the marinade was wonderful.  Had let the salmon marinate for a full eight hours.....wonderful recipe....can't wait to make it again.

This was awesome, shared it with my family. It was the first time my husband ever went back for seconds with salmon! The only thing I did different was I deleted the soy sauce to make it gluten free. Everything else was the same as the recipe. This will become a regular in our house!

WOW. I wasn't much of a salmon fan, but I am a convert now. This recipe is a crowd pleaser. I didn't have green onions so I substituted dehydrated chives and onion flakes. Worked great. I did use the remainder of the marinade in a reduction sauce and it made the dish. We served with baby red potatoes, steamed cauliflower, and french bread. Definitely a repeat.

Great flavor. I didn't add the additional peanut oil and I cooked down the marinade to make a glaze as others suggested. Make sure you oil your grill grates so it doesn't stick!

Very good!  I used less red pepper (I'm not a  big fan of spicy food) but otherwise kept everything the same.  I put together a batch then froze it so I could make it later; by doing that, all I had to do was toss it in the fridge the night before and come home to defrosted, marinated salmon steaks.  I baked this since it's getting chilly around here.  Thanks for the recipe!

FABULOUS! This is our new favorite salmon recipe. You cannot go wrong. We marinated for only 1 1/2 hrs and will do longer next time to achieve the full flavor. We also plan to save a little of the marinade (pre-fish) to drizzle over the top. Great flavor!

Very delicious! My 7-year old said it was the best salmon that he ever had, and salmon is one of his favorite foods. I left out the peanut oil and used only about a tablespoon of olive oil instead. I followed the directions for the rest of the marinade. I also pan-fried it - seared it first then turned down the heat. Wonderful!

This was very good.  I omitted the brown sugar because I wanted more savory than sweet.  I used sesame oil and a drizzle of chili oil instead of peanut oil.  I marinated about six hours.

We liked this alot, and it only marinated like 1 1/2 hours!  I can only imagine how good it will be when I try it next time after marinating it all day!  I added a bit less ginger, but other then that didnt change a thing! Yummy!  A keeper, as we say! Oh, yeah..I just used canola oil because I did nto have peanut oil.

I made this for my party. I marinated over night. I think I tripled the recipe, I had tons of salmon. I did not use the sesame oil did not have any and it still is great. I put it on the BBQ and it was perfect. I will use this all the time.

VERY good, I didn't have time to marinade more than 1 1/2 hours and it still turned out awesome.  I actually picked this receipe because I didn't have any cedar planks and I think I will just use this one from now on and skip the planks anyways.

I was disappointed with this marinade.  It didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much flavor at all.  Next time I will go with something more simple.  I felt like this was a waste of ingredients.

Excellent. I scaled the marinade down for 2 fairly large Scottish salmon fillets. I used jarred chopped ginger instead of ground and baked at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes. My husband who is a fish hater as a rule said this was the best salmon he's ever eaten and he would have this again. Thanks so much Aytom.

This is an awesome recipe.  I've made this twice in a week now and my wife loves it.  We ran out of peanut sauce and I substituted peanut butter and also used the wine reduction idea from another reviewer, and it was excellent.

This is very good.  I did not have the oils suggested, so I justed added 1tbs of olive oil.  I will make this again and thinking of other things to use it on.  I might increased the b sugar a little just for personal taste.  I love it!  I grilled it on a george foreman also.

I agree it was Slammin'. I left out the garlic (gasp!) because of an allergy to it, but it was still delicious. I also didn't have as much time to marinate it--only 30 mins. But, again, I think it came out flawless. I served it with a mixed herb salad and a fat piece of avocado. It's a flavorful recipe that doesn't overpower the salmon.

Very easy and yummy.  I've baked this in the oven 3 times now and broil it for a couple of minutes towards the end.  Waiting for bbq season.  I leave out the green onions if I don't have any on hand - still delicious.

This salmon was wonderful! Next time I will omit the peanut oil as I did not find the need for it (other than make it oily). I also added some cayenne pepper towards the end. 

Muy bueno :)

I marinated my salmon for about 6 hours and next time I will do even longer.  I subbed oilive oil for the peanut oil and the result was great.  Don't leave out the sesame oil!  It adds that flavor and aroma that make it special.  The marinade imparts a very nice flavor to the fish.  I lined my bbq with heavy duty foil and grilled the salmon.  It took quite a bit longer, on low, to cook than the recipe stated.  Very good!

This is simply the best salmon I ever ate (and made) in my life!  I used all the suggested ingredients and marinated for a full day before grilling.  It was perfect!  Everybody loved it, even those that thought it would of been too spicy and doesn't like salmon ate every last bite!

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil and it was still great.  I will definitly make this again but I am going to use peanut oil to see if it is needed.  I think the sesame oil is necessary you could taste it in the background so I wouldn't substitute that with anything else.

So good!  I put off trying this recipe because my husband doesn't like teriyaki and this sounded teriyaki-like to me.  We both really liked it!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly only because I wasn't planning to make it and I had to use what I had.  I tossed in garlic powder because I didn't have garlic cloves.  I did butter instead of all of the oils because I had already melted it (planned to use a different recipe) and I didn't have the others anyway, put some onion powder instead of green onions...it was still great!  I would love to try the recipe as written at some point, but it's nice to know that it's flexible! I also just cooked it in the oven with my veggies and didn't marinate it.  As I said, I wasn't planning this so there was no time for it to sit and marinate.

FANTASTIC marinade. Followed recipe exactly, was delicious and super easy to pull together. Marinated for 24 hours. Thank you reviewers for all the great tips. I did save the marinade and cooked it with some white wine. At the end I added some black beans and corn. I turned this salmon dish into a salad and served everything on spring greens with additional green onions, chopped cilantro, jalapeños  and chopped unsalted peanuts. I small dash of vinaigrette at the end to balance out all flavors. The salad was ah-mazing.  Hub’s said this recipe is a keeper and I couldn’t agree more. Cheers

Wowzers!!  This is a fantastic recipe!  My small alterations were 1tsp peanut butter vs peanut oil - I might add a touch more next time but that's all to personal taste.  I also pan fried the entire marinade and salmon on high heat. The salmon is cooked in a few minutes each side and marinade reduces during and in additional minute longer.  Yum!!

Excellent flavor! Easy to make. The salmon turned out tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  It’s our newest favorite!  We had left over salmon that we ate for breakfast on a toasted bagel with onions, cream cheese and tomato.

It was amazing.  Followed the instructions and will definitely do this one again.  Like the suggestions of the white wine and marinade others have proposed.  The only thing was it was a little too lemony but will adjust that the next time.  Really enjoyed this recipe.

Turned out great. I substituted sriracha for the crushed red pepper. Make sure your grill is very hot to avoid sticking.

I followed the recipe exactly but I cut down the peanut oil to just a few tablespoons and it was fabulous. I also cooked it in an air fryer. Huge hit and will make it again and again. Going to try it with chicken and pork too.

Really good recipe. The flavour was mild enough that it didn't overpower the flavour of the salmon. My son (VERY picky eater!) said it made it taste like chicken (a total compliment!) and my Dad, who typically doesn't like salmon, said that he would have this again! The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I'd like to see if I can punch up the flavour a bit. It has potential as an Asian dish but I'm not really tasting those flavours. Looking forward to giving this another go! Thanks for sharing!

Our go-to salmon recipe whether we grill, bake or sauté it.  Wonderful flavor.  I’l try the sauce reductions others have described. I think that will make the meal even better!  Thanks!

Delicious. I made it once super quick, no marinating, with just a T of toasted sesame oil rather than the other oils and fresh ginger rather than powdered. It was excellent.

The folks I made this for liked it better than I did - in fact they loved it. It was easy and quick - I poured the salmon and marinade into a glass pan and baked at 350 for 15 minutes and everything was done perfectly. Only one pan to clean up - it doesn't get a lot easier than that.

I made this salmon recipe and it was delicious! I cooked it in the oven on convection roast at 450° because it was too rainy to grill. I also basted the salmon every 3 minutes with some reserved marinade. Perfect flavors for Asian inspired taste.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 tbsp oil (olive insted of peanut), but otherwise made no changes. This was amazing, probably the best salmon recipe I've tried!

A very flavorful salmon that my daughter and I both liked. I marinated for 8 hours, but husband said he could barely taste it. If I make again, I will try to marinate longer.

Family loved this simple recipe.  Adjusted because of dietary issues to less sugar, no salt and low sodium soy, but turned out great.  Definitely a keeper recipe for us.

Very tasty, easy to make and cook. It might have a tad too much vinegar OR lemon juice...I will decrease the vinegar qty slightly next time, see if that "softens" it a bit. Otherwise a complete HIT.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it last night. I didn't have original soy sauce but used an Asian replacement that's more of a soybean sauce. I also didn't add the sesame or peanut oil. It turned out great!

I give this a 4 star very tasty no doubt, I would not use 1/4 of a cup of soy sauce maybe half of that. I used Himalayan pink salt very tasty. I also only marinated the salmon under a hour and also only took 30 mins in the oven for the last 5 mins I do put it in the broiler still was nice a moist can't wait to make it again.

We liked this, but not as much as another Asian flavored salmon that we make on a regular basis. It does have a little kick from the crushed red pepper. Glad we gave it a try.

This is the second time I am making this. The first time I used Salmon in a cast iron pan & cooked it on the gas stove top. Tonight I am using Steelhead Trout & following the recipe exactly. I put the fish & sauce in the fridge overnight (approx. 12 hours. I will use a 1/2 cup of Pinot Grigio to reduce the sauce and make a glaze. I plan to serve this with garlic red potatoes & Brussel sprouts with bacon. I am bringing this meal to a friend tonight that HATES fish & I am betting it will turn her around (fingers crossed). This recipe is awesome!

Too complicated as is. Mix balsamic, brown sugar, soy, ginger, chili paste/crushed red pepper/cayenne. Spoon over salmon and let sit for 20 minutes or so. Roast. Delicious.

I marinated the salmon overnight and saved the leftover marinade to reduce. I baked it instead of grilling it. It was amazing! This will be in my regular menu.

This worked out perfect, subbed a refined olive oil for peanut oil and marinated about 6 hours. Grilled perfectly with tons of flavor. Served with grilled pineapple salsa & jasmine rice.

This is probably one of my favorite salmon marinades. I've added this to our regular rotation, it's delicious and very simple. I've made this as written with no modifiers and it's great.

Amazing. Marinated for 1 hour, can't imagine what explosion of flavor it would have if I marinated overnight. I baked it in a tin boat for 20 min at 400 degrees. Making this again for sure!

Great salmon recipe!  I had my doubts as I was preparing this, but these ingredients came together deliciously.  I prepared it per the recipe without any changes.

Both my husband and I loved it. This is definitely a keeper.

I added a bit more ginger and brown sugar, less garlic.  Next time will reduce the oil.

Fabulous! My husband said it was the best salmon he's every had. I read a few reviews and did not use the peanut oil. I did a tablespoon of sesame oil and only marinated it 2 hours. It was very, very good! Thank you!! Great recipe.

This is the best salmon ever!!! The only thing I changed was omitting the salt since I used soy sauce and I didn't have time to marinate and it was so good. Tonight im trying it with chicken.

My new favorite salmon recipe!  I fish in Alaska every summer, I have a freezer full of salmon filets, so we eat a lot of it, this was the best recipe so far.  I made a double batch of marinade to accommodate more fish, I might use just a little less lemon next time.  Just before cooking it I took a small sieve and scooped out onions and some of the spices out of the marinade and put it on top of the filets before grilling...glad I did, YUM!  My filets are a little thicker than the usual farm salmon, so I grilled it for 5 minutes on each side...perfect.  Just a little bit of kick, but not too much, and not enough to mask the true flavor of the salmon...I'm going to try this on other varieties of fish too.

My husband doesn't particularly like salmon but we gave this one a try. He liked it very much in fact he wants to make it for some friends. I made it according to the given directions. Only thing I did different is to serve that delicious marinade as a sauce for the salmon. Thus next time I will make extra marinade for that purpose.

Delicious! I baked half of them in the oven and the other half I cooked in the skillet on the stove in the marinade. My family all preferred the one in the skillet. The marinade is delicious. Followed the recipe to a tee. No need to change a thing!

This is a very good salmon marinade.  It also works very well on fresh caught trout.  I cook it on the grill on a cedar plank which gives it a nice flavor boost.  I only use 1/4 cup peanut oil and that is plenty.  An ex-boyfriend turned me on to this recipe and it was the best thing I got out of that relationship...lol

This was great! I ended up poking holes in the salmon before leaving it to marinate for ~4 hours, and it seeped into the salmon perfectly, although I may try baking it at a lower heat for longer next time. The flavours were great together--Delish!

My new favorite salmon recipe, thank you for putting this up! I honestly didnt follow the measurements at all since i just made it for two pieces of salmon, but i eyeballed them all making sure it followed the same proportions. I did not have peanut oil and green onions with me, i didnt put in red pepper flakes. and the ginger i used was fresh, which i think made all the difference! The taste of ginger in the dish was the best part. So if i were you, id amp up the amount of ginger (fresh and grated!). I also think the sesame oil was key to the marinade. I could taste it and it was very flavorful. Altogether, what a great salmon recipe!

I used only a pinch of red pepper flakes, and it was still too hot for me. My only problem with today's modern recipes, is the assumption that everyone likes spicy food. I reduced the marinade to a sauce. Very good. Will use zero red pepper next time.

I have made this at least five times and it has never failed me. I have let it marinate as long as 48 hours but I wouldn't go more than that as the fish will change texture when cooked. It is really good marinated 8-12 hours (I know people say you should not marinate fish that long but it was great). I have grilled, broiled and baked the fish and by far grilling and broiling have turned out the best. I grill it by using a foil covered grill or baking pan and place it directly on the heat for 8 or so no minutes and I do NOT flip the fillets. Same with broiling. I do spoon a bit of the marinade on the fish prior to cooking. I serve this with coconut rice and steamed snap peas and my family inhales ALL of it.

Slammin' Salmon Haiku: "Indeed it's 'slammin'. I only did one small swap, followed all the rest." Reduced the recipe for four small salmon fillets, and used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil, otherwise, all ingredients were the same. This was one tremendously tasty fish!

I followed this recipe except I didn't have peanut oil, so I used another. But it was great. Very nice flavor! We have a special pan to use on the grill. Spray it with olive oil so the fish doesn't stick, but it makes nice charred grill marks. We will use this marinade again and again.

Let me start by saying I do not like salmon.  I know it's  a healthy food to eat so I have tried lots of different recipes.  This recipe made it easy to eat, it's the first time my family has finished all the salmon I have made.  I used coconut oil instead of the peanut because I didn't have any peanut oil.  I also topped the salmon with freshly grated ginger before cooking.  I think marinating it takes away some of the fishy tendency of salmon.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

simple and delicious. Did not have any peanut oil or green onions but I don't even know if it needed it.  Marinated for two hours and then put on a fiery hot grill for four minutes per side. Could have probably used one more minute. But it was really delicious and will definitely make again. It is right up there with the all recipes firecracker Alaskan salmon.  Used the leftovers for a nice salad for lunch.

Delicious!!!  I used olive oil because I didn't have any peanut and I only marinated about an hour and a half.  Baked in the oven and reduced the marinade to make a sauce.  I will definitely make this again soon!

This recipe really is incredible, both in its taste and ease!  I have two picky eaters who aren't fans of fish, and they BOTH loved this salmon- my 6-yr-old requests it almost weekly.  Made it almost exactly as written (subbed veg oil for peanut) and it was perfect!

I love this recipe.  I make it almost every time we have salmon!  It has a nice Asian-ish flavour and a buttery texture.  I love the bit of spice from the red pepper flakes.  love it love it love it!

so we tried this last night, after marinating 4 or 5 hours. I subbed safflower oil for the peanut, and used 1/2 the called-for freeze-dried chives instead of fresh. I thought it was decent, but prefer the similar but sweeter Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon on this site. Hubby preferred this marinade instead, so I guess we'll keep them both around.

wonderful sauce! I added a tsp more of sea salt, doubled the crushed garlic, and brown sugar. I also replaced the peanut oil with a 1/4 cup of olive oil, and added a 1/4 cup of sesame oil. I actually marinated the salmon in the sauce for an hour and then following the advice of others, I covered the salmon and baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, and reduced the marinade in a sauce pan with 1/4 cup of white wine for another 15 minutes. I served the glaze over the salmon next to a bed of brown basmati rice and garlic green beans. Fabulous!

I too make this without the sesame or peanut oil and bake it in the oven. It is amazing! I have made it for several guests and every single one of them has told me it is the best salmon they've ever had. You can boil the extra marinade with 1/4 cup of cooking wine while the fish is baking to make a sauce to drizzle over the top before serving. A little goes a long way though.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  Only cook 4 servings at a time so I halved it.  Marinated 2+ hours.  Grilled on the BBQ along with foil wrapped summer squash.  Superb!

I have made this dozens of times and everyone raves about it; even people who say they do not like salmon prior to eating it. The marinade takes the strong fishy taste out of the salmon. I cook this at least 2 times a month.

Used one large salmon filet, marinated for 24 hours and baked in a foil packet at 400 for 25 minutes and it came out great.  I served this with a kale quinoa salad for a beautiful, tasty and healthy meal - great recipe!

Everyone in my family loved this dish except my picky youngest who thought it was too spicy.  I didn't have green onions or peanut oil, but it was still lovely, even after only marinating for 1.5 hours. I took one review's advice and cooked the salmon in the marinade in a pan and it was absolutely delish!  Saving it to make again.  Thanks!

If you are used to plain salmon, this is fine. However, as a marinade, it's nothing special.  And the ingredients don't all go together that well.

(I followed the recipe exactly only used fresh ginger, minced, instead of ground. Marinated for 8 hours. Cooked on the stovetop in the marinade, vs. on the grill,  then removed salmon and reduced remaining sauce. Served with brown rice and honey glazed carrots.)

It does taste better than it smells.

There is too much oil, which separates, and when you try to reduce it at the end, it does not combine/stays separated.

It needs less oil, a tad more sugar. As someone else has said, you're probably better off with an Asian marinade (add lime  instead of lemon to this, use all sesame oil - a coupe of tablespoons only, no peanut oil, no balsamic); or a bourbon glaze. 

My family all ate it without complaints, but rated it as "don't bother making again."

Made this for dinner tonight. Couldn't grill so I had to bake it (15 mins in a 400 degree oven). I kept the filet whole and only had 2 hours to marinate it (doubled over in an airtight, large ziplock bag). I served it with garlic rice and oven roasted broccoli. It was a big hit and my family loved it! I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty and very simple recipe. I broiled the salmon and it was perfect.  Instead of the vinegar I used cooking white wine. The salmon was bursting with flavor.

Delicious!   I made this recipe exactly as written, except for the green onions (didn't have any).  I put some salmon in the marinade before work and cooked it on the stovetop after work, so it marinated for about 9 hours.  Like other reviews, I reduced the remaining marinade to make a sauce.

I served the salmon with some sauce and chopped green onions on top.  two great things about this recipes: easy to make the marinade ahead of time, and the flavor was very balanced, not one overwhelming flavor.

I served it with Roasted Garlic Cauliflower (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Roasted-Garlic-Cauliflower).

Marinated for about eight hours and the final dish was delicious - very tasty! I would like to try it on other things too, such as chicken!
Rather than peanut oil, I used olive oil. I did use the sesame oil though. I also had to cook it in the oven. Finished it off under the oven grill. Worked fine.

We enjoyed this very much. Next time, will only add tsp of each oil, and likely cut down on the soy sauce to spare our sodium intake. Soy sauce  is powerful enough, I don't think it needs that much.  We marinated for 4 hours and seemed to be more than enough time.

Wow, this was the best salmon ever. Really delicious.  I marinaded two hours, did not use the peanut oil and only used half the red pepper which I will bump up the next time.

This was very average. I was expecting great things by the way it smelled and then the fish had very little flavor.  I did reduce the marinade and use that on rice and that had a nice flavor. Overall, I would not bother making this recipe again.

I was really impressed by this recipe especially after all the good reviews it received.I followed the recipe as written with the exceptions of less onions (all I had) and less pepper flakes since hubby doesn't like spicy. I also marinated it for the full 24 hours. I thought the combination of ingredients couldn't possible go wrong with the taste. Wrong! The marinade overpowered the salmon completely. I also took the advice of another reader and kept half the marinade and reduced it to pour over the cooked salmon. Reducing it only made it separate and become totally inedible. I have other salmon recipes that taste better and would never call this the best salmon I ever made. Disappointing is what I would call it because I even made more than called for so I would have leftovers because I was so sure I would like it. It was a waste of my salmon and I will not be making this again. Sorry Aytom, this just didn't suit us and I love all the components that made up the recipe.

I didn't have the peanut or the sesame oil or the ginger, but this still turned out great. Favorite salmon recipe so far.

Really pretty good.  Halved the peanut oil to cut calories.  A bit owrried about it being too spicy for the kids but it turned out not spicy at all.  Will likely make again but the Delicious Salmon recipe from this site is hands down the best salmon!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I cooked in oven instead of a grill.  Every ingredient and I have to say I have so many other better salmon recipes that I won't be making this again. Sorry!  Gave it 2 stars because it was edible.

I made this and put half in freezer in marinade and half in fridge over night.  Got screaming hot skillet with alittle oil.  Seared skin side down for 3=4 minutes and finished in 400 degree oven for  about 10 minutes. I don't care for salmon plain but I like it like this.

This was easy to make, and delicious. I left the salt out, and added one garlic clove, I put in a bag to marinate and went on to prepare desert. When my cake was out of the oven, a little over one hour later, I took the salmon and just poured everything in a skillet, covered and heated up the garlic-herbs mashed potatoes. Served also a beet-root salad. It was one of the most successful dinner so far!

Delicious. I wrapped salmon along with marinade in aluminum foil then put in the broiler on high for anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes depending on how thick the fillet. This kept it moist and it just falls apart in the marinade when you stick a fork in it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! My husband was tired of the same old stuff and when I stumbled upon this recipe he decided to give it a try, so glad we found it because the taste, texture and smell was wonderful! We made it exactly as the recipe said and the fish came out flaky but not dry and was enjoyed by all.

This is an amazing recipe and super easy!  Next time I will cut back on the red pepper but, otherwise, perfect. I cooked it on the grill with hickory and served it with the left over marinade (reduced). YUM!

I made this for the second time last night and we just loved it!!!!  Like other reviewers I left out the peanut oil and it turned out great!  I also baked it at 375 for 20 -25 mins (mine were still partially frozen) and they were just amazing!  These are going to be a regular staple at our house.

This is a recipe that you cannot mess up. I think any combination of the ingredients would work great!  I made the marinade with the ingredients I had (left out green onions and sesame oil). I didn't have time to marinade it so I prepped the marinade and let the salmon soak in it while I prepped the rest of the food. I cooked this in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes and poured the marinade and the salmon into foil to cook it. This allowed it to marinade a little more.   I also used this with frozen salmon filets (which are not typically the best tasting). My boyfriend said that this was the perfect way to fix frozen salmon. Highly recommended!

This marinade is unbelievable!!!! I wouldn't change a thing and follow it to the T every time. The peanut oil and sesame oil give it such a nice flavor. It creates this delicious coating of flavor that carmelizes to the salmon, but does not over the flavor of the salmon, so that really peaks through.  Served this with rice and Snow Peas Oriental which is great because it makes a lot of sauce which goes great with the sauce, and it has a similar flavor, so it's perfect.  Our new thing is to serve it on a salad - I use this recipe for the salmon but the dressing from 'Grilled Salmon, Snap Peas and Spring Mix Salad with Chow Mein Noodles' and tofu using the marinade from 'Grilled Tofu Skewers with Sriracha Sauce' from Allrecipes - it's so good. We throw in edamame, hearts of palm, chow mein noodles, almonds and eat it on spinach.

i hate to say, this recipe is not slammin'. maybe i let it marinate too long (20ish hours? it was under 24), but even using low-sodium soy sauce this was wayyyy too salty. the rave reviews make me want to try again but i will not let the fish marinate as long and i will likely add some honey to temper the saltiness. two stars for being easy and smelling quite promising.

Very good salmon, says my daughter. I baked and then broiled it, rather than grilling it, and cut down on the oil a considerable amount, but otherwise made as per the recipe. Thanks!

This recipe is great! I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I made some modifications. I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, and i used olive oil. I also didn't have ground ginger, so I used minced fresh ginger.   Delicious!

Our whole family thought this was the best salmon we've ever eaten. Used Norwegian salmon, marinated only 3 hours, but had great fullness of flavor. Served with a bok choy salad on the side. Delicious, light summer bbq. Followed the recipe exactly.

This is wonderful. I left out the peanut oil and accidentally added almost twice as much garlic as called for, but it still came out beautifully. The marinade is absolutely delicious reduced with 1/4 cup Merlot red wine in a frying pan for about 5 minutes and poured over the fish. I used fresh ginger instead of ground.

I marinated the salmon over night and it was amazing. The taste was great. The only ingredients I kept out were the oils.

DH and I are not seafood fans, for health reasons we are attempting the salmon. Thankyou, Thank you, thank you. We both enjoyed these fillets, enough flavor to mask the fishy taste of salmon.

I was not too happy with the marinade.  It had some off taste to it, but I'm not sure what it was.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. It had a great flavor, and the fact that it passed the hubby test means I'm definitely making it again.

By far one of the best recipes for salmon.  I marinated by maybe a half hour in a ziploc bag.  Make sure to push all the air out, that way the juices can really saturate the fish.  Love it!  I make it all the time.

Awesome, will make this again and again.  It is easy and flavorful, the marinade doesnt over power the natural flavor of the fish. Thank you for a great recipe.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I eat salmon at restaurants at every opportunity but I think this was the best salmon I have ever eaten.  Very moist and wonderful flavor.  I only had the fillets in the marinade for app 2 hours but it was very adequate.

OUTSTANDING!  I only had two thin Alaskan sockeye salmon filets so I cut the recipe in half.  It was the perfect amount of marinade.  I followed the recipe 99% (I could not find peanut oil at my grocery store so I left it out).  The sauce had just the right amount of "heat" from the red pepper flakes.  Baked at 450 degrees for 7-8 minutes but cannot wait to grill using this marinade.  Slammin' Good Salmon!

i was not that into this but my husband certainly was, and he's the fish eater in the house, so we'll go with his opinion over mine. i left out the peanut oil altogether and used the foreman grill.

A really great flavor for salmon.  I subbed fresh ginger for ground and it was fabulous.  Makes a lot of marinade though, next time I will cut in half.  Thanks for my new favorite salmon recipe.

We loved this! We made a few changes - we didn't have ginger or sesame oil. My husband added about some cane syrup (his spice of the season) to the marinade. We cooked it on a cedar plank and will definitely do it again!

This marinade is delicious!  The peanut oil was omitted due to allergies.  I was in a hurry, so I only marinated the salmon for 30 min.  Also, I didn't drain the marinade; instead, I poured it all into a skillet and cooked the salmon (~5 min/side).  The marinade caramelized in the pan and would probably make a nice sauce upon addition of a mild white wine.  I'll try that next time, as my husband was disappointed to see any of the flavor go to waste!

This recipe was yummy! However I should have cooked the salmon for longer. I served it with new potatoes and salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar.
