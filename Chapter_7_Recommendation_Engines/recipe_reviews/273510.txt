Hello--I followed the recipe, including the quantities and measurements. The only thing different for me was that I have a 7-qt. crockpot (?!).  I realize that, using a larger unit means a hotter, shorter cooking time... but, at 3 hours, I felt the meat was overdone.  I know this is a constant risk with pork, so for me, it's back to the drawing board. But, one idea when offering crockpot recipes: Suggest that the user test his/her unit, to see what the temps really are at "low."  One of the main complaints I see on forums for new crockpots is that they are too hot , even at low settings.  Regards!
