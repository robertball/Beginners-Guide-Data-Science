I make this recipe all the time, use only juice of 1/2 lemon, try adding about 1 tspn each of cumin and "7" spice, or allspice.  I turn the broiler on for the last 20-15 minutes until all the lemon juice evaporates.

Very simple and pure dish.  Excellent!  This is not another one of those boring recipes that calls for tons of cheese and canned creamy soups for flavor.  I will make this weekly.  Thanks!  :)

I love this dish. Although I cut my potatoes into thick (about 3/4" thick) and then fry them until a little dark golden brown. While I am frying the potatoes, I boil the chicken in water. After the potatoes are all fried. I place them on the bottom of the baking dish, place the chicken on top. I add the lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and some broth from the chicken to the dish. Along with the salt & pepper, I do add the 7 spice to it and then broil for about 5 minutes. It's so yummy!!

I'm surprised more people didn't emphasize how important it is to marinate this dish. I seasoned with salt, white pepper, cumin and all spice and I let it sit for a couple minutes before cooking. Next time I'll marinate with the lemon juice and olive for more flavor. I used chicken legs and the chicken was tender and juicy, but cooked a lot faster than the instructions stated.

Remember to use yellow potatoes, other varieties do not work as well.

I've made this dish a couple times now and it's definitely one of our favorites. We love the tangy flavor of the chicken & potatoes, but 1 whole cup of lemon juice is way too much for our taste. I now only use 1/2 cup. I've made this using either fresh lemon or 100% juice from concentrate and it has turned out great both times. The recipe is tasty as-is, but this last time I made it I also added 1/4 tsp oregano & 1/4 tsp thyme to the seasonings and we really loved the additional flavor. This is a keeper & a repeater in our house. Thank you for the great recipe! :)

I've made this many times and it's always good.  My favorite variation is to use half sweet potatoes and half white potatoes.  Warning:  bone-in chicken comes out moist and delicious, boneless breasts come out dry.

That sure was easy to prepare alright! Baked it longer than required because my husband loves his chicken very well done. Could have used more garlic and salt but I say that with most recipes. Loved it thanks!

Delicious!  I added a bit of cumin and thyme, and doubled the garlic.  It was great with steamed green beans - we'll be having this again.

I think this is a good starter recipe, but a little too bland for my taste, so I used 2 chx breasts, two yukon gold potatoes sliced thin, only a 1/4 cup of oil, the juice of three small lemons, and some sliced onion and garlic.  In a small bowl I combined the oil, a scoop of dijon mustard and some oregano and salt and pepper and poured over the chx.  Omg, so yummy and healthy to boot!  Even better the next day cold.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was excellent!  Ended up using 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/4 olive oil and marinaded seasoned, boneless chicken breast for about 30 minutes then mixed in the potatoes.  After the full hour of cooking I pulled the chicken out of the pan and covered with foil to keep warm and then put the potatoes under the broiler to crisp them up a bit.  Chicken was nice and moist, did not dry out at all.  This is a keeper in our house for sure.

I gave this 3 stars because the flavors were really not there. I like this as a base but will tweak next time by throwing in some oregano, garilc salt, cumin, and whatever else I find in my pantry! Overall, was ok.

Great recipe!  I added cumin, rosemary, and thyme plus quartered onions and sliced carrots. The potatoes took longer to cook than the chicken (perhaps I wasn't using the correct kind). Next time I will cut the potatoes into smaller, bite-size pieces.  We ate the left-overs for lunch the next day and, having marinated all night, it was even better.

The method used to cook the chicken is great! The meat came out moist and the skin crispy and flavorful. I agree with another review that said it was  a bit sour. I added the full cup of lemon juice but next time I think half will be enough, the potatoes ended up a bit on the sour side because they really soaked up the juices. I also think this could be spiced up a bit, maybe some fresh parsley on top?

I tried this on Monday. The lemon made it too tangy but my two fussy housemates ate all of it. Good recipe though...next time will reduce amount of lemon.

Even after adding additional spices and marinading the chicken I found it to be very bland. I was looking forward to a nice lemony chicken and potato dish and this one did not deliver. I give it two stars because the chicken was moist and the potatoes well cooked. I wouldn't bother making it again, just not enough flavor for us.

This was amazing. I let the juices soak in while the oven preheated and this was delicious. I might consider marinating longer if time allowed but if not, it's still great. The potatoes are perfect. But as the other reviewer said, the chicken meat itself doesn't seem to get the flavor as well as the skin does. Might consider that when marinating....

Being lebanese myself I have made this dish many times but I season chicken and potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and add some oil while its baking.  I smash about 5 garlic cloves and juice 1-1.5 lemons and pour it over the chicken and potatoes after its done baking.  Very flavorful!

Very good base recipe. I halved the amount of lemon juice and added cumin, oregano, and allspice as suggested by other reviewers. I skinned the chicken but it was still a bit oily for us so I would cut down on the olive oil next time. I also added large chunks of zucchini and onions to make it more of a one pot meal. Instead of using foil I just used a dish with a glass cover. Very simple to make. I prepped everything in the morning but mixed half the liquid with the veggies and the other half on top and the potatoes didn't brown at all while marinating in the fridge. I will definitely try this again using whatever veggies I have on hand. Carrots or broccoli would be good too, I think.

I like how easy this is to throw together.  As another reviewer mentioned, if you use the breast part of the chicken, it will be dry.  I added some chop onion for extra flavor.

The store only had skinless boneless breast and I think it would have been juicier with bone in pieces. The flavor was still good, the potatoes were delicious. I will try again with bone in chicken.

Very good recipe but it did take longer than they said. I also used extra garlic, that doesn't hurt anything. lol.

Not to be mean, but I am not sure why this has so many high ratings.  Really just baked chicken, nothing special.  I was not impressed.  It wasnt bad, but I would prefer to do something different.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Could not be any simpler or more delicious.  I have tried this with both boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and then a whole cut up chicken.  The chicken pieces with skin and bone DEFINITELY work better.  Comes out tasting like a moist, flavorful roast chicken with a delicious sauce.  We like to have this with the potatoes in the dish, AND white rice on the side to sop up the sauce.  (Also good served with pita bread.)  Great with broccoli as a side dish to put the lemon sauce on, as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great, the only thing I would do differently is use less lemon juice, because the potatoes really soaked up the taste, which is great, but they became a bit TOO lemony for us. Other than that, this is wonderful! The chicken came out  super moist and teh skin on it was nice and slightly crisp, delicious!  I used thighs.

I probably use less than a cup of lemon juice. I also keep it covered longer- like 40-45 under the foil at 425. Then I uncover and raise the temp! It's a great recipe and comes out a winner every time. Simple and good. Thanks!!

Tasty! I followed advice from other reviewers and used juice of 1/2 lemon instead of a full cup. I salted and peppered the chicken,  sprinkled paprika and Herbes de Provence on top before pouring the olive oil/lemon juice mixture over it. I don't think I used the full amount of oil either. The garlic really makes it, although mine began to burn. Did anyone else have this problem? I think maybe next time I will turn the heat up to 450 for the second part, or leave it at 425 a bit longer and then turn up the heat to brown. I used only one large russet potato, sliced. That's all that would fit on the deep cookie tray I used (covered in foil). My husband said he wouldn't have changed anything and it was fine as I made it, so thanks for the recipe.

This was so delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe to the T and it came our perfect.  I was worried that the lemon juice/sauce would be greasy from the chicken but it had great flavor. My only suggestion is to turn the broiler on after baking to brown the potatoes and chicken.  About 5 min to render out the last bit of fat on the chicken and to crisp it up.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was really easy to make. The over all flavor was good but the kids (3) thought it was too lemony. Next time I will use a yellow potato, I used red and they were mushy, and less lemon. But it was great with leg quarters.

This dish was OK.  I used boneless breasts and didn't cook them the whole time with the potatoes.  I added a dash of 5-spice when I seasoned them up as someone suggested.  I may try it again with the bone-in chicken pieces and see how it turns out.

Baked a small portion of  it before guests arrived and make it exactly like the recipe states but it was so bland.  My son said the potatoes were weird (strong lemon flavor). I quickly made 2 major adjustments to the remaining uncooked portion. I covered the entire dish with Greek Seasoning (Spice Hunter) and poured off the lemon-oil-garlic liquid that the chicken marinated in for several hours. The seasoning gave it exactly what it needed and the marinade had done it's job.  Light lemon-garlic taste with herbs--It was great! Tried to make a customized recipe but only get a pop up for payment.

I made this for dinner tonight and we thought it was just ok.  It was definitely lacking in flavor - even though I heavily seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and allspice.  The end result wasn't terrible, but it just wasn't very flavorful.

We LOVED this! I opted to season the chicken (I used thighs, that I removed the skin from) also with oregano and a little rosemary. I did cut the oil in 1/2 to make it healthier and just used the juice of 2 VERY juicy lemons and that was perfect for us. I also didn't cover this at all while baking, because I wanted it to roast. I will definately be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Awesome recipe.  I used drumsticks, and I used the juice of 3 lemons, so not quite full cup- closer to a half.  I also tucked in 4 roma tomatoes and 4 anaheim peppers into the baking dish so I could have a one dish meal.  Man it was sooooo good.  THe sauce this recipe makes is really good.  I had to keep going back for more bread to sop it all up. THe only thing I will do differently next time is to turn on the broiler during the last few minutes to get my chickn browner.  THis is a kepper though, totally.

This dish was great. Every bite tasted meltingly of lemon. Using bone-in, skin-on thighs worked great for me - very juicy, and skin was fantastically crispy. Will definitely make again, with a few revisions: lessen the amount of oil by at least half, replace half the lemon juice with dry white wine, add 1 T crushed dried rosemary, and split the dish into 2 9x13 pans. Also, be aware that olive oil has a relatively low smoke point, so when you open your oven during the 2nd half of cooking, a small amount of smoke may come out. Went great with some sauteed spinash, would also be great with sauteed broccoli tossed in juices. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good- I used a little less oil then the recipe calls for. I used 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I also seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt. Itw as a little bland for me, but that's probably because I remove the skin, which I'm sure is the best part. My husband loved it. I wonder if anyone removed the skin first before cooking so the flavor is on the meat itself? I think next time I will do that with the breast portions, and leave the skin on the rest of the pieces.

Pretty good recipe. Do cut back on the lemon juice, there is plenty of lemon flavor with 1/2 the amount. I also added carrots to the dish. If I'm making a one dish meal, it needs a few veggies.

Husband and I really, really enjoyed this dish.  No need to marinate; absolutely delicious without having to think about it hours before.  On Weight Watchers, so made changes: 2 skinned & boned chicken breasts, baby potatoes, halved (not peeled), black pepper, added cumin and oregano (per other reviewers), about 1/3 cup lemon juice (from 1 pretty big lemon), decreased oil to about 1-1/2 tablespoons.  Baked covered for 20 minutes, uncovered for an additional 20 minutes without increasing heat.  Covered dish once out of the oven while I finished preparing a green salad, about 10 minutes.  Chicken was wonderfully juicy and tender, potatoes nice and tender.  The cumin and oregano really made the dish, I think; very complementary flavors.  Lemony, but not overpowering.  Absolutely first rate.  Easy enough for weeknight dinner, but I would definitely serve this to company, carrying the Lebanese theme out with fresh pita, spinach with pine nuts and feta cheese, and maybe a nice knafeh.

Made this according to the recipe, with the exception of putting 1 tsp of ground cumin, and only putting in 1/2 a cup of the lemon juice. It was pretty lemon packed, I wasn't able to taste much of the garlic (And I put extra in) so maybe next time I'd like to saute the garlic in the oil before, then marinade. It got good comments from the hubby and a friend, so I'll make it again sometime!

When cooking boneless chicken breast, cut baking time down.  Use appropriate size dish so it's able to sit in it's juices.

Delicious as written.  I want to let you know that I did follow a recommendation to use bone in chicken parts, and the meat was tender and moist.  Also, I could not find Lemon Juice as I was rushing through the grocery, so I used 1/2 a cup lime juice, and a 1/2 cup of Simply lemonade.  I am only writing that to let you know if you dont have Lemon Juice on hand, you can improvise.  We will definitely be making this one again!

I loved this dish. It was a great launching point for suggestions by others. I added 1t. of allspice and 1t. of cumin. I also halved the lemon juice for preference purposes. I dumped everything into a large bowl, pierced my chicken pieces and marinated it for about 1 1/2 hours. I placed the chicken into a 9x13 dish then added the potatoes to the bowl to cover with the marinade. I then dumped the potatoes and the marinade all on top of the chicken. I baked it at 425 for 40 min. and then at 500 for an additional 20. It was perfect!
The chicken was really tender and the flavor was a nice change.

I thought this was too lemony but the rest of my family did not.  I will still cut back on the lemon next time but still overall very good.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and they did not turn out dry at all.

Excellent! and so easy, too! I cook once every week or so, when my wife needs to work late. She usually leaves instructions for me, but occasionally I'm in charge of planning the meal. Tonight was such a night. So, given the instructions of 'do something with chicken and potatoes', I searched online and quickly found this recipe. It sounded simple enough. (Thanks to my wife for having the necessary ingredients on hand.) After reading a few of the helpful reviews from others, I decided to alter the recipe a little and start cooking. End result: my wife was AMAZED. This definitely will be a repeat recipe if she has anything to say about it, and I'm more than willing to accommodate. 
Alteration: after reading that boneless chicken breast might come out too dry with this recipe, I decided to follow someone else's example of frying the potatoes and boiling the chicken separately before combining them in the oven to brown. Also, I used cilantro, black pepper instead of white, and Old Bay Lemon & Herb seasoning. Works great!

This was good!  After it was in the oven, I remembered that I didn't like lemon chicken the last time I had it; but somehow this was better.  It may have been the white pepper, the olive oil, or a change in my taste buds.  The simplicity of this casserole cannot be beat!  My pastor and his wife liked it, too.  I couldn't give it five stars, though--my sister said it had too much lemon.

Good basic recipe; I made as written, but next time will add the cumin as others recommended. I did add a can of drained artichokes the last 10 minutes of cooking and it made a  nice 1  pan meal!

Excellent recipe I use it all the time now when I'm feeling dead tired but still want a good meal. Only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lemon overpowered it for my boyfriend and I. The lemon free version is excellent. 

I did throw in 21 spice "all spice" to add to the white pepper and salt and wow.. thanks for the tip audreyred

This is super easy to make (alhtough it takes a while to cook), light, and healthy.  I took others' advice and added extra garlic (2 cloves), cumin, and allspice (1 tsp. each) to the sauce.  Next time I'll cut up some onion and carrots (you could probably use any root vegetable) and add them to the chicken and potatoes.  I also did not peel the potatoes (the skin holds a lot of the nutrition) and I think this made the dish more flavorful and also kept the potatoes held together much better (they were a little crumbly), so I definitely recommend doing that.

This was just OK for me. I cut the lemon juice and olive oil in half and it was still very, very lemony. Almost overpowering lemon flavor. It was edible but I won't be making it again.

This was terribly bland even after adding 1/4 teaspoon each of oregano and thyme and marinating the dish all day. I only gave it 2 stars because the chicken was very juicy and tender after cooking.

This recipe turned out horrible. I followed all the directions and it was just too sweet! And the time for cooking was way off... We kept chicken/potatos in for an extra 15 min and it still wasn't cooked all the way afterwards. Oh well, this just isn't me and DH's style for taste!

This is absolutely fabulous. So easy. I did add just a little bit of oregano and thyme, but otherwise followed the recipe. I did it last minute, so I didn't marinate it at all and it was fantastic. My kids didn't complain, and my husband loved it. Thank you!

Made this tonight and it made my house smell delicious! I used half the lemon juice(strongly recommend only use 1/2 cup) and added a touch of cumin, doubled the garlic. It was so moist and delicious. It still was quite lemony, which I like. I uncovered the dish and broiled it so that the potatoes and chicken could get crispy and brown. The potatoes were very tasty! Thanks so much for sharing, it is a wonderful dish!

LOVE IT!!!  I made this a couple of weeks ago and my boyfriend and I bought loved it.  His dad is visiting this week and he asked me to make it again and his dad loved it too.  The best part is that it is super easy/simple to make.  I added carrots both times and used only 2 lemons.

I followed someone's advice to lightly fry the potatoes prior to baking. Then I added a dash of cumin and rosemary to the lemon sauce. Turned out tangy and delicious!

Very yummy!  I didn't have a big enough pan to cook the potatoes with the chicken so I did end up cooking them separately.  Loved the flavor this gave!  I did do extra garlic, as we love it, and this was perfect...thanks!

A quick and extremely tasty "one pot" family dinner, may require a bit longer than 30 minutes to brown, plus this makes more lemony sauce stick to the potatoes.

I found I didn't need they oil. Here is why. I used 8 chicken thighs, bone in added enough. I added about 3 or 4 chopped green onions, skipped the lemon juice (lazy) and backed it in a 9x13 inch pan.  Tonight I have 3 thighs left, but the potatoes were so good I ate them all, so I added a bit of smoked sausage, more potatoes, carrots, celery, a few radishes (taste like turnips when cooked) and near the end I'll add some chopped mushrooms.  As for the way I tried it the first time as close to the recipe as I could, it came out really good.

I thought overall it was pretty good.  I added mushrooms, a chopped onion, carrots and extra garlic and I didn't have much lemon juice on hand so I used only 1/4 cup I don't know if I would hae liked much more.  It was a little bland still when it was done, I added a little extra salt and some black pepper and then it was just about perfect!

this dish is great and simple, usually i add peeled and cut carrots, mushrooms, and i don't crush the garlic.  try adding 1/4 cup of Soya sauce, it adds a great taste and beautiful color....

Awesome, Awesome recipe!  Didn't change anything except that I ran out of lemon juice so only used 1/4 cup (just the stuff in the bottle since I didn't have any real lemons). It was perfect for my family including a hubby who is not too fond on tangy/lemony stuff and three kids ages 1, 4 and 6.  Tender, juicy chicken, delicious sauce, fork tender potatoes.  I also made homemade naan which totally enhanced this meal.  I have to say that I have also made this as written with 1 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice (NOT bottled) and have LOVED that was as well.  But then again I love tangy, lemony stuff, but my hubby didn't like the version with a full cup.   Going forward I will probably use 1/4 cup of the bottled juice which I think is always more concentrated in flavor anyways or 1/2 cup of the fresh squeezed to get a good lemon compromise for my family.  Either way this recipe is a winner in my book.

Absolutely delish!  I followed some of the recommendations from others, and marinated for 1 1/2 days.  Even my kids loved it.  Oh, and for someone who does not like to cook, I found this extremely easy.

very lemony, just the way Lebanese cooking is supposed to be. YUM! You should use chicken with skin as it dries out too much with skinless breasts. Will try with thighs next time. The potatoes were awesome.

The potatoes came out delicious; the chicken was OK.  I'll try this recipe again but will try marinating the chicken in the lemon juice mixture longer, and maybe adding a little bit of cumin.

This wasn't bad. I followed someone else's advice and broiled the last 5 minutes. I also sprinkled some parsley on top. It was a bit too lemony for my family's taste, so if I make it again I'll reduce the lemon juice and maybe substitute a little chicken stock.

This is a FINE recipe!  The lemon makes it so much more interesting than your average tasty stew.  Chicken and rosemary go very well together, but the combination of it all with onion and potato juices makes it to die for.  I promise you will not be able to stop picking at it.  Please don't refrigerate, as it take the tenderness away from the chicken.

LOVE this recipe.  I always add a little paprika, rosemary, and more white pepper... But it's a favorite.  We have it once a week!  We've tried it with bone in chicken and chicken breasts.... Both work, bone-in is a little more tender.  Enjoy!

I made this last night and was a little disappointed. I found it a little too lemony for my taste, and it didn't coat the chicken nor the potatoes very well. I added carrots to up the veggie factor. I might make this again if I could get the sauce to stick to the chciken and vegetables, otherwise it's not a keeper.

My Lebanese brother in law used to make this often..the only difference is he served it with a side of garlic mayo sauce to dip the food in and he sliced the potatoes instead of quartered..glad I found the recipe as my sister is no longer married to him!

the chicken was soooo juicy and tender with a crispy delicious skin and the potatoes were perfectly done
i substituted vinegar for the lemon juice and it was still great
probably one of the best chicken recipes i have ever made
i hardly ever give recipes 5 stars but i can't see any improvements needed on this one
i just made it for the second time and am still revelling in the yumminess of it all...mmm mmm

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  I agree with another reviewer that this is way better than the usual "cream of whatever soup" recipe.  I added cumin, allspice, and cilantro and I loved this.  Will add to my rotation.  Thanks a million.

We really liked the flavor but maybe a bit too much lemon for us. The second time I made it I used a little less and it turned out better for us.

Makes the chicken very tasty.  Would be good with potatoes I'm sure.  way too much lemon juice though-- cut back to 1/4 cup.
* Do not try with peas.  they soak up lemon juice flavor, ugh!
* works well with canned kidney beans.  
* plan to toss sauce.  otherwise use broiler to evaporate sauce.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed. I also added a small vidalia onion, chopped and a little curry powder. I cut the lemon juice by half. It was pretty good - although it seemed to lack something. I would probably use more garlic next time. It was very easy to prepare!

I used the advice others left and only used 1/2 c. of lemon juice.  And I used 2 pounds of skinless thighs.  During the last 10-15 minutes, I broiled it, occassionally basting it with the juices at the bottom of the pan.  My family LOVED it (though I thought it could have used more lemon juice and spice).  My 7 year old had 3 pieces, and my 4 year old said it was his best dinner ever.  Definitely a keeper.

This one didn't work too well for me.My potatoes came out tartly-sour too lemony.The chicken wasn't as flavorful as it should have been. I used to eat this at a lebanese restraurant before i moved out to the rural countryside.I had higher hopes for this recipe.

This was a hit in my family.  I would use fresh squeezed lemons and avoid bottled lemon juice. For me, this was 4 good sized lemons. A someone else said- a simple and pure dish. Very easy to prepare- will make again.

After reading all of the reviews I went for it all - adding to the olive oil, only half of the lemon juice, extra garlic, 1 tsp. each of cumin, allspice, Italian seasoning, also salt and pepper, probably 1/2 tsp of each. Poured it over the chicken, potatoes and a sliced onion in casserole dish. Let is soak for 15 mins. My husband and kids thought it was still too lemony and not enough spices! Next time I will make these adjustments, and prepare it much earlier to marinate (I read that leftovers were even better but we had none!) Served with steamed green beans.

Chicken and potatoes came out moist and delicious. The only thing is that it's way too much lemon. Next time I would only use half a cup!

It was just lemon, it seemed like nothing else had a flavor. I may make this again but I would cut way back on the lemon juice

This was very tasy and authentic. My husband's family apparently makes this with MUCH more lemon sauce so when I drained the broth out of the pan I slowly added it to the lemon mixture before pouring it back on the chicken.

I liked this a lot, so did my kids. The only additions I made where some oregano in the oil/lemon juice mixture and a sprinkle of paprika on the chicken pieces. I also used the broiler at the end to get a little more browning.

I had a friend who went back to Lebanon who, when living here, would make this dish. I thought I'd look up a recipe for it. This WOULD have fit the bill if I had stuck to the original recipe (hence the 5 stars). This dish NEEDS lots of lemon. I will make it again using all the lemon juice called for. And I think it needed quite a bit of salt and more garlic.

Me and my husband loved this one!  I followed the recipe to a T except I added some oregano, extra garlic, and 1 sweet onion minced.  However, next time I will have to be sure to get yellow potatoes as mentioned by others because I had to finish my potatoes in a pan because they were not finished.

I did not have bone-in chicken or all-spice. I cut the boneless breast in to 3/4" chunks and the potatoes (Russets) the same size. I ground some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger (about 1 tsp) and used 1 tsp of cumin. I also added some lemon zest with the juice. I did have so good olive oil. I was afraid of the baking time drying out the chicken, so I put it on a heavy grill pan and cooked it at 400 degrees on the outdoor grill. I had to turn the potatoes and chicken to get it to brown nicely on all sides.

This is just a great, easy, tasty recipe! I used chicken breasts only (all I had) and red potatoes (left skin on). Other than that, I followed the directions and it was great. The potatoes were so flavorful and the chicken was perfectly moist and delicious. It's good the next day, too. My whole family loved it.

The reason I am giving this two stars is because I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was too lemony for me, and my family. Also it needed some other flavorful seasoning. Take readers advice and cut lemon in half.

This was a wonderful recipes, so easy and tastey.  I loved how the chicken flavored the potatoes.  I liked it better with black pepper though because I am  not a fan of the flavor of white pepper. I think it is overpowering.  The lemon flavor was great though.  I have already made this two times and am making it again.  It is a new family favorite.

Good dish. Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the amount of lemon juice the recipe called for. Next time, I think I'll cut that in half. Still good though. Took other reviewers adivce and added a tsp of allspice and cumin, definitely recommend doing this, adds a TON of flavor.

This was average but not anything I'd make in the future without a lot changes.  It was VERY, VERY bland.  It had to cook longer than 60 minutes for the potatoes.  I added oregano and thyme...but still not a lot of flavor.  I was disappointed with this dish.

Very good dish...chicken was very tender and the potatoes were yummy.  I think that next time I may add some onion and use a little less lemon juice, although I used a little less than was called for already.  It had a very "lemony" taste!

I just made this for dinner and was very pleased.  I only had boneless breasts, so I cut those into smaller pieces.  I also halved the recipe and follow all the ingredients, except used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup lemon juice as well.  I thought the amount of lemon was just right.  It came out perfectly done and tender, with a great amount of cooking liquid from the lemon, oil and chicken.  I roasted asparagus in the same oven for the last 15 minutes and it all went well together.  My husband thought it was delicious and said to definitely make it again.

This was good... I adjusted the recipe because I had some veggies that I wanted to use up.  Added a little onion, zuccini and shroom.  Followed everything else to a T... used my mandoline to make thin potato slices.  My family liked this alot.  Very good the next day, too.

Yum! I used boneless skinless chicken tenders and removed them after the first 30 min. and kept them covered until the potatoes finished cooking.  They were juicy and lemony, the potatoes are delicious! I sprinkled on a bit of cumin and McCormick grinder italian seasoning.

This was a good base recipe. I would advise not using minced garlic because it will burn on the skin. Definately use the crushed. I added cumin and onion powder. Pretty good!

This is a new favorite weeknight dinner.  Quick and easy and delicious.  Based on another review I poached the chicken first in some chicken stock, and roasted the potatoes at the same time while the oven was preheating.  When the chicken was done, I threw it all together in the dish with the potatoes and put it in the oven until nice and golden.  It wasn't much longer to do the extra step with the chicken first, and it turned out great.  I did up the garlic like some others.  I have to say though it's funny that some said it needed more salt - the recipe calls for "salt to taste", and even says "season generously."  Not exactly the recipe's fault if it didn't have enough salt then...  5 stars for me!

I altered the marinade to make it more Lebanese in my experience and let the chicken marinade for a a day before making this dish. I added 1/2 c lemon juice, 4 cloves minced garlic, 2 tbls oil, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 ttsp paprika, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Dish was amazing, but next time will take off skin on chicken pieces - the flavor didn't get into the chicken itself much, but it tasted great! I served with a bag of Green Giant Steamers mixed vegetables for a roundabout meal. Good reviews, will make again.

Very, very good.  We used half the lemon juice, put in a whole head of garlic cloves and 1 tsp each cumin and coriander.

This recipe is so beautifully simple and wholesome.  I didn't have 4 cloves of garlic so I just used 2, used a lot of black pepper and didn't measure a thing.

My whole family loves this recipe, especially my husband who can be real picky, i do add the cumin like most recommend and a little more garlic , allspice and of course pepper and salt along with about a half of a cup of chicken broth to add just a bit more moisture to it and i also add a  few cans of green beans to the mix to bulk it up even more...this recipe is so cheap, easy and good.....its  a 5 star winner

Left off the potatoes, decreased the lemon, and used more garlic. The family almost cleaned me out and took home the leftovers, so that says it all. Very easy.

This was pretty good.  I do believe that the next time I make it I will do it a bit different.  Instead of using a cut up chicken I will use b/s chicken breast.  I also believe that I will let it marinate in the sauce a bit before I cook it.  It has a great flavor but it is not fair that only the skin really has any flavor.

This was easy to prepare and tasted okay.  I sprinkled some cumin over the potatoes and chicken and added extra garlic.  I probably won't make this again.

So simple and yummy!  I made the recipe using 1-2 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken breasts which I sliced into medallions sized peices.  Next time I will try this recipe with carrots.  It is very tangy but good.  My whole family approved of it.

I certainly thought this was easy to make and tasted fine just nothing special. I did use 8 piece cut up chicken, but cut the potatoes down to 4. I barely got that in my largest baking dish. I'm not sure I would make this again, but the lemon flavor was nice, but the hot oven really warmed my kitchen up so this would be no go for me in the summer (I could probably cook outside it gets so hot!) Thanks for sharing.

i should have read the reviews and used less lemon juice.  even though i enjoyed the tart taste, less lemon would have been nicer.  easy to prepare, tasted great.  my chicken was a little dry - maybe i chopped the pieces too small?  i will definitely make this again.

Not sure why all the good reviews. This was a waste of good chicken and potatoes. I made exactly as recipe written. Very bland. Definitely needs something. I had a good friend who was Lebanese and used to make this. I loved it. But this recipe fell short. Good thing I also made some yummy garlic sauce.

Nice dish, however I would  recommend to cook everything  before placing it in a baking dish otherwise it takes lots of time.  I also used only 1/2 cup of lemon juice  as well as 1/2 cup of olive oil and  added some water.  I added cumin,  7spices and little bit of oregano  and it turned out really  nice.

This was really good. My husband reluctantly eats chicken but said I can make this again anytime. I made it according to the recipe and used tiny yellow potatoes. I flipped the chicken after 30 minutes. I used my Pampered chef roasting pan with a lid and cooked it for 30 with lid on and 30 with lid off. My husband gave it an A plus on the chicken scale.

Cut ingredients by 1/4 (cooking for one), added a  sprinkle each of cumin, curry and tumeric plus a tad extra fresh lemon juice and this dish reminds me of my early years in Boston dinner invites by dear Lebonese neighbors.  Baked in a pyrex pie dish. 
Super easy prep with robust outcome.

This is a great easy way to cook chicken and potatoes. My husband and I felt that the lemon flavor was overpowering. I want to make it again but use half of the lemon juice and see if we like it better.

This was a super tasty, easy dish I made for my in-laws! I did make a couple of changes: first is I read a lot of reviews that said the dish was too lemony so I halved the lemon juice, second, I added about a table spoon of butter to help make up for the lack of lemon juice, third, I added cardamom and allspice to taste when adding salt and pepper, and fourth, I threw in some sweet cherry tomatoes for some variety. If you're on a time crunch you can do was I did: throw the potatoes in the microwave first, and thin slice your chicken. It was done in 30min instead of an hour. I will definitely make this again!

I found this rather bland. I won't make it again--was actually surprised it got so many rave reviews.

As other reviewers suggested I used half the lemon juice and added Herbes de Provence. Served with green salad and corn.
The whole family enjoyed it.

This one is a keeper. I used 2 pounds of chicken thighs, and 1/2 cup of lemon juice because that is what I had. But this recipe is amazing. The chicken is moist and tender with crispy skin!

Simple and GREAT meal.  Made a  Mediterranean  salads to complete it .  I added Cumin and Allspice ,  skinless chicken thighs and 1/2 lemon and 1/2 recommended oil.  All these changes worked very well.  No need to pan fry potatoes or pre cook chicken.  The juices from the chicken really enhance to flavor of potatoes.

It was not very flavorful and overpowered by  lemon. I mixed it up the second time and did as others did. Used skin on bone in chicken breast, added some spices, some onions and changed the balance of oil and acids. Came out much better.

My husband and I loved this meal so I would make it again. I followed a suggestion I read in the reviews and also used a teaspoon each of  "7 Spice" and cumin. I also used regular coarse black pepper and coarse sea salt. I used bone-in thighs with skin removed. I followed most of the cooking directions, but the potatoes were a little tough and the chicken was pale so I broiled it for 15 additional minutes at the end. I did also marinate the chicken and potatoes in the covered roasting pan for about an hour before baking.

Added carrot pieces to go with the potatoes, and doubled the garlic. Shook in some curry powder and red pepper flakes for extra zazz, and served with garlic bread.

Fragrant, flexible dish. My roommate is half Lebanese and this is similar to how her mom taught her to make this.

I found this advice on making this dish that seems helpful: If you don’t have a mortar and pestle to smash the garlic, oil, salt, and lemon juice into a sauce, you can use a food processor or blender. Freshly squeezed lemon juice makes a big difference in flavor.  Cook the chicken and potatoes first and drain any liquid given off by the chicken before adding the sauce. After adding the sauce, broil the dish. Add traditional Lebanese spices/herbs such as thyme, cumin or sumac to taste.

It was to lemony, next time Im cutting the lemon in half
I used canola oil instead of olive oil so I think If I use olive oil will be a difference.
Added some oregano and cumin. Served with broccoli :)

I only gave it a 4 star because I didn't have chicken next to it and only baked the potatoes, but definitely make again.  I added lots of herbs and fresh garlic.

I do agree, to marinte this a bit or cook chicken meat side down during first 30 min and then turn when taking foil off to get lemon infused in chicken.  It was delicious as was however.

This was a good dish, I did add some onion. The lemon juice was overwhelming, will probably use less the next time I make it. I served it over white rice and salad.

I had to make this for my daughter cultural celebration.  She had to find a Lebanese recipe. This is soooo good! thank you for posting this.
