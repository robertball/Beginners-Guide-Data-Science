This came out really well.  I prefer a bit more spice, so I doubled the chili powder and the sugar, and added a good amount of fresh ground black pepper.  As I did not have cloves, I added a sprinkling of cinnamon.  And to make it a bit healthier I substituted lean ground turkey for the ground beef, and used brown rice instead of white.  I would definately make this again.

This was a great start for me.  To the browned ground beef I added some chopped up green pepper and mushrooms.  With the sauce I used two cans of tomato sauce, extra garlic, chili powder and black pepper.  Then I also added heavy cream, Tabasco, cayenne pepper and thyme.  Yum-O!!!!!!!

This was exceptionally good. The spices were wonderful. I would make extra "sauce" next time, and when the peppers are done I would cut them in half and spoon the sauce over the top of the stuffed pepper.

This came out so well!! I used red peppers instead of green and the juices from the red peppers were so sweet and amazing.  I substituted equal for sugar.  I also added green olives and olive juice to the sauce for more flavor.  I used fresh crushed tomatoes instead of canned, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, and brown rice instead of white.  I minced mushrooms in the sauce as well. I also added a cajun seasoning to the sauce.  This recipe was amazing!! Thank you!!

This is the definitive stuffed pepper recipe in my mind. When I've had stuffed peppers at restaurants, they usually taste something like this recipe, which is to say, "spectacular."  I had some leftover feta cheese which I sprinkled over the tops of the peppers for the last ten minutes of baking, a superb garnish. I had plenty of leftover sauce, which I will use for something else somewhere down the road.

My family enjoyed this. I stuck to the recipe, but added a bit more crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce because of other reviewers' comments that there wasn't enough sauce. There was just the right amount of chili powder and ground cloves; they weren't overpowering. I topped the peppers with some additional grated Parm before serving. Tip: if using converted rice (eg. Uncle Ben's Â®), you'll need to start with just under 1/2 cup of uncooked rice. Cook the rice while you're preparing the sauce, then set aside to cool.

Very time-consuming, but very good.  I agree with making more sauce; I had just enough to cover five small peppers, but had another plate of the filling!  Will work on portions, but excellent dish!

The chili flavoring overtook the rest of the ingredients. Next time I'll use less. I wanted more tomato taste to it. Also the green peppers didn't soften in the micro at 45 seconds, this needs to be adjusted to your own microwave.

I found the chili powder did overpower the taste of the sauce, and the stuffing was bland. I also parboilded the green peppers because heating them in the microwave did not work well. My husband enjoyed it, however. I will continue my search for a good stuffed pepper recipe.

I wasn't a huge fan of this one but my husband and son couldn't get enough.  I think the meat filling needed a bit more flavor but the tomato Creole sauce is absolutely delicious.

The peppers needed to be cooked longer, but other than that they were terrific.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I substituted ground turkey (seasoned with Cajun seasoning) for the beef and brown rice for the white - it was wonderful.  Will use the whole 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes next time.

Great use for all those fresh peppers that I didn't know what to do with. The cloves added a depth of flavor.  Used tomotoes for chili and omitted chili powder because it is what I had.

The filling was amazing! Unfortunately 4 out of 5 consumers in my house don't like peppers themselves. Not a fault of the recipe, a fault on the cook who decided to make stuffed PEPPERS. But everyone loved the beefy filling. I used 2 red, 2 orange and 2 yellow peppers and boiled them for 5 minutes before hand instead of microwaving them. I went a little astray on the 'Creole' part of the recipe. I was going for more Italian, but I chose this recipe for the method and proportions more than the actual ingredients. So I did change things up a bit. I omitted the chili powder, sugar, clove and bay leaf. I used a 15 oz. can of Progresso's Roasted Tomato recipe starter instead of plain tomato sauce. I browned the beef, added the onion and fried until translucent, added precooked minute rice, crushed tomatoes, (w/ the juice) garlic and 1/2 cup of water. I put some Italian seasoning and spices in the recipe starter, with salt and pepper and added about a 1/2 cup to the beef mixture. I stuffed the peppers and this was enough to fill them pretty full. Then I spooned the Starter sauce over the tops and had some left over. I baked them in the oven for 20 minutes. Mixed about a 1/2 a cup of sour cream w/ ranch seasoning into the recipe starter sauce spooned that over the top of the peppers then added shredded cheese on top and baked for 5 minutes more. Then I plated the peppers cut them in half and spooned the rest of the sauce over them. They were AMAZING!!!

These were good.  Not my best dinner though.  I guess I was hoping for something a little more saucy and sloppy.  The sauce firmed up on top and they were a tad dry.  Some tweaking may help.  Could have creoled em up a little more with a little Tony's, but overall a good flavor... Oh, also, the peppers really need to be cooked before stuffing, and 45 seconds was not enough.  I microwaved them for about 2 minutes and cooked them in the oven for about 45 minutes.  The longer they cook, the better the flavor.

Fantastic twist on stuffed peppers! I opted to substitute cayenne pepper for the chili powder. I think if I were to make it again, I'd do 1/2 tsp cayenne; it kind of overpowered the rest.

Very tasty! I used orange peppers because that's what I had on hand & we are not big fans of green peppers.  I used ground sirloin & a little more rice than I should have & it was a bit on the dry side, but that was my fault.  We had leftovers so I removed the stuffing, added a can of diced tomatoes & seasoned with original seasonings.  I diced the pepper shells & added to the filling.  I simmered the mixture until heated through.  I then used this mixture over pasta for another meal.  :)  *We like it spicy so I did as others did & upped the chili powder.  Yum

These were a nice change from the usual stuffed pepper. The peppers were very tasty  but instead of 'Creole' I got more of a 'taste of India'. BUT being vegetarian, I had substituted the ground beef for a TVP. I had fresh tomatoes on hand, so I chopped them up and used them instead of canned.  Next time I will lighten up on the cloves  and augment the chili powder.  The cloves overly dominated, but if I had used real beef this might not have happened.
