This has potential but needs some tweaking. With 2 green bells and 10 green chile peppers everything else pretty much gets lost. The quinoa most definitely needs doubled if not tripled for starters. I recommend doubling the carrots and celery too. The chickpeas are few and far between but considering they are not my favorite that was good for me. Double those too if you love them. This soup was okay but as written it was just okay.
