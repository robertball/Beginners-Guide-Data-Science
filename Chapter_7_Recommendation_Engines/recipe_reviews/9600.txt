This was amazing!  I followed the advice of others by adding more rhubarb.  I used just over 2 1/2 cups, and I'm glad I did.  With adding this extra rhubarb, it does need to cook for at least 40-45 minutes.  I know some people cautioned to check it earlier than the directions.  I was amazed at how tender the rhubarb was considering that it was raw when it went in the oven.  I did make a few alterations.  I used light sour cream, I cut back the brown sugar by 1/4 of a cup, and for the topping, I used half the sugar, and used Sweet'n Low for the other half.  Five stars!

These bars are very tasty. Be warned: when you are reading the printed recipe it can be confusing; the list of ingredients read from left to right (that's how you read it to coincide with the steps). The only change I made was I whirled frozen rhubarb in my food processor because I just don't like stringy foods and they turned out wonderful. They were cake-like and golden brown. Absolutely perfect with a cup of coffee or tea on this very damp, chilly, rainy day. Also, your house will smell marvelous while these bake! Enjoy.

These were very good but I would like to have had a little more rhubarb in the bars.  Several of my bites had no rhubarb in them in the squares I ate.

I made this with half whole-wheat flour, and non-fat sour cream. It turned out great! Better the second day -- the rhubarb moisture disperses into the cake, as does the flavor. More rhubarb, up to 2 1/2 cups, is an improvement. I found that it baked 5-10 minutes faster; that might be the explanation for the baker who found it dry.  A definite keeper for rhubarb season! I'm going to try freezing it, and I'm going to try it with double the topping as suggested above.

I made these bars for a large public gathering and they were a hit. I did use plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I would also try these bars with other fresh fruit in season. Yummy!

Good and easy.  Maybe it's a minor point but it is a lot easier when the ingredients are listed in order.  The sugar, melted butter (which doesn't say to melt it in the list of ingredients), nuts and cinnamon should be listed first - or at least be together in the list.  It just makes it easier than to search the list when they're out of order.

I thought that these would be like lemon bars or raspberry bars, but they are actually much more like a coffee cake.  These were so moist and had the perfect amount of topping (although when I was making it, I thought that it seemed like a lot).  I personally think that next time I will double the rhubarb.  You could hardly taste it in the original recipe.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Very good, but I agree with the other reviewers that it doesn't call for enough rhubarb. I used 2 1/2 cups, turned the oven down to 325, and added 30 minutes of baking time. It came out just right. Delicious.

This was a great recipe! The cake turned out to be very moist, and was just the right balance of tart and sweet. I also put a little over 2 cups of rhubarb in, but made no other changes. I do think that the directions and ingredients list should probably be edited so that they are a little bit clearer—they made sense after I read them through a few times, but I can see how they could be confusing. Thanks for the recipe—I know that I will be making this one again!

I used 3 cups of chopped rhubarb as other suggested, it was exactly the right amount.  It was done perfectly in 45 minutes.  I served it at a duplicate bridge game and it disappeared in no time.  I received several requests for the recipe and many raves.  I did have staining in my coated metal pan where the rhubarb touched the bottom and sides.  I've made a note to try a glass pan next time.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!!!

I made the recipe exactly as written but only needed to bake it 40 minutes in a glass pan.  Loved it, thought it was very moist and a great way to use rhubarb.  The next time I make it though, I will double the amount of rhubarb as some reviewers suggested. I did think the directions were a little confusing at first..try reading side to side instead of down after printing. The recipe is a keeper.

This was excellent.  I used the extra rhubarb and since I didn't have any shortening, I substituted apple sauce.  It made the squares really moist.  Next time I will try a few more walnuts and possibly add a small amount of coconut.  My rhubarb was from the freezer and I thought it worked well.

Very YUMMY!  The only thing I did different is that I doubled the crumb topping for the top and used a little over 2 cups of rhubarb.  I found that is didn't need to bake as long as the recipe said.  I only baked for 40 minutes.  Turned out very moist and yummy!!!

Really creative way to use rhubarb.  Reminds me of a combination between apple crisp and coffee cake.  Would be nice with a powdered sugar drizzle.  Thanks for this post!

I just got done making these.  I took suggestions from other reviews - substituted the walnuts with oatmeal, shortening with applesauce and replaced the sour cream with one cup cherry yogurt and one tbsp baking soda (realized I was out of sour cream!).  It was very good - I don't think my family would have noticed the changes if I hadn't said something.

I have been looking for a recipe for these bars every since I lost my previous one from a newspaper article.  The one thing that I changed was I used Macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.  They seem to compliment the rhubarbs tartness.

This is excellent.  I did double the rhubarb as suggested by other reviewers and it came out very moist, tender and flavorful.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I only cooked it for 40 minutes also.  Thank you for a grrrreat recipe.

I absolutely loved these - they were so  moist and fluffy all at the same time.  And they weren't too sweet, nor were they too tangy.  I used almonds instead of walnuts though as they were all I had on hand and they still turned out awesome.

I have a lot of great rhubarb recipes but this one will not be added to my file.  I found it extremely dry and tasteless. I couldn't even taste the rhubarb. Probably needed another egg, some oil and a lot more rhubarb.

I wish I had added more rhubarb- (I put in about 2 cups) since that was the taste I was craving.  However a good coffee cake as it was.

This recipe is very moist and has good flavor. It lacked the rhubarb taste I was looking for. I would make it again but I would add more rhubarb and I would mince the walnuts so they could be in every bite

I have made this recipe a few times and it is always delicious.  Tonight I served it like cake with ice cream on top (rather then cutting into squares).  I used oatmeal as a topping instead of walnuts in order to make them nut-free.  This one is always a crowd-pleaser!

This recipe is fantastic! I did add 2 1/2 c. of rhubarb as many suggested and it was great! Almost like a coffee cake, great for the morning with a pot of coffee!

This is definitely more a cake than a bar. I made it with the 3 cups of rhubarb, 1/2 strawberries for color, and I added a small egg...batter felt dry. VERY good choice. Will make it again!!

Good ! Very cake like. I would add more rhubarb next time i make it the 1 1/2 cup of rhubarb is just not enough. I would bump it  up to 3 cups.

Amazing... like others I used yogurt instead of sour cream, and increased the rhubarb to 2 1/2 cups. Absolutely fantastic. Great as a dessert, and the leftovers are excellent for breakfast!

Definitely more of a coffee cake.  Especially since the topping barely covered the top so I doubled it. I put in 2 cups of rhubarb and next time will do 3+ because I'd like it a little more tart/some rhubarb with each bite.  But very good recipe despite the jumbled directions.

This was a great recipe. I used butter for the shortening and made up the lack of sour cream with some plain yogurt. So moist and yummy. Thanks for submitting it.

My family enjoyed this very much.  I doubled the rhubarb and also added a couple of ripe bananas which made it extremely moist.  I think the bananas toned down the rhubarb flavor and ended up being very tasty!

Awesome recipe.  It's confusing following the directions at first but once you figure it out, you'll have a delicious desert!  A great way to use your rhubarb.  Delicious and I'll recommend it to everyone.

I made this in an 8x8 pan and it came out very cake-like.  It tasted much better the 2nd day - I didn't really care for it fresh out of the oven.  But it was very moist and I was pleasantly surprised when I had some for breakfast the morning after I made it.  It came out a lot like a coffee cake.

Rhubarb increased to 2 1/2 cups.
Heaping portion of walnuts, didn't level.
Baked fine at 56 minutes.
Moist. Easy to cut hot with spatula. Great crumble.
Would consider even more rhubarb.

Delicious! Only change I made was I used a 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening; because I didn’t have any. It was a nice, new way to use my rhubarb! Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 4 stars, but after altering it a bit I would give it 5 stars.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the rhubarb to 3 cups, chopped small. I also added an extra egg and a teaspoon of vanilla, since the batter seemed a bit bland. I also altered the topping, adding an extra Tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup flour to make it more crumbly like a coffeecake.  Baked 40 minutes.  It was absolutely delish! I agree with other reviewers, having the ingredients in order in the recipe would help it be less confusing to make.

We really enjoyed this moist, flavorful "coffee cake."  As previously noted, this needs more rhubarb; I added about 2 1/2 cups and think it could even use another 1/2 c. or so.  I didn't have to change the cooking temp. or time; it was done right at 45 min.  I came up with a great variation idea sort of by accident:  since I was out of walnuts/pecans, I decided to try shredded, sweetened coconut in the topping instead.  We loved how it turned out!  Who knew that coconut could go so well with rhubarb?!

Get these away from me!  They're delicious.  I made them as is - didn't double the rhubarb - just made sure to spread it in the pan so that each bite had rhubarb - and it was really good.  The topping was a bit dry - not sure what I did but probably could've upped the butter.  You don't need to peel rhubarb - the stringiness melts away as it's cooked.  I cut mine into about 1/3 inch slices.

This was easy to make but turned out a bit mushy on the bottom, even after 50 minutes.  I think I would have to bake for even longer but I will try again.

This was very well recieved at a party.  I felt this is very much a cake recipe.  I liked the topping very much.  I think it could use a little more rhubarb added.  Overall, very nice served as a dessert with whipped cream, or at breakfast.

This recipes yields a lovely, slightly sweet rhubarb cake. I have also made "Rhubarb Cake I" from this website. That recipes uses buttermilk and I like the texture and flavor using sour cream. My family preferred this one. I served it with strawberry ice cream. Super good as a brunch or desert
cake.

Definately a coffee cake instead of squares and definately needs more rhubarb but very nummy!  My husband says definately a keeper!  The only thing I did do differently is to remove the "skin" from the rhubarb.  I didnt know that you needed to do that but my hubbie said your suppose too. I dont know but did and it was awesome!!

Very moist and very tasty! It's like a short coffee cake. I used part sour cream and part yogurt, because I didn't have enough sour cream. I didn't give it 5 stars because more rhubarb would be better, as others have stated. Will definitely make again. We enjoyed it cooled about 2 hours out of the oven. No idea if it will be better the second day: I was going to send the leftovers to work with my husband tomorrow, but there won't be any!

This was rather disappointing the first night but did taste better the next day.  I put in a little more rhubarb and I'm glad I did.  It felt like something was missing.

mmmm...this was delicious. I made it twice with different, but equally good results. the first time i made it, i followed the recipe fairly close, but used a combo of yogurt and mayonnaise instead of the s. cream because i had none. I also added about twice the topping. this was very good, verrrry moist, and some of the topping dropped to the bottom and made a caramelly stuff. mmmm. the second time, i added about 1/2 c. extra flour and less mayo. This was more like a traditional coffee cake - very good also.
