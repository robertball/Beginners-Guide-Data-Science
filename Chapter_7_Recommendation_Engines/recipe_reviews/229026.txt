With a little butter melted into a cut muffin, these are a good start to the day.  I do think they could have used a little of something in them, like vanilla and maybe some ginger.  I think the author of the recipe is onto a really good start to a great muffin!  Thanks for my breakfast today!

I love it when I make a muffin recipe and it's a muffin, not a cupcake.  Just as any drink served in a martini glass seems to be called a martini nowadays, it also seems any cake recipe baked in a cupcake liner and left unfrosted is called a muffin.  Not.  The mixing method is different, the flour to fat ratio is different, and a muffin has very little sugar (as opposed to cakes, where the flour and sugar ratio is nearly equal).   This is a muffin, and I appreciated that.  I added two cups of chopped rhubarb, not because this basic muffin needed it, but because I'm looking for excuses to use it.  I also sprinkled them with some demerera (turbinado) sugar just to dress them up.  These are moist, rather "bland," as true muffins are supposed to be (do we think of biscuits as bland?), the taste of the oatmeal apparent.  Just the right level of sweetness - remember, this is a muffin, not cake!  When I mixed up the batter I did use a heaping cup of sugar but only to adjust for the tartness of the rhubarb.  While these would be delicious spread with a little butter, honey or jam, they were quite satisfying just as is.

I think this is an awesome recipe. Maybe instant oatmeal banana, stawberry, or maple brown sugar, apples/cinnamon.

These are my favorite muffins! Think cornbread type of muffin but made with oatmeal instead and you will appreciate what these are.  They are light, fluffy, wholesome oaty muffins with a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar that go well with foods you would normally serve with cornbread (chili, stew, roasts). I however love a muffin that isn't loaded with sugar or filled with fruit and found these to be delicious warm with just a pat of butter. I use regular rolled oats and sub 1 c. of white whole wheat flour for regular flour and use melted coconut oil instead of butter, I even leave out the cinnamon and salt. Wonderful!

Instead of vanilla, I added almond extract, which was delicious. I also added a little bit of brown sugar on the tops before baking, and they carmalized nicely. Terrific!

I halved this recipe but used the full 1/2 cup of butter; it was perfect.  I didn't need to spread the cut muffin with more butter and they were wonderfully moist.  I've made them without additions and they are wonderful.  In one batch I added 1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans, 1/3 cup of chopped dates and 1/3 cup of raisins that had been soaked in hot water for 10 minutes; those were really great.  This is the perfect breakfast muffin recipe as it's not too sweet.

I used old-fashioned oats and increased the buttermilk to 2 1/2 cups since they tend to soak up more liquid than the quick.  I also doubled the cinnamon, but that's just because I am a cinnamon addict.  They were really good and even my teen daughter liked them!

This recipe is almost identical to one that was on this site a few years ago. The only difference is that that one called for vegetable oil instead of melted butter. I have never tried these muffins with the melted butter, but as I make them (with the oil), they are very good. (I may try them with half butter-in baking butter adds flavor, but oil adds more moisture since the water in butter evaporates during the baking process.) These bake up nice and high with a perfectly rounded top, which is crisp while the interior is moist. They are just sweet enough, and adaptable if one would prefer any spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg (as I used). In mine I also added a little vanilla. My youngest daughter rarely likes muffins, but she thought these were good-making them a winner for me:)

I cut this recipe in half. I do not keep buttermilk on hand, I had to use milk "soured" with lemon juice. I chose not to halve the cinnamon and I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I did not get 12 muffins out of a halved recipe, I did get nine that were a little on the big size. Baked at 350, they were done at 20 minutes. Not a bad muffin, the vanilla helped and I'm glad I kept the cinnamon at it's original measurement. Best warm with butter--the amount of sweetness is perfect.

Great base oatmeal muffin.

I add in a handful of chocolate chips, raisins and/or chopped nuts, whatever I have available!

I cut the recipe in half in case we don’t like it..  I made a few changes, to hopefully make them a bit healthier. I mixed powdered buttermilk with 2% milk. I used a full teaspoon of cinnamon, added 1/3 c of honey. I added 1/2 c chia seeds, which quickly became 1 cup after hydrated for a few minutes. They couldn’t have turned out more perfect. My daughter, who is brutally honest and doesn’t like oatmeal muffins (says they are always dry!), loved them! IMHO, the honey did not make them too sweet. Going to use this as my base oatmeal muffin recipe. I can see several possibilities!

These were great!  Based on the other reviews of needing a little something extra I did add an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar and and extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt and they came out beautifully!  I’ll definitely be adding this one to my fave list. Thanks for the recipe.

These are a little too bland for my taste. I think they would be much better if I had added some type of Jam to give it a more fruity flavor. The texture is good and the recipe is quite simple.

I actually really like these a lot. You get the primary flavors of oatmeal and buttermilk, without a lot of other things detracting from that. While these would definitely be a good base for adding in other ingredients or flavorings, they are really good on their own. They aren't overpowering, overly sweet, or overly spiced. I personally like that about them. I would definitely make these again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

Don't over bake. I make jumbo muffins and freeze.  
I add a little more cinnamon, a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg.  I usually add raisins but  dried cherries  (Trader Joes) were amazing.

Well, these are in the oven now, so I'll let you know in a few minutes!  Can't wait.
I didn't have much milk or buttermilk, so I improvised.
I also halved the recipe since I was low on staples.
This is what I did! 
1/4 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup almond milk (I used sweetened)
1 cup oats
soaked for 15 min per instructions

1/4 cup melted butter (put in oven to melt while I finished measuring.)
1 beaten egg
1/2 cup sugar (out of brown so used white)
Note-don't let butter get hot or you'll have cooked egg.  Added butter slowly, it was warm but not hot.

I added that to oats after combining.  It seemed a bit thick and hard to mix.

1 cup flour
1 t. baking powder
1/2 t. baking soda
1/2 t. pink sea salt

I soaked about 1/4 c dried cranberries in warm water for 10 min.
Since the mixture seemed a bit dry,  the extra water in the dried cranberries seemed to help.
Added 1 grated carrot and a few pecans I had on hand.
This yielded 14 muffins.  I know I changed this up, but wanted to use what I had!  And I love carrots.

OK - update on taste and texture ~ then I will rate them.

I hear the timer!  yay!

These turned out tasty and moist with just the right sweetness!  Delish!  And somewhat healthy.  I give them 5 stars!

I am about to make these for the second time, and this time around, because it's fall and my daughter has a cold, I am going to add some dried cranberries and pecans. They are a very good breakfast muffin and she loved them first time just with some warm milk.

Skeptical because I do like a sweeter muffin and found the oatmeal recipes I've tried in the past too bland, but needed to use leftover buttermilk.  Took reviewers advice on additions and used 1 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice instead of cinnamon and also 1 tsp vanilla.  Also added fresh blueberries and sprinkled cinnamon on the top before baking.  The batter is thick didn't want to stir too much anyway, so folded in about 1 cup of berries very gently, then sprinkled a few in the bottom of each paper muffin cup before spooning in the batter.  YUM! Very, very happy with the moist, sweet result.

These muffins are a breeze to make.  They have just the right amount of sugar and a great chewy texture.  They are the tiniest bit crumbly, but we make them several times a month they are so good!

The texture was spot on! I'm sure this is what the author intended, a very basic muffin using oatmeal and buttermilk as base, but yet so versatile to the flavoring/toppings that you can add, I did orange almond cinnamon for my first try, and it was good!

It was so easy to put together. I halved the recipe easily and it was done within 45 minutes (including 30 minutes oven preheating time)!

This is so good! I took all the recipe, and changed only three things; 1.) only read the instruction after I put it in oven at 180deg so obviously I didnt follow all steps including temp. 2.) changed the buttermilk to yoghurt. 3.) used atta flour instead of the AP flour to make it fiber rich. 
I experimented with every batch by mixing Chocolote rice, Orange and Ginger, Bacond and Cheese, Strawberry Jam - they all turned out DELISH! my husband loved it and Im a happy girl. I will save this for my future generation.
Thank you!

Good muffin recipe, and not too sweet as mentioned by other reviewers. I had about 2/3 cup of fresh red raspberries left and mixed them in at the end and sprinkled with flax seeds. Could easily have used a full cup of raspberries. Great way to use leftover buttermilk.

A nice breakfast muffin that is not too sweet.  It was very moist due to the buttermilk and that created a nice texture.  I made one pan with jelly added to the middle of the muffin.  I needed to use up a small portion of jelly and it worked really well in this recipe.  The muffins froze and defrosted nicely.  That is always a plus in my book when making a recipe.

I loved this recipe with a few changes... thanks everyone for your comments, they really helped!  I added a little more cinnamon, a little ginger (about 1/2 a tsp) a dash of nutmeg, and about 2 tsp vanilla.   I topped these with a mix of brown sugar and sweetened coconut and they were terrific!

I love this recipe. On its own, it is perfectly sweet, and it is basic enough for thousands of variations. I am thinking of making a savoury version with ham and cheese next!

I agree with other reviewers...this is a great base muffin.  I also made several changes.  I added 1/4 c. ground flax seed; 1 T. vanilla, 1 T. cinnamon; used 1 c. raw honey instead of the brown sugar; added approx. 1/4 c. all purpose flour due to the extra liquid from the honey.  I used 2 c. soft wheat flour instead of the all purpose; I added 1 c. sweetened coconut.  My husband is not a chocolate chip muffin fan so I made 12 muffins plain and then added 1/2 mini chocolate chips to the remaining batter.  I actually made 30 regular-sized muffins.  I love how you can take something basic and make it your own for your family to enjoy!!!  I rated the recipe based on my additions.  I'm also going to try soaking the oatmeal overnight the next time I make them.

Good muffin but I exchanged 1 cup of white flour with 1 cup of wheat flour and added 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 teaspoon of cinnamon; and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Added taste with out adding extra calories.

A good, basic oat muffin - our girls (ages 4 and 9 y/o) loved them!  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and measured into muffin tins with 1/3 c. measuring cup - which made 14 large (but not overflowing) muffins.

These are delicious and easy to make! Took about 1 hr from start to finish. My daycare kids love them and so do I, especially warmed and served with a glass of cold milk. Hearty, healthy, and a bit chewy from the oats. I made 48 mini muffins and 8 regular muffins. I’ve made these several times and prefer to spray the pans, because the muffins tend to crumble a little after pulling off a paper liner. Whole wheat flour is great in these too!

I've never commented on a recipe before lol... but I really wanted to say how much I appreciate this recipe!! Wanted a reliable recipe for a fast breakfast and this should be perfect.
This is a fantastic base recipe. I added a couple things:
- I knew it wouldn't be "spiced" enough for my taste so I used a little more cinnamon, plus a teaspoon of ginger, almost a teaspoon of nutmeg, and a half-teaspoon of cloves.
- I substituted some of the flour for buckwheat flour (cause I'm crazy about the nutty taste of buckwheat).
(Also I used oil instead of butter.)
Came out amazing.
Next time I will probably try adding some grated apple, or maybe dried cranberries.

I changed this a little too make it a little more healthy. I only used 1/2 cup sugar, then I add 1-3 ripe bananas, an extra tsp of Cinnamon, a little vanilla, and a cup of raisins. I also omit the baking soda completely and just rely on the 2 tsp of baking powder. I think that might be why some think these are bland, too much baking soda, bleh! We love my healthier, tastier version though!

This recipe was great! Except, I left out the brown sugar, only used stiff egg whites (no yolk, have an allergy) and added a lid and a half of vanilla extract and a little extra cinnamon.  These muffins came out perfect! I’ll definitely be making them again in the future!

I’ll make these again because I love the texture, but I’ll be tweaking next time. I added 2 cups of frozen saskatoon berries, but even with the fruit, they were kind of bland. I think I’ll replace the butter with applesauce next time, not to cut down the fat, but more to lend a bit more sweetness and depth. I like them the way they are, but the kids weren’t interested. I’d also cut back the salt— it was too much with the tang of the buttermilk.

I made this gluten and dairy free with the following changes, and it was *exactly* what I was looking for as a duplicate of a Tim Horton's muffin I used to occasionally get about 10 years ago.  I subbed the buttermilk for almond milk, made with water and almond butter, the butter for Earth Balance vegan margarine and a bit of coconut oil, the flour for Bob's 1-to-1 plus added a little sorghum flour to stiffen the dough a bit, although it may not have needed it.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of xantham gum.  In addition I added about 2 cups total of a mixture of diced apples, dried cranberries, raisins, walnuts and dates.  On top I sprinkle crushed walnuts and brown sugar upon removing from the oven.  They didn't rise much, so I did fill them to the top of the liner and it did make 24 muffins.

I used 2 c. steel cut oats, soaked overnight, with whey added (from yogurt I had just made). It was too runny so I added a cup of regular oats. The first batch was good but for the next panful, I wanted them to be sweeter, so I added butterscotch chips and they sure are sweet - definitely a dessert! The steel cut oat texture is more work to chew but I got them on a great sale and wanted to try it. Also, I was low on butter so I used 1/2 c. oil instead. The normal recipe is great too, as I've made it that way for years.

These were very good!  I used several of the previous hints:  I used half coconut oil and half applesauce,  1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. apple pie spice, 1/4 c. chopped pecans, and 1/4 cup dried cranberries.  I also think I should have soaked the cranberries before using.  I made a whole recipe and had 24 moderately sized muffins, but like the idea that this recipe is easily cut in half.    I look forward to trying other variations to the recipe and definitely plan to make again.  Thanks for a "real" great muffin recipe!!!

First time i made these with some apple sauce and nutmeg added. Second time I added maple extract, nutmeg and a bit of white sugar, a few tbsp sour cream and 1/4c apple sauce.  My kids prefer muffins a bit sweeter than this recipe. Have tried chocolate chip as well. A good base recipe with good texture to tweak to your tastes. This recipe yields 4 dozen mini muffins baked for 10 mins.

Great tasting basic recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of allspice and used coconut sugar instead of brown.  Also used 1/3 cup margarine and topped up to the 1/2 with applesauce. Made 16 muffins. They were moist overall but the oatmeal added a lovely almost nutty crunch. Overall a pretty healthy muffin with the added fibre. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe was ok but not exceptional. It lacked flavour and should have been more moist.

They're a hit in my house! I however didn't have buttermilk on hand and used sour milk but still so good! My picky 6 year old even loves them.  I will be making them again! A nice simple base too to add fruit or chocolate to.

This muffin (to me) is NOT bland......it is delicious! Chewy.  Slight changes only.  I used 1 cup quick cooking oats and 1 cup of old fashioned oats which, gave nutty like taste and a nice texture.  1 tsp. Vanilla paste & 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice replacing the cinnamon.  The nutmeg in the spice oddly enough--is what pushed it over the top! Lovely.  Baked for 15 minutes in my oven.  Decent crown.  

I don't know how you get 24 muffins though, unless you 'short' some of the cups and I mean--drastically.  Then again, (once fully baked) I like my muffins to rise 'right at' or preferably 'past' ...the paper rim.  I don't like 'sickly' looking muffins aka half-filled when in liners....lol.  However, if your not using liners, you CAN get 24.  Then again it tcould have been the Old-Fashioned Oats because the 'oat' is larger than the 'quick-cooking' oat.  
Larger oat, absorbed more liquid....you know....yadda...yadda boom.  Ahhhhhh....food science.
Using liners though, I got 22 'full' standard size muffins.  Dusted with 'icing' sugar once cooled and left some plain.  Not a fancy muffin but hey....a dang...good one!!!

Such a easy recipe.  I dumped all ingredients into he bowl of my stand mixer, let it sit for 15 minutes, blended on low with the beater attachment just until moist.  I cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white.  Also added a little allspice as well as cinnamon.  Sprinkle a little powder sugar over the top for decoration.

These were delicious! As previous reviewers recommended, used a tsp of vanilla and added extra spice - a 1/2 tsp or so pumpkin pie spice. Also subbed 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  Smeared some Philly black cherry cream cheese on  one and it was yummy

With a few modifications I was able to cut some fat and add extra flavour and protine. I substitute the 1/2 cup of oil for 1/2 cup of apple sauce, added 3 bananas, 4 scoops of chocolate protine powder and reduced sugar by 1/3 cup. They came out moist and amazing. Great base recipe !

I halved this recipe and used a large size (3 tbsp) OXO cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups- one heaping scoop for each. It made 10 perfect sized muffins. I used old fashioned rolled oats and the batter needed a little extra splash of milk for moisture. I left the original 1 tsp of cinnamon and also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 2 tsp vanilla. I sprinkled the tops of the muffins with shredded coconut before baking at 375F for 16 minutes. This recipe bakes up fluffy, moist and delightfully crumbly. Good base for many fun additions!

A very good, simple recipe that you can make in 20 minutes or less. Not too sweet, great for breakfast. I used 1/2 c. yogurt and two teaspoons of vinegar and milk in stead of buttermilk. I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick. I also added 1/2 c. raisins and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. While the oatmeal and milk mixture was soaking I mixed up the rest of the ingredients. They baked in my convection oven of 390 F for 16 minutes. Delicious!

SO EASY!!  I made these for the first time, and they are awesome! I used regular oats because that's what I had, but they turned out fine. I added chopped walnuts and dried cranberries & blueberries to make them even tastier, but I plan to mix it up a bit and try raisins, dates, pecans, etc......and next time I will add a tablespoon of ground flax seed to make them even more nutritious.  These are barely sweet, and I love them that way, but you could add a little bit more brown sugar if you prefer.  Also, I added a little vanilla as suggested by another reviewer....perfect!

I didn't have quick oats so added 1/4 cup applesauce for extra moisture to the old fashioned oats. Also added blueberries but could add a host of other "surprises". This is a really good & easy muffin to make. I also used real butter, but could possibly use applesauce instead. I had lemon juice to add to milk to make the "buttermilk" called for. Lastly, I made this with my cup for cup gluten free baking flour & it worked out great. Very moist & kid approved!

This was a fabulous base recipe! Very soft and moist, sweet but not overly sugary. I added 2 c. blueberries and 1 c. toasted walnuts. I'm excited to make this over and over again with various combinations of berries, dried fruit, nuts and seeds.

I just made these this morning. I added a little vanilla and used homemade buttermilk. These turned out light and very fluffy. I topped them off with my fresh crock pot apple butter ( also from this site). I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good oatmeal muffin! I had a recipe similar to this awhile back and could never find, I was happy to find these turned out just the same! Followed the recipe exactly, just added frozen huckleberries to half, and the other half added more cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and chopped apples. mmmm.

Very tender muffins.  I added fresh blueberries, lemon extract, and lemon zest.  Froze the leftovers and when thawed and warmed they were as good as if they'd just come from the oven.  Am going to try making them with cranberries, orange extract, and orange zest.

These are good, if I could I would rate it 4.5.
Moist and delicious. I made 2 minor adjustments. I used oil instead of melted butter, and I added 1 cup of grated zucchini.
It seems like a very versatile recipe, you probably add your favorite ingredients to make different variations.

These are great for breakfast!  After reading reviews, I made the following changes on the first (and now every batch):  add ¼ c flax seed, add about 1 tsp vanilla, and a good amount of dried fruit (I used about 1 c of mixed berries).  My husband loves taking them for breakfast on his way to work as does my picky 2-year old.  I will probably make these instead of the mother-in-law's bran muffins for a hearty & healthy breakfast food / snack!

I've made these a few times now. They are so great because they are a so versatile! Very hearty. I usually chuck in some subset of nuts, fruit, or chocolate. They aren't too sweet, so once when I made them with only sliced almonds I added extra sugar. I've never made them with buttermilk, just normal milk and sometimes I add some yogurt for good measure, I just make sure that the oatmeal is moist after combining in the first step. Only complaint is that sometimes when I make them, they stick to the liners...

Yummy! I have two suggestions to change it up a bit. Pulse your whole oats (even steel cut) in the blender/food processer to grind it. This will make the muffins lighter and less chewy, while keeping all the goodness of the oatmeal. Second, add chopped fruit, like strawberries, blueberries, etc.

My muffins came out great. I made the following changes, coconut oil instead of butter and I added a mashed banana and chia seeds for fiber and omega.  I am not a big cinnamon fan so I left that out and  I added almond extract as one reviewer suggested.  The muffins came out sooo tasty.

About the best muffin recipe I've ever come across! 
I used coconut oil instead of butter and topped each muffin with one of coconut flakes, chocolate chips or cranberries before baking. For making 18 muffins I substituted 1.5C all-purpose flour with 3/4C whole wheat flour+1/4C ground flaxseed+1/2C all-purpose flour just to make it a tad bit healthier.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were good. Not to sweet, just like a muffin should be. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding a maple syrup drizzle over the muffins. Will make again.

Other reviewers had noted the muffins were a little dry.  I made batter as written but then filled part way, added a spoonful of raspberry jam then added more batter.  Baked beautifully and the jam added a wonderful flavor and surprise!

Great base oatmeal muffin recipe.  I add a couple of shredded apples and a pureed banana to the recipe.  I also add 1 cup of chocolate chips.  My kids think these are great and they are a terrific addition to their school lunches.  Love that they are not too sweet and that they are not full of oil.  Consistently turn out great.

These were pretty good, I expected a little more after reading other reviews though. I took some of the other reviewers tips and added vanilla extract and topped the muffins with brown sugar before baking. Next time I might add maple extract or almond extract as other reviewers did, maybe even apples. Altogether a decent muffin recipe, good for breakfast on the go! I would definitely add the brown sugar on top, it adds sweetness to the muffins.

I made these muffins yesterday thinking my family could have them in the mornings this week for breakfast..the kids came home from school and they were all gone by the evening! Today I made another batch at the request of my 16 yr old. She also asked me to add some apples to them, so I added 2 gala apples peeled and chopped...the apples was a great idea because they came out delicious! and the apples actually made the muffins moister! Yummy

This is a good basic recipe. I agree that it needs more flavor. Next time, I will add vanilla, maybe ground ginger instead of cinnamon, and maybe raisins. But this was the first time I made oatmeal muffins, and they turned out great.

I thought these muffins lacked flavor.  I added vanilla and topped them with brown sugar before baking and still thought they were rather bland. I will add ripened banana next time and that just may do the trick.
