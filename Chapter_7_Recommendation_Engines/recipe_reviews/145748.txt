I modified this recipe, I used (1) 7.5 oz. can of chipotle peppers in adobo and added a quarter cup of honey.  The contrast of flavors between sweet and hot is incredible, it tastes equally as good on beef or chicken.  This stuff lasts forever in the fridge, and freezes really well also.

Wow - this sauce is amazing, and so easy.  I didn't have any chipotle peppers so I used a teaspoon of chipotle chili powder instead.  I used it to marinade chicken before grilling and the results were wonderful.  We loved the spicy sweet combination.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

I doubled this recipe and marinated a 3lb. pork loin roast for about 3 hours. I cooked it in my Flavorwave oven for about an hour. I left some marinade out of the marinating bag for basting as it cooked and for dipping once it was done. It was DELICIOUS! Just the right amount of sweet and spicy. I even used light maple syrup! Everyone loved it! This sauce/marinade will definately be a regular for us! Can't wait to try it on chicken! Thanks!!

WoW!!  I made this exactly as written and it was perfect for my family.  It makes approx. 3/4 cup of sauce. We grilled pork tenderloin today and basted it with this.  Before basting, I had reserved some of the sauce for dipping.  It is sweet, spicy and smoky.  We will be using this again soon.  My kids loved it too!

I love this. I use it often on pork loin. Once served at a dinner party and had a guest eat three servings! Always a big hit. I grill it!

I think so clarification is needed. We like Extra Spicy food but this was way too spicy and I think I know why.  Because my can of chipotles in adobo sauce was ALL chipotles there wasn't a way for me to add abodo sauce...I could have picked out 2 chipotles but I questioned whether that was the recipe? Instead I used two whole cans - 2 chipotle in adobo sauce cans....  Considering the overpowering hear, this is probably NOT what you meant! What size cans? Or is there a certain brand you recommend?   Sure this is good if done right. Will try with just 2 chipotles...but it's that adobe sauce that we love....

So easy and very tasty.  I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts all day in this and then grilled them over indirect heat.  We sliced the chicken and added to a main course dinner salad.  After tasting, we all agreed that chicken breasts marinated this way would make the best grilled chicken sandwiches ever!  Next time, I'm going to experiment with using honey instead or in addition to the maple syrup.  I will make this again.

Thicken this up on the stove and you have the BEST WING SAUCE EVER!!! When I get a can of chipotles in adobo I puree the whole can and then add to taste. The rest of the puree freezes great so I don't end up wasting the rest of the can.

I used this sauce to top country style that I cooked in the oven at 275 degrees for 2 hours.  I basted with the sauce, and stuck under the broiler.  Due to the high sugar content, it caramelized in about 8 minutes.  Just spicy enough.  I only give it 4 stars b/c it was really too sweet for me.  Next time, I might try adding a little more soy.

Just made this sauce and wow, it's great (smoky, sweet and spicy).  But now I don't know how to use it, other than to brush it on chicken or pork and barbecue. It has so much more potential! Such information would be helpful in the recipe.  BTW sugar free syrup seems to be just fine; can't tell.

Great sauce! I used it to marinade chicken for taquitos. The flavor was great! I followed the recipes exactly. I will definitely make this again and experiment with different meats and dishes.

Ok WOW this sure had a kick to it!  I think it could have used a little more sweet to it, so I added some sugar and a little extra syrup. (of course this just masked the hotness for a few more seconds)  I used it as wing sauce though so this may be my error.  I only recommend this on wings if you like REALLY hot food.  We like hot, but wowzas... this was a little much.  We will marinade our chicken in it and put it on the grill to see if maybe that takes away a little bit of that overpowering heat.  The flavor was great though, just need to cut back on some of that spice.  The kitchen smelled AWESOME (like I had been slaving away all day!) we will definately try this in ways OTHER than wing sauce (and I know that was not the intended purpose of this sauce but was recommended by many reviewers)

I used to buy a sauce called Dr. Pete's Chipotle Grilling Sauce and when the local market stopped carrying it, I looked for a recipe.  This one is AWESOME and even better than the original, i tend to go heavier on the chipotles to spice it up and double the recipe to keep bottled in the fridge for a variety of meals...great recipe!

Got this recipe from the RE and just happened to have all the ingredients on hand that needs to be used up. This was very good and an interesting combination.  I was out of gas so I pan fried my chicken with skin (salt & peppered first) until cooked, basted it with sauce then transfered in a 450 degree oven until bubbly and thickened.

This is really good.  I did add more chipotle for more kick and, since I'm a eastern NC man I had to add some apple cider vinegar for a little twang.

For my family, use only one pepper, to tone down the spiciness...But pretty easy and very yummy. (Lenny liked it with this amount of spiciness)

This was insanely delicious on salmon and chicken. I only used 1/3 cup maple syrup and doubled the garlic. Also, I added a bit of additional adobo sauce along with the sauce that was on the two chipotle peppers. Nice and spicy. We paired our salmon and chicken with a bed of sautéed spinach, onion, garlic, and cherry tomatoes. Heaven!

Two things we love. Chipotle and spicy  So we enjoyed this.  I had a brand of maple syrup I don't normally use and this may have been the slight dislike. I will definitely use it again.

This was excellent and super easy! I found the instructions on chilis a little unclear, here's what I did: buy one 7.5 oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, using table spoon scoop out 1 chipotle pepper and adobo sauce to fill spoon, scoop total of two chipotle peppers/sauce and blend with other ingredients. I did a taste taste and decided it was way too hot for my liking. To remedy this I added an extra 1/3 cup syrup and 1 TBS soy sauce. This made the perfect amount so I could use half for marinade and half for basting chicken after it was cooked.

This is my families new favorite sauce!  So quick and easy....and delicious!  I have added a generous TBSP of fresh grated ginger to the recipe for a different twist on the original and we really like it too.  I am going to experiment with a little curry powder added to the original and then add some currants after processing.  Think that will be great with chicken!
