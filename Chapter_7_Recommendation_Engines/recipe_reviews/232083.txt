This recipe was a huge hit with my husband and friends.  I'm not an onion fan but even without them the taste was really good.  Great for a cold winter day!

I followed the recipe to a T except I browned the chorizo before adding it to the chilli pot. My hubby hates beans so I was in search of a good bra less chilli. THIS IS IT! I love beans and didn't miss them in this chilli at all. It will be my go to recipe from now on!

This was a good recipe.  I was a little apprehensive about adding the tomato soup and tomato juice but it worked out well.

I halved this recipe. Other reviews said it was not spicy enough so I added only the sauce from a small can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Spicy and delicious!

Added a scoop of cocoa, and used jarred fire roasted red bell peppers instead of fresh. Spectacular with corn, cheese, fritos, and jalapeño garnishes!

This had a great flavor and tasted even better the second day.  Makes a good amount.  I'm making this for the office chili cookoff contest!

I love chili and my husband hates beans. So I've been searching for a good beanless chili. This one is delicious but unfortunately, my husband is not a fan. More for me!! I did not include the sausage because I simply don't like it, but apart from that modification, I stuck with the recipe. It made a TON. I had 4 quarts leftover...after two full bowls for dinner. The flavor is really good. I might decrease the amount of peppers next time just for preference. All in all, a great recipe and one I will make again...all for me! :-)

Great recipe! I didn't bother with the water. We never missed the beans. Definitely will make again. Just the right amount of spice. I did halve the recipe and adjusted the tomatoes until it looked enough.

My son’s girlfriend does not like beans. I tried this recipe and it was such a hit, I doubt I will go back to my traditional bean recipe.  My only variation was the addition of garlic.  Enjoy!

Even better the next day..Didn't add green peppers, they are over priced this time of year, I rarely add them for any recipe.

I did not use the mystery meat chorizo, we grind our our beef and make sausage, so I know what's in it....and what parts are processed.
 I have always used tomato soup in chili, this is the 1st recipe  I have seen that calls for...it smooths and mellows the flavors

Very good! I wound up just using green peppers instead of the other peppers because I am an absolutely baby when it comes to spice. This was a nice and easy recipe for a beginner to follow and it tasted great :)

Nice job with this. It's nice to see someone who knows that real chili does not contain beans. Nothing at all bland about this.

Have made this 3 times and it is fabulous! I don't add the sausage but have added kidney beans - always a big hit!

The body of the chili is tomato juice and tomato soup. This makes it very flavorful. I used a verity of peppers from my Farmers Market and 1lb ground turkey and NO sausage. I also added about 3-4 Tblsp of cinnamon . It is my favorite chili . I also made it with a can of pumpkin . Delicious!!

Good taste but needs cumin and chili pepper to ground the flavor. Depending on how you much liquid you like in your chilli it probably only needs two cups of v8.

Loved this! Made a few minor tweaks- personal preference more than anything. I only used 2 of the 4 red peppers and I added cumin and minced garlic. It gets even better as leftovers.
