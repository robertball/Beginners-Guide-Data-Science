The pancakes were easy to make and tasty, an added bonus is that they are dairy free which makes my older son happy. I did not make the topping as my youngest son wanted maple syrup. I think the topping would have been a delicious addition though. I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. I would have liked a stronger coconut flavour, maybe a drop of coconut extract would be good.
