My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this.  I accidentally forgot to buy sour cream, so I ended up just sprinkling the dill weed on top.  I used much less butter too to cut down on the fat.  Still yummy and the smoked Gouda definitely enhances the salmon flavor.  Will make again.  Thank you!

I will cut the crab in half next time.  Makes a good presentation for a "fancy" meal.  The sauce has a wonderful lemon flavor.

I had high expectations for this dish...and it delivered!!! My boyfriend was wowed by the presentation of the salmon and even more impressed by the taste. The cut of salmon I purchased was a bit too thick, masking the flavor of the crab. I also sliced the gouda too thinly, making it almost non-existant in the dish. I was afraid the cheese would override the flavor of both the salmon and crab.  The dill sauce turned out phenomenal! I added a little more dill then called for, because I love dill((about three tablespoons))! I also doubled the lemon butter sauce and really coated the fillets((only made 2 fillets))! This recipe is definently a keeper!!! Can't wait to make it again!

This is the first time I felt motivated to give a review.  Our salmon was very thick so it took a little longer to cook.  Like many others I have a tendency to modify recipes, but when I try one for the first time, unless we are missing an ingredient I stick to it and make notes on how to modify it for future.  No modifications necessary, it was perfect. I might look for a better quality of lump crabmeat next time.  The canned crabmeat we had was more like shredded crab.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Not bad.  I thought the Gouda would be the best part of this, but the dill sauce was what made the dish.

Loved it. Added crab to only half of the fillets and was (almost) equally as good. The lemon and butter source as well as the sour cream is too much, I'll half it next time.

I made this lastnight for the BF and myself and it was wonderful! I changed it a little because I purchased too much crab. I left the salmon open-faced, placed the sliced gouda cheese acordingly then seasoned the crab with a seasoning my friend special orders (I believe it's similar to Old Bay ) and mounded about 1/2 cup of crab atop each salmon portion then baked as directed. I put the sour cream mixture on the fish for the last five minutes or so of cooking time.

This was quite good. The flavors all melded together nicely. The only issue was that the Gouda didn't melt so next time I'll grate it instead of using slices and since we like cheese (a lot!) I plan on increasing the amount of cheese.

Did not make it 100% to directions. Boyfriend doesn't like sour cream. But this works extremely well with a dill white sauce as well. Amazing combination of flavours. I like sour cream though and that was perfect too. Very easy to throw together and impressive to company.

I made this exactly as is.  I considered that the lemon butter glaze plus the sour cream sauce plus the Gouda would be overkill, but they were not.  

Like other reviewers, I found the crab was lost and likely to be an unnecessary expense. 

Beautiful and delicious- definitely something to impress company... or just your significant other!

I used half Greek yogurt and half sour cream for the sour cream sauce. This next time, I will be using only Greek yogurt. It was wonderful!

I varied the stuffing because I was short on time.  I bought a king crab salad and put it in my Nutra Bullet. It was like a paste, almost. The celery in it was great and baby shrimp.  Perfect.  I drizzled some melted butter over the top.  It was a great hit. My sauce was lemon yogurt and I added dill and a little mayo. Yummmmmmmy
