The reviews that state that the alcohol taste is too strong, are probably using a house whiskey.  A good name brand should be used to produce a better result. This could be why the ratings are on opposite ends of the scale.  I have used Crown because the dish come out tasting great, and I take pride in my culinary creations.  I have also used Jameson and gotten excellent results.  If Old Crow brand is chosen, even if it is their best 7 day old, I cannot vouch for the results.  ;-)  Happy Day!

I made this last weekend, it turned out great!  I love all the ingrediants, which is what caught my eye, and the combination of them was perfect. I let the chicken sit in the marinade for about 5 hrs, in the fridge. I really wanted to grill the chicken and then cook down the rest of the marinade for a dipping sauce......but couldn't get the grill to turn on! Either way, the family loved it and the chicken was juicy. I will try again with the grill next time and update later.  Thanks Wolf for an awesome recipe!  :+)

i decided to bbq the chicken instead of cooking it in the oven.  It came out full of flavor and delicous.

This was a huge hit! Most thought it was the best they ever had. Very flavorful, yet easy to make.

The cooking time definitely has to be adjusted accordingly to the chicken type/pieces you use. Easy to modify the amount of bourbon to your taste. I used  Kentucky Straight Bourbon (handmade.) The kind of bourbon you use does play a role in the outcome of the taste.

Absolutely love this, better even than my favorite restaurant's version.  Cut up the chicken into bite sized bits.  I only had time to marinate for 1 hour, and then I kind of stir fried it on the stove top instead of oven baking.  Just added a bit of corn starch at the end to thicken sauce a bit and omitted the wine.  Wonderful recipe!!!

It had a really strong liquor taste. Maybe next time I'll make some changes.

Outstanding! Used Wild Turkey...I also use fresh garlic and onion. We're going to cook it up on the grill next time, as well as trying the sauce out on wings. Wild Turkey all the way Baby!

I did not care for this recipe. Who cooks chicken for an hour? I made this EXACTLY as written, despite my better judgement. Chicken was dry, tough. Sauce tasted like soy sauce with extra salt in it. After baking, there remains little (if any) liquid to combine with the wine. Compete waste of bourbon.

Holy Sodium, Batman! The soy sauce totally takes over. Cut the soy in half, and this recipe is perfect. Our 5-year-old even requests it.

Loved this recipe. I cooked it for 1 hour, 45 minutes. It turned out great. I followed the suggestions & used a really good bourbon.

We loved the flavors and versitility of this recipe.  We didnt have Burbon so I used Maple Crown. We also dont like chicken breasts so I used legs.  The marinade was great and we will be making this again.  Next time with boneless thighs.,  Cant wait

This was a easy weeknight meal enjoyed by all, including my four year old.  I used whole boneless, skinless thighs and put them in the marinade before work, then when I got home I threw it in the oven with a simple rice pilaf, and dinner was on the table in an hour.  I skipped the step of transferring to a skillet and adding the wine at the end because it just seemed like extra dishes to wash!  I may try adding just a little corn starch to the sauce next time, so it will thicken slightly in the oven.

The only change I made is add more garlic powder, since we love garlic! I baked for about 40 minutes and did the skillet thing with White Zinfandel and served over rice.  It is excellent and will make again!

I choose this recipe because i wanted a same day meal. I think that had I have marinated it longer then 3 hours the results may have been better. The flavour was very good and the recipe produces enough sauce to serve over rice.
I also added stir fried veggies (onion, broccoli and celery)
I prefer a saucier bourbon chicken. I used Jim Bean bourbon.

I read the reviews and cut down the soy sauce a bit. The only other change I made was using fresh garlic, fresh ginger and fresh onion. Holy smokes, this was good! I thought it was a little on the rich and sweet side, although my husband and son disagree. Next time I will sneakily cut the brown sugar and the bourbon down a bit and see if they notice.

Followed recipe using Crown Royal and boneless skinless chicken thighs. Cooked it in a pressure cooker for 25 minutes, omitting the white wine- served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. It was awesome!!! This will be a regular:)

Made this just as it's written and it was a little too overpowering for my household.  Next time we will be cutting the Bourbon to 1/4 cup.   We served it with sticky rice & steamed broccoli, carrot & cauliflower.
