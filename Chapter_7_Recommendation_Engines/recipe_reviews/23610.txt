Great spaghetti recipe.  However seems to be made for a huge party.  My fault for not converting the 12 quarts to something I can relate to.  Be warned, this is made for a large party or for storage.  Adding a little red wine spices this up a bit.

This is a great, easy pasta sauce.  I added mushrooms, and didn't put the spices in until I took it off the stove (to avoid cooking out the flavor.)  I also used more garlic, because I'm a big fan of garlic.  We will make this again!

I was not impressed with this.  It didn't have much flavor, other than being too oniony and bell peppery.  This recipe might be good if altered, but it is not good as written.

I ended up using a little extra spice, and I think using olive oil as your oil will give it a more authentic flavor.

This is my favourite spaghetti sauce. The family all love it. My only problem is that I haven't bought a pot big enough yet to make it without cutting the recipe in half.

A solid tomato sauce base! I can see this being great with some beef meatballs or pork Italian sausage.
