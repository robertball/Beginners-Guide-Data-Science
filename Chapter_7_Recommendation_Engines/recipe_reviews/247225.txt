Love it, but I chopped up basil and added that to the mashed avocados.

1 tsp of garlic salt was way too much. Had to throw out. Probably meant garlic powder or a sprinkling of garlic salt

A refreshing treat! I used nutritional yeast instead of garlic salt. Thank you for the recipe.

1 teaspoon of garlic salt is a bit much for 1/2 of an avocado. I used the garlic salt to taste and lightly toasted the ciabatta. This is definitely worth making again and again.
