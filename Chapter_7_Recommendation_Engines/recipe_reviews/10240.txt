I've been looking for this recipe for a while now, but I'm confused on the the amount of oil. The recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of veg. oil and then a quart for frying, but it doesn't tell you when to add the 2 1/2 cups of veg. oil. Was there a typo or am I really blind?

Please do not add water. Just bring oil and wine to a boil, add a pinch of salt to flour and mix with oil and wine mixture, 
fry and coat with honey. 
delicious

This recipe does not work. Tried it twice and no results.  Dough is way to wet even at only two cups.  Then tried adding mord flour and at 3/4 cup gave up.  When cooked in oil we tried some for 10 minutes and even then although outside was crisp inside was wet.

This is a super huge recipe. I make a large batch of dough w/ 1 cup oil, 1 cup wine, 1 cup water and about 6-8 cups of flour until it workable. Also add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. cloves and the finely chopped orange peel of 3 large oranges.  Fry them then honey them. I like to add a couple of Tbsp of sugar to the sugar to form a glaze.

We edited the recipe to include the oil and address the many issues that users have had with the amount of water in the recipe.

Thank you, I have been searching for this recipe for 7 years. It was a Christmas tradition to make Italian Wine cookies since I was a child. This one of the easiest and most deliciousest cookies I know. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you, again.
Tejani.

I tried this recipe today and because of the way it is written, it was a disaster.  Didn't know whether to add the 2 1/2 cups of oil to the mixture.  It doesn't  say to add it to the mixture and I didn't.  Therefore, it was very dry evn though I added the extra 1/2 cup of water.  They were very hard after frying.  What a shame to waste all that good wine and time.  I guess I was supposed to add that oil.  However, I would think that would make it very wet as another person said.  Afraid to ever try it again, although I had fond memories of them.  Wonder if I could have salvaged the dough by adding some oil after it was mixed. Oh well, you win some and lose some.  Just wanted to let others know.

Awful. I cut down the water to less than 1/2 a cup, and still had to knead in more flour to make the dough workable. The worst part though, was that it *exploded* in the hot oil.

These cookies are interesting and I couldn't eat just one! Just the  right amount of sweetness and wine. I'm going to try them out at a party with the appetizers. Very tasty!

these were much better the day after I made them. The honey needs to soak into the cookie, otherwise they taste too bitter. My grandmother from Italy used to make these around the holidays, and my dad said they taste just like hers.

We put the rolled cookies on brown paper for about 30 minutes  BEFORE frying.  Then allow to cool completely  on brown paper before putting  in the honey.  Best if made about  a week  ahead of time
