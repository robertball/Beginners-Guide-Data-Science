Fantastic!  These are *real* cannoli shells!  If you're a beginner cook and not really confident in your skills, then use one of the other recipes that are full of shortening and eggs.  If you know what you're doing in the kitchen and want to make real, authentic cannoli, this recipe is the way to go.

I had a hard time with this recipe, finally getting it into a ball (since there is no butter maybe), and after kneading it for the full 15 minutes the recipe states, it was very tough and chewy! What did I do wrong?

Tasty!  My preparation took a bit more than 3/4 cups wine.  I have no access to cannoli shells, and this recipe was very authentic, so nice.

Like others have said, too much flour and not enough wine. I added a little butter, as well, because other recipes that I've found from Italian families contain butter or shortening. I am an experienced cook and the review that was insulting anyone who had trouble with this recipe was out of line. If you have trouble, add some more wine if you need to. And, no shame in adding some butter too. Whatever works and makes it taste good. Mine turned out great after the changes.

I added more wine than the recipe called for and still couldn't get the dough workable. The dough was so tough I couldn't roll it out.

I haven't tried it yet but I wanted to know where do you get the wraps from. I live in a small town and I'm not sure if Wal-Mart would have them. They don't even make/sell cannolis

Almost our family recipe.  Ours has 1 1/2 cups of port wine instead of 3/4 cup.  If the dough is dry, add water as needed. But they come out perfect every time.
