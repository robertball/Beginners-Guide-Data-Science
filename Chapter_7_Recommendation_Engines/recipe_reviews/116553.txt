I made this twice in the past week, just what I was craving! I did make a few changes...I have a toddler who doesn't eat nuts yet so I omitted the nuts and instead put in 3/4 cup of quick rolled oats. I wasn't sure how that would work but it turned out great!  I also used 1/2 all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. Again this is a change I will be keeping on this recipe. I put the preserves right up almost to the edge of the bars because the first time I made it my husband and I found the edges with no jam a bit dry/bland. All in all this was a great, quick and easy recipe. Next time I make these I was thinking I might drizzle some chocolate over the top for a little extra personal touch.

I took this to my boyfriend's family party, and it was the first time that his mother ever asked ME for a recipe! Everyone loved these--there was a ton of stuff out for dessert and these disappeared FAST. I did make a few changes to the recipe--I used 3/4c white sugar and 3/4c brown sugar, chopped pecans instead of almonds (thats's just what I had on hand), and I used a 9x13 pan. I made sure to spread the preserves all the way to the edges like another reviewer suggested, and that worked great. I also had to add a lot of extra flour and brown sugar at the end to make the crumbly top, but in the end, this was AMAZING--and quick and easy too!

I had high hope for this quickie recipe,however,I will only give it 3stars as written.I did sub 3 drops of lemon extract for the lemon zest and used pecans instead of almonds,but I do not believe those changes affected the problems I had. First of all it was waaaay to sweet,and I would cut the sugar to 1cup (or less) as the preserves are already sweetened. My second issue was with the topping. I added 1/2cup rolled oats,1/4cupground pecans,and more flour( than the1/4cup called for)before I ever got the batter to even begin to crumble. Sorry,I guess I'm the loneranger on this one----

very tasty bars. the base (cakey bottom) will be spread very thin, but bakes up nice. I added the almonds to the top crumbles only so they would brown and stay crunchy. I spread the jam to the edges of the pan (I don't like dry end pieces) then after it baked, I ran a knife around the edges to loosen and keep the jam from drying on the pan.  Baked nicely in a 9x13 pan and I subbed 1 cup of WW flour and cut the sugar to 1 cup. With the sweet jam it would have been too sweet for us. Great coffee cake.

Made this for the Recipe Group, I halved the ingredients as I do not have a 9x13 pan (nor the larger one called for) and after 'consulting' with Redneck Gramma, went with the 9 x 9 pan with the halved ingred.  Love the hint of lemon in the base, goes very well with the Strawberry jam, I wasn't stingy on the jam either  :D I only put the almonds on the topping as I too like my almonds toasty and crunchy.  I have some wild blueberry jam made from last summer that would be perfect in this recipe and will be trying that next. Great recipe, it's a keeper :)

I made these for Recipe Group. I creamed butter and sugar in food processor, then added the rest. I should have chopped the almonds a little first, but they came out ok. Gave nice flavor and texture to the dough. Dough doesn't really crumb, pressed into pan easy. 12 oz jar is not enough to make a 10x15 in my opinion. I put the strawberry on and it seemed too thin, so I moved it down to half of the side and added some plum to the other half. Cooked up nicely, I lifted the whole thing out after cooling completely and put on cutting board; I had foiled the pan. Stuck a little on the edges where jam was too close, otherwise worked fine. Cut with pizza cutter into squares. I thought the strawberry was a little sweet for me, but good flavor all the way around. Nice recipe Marna, thanks.

Maybe it was just me, but I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. It seemed like a lot of dry bar, and not a lot of jam. I did make this in a 13 x 9" pan, so the crust was thicker than it was supposed to be, but there wasn't enough jam. Oh, and I only used one cup of sugar in the crust, omitting the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe. I think it would have made the bars way too sweet. I did like the addition of the lemon peel in the crust, though...it gave it a nice, springy flavor. I did make one other alteration...I skipped the almonds in the batter, and put them all in the topping instead, to make it more crumbly. Altogether, it's a tolerable recipe, but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks for sharing, though!

Made these for Recipe Group and they are DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, but could've probably used a pan that was a little bigger, as they were a little thick. I only had sliced almonds, so I used those, crushing them slightly. Also, I did not measure the lemon zest or strawberry preserves, just eye-balled them. The only thing for me, which it was still fine, was that the dough was never like a coarse crumb, but a sticky batter type thing, so I just spread it in the pan and that worked out great. These were like a fruit filled shortbread...SO YUMMY! These would be wonderful with pretty much any fruit filling, and I can't wait to try other flavors! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was extremely disappointed with these bars.  The crust baked up nice and brown, but it crumbled apart once cut.  It was entirely too sweet and the preserves give it a fake flavor.  I had high hopes, but was sorely disappointed.  My kids ate some and enjoyed them (hey they're kids--they eat anything with sugar), but they were so messy and crumbly.

This was just OK for us.  I made it by the recipe except halved it and made it in a 9x9 pan.  I think it could have used a little more uuumph in the flavor department----maybe almond extract in the crust?  Maybe lemon juice in the mix?  Something.  It will not be wasted, though!  It will be fine with coffee!

Here we go with a change:) I forgot to pick up a lemon so I used orange zest & made 1/2 strawberry & 1/2 blackberry. The orange overpowered the strawberry but it was incredible with the blackberry! A great recipe to play w/different variations! Made for Recipe Group.

I made this for the Recipe Group:  19, March '11.  Good bar cookie recipe.  I made a half a batch and baked in a 11 x 7 pan for 25 minutes.  Made half the pan with strawberry jam and the other half with red raspberry jam.  We liked the red raspberry best.  I think what I liked most about this recipe is that the bars cut REALLY nice.  You could get nice clean cuts and they lifted out of the pan without tearing. Pretty presentation to share somewhere.  Thanks for this weeks recipe.

Made these for the Recipe Group this week. These are very good! The whole family enjoyed them and gave a thumbs-up across the board. I couldn't find my 15x10 pan so went with a 13x9. This worked out perfect and I would hesitate to use the larger pan in the future because it seems that there would not
be enough preserves to cover the base. It was the perfect amount using a 13x9.
I coarsly chopped the almonds by hand and we really like the slightly crunchy texture. Used the zest from one lemon (didn't measure the 1 teaspoon). The little citrus hit in the dough is really nice. The recipe asks that you mix the dough until it resembles coarse crumbs. 
My dough never had that crumbly texture. It was more like a soft cookie dough that spread easily in the pan. The bake time in my oven in a 13x9 was about 27 minutes. Quick and easy recipe with great
flavor and texture. We will definitely enjoy these again. Thanks for sharing!

Not sure if it was just me, but these didn't come out they way I had hoped.  I couldn't seem to mix the dough properly and it ended up being extremely sticky and would not spread on the pan easily.   A lot of work for a cookie that everyone thought was just okay.

I made this last night for a family dinner. Everyone said they liked it, but I didn't at all. I think I should've doubled the jam or cut back on the flour. I did use whole wheat and I think that made a difference.

These came out very well. I used a jelly roll pan, and got 40 bars. I used 14 oz. of preserves and probably could've used more. I put most of my almonds on top so they'd get toasted. Unlike others, I did NOT have a pourable batter. Mine did form coarse crumbs. I was a little late for Recipe Group, but these were worth the wait :) Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group selection 3/19/11.  These turned out different than I expected, because of the way the dough was described, I expected more of a streusel top.  I cut the sugar back to a rounded 1/2 cup and I'm glad I did.  I kept forgetting to buy a lemon, so I replaced the zest with a few drops of lemon extract.  I chopped half my almonds and added then to the botton crust and left the rest in slices for the topping.  My filling was raspberry jam.  I am impressed by how cleanly the squares cut and how easy it was to remove them from the pan.  I can see many possibilities using this dough.  Thanks Marna!

I searched endlessly online and on this site for a good strawberry bar recipe. This was hard to find. This recipe is fabulous. I never make anything exactly like the recipe. It was how I was taught! That said, my changes were minor. I did not have almonds, so I added rolled oats. Super good idea! I added lemon juice to the batter (about 1.5 tsp.) I always think it's a good idea to beat to holy heck outta the butter/sugar mix, and this worked out well for this recipe. I did use 1 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. When it had been in the oven for about 15 or so minutes I took a spatula and moved all the strawberry and topping around and it looked beautiful when it came out. I did add a lemon icing to accent the flavor. This was the closest thing to one of those Entenmans coffee cakes I have ever made. I won't admit how much of it I ate last night. I am impressed with this recipe. So many options. Thanks, Marna. I will make this a regular item in my kitchen with different preserves. So so so good.

Thank you for the recipe; I did use apricot preserves & vanilla flavoring, minus the lemon peel.  I drizzled confec. sugar/milk for the cooled bars.  This is a keeper, excellent Marna :)

I used my mom's homemade guava jelly in place of strawberry and cut back on the sugar.  I also skipped the almonds as I didn't have any.  My 11-year-old taste tester proclaimed them yummy.

I purchased a mix for something very similar from Tastefully Simple that my family loved, but it was like $8 a box and you still had to add your own wet ingredients and preserves.  So when I found this recipe, I was really excited.  I used a whole 18 oz jar of apricot preserves as opposed to the 12 oz in the recipe.  I also omitted the lemon peel and substituted almond extract instead.  It made enough for my boyfriend to take some to work and to keep a small batch at home.  I loved it and I will definitely try again with different kinds of preserves and nut combinations.  Thanks for sharing!!

Sweet and tasty. I skipped the lemon zest and used 1/4 t. of almond extract, this was a nice addition. I only used 1 cup of sugar and this was plenty.  I think you could even go down to 3/4 cup of sugar on this one.  The preserves add a lot of sweetness. Didn't have almonds and it was not missed.

I used some homemade jam that I made and it turned out delicious! I didn’t have enough almonds so I also used pecans, Mmmmm. :)

I made these with apricot preserves and no almonds. I used a slightly larger jar of preserves than the recipe calls for and they came out delicious!

I made this for Recipe Group!  EXCELLENT!!  I made half the recipe and used an 11x7” baking dish.  I lined it with non-stick foil (love that stuff) and left extensions so I could lift it right out of the pan once it had cooled.   I made this exactly as written, with the exception of using almost twice as much strawberry preserves.  My dough wasn’t crumbly, but more like cookie dough.  It was pretty sticky, so I dampened my fingers with water and was able to get a nice even layer of dough.  I used my little off-set spatula to spread the preserves which worked very well for this.  I, too, put all my almonds in the topping, rather than in the dough.  Hubs is taking these to share with his tennis buddies tomorrow.  I think they’ll be very pleased!!

This is the best dessert I have ever made!  My husband and 2 year old daughter went nuts over these bars!!!

F.Y.I   - I used organic blueberry jam and chopped pecans. The lemon mixed in was over the top.

Highly recommend making these.

This is a great bar recipe!  Like others, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and I did not put the almonds in the crust but rather on top.  I also used 17oz of strawberry jam.  Really delicious and not overly sweet.

These turned out quite well and were very easy to throw together.  I made a few minor changes based on previous reviewers suggestions.  I used a 9x13 pan, increased the preserves to 16 oz. and reserved all the almonds for the topping.  I also reduced the sugar by half and used almond extract in place of the lemon zest.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Marna Heitz!

These were just ok for me despite the "rave reviews". The amount of jam didn't seem enough for the amount of batter. I also sprinkled a dusting of powdered sugar on the top. I liked the combination of the almonds and strawberry and even tried the receipe twice, once with white flour and once with a mix of white and wheat. I did like the white/wheat mix better but still not keeping this one as there are others so much better.

I wasn't very impressed with these.  I think you need way more jam.  They tasted just like strawberry pop tarts!

Reminded me of eating a scone with jam when warm. I added a spoonful or so more jam to make sure I covered the edges. Also added a bit more flour to the topping to make it crumble. It's such a simple receipe tweaking to taste is easy.

I liked this recipe, but it wasn't over the top.  I didn't have any lemons to zest, so I tried adding some lemon juice but don't think I added enough.  Next time I think I'd try some almond extract instead to bring out the almond flavor some more.  I also used a whole 18 oz jar of preserves.  I could see doing this dessert with a lot of different flavors - someone suggested that lemon curd would be nice to try.

We both thought these were excellent.  I subbed in 1/2 tsp of lemon extract for the lemon peel but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, using butter.  I didn't have a 10x15 so used a 9x12, a tight fit but they still turned out quite nice.  I'll definately be making these again.  Thanks for the great recipe Marna.

Didn't have lemon zest or almonds so I added a few drops of lemon & almond extract and substituted 3/4 c of oats for the almonds. Absolutely wonderful!

I made a half batch in a 9x9, and they came out pretty good for me.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the dough, plus half of the almonds.  Though the bottom crust dough did not crumb (stayed sticky), that didn't hurt anything. It was a little difficult to spread evenly in the pan so I did as someone else suggested, I wet my fingertips and patted it down which created a nice edge to spread the preserves right up to.  I was able to get the topping to crumb, using a pastry cutter, added the rest of the almonds to the topping.  It baked up beautifully, although it took about 30-35 mins.  The end result came out nice and moist (the crust), partially due to subbing in brown sugar for some of the white, plus I greased the pan generously. I was pleased with this because the crust looked dense and dry in some of the pics (which I don't care for).  LOVE the lemon in the crust! And the crunch of the almonds is nice too (I chopped mine). The only thing I'm not super crazy about is the preserves. I wish it were more of a fresh strawberry flavor, so I may see what I can do about that next time. UPDATE: These are better the second day!  Really happy with them now.

These were great, I love the lemon zest!  For the most part I followed the recipe.  Only changes were I used half brown sugar, half white, added a tsp of vanilla and toasted the almonds prior to adding them.

Very good bars. I added about 18 ounces of strawberry jam and I think they were perfect. A definite make again.

These were a HUGE hit at my house. I took three previous suggestions and used 3/4 sugar and 3/4 brown sugar, spread the preserves all the way to the edge, and put in rolled oats into the topping mix. The preserves container was actually a 15 oz jar and I used all of it. Oh and I put wheat germ in it too. I had to cook it extra time but it was sooooooooooooo worth it! It was pure heaven!

I made these without changing a thing! They went big time, right away they were gone. One thing I did do was to use my homemade preserves. This one is a keeper!
