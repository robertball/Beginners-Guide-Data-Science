I made cupcakes and filled them with the cream filling. Then I made a buttercream icing flavored with banana extract. It was great!!

These are scrumptious, yummy and delicious. They remind me of the Banana Suzy-Q's we used to buy back home.
Everyone LOVES these!

I have to thank you for this gem in my recipe box! The frosting filling was perfect. It wasn't too sweet or heavy, so it didn't overpower the delicious flavors of the banana cake. I will definitely be trying variations of this recipe using chocolate cake for a traditional Suzie-Q cake. Also, I'm going to try adding in a bit of peanut butter to the frosting for a PB Chocolate treat I know my family will appreciate. Thanks so much for sharing this one!

I think this would've been great, but reeeeally didn't want to use full fat butter AND shortening, so I used reduced-fat Blue Bonnet margarine.  The end result; the frosting tasted right, but the texture was running and greasy-looking. Not appetizing, not that fluffy filling I was so excited about.  Not even usable. Bummer!  So, my advice is to definitely use full-fat butter/shortening if you make this.

These were so yummy.  I couldn't stop eating them.  The filling is excellent.  I used chocolate cake instead.

Oh so good. I used a mini loaf pan for 1/2 the recipe and made cupcakes with the rest of the batter. Baked them both for 16 minutes. The cake is really tasty. I wasn't thrilled with the frosting at first it was a little grainy and not very sweet. I added about 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 2T cream. Could be that it was grainy because I was out of shortening so I used all butter. Not sure if that was why it was grainy or not. Family loved these.
