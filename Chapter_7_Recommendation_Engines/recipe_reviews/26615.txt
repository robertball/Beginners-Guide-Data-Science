These were excellent but I did make a few changes. I didn't boil the peppers first and they were cooked perfect after 40 minutes in the oven, 25 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered at 400 degrees. Be sure to drizzle your baking dish with olive oil first.  I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes, 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, chili powder, and oregano for extra flavor. My husband loves cheese so I mixed some in with the meat and sprinkled more on top at the end.

These are really, really good!  I just started working at a restaurant and have learned some new things, so I actually tweaked this: (1) Put the dried garlic in the rice water so that the rice is infused with the garlic flavor. (2)Don't boil the peppers, blanch them.  This keeps them from getting too discolored when you pre-cook them.  (Don't worry, they will still cook sufficiently in the oven.) (3) Add about 1/2 teaspoon coriander and cumin and then add cayenne pepper to taste after you add the tomato sauce.  This takes care of other reviewers complaints that there's not enough flavor, but as you cook this, taste it to make sure it is what you want in flavor.  ALWAYS TASTE AS YOU GO WHEN YOU COOK !!!!! 
(4)  These really only need about 30 minutes in the oven to get soft too, so don't overdo it.  I hope you find these comments helpful!  In the immortal words and voice of Julia Child, "Bon Appetit!"

I would advise either adding about a cup of Ketchup...or simply buying about 20 or more ounces of Spagetti sauce, and using it instead of the meager amount of Tomato sauce posted in this recipe. Much better taste. Also...when you par-boil something...the meat is already cooked..etc...it does not need to be in the oven for 45 minutes. That's big time over-kill. I baked mine for 20 minutes, then added the cheese and melted it for 6 minutes. Keeps the peppers firmer.

We really enjoyed this meal.  The first time I did as was written exactly and my husband and 14 year old really liked it.  My two younger kids (5 and 2) wouldnt touch it, but I really didn't expect them to.  I made it again tonite, but spiced up the meat mixture a little more with season salt and a good amount of garlic powder.  I also used instant brown rice and it worked very well.  I also poured a can of tomatoe soup (I mixed water with it as if I were making soup) in the bottom of the pan as it was cooking in the oven and it made for a really tasty sauce.  I really enjoyed it this way better and have already added this recipie to my box.

Tasting the stuffing before it was baked, I knew this was going to be horribly bland.  Also, I felt there was too much rice.  I added cumin, chili powder, worcestershire sauce and soy sauce, and rather than shredding the cheese and using it as a topping, I cubed it and mixed it in with the stuffing just before stuffing.  They turned out great this way!!!

My family loves this recipe.  I had never made stuffed peppers before.  My husband actually will not eat peppers on/in anything.  I decided to try it anyways and everyone loved them.  My picky 2yr old loved them and my father raved about how much better they were than my Mom's peppers (forbid!).  I've used chopped canned tomatoes, tomato sauce and spaghetti sauce.  My family seems to prefer the spaghetti sauce overall.  I also use both cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  Try this recipe!

Adding mushrooms is a great addition that I did & since I usually have medium cheddar cheese on hand. I would like to add a note (someone else may have said this, too..I haven't read reviews yet). Making stuffed peppers is a whole lot easier if you set them in muffin/cupcake tins. They don't tip over.

A friend gave me some bell peppers from her garden and I was looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand..these were very tasty and I would make again. I like more sauce so I added chopped tomatoes and tomato sauce to mixture..then I poured a small can of tomato juice over the peppers before placing in the oven.

These were great!  They are easy to prepare and I had almost all of the ingredients in my pantry already.  I chose not to boil the peppers and just bake them longer, but some parts were still hard, so from now on I will boil the peppers first.  Other than that, everyone raved!  Excellent recipe.

The only change I made was I cut my peppers in half & removed the insides. I put them in a microwave safe pie plate, put water in the peppers, and microwaved them for 4 to 5 minutes. Discard water, and they are blanched without boiling on the stove.

Really delicious! Only giving 4 stars because I used so many suggestions from other reviews. Recipe also makes enough for at least 4+ peppers, so I will freeze the leftovers. Husband liked the filling so much said he would eat it plain! These are the adjustments I made to the recipe.  1. Blanched peppers for 5 minutes in boiling water (I used one red, yellow and green) 2. Cooked ground beef with 1/2 chopped onion, 1 clove of garlic (we are not huge onion and garlic fans), s&p, Worcestershire sauce, Italian spices 3. After draining beef added rice and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce with Italian seasonings and 1/2 a jar of spaghetti sauce and cooked 5-10 minutes 4. Poured enough spaghetti sauce in a 9X13 pan to coat the bottom, about 1/4 cup, then put the peppers in the pan.  5. Filled the peppers and baked covered for 30 minutes. 6. Removed cover, sprinkled with mozzarella and baked 5 minutes more.  Next time I will skip the mozzarella and just top with shredded Parmesan and Romano! I will definitely make this again!

Good recipe.  I also add a cup of frozen corn.  I suggest that you slit a few small holes in the bottom of the pepper so the fat from the ground beef doesn't lay in the bottom of the pepper.

I'm always looking for ways to make recipes quicker and easier since I don't usually have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.    I have been making stuffed peppers for 40 years using basically this same recipe.  The difference is that I don't precook anything.  I use raw ground beef, uncooked peppers, uncooked rice (sometimes minute rice) and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. If I use tomato sauce, I add Worchestershire, various seasonings or whatever sounds good at the time.  They do have to cook longer, though.    This method is so much easier and a lot less clean-up. I have also made them the evening before, refrigerated them  and just popped them in the oven when I got home from work the next evening.  They also aren't bad in the crock pot.

I made these with a few tweeks, made it more flavorful and spicey, yummy! I read the other reviews as I always do and came up with this...I never measure anything, I always eyeball it... I doubled the meat, and used ground turkey to make it healthier. I did add the garlic powder to the rice as it cooked. I added 2 lg garlic cloves, worceshire (sp) sauce, coriander, cayenne, chili powder, cumen, oregano, italian seasoning, little bit of bread crumbs, little extra tom sauce and can diced tomatoes. I also added parm and mozzarella cheeses to the meat mixture. Then I topped the peppers with the mozz cheese as well. I just sprinkled enough of each of the spices over the meat once it cooked, not too much of each, but enough to def give it flavor. The cayenne and coriander gave it a nice spicy taste. My hubby isn't a fan of stuffed peppers, but he loved this!  I didn't even waste time boiling the peppers, I baked this covered for 25 mins at 385 degrees, then uncovered for 10-15 mins. I poured some of the tom sauce and EVOO on the bottom of the dish, so the peppers didn't burn. They were nice and soft, not crunchy or mushy.  I doubled the meat/ingredients and had enough to put in a pan all by itself, after over filling my peppers. It was sooo good. It was good for those that don't like the peppers, or just want extra.

I gave this 5 star cuz it is an awesome place to start. I made stuffed green peppers with pre-fried hamburger before and we all thought they were disgusting. My dad always baked the meat mixture in the green peppers and his were amazing. So that is what I do. I used 5 peppers and calculated the recipe. I added onion,Worcestershire sauce about 2 -3 TBSP. ,garlic powder and onion powder. I eye balled these and the salt and pepper. I added 2C. of pre cooked minute rice and 2 eggs beaten. Mixed well. I cut the tops off the peppers and cleaned them out and stuffed them with the mixture. I did not pre cook the peppers. They do not need it. For the sauce I used a big can of tomato sauce and 1 1/2 cups of ketchup with made it awesome. I pored some on the bottom of the deep baking dish and then put the peppers in and poured the rest over the top and baked for 1.5 hrs. at 350. Amazing peppers almost as good as my dads. He passed away and I do not remember how to make them like he did. Thanks for helping with this recipe.

Wonderful!!  I tried making these w/o boiling peppers prior to cooking as some said they got too mushy - but next time I will boil them as I prefer my peppers soft instead of crunchy -- so this recipe was COMPLETELY spot on! Thanks

This is a great starter recipe. I happen to do my stuffed pepper slightly differntly. I do not brown my meat and I use instant rice. When I mix the raw ground beef I add 1 egg, some italian seasoning, a can of tomato paste, the uncooked instant rice and about 1/2 cup of water (to help with cooking the instant rice), I do blanche my peppers if I am making them in the oven, but if I stick them in the crock pot then I do not blanche them first. I stuff without packing firmly and then put any additional beef mixture around the peppers. Cover is 1/2 jar of your favorite chunky spaghetti sauce, cover with aluminum foil and bake about 1 1/2 hours @ 350. This is very moist since you are not browning the beef first. This is always a hit and cooks very well in the crock pot on low for 4-6 hours depending on the strength of your crock pot. Hope this helps anyone looking for a recipe without browing the ground beef first. Cheers!

I didn't even make this correctly and it turned out wonderfully. I didn't allow for enough sauce, so I topped it with a mix of ketchup, mustard and BBQ sauce. Then I didn't have mozarella cheese, so I used cheddar on top. My husband took one bite and said This is good! And I had to agree. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make this again and again.

Excellent! I, like many others, spiced it up substantially - I added 2 cloves of garlic and to the ground beef - while frying - added: cumin, coriander, garlic powder, S&P, chili powder, celery salt & dashes of worchester & soy sauces and then I added the garlic & onion. I used brown basmiti rice too and I didn't blanche the peppers - I added spaghetti sauc & water to the bottom of the pan.  A very tasty dish!!

DELISH!!!! I made these last night and my hubby gobbled up 2 of them in less than 5 minutes! lol, I tweaked the recipe a little by using spaghetti sauce (1 1/4 cups) to add a punch of flavor and a sprinkle of adobo seasoning from Goya. I didn't add as much cheese cause my hubbys not much on too much cheese but that's just personal preference.

I've been thinking of making stuffed peppers for awhile now, but never really got around to doing it until I found this recipe. It was super easy and the meat mixture was not bland at all (according to a previous review)! I added mushrooms to give the meat mixture more texture and added breadcrumbs and grated parmesan cheese to the mozzarella. I also put a layer of tomato sauce in the baking pan so the peppers wouldn't stick or burn.  It went excellent with a salad and some garlic bread :) Maybe the next time I make this, I'll add a Mexican spin to it, using salsa instead of tomato sauce and Spanish rice instead of plain rice...Thanks for posting!

Used red peppers. Next time I will not blanch (they were too soft for me). Used brown rice and only 1 lb of ground beef. Had filling for 3 LARGE peppers. Serving with mashed potatoes is a must. They compliment each other very well. I will make again but next time will use more spices in the hamburger before filling.  Update:  Made this again. Did not blanch the peppers (still used red) and added a small can (drained) of corn. Minced garlic in the hamburger and a little cumin. I used left over white rice this time. Think I prefer the brown but still very good. This has become one of our favorite meals.

Not an OMG thing, but good.  I used italian sausage instead of beef and a jar of pasta sauce instead of the can of tomato sauce.  Several people complained about blandness, so I think my changes took care of that.  Also, since I used sausage that is already fairly salty, I did not need to add extra salt.  And I did not top them with cheese just because I didn't want to.  Oh...and I did not bother pre-cooking the peppers.  I stuffed them raw and they turned out just fine.

Great filling for zucchini too!!! I made 1/2 times the filling ingredients called for so I could have extras to freeze.   I ended up with 8 pepper halves and 4 Zucchini halves.  All were very generously filled.  Like others here I did need to spice it up a little so used about a tbl of Penzeys sandwich sprinkle(which goes with EVERYTHING).   I did not parboil the peppers but I did slightly undercook my rice(brown)and I added a can of diced tomatoes with most of the liquid. Baked for 30 minutes under foil then I removed the foil topped with the cheese and baked another 15 minutes.  Perfect.  Even my very picky daughter liked the filled peppers but she LOVED the zucchini.  I liked the pepper verison better myself.  And as a bonus I have dinner in the freezer for another night.

I've made this recipe twice now.  I find that homemade sauce gives it much more flavor and I add to the taste.  I also, add chili powder which gives it a nice zing.  Overall, great meal!

My husband liked these a lot.  I thought they were pretty good.  I didn't precook the peppers since I like them to be more crisp than soggy.  I left out the pepper since my son is allergic, and I subbed a few cloves minced garlic for the garlic powder.  My peppers were organic ones from our csa and not as large as storebought peppers tend to be.  My husband ate 4 halves (I cut them like a boat because we find them easier to eat that way) and asked if there was any more filling left.  I had used the rest to freeze so we have a couple quick and easy meals for another time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I made several changes. I made the rice in the rice cooker and then added it to the beef. I added 1 cup of beef stock, 1 bay leaf and some cayenne and let it simmer while my peppers were blanching in the oven. DH said the rice/meat mixture needed something. Per his suggestion we added a generious handful of italian breadcrumbs...and what do you know...it really boosted the flavor. We topped with sauce and a mexican cheese blend then covered the skillet with foil & baked on 350 for 35 minutes (since I blanched peppers). DH said several times "that was so good". KEEPER!

Delish. I made a few alterations, I used a Mushroom based spaghetti sauce instead of the can of tomato sauce and added some crushed red pepper flakes. I cut my boil time & cook time in half the end result was a firmer green pepper which I prefer. I recommend trying this recipe.

Really good!  I substituted Prego for the sauce & seasonings.  I also followed the advice of another review and blanched the green peppers first (2 min. in boiling water) then baked for about 20 min.  I lightly sprayed the pan w/ cooking spray and put a few TBSP water in the bottom of the pan.  The green peppers turned out soft but not soggy.  The rice mixture tasted great.

These were great!  However, couple of suggestions-do not cook the peppers for 10 mins. unless you like them super soft (mushy).  Next time I will just blanch them for 2-3 mins.  Definitely double the sauce.  I added Italian seasoning to the sauce.  I had an Italian cheese blend (pizza blend) in the frig which I sprinkled on top and LOVED it!!

Terrific! This was a big hit with my husband. I've tried other stuffed pepper recipes and I'm always disappointed. This will be my "go to" recipe from now on. The only change I made was using spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Make using orzo cooked with chicken stock instead of rice; season beef with garlic, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, ample freshly ground black pepper and a touch of cumin powder. Use pasta sauce

These were delicious! I didn't change a thing. It did seem to make a lot more filling than the peppers could handle however. The tops got a little crispy so next time I might reduce the cooking time.

These were good, but could have used a little more oomph.  I think next time, I'll make them with sausage instead of ground beef, or maybe 1/2 and 1/2...but they were still good though.

I loved the addition of cheese.  I popped them in the microwave for 5 mintues then cooked for about 20 minutes in the oven.  I never know what to serve them with so I went with mashed potatoes as suggested.  Made for a nice hearty meal on a cool November evening!

Wow...this recipe is a lot of work! So many steps for what ends up just being a casserole. I think I'll stick with my own stuffed pepper recipe which uses raw rice, raw peppers, and raw beef and cooks everything in the oven (or crockpot). It is much easier and tastes better because all of the flavours mingle while cooking together.

This is a great recipe and my husband really loved it.  I blanched the peppers and baked them for roughly 40 minutes and they came out nicely done.  Instead of using tomato sauce in the beef mixture I used a can of tomato soup.

I made this tonight, it was pretty tasty but I changed it to match our dietary restrictions.  I didn't parboil the peppers, they baked just fine in the time I alloted them in the oven.    I used brown rice instead of white, about half a cup uncooked, ground turkey, and added a can of Rotel to the can of tomato sauce, and added some chopped fresh garlic.  I boiled the rice with 1 t of garlic powder in the water.  I used way less mozzarella (fat free)  and mixed in a bit of low fat parmesan.    The used of the ground turkey eliminated a large amount of fat in the bottom of the peppers.  I will make it again, probably change it everytime!  Great starter recipe.

I had extra peppers to use so I just cut off the tops and used eight peppers.  I like the idea of halving the peppers for times when I don’t have as many peppers on hand. I added a little crushed red pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served it for Mother’s Day dinner and it was enjoyed by all.  It also made a nice presentation.  It’s easy enough to prepare for a weeknight meal too.

Tasty! I only blanched the peppers (I like the crunch) and added cumin and coriander as one reviewer suggested.  Next time I will add more tomato sauce.   Thanks for a good recipe!

I knew this was not going to work for me, based on others reviewer’s comments and suggestions. Here’s what I did. 1. There’s no need to par-boil the peppers - save yourself the work! Once peppers are stuffed and in the baking pan, but prior to baking, add a cup of boiling water from your tea kettle, just pour it around the peppers (not on them!). The idea is to steam-soften the peppers while they cook. Cover with tin foil and bake for 30-40 minutes. Then, take the foil off, add Asiago (or medium sharp cheddar) cheese, and cook until melted and slightly browned. Use double the tomato sauce called for, and a little sugar to it (just a teaspoon or two), or, before filling peppers, put a ½ tsp apple jelly into the bottom of each, fill with rice mixture, and continue with steps. YUM!

This was really really good. I put the onions in first then added the hamburger.  I added lots of spices mentioned in other reviewers.  I blanched the peppers, they came out perfectly. In case you don't know how... boil water, add peppers, let sit for 3 minutes in a strong boil, then put them in cold water right away.  I used spaghetti sauce and cheddar, just cause that's what I had on hand oh and I did add a can of diced tomatoes and when I make them again, I will do it the same way!!

I love stuffed peppers, unfortunately my family does not.  With this recipe, I loved it, my wife loved it, my brother-in-law liked it much better than the other recipes and my son like everything but the bell peppers.  None of the 3 liked the other recipe posted on AllRecipes.com.

I reviewed the other reviews and changed some of the quanities and ingredients.  I cooked 2 cups of rice in a rice cooker.  I had 8 large bell peppers (kept whole), used 2.5 lbs of ground beef, 16 ounces of can tomato sauce, 15-16 ounces of can diced tomatoes, 15-16 ounces can corn and used only 1 cup of shredded cheese (since I didn't halve the peppers).  I boiled the whole peppers for 8 minutes and I didn't simmer the mixture for 10 mintues before stuffing.  Before I sprinkled the cheese, I added some ketchup to the top.

Next time I going to add some cumin and mix the rest of the cheese into the mixture.  I might halve the peppers next time because a whole one, although is nice for presentation, appears overwhelming.

This was a great recipe and it went over well.  I did add a few things to it to make the meat filling more flavorful:  taco seasoning, the suggested diced tomatoes, fresh garlic, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, and the tomato sauce in the bottom of the pan before baking.  I used Monterey Jack cheese for baking and sprinkled chedder cheese on top after baking.  I will make this recipe again, thanks for sharing!

I don't think this is the best recipe out there. Precook the rice then simmer with meat mix for another 10 minutes then bake for 45. Our rice was extremely overcooked. Waaayyyy to much mixture for 3 peppers and too much rice made it very bland. If you use this get another thing of sauce to smother the dry peppers. Find another recipe.

I decided to use pork chorizo in place of the ground beef and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Turned out delicious!! The chorizo definitely spiced things up, so I also added some sour cream to mine. Would definitely recommend!!!

These were delicious! I didn't boil the peppers either. I also added one fresh tomato, diced, to the meat mixture. I used italian seasoning in addition to the garlic powder and salt, and used spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. (It was all I had) It was sooo delicious with the cheesy top layer and the meat mixture was perfect. Not dry at all. The pepper was cooked very well. Overall we loved this and will definitely make again and again!

I made these for Christmas Eve.  They were a big hit.  I did use 4 large green peppers (there was a lot of rice mixture) and bought an extra can of tomato sauce (for dipping).  I will make these again very soon!!

This is a good basic pepper recipe, but I am giving it only 3 stars because of the stuffing to pepper ratio.  Wow... a pound and a half of meat to three stuffed peppers?  Those must be huge peppers!  This actually makes enough stuffing for closer to six average sized peppers, so just beware.  I also like using fresh garlic in mine and grated parmesan cheese on the top.  With only tomato sauce it lacked some flavor, and maybe a couple tablespoons of tomato paste could round it up a notch.  Otherwise a fairly good recipe and one that someone could add more things to.. like chiles, yum!

In reading the reviews I felt this recipe needed a lot of help.  I almost feel that I should just put a new recipe on and not bother rating this one; but here goes anyway.  I sauteed the onion in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, then added some fresh garlic (about 1 clove).  When that was soft but not brown, I added a cup of long cooking rice and 1 3/4 cups of chicken broth (adds so much flavor).  I cooked and then cooled some.  I then added this to the hamburger (raw).  Stirred about 2/3 of a 24 oz jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and mixed all together.  I also added pepper at this point.  (Didn't feel it needed salt because of the other additions).  Filled 3 peppers halved.   Place in a 9 x 13 dish and spooned the rest of the spag sauce on top.  I put a little water in the bottom of the dish so the peppers wouldn't burn.  Baked this at 325 for about 45 minutes covered, then uncovered and topped each with some mixed Italian Cheese.  Didn't measure, just a nice handful on each pepper.  I baked for an additional 20 minutes until the cheese was melted and starting to brown.  I realize that this has totally altered the original recipe but it was so good and really not that much work.  In fact I think this method was easier than the original. I just could see no reason to blanch peppers and double cook hamburger.  My baking time was a little longer but I wasn't in a hurry so it worked out great.  Smelled so good while baking and tasted so good when eating!!!

I have been making my stuffed bell peppers almost identical to this for 20 years.  The only thing I do different is to use a jar of Cheese Wiz as opposed to mozzarella or other shredded cheese.  In the oven, the Cheez Whiz melts into the meat and rice mixture very well and it is delicious.  I have to make this dish for my oldest son on his birthday every year.  It is his favorite.

VERY GOOD!! I'm glad I read the reviews first and added some flavor! It would have been very bland otherwise. I sauteed the onions with the meat and added minced garlic as well. I also seasoned the meat with cayenne peppper. I added some cheese into the mixture and then added some on top as the recipe calls for.

I tried Kelsey's recipe and it was great.  I did add more cheese and two jars of Classico Spicy Red Pepper Spaghetti sauce.  I added one jar to the mixture and one jar over the top after the cheese was melted.  Put it back in the oven for a few minutes to heat it up.  It was delicious.

did not read reviews & followed recipe exactly- felt it was a little dry & very bland-way to much filler for  only 3 green peppers-wasteful-if you use this
one make sure to add lots of seasoning & keep a reserve of sauce on hand

I thought this recipe was really delicious.  I made a few variations that I thought turned out really well.  Instead of groud beef, I used lean ground pork and I added in two chopped fresh jalapenos. I also added in a little more tomato sauce than originally called for.  It was great.  The only thing worth noting is that I had a TON of the  meat mixture left over.  I could have filled an additional 3 peppers easily.  Overall, really excellent and tasty; thanks for sharing.

My boyfriend had never had stuffed green peppers, I was craving them, but didn't have a recipe.  Good recipe, needs more seasoning.  I added an Italian seasoning and Garlic.  It still needed something though.  I also put it to 4 servings but needed 3 peppers.

I put the bell peppers into a 9x13 pan filled about half way with water in the microwave for about 5 minutes to soften them before filling.  I didn't cut them in half, instead I cut off the tops and this amount of filling filled 7 peppers for me.  I thought they'd be too dry so after filling, I seasoned up another 15 oz. can of tomato sauce with about a tsp. of brown sugar, some italian seasoning and more garlic powder and poured it over the top of the peppers before baking.  Melted the cheese over the top for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Everyone liked it.

My husband loves stuffed peppers.  This is a good starting point.  I added more garlic, basil, oregano and parmesean cheese and also substituted wild rice.  The peppers were very yummy.  I wonder if these freeze well.

We used vegetarian sausage instead of the ground beef, minute rice instead of regular, and added corn to the stuffing mixture.  They were phenomenal! My boyfriend who has a negative bias towards all foods vegetarian loved them.

I threw in a handfull of graded cheddar cheese, and it really added to the flavour.  A perfect recipe for either a fancy meal with friends, or a family get together with kids.

10 Thumbs up *literally*!!  Every person in my house who ate these really enjoyed them.  I changed the recipe slightly by using a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  The mozzerella cheese is really what separates these stuffed peppers from other recipes.  It was a very nice twist on a good old favorite.

I followed the recipe but instead of using white rice I used minute brown rice and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also used shredded cheddar and jack cheeze in place of the mozzerella and added italian seasoning to the ground beef mixture. It turned out great although next time i would love to try this with italian sausage!

My whole family loved these stuffed peppers. I followed the recipe with the exception of the cook time - we wanted our peppers to be a little firmer so I only baked them for 20 minutes.

Great recipe.  I only put the peppers in the boiling water for 5 minutes so they wouldn't be too tender.  Also sauteed onions, diced peppers and 3 cloves garlic to add a little more flavor.

This was an excellent recipe.  Based on some other reviews, I used Spaghetti Sauce instead of just tomato sauce.  My kids and I loved it.  It's on the list as a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  Used Zattarans Dirty Rice instead of white rice.  Added garlic, garlic salt and cumin.  Added a can of diced tomatoes.  Used ground turkey instead of beef.  Totally skipped boiling the peppers and just stuffed them and baked them covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes.  Perfection!

Awesome recipe.  Combined the first two readers suggestions and added chopped garlic to the rice while it cooked, then added these additional spices to the beef: chili powder, oregano, cayenne.  Accidentally added double the sauce and it still turned out great!

I was torn between giving this either two or three stars. I opted for three because of the possibilities for this recipe. As is, they are very bland, but simply adding more garlic powder is not the answer. I can't quite put my finger on what is needed, but something sure is. Maybe even changing to a different cheese would help. I'll update if I figure it out, but it won't be for awhile. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband loves stuffed peppers and this is a great recipe. I also blanched the peppers instead of boiling, added 1/2 tsp of oregeno and used minced garlic. Instead of making the rice separate, I browned hamburger and onions, added petit diced tomatos and water along with a Tbsp of worchester sauce and spices and then cooked the rice with the rest of the mixture for 20 minutes (covered). I used cheddar and motzerella cheese for something different.

I agree with what a few others have said...the original recipe is a little bland. But that might be good if you have children who do not like spicy food!  The second time I made this, I added in 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic to the rice when boiling and used 15 oz jar of pizza sauce when I realized I was out of tomato sauce. I also added a bit of cumin, and italian spices to the mix after it had simmered for 10 minutes.   Also, I mixed 2 cups of mexican shredded cheese into the meat mixture after I let it cool for about 2 minutes, then I spooned it into the pepers and baked for 30 minutes. Everyone loved it, and even my very picky 9 yr old said it was even better than the first time we had it.  I have a 2 and 3 yr old that are pretty picky about their food, and they even ate the peppers when the stuff inside was gone, that alone is worth an extra star to me!

Ok, so I made a lot of changes to this recipe as a matter of preference, and to use up some things in the freezer and fridge.  I used orzo instead of rice that I had already cooked and frozen.  I also had arrabiatta sauce in the freezer, so I used that instead of the can of tomato sauce, which added a nice little kick.  There was just a little shredded cheddar, so I threw that into the mix, along with a mozzarella/provolone blend.   I didn’t bother boiling the peppers first – just stuffed them raw, as I didn’t want them to get mushy.  My end result – GREAT!!  When I plated these I put a little pool of remaining arrabiatta sauce on the plate and topped it with the peppers.  Just goes to show that this is easily altered and still turns out great!

These stuffed peppers are delicious and so easy to prepare.  I love stuffed peppers, but had never tried to make them myself because I thought it would be complicated.  Then I found this recipe which seemed so simple, so I gave it a try.  I've made these twice now, and I'm amazed at how simple they are to prepare and how yummy they taste!  Try 'em, you'll love 'em!

This is a good basic recipe for stuffed green peppers.  It makes a good starting point and allows you to personalize the dish to your own taste.  I added some Italian seasoning and a little crushed red pepper flakes to the filling before stuffing the peppers.  I made the recipe for 4 servings, baked two of the stuffed peppers and froze the other two stuffed peppers.  I placed the pepper halves cut sides together so that it looked like one one big pepper half.  Then I filled them with the stuffing mixture, poured more tomatoe sauce over them, and sprinkled a little more Italian seasoning over top.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I served them with the suggested mashed potatoes and corn, topping the mashed potatoes with some of the excess tomato sauce as a gravy.  Yum!!!

This is a family favorite. Excellent with red peppers! I have even made a double batch and frozen it, peppers and all. Once I made too much of the mix for the peppers I had, so I just froze the meat and rice mixture in a freezer bag and thawed it out the next time I had peppers.

With a couple of alterations I really loved this recipe.  I used Hunt's Classic Italian Spaghetti Sauce, a 26.5 oz can. I used amost all of it in the stuffing but saved about a half cup to put in the bottom of the baking dish. I also used instant brown rice and turkey burger instead. I cooked it just the way the recipe called for and they turned out AMAZING! Definitely putting this one in the recipe box:)

These peppers were awesome!!! Delicious. I like the idea of cutting the peppers in half and stuffing them that way opposed to stuffing a whole pepper. I used green, yellow, orange and red! (I had a mixed bag)

Good starter recipe.  I didn't blanch peppers.  Added one whole chopped onion and fresh garlic to beef.  Also added a little cumin, chili powder, Worcestershire, and one extra 8 oz can of tomato sauce to beef.  Used wild rice instead of white.  (You can even cheat and use the "minute" brown and wild rice!)  Bake covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes.  So good!!

Awesome recipe!  My husband said it's probably his favorite food now. He LOVED it and so did my mom!  And even I did and I don't really like green peppers.    I changed a a few things:  I used brown rice instead of white rice and I added a can of diced tomatoes... wonderful! And I  didn't boil the peppers.  I put them in a dish and covered them with foil, baked 25 minutes and uncovered 15 minutes, then sprinkled the cheese on and cooked another 10 minutes!  Thanks so much for this FANTASTIC RECIPE!

Great Stuffed Peppers!  I used different colored peppers (made the presentation beautiful), used 2 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, added a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes, spooned a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce on top of the stuffed peppers before baking ... DELICIOUS ... it's a keeper!

Not bad...  First of all, with the amount of filling it makes, it should call for about 6 peppers, not 3.  The filling does need more flavor so I would add more spices next time.  I did add extra sauce and I'm glad I did because it would have been too dry for us.  I also blanched the peppers for about 3 minutes and cooked them once filled for about 30 and that was a good amount of time.  I used red peppers since I prefer them over green.  Sweeter and delicious!

These were really good. I did not have enough tomato sauce so I used one small can of tomato sauce, and  1 can of Rotel. The Rotel gave the dish some much needed flavor, I would highly recommend it.

Since I don't love the slight bitterness of green peppers I think I'd prefer a more dynamic filler. That said, this was very filling and good. Basic. I added garlis salt, black pepper, basic and Italian seasoning.

After reading the reviews from others I added chili pepper, sauted onions and garlic to the filling mix.  I also used spaghetti sauce w/ garden veggies.  It turned out pretty tasty with the additions.

My daughter and I loved these as is. My husband is not a big fan of green peppers so he usually would just scoop out the filling.  Last summer when we had an over abundance of tomatoes I had an idea. I hollowed out a few tomatoes and filled them for him. He loved it.

Awesome! I used red peppers (my kids hate the green ones)& added 1 small can of tomato paste. I think the red peppers gave it a slightly sweeter/less bitter taste, a real keeper!

Great recipe!  I tried it last night, and thought I was going to have to "doctor it up" with extra spices.  I didn't change a THING and this was a rare hit with ALL 5 FAMILY MEMBERS.  My husband, who's on a diet, told me he was sad he couldn't have another serving.  This from the man who won't eat spaghetti!  I did use quite a bit of garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  This is going in the "permanent" file for sure!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and I was a little skeptical.  In the words of my husband "Delicious!"  Did not change a thing and everything was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this!

I made this recipe according to the recipe except I added tomato paste to the tops. I did not halve the peppers, just cut the tops off, seeded them and stuffed the whole pepper. I added corn and cumin. We put them on the grill and they were delicious! I used 8 large whole bell peppers but had way too much mix left over but next time I'll just use more peppers and freeze the extras.

I love stuffed peppers (except the peppers LOL, I just eat the filling and enjoy the flavor it absorbed by cooking in a pepper!). I used 2 cups of dry Minute Rice instead of cooking regular rice separately. I just added a cup of water along with the tomato sauce to compensate. Stuffed peppers is one of my favorite do-ahead dinners. I make it the night before and my husband can stick it in the oven so I come home from work to dinner nearly ready! The mozzarella is a great addition, I never had it that way growing up but I love it!

This was pretty good.  Even got my picky 15 y/o to eat part of the bell pepper.  My son & I ate them up.  I did add a small can of diced tomatoes since it looked a little dry, along with some chile powder for a kick.

We really loved this recipe.  I do admit that I added a few ingredients to the filling to spice it up a bit.  I added garlic and some italian seasoning and lots of salt and pepper to it. The kids loved them too!

This recipe was pretty bland.  Boiling the peppers too long made the peppers more on the soggy side and I had too much meat left over.  Hence, boil less and use less meat if you want to make this.  I'm still on the hunt for a better stuffed pepper recipe.

We really enjoyed these.  I put some water in the pan before I baked them and that worked out well.  I'll be serving this to guests soon and I'll open another can of sauce (I used italian flavoured sauce) and heat it up to drizzle over the top before serving, and maybe sprinkle it with parmesan and parsley.  That should look and taste excellent!  Great recipe to springboard from.

My granddaughter and I made these and they were very good. I would recommend adding some extra garlic, or your choice of spices, as well as increasing the tomato sauce a bit. Otherwise, if you don't like spice, they are perfect as is.

I have made this recipe several time. To change it up sometime, I omit the cheese and mix 1 cup ketchup  and 1/4 cup brown sugar and pour over peppers after cooked and return to oven on broil to heat up.

My family loves this dish!  I use marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and I tried and liked the suggestion of using 1/2 t. cumin and coriander.  I also parboil the peppers for a few minutes in boiling water before filling and baking.  It comes out perfect every time!

These are good with some adjustments. I only boiled the peppers for a few minutes, then ran them under cold water. I also used half tomato sauce from a can and half homemade spaghetti sauce, plus some Worcestershire  in the meat mixture. I also added garlic to the rice water as another suggested.

Ok, I've made this a couple of times now. I thought it was too dry with just the 1 can of tomato sauce and a little bland for my personal taste.  I ended up putting the peppers in the oven to roast for maybe 5 min instead of boiling just because I didn't have room on my stove top and that worked just fine. Ended up baking 30 minutes and they were fine. The second time I used a full jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato.  Wasn't crazy about the flavor so next time I'll just use higher amt of tomato sauce. I spiced it up more with 3 cloves of garlic, pepper flakes, and some cayenne pepper.  I liked it with a little more heat but for kids would probably be better as written except for more tomato sauce. Will def make again.

Use a jar of marinara sauce and a can of undrained diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  Up the beef to 2 lbs.  Then you can freeze half the filling in a quart Ziploc bag and use it next time to make these really quickly.  Also you don't need to boil the peppers first.  Makes them nasty soggy and wastes time.

We've make this for years with very little changes but when we served it the kids would leave the peppers and eat the filling and ask for more??So we decided to chop the peppers into 1/4 " squares and turn it into the filling and prepare it that way, never had another picky kid complain about the peppers they were surprised when they asked for the recipe for their family and found that it had peppers in it!!!!!!!Go figure??? One change was we used medium Chedder instead of mozzarella, personal taste............

My family LOVES this recipe. It made enough to STUFF 4 large peppers, and still have 1/2 c of the filling to nibble on! (And, I only used 1 pound of ground beef!)

I did add 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 cap full of Tastefully Simple Onion Onion in place of the onion, and used 2- 8 ounce cans of sauce.

Microwaved peppers for several minutes before stuffing instead of boiling. Baked stuffed peppers for 20 minutes and then topped with slices of mozzarella cheese, browning for 5-10 additional minutes.

These were pretty good, they took a while to make so they are definitely not something you make when you are in a hurry. Pretty good, maybe not worth all the calories though.

Hello CHERYLH70. Thank you for this great recipe. I've made it several times, each time with a slightly different twist. I have found that 1 + 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef (I use ground turkey) is too much for only 3 large peppers. Instead I use 1 lb and double the number of peppers.  I also add Italian seasoning, fresh sliced or minced garlic and sometimes bottled Spicy Sicilian sauce. Cafe Martorano makes the best.  www.cafemartorano.com

Love this recipe, I did make a few changes, first I use minute rice to save time, I substitute Italian sausage for the ground beef. This adds a ton of flavor to the dish. I also add a can of itanlian chopped tomatoes and add a little cheese to the rice/meat mixture.

I thought these had a decent flavor but they were excellent as leftovers.  I've made them several times and my only complaint is that they are pretty dry when they come out of the oven.

This is a great recipe, but I definitely recommend reading the other reviews before preparing this - a lot of great suggestions! I found pouring a can of prepared tomato soup around the peppers before cooking to be one that especially helped. Also, after reading about how the recipe can be kind of bland, we substituted Zataran's Spanish Rice for white rice, which added some great flavor to the peppers. It is a great recipe, and one that someone can tweak easily to suit their own tastes.

here's a hint; if you use instant rice no need to cook first; just put it right in your stuffing mixture; big time saver!

I just made these stuffed peppers.  They were very good and as some other reviewers pointed out do not have enough flavor in the stuffing.  Next time I will add fresh garlic and more seasonings.  I also agree with other reviewers that it is overkill to boil the peppers and then bake another 45 minutes.  Overall it was a good easy meal to make and easy to customize.

I felt the filling needed additional sauce before being added to the peppers. Absolutely add your own preferred seasonings, as it is bland otherwise.

I jazzed this up a bit.  But the base recipe is a good one to work off of.  I put in some real garlic, parsley and basil along with garlic salt and pepper into the "stuffing" for the peppers.  Also, I did not pre cook the peppers.  Just put a can of tomato sauce in bottom of pan and cut peppers in half and they cooked perfectly.

I fixed these tonight EXACTLY as the recipe said. My husband is not one to compliment me on my cooking, but he is still raving over these stuffed peppers. They really were delicious. I highly recommend this recipe. I have it in my recipe box now and it looks like I am going to have to serve them again next week. Fantastic recipe!!! Thanks so much!!!

This recipe was very tasty, as I love stuffed peppers.  The only changes I would make would be to add more sauce and not cook for a full 45 min., I felt it was too dry.  I also did not blanch the peppers first and they came great!  I would make again.

My mother started making stuffed peppers this way 60 years ago except she never parboiled the peppers and after stuffing them she continued the cooking in a large sauce pan. Our sides were always corn and mashed potatoes also.

This was a success!  I did boil peppers, but I only baked them for 30 minutes.  TRUST ME that's all they need.  They turned out perfect - tender but not mushy.  I also added red pepper to the filling.

I think this is a good starting point recipe, but I made A LOT of changes: 1) I blanched the peppers first; 2) I browned the meat, then simmered it in vegetable stock with taco seasoning -- AWESOME flavor there; 3) I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup; 4) I layered the ingredients -- cheese, stuffing, cheese, stuffing; 5) added a lot more salt and pepper throughout the cooking process.

These were really good. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I didn't pre-cook the peppers since I made this to have on hand during the week and thought that the peppers would soften when reheated (which they did). I also tweaked the ground beef mixture and added chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, addeded pepper flakes and a tsp or two of sun dried tomato paste while it was cooking. I also halved the peppers lengthwise instead of just cutting off the the tops. Very good.. will make again and maybe experiment with the filling for different flavors.

This recipe was very tasty. My whole family loved it. I added diced tomatoes, italian seasoning, and mrs. dash to this. Also did not boil peppers, I added the diced tomato juice and a little water to the baking dish, covered and baked for 15 min. Removed cover and followed recipe cooking directions.

I boiled my peppers whole for about 5 min., cooled them before cutting in half lenthwise to clean and fill. They were so easy to clean and came out perfect! Great recipe! Thank you...

Fabulous! I added garlic when sauteing the onions, plus a mix of Italian spices. Only took 25 minutes of baking in the oven, plus 5 minutes with the added cheese.

Ok...I'm not even kidding, this is delish!  I've made them several times exactly as instructed, but this time, I didn't realize I didn't have a few things on hand so I had to improvise.  First, I used red instead of green peppers (which I prefer anyway), still tasted amazing.  Next, I was out of white rice so I subbed instant - WHOA- cut the prep-time in a major way!  Then, I realized I only had 1/4 of the sauce, so I incorporated a bit of boiled water swished around in the can of sauce and seasoned with some taco seasoning...just to moisten the meat/rice mixture.  In honor of the taco seasoning, I topped it all off with Tex-Mex shredded cheese and it was just perfect!  :)  Oh, I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce just 'cuz, and used a fresh garlic clove in addition to the garlic powder.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Did make some changes to make use of what I had on hand.  Used Wild rice blend and beef broth instead of the white rice and water.  Only other change was to add some mushrooms and saute them with the onion.  You'll be glad you tried this one!

These were good, my hubby enjoyed them, but I prefer a bread stuffing.  I did deviate from the recipe by frying the pepper after filling it and then baking it.  Just a matter of preference.

This recipe was so delicious!!  The stuffing was absolutely wonderful!  I used less rice, added some diced tomatoes, and didn't pre cook the green peppers.  Half way through I poured some leftover tomato juice from the diced tomato can into the baking dish to help cook the green peppers a little more, and it came out wonderful (I also used foil for half the baking time then removed)!!  Will definetly make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe, I agree with Bond 007, 2005, suggestions. My adaptions: brown rice, 6 whole red peppers (slice off the top, and with knife, even the bottoms so they sit up straight in dish) and ground turkey (not breast only, too lean) brown well, add olive oil if too lean and to enhance flavor. AND add whole Fennel, this really makes the recipe great.

A basic stuffed green pepper recipe that is very good.  I like that the peppers are halved and not left whole.  Usually a whole pepper is too much.  These stuffed peppers, though, disappeared the night I had them for dinner and there were just 3 of us.

This is a great meal.  My 4 year old claims it as her "favorite".  The only things that I did different was cook the beef with the onions and added a can of diced tomatoes (love tomatoes!). I see in another comment to cook the rice with the garlic - sounds like a good idea to try!

These were really good! I made brown rice instead of white and used veggie ground beef instead of regular. I sauteed some onion and garlic then added jalapeño, 1/2 a zucchini and a handful of mushrooms,  then I added in the veggie meat (I added in basil, oregano, parsley to season also). I then followed the steps basically as stated. I put the peppers in the oven for 25 mins. I served them with buttermilk mashed potatoes and a simple garden salad with balsamic vinegar. Will make these again, great vegetarian dish!

PLEASE...When people post recipes, please make sure they are accurate!  After reading reviews of too much filling for this recipe, I cut down the ground beef to 1 1/4 lbs and rice by a quarter.  I still had WAY TOO MUCH filling.  If you follow this recipe, you might as well buy five or six green peppers so all filling will be used up.

And boil the peppers for about five minutes, otherwise peppers are overdone.

Other than the mushy green peppers, recipe was okay.

Excellent recipe....for me after I did some tweaking.  I used instant rice to save time and forgo step 1.  I also blanched the peppers for 5 minutes in boiling water then plunged them into cold water to stop them from cooking.  Added 1 can diced tomatoes and 1/2 t. of coriander, cumin and several dashes of cayenne pepper plus fresh garlic(per other reviewer's suggestions)and it came out very tasty!  Season and taste as you go! I also added diced celery along with the onions because we like more crunch in our peppers.  I only had to bake them for 20 minutes because of blanching the peppers. Piled cheddar cheese on top after 10 minutes.  Mashed potatoes are excellent with these peppers!  Thanks for a good basic recipe, Cheryl! 
Sorry I made so many changes but isn't that what it's all about...making each recipe your own?

Very good!  I tweaked it a bit and made it more Italian style by using 1 jar spaghetti sauce.  First I cooked the meat & onions seasoned with salt & pepper, then added 1/2tsp crushed garlic and cooked for 1 more min.  I put 2/3 jar of the spaghetti sauce in the meat mixture and added 1/2c grated parmesian cheese.  There is enought meat to fill 5-6 peppers, and I just blanched them for about 5 minutes so they were green and crisp.  I covered the bells with the remaining sauce and topped with more parmesian.  Mozarella would be a good topper still, but I thought it would have been a bit overkill.  They turned out great and flavorful, even my 2 & 4 year old ate them up!!

I took the advice of the person whose review has been deemed "most helpful," and really like the recipe with those additions. I think the recipe would be sort of bland without adding cumin, red pepper, and coriander seed.   The addition of those spices (I used garlic powder as well) gives the filling a sort of sloppy joe taste, which my husband and I really enjoyed.  If that's not the right taste for you, I still think experimenting with spices would help the recipe.

I also added some cheese to the rice and beef mixture, in addition to topping the peppers with cheese.  Finally, we were using homegrown peppers, which seem to be quite a bit smaller than those you can buy at the grocery store, so I only parboiled the peppers for about 3-4 minutes, and I baked the peppers for 25 minutes, then added cheese and put them back in for another 6-7 minutes.  The texture came out perfect.

This recipe turned out great!  It made enough stuffing for 10 halves, rather than 6.  I also used red peppers and topped them with a 16oz. can of seasoned chopped tomatoes and it added great flavor.

Loved this recipe!  We do like our peppers a bit more crisp, next time I will blanch mine for 6 to 7 minutes vs. 10. Thanks for sharing!

These were awesome.  Used red peppers because they're in season and on special (why not?) and steamed them instead.  In order to boost flavour I cooked the rice in veggie broth.  Made this dish vegetarian and substituted ground beef for veggie ground beef (tastes the same without the fat).  I sauteed the  onions with two large cloves of minced garlic.  I added the veg meat and instead of tomato sauce I added a 24 oz jar of good italian marinara sauce.   Added a bit of cumin.  They only need about a half hour to be fully cooked.  Also, the stuffing makes A LOT.  I used maybe just over half of the mixture for 8 pepper halfs...the rest will go in the freezer!

everyone loved this recipe!! the only things I did different were that I added sauce to the mix before stuffing the peppers, and I topped it with feta cheese instead of mozzarella. It was an instant hit.

This was wonderful! We just got through eating this for supper. There were only a few things different that I did that the recipe did not call for. I sauteed onions (1 LG), 2 small chopped green bell peppers, and about three teaspoons of pressed garlic. I added two cups of parmesan cheese, and 1 Tablespoon of wos (however you spell it) sauce. I mixed it real good and baked them on 350 for 1 hour instead of boiling them first. I also used garden yellow squash that I let grow REALLY big and cut them in half and hollowed out the center and stuffed them as well. I topped with cheese and broiled until bubbly and browned. Everyone went on and on about this recipe. Thanks for a great base recipe!

I loved these. My husband who is not crazy about peppers .. did not. I blanched the peppers and they were still crisp after baking for 45 m. on 375. I used fresh onion and garlic and a 26 oz can of traditional spaghetti sauce.

Great!  I've been cooking the same recipe for stuffed bell peppers since my mom taught me as a child.  I didn't think I would like this at all, but my husband and I loved it!  Next time I will try adding some diced tomatoes for a similar texture to my mom's recipe.

I really liked this recipe, but I felt that the filling needed a little more spice, so I added chili powder and crushed red pepper. I also blanched the peppers instead of boiling them.

This was pretty good, but it would have been bland had I not taken the advice of several reviewers.  I added some spices and worcestershire sauce.  The mozzarella was a nice touch.  I also blanched the peppers instead of boiling for 10 minutes.  That worked very well - the peppers weren't too soggy and yet everything was done in 25 minutes.  A good basic recipe with lots of possibilities.  Could easily be given an Italian or a Mexican flair.

By far and above the best stuffed green pepper recipe I've found so far!  Nothing fussy, quick enough to make on a weeknight, and no hassle to prepare considering I almost always have these ingredients on hand.  The recipe ended up making more filling than I could put into the peppers, but it's quite tasty all on its own.
I substituted 1 cup uncooked bulgur wheat for the rice in this recipe to give the filling a better "bite" (rice fillings can sometimes get mushy, IMO), and added some dried red pepper flakes  dried oregano and a generous pinch of ground black pepper to spice it up.

VERY YUMMY!!! I used brown rice instead of white. I added several cloves of minced garlic, onion powder, and dried thyme and only 1 8oz can of tomato sauce.
I accidentally dumped a bunch of the thyme in, but it turned out great!!  And I think it could have used another can of tomato sauce, but it was still YUMMY!!! And also I only cooked it for about 30 minutes.

This is a good recipie to use as a base.  I took a lot of the advice of the previous reviewers.  Do NOT parboil the peppers first- they were plenty cooked after stuffing them raw and baking for only 20 minutes. (NOT 45!)  Also, I added 1 cup of frozen corn kernels, 1 tbs cumin, 2 tbs sour cream, and 1/4 c shredded pepper jack cheese in step 4.  Without these additions, they are VERY bland.  This mix stuffed 6 large peppers with pleny leftover to eat on bread. Oh- and I subbed ground turkey for beef. No one could tell.

This came out way over cooked for me.  The only thing I will precook next try will be the rice.  Also needs more spices, maybe Rotel tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I will use a small can of tomato sauce and mix in a tablespoon of brown sugar to top the whole stuffed pepper with before adding the cheese.

Very mild and filling. Next time, I would probably spice them up considerably with some minced garlic, Italian seasononing and shredded pepper jack cheese.  But as is, its a nice mild dish - very easy to prepare and makes good lunch leftovers.

These peppers were really good.  Just make sure that you have really large peppers.  I used medium peppers and had half the stuffing and cheese left!  Otherwise, it was great!

Made this recipe tonight and did not find it tasty it was rather bland and I did not cook either the meat or the peppers beforehand as a whole meatloaf will cook in an hour and this took all told 55 min.  The meat and the peppers were cook to perfection but still did not have the taste to be a keeper.  Sorry try again

I agree with everyone, this is a good recipe. I substituted and used ground turkey istead. Delicious! I will definitely make again, and it was just as good as leftovers.

We really enjoy this for dinner, however, I have made several changes to the original recipe.  I leave out the rice (we just don't like rice and it only serves as a filler anyway).  I use more meat and spice it up quite a bit.  Sometimes I make it more Mexican with chili powder, cumin, a touch of hot pepper, etc. and monteray jack cheese.  Other times I stick with more of the original but use more herbs, fresh garlic and onion.  You can pretty much use what ever flavors you like.  This is a great base to build on.

Not very flavourful, it needed extra spices and extra vegetables.  Corn and/or carrots would work.

These were great, my favorite stuffed pepper recipe.  I loved that there aren't a lot of ingredients, and they were easy to make.  They were moist and very flavorful - a keeper!

I will be making this again.  I would make a few changes.  The meat mixture needs a little more seasoning.  I will add some garlic powder and seaon salt.  I am also going to sprinkle a little sugar over the tomato gravy.

This is the first time I have made stuffed peppers i had a ton of them in my garden so I thought this was a good way to use them up. i was looking for an easy recipe and came across this one so I gave it a shot. They were a hit! I went step by step the only thing I did different is I had some home made spaghetti sauce to use up. i used a lot of garlic powder and I did not find them bland at all. They came out delicious!! I will be making this again the only thing I will do different is not boiling the peppers first only because I like peppers more hard then soft

The only changes I made were.  I saved the cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking and used a Monterey Jack blend in place of Mozzarella.  Delicious.  Make lots it's even better reheated the next day.

I did make it! I did use the recipe as a guide. It was a wonderful start. Forgive me I always tweek for my tastebuds. I added Frank's Hot Sauce seasoning and red pepper flakes. The peppers were a hit. There were no leftovers. Maybe next time I make them I will follow the recipe. I'll see  if I can send the picture of my finished product. They were so good.

Good starter recipe. I upped the tomato sauce by double and added ground Italian sausage to the hamburger and rice mix . added nice flavor . I did not parboil the peppers, and they stood fine , and cameout tender.  all in all a good basic recipe that can be adjusted to meet taste.

My husband is not a big green pepper eater but he sure loves this one. The 2 things that I changed was the rice as I didn't have any plain rice but I did have some Uncle Bens Spanish rice and instead of green pepper I used an orange pepper it has a sweeter taste and that is a good thing when one doesn't like peppers to begin with. We really like the flavor and is so easy to make and well if you have any of the filling left its really good heated up the next day with a salad.

I have been looking for a good wholesome  stuffed pepper recipe for a while.  I remember it tasting like this as a child growing up.  I found I didn't have any tomato sauce so I pureed some diced tomatoes and it was fine.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dinner.

I took the advice from others. Added chili powder for our taste and I didn't cook the peppers prior to the oven. Baked for 35-40 minutes.

These were really good, but could have used a little more flavor. I did add fresh garlic, some carrots, a little celery and the diced onion. Next time I will read the reviews and get other ideas for more flavor. But they were good and my family really liked them.

This version is really good. It is so good that I'm makingthem again this week. Normally I make stuffed peppers once or twice per month but these we so good that I'll be making them two consecutive weeks in a row. When I make a recipe for the first time I feel it is imperative to follow the directions implicitly.  It is an awesome recipe. I will tell you that I did make some notes as I made this and have come up with my own version which I've tried on my family and have posted here. I'm waiting for it to be approved. If you like stuffed green peppers then I think you'll like my version also - Savory Stuffed Green Peppers.

Im newer at cooking other than grilling but I think these turned out pretty darned good. I'm on a low salt/low potassium diet so by skipping the salt and adding a little red wine and extra garlic, it fit my requirements and had great flavor. 

p.s. I cheated a bit on the salt and substituted CHEDDAR! ...mmm...

My family really liked it, but I did make two changes. When I was looking for the tomato sauce in the pantry, I found a can of pizza sauce. It gave it a real Italian flavor. 
I cut the rice in half. When I added it to the meat it just looked like way too much so I removed a cup of the rice before stirring it into the mixture. 
The cooking directions were easy to follow and we enjoyed this a lot.

This is a great foundation. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and cooked the rice with a can of diced tomatoes to give it more flavor.

Please note: the recipe is SERIOUS about LARGE bell peppers. I used three small to medium-sized peppers, used only 1 lb of ground beef (the recipe calls for 1 1/2 lbs) and had enough stuffing to fill about two additional peppers.

Overall, the dinner was delicious after a few small tweaks. I browned the ground beef with a little bit of Worcestershire sauce, used a lot more garlic powder than the recipe called for, and sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Next time, I'll be sure to add some cayenne pepper into the mixture, since the mixture is a little less-than-seasoned, when following the recipe (kid friendly, that way?). Either way: this one's worth trying!

I decided to try this recipe because my husband loves stuffed peppers. I took other reviewers advice. I did not boil the peppers. The mix seemed a little dry with the rice. My husband likes spicy food. I added a 5.5 ounce can of spicy V8 and 1 1/2 teaspoon of "slap your momma" seasoning. Then finished per the recipe. He loved it! I will definitely make this again. Thank You for the recipe.

These were GREAT...my company LOVED them!! I made a couple of changes with what I had on hand. I used 5 medium green peppers cut in half and seeded; par boiled for 5 minutes. I only had 1 lb of hamburger, so I added a bit of extra rice. Added a couple of dashes of hot sauce to give it a bit of a kick...but not too much. Topped with a pizza blend grated cheese. Will definitely make this again! PS: high altitude baked at 360 degrees for 30 minutes, added cheese and baked an additional 10.

This was delicious! I did make some changes. I think if you go by your own tastes for seasons it would be perfect just for you and your family. I actually accidentally brought ground chicken instead of ground turkey and it was still really good, mixed with my own seasonings and I used mild cheddar cheese because I didn't have any mozzarella.

This is a keeper per hubby.  I hadn't fixed stuffed peppers in a while and these were very good.  Next time I will use mozzarella cheese instead of mild cheddar.  Leftover filling looks promising for hard/soft taco filling plus sour cream or burritos. Will definitely make again.  5/1/2015

I tweaked this recipe  a bit by also adding ketchup and extra garlic powder. I also cut the peppers in half length-wise and microwaved in a shallow pan w some water for 4 mins to soften a bit before filling with chopmeat mixture.I then baked as written for 30 mins.YUMMY ;))

Great recipe. I like to blanch the peppers beforehand in boiling water for about 15-20 minutes.  I make this healthier by using quinoa instead of white rice, ground turkey OR lean meat, & spaghetti sauce (Dei Fratelli). I also use fresh garlic and add cooked red/orange peppers to the rice/meat/sauce mixture for extra veggies.  I top the green peppers with tomato paste or sauce. I make a big batch of the rice/meat/sauce mixture so after filling the peppers I put the leftover mixture around the peppers & bake. voilà!

I did the Green peppers whole, so the inside mix was way too much for just the peppers--I would halve it next time if you didn't want the extra.  I just put the extra into the baking pan and it held the peppers up and was also great for my meat loving boyfriend. I only used 1.25 lbs of ground beef.  Also I added Kelsey's corn side into the mixture--I used 2 cobs of corn.  I replaced the tomato sauce with salsa.  It is an awesome recipe that you can tweak so many ways!

You will need to taste the filling and add or change as needed.  You can stuff a pepper with anything, so I added some oregano and basil, extra salt and pepper.  I ended up draining diced tomatoes instead of sauce because I didn't have sauce.  I mixed some mozarella into the filling instead of just on top.  I only boiled the peppers for a few minutes then dropped them in cold water to stop the cooking.  Baking them for 30 minutes was plenty to cook the pepper all the way through.  You will also want to make sure to not over-cook the rice.  I boiled it just until done, mixed it with the rest of the filling but didn't cook it another 10 minutes.  I just filled the peppers and baked-- which was plenty of time.

I added two cloves of garlic and used garlic powder to taste. Also added a bit more pasta sauce and a little less rice and ground beef. I also followed the advice of others and cooked for 20 minutes but then broiled the peppers for about 5-7 minutes until the cheese was slightly browned and melted. It was perfect this time around!! Without these changes,  I would give it four stars.

We loved this recipe! The filling didn't seem to have enough flavor so I did make a few changes; I grind my own beef, used petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and added Louisiana hot sauce. (about 2 tablespoons, or to desired taste)

I had to add more spices since the filling was bland.  I didnt cook the peppers first, so it took mine a lot longer in the oven than the recipe states.

This was very good.  I added some salsa and canned diced tomatoes to my own sauce.  I used cheddar and mozzerella.  I let all of that simmer for awhile, so the flavors melded.

What a great, basic recipe- I didn't find it to be bland at all. People who want more powerful flavors should simply add more spices. Delicious peppers and good leftovers, too. I served them with sourdough garlic bread. Thanks!!

I used 3 medium sized peppers so i reduce the filling slightly. Using 1lb of meat and maybe 2/3 cup of rice. I kept the amount of tomato sauce the same. It barely covered the meat and rice so i didn't simmer the mixture. It is really bland mix. I put a ton of spices in, (salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and chili powder) I just couldn't get it season enough for myself. My bf don't care for stuffed peppers to begin with thought it was good.

This recipe has potential but needs changes. I ended up w/ about double the filling I needed and my peppers were big and I didn't even use all the rice. Next time I'll use 1/4c of rice and about 3/4c beef.

Yum! I made per the recipe except I added a little Italian seasoning. Turned out great. I've also successfully tried variations like pre-baking the peppers instead of boiling, and skipping the ground beef for a veggie version. If you do skip the beef, double the rice or add a can of beans to make up the extra volume.

This is a good recipe for stuffed green peppers, but it can be a little bland as well as a little dry after it has had time to sit.  I added a little cumin and smoky mesquite seasoning for flavor and then poured a can of prepared tomato soup around the peppers before cooking to help with the dryness.  The soup helped the flavor as well.

I followed this recipe and didnt change anything. My fiance, our son, and two best friend LOVED it! I was so happy to make something so delicious that everyone enjoyed. One of my best friends doesnt eat bell pepper but ate this. My son ate the stuffing and really really enjoyed it. He asked for second. I made with mashed pototoes and corn.

very bland!  I have tasted much better but was hoping for something different from this recipe because of the pre-cooked rice, compared to raw rice, but it failed to deliver!!

Good but I agree with other reviewers kind of bland and they need more flavor. I will make again just adding more spice.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I had to use turkey as hubby can't eat ground beef, and I followed your directions to the letter, mmmmmm soooo good, we had fresh bell peppers from the garden and they were outstanding, my son don't like bell peppers so he just ate the stuffing and said it was off the hook! (what ever that means!) Thanks Kelsey!

The version I wound up with wasn't bad, but it strayed from the original.  I used a little less meat and rice (because that's what I had on hand), and used a jar of pasta sauce from TJ instead of tomato sauce.  I blanched the pepper halves (dropped in boiling water for 5 minutes), and baked the stuffed peppers for only 30 minutes (plus about 5 more after adding cheese).  The result was tasty, and I'll probably make this again.

Love, love, love these! I sub ground beef for soy crumbles and they are just as delicious. I make these often for my family. I've also used a salsa/tomato sauce combination for an added kick.

This was a fabulous recipe! I did tweak it a little bit. I added garlic powder to the water that I boiled for my rice. It added a hint of garlic without overpowering the whole recipe. I chopped my onion and cooked that with my ground beef. As far as seasoning, I used greek seasoning, red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning. I did parboil  my peppers for about 7 minutes, removed them from the water and let them cool before I stuffed them. After stuffing them, I cooked them for about 35 minutes and checked them and they were perfect! I topped them with cheddar jack cheese and browned the cheese! It is now a new favorite of my fiancee :)

One Suggestion I have is to parboil the peppers, then use some of that water to cook the rice. It will add flavor.

This is the best recipe I've found for stuffed peppers.  The only thing I did different is I used red peppers instead of green peppers and ground turkey (the good kind) instead of ground beef.  My family loves this recipe!

These were very good.  I've never cooked the meat before assembling the stuffed pepper and never put cheese in them.  I made these peppers and froze them. Since they went from the freezer to the oven without thawing, I should have blanched the peppers.  My husband and I ate all but one half a pepper.

Very good! I used brown rice instead of regular for a little bit healthier option. I also baked them in chicken broth for a little more flavor. I ended up using a little more tomato sauce for a little more moistness.

I thought these were pretty good, though they were definitely lacking in spice just a bit.  I didn't bother boiling my peppers, as we like them somewhat firm anyway, and I added garlic salt, cumin, basil and cayenne to the hamburger and onions as I sauteed.  They were pretty good, and my family enjoyed them.

I did take previous reviewers suggestions and boiled the peppers.  I wanted mine a little more saucy so I added another can of tomato sauce.  Overall, these were pretty tasty.

These were good, I've never made stuffed peppers before...I took the advice of others & didn't cook the peppers before baking(I should have) I also added a can of diced tomatoes & used fresh garlic..also added some chili powder. Overall good flavor and next time i will blanch the peppers first.

I made these today. They are wonderful! I tasted one & put the other 5 in the freezer as I made them for my relatives who are coming next week. I made them with ground turkey . I did tweak them with seasonings & etc. Will make them often.

These were pretty good.  Stuffed peppers aren't my favorite thing, but hubby loves them, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I used suggestions made by luv2cook and they turned out really well.  Definately add some cumin and red pepper flakes.  If you like them really tender, increase your baking time.  I found no need to blanch them first.  I also used lots of cheese--colby inside and mozzarella on top.

Very tasty! I made a few changes. I blanched red peppers rather than boiling green. I also used brown rice instead of white and I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper to the mix. As suggested I added an additional 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce I had and it made the filling just the  right consistency. Excellent!

I would rate it as a 4, my hubby gave it a 3.  I like the meat mixture but only after I doctored it a bit.  Added in a can of diced tomatoes and some red pepper flakes, about a teaspoonful.  It was ok but for some reason it had a sour taste to it.  I think it was probably the canned tomato sauce.  Maybe I'll make my own next time or possibly even use spaghetti sauce.  I dunno but this needs tweaking before we'll make it again.

After making these peppers once my husband requested them a second time!  I tweaked the recipe a bit the second time to put a bit more flavour in the filling, I added a bayleaf to the cooking water for the rice which added a nice base flavour, I added a bit of chopped jalapeno to the hamburger mix and I used real garlic finely minced instead of the powder.  Lastly, the filling mix was a bit dry so I added some of the water used to boil the peppers to loosen it up a bit.  Yummy! These aren't big changes but the made the difference from good stuffed peppers to great!

After reading other reviews, I also par-boiled the peppers, used turkey hamburger and added some Italian spices, along with crushed fennel. I did have extra stuffing left over, but it's also good by itself.  Thanks for sharing.

Sooo Yummy.. I used brown rice and did as a previous reviewer suggested and added 1/2 ts of cumin and corriander each.  I also added crushed tomatoes to give it more sauce.  They were perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband is always very weary on my cooking...As am I!!! That said, He and my mother in law just raved about these. They were absolutly delicious.  I had some spaguetti sauce left over in the fridge and decided to use that, I mixed it in with the rice and added salt, pepper and chili powder to taste. Then a handful of mozzarella cheese to the rice as well and stirred it in. I baked them for approx 20 to 25 minutes.  I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of them and baked for 6 minutes.  They came out delicious.

A great recipe--kids really loved it, too. I made it exactly to the recipe here. It might be better with more tomato sauce, but that is a personal preference.

Yummy!  I've always made these but without the cheese, we like the added cheese.  I didn't need to cook mine for 45 minutes - they were ready in 25 minutes.  I added cheese and let it settle for 5 minutes, then added MORE cheese and let that melt/settle for 10 minutes in oven - very yummy and cheesy!  I used Kraft Italian 5 Cheese - shredded because that it what I had on hand.

These were phenomenal! I blanched the peppers and stuffed them, and then added an extra can of tomato sauce on top. I ended up with enough filling for about six peppers, so next time I'll get more peppers or cut the recipe in half. Excellent!

We all enjoyed this recipe, even my 6 and 13 year old children. I did make a few changes to make it healthier: I substituted a ground vegetable beef mix for half the ground beef (no one in the family even notices). I used red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green. I used fresh garlic (crushed and sauteed with the beef mixture) in place of powder. I added 1 tsp. Worcester sauce. And I used a shredded light cheese mox instead of straigh mozzarella. Hope these ideas are helpful!!
Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe, and so does the rest of my picky-eating family. I find now that I've made them a few times, I don't even pay attention to the amount of spices I use, I just add and taste as I go. Wonderful, easy recipe to follow, especially if you hate cooking like I do *lol*.

I made this last night.  Even my daughter enjoyed it.  I did follow the suggestions made by Bond007.  It had a lot of flavor, and the peppers were still firm enough to enjoy.  A definite keeper!

Didn't like the harsh italian flavor.  It was kind of boring.  I tried this recipe again and the next time I adjusted the sauce to more of a meatloaf sauce...sweeter.  I used brown sugar, lemon juice.  However, my husband liked the original recipe.  I just didn't.

I love this recipe. We invited a freind for dinner and He and my fiance both were in Awe. Of course I changed it up some becuase I just cant seem to ever follow a recipe. I roasted some garlic in the oven and used that with my onions. Also, used a little Rotel with the tomoato sauce for a kick. 

Its a keeper, thanks!

I made these peppers yesterday because I needed something that I could put in the oven during my daughter's ballet class.  I put everything together and put it in the oven.  I set the oven to start while we were gone and we arrived home to an almost complete dinner!  I had just enough time to add the cheese.  My husband said that we should put this recipe into the "rotation." I also have enough leftover for dinner tonight. Yummy.

Very Good! My husband said it reminded him of his grandmothers. Added Cheese to the bottom of peppers as well as the top. Felt it needed a little more flavor to it, but still they were good. May add fresh mushrooms next time.

Very good Cheryl and family loved the addition of the cheese. I think of this dish as a winter thing, but because I haven't made it in so long I knew the gang would be happy. I used ground turkey and yellow rice with this for no particular reason other than I happened to have it on hand. Added a few more seasonings and some liquid to the bottom of the pan. Healthy and true comfort food. Thank you!

LOVED IT. Very easy, I did change a few things. I cut the tomato sauce to an 8oz can, added 3 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, and used only 1/2 the rice.Oh and a whole large clove of garlic. You should give this one a try....YUMMY!!

I made this last night and it was superb.  I even served them was garlic mashed potatoes and corn, it was a hit!  I did add chili powder and some extra cumin.  I did not boil the peppers but I did blanch them.  They cooked nicely in 25 minutes!  The cheese was wonderful, and I did add some tomato paste before I put the cheese on top.

Even following some other reviewers suggestions I found this to be somewhat bland.  I will try again but will add far more spices.  It's a good basic starter recipe.

Really good & easy.  Added a can of beef broth to the tomato sauce, also used some leftover marinara sauce too.  Spiced it up with some grill seasoning, Italian herbs, extra garlic, & worcestershire.  Liked the addition of cheese.

this recipe was really bland, but other than that it was good. my family loved it after we added a lot of salt. we didn't need to cook it for the full 45 minutes. it only took 20 minutes.

i enjoyed this recipe overall. i dont usually make them this way, but i tried cutting them in half and using mozzarella. it definitely cut down on time. you might try adding minced jalapeno peppers to add a little kick. yum!

I tried to do this in my slow cooker (because I don't have an oven).  I cooked it WAY too long.  I precooked the meat and the rice.  I added fresh garlic and some Korean pepper powder.  The green peppers were mush (beyond!), but the rest was good (just a bit soggy).  When I make this next time, besides cooking it for half the time I did (since that wasn't in the recipe I won't bore you with cooking details),  I won't precook the rice.  I think it would come out a bit firmer, and not so soggy.

Just like Mom used to make! Well, she still does, too.... I don't pre-cook the meat, though. I have also stuffed tomatoes in the same pan for my brother who doesn't like peppers.

This was good but I modified the recipe a bit -- added some Tony's Creole seasoning and used less tomato sauce.  I didn't have any on hand, but I think it could be improved by adding corn and some minced garlic.  I also only baked it for 20 minutes, and topped with both cheddar and mozzarella cheese.

Great recipe for stuffed peppers.  Added fresh garlic instead of the powdered and a little more salt and pepper.  Instead of ground beef, used ground venison.  My husband loved it.  Didn't have the mozzarella, but used cheddar which I had on hand.  I will make this again.  Thanks Cheryl.
