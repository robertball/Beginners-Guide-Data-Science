Hmmm...wasn't too keen on this based on the original recipe - way too cheesy for me - I ended up using only 1 8oz package of cream cheese, but 1 pound of smoked salmon (1/2 whipped into the cream cheese to turn it pink, half chopped and folded in) and used 4 tsp worcestershire sauce and 3 tsp hot pepper sauce, and then added juice of 1/2 a lemon.  Also used 5 chopped green onions.  Then it was pretty good!

I just made this for a party and several people really raved about it and wanted the recipe. Easy to make, too! I doubled the worcestershire and hot pepper sauce. Also, I didn't have fresh dill or green onion, so I used dried dill and dehydrated onion flakes. Thanks for this recipe!

This is yummy.  We had it on bagels for dinner tonight.  I used a little dried dill instead of fresh and red onion.  I doubled the onion. I also added a little minced caper. Dinner included a side of fresh asparagus that was blanched and chilled and sprinkled with olive oil, lemon and salt and pepper.  Tasty and quick meal.

As someone who loves lox and cream cheese, I think this recipe is superb!  Had all the ingredients on hand and whipped it up in no time.  I'll be making this for my friends for sure.

Pretty good.  Served it with toasted sourdough cocktail bread.  Next time I'll add chives and maybe just a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Needed a tad more zing.  But it was very good.  Here's a hint to make chopping the  smoked salmon easier:  Use a large pizza cutter.  VERY easy and the salmon doesn't slide around the cutting board like it does when you use a knife.  Easy and quick.

Made this with some lemon/dill smoked salmon we brought back from Alaska.  Was gobbled up at my New Year's Eve party.  Great presentation, super easy and delicious.  A definite keeper.

I liked this, but my family did'nt care for it much...they thought the salmon was a little overpowering despite the smoked flavor.

This recipe is great as is but I combined it with another and loved the results.  I thinned out the cream cheese with 1/2 cup heavy cream, added 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 clove minced garlic, a little horseradish sauce (to taste),  1 Tbls. drained capers and more dill.  I piped it onto cocktail rye bread and sliced cucumber rounds and garnished them with sprigs of fresh dill.   They were devoured instantly and guests were begging for the recipe.  One guest mother even called me the next day for the recipe because he told her how good it was. Thank you for sharing this delight!

I made a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I only had one cream cheese. I used 1 can of pink salmon rather than smoked, dried dill rather than fresh and I had to add much more than the suggested dashes of hot pepper and worcestershire. I added liquid smoke for the smokey flavor and brought it to a get-together. They couldn't stop eating it! Addictive!

OK guys, this stuff is ADDICTIVE!!  My god is it good!!  We had smoked some salmon and had some left overs so I searched and found this recipe.  I only used 1pkg. of cream cheese, 1/4c. sour cream, chives, 1T. lemon juice and just a dash of horseradish.  Actually, all done to taste.  I think some capers would be fantastic, also.  Anyway, the old man was out playing golf and when he got home he asked if I had made the spread, I kind of wrinkled my nose up and said yes. I said, "go ahead and try some if you want", so he pulls the crackers out and dips into it and looks at me like I'm nuts....he loved it!  I love doing that kind of stuff to him..sick, I know..but after 30 years....Anyway, we are planning on doing some more salmon just so we can have some of this spread. No lie guys, you will be impressed with this one, give it a try! Thanks!!

A wonderful recipe with a few changes. I substituted 2T horseradish for the hot sauce, increased green onions to 4T and increased the smoked salmon to 16 ounces. Thanks for sharing!

This has become a requested item at family gatherings.  Don't skimp on the sauces and herbs or the cream cheese will dominate the flavor.  Enjoy!

My husband smoked some salmon the other day in hopes that I'd find a good dip recipe. This is it! He can't stop eating it. My caveat to folks is to be sure to use *smoked* salmon (DIY and save a lot of money).  I added a little more salmon than the recipe called for, and I didn't have fresh dill, so I used dried dill (1/2 the amount called for). Finally, I mixed everything in a food processor to get a nice consistency.

We smoked some salmon, and had quite a bit left over, so I decided to give this a try.  I only had 8 oz of cream cheese on hand, so I halved the recipe, but after mixing & tasting, I decided to add the full amt of all the other ingredients.  I like a more salmon taste.  I think using real smoked salmon (not the canned stuff) is key for this recipe.  This was perfect w/ Town House crackers!  Will make again when we have company!  Perfect appetizer!

We got a pouch of smoked salmon for christmas..and were looking for something to use it with.  This was sooooo good. We put it on Ritz. I also added a garlic clove, pressed and 1 Tbsp. of sour cream to cut the cream cheesy taste.  I had no green onions so Ihad to use white but it was still awesome.

Delicioso! I followed other reviews and doubled the sauces. Also I used dried dill weed. I did it one day in advance, of course one day in the refrigerator makes the cheese hard, I took it out one hour before serving and it had a spreadable consistency. A new classic for my dinners or reunions.

Used less cream cheese and subsituted with sour cream (gave it less of a cheesey flavor). Also squeezed 1 fresh lemon. Excellent dip when you use less cheese!

Our family in Alaska brought some fresh smoked salmon when they came to visit. I had never tried it but decided to give this recipe a try. It was very good. I did however add a bit of black pepper, garlic powder, a tbsp of sour cream and a tsp of lemon juice. I gave it 4 *'s due to the fact that it was good without the additions but missing something. Thanks for sharing!

This is really good stuff! I am not a big seafood lover but I do like salmon and my husband makes great smoked salmon. I had some leftover and decided to try this. I had to use dried dill weed and I didn't have any green onion so I used fresh chives instead. Thanks for sharing! My picky 9 year olds even liked this!

AMAZING! This was so impressive I will make it again and again. I put it in a round mold and then garnished with green onions all around it. I also added 4 oz. of smoked salmon to make it less cheesy and 1 TBSP of lemon zest.

this is a great tasting spread.  i used a little less cream cheese and a bit more smoked salmon.  i also added some lemon juice and doubled the hot sauce for the extra kick.  i served it with those teeny bagels toasted with chopped tomatoes, red onions, and capers on the side.  i just made the batch this night but i've already consumed more than half.  thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Delicious! I omitted the Worchester sauce cause I didn't have any, but I put a few extra dashes of the green habenero pepper sauce made by Tabasco. Instead of the green onions I used minced white onions, and I also added garlic powder and black pepper. I didn't make it for a party, I made it to put on bagels.... DELICIOUS!

Although I don't like Salmon I thought I'd try this spread since it had such good reviews. Though it was a little pricey, everyone seemed to like it. A close friend even asked if there were any leftovers she could take.

Although I didnt really like this (too much bad hot sauce), everyone else LOVED it: "What was in that salmon dip? I could sit down and eat a bucket of that stuff".  I would definately make this again, but find a better hot sauce.  I hand-blended (processed) the salmon, and that worked great - it was still recognizable in the spread.  I served them with the cracked pepper Carr's Table Water crackers, and it was GREAT.  THANKS!!!

Fantastic recipe. I left the hot pepper sauce out and added some lemon juice to mine. Turned out great and will make for years to come. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

This is always a big hit.  I leave out the hot pepper sauce, but add the juice of 1 lemon.  Thin it with sour cream and/or milk to get the fluffy consistency I want.  And refrigerate at least a few hours (or better yet, overnight) to meld the flavors.  And I agree that using good quality smoked salmon is important (we like Tony's, which is quite available in Portland OR.  It's not expensive, but very good.)

Great on spoons, fingers and crackers. Smoked salmon from your own smoker it's hard to beat...

This was okay. I used some leftover salmon (that was NOT smoked salmon) for this recipe - which may have be the reason for my less than favorable review.  I too added some garlic powder and a TBLS of sour cream.  I never thought I'd say this b/c I love dill but the dill almost overpowered the other flavors. Not bad but I'm not sure if I'd make this one again.

I've made this twice now & both times a great hit. Second time halved cream cheese because it's just wife & me. Great blend of flavors. But I prefer a little more of the Worcestershire & hot sauce; so I kept original amount of those with just half of the cream cheese.

This was very good but I gave it 3 stars because to get a good flavor I had to add more seasoning.  I basically doubled everything but the salmon and cream cheese.  I also added a couple of splashes of lemon juice and a couple splashes of liquid smoke as well as about 1T of capers chopped.

Ok, I followed the recipe EXACTLY...but I tweaked it in one way. I put 4 oz of smoked salmon, chopped, in the spread. Now, the spread needs all 12, so what I did to make this a more elegant presentation. I got a cucumber slice, topped it with a little smoked salmon, then topped that with the spread. It was pretty and divine and accomplished the same taste. 

Repeat, it needs all 12 oz or it isn't too flavorful. The recipe is DIVINE!

used salmon that we caught and smoked.  i didnt have hot pepper sauce, but this recipe was still GREAT!  doubled the worcestershire sauce and green onions.  OH...also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese (next time may use 1 pkg of fat free and 1 pkg of 1/3 less fat cream cheese to make it a little healthier).  YUM!

I first reviewed this recipe in 2011. 2019 Update -  Use about 16oz of smoked salmon. Double the Worcestershire & hot sauce (use Tabasco) and 2 teaspoons of finely chopped (fresh) dill. I make this every year after our Christmas dinner whole salmon is picked over. I use the flake meat between the bones, under the gill plates, and bony pieces along the stomach, nothing goes to waste. It's turned into a huge family favorite for New Year's Eve and New Year's day.  If it gets any more popular, I'm going to have to either order a larger salmon or turn people down.

good guideline recipe, you need to go by taste.  I used 3 cans of salmon, adding 1/4tsp of liquid smoke per can. Then 2 pkgs of cream cheese.  I doubled or more the dill, added about 2-3Tbsp. of lemon juice (gives a great depth to the flavor), and used dried onion since I didn't have any green onion (about half of what it called for, maybe a bit more). I used the food processor to process all but one can of salmon, and added it at the end and just pulsated it to give a chunky texture.  I served with ritz, triscuits, and wheat thins, but I think the Ritz were the best.  Will make this again, so good I licked the food processor bowl out! ;D

I don't eat salmon (or fish in general) so relied heavily on the reviews of others, and they were right, this recipe is a keeper. The wedding guests I prepared this for loved this recipe, and I as asked for the recipe several times.  I reduced the cream cheese and the salmon by half, stuffed in baked wonton cones, with a bit of dill, and these went over like a storm.  So good!!!  Thank you!

Just made it for a party tomorrow and it tastes pretty darn good! Can't wait to try it after the flavors meld.

Totally agree with all the suggestions: Added lemon juice (a must!), added sour cream to make it creamier, I added more of all the seasonings and more of the hot sauce. 

Next time I'll add a few capers. I plan on serving them separately this time. 

Happy holidays!

My daughter & I made a trial dip last week, halved the recipe and added a couple tablespoons of chopped capers (used the zyliss).  We both loved it!!  Followed the recipe for our party last weekend and I'm handing out copies of the at work this week - EVERYBODY LOVED IT!!!!!

I do catering on the side and I had some smoked salmon left over and needed to find a recipe. This is a fabulous recipe. It was a big hit with everyone. For those who don't like onions I subtituted onion powder.

Love this dip! I love Salmon so much I only used one 8oz pack of cream cheese. If I were serving for a lot of people I would have used both packs to stretch it out. We love intense flavors so even though I only used one pack of cream cheese and 12oz of salmon, I doubled all other ingredients.

Rich, tasty, and easy to make.  I only had an 8 ounce package of salmon, so I used 11 ounces of cream cheese but kept the original measurements of the other ingredients.  I successfully used a pizza cutter for the salmon, as suggested by another reviewer.  Clever!  I've had another salmon spread with chopped cucumber.  It was delightfully bright and fresh with a little crunch, so I think I might add that next time.

This is a good start but I would add some lemon juice and capers, more worcestershire sauce, and use only 10-12 ounces of cream cheese rather than the 16 ounces in the recipe.

I had a box of salmon that was in a fresh pack and not refrigerated.  I had no idea how to use it so I used it to make this recipe.  I took it to a huge pot luck so the food was plentiful, but my dish was emptied first! That makes this a 5 star! I was afraid that is smelled too fishy but no one seemed to notice.

if I had a food processor I might have enjoyed this more, I had a hard time mixing everything together...in one bite I had too much cream cheese in another a big stringy piece of smoked salmon.

Made this for our Christmas party following a few suggestions from reviews. Reduced cream cheese by half and add 1/4 cup  of sour cream. I used 4 ounces of a very smokey salmon. The flavor really improved after about a day in the refridgerator. It was a hit.

1)I recommend using smoked Sockeye Salmon. I tried a less quality salmon and it was quite fishy and bland tasting. I switched back to Sockeye and it was 100% better. 2)Chives in lieu of onion.

This recipe was great, although I had to add *a lot* of garlic and extra dill to give it some flavor other than the cream cheese and salmon.  I brought it to a work function, and my boss just asked me for the recipe!!

Just pulled some fresh Salmon off the smoker and tried this recipe on the fly and was really disappointed, its missing something. Sour Cream??? Liked the Hot Sauce idea, but it's just really lacking in flavor until you add the sour cream.

I made this exactly as written (except I halved it and left out the dill because I didn't have any). I used lox style smoked salmon and I felt it was missing something. Dill may have been the answer, but I added a little lemon juice and it became fabulous!  I can't wait to use some freshly smoked salmon next time I make it.

good basic recipe.  I added finely chopped Italian parsley, sweet onion and fresh cream to loosen texture
(pretty stiff spread).  I omitted the dill (some family members do not like this herb).

This was a pretty easy recipe & I am glad to have found it. We went fishing in Alaska and have tons of salmon. This was delicious! We doubled the Tabasco amount & I did not have smoked salmon, just used regular cooked salmon and liquid smoke. Next time we might add some chopped jalepenos.

I used this recipe as a guide, I had some leftover salmon that needed to be used.  I did not add pepper sauce, added 1 teaspoon lemon juice, so good spread on a sandwich with lettuce, onion and tomatoes.  Will be making again soon.

Yum! I used dried dill, and had to estimate the amount of salmon because it was not from the store, but home smoked. Most certainly refrigerate for a few hours. I tasted it before and after. It was waaaay better after.

Excellent. The flavor was wonderful especially with the fresh ill. It is a keeper. By the way make it more economical, use the tub of salmon bits. No one will know the difference. Great spread for company. Thanks.

This was good, but I've had better.  It isn't the exact recipe I was looking for.  I think using whipped cream cheese would result in a better texture.

This is very good. I am lucky enough to have parents who spend there winters salmon fishing in our home town in Oregon. I always have a supply of canned smoked salmon and am always looking for different ways to use it. I served this with Gardettos roasted garlic rye chips. I added a little extra dill and worcestershire.

Easy and delicious!! My two favorite words.  I had some smoked Salmon we brought back from Alaska and wanted to use it in a spread like some we tasted while we were there.  This was very close.  Good on crackers or celery.  My husband loved it!!

I had a little trouble chopping the salmon but it was worth the effort.  I modified the recipe a little bit by using half the salmon called for and about 3-4 times as much hot sauce (Tabasco sauce) and served it with triscuits.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this spread as part of my appetizers for Thanksgiving.  It was wonderful!!  Everyone was eating so much of it I wondered why we bothered to cook a turkey!  I made it very quickly Thanksgiving morning(took about 20 minutes if your cream cheese is softened, to chop everything up and get it mixed well), put in a Tupperware bowl and took it with me to my mother's.  Very elegant, very easy, and very transportable if you are asked to bring something to a party or event.
P.S.  There are no leftovers.  Peggy B., Russellville, AR

I was in a hurry and needed a party dish. This spread is very yummy.  It's a little messy stirring cream cheese, but then I'm a klutz. : )

Yum!! This was my first attempt at salmon dip despite living in Alaska for 5 years. I had some smoked salmon that I wanted to use. I followed the recipe exactly but used a food processor that really made it creamy so I didn't have big chunks of onions or dill. I even used the fresh dill - not sure if it made much difference, but this was amazing! Very impressive for little work!

In my opinion the capers are a must plus a little of the caper juice, and the flavor gets better the longer you let it sit.

Outstanding.    We use the "brine for smoked salmon" by mike o.  Smoked with oak and little pecan.    Added a little lemon to the mix and at least doubled the Worcestershire and hot sauce.

I thought this was a nice change from the chips and salsa thing on a football Sunday.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I didn't have dill on hand but it was devoured - I served this with Ritz crackers.

Made this with hot smoked salmon and didn't really measure out anything... just followed the general proportions with whipped cream cheese, white onion, and dried dill as revisions. Ate it on Ritz (not what I would normally eat, but they are definitely delicious!) and really enjoyed it as a post-dinner snack. I was munchy.

Made this for a Christmas gathering and everyone really liked it.  It made a large amount, so I will only make half next time unless I have a lot of guests.  I served it on water crackers.  I couldn't find fresh smoked salmon so I had to use canned.  I imagine it would be even better with fresh, but it was still delicious and I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a very delicious recipe and easy to make. I whipped the cream cheese for2 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients (minus the salmon). After blending,  I folded in 12 oz of chopped smoked salmon. Serve with Triscuits or Wheat Thins.

This recipe is great but with the following improvements (I have made it like this about 10 times now and turns great every time): 1 pack 8oz cream cheese softened at room temp, 7 oz canned Alaskan salmon (red can brand), 3 dashes hot pepper sauce, 1 TB fresh dill, 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce, 2 green onions chopped finely, 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, hot chilli pepper flakes as desired for spiciness.  Mix all with a wooden spoon, transfer to a serving dish and place in fridge for 30 min to allow flavors to blend.  Delicious!!!

I made this just as written, only I quartered it for a small batch.  Also, I put some dill relish in the mix instead of dill weed cause thats all I had.  I put it on cracked pepper triscuits with lettuce and a slice of tomato.  It was a perfect lunch on a beautiful summer day out on my deck. Thanks!

This recipe was very bland tasting to me.  I added additional hot sauce, 1 tsp spike seasoning, and another 1 tsp of fresh dill.  Not quite what I was looking for.

This is super easy and elegant for a party. I did as others and added only 8ozs. of cream cheese and subbed sour cream for the other cream cheese. I added Lemon Thyme because my daughter doesn't like dill and it's still fantastic! I refridgerated it for several hours to let the flavors meld. Super good for parties! Impress your friends!

With a few minor changes, this was the hit of the party. First, I whipped the cream cheese with a little heavy cream. Then I added the salmon and the rest of the ingredients. This kept the salmon in larger pieces which makes a nicer presentation.  Also, I added a splash of lemon juice to give it a pleasant tang.  Served with crackers and capers, this rocked!

Made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. It turned out okay, but not great. I won't make it again. 

I did change the recipe a little as I almost always do, so maybe that was part of the problem. I used 1 pk cream cheese and 1 bag of smoked salmon (by Chicken of the Sea, I think, which can make a good dip as I've mixed it with other stuff before), dried dill, green onion and Worcestershire. 

I thought it seemed overly "fishy", and I did add a little more cream cheese after it was mixed to make it less smokey. I tried it again today (next day), and it was still too smokey and fishy. My mom thought it smelled terrible. 

I usually mix this salmon with some mayo, whatever cheese on hand (usually fresh parm - not the canned stuff!!) and dill, and it's pretty good on crackers. I think I'll stick with that.

very nice!  it was a little too cheesy and thick for me also so I added 1/2 cup L/F sour cream and 1 tbsp mayo...fluffed up nicely and still kept its flavor (we smoke our own coho so that's important to me).  I used organic cream cheese so that might account for the extra thickness.  Also subbed shallots for green onion.  Nice base recipe to experiment with or as a good standby.

I made this as an appetizer on Christmas.  It was a huge hit with everyone who tried it.  I used $18/pound Alaskan Smoked King Salmon, and I think that made all the difference.  The salmon should be the star of the show and I would be wary of just throwing in any cheap fish.  Overall this recipe is a definite winner and something I'm sure to make again.  In fact I'm being forced to make it again for New Years Eve.

Very good spread w/ the alterations of way more tobasco sauce, and I also used some sour cream  mixed in with the cream cheese to cut the consistancy.  I would make this again.

Love this one!  However, smoked salmon is pricy, so I used Starkist pink salmon and a few drops of liquid smoke......very yummy!

This was pretty good I made adjustments however, I used the boneless skinless salmon two small cans and 1 pack of cream chesse. I added garlic powder, and freshed cracked black pepper, with a dash of hot sauce. Plus I added toasted pecans and a tablespoon of lemon juice...it just adds a real kick without being to spicy! But great basic dish.

This was a very good recipe!  I increased the spicyness and substituted chives for green onion.  I also topped it off with a tiny dollop of caviar to dress it up a little.
Excellent!

This spread was a huge hit at all my parties...my guests can't get enough of it.  Not only were they putting it on the crackers that I had put out but, on the veggies and everything else they could get their hands on.  It is now a staple at any of our parties...

This was very flavorful and easy to make. Luckily I had all the ingredients so it was easy and quick to whip up. Next time I would add more salmon as it was a little creamier than I expected it to be and while there were hints of salmon flavor there wasn’t as much salmon as I would’ve liked. I will definitely be making again though. Thank you for the recipe!??

This was a good base to start with. it needed a lot more flavor to bring out that smoky taste. I knew it wasn't going to be enough green onions, dill, Worcestershire and hot sauce which I used Tabasco. I added more. about ; 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon Tabasco, 4 green onions chopped small, 1 tablespoon fresh baby dill chopped fine and added fresh lemon zest  from a medium size lemon. added sea salt to enhance the flavor. I kept the same amount of salmon. I will make it again but try smoke dry lox.

This recipe saved our too salty smoked salmon! Used 1/8 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup sour cream and did not have hot sauce so used cayenne pepper as suggested elsewhere in the comments.

Will I make this again?  You better believe it!  This recipe is amazing and so easy to prepare.  Plus, it is so pretty on a platter with crackers surrounding it.  I did not chop any capers, but I did add the juice from the bottle and a few whole capers.  This is what I call "luxury" eating -- even though it doesn't at all cost so much to make.  YUMMY!  Thank you so much for this recipe wahine!

I did as some suggested and doubled the Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. I also substituted onion powder and freeze-dried chives in place of green onions for two reasons. One, I was honestly too lazy to chop the green onions. Two, I didn't want to bite into green onions. I also whipped the salmon instead of leaving chunks. It was so smooth and fluffy. My whole family loved this recipe!

Made it to try out before I took to a luncheon and we couldn't stop eating it :)  We like strong flavors so I tried it as it was written and it was good but kept adding Worcestershire, cayenne, and eventually squeezed half of a lemon.  Also tried on plain saltines and Ritz.  Our favorite was the Ritz as it seemed to just melt in our mouths.

I used fresh smoked Amberjack (16 oz after I used the chopper to make it very fine) which may have been a bit drier than Salmon, so I added about 1/3 cup of half and half.  It tastes heavenly!

I had a 14-oz. prepared smoked salmon packet and I used all of it, so I added 2 more dashes each of Worcestershire and hot sauces to commensurate. I also blended in about 1 Tbsp of capers, chopped finely. Served the chilled and molded spread with a selection of water crackers at a New Year's Eve party, where compliments flowed about its well-blended flavors.

We make this all the time.  Everyone loves it and asks us to bring to their parties.  Use more salmon (16oz) or less cream cheese (12oz) and add a quarter cup minced dill pickle.

This recipe was decent as-is.  However, I added more hot sauce and worcestershire than called for, some garlic powder, and 5 pieces of crisp bacon (crumbled).  The bacon was an excellent enhancement.  I brought this to  poker party and 2 days later I still have people calling me for the recipe.

Delish! I used half of the cream cheese and salmon, but kept everything else the same. Put everything but the salmon in the food processor, blended it, then added the chopped salmon and just blended until it was all mixed together.

Really good dip. I had peppered smoked salmon so I only used 6 oz salmon and kept the remaining ingredient amounts the same. I used low fat cream cheese and fresh dill. Yummy with crackers and as a spread on toast

Delish. Followed exactly. Cut the recipe in half b/c it made a lot! After I chopped up the salmon, i threw on some rubber gloves and mixed all the ingredients by hand to make the spread. It really helped break down the salon so it wasn't too chunky.

Awesome, My husband loves Lox and bagels & cream cheese so this was the perfect recipe for the leftover smoked salmon we had for dinner; the Worcestershire sauce adds such a good kick! I added cracked peppercorns as well.

I had some leftover smoked salmon and wash't sure what to do with it until I came across this recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand and it turned out amazing!  We've been eating it with crackers or putting it on top of a bagel in the morning.  Excellent recipe, thank you!

1st salmon spread I've ever made, very simple, not so much taste I thought though.  I guess I had a saltier, thinner version before this and I was hoping it would taste like that.

Very good, if you like smoked salmon and cream cheese.  I added quite a bit more hot sauce and a little horseradish sauce to kick it up a notch.  Great for an appetizer type food.

Excellent.  Used a 10 oz. salmon filet that I hickory smoked myself.  Added a couple of extra drops of hot sauce and used dried dill because I didn't have fresh.  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely be adding a salmon filet to the smoker every time I fire it up.

Great base for a recipe, but I agree with other reviewers that said it was too cheesy. I used about half of the recommended amount of cream cheese, and used light cream cheese. Also increased the amount of seasonings by 2-3 times. Turned out to be excellent!

GREAT TASTE!!  Everyone at the party loved it.  I've been looking for this recipe for years.  Used canned salmon instead.  Making this again next week.

I don't care for salmon but my husband is a salmon fisherman so we always have a lot of it in the freezer. After he recently smoked some of it, I found this recipe and made it for him. He and his friends loved it. Thanks for sharing.
