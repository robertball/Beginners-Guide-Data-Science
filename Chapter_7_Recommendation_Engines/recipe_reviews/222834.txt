Adding 1/2 cup of brandy scant 3 tablespoons, but I also added the 3 tablespoons of Grand Marnier.
Fruit I added was peaches, kiwi, pears, cantaloupe  and cherries.  
Used 5 partial bottles of chardonnays I had gathering.  
Like the fact this recipe calls for only 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of a 1/2 cup like some others.

I would say the 1 liter of club soda is a bit too much for my taste.  I would recommend reducing it or just adding to taste at the time it's poured.

instead of diluting your drink with ice cubes....i froze the green grapes and used them.  this is an easy and awesome summer time drink and refreshing.

I liked this, but was looking for a little more of the orange liqueur flavor, so I did bump up the Gran Marnier a little.  I really prefer the more traditional white sangria with brandy (but that's just a personal taste preference).  Realized after taking the photo that I forgot to add the pear, but I added it later along with a few blueberries.  This made it even more of a refreshing summer drink with a fruit salad on the bottom :-)     Thanks Monica Joy for a nice summer drink for a BBQ.

This sangria is very light, refreshing and delicious.  I especially like that, unlike many other sangria recipes, it doesn''t include brandy, which in my opinion weights it down and takes away from the lovely fruitiness.  But that is our personal preference.  A very versatile and adaptable recipe.
