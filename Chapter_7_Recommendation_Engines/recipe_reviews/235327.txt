We loved this.  Meat was so flavorful and tender.  We made it exactly as written with the exception of adding some whole baby bella mushrooms and a little more garlic (extra garlic is a given in this kitchen).

I do a lot of smoking of briskets, ribs, tri-tips,turkeys and just about everything else.  Sometimes when I don't want to put the work in it, I use my slow cooker.  I used a 3.5 lb. choice eye of round, mostly sticking with this recipe.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular and of course more garlic powder.  I also added some of my brisket rub to this rub.  I also used mini Yukon Gold and Red potatoes.  Lastly, I made about 10 slits in the meat and shoved whole garlic cloves in them.  Cooked on low to an internal temperature of 150, about 6.5 hours.  Turned out better than expected!

I never thought of putting an eye round roast in the crock but after trying this recipe, I can't wait to do it again.  I used a 2.5lb roast and cooked it on low for only 3 hours. It was well done and juicy!  I left out the marsala wine and used red wine vinegar in place just because of what I had on hand.  I omitted the potatoes and made noodles instead.  Really a good recipe!

I made this tonight and the whole family really liked it.  I added mushrooms, though, and that was my husband's favorite part.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

The taste was pretty good but after only 3 hours on high it was already very well done so the meat was dry. I used a 3 pound roast and it would have been better with maybe 4 hours on low or 2 hours on high.

Made this last night for New Years Eve for company.  It turned out great - highly recommend this recipe for this cut of meat.  The meat was very tender. I did need to add more flour to thicken the gravy.

For those who said this was tough, it is a must to cook on low for eight to nine hours to achieve maximum tenderness.

I have done several crockpot/eye round recipes and was looking for something different.  The herbal rub was very nice and fragrant.  The roast stayed very moist.  I took several ladles of juice from the crockpot and whisked in the flour in a saucepan over high heat till thickened.  It didn't thicken without the heat.  I was very happy with this recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious.  The family loved this recipe.  Although, I cooked in the crock pot on high for 8 to 9 hours. It was 3 lbs.  For those of you that say it was tough, I've had the same experience in the past.   It wasn't done cooking.  Mine was still tough 6 hours in the crock pot on high.

It came out very tender and flavorful!!! I used a Swanson Flavor Boost Sweet Onion & Burgundy Wine packet to make the beef broth.  Also made slits and added the garlic to the meat. Didn't use potatoes. Cooked it on low 8 hours then refrigerated over night then another 3 hours low the next day. Only because it was programmable crock pot and we were late getting home. It wasn't dry at all.   First time I ever cooked this kind of meat in a crock pot. I will make again!!!!

This recipe was great I follow the recipe right to the end but I also added Worchester sauce, cayenne powder and yellow peppers.  It wasn't spicy at all.  The family loved it

Good flavor. It was a bit tuff. It was very tender after reheating in the slow cooker for dinner again the next day. It might have been that good on the first day if I HAD A FULL EIGHT HOURS ON SLOW.

This recipe is top notch.  Definitely one of the best roast recipes I've tried.  I added mushrooms and substituted Cabernet Sauvignon.  I cooked on high for 5 hours due to time constraints, and the meat was very tender.  I also added a little more flour to the gravy for thickness.

I've made this exactly as written, worked out great, low 8-9 hours is my preference and of course I've made it with variation.  I always brown the meat first quickly, I like a crisper outer shell.  I also use various rubs, the longer they sit the better.  I also let the meat come to room temp before placing it in the crock because I try to put the rub on the night before.  This recipe will work for most beef and pork roasts without fail.  My favorite adds, red wine instead of beef broth, horseradish mustard, giardeneria (hot, but mild is good too). and so  on...just throw in what you like, it will work...also, put this or even cheaper cuts in a crock with 16 oz beef broth, a jar of giardeneria, a jar of pepperoncini, generously season the meat prior with Italian seasonings, garlic, salt pepper, then, let it cook on low for 24 hours...it will fall apart, you have your italian beef sandwiches...even better with better cuts, but works with bottom round, top round, etc...

Used a small Eye of the round roast I found buried in our freezer on a cold snowy Sunday.  Followed directions exactly, only adding a little extra fresh diced garlic.  Very tasty - the roast didn't get as tender as I hoped, but I just sliced it thin and served with the grave generously covering both the meat and the veggies.  Would definitely make again. Hit the spot.

Absolutely LOVED it, but would use more Marsala Wine next time. I substituted mushroom brown gravy (it was all I had). I might also try a dash of balsamic. Outstanding!

I made it exactly as the recipe. The only exception was the roast I used was very thick so i added a little more broth. Five hours on high, removed from cooker, sliced about 1/4 inch thick. I returned the slices to  the cooker for an additional fifteen minutes to absorb more of the flavor. The meat was very tender and  tasty . Already looking forward to Round two!!

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results...Albert Einstein.

This is the 3rd or 4th time I have tried an eye of round roast in a slow cooker with or without vegetables and each time turned out horrible. I have to admit I used this recipe only to see how. long I need to keep it in the slow cooker. The vegetables are stew texture only with no flavour at all. I have to admit I did not use the spices suggested, I used keg steak spice and I have also been known to use Montreal steak spice which both essentially have same ingredients as the ones in this recipe. 

The roast tasted bland, vegetables unpalatable. It was so unappetizing I didn't even bother with a gravy.

The next day, we salvaged it by pan searing the leftover and added butter to the pan, more keg spice. Did make the gravy this time which helped combat the dryness. I also panfried the vegetables a bit to warm it up.

Roasts are just not meant to go in a slow cooker. This is too much liquid. If I could, I would rate this recipe zero stars. Never again will I try to slow cook a roast. I only considered this because I wanted it ready when we came home, better that I just roast it for 1-2 hrs  as I usually do.

We will definitely make this again!  It was easy enough to prepare and just forget for the day. At the end of the day, it was amazing!  We may have left it in a bit longer - but I think it just made the meat more tender. The marsala was really a nice touch.

This was really good. Made it two weeks ago & doing it again. I omitted the wine but everything else the same. I think the key to the flavor is the rub. My husband couldn't get enough. Great recipe.

Made as directed.. Meat was bland and basically tasteless, sauce was as well. Needs more flavoring to be worth making again. Was OK with hot sauce for me and ketchup for my daughter.

I also add a bit of Worcestershire sauce.  Towards the end, i.like to take the roast out and cut the roast into cubes, make sure the meat is seasoned and put it back in.

Followed recipe and meat came out like shoe leather. After cooking on low for about 6 hours I checked internal temperature of roast and it was 205 degrees. I'm assuming it overcooked. Although it was basting in the liquid, it came out  dry and inedible.

It was really good. Cooked it on high and it was finished cooking in about 4 1/2 hours. Had really good taste, added parmesan cheese at the end which was good.

I will say that I was not impressed with how my roast turned out. However, I think that's due to the fact that eye of round doesn't make the best roast since it's so lean and just gets tough. I was expecting a traditional pot roast type texture, so I was very disappointed. That's not a reflection on this recipe, though. 

I will say that I made the recipe as it is written, and found that I had way too much potato and not nearly enough carrot and celery. However, I favor vegetables, so that might just be personal opinion. The rub on the roast tasted wonderful.

I liked the ease and flavor of this recipe. I added mushrooms as some suggested since we love them. The roast sliced up nicely but I think it cooked a bit long, as the center seemed a bit lacking in juiciness and flavor. I will definitely make this again, and tweak the cook time. Thanks for sharing!

Very flavorful! The vegetables were my favorite. I added mushrooms and a few bay leaves, and I used a red wine blend instead of Marsala. I think that the meat was a little over cooked at 8 hours on low heat, but my roast was smaller so I probably should have adjusted the cooking time accordingly. Super easy and tasted delicious.

Wow, very tasty!  I used a "smoked" paprika, a lambrusco wine instead of marsala, and a bit of dried celery flakes instead of celery.  I did not have beef broth either, so I used water and let the  seasoning on the meat and the gravy mix did the rest.  I had mine on low from 9:30 am to 4:30pm and it was good to go, even though it was still a bit frozen when I started.  We ate some, then broke the meat into smaller chunks and left it on warm til 9pm.  The extra simmering really brought the seasoning into the potatoes, and i thought the juices thickened enough with the gravy mix, without any need to add flour.  I really enjoyed the flavor, and the meat fell apart pretty easily.   This recipe seems super versatile, and I will certainly use it again.

We had company over for this one, and everyone loved it! I even received compliments days later!  The only change I made was I added red wine because I didn't have marsala, and I seared the meat after rubbing it with the seasonings. This is definitely on my favorites list!

This is a delicious recipe. I made it for my husband who loves any cut of beef.  I’m more a filet mignon person when I do eat beef, but the flavor of this recipe is wonderful. Keeper recipe.

Dry. I followed the instructions exactly and the vegetables absorbed all the moisture and were delicious but the meat resting on top of the veges was Dry. It was almost like it cooked for 2+ hours too long.

It was delicious, moist,  tender,  and easy to cut. I did not use the wine, broth, or beef gravy. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a packet of Lipton Onion and Mushroom Soup,  and one cup of Au Jus Gravy. I had smashed potatoes instead of putting the potatoes in with the roast.  The juices strained made an awesome gravy. I cooked it on high for 2 hours and on low for 5 1/2 hours.  I would definitely make this again!

I seared the roast before putting it in the crock pot, & added a bay leaf. It cooked the full 8 hours & was so tender that I could shred it with a fork with zero effort. Delicious flavor, too! The juices made the perfect gravy.

Turned out great! I started with a 4.5 lb roast so I cooked it on high for 3 hrs and 6 hrs on low. Tender and delicious. The only changes I made were to add bay leaves and mushrooms to the gravy and I didn’t have Marsala so I used red wine. Very good and easy!

I didn't add the gravy mix. Used sherry instead of marsalla. Dished out solids and poured liquid into skillet to cook down into gravy by adding 1 tbsp. of cornstarch mixed with a 1/3 cup of water. Great dish!

I don't like leaving negative reviews but I feel I should warn people about this one. I made it exactly as written. I love marsala wine in chicken and veal dishes, but it didn't work here.

I focused on just the meat. Loved the seasonings. Only added onion upfront. At the end I warmed up a can of french style green beans and whole potatoes and added to the crockpot. De-lish! I will make it again, went over well!

Wanted to Sous Vide these pieces but found it would take 30 hours and we only had 10 hours until it was time to serve.  This set of instructions got us through to our new years eve meal and the results were great!  Everyone was impressed with the flavor and the texture of the meat.

The meat was fork tender!  I cooked it for 10 hours on low in the slow cooker and it was delicious.  I did use Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the spices, as another reviewer had suggested.  I sliced it thin and we had leftovers for sandwiches. Yummy!

The overall flavor was good, but it was too salty.  With the salt in the gravy mix and broth, adding more is probably not necessary.

This beef is amazing.  When it's done, I take the roast out of crockpot and let it rest for 20 minutes. I then cut the meat into thin slices and put it back in the crockpot with the aujus for another 1/2 hour.  So juicy and tender.

I have always had bad luck with roasts so j decided to try something in the slow cooker. I replaced celery with parsnips, added in a whole diced yellow onion, and used a homemade red wine that I received as a gift. The red winereally brought out the beef flavour. The meat just fell apart. I also used baking potatoes rather than boiling potatoes. I found they held up very well! 
Will definitely make again!!

I used beef broth instead of the wine and gravy mix. After food was done I made brown gravy from the broth.  It was very good. I will be making this again for sure. I also poked a few holes in the meat after it had cooked for a while to let the juices go in. nom nom.

I slow cook an eye roast for our family dinner after church every Sunday and was looking for some fresh inspiration, so I tried BramptonMommyof2's recipe.  DH & FIL raved about it and everyone else ate it stumpy-rumpy, so I will def. make this again.  My slow cooker is medium-sized so I prepared our potatoes separately.  The only other change I made was to replace the cup of broth with 3/4 of a crushed beef bouillon cube since my beef always creates a lot of extra water.  I cooked this on high for 5 hours.

This was very good. The only things I did differently were, I used russet potatoes because that's what I had and a package of dry onion soup mix instead of the gravy mix. I didn't have celery so just went with the carrots, potatoes and onion. I didn't put the vegetables on the bottom because I was worried they might get too brown. The roast was so tender and the gravy it made was outstanding. I will definitely make again.

The good:  The meat was delicious -- very tender and moist.  I modified the rub slightly by using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The meh: for some reason the liquid tasted bitter-ish, which made the potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions not nearly as yummy as I would have hoped.  Maybe it was the Marsala??? Next time I will substitute a burgundy wine and see what the results yield.  The meat was too tasty to not make again -- albeit with a slight twist.
