This was good, and a nice change of pace from the usual stir-fry. I made the stir-fry part exactly as written. (I served it over jasmine rice instead of cauliflower.) I do love riced cauliflower though, so next time I will make it that way. I usually make my own cauliflower "rice" by pulsing cauliflower florets in the blender for a few seconds.   Next time I will also add more orange liqueur because I couldn't taste it, but I imagine it would really brighten up the flavors.

I made this recipe as written and liked it, however, I would suggest some changes to the process. I baked the Tofu in the oven as directed, but found it to be an unnecessary step. You can easily heat the Tofu with the onions, garlic, and bell peppers. Also, the orange liqueur flavor did not come through on this dish and I was really looking forward to that! Overall this is a great dish and I would make it again with slight changes.

This is a deliciously different way to serve tofu. I had to make a couple of changes. I only had regular firm tofu that I pan fried. I also used orange blossom water instead of liqueur and red bell peppers instead of green. The flavor is unique and fantastic served over the cauliflower 'rice'. Thank you for the recipe.

First I do need to say that I am not crazy about tofu to begin with, but I do try out different recipes using it from time to time just to give it another try. This was decent. I agree with LilSnoo that it does need more orange flavor, as I did not taste it. Maybe try adding in some fresh orange juice or zest?  I also opted to serve this over rice. Some more sauce to spoon over the rice would've been nice too. This was a nice, light meal and I do think that someone that likes tofu (more than me) would really enjoy it. Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe has a nice light flavor. I might even add double the amount of liqueur next time. Cauliflower rice is my new favorite vegetable and hadn't thought of serving it with tofu...so I am glad to have a new dish to add to my weeknight dinners.

Surprise your kids with this flavorful recipe. This is a great recipe to use to introduce tofu to your family. They'll be surprised at how flavorful the tofu is and how similar the riced cauliflower tastes like rice.

The tofu was really great, and I would not have called myself a tofu fan before!
