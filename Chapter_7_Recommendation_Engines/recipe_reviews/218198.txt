After being reluctantly talked into trying avocado ice cream at the local Mexican restaurant, (I LOVE avocados, but in ICE CREAM?? My thought was EWWWW) and finding that I love it in ice cream as much as I do on nachos or in burritos, I was excited to see a recipe that seemed like it would simulate the taste I loved there.

This recipe, alas, is not it. The taste is similar, nice and smooth and decent avocado taste, but it is WAY too sweet for my taste. The version I had at the restaurant is very mildly sweet, which I much preferred. It seemed as if the taste of the avocados came through more at the restaurant too, which makes me think it was even a bit too sweet to allow the full flavor of the avocados to show through. It was good enough that I will try it again, with much less sweetener next time. I'm thinking probably 1/2-3/4 cup sweetener instead of the 1 cup this recipe suggests. But other than that, it was very good. And if you prefer very sweet ice cream, it may be perfect for you as is. But not for me.

To be fair I have never had avocado ice cream... if I loved avocado ice cream this would have gotten all 5 stars. I decided to try it out of curiosity and because I love avocado. It was similar to green tea ice cream in the way that it is not very heavy and borders on savory. VERY VERY interesting.

This is an OK ice cream but doesn't really have as much avacado flavor as I had expected. I think I used more avacado than what the recipie called for but it still needs more. It filled more than just a loaf pan for me. if I made this again I would add a lot more avacado and maybe some extra sugar too.
