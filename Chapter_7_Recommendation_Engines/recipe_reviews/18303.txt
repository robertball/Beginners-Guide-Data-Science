My husband's mother has served a similar cornbread pudding with Thanksgiving dinner for at least 30 years, and I've been the one who made it for the last 12 or so.  Our version also includes 1/2 c. of melted butter or margarine and 2 well-beaten eggs.  If anybody tried it Brandy's way and it came out too dry, try it our way.  I started making it when I joined the family 15 years ago.   It's so easy that kids can make it and have it come out great every time.  It's become one of my favorite comfort foods.  Moist and a little sweet and really yummy.

I made it with 2 eggs and it was pretty good. I liked the texture. The next time I will make it with the butter also to add a bit more flavor. BTW it only took 45 minutes to bake using the eggs. Maybe because I had drained the corn(the recipe didn't specify).

This is a good one-be sure to add two eggs to make this even better.  It is a favorite with our holiday meals.

A stick of butter makes this really special!  And a can of chilis + 1/2-1 tsp cayenne for extra spice. Serve with chicken enchilada soup for a yummy, comforting Mexican night.  Hot chocolate or ice cream w cinnamon sugar to finish the meal makes it perfect.  OLE'!

Very good - I used two cans of creamed corn (didn't have whole kernel on hand).  Worked out fine.

this was very good but the only reason i gave it four stars is because i am not certain what the consistency is supposed to be.  it certainly isn't cake like.  it is a bit wet as reviewer lissa mentioned. i figured it was cornbread "pudding" so it should be pudding like.  can someone please let me know because i don't want to be eating anything undercooked.  thanks.

I have been making this dish for years now, and we are never disapointed. I also add the eggs and butter but I use a can of mexican style corn, with the red and green peppers. Adds a little more flavor to it. I at times pre-cook bacon, crummble it up and add it to the mixture. There are NEVER leftovers!

AWESOME!!!  I doubled this, added 4 eggs(because I doubled) and one stick of butter melted in casserole then mixed in.  Cooked in 90 minutes exactly which makes me wonder if 90 minutes is a bit long for the original, undoubled recipe??? I might add just a tablespoon of sugar to the doubled recipe next time.

Fabulous recipe.  I keep the ingredients on hand just in case we have unexpected company - my husband grills & I whip this up.  I add a 1/4 cup of brown sugar & it comes out great - everyone loves this stuff!!!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

I replaced sour cream with 1 stick butter, melted it first in casserole dish, then stirred in corn, jiffy cornbread, and 2 eggs.  Microwaved 15 minutes, then topped with 1/4 cup corn flakes mixed with 1/4 c butter.  Baked at 350 another 30 minutes.  Good!

Exceptional. I added two eggs as suggested, omitted the pepper, and sprinkled the batter with granulated sugar before baking. We like it sweet and the sugar topping creates that gooey top...Mmmmm!

I followed BAKRAGAL's suggestion of adding 2 well-beaten eggs and a stick of melted butter and it turned out FABULOUS. Four of us ate the entire 9x13 dish of cornbread pudding. I highly recommend you make these changes too... You won't regret it!

I made this as written, except added two eggs as most of the reviews suggested.  It looked and smelled amazing!  I scooped it out of the casserole dish with a spoon and put it on my plate, excited to take a bite...as moist and cakey as it looked, it was surprisingly like a soggy mush.  We did not care for the texture of this one, sorry.  As good as the sour cream sounded, I'll stick with the Basic Corn Muffin recipe from Doug.

I had Marie Callender's honey butter corn bread mix on hand  so that was the first substitution. The second was  using goat yogurt for sour cream. Needless to say it was the hit of the potluck Christmas party. Many asked for the receipt.

Followed the recipe then added the recommended ingredients.  I added two eggs and 1 stick of butter.  Still, my wife thought the recipe was a bit bland.  Then I realized I left out the salt and pepper.  Definately will add that next time.  Also, next time I'll use only a 1/2 stick of butter and add a kick...maybe cayenne pepper or green chilies.

I add 1/4 cup melted butter, and cook it only for 40 minutes, then sprinkle about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the casserole, return it to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.  Much tastier, since it adds some saltiness from the cheese to contrast with corn's sweetness. Also the shorter baking time does not dry out the casserole.

I added 2 eggs and a stick of butter as others suggested. This was one of the most popular items on the table, I will definitely make it again.

ETA:  This year I forgot to get sour cream, so I used 3 oz. of cream cheese (softened and then stirred into the melted butter) plus a little half and half.  Turned out great.

Here's what I did. Using the Johnny cake recipe as a guide, I beat the corn muffin mix 1 egg 1 can of creamed corn, 1/2 stick of softened butter & 1/4 of milk together and poured into a buttered 8x8 and baked at 400° for 25 min. (I first followed this recipe and it didn't come out well at all. The 9x13 made it way to thin. It tasted ok kinda but it just wasn't right. My way came out like a very moist buttery corn bread cake)

Omgsh I wanted to take a picture but it's all gone lol. Maybe next time I'll take a picture. This recipe is way better than Golden Corral. I tried the advice of 1 stick of melted butter and 2 eggs beaten. I also added 1/3 cup of carnation milk (that's the instructions on the jiffy box) baked at 350 for 1hr or until the middle was cooked. Then I drizzled some honey on the top. Shut the front door!!! Delish my new comfort food. If your trying to loose weight stay away. Lol cause your going to eat this up. I'm never making regular cornbread again.

It was edible, but lacked ingredients. I've had something similar that was much more creamy and flavorful.

this was excellent, paired it with the Cruchy Apple-Pecan Slaw by M.K. Bishop and they were perfect for the cook-out we went to.

This was delicious, but I'm glad I remembered that my recipe added a stick of melted butter. It is better reheated the next day.

I just moved and can't find any recipes. My children thought this recipe was our very own family recipe I have been making for 20+ years.  Thank you for saving the day!!!!

My sister made this once and it was amazing.  I did something wrong.  I had a hard time with the measurements as our cans weren't the same.  But I know it's excellent cuz my sister did it right and I almost died and went to heaven.

OK- but VERY bland.  It needs something.
