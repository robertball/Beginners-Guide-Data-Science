This has to be the greatest lamb marinade ever.  Did not have the asian chilli and used Thai sweet chilli sauce instead and it worked out.  Definitely a keeper.

This was the best Lamb Marinade ever, made it for mother's day and have not stopped thinking about it since!! I made Lamb Kabobs with it for 11 people and made 40 Kabobs with lamb and 40 each of chicken and shrimp- the lamb was the only ones that were completly devoured. Even the guests that did not like lamb LOOVVEED it! I could not find any Asian Chile paste, but what I did find was Asian Curry paste- so I used that instead and just omitted the Curry. Gonna make this again, very very soon!

My husband and I loved this.  Great complement to lamb.  One son liked it, one didn't.  It would make a great dish to grill for company with some jasmine rice and Indian rotis, and a nice salad.

This is unreal!  Highly recommend this for grilled lamb chops.  Server with some middle-eastern rice and you're in for a treat.

Excellent.  Not too much liquid, great flavour, perfect for lamb cutlets on the BBQ.

Great marinade. I was worried that we had company that didn't like heat and this recipe has indian spices. On top of that we had to leave the boneless leg of lamb in the marinade for about 48 hrs. But we seared the roast on the grill first and then put it on the rotisserie and it was perfect. Even those who don't like the spicy stuff thought the lamb was fantastic. Will definitely use this marinade again.

Absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have chili paste and it was still great.  Great for kabobs.

this was very good, I had a large dinner party and used it as shish-kabobs I received several compliments. Most people couldn't tell I was using lamb, so an excellent recipe for those lamb skeptics :)

This was a great marinade! I forgot the honey but donâ€™t think it was a flavor breaker by any means.. You did a 1/4 t. of lemon pepper, a couple dashes of Chinese 5spice, a couple dashes of cumin, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

Perfect marinade, used it with a whole leg of lamb. Marinated for 24 hours and then grilled on the rotisserie.

OMG.... that pretty much sums up this dish. I was given over 20 lbs of lamb (chops, ground, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, etc.), and I had never cooked it before. I was looking for something simple to put on the grill and came across this recipe. I mixed all the ingredients together, and then placed it along with the chops in a large ziplock bag. I left it in the fridge for 4 hours and then threw it on the grill. I will admit I forgot the lemon zest, but this had to be one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted in my life. I had to pull the bones away from my husband, because he was gnawing on them. YUM.
