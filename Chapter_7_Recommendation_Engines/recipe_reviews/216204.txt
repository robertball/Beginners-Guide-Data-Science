So I'm not a big fan of store bought cookie mixes so I made a few adjustments to this recipe.  I basically just followed a recipe for regular chocolate chip cookies and added the mint extract, food coloring, and creme de menthe chips.  DELICIOUS and BEAUTIFUL!

My grocery store didn't have creme de menthe chips so I swapped in a package of Andes mints, chopped. I don't know if that effected the yield, but I ended up with exactly 4 dozen. So good! I will be sharing these at my holiday cookie exchange!

I did not have sugar cookie mix available to I made some substitutions. Here's what I did: 1 1/4 c. butter, 3/4 c. sugar, 2 1/2 c. flour, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract, 6 drops green food coloring. They turned out like green, mint chocolate cookies--yum! Just what I needed to get in a Christmas mood.

Wow - very good cookies!  I always make recipes "as is" the first time around and tweak later on, but this one doesn't need much, if any, changes.  I would strongly suggest using only unsalted butter - you get creamier results than using margarine.  And don't skimp on the chocolate by using basic brands - next time the only change I will make will be to use high-end dark chocolate chunks as opposed to semi-sweet... they'll be a tad less sweet but still scrumptious!

I used Betty Crocker's Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookie mix, which already includes the chocolate chips, so I skipped the semisweet chunks & creme de menthe chips.  4 drops of green food coloring made the dough VERY green, so I stopped there.  However, the color baked out, so the final product was BARELY green & I wish I had done all 6 drops.  The mintiness is PERFECT & I'd like to try them with the creme de menthe chips (just have to find them)!  These cookies were gone in a day & definitely deserve 5-out-of-5 stars!

Easy to make and very yummy if you're a mint and chocolate fan.  When I tasted just the cookie dough I thought it might need a bit more mint extract but after they were baked they were perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again.

If you are BIG on mint, then these are for you. They were pretty good.  The first batch I followed exactly, and they were a bit much, so when I made them again I cut back on the menthe baking chips.  They were perfect for me then.

I made this as instructed except I used bittersweet chocolate instead of semi sweet. They were FABULOUS!! I didn't cut back on the extract or the mint chips. If you like andes mints or peppermint patties you will really love these!

These cookies are very minty for sure! I did not try these, but my family really seemed to enjoy them. I used a 10 ounce bag of Nestle dark chocolate & mint chips, which was 2 cups. This was my first time ever baking with a cookie mix, and I have to say I would rather bake from scratch. I don't want to be unfair with the rating because of that though. I baked these for 8 minutes and the edges started to get really dark. I tried to bake a few on parchment to see if it made a difference, and it did, but they spread more. Also, add a few more drops of green food coloring, because the color wasn't very prominent. I used liquid so if you use gel, you will need less. I love the idea though, and would definitely make a drop sugar cookie recipe and add the extract, mint chips, and food coloring. If you love mint chocolate chip, then go ahead and try these. I think I would prefer using a from scratch recipe though as the base. These would be great for St. Patrick's Day. Thanks for the idea :)

I made these for my mint/chocolate chip ice cream lovers in my house and the battle is on!! My husband hid them at the top of the pantry where my 11 yr old can't reach, so now I joined in and moved them so only she knows where they are! They absolutely LOVE them! I couldn't find mint chips, so I used Aero Mint "Bubbles". I chopped them up to be chunks and also I used mini chocolate chips. They didn't turn out very green, even using 8-10 drops of food coloring. Doesn't really matter, everyone loves them!

These cookies are really good, but you have to be a big mint fan. I couldn't find the mint baking chips so I crushed up some Andes Candy (it takes almost an entire box of the candies for 1 cup). I used 8 drops of green food coloring and my cookies had a nice light green color.

Very good!  This dough is stiff, so make sure your butter is very soft.  That way, you don't have to pulverize your chips just to fold them in.

I had to give this 5 stars for the idea. I bake everything from scratch. I love Nestle Toll House chocolat chip cookie reciepe the best. If you like your cookies soft and fluffy, use real butter, baking powder not soda, and add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. They are the best. Then I added green food coloring, and left out the vanilla and added 2 tsp of mint extract in its place. They were fabulous. If you like your cookis more crunchy then use shortening and the baking soda, no extra flour.

edible but not great.  I personally love mint chocolate chip but these would be better if you use the recipe minus the mint extract and use mint chips instead.  The cookie tastes weird with the extract.  Bummed....

If you like hard cookies, as I do, bake them at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.  Next time I will omit the green coloring, as my Poker Group thought they tasted great but looked disgusting.  I did use 1tsp. mint extract as I love mint and they were perfect.

These cookies are sooooo effin awesome! For X-mas we made dough for 4 dozen cookies, rolled them into 4 equal cylindrical loaves, wrapped them tightly with seran wrap, printed the recipe and gave them out for "after x-mas cookies." No one wants more treats as gifts at X-mas so we gave them frozen and explained to the recipients that they were meant to be used for a future date. Just got text from my sis that they made them during a snow day in February and then they made a second batch themselves!

Tried these because I was looking for a holiday cookie that was simple but tasty to all - job done!!  They have just a hint of mint and they made great last minute gifts served on little holiday cookie plates.  Would probably also make on St Patty's Day, if I could find the creme de menthe chips.

I was surprised how much we liked these.  I NEVER use a cookie mix, and was not sure if a sugar cookie was the right base for a chocolate mint cookie, but these were quite good, and made a nice contribution to my Christmas baking.

Very minty, so if you're not a mint fan than I'd steer clear. I, however, LOVE the combo of chocolate and mint, and found these chewy cookies to be the perfect cure for my sweet tooth! They'd be great for St. Patty's Day too.

Yum! I made these exactly as the recipe says except I added a few more drops of food coloring for extra green cookies. They tasted great! The only problem I faced was slight sticking to the cookie sheet. Some of them looked funny but they tasted the same. My Husband took some to work with him and one of his employees requested the recipe!

The recipe is great as it is, no need for alteration. These taste exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream... but are better because they're cookies! Use Andes creme de menthe baking chips for the best result.

They're a hit where ever I take them and simply impossible to keep in the house for longer than a day. A must-bake if you love mint.

These cookies are good but make sure you don't mix them in with other cookies. My sugar cookies tasted like mint after leaving them in the same tin. I couldn't find the baking chips so i went with Andes mints and they worked out great!!! I will make again.

Easy and simple recipe! I found the ingredients, directions and baking time spot on! I even had the exact servings of 3 dozen cookies (36 cookies). I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels instead of chocolate chunks because it’s all that I had on hand. I found Andes’ crème de menthe 10 ounce baking chips at Longs Drug Store on sale for $3.89. The batter was easy to mix up and scoop onto an ungreased baking sheet at 2 inches apart. The cookies were done in 8 minutes. They were perfectly rounded and a nice light green color with slightly brown edges. The essence of mint filled up my kitchen. They are tasty, minty, chocolate-y and sweet cookies. As other reviewers stated they remind me of mint chocolate chip ice cream and also hubs said they reminded him of the Andes mints, an after dinner mint wrapped in green foil, which can be found at restaurants! I was pleasantly surprised at how well these cookies turned out for a store bought cookie mix. If you like mint you would definitely like these cookies. I think these would be a nice festive Holiday treat for Christmas or St. Patrick’s Day.

I am not a fan of  mint chocolate chip, but my boyfriend is, so I made these cookies. I think they are delcious! Yum! They were gone in a day and I had to make more. They are our new favorite cookies. I used andes mints and just crushed them. And also in my opinion you have to use chocolate chunks not chips! Perfect mint taste, not overpowering!

An easy twist on the classic chocolate chip cookie. Used crushed up Andes Mints and the outcome was delicious. My roommate, friends and boyfriend were all asking for seconds even though none of them have a "sweet tooth". Great, festive holiday cookie, too!

Absolutely delicious - i have a similar high maintenance recipe where you make everything from scratch that I received from my MIL. I always get requests for the recipe, has always been my husbands favorite, etc. I made this recipe replacing the mint extract with vanilla (1tsp) and added my "normal" christmas time chocolate mint chips (1 full bag) and rolled in granulated sugar before bakin as my other recipe calls for - and my husband couldn't tell the difference!! I let him eat 10 before i finally told him :) I always wait until Christmas time and buy about 10 bags of the mint chips they sell - not the ones that are fake colored green by the german brand- you want the ones sold by Nestle that are either a bag of half choc and half mint or the ones that all look chocolate but have the mint taste - seems like they are experimenting with which ones to sell - but stock up at Christmas. These are GREAT and I love the shortcut!!!

I made these cookies last night after seeing the recipe on the home page. I'm not usually one to bake from a box, but I just moved and I left most of my baking ingredients with my former rommates. I happened to be at Big Lots and found a box of Paula Dean sugar cookie mix so I used that, and I used chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks. And as someone else said, Andes creme de menthe chips are sold at Wal Mart and they're just Andes mints broken up so you don't have to do it by hand. I added 6 drops of green food coloring and they ended up only slightly green, not like the picture shows, but I used a different cookie mix. They ended up really crumbly and not soft so I was disappointed.

I thought these were excellent.  Very minty, but I love chocolate and mint together.  I followed recipe exactly except I cooked for 12 minutes because they were not done enough at 10.

I did only use about 3/4 cup of the andes baking chips as that was all I had and I thought that was plenty. I also subbed bittersweet chips for semisweet and did not add food coloring. Even though I normally do not buy cookie mixes, this was a fast and delicious recipe that I will definitely make again!

These cookies were excellent!  This was a lot of chips for the amount of dough so to save a few creme de menthe chips I might reduce it to 3/4 cup of chocolate.  I also did not use the food coloring since I didn't have any and it turned out great!

These cookies were AMAZING!! Mint chocolate chip is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor so to put it in a cookie just blew me away! After tasting these cookies while still warm I was worried about the mint extract, thinking it was too minty but after they completely cooled the flavor was fine, not too minty or anything. Everyone in my house has fallen in love with these. I will absolutely make these again, probably around thanksgiving and christmas.

I love these cookies!  They are so refreshing with the mint.  The next time I make them, I am going to use 1 cup of M&Ms instead of chocolate chips because I just love the crunch they give.  Also, if I use chocolate chips, I use milk chocolate rather than semi-sweet.

I made these for a Christmas Eve gathering this year and loved them .  So easy and so soft and delicious!  My store did not carry the creme de menthe chips so I just used the chocolate chunks and that worked just as well.

Pretty good, but it was really difficult to tell when they were done! My first batch was slightly overbaked, despite my underestimating the time, but the second one was perfect. Also, I ommitted the food coloring and used chopped Andes mints.

These cookies are pretty tasty as is. But, in subsequent batches, I've added a tad more of the food coloring and the mint extract. Also, I always line my cookie sheets with foil when I make these, because the edges brown way too much when I don't.

I love this recipe! Quick and easy! I know I can make them w/o the sugar cookie mix, just make my own. But, the mix makes it that much easier. I found a bag of mini hershey bars (mint choco, mint dark choco, and mint white choco) I chopped those up and used them for my chips. So good!

Excellent flavor.  These were a huge hit at work. I've made them at least 3 times already.  Great "green food" for St. Patricks day gathering at the office.  When I made them for the first time, it was around Christmas time and I was able to find the baking chips, recently I also had to substitue a box of Andes mints that I chopped up.
This cookie is like eating a bowl of Chocolate Mint Chip Ice Cream - very yummy!

Here's an easier & less expensive twist.  Begin with the Betty Crocker Chocolate Chip cookie mix (extra chips already in the mix).  Instead of buying 1 bag of creme de menthe chips AND 1 bag of chunks, buy 1 bag of Nestle's Dark Chocolate & Mint Morsels and use approximately 1/2 of the chips.  It's healthier if you don't use the food color & less expensive - unless you already have it. I admit the cookies in green are more festive looking.  I added a little more mint extract.  The cookies were amazingly delicious (just not green)!

I think these tasted alright and was easy, good for a Christmas program cookie at my son's school.  Next time I would add more food coloring.  The unbaked dough looked OK, but after they baked they were kind of a pale and sickly looking green.

I absolutely loved these cookies! I didn't want to go out and buy sugar cookie mix so I used just a plain chocolate chip cookie recipe, but used the recommended amount of mint chips and chocolate chips. Also use A LOT MORE FOOD COLORING! I used 9 and they looked like moldy cookies. So just a heads up!

These cookies were soft and had a nice texture.  I thought they were a bit on the bland side though.  They did have a minty flavor, but I thought something was missing, though I can't quite figure out what.  I might try making them again and change a few things to improve taste.

Very good cookie - I used a "Bittersweet" choc. chip instead of semi-sweet just because we prefer, but that chip was a bit bigger than the regular chips so it created big chocolatey blobs throughout the cookies - just didn't look as pretty. Next time I will use a chip more uniform in size to the creme de menthe baking chip.

Yum!  My 5yo and I were commenting that the dough looked like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  We also couldn't fine mint chips at our grocery store, but used chopped up Andes candies.  I also used dark chocolate chips, as no chunks were available.  I baked for 11 minutes, and they were perfect, not brown, not crispy, not soggy.  Thanks for sharing!  These have made it into my (considerable) list of Christmas baking recipes.

Excellent cookie!  Green food coloring is not a must - save yourself $2.50.  Scooped 2 teaspoon drops onto baking pan, and it made a slew of mint 'crisps'.  Excellent combo of mint and chocolate!

I had made these today and they came out great! But when I went to the store today, they were out of the sugar cookie mix. So I made chocolate chip cookies and added the mint, the chocolate chunks and the mint chips. I wanted that green color too so I added the food coloring. After cooking them, they weren't so green anymore,lol. So don't bother with the food coloring if its not sugar cookie mix. I even added about 15 drops. In the bowl it looked awesome but not after I cooked them. I also followed the chocolate cookie cooking time and temp, not this recipes. I had to cook them for 10-12 mins at 350. I added this notation just in case. Enjoy!

These are pretty good! Like another reviewer, I just used a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe as the base, instead of the cake mix. I also added a little more peppermint extract than listed, as well as a couple more drops of food coloring. I must say, I do prefer standard chocolate chip cookies more, but these are fun for the holidays.

If I could give these 10 stars I would!  These are awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and used the Andes Mint Chips.  The green food coloring is not disgusting as it fits with the holiday season (or for St. Pat's day!).  You could leave them plain or even  red for mint flavor too!  You could do whatever color you wanted.  Whatever you choose, these are wonderful!

This was the first time I've ever used a cookie mix.  The dough was really stiff, but the cookies baked up great.  I had to use more than 6 drops of food coloring to get the mint green color.  Don't be afraid to use more if you have to.  It doesn't hurt the dough and you can't taste it.  Everyone who tried these said the recipe is definitely a keeper!

My green cookies were easy to make and a hit at the cookie exchange :)  I double the recipe, except for the food coloring (I used 1.5 times the amount) and it was still very green :)

I followed the recipe exactly except for i did not have mint chips so i used white chocolate and drizzled milk chocolate over the top. turned out So cute for my christmas plates! i did a little experement by adding crushed candycanes to one batch and they were almost disasterous. they cook PERFECTLY with the oven at 350 and cooking them for 10 minutes exactly, they turned out fantastic! so cute thanks for the fun recipe!

Mint ANYTHING gets my vote, and these tasty cookies were no exception! Craving these since saving them to my recipe box a long time ago, I finally made them today. I thought I had an extra bag of the mint chips in the freezer, but I didn't. *Sigh* However, I upped the peppermint extract to nearly a tsp to compensate. Also, only 6 measly drops of food coloring? I think not! I added drops to my liking. I decreased the amount of the chocolate chunks to 3/4 c (don't like a lot of "stuff" in my cookies). Next time, I would omit the chunks altogether and use all mint chips instead. Perfectly chewy on the inside, and slightly crispy on the outside is exactly the texture I love in cookies, and I didn't mind using the mix at all. Quick, easy and yummy always wins in my book! Delish!

I couldn't find mint extract in the store so instead of 1 cup andes mints and 1 cup chocolate chips,  I just used 2 cups of the andes creme de menthe chocolate.  Still delicious, especially right out of the oven!

TO ALL MINT/CHOCOLATE LOVERS: I made these cookies twice and everyone loved them both times. I am not the best baker but these were SUPER easy. I read all the reviews and made a couple changes to my final recipe. I used 8 drops of food coloring which made them the perfect color green. I also cut up and used Andes Candies rather then creme de methe chips. Anyone who loves mint and chocolate will love these cookies - they were d-lish and I will definitely be making them in the near future!

Followed recipe as best as I could due to what my grocery store had to offer. They didn't have the creme de le menthe baking chips so I used the andres mints and I used 10 drops instead of six. These are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!

these were ok...flavor is all right, but too sweet, even for me, and the texture is softer than i like:  i might have been able to crisp them up a bit if i baked them longer...probably won't make them again since there are cookies i like better

What a surprise!  Like one of the previous reviews, I'm not a fan of box cookie mixes either.  But these are so good, and you'd never know they came from a pre mix. I can't taste the difference.  I also tasted the batter with the only the mint extract, and I agree it didn't taste like mint at all.  I'm thinking you may not need the extract because the Andes mints is what really is giving it the flavor.

I usually bake the harder version of the chocolate mint cookies but wanted to see if this turned out similar.  Although the other one is better, this is an easy enough recipe for anyone who is a beginner to make. I used ghirardelli dark chocolate chunks because I didn't want them to come out super sweet with all of the baking chips/chocolate added. Also, I added one extra drop of the food coloring. The color turned out nice. Baked for 9 minutes and they came out perfectly chewy.

very good cookie! i made them purple for my 2yo lil girl thats obsessed with purple and kept asking for a purple cookie. even tho a color change they still turned out really good. my boyfriend took them to work and shared. they were quite impressed with how good they were! other then food coloring the only thing i changed were the mint chips. i coudlnt find the kind they asked for so i just used nestle tollhouse mint chocolate chip mix. i just used 2 cups of that instead. ill be making these again and again and changing the color as requested!

Well, I am on the fence. I like the concept behind these cookies but they didn't turn out exactly as I expected. I made them exactly as the recipe was written but I only had gel coloring and I added a little too much so they are bright green! Anyway, the dough was quite sticky and I had a hard time getting them baked just right. In the future I think I will follow a chocolate chip recipe and add the minty stuff instead of vanilla and regular chips. They taste good but don't look quite as expected! Will try again!

These are delicious!  I used a small cookie scoop to make sure they were all the same size and it made a total of 2.5 dozen, not 3.  I chilled the dough for about an hour before forming it into balls and baking because it's easier to handle.  So yummy!

I should have known better than to put two cups of chocolate chips (mint and semisweet) into a box of cookie mix.  It was way too many chocolate chips - next time I will use half cup of each and it will still be plenty.  I had more chocolate chips than dough and couldn't possibly include all the chips in while forming the cookie balls.  Great recipe otherwise.

I am a die hard mint chocolate fan.  The mint flavor was an after taste.  You didn't get it right away.  I would suggest doubling the mint pieces and cutting the choc chunks if you want a true  minty tast.

Made these yesterday and loved them! No mint chocolate chips/chunks to be found where I live, so I bought a mint chocolate bar and chopped it. I used cake decorating food colouring (I had it on hand rather than the liquid drops), which worked really well. Too easy in my KitchenAid stand mixer! My husband and 2 teenagers love these and they are definitely added to my list of Christmas baking recipes! Thanks for posting!

Very good, especially when warm from the oven! Made as directed, except I used mint and chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks and creme de menthe chips. Very easy to make!

I couldn't find mint extract, so I used peppermint extract and they came out great! I also used Andes mints - couldn't find creeme de menthe chips either. They were delicious! My husband and son went crazy over them. I am now baking them for holiday gifts! Thanks!

These cookies are so good!  When we saw the recipe in a parenting mag, we just had to have them.  I did not change a thing.  For the chips, I used a bag of half dark chocolate and half mint, which Toll House makes.  Perfect.

My daughter loves mint chocolate chip ice cream so I decide to make these as a Christmas treat for her.  She loved them and took them to school to share with her friends.  Our house smelled like an ice cream shop when they were baking.

These are the Best Cookies Ever...if you like mint chocolate chip ice cream you will love these cookies.  They are beautiful paired with other holiday treats...I increased the food coloring to 12 drops and used 1/2 tsp of Peppermint flavoring.  Enjoy!

I had been looking for a different kind of chocolate chip cookie recipe when I came across this one. I was excited because of the positive reviews. I followed the recipe and the cookies came out perfect. Not too minty, but just right!!! Love these cookies!

Used a sugar cookie recipe from this website, and only used the creme de menthe chocolate just to see how it would taste w/ that. I didn't like it at all. The sugar cookie was good, but w/ the mint, it was just too much. I'm sure if I had added the mint extract as well, it would've been completely inedible.

This is a simple and delicious recipe!  It is VERY minty, and the perfect amount of chocolate.  I would almost say that it is too much mint, but a very good recipe I will keep in mind in the future.

Ok - made these and they are fabulous! Andes mint chips are indeed hard to find. Wal-mart and/or Meijer if you have one in your area are about the only places you'll find them...although i don't know why. At Wal-mart they are not typically seasonal-at least not in my area. Tonight i am trying this exact recipe with the Andes peppermint baking chips-which i believe are new this year, and using red food coloring, peppermint extract and white chocolate chips instead. Wouldn't red and green chocolate chip Christmas cookies be great in your Christmas cookie tins?
So yeah they just got done and wow-they are amazing! Happy baking all!

The dough was a pain to make by hand, and there seems to be too much chip, and not enough dough.

Delicious! Even my one year old loved them and kept trying to get more. Next time I would make my own dough and skip the store bought mix but that is just personal preference.

I love Mint Chocolate Chip Icecream and these cookies taste exactly like it but in a cookie!  This is a very simple easy recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but I may try dark chocolate chunks next time.  A+

Since I didn't have the store bought cookie mix I used a sugar cookie recipe of my own.  I also used Andes candies chopped up and mini chocolate chips.  The cookies turned out crispy and flat but delicious.  My husband said they could easily become addicting.

taste similar to girl scout thin mints...are very pretty and would look great on Christmas cookie platter with other cookies... weirdly had a hard time finding andes mint chips and mint flavoring...found at a super walmart...the local publix, krogers and little walmart didn't have.. I think the andes mints and chocolate chunks make the cookies special...

Yes, yes and YES!  This cookie recipe is awesome. For future reference, if you're making a bunch of different cookies (ie Christmas cookie bake off) and you're combining different cookies in the same tin, the mint will permeate all of the cookies and give them all a hint of mint.  These require their own container! :)  DELICIOUS!

These were excellent.  They are also very pretty.  My husband said several times while eating his first cookie how much flavor they had.  Definitely a Christmas staple.
