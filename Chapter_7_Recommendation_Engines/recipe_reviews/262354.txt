Easy, yummy and versatile.  My seven year old daughter did the dredging and coating, I did the frying.  Gobbled them up.  We used just panko, salt, parmesan and garlic.

I just made these tonight for my vegetarian daughter.  I did use storebought Italian  breadcrumbs instead of making them myself, but the cooking technique is great.  The tofu had great texture and she gobbled them up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved these. I used whole grain gluten free toasts instead of bread. The flavor is very nice. Using frozen tofu is my new go-to method for tofu. The texture was chewy, like biting into a chicken tender. Not a fan of rosemary, I subbed mustard seeds. Thank you for the recipe.
