A great, moist coconut cake, it made a big hit at work.  I read member comments and modified the original by reducing sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and also added a box of vanilla instant pudding, 1 tspn of vanilla extract (in addition to the coconut), 1 tspn of baking soda, and a small can of (drained) crushed pineapple.  It was done in 50 minutes, and came out of the pan perfectly.  I glazed it with warmed (microwaved) cream cheese packaged icing, then topped it with coconut flakes.   Yummy!

I hate coconut, but I wanted to make this cake for a friend.  I am puzzled by the reviews that said they had a hard time getting cake out of pan?  The one seasoned baker said the cake needed soda.  Why did the majority of the cakes turn out perfectly (mine included)?  Did they use buttermilk that was lowfat?  Coconut not mixed in well? (I added mine to the flour mixture). Sugar and butter not mixed long enough???  According to my friend and my family, it came out moist and wonderful.  Anyone have an idea?

I think that this recipe has the potential to be really great but its missing something. I bake all the time and I was very sad when my cake didn't rise. It was very packy and like others the top cooked first and it was hard to get out of the pan and had this greasy texture to it. After searching high and low for a coconut cake and consulting with other baking friends I think that baking soda is what is missing. Will try again in the future.

Wow! I made this cake at home for my Easter dinner. I drove 230 miles with it in the backseat of the car.  It was easy to pack and everyone loved it.  I didn't put any frosting on it, but I did change a few things.  I used cake flour, I put the flake coconut in the food processor for a minute, and I used coconut milk.  Did I get a piece of cake? No, I just enjoyed everyone telling me what a wonderful cook I am.  Thanks Dannis!

Great flavor, Dannis. The ladies at my church luncheon really went nuts over this cake. I added a 3.5 ounce box of instant coconut pudding to the mix, and whirled the coconut in my food processor to avoid the "chunkiness" of the coconut. It made for a luscious flavor and texture. Thanks for sharing.

I loved this cake! I was happy to find a coconut cake that didn't require a mix! I cut the sugar by 1/3 cup.  I made it in two 9" rounds and it made a beautiful layer cake.  A couple of things to keep in mind - this cake is dense - but so delicious.  Another thing, you really do need to grease your pan(s) well.  One of my layers came apart, so I did some restructuring.  The pan that I greased really well came out perfectly.  I got so many compliments on this cake - thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe, since I found it, I have made more than I can count. I always take at least two to work and leave one at home. I add vanilla extract, sometimes half teaspoon more coconut extract or pina colada flavoring,fold crushed or chunk pineapple into the batter, and BAM! Then, use a rum glaze and oh boy! I have joined the health club because of this cake, oh yeah, I cut out the flakes for those who don't like them and it is still wonderful, moist. I am trying to make a perfect chocolate rendition because it is so moist and tender!

Very good!  I loved it, and so did everyone else (that likes coconut).  It tastes best the first day or two - the taste and texture deteriorates a bit after that.  I couldn't resist eating some warm out of the oven.  Awesome!  I ought to mention that I used natural dried grated coconut, not angel flake, so it was in tiny pieces, and unsweetened.  The recipe seems to be intended for this type of coconut.  If you use the grated coconut, you will not need to cut back on the amount of sugar, or chop the coconut in the blender.  I hope this helps someone!

This is too sweet for us!  I have to cut down the sugar to three quarter cup but I'm using sweetened flaked coconut, otherwise this cake is truly very very good, moist and delicious!  Worth trying!

My rating is with these changes. After taking other reviews into consideration and a few alterations of my own, I think these substitutions make the best cake: 4 eggs 1-1/4 cup sugar 1 tbsp coconut extract 2 cups coconut apple sauce instead of butter  coconut milk instead of buttermilk  3/4 tsp baking soda  3/4 tsp baking powder Chop coconut in hand blender. Best if made in 2 layers.  For frosting: make pudding and set aside, seperately melt dark chocolate with remainder of coconut milk. When cool, add pudding mix (just powder). Mix this mixture into pudding. Or: Beat cream of coconut with cool whip and pour over cake. Cover with shredded coconut.

Coconut lovers will enjoy this easy to make, tasty, very moist cake. My family enjoyed this cake, but did comment that it was very sweet. I think I will cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time I make it and eliminate one egg.

Made this for Easter Sunday...was very good.  Had several requests for a chunk to take home and a request for the recipe.  I didn't use nearly as much coconut as called for because I wasn't sure everyone would like the strong coconut influence...and was great anyway.  The longer it stays in the fridge, the better.

This cake is fantastic! I made it as a two-layer cake with coconut-cream cheese frosting (also from this site) for a friend's birthday and it was a hit with all the guests. Like other reviewers I only used 4 eggs and substituted vanilla extract for coconut flavoring because I didn't have any. Also used homemade buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 cup of milk.

I found this cake to be pretty tasty but I had the same problem some others noted in that the cake did not rise.  I think my baking powder was pretty old so that may have been the problem.  The cake was very dense but good anyway.  I made the same changes suggested by others - reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, used only 4 eggs and put the coconut in the food processor before adding to the batter.  I also substituted coconut oil for the butter, which helped boost the flavor.  Will probably try it again - with a new can of baking powder this time!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I was not a big coconut cake lover but I wanted to try this recipe. I am so glad I did! It came out very moist and delicious. I did not have the coconut extract so I subsituted vanilla instead. It still came out great. Thanks Dannis! I will definitely make it again!

I am not as impressed with the over all out come of the cake. My first problem was that the recipe did not include an icing recipe. Then the cake seemed not to rise as well as it should and I even lined my tube pan with waxed paper to keep it from sticking and it was a little stuck to the waxed paper. I was making this for a co-worker of my husband and was not sure if I wanted to give it to him or not.

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I made sure I cream the butter and sugar until the sugar was disolved, then added the eggs one at a time until they were completed incorporated. I added the extract to the buttermilk and mixed a little flour into the egg mixture then a little buttermilk, etc. I did add a chocolate glaze to the top and sprinkled with more coconut. 10 stars.

I had to change this a little because of what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup milk with 1 Tbsp. vingegar to substitute the buttermilk and only used 1 cup of sugar, as I didn't want a really sweet cake.  I also pulsed the coconut in the food processor for a few seconds.  That being said the cake was good.  The flavor was nice, but it was very crumbly.  I made 2 8" rounds and split them to make a layer cake and they were falling apart as I split them.  I frosted the cake with a white chocolate frosting and added toasted coconut between the layers with the frosting.  It tasted good, but fell apart as I was cutting into it.

Really, really good!  I think it needs a touch of vanilla, but other than that, it's pretty darn good the way it is.  Holds up really well - used it as the base of a wedding cake.  Best a day or two later.

Ridiculously, amazingly good. Used a bundt pan and it came out perfectly. Frosted with vanilla cream cheese frosting and topped with toasted coconut. Will use this as a base recipe for future cakes also (sub vanilla extract and omit the coconut in the batter...easy!). Not low fat, but who cares when it's this good?! :)

I love this cake! I have made this cake a couple of different ways. I cut the sugar by 1/2, use 1/2 cup coconut oil in place of the butter and also add 1 cup light coconut milk instead of buttermilk. I also only use 4 eggs.  The first time I did not put coconut in the cake and my family loved it. The next time I used light coconut cream and half milk instead of buttermilk and added 1/2 cup of coconut flakes. The coconut flavor is amazing.

Turned out PERFECT!!! I used 4 eggs, regular milke instead of buttermilk, and self-rising flour so I got to leave out the baking power and salt to make the recipe easier. 
I took it to my grandpa's 93rd birthday it was gone in 4 minutes. Everybody LOVED it!

This recipe came out perfect. I didn't have any coconut extract so I used vanilla. The top finished sweet, crunchy and a bit chewy, like to sugar carmelized. So, good.

7 6 10 Followed suggestions, adding a teaspoon baking soda, one less egg, half cup less sugar, half teaspoon more coconut extract, adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It stuck to the pan big time.  
I ended up mixing the cake & (cream cheese) frosting together.  I used a cookie scoop to tray them.  Drizzled melted chocolate chips (with a little shortening after it was melted) over & sprinkling with shredded coconut.  
The cake, before I crumbled it, was pretty good.  Sweet enough with reduced sugar.  I'd add the egg, too.  Mine was low in the middle (the part not touching the pan).  I think the denseness problem would be caused by not mixing enough between egg additions. I think the additional egg would solve it.  
I used a cup of unsweetened coconut & extract, but t still wasn't very coconutty-storebrand extract.  
The coconut babies I made were not bad.  I think chocolate frosting would have been better since it was more like a candy than cake.  Tasted similar to what's left in the cake pan after the cake is served.  :?  :)  They were pretty.  Served them on a silver tray.  Birthday candles stuck in pretty well.  They were still quite sticky so I dipped the bottoms in graham cracker crumbs.  Refrigerated them before & after scooping to help retain the shape. 
Oh, if you use the mixer when adding the coconut, be prepared to scrape it off your beaters.  Not a big deal, but realize it will need it.  And, an hour is too long.  'About forty five minutes in my oven.

just made this for my birthday. sorely disappointed. the only thing i did diff is subbed vanilla for coconut extract and used coconut milk instead of buttermilk - figured it would equal the same consistency and coconut flavor. but those changes didnt even matter, bc with 5 eggs.. thats all you could taste anyway. maybe it's bc i lean towards vegan and really only like eggs for their binding properties, but this was ridiculous eggy. and yes it is moist but thats only bc its so dense! (not in a good way) i pretty much had to shovel it out of the pan.

I made this cake for Christmas and it was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  Everybody loved it and put in their orders immediately.  My husband loved it, my dad loved it and I loved it, especially.  I will definitely be making this cake again real soon.  It was very moist.  I added a regular sized box of coconut cream Jell-O pudding mix. I will decrease the sugar, though, by 1/2 cup next time as well.  Other than that, it's a WINNER!!!!

This cake turned out so perfectly moist, and was a beautiful yellow gold on the inside. I doubled the coconut extract, made two rectangular layers, and spread Coconut Pecan Frosting I between the layers. I decorated it with toasted pecans and powdered sugar, and served it as a birthday cake to a friend (who is a big coconut fan). Coconut-'haters' were converted! Thanks!

I love this recipe!  It's fast and easy and comes out so moist every time.  I've made it 4 times already and each time I change it up a bit.  The first time, I added banana, the second I made a chocolate buttercream frosting.  The next I added almonds, and this time I added marshmallow and walnuts.  It's a great base cake that I will use again and again.  Next time I'm going to add pineapple!

This is a very moist cake, turned out great. I only had sweetened coconut on hand so I reduced the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Next time I will go down to 1 1/4 cups

I too cut the sugar down a half cup and baked in a bundt cake pan. Topped with a dusting of confectioners sugar. Really enjoyed this and will definitely make again. Perhaps I will increase the coconut extract a half teaspoon next time. Smells so good in the oven.

OMG!  What a great cake! Did as other suggested and put in two teaspoons of coconut extract. This was the only change I made. It was incredible!  Moist and full of flavor.  I put coconut cream cheese frosting on top with shredded coconut and it was a winner.  Will keep this in my book and definately be a staple for Easter in my house!

This cake was EXTREMELY dense.  I was frustrated because I had a difficult time getting it out of the pan (despite greasing and flouring well) and a difficult time frosting it.  It just wanted to crumble.  I didn't bake it any longer than it needed for the toothpick to come out clean.  I added every item as called for, and in order.  I'm not sure what went wrong.

This seemed a little bland to me so after tasting, I decided to top it with a lemon glaze (1/4c lemon juice, 1/2c sugar boiled).  That jazzed it up to an ok cake.

HECK YES!  This is what I was looking for.  I only used 4 eggs, added vanilla and cut the sugar by a 1/3 cup.  Next time I might add a little extra coconut extract.  I drizzled with a chocolate glaze - cocoa powder, powdered sugar and milk.  Thank you!  :)

My new favorite cake! I've made cupcakes with this twice. The first time I made a coconut cream cheese frosting which was a bit much. The second time I used chocolate frosting - delicious! My 3 year son prefers them plain and will eat 3 cupcakes in a row. People who said they didn't like coconut loved these. Amazing, wonderful flavor and texture!

I never really cared for coconut until I tried this recipe. But wow! It was really yummy! I make this all the time now. I bake them as cupcakes instead of a whole cake so I can make sure everyone gets a piece.

Not really sure what went wrong with this recipe.  I added all the ingredients, just as they were listed.  But I had an awful time getting it to come out of the pan (yes I thoroughly greased and floured).  Plus the cake had a greasy texture.  Not at all appealing.  I don't think I'll try this one again.

This was the best coconut cake I had. My frinds liked it, it was very moist cake but I cut the sugar and eggs as suggested by MARY DOMAZ. I also think I will cut the butter as well next time I will make it.

I love this cake.  However I went with the comments and reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, I also added one teaspoon to baking soda and one teaspoon of vanilla extract too. The taste was divine! However I don't know what I did wrong because the cake fell in the centre. Maybe it was because I used a deep pan? Definitely using this again. Thanks

I should have read more of the reviews first, but I followed it to the tee & it they did not rise, & the tops were crunchy & insides were dry.  They were missing something flavor wise also.  Some people said to add baking soda also & I feel that would have been a good thing to do.  Such a bummer.

Really enjoyed this cake. Used coconut milk in place of buttermilk, and a tsp of vanilla instead of the extract. Also frosted it with a coconut buttercream frosting. We thought this cake was perfect for Easter!

I thought this was DELICIOUS just make sure you GREASE and FLOUR the pan, because I accidentally flopped it. ALSO: wait until cool otherwise, it won't look too pretty. Otherwise; two thumbs up!

I made this cake for a friend of mine who requested something with coconuts in it.  I baked 2 cakes: a 7-inch and a 3-inch (round).  I cut the recipe in half.  Only had to bake it about 20 minutes in these types of pans.  Rises nicely.  I greased and floured the pans and the cakes slipped out of them very easily.  I used "best white icing ever" from this website and added a half-cup of finely grated coconut to it.  She loved it.  Oh and also, I used coconut rum instead of coconut extract because I couldn't find any.

This recipe makes perfect mini-cupcakes!  I have used this recipe for both bridal and baby showers.  However, I thaw a 6oz. package of frozen grated coconut to use instead of the flaked; I just prefer the texture.  The cake is so good, it doesn't even need frosting.  But I can't resist guilding the lily!

The cake was very moist and morish. Lovely the next day with a cup of tea or glass of cold milk. Did not use the coconut extract or salt and i used half fat milk and not buttermilk and it was still delicious. Well worth making.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the fact that I reduced the sugar by half because I don't like things very sweet and I added a box of vanilla pudding. I used a cream cheese frosting and unsweetened coconut flakes inside the cake and on the outside. Those who complained about a flat cake probably need to cream their sugar and butter longer. The cake was moist and perfect! If you want a super coconut taste you may want to add more coconut flavor because it was a mild coconut flavor.  Be sure to properly grease your pan because this cake can stick. I'm definitely saving this recipe for the future.

I don't usually follow changes made by other bakers until I've followed the recipe exactly, but 2 cups of sugar to 2 cups of flour seemed a bit much. I'm glad I did (only use 1 1/2 cups sugar). Cake was perfectly moist, not too sweet and even without the coconut extract (didn't have it; used vanilla), very coconutty. Watch the baking time; mine baked in 45 minutes. Definitely making this again!

For those of you whose cake didn't rise, make sure all of your ingredients are room temperature (take it out the night before), make sure you beat the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes, and fold in the coconut. Technique is everything with this cake. You might also want to check that your baking powder is fresh. This is a solid recipe.

I made this cake for Easter dessert. The flavor was good, but it was very dense and not as moist as I would have liked.  If I made it again, I would try with 4 eggs instead of 5.  I also added vanilla extract and baking soda as suggested by another review.

Made this cake today, with the exception of 4 eggs instead of 5, and added a package of coconut pudding, as recommended by others, I followed to a T! I'm not sure why people had a hard time as this cake came out awesome!! Moist as can be... Had no trouble getting it out of pans, I made it as a layer cake for my hubby's bday! He said hands down best ever and told me it's a must make again!!! Great recipe!! Thanks so much for the share...

I don't know what the fuss is about unless you purchased one of those cheap aluminum tube pans which are not made for genuine baking.  I also bake all the time and I had zero problem.  I made two of them at the same time...one in a 10" tube pan and another in a bundt pan.  My bundt pan is a good quality one and so is my tube pan. I used the spray with flour and butter in it for the pan and covered it thoroughly.  It is important to use enough to completely cover the pan.  Then I put it all in the pans and baked it for an hour and 15 minutes to ensure both were done.  I checked them both at an hour and neither was ready to remove. 15 minutes more and they were perfect.  I allowed them to cool in the pan enough to remove them easily and voila!  Two perfect cakes.  One for home and one for a friend.

Yum!  Just made this cake as cupcakes and they're delicious -- and I haven't even frosted them yet!  I baked them for 20 minutes which was perfect in my oven.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla because, really, vanilla makes everything better!  The coconut flavor is perfect, not overwhelming but flavorful.

My husband loves coconut, and I started making this cake for him on his birthday the year we met - I just popped it in the oven a few minutes ago for the seventh year in a row!  

The only modification I make to the recipe is adding a box of instant vanilla pudding mix to up the moistness factor.  It is definitely a rich dessert, so a tiny sliver is all I need to be full!

This was really great. I made it mostly word for word. I did add coconut extract 2T, and coconut instant pudding ( 2 small boxes), everything else exactly the same. I am not even a fan of coconut anything- i made this for a friend who is, but I loved it!

Very rarely will I give a five star rating.  This cake is amazing (and I've debated 4 or five stars).  Instead of butter, I used an equal part (1 cup) of unsweetened apple sauce.  The only butter that came in contact with this cake was the amount I used to grease up the pan (less than a table spoon) and I used Cane Sugar as my sugar.  I got so many compliments for this cake.  It is too bad I didn't make two ( as I have a mother's day event to go to today).  You can't help to want to eat more of this (and don't feel as guilty with the apple sauce... still a little guilty because of all the sugar). Yummmuy!  Will have to expirement more...  (Oh and I used unsweetened conoconut flaks if anyone was wondering).
She said to use a 10" fluted bunt pan but I only found 9" in stores... Used it, still had plenty of space.
Very moist cake.  Yumyum

The cake was very tasty but I was disappointed that it was dense.  I also had a hard time getting it out of the pan. I followed some of the recommendations by cutting back to 4 eggs and on the sugar by 1/2 cup. It came out good but the recipe could use some improvements.

Excellent! Great moist texture, not too sweet (I followed advice of others and cut sugar by 1/2 c).  This is definitely a keeper.  I also made a simple cream cheese frosting/glaze that went very well with the cake.  This will be a fun recipe to play with as it will make an excellent base for many variations.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will definitely use it a lot.

This cake was great!  The only things I changed were that I used vanilla sugar instead of coconut extract because I couldn't find any and used grated coconut.  It turned out perfect and very moist.  I put a cream cheese frosting on top and sprinkled with coconut.  I can't stop eating it!

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have coconut extract so I used 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  It had good flavor, but the outside of the cake came out a little crispier than I would have liked.  Still, I will make this again when I'm in the mood for coconut.

This cake is very easy to make, and it is moist and delicious.  I used 1-1/2 cups sugar as another reviewer suggested.  Next time I will use 2 teaspoons coconut extract, and I'll run the flaked coconut through a processor to see what happens.  I got a wild hare to make this about 9pm last night, and it went together so quickly that I was in bed by my regular time, with the cake finished and in a cake carrier, and the kitchen all cleaned up.  My cake baked in 50 minutes, but that's probably because my bundt pan is professional-grade heavy cast-aluminum.  In any case, I advise testing the cake at 50 minutes, because you don't want it to be dry.  I took this to an early morning meeting, and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I followed one suggestion and glazed the cooling cake with reduced apricot preserves, to facilitate a healthy sprinkling of additional flaked coconut.  I also put a small amount of coconut into the prepared pan, which I've done for other coconut cakes to provide a slightly caramelized crusty topping to the finished cake.  All in all, a great cake with lots of coconut flavor, nice texture and color!  Thanks!

The cake seems moist and flavorful, but even with Baker's Joy in a non-stick bundt pan, the cake stuck, which has never happened to me before. I took it out of the oven and let it cool for 15 minutes before trying to turn it out, which is also what I normally do. Also, there's no way this cake will fit into a ten cup pan -- I used it in a regular 12-cup pan, and it rose right up to the top. I thought it looked like a lot of batter, and I was wondering about the tablespoon of baking powder. Didn't overflow, though.

Because of the patches in the top of the cake, I melted 1/2 cup of apricot preserves with a little water, poured it over the cake, and covered it with shredded coconut, so it looks like a snowball cake now. Only other changes I made were to add 1 tsp of vanilla and I only had 3/4 cup of buttermilk so I topped it off with regular milk. That shouldn't have caused sticking. 

Tastes good, though. *edited to up the rating to four stars. The flavor was great and everyone raved. Next time, I will just prepare the pans differently.

Cream cheese frosting with coconut on top was a good idea.  The cake itself wasn't as moist as I'd hoped.

I didn't change a thing, except to use organic unsweetened flaked coconut. I would have cut back the sugar if I used the regular flaked coconut.  I baked it in two 9" pans. It was just slightly dry because I kept it in a couple minutes longer.  In my oven I should have taken it out at 27 or 28 minutes I think. Great cake though, everyone loved it.  I used the coconut buttercream frosting on this site, which was terrific.

I was really excited about this cake, and after reading most of the reviews, more excited.  No cake mix for me!!  I normally adjust recipes to taste, but this time, I took into consideration the many similar comments, too sweet, needed baking soda, sticky, very dense.  

I followed the directions exactly, but mine didn't rise much (my baking powder and soda are new) and appears greasy.  I will try this again but with less butter.  Tomorrow I will serve it at a luncheon dressed with whipped cream, toasted coconut and a strawberry, and hope it is better than I fear it will be.

With a few changes, reading other reviews and following strict directions this cake is AMAZING!!! Be sure that are required ingredients are at room temperature; just 4 eggs were enough; I made my own buttermilk by putting white vinegar in milk; sift in a box of cream of coconut pudding with your dry ingredients (yes there are little bits of coconut flakes that can just be tossed in after sifting); I used cake flour; and 40 -45 minutes for me gave a clean toothpick. I also used a cream cheese frosting and pineapple filling that I made by cooking a can of crushed pineapples (with the juice), 2 TBSP of cornstarch and 1cup of sugar for about 6 minutes while stirring regularly, after it cooled I used it on the middle layer, frosted the top with cream cheese frosting and dusted with coconut while leaving the sides bare. DELICIOUS!!!

This cake is holy  amazing to a new level - I’ve been baking gluten-free for 7 years and this is the first recipe that makes a legitimately fluffy cake (with some gluten-free flour mix tweaking)
- would absolutely recommend!! Goes great with whipped cream frosting. My mom, who eats like a bird, went for a third slice!

Followed the recipe as written except that I used 1-1/4 cups Eggbeaters to replace the five eggs.  After baking the cake for an hour and letting it cool in the Bundt pan for about 15 minutes, it wouldn't pop out of the pan when when I flipped it over.  So I had to cut it out in chunks.  Cake was light and fluffy, but the crust seemed a little tough.  Next time I'll grease the pan with Pam spray instead of the Smart Balance that I had used and maybe use a little more coconut extract.

I made the cake as written, but I did not use the icing.   I don't like all butter frosting.  I used frozen coconut and also added aboit 1 teaspoon additional coconut flavoring in the frosting and did not include pecans or other nuts.  I toasted coconut to place on top.  This cake was sold in a bake sale for $40.  I wanted to sit down with a fork and eat it all by myself!!!

Fantastic!  After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and it was just right.  I baked it in three layer cake pans (lined the bottom with waxed paper, greased/floured sides) and had no problem getting them out of the pans.  I used the Butter Cream Coconut frosting from this site (minus the pecans, since it was for Easter) and it was devoured.

This is a delicious cake. I made it for a friend's birthday and it went so fast that I should have taken a second one. I followed a suggestion of only 1 1/2 cups sugar and adding Vanilla pudding. It was moist and had a lovely flavour.
Next time...I'll make two...

I am OBSESSED with coconut, so when my birthday came around, I made this delicious coconut cake, and covered it with the buttercream icing recipe by Rick Mazzuca.

I thought this was a wonderful moist cake.  I iced it with coconut butter cream and added sweetened coconut to the outside.  I served it for Valentine's Day at a dinner party I gave and it was a BIG hit!  I will be keeping this recipe and definitely making it again.  I do recommend cutting parchment paper and lining the pan.  It makes it so easy to remove.

Really liked this cake.  Mine did not rise as expected but it was still very good.  I subbed heavy whipping cream for the buttermilk  which may have had an effect on the rise...not sure. I made butter cream frosting and sprinkled coconut on top. The cream gave it an extra rich flavor so it was served in small pieces but still didn't make through the weekend before it was gone.  Next time will add baking soda to see if it rises more to expectations.  If I can't get it to rise I'll just start making it as a sheet cake.

Don't think I will use this one again. The cake did not rise and the outside of the cake was almost burnt. I followed the directions to a "T" and I have made many cakes. It was as den as pound cake. I poked holes in the cake afterwards and poured a rum flavored glaze over it because I was afraid the cake would be too dry. Something seems to be missing from this recipe to cause the excessive browning and the lack of rising from the leavening agent.

I just made this cake and followed it exactly, except for grinding the coconut flakes down a bit as other reviewers suggested, and within the first 15 minutes of putting it into the oven, both pans overflowed and I had to go scrape the overflowed batter out of the oven and put the both pans on a baking tray.  I also reduced the heat to 325 deg.  I don't know what caused this, could be the 1 tsp of baking powder, the 5 eggs, or the fact that I didn't use a tube pan... whatever that is.  Regardless, I was quite irritated but I already started it and I'm not going to get those ingredients back so, irritated or not, I carried on.  exactly one hour later, they were done, There was a little bit more overflow but they did not balloon up like I was expecting.  I put the cakes to cool then tasted the bits of overflow and WOW!  So yummy!  The flavor is amazing and although it's pretty dense, it is most definitely moist. I also had a great deal of trouble taking the cakes out of the pans because of the overflow and I ended up "gluing" the cake back with frosting and it was very ugly LOL!  None the less, I will more than likely make this again but I would like to know why my cakes overflowed.  I might play with the amount of baking powder next time, after comparing to other recipes, might have to do with being in high altitude area, I don't know but I will figure it out.  The cake is very sweet so, I used a white frosting (the type with flour that you cook over the stove) that is not too

I made this cake and use recommendations of other reviewers. I used 2 9"pans instead of the 10" the recipe called for. Adjust your cooking time down to 40-45 minutes. I also added 1 pkg of coconut instant pudding and added 1/2 cup of coconut milk to the recipe. Finally, I used a processor to shred the coconut just a bit further. The batter is thicker than usual but it works.  It came out with a nice subtle coconut flavor & moist. I have a Kitchen Aide mixer so that always shortens the prep time.

Gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes but it was a hit. Did like some of the others suggested and added 1 tsp of baking soda as well as vanilla extract. I also used coconut milk instead of buttermilk and I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups. Did a cream cheese topping with coconut cream and put toasted shredded coconut on top. It was divine and everyone loved it.

Very good recipe - I didn't change a thing.  I baked it maybe 10 minutes longer than it called for, as my tester wasn't quite coming out clean at first. I used a glaze of confectioners sugar, a little evaporated milk and coconut extract.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great coconut flavour!   Cut back on sugar by 1/2 cup and whirled the coconut in the blender since I have a family member that doesn't like the coconut texture.   Froze the cake and then let thaw completely before dusting with icing sugar.   Took to a bbq and it was all gone at the end of the night.

I followed the recipe to the T. Room temperature and everything. First of all it only took 35 minutes to cook. It was really dense but had a good flavor. It flattened a little when it cooled. It felt really springy and bouncy when it was just cooked but then when cooked it turned harder and dense. I guess I was looking for a more spongy fluffy cake. This was more like a pound cake. Any ideas how to convert it to make it more airy and softer? Less flour?

I made the cake exactly as the directions stated. I baked it in a 9 x13 glass pan and reduced bake time to 45 minutes. It was perfect! Moist and great flavor. No need to frost this cake - the flavor is great on it's own.

Great recipe, and like most people commenting, the cake went quick. I made this with a few alterations being most of the family is gluten free. I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free flour in lieu of all-purpose. The other alterations are, 3/4 tsp baking powder, 3/4 + tsp baking soda, 1.5 cups of white sugar & 4 large eggs. I baked in (2) 9" baking rounds and made a cream cheese frosting to layer & cover. I then added shredded coconut to the frosting. It was dense, but delicious.
Thanks for the recipe and the various alteration comments made. It all has to start somewhere.

Coconut cake is probably my favorite. I made this recipe today and frosted it with coconut cream cheese frosting, then covered it with shredded coconut. This cake is extremely moist with a deep coconut flavor. It was beyond wonderful. I will definitely make it again and again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was a moist cake, but as others have said, it was missing something. I tried to find coconut instant pudding, but it isn't available in my area. I should of added vanilla instant pudding as others suggested. I would definitely make this again, but with some changes. I did cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. Overall, a very good cake!!

Tasty! this has a moist but very dense poundcake like texture. I followed the  recipe exactly minus half cup sugar and since I used two 7.75" oval Wilton pans it only needed 45mins at 325 deg. Personally next time I'd reduce the sugar a bit more because frosting would make it too sweet for my taste. The secret is to have the butter VERY room temp and creaming it with sugar for a long 5minutes, scraping the bowl in between.

I used Coconut mile instead of buttermilk. I think it tastes great but like the other person said, mine didn't raise in the center either.  Making scratch cakes can be tricky so I'm not surprised.  I probably wouldn't make it again because of the rising issue but that's the only reason.

I love coconut  but cheated a bit by using a box mix.
I would think Soft as Silk cake flour would be a better idea and if your worried about the sweetness , buy unsweetened Coconut in the health food section, Then add the sugar.    My ex always used that Unsweetened Coconut  in her  Coconut  Cream pie and German Chocolate cake,  and they were always wonderful, and everyone else thought so too

This cake was FULL of coconut flavor. It was very ,moist and all of my guests loved it. The only problem I had was that I cooked it in a rectangle pyrex dish. IT looked light and fluffy when i took it our of the oven, but fell shortly after. I am not sure what the problem was, but I will try the cake again in a bunt pan. All in all the taste was great, just what I was looking for in a coconut cake.

The cake was alright.  I think I'll keep searching.  If I try it again I'll take someone's suggestion of grinding the coconut in a food processor.

This cake was easy to make and very delicious, but whatever frosting I used with it was way too sweet. So I guess it's good to be careful when choosing a frosting recipe. It was kind of hard to get the coconut to stick on the edges but eventually it worked and everyone loved it.

I don't use coconut extract, so I just substituted vanilla. I also didn't have buttermilk so I made some by heating a cup of milk for thirty seconds in the microwave and adding 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I did this before I assembled the cake because it needs time to thicken. The cake rose perfectly and came out of the pan easily and it was very fluffy and sweet. Next time I'll use grated coconut instead of flaked just for a different texture.

This is a great recipe!  I topped the cake with a cream cheese frosting,  sprinkled with more coconut.  I'll definitely make this again.
