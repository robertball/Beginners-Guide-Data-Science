HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: Being Asian, cooking rice is a skill I guess you're born with because I totally don't see why ANYONE had issues with burning the rice, it being uncooked, soggy, or whatever.  I cook rice the same way each time, and it comes out perfect. In saucepan, combine rice, coconut milk, water, sugar & salt. Basically the liquids should reach the area RIGHT BEFORE your cuticle (middle of the white semi-circle on your finger nail but not reaching your cuticle).  This is also assuming you've got the rice in the pot leveled, and the tip of your index finger is touching the top of the rice NOT the bottom of the pan.  This is at least how I was raised to always know how much water to put in rice for it to always come out right. Bring to boil then simmer covered for 20 min. You cook until rice is tender.  After 20 minutes, if there is still liquid or a bit soggy, I turn up the heat a tad, cover, and cook until absorbed and fluffy.  It's not rocket science! Always works!  Nothing difficult! Then mix in almonds accents (found in salad section, basically a bag of seasoned almonds to top salads) which adds the right amount of flavor to accompany the coconut taste.  BTW, my husband was not a big fan of this.  I was, but I LOVE rice and the coconut flavor.  We ate it with some japanese wings.

I'll admit, when I first tasted this I was disappointed - it was very bland.  I think it smelled so good while it was cooking (honestly, it smelled like I was baking coconut cookies) that the mild, subtle flavor was almost a let-down. HOWEVER, as stated in some of the other reviews, this is supposed to be a dish that compliments other Asian cuisine, and in that respect it is a 5-star recipe.  Serve this with something spicy (I made it with Easy Chicken Satay and Baked Pork - minus the pork - Spring Rolls from this site) and it is perfection!  My guests raved about the rice and I ended up appreciating it more when accompanied by something spicy.   I used light coconut milk, and almost made a big mistake by bringing to a boil over HIGH heat (started to burn!) instead of medium heat, but caught it just in time.  My rice cooked in about 10 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

Rice Cooker!  I mixed the 1 can coconut milk, 1/4 cup water, 1 teaspoon sugar, salt together, then put 2 cups of rice in my rice cooker, poored the coconut milk on top of the rice, mixed it in the rice cooker, then added 3/4 cup water ON TOP of the rice because you need water on top of the rice in order for it to cook right!  It was great!!!!!!!!!  I changed the recipe just a bit to make it cook in the rice cooker, it was great!!!

I realize that this recipe is supposed to have a very subtle coconut flavor, but I was looking for a real bang for my buck since I was serving this with my Polynesian themed dinner, so for extra flavor I stirred in a few drops of coconut extract and a handful of sweetened shredded coconut.  With that it came out perfect- exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Tasty, pretty and fragrant, this is a beautiful Asian method of preparing basic rice. It must just be that our taste buds are unfamiliar with this combination of flavors that made this unappealing for us...purely a subjective thing.  I do think, however, that even in a general sense this would be much improved without the sugar.  As a rescue for the leftovers, a coconut rice pudding would have been fantastic. Unfortunately, hubs is not a fan of rice pudding, so the remaining rice went down the disposal. I did appreciate introducing something different to our palates, so no regrets in trying it.

I was curious about this recipe and decided to try it one night with some pineapple and apricot chicken.  My family loved it!  This is the only rice they want to eat now.  We have a lot of stir fry with vegetables and chicken, and if I don't make this rice, I get in trouble.  The only thing I will say is that I have never had to cook this rice for 18-20 minutes.  I start checking mine at 10 minutes, and it almost burns at 12 minutes.  Great alternative to plain white rice!

A lot of people said their rice didn't cook and I think it is water in their area, I noticed my rice recipes didn't work well in Washington, but always turned out in Arizona.  Here's what I did to make this recipe:.  Add one tsp. olive oil to a small pan with a tight fitting lid.  Heat oil and then add the rice, stir often for two to three minutes then add the sugar,water and coconut milk (I reduced the water by 1/4 cup, the liquid should be about 1 inch above the rice) bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cover for 20 minutes.  Perfect rice every time!

I made this exactly by the recipe...I though it was excellent and though the flavouring was perfect..I didn't think the coconut flavour would be bette rif it was more pronounced. I think it would be too overpowering that way. I made this is flank steak and grilled asparagus, it was super tasty. My boyfriend ate it for 3 days in a row...he loved it! Even though I didn't think it needed tweaking, I thought I would add my brothers (sous chef) solution to that. He said to make the rice with water as you normally would. Then simmer the coconut milk down to half. when it is really nice and creamy fold it into the cooked rice. He said that he holds more of the coconut flavouring that way.

I was surprised by this recipe...I was expecting a very strong coconut flavor and was a little disappointed to find out that it was so mild that it if someone else had made it, I would never have guessed that it had coconut in it.  I used light coconut milk, so maybe that was it.  HOWEVER, the thing that surprised me was that even though it wasn't very strong, my husband and I couldn't stop eating it!  It was delicious!!

For those of you who get brown or burned bottoms:  your heat is too high.  I have a gast stove, and even on its lowest flame rice will burn.  I have to take a burner stand from an unused burner and put it on TOP of the burner I'm using, to keep it to a low low simmer.  Be careful though not to overturn the pot!  My rice turns out perfectly.  One word of caution regarding Chef Joy's finger method of measuring liquids for rice:  that method can only work on the same size saucepan that she's using-which she doesn't mention.  If you use a larger or smaller size, the water level will obviously change.

Loved the aroma of the Jasmine and coconut combination. I doubled this recipe b/c I knew it wasn't going to be enough for our Sunday dinner/lunch next day menu... I will triple the recipe next time :-)

If you'd like to take this over the top, add a couple tablespoons of freshly grated ginger before cooking.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.

This recipe is great.  We have tried several others and they don't come out very well.  Use lite coconut milk for a lighter recipe , we like it best this way.

I used my rice cooker without modifying any ingredient amounts and this turned out fabulous. The only modifications were that I used basmati rice and I added a teaspoon of coconut oil. WOW! It was perfect with tandoori chicken. I don't know if it was the extra teaspoon of coconut oil that I added but the coconut flavor was there and the sweetness just right. Thanks for a great new side!

This went well with our teriyaki chicken.  I used basmati rice and added some butter.  My husband suggested using ghee (clarified butter) rather than regular butter to give some added flavor.  I may give his suggestion a try next time.  Will use again.  Thanks SILVREZS.

Wonderful!  Husband picked up the soy sauce bottle as soon as he saw the rice, so I told him to taste it first.  He did, said "This tastes like rice pudding," and put the soy sauce down.  I know I should have used light coconut milk, but I really love full-fat coconut milk - it seems to have so much more coconut flavor.  My only change was to cook it like I learned on America's Test Kitchen; bring to a boil, cover, simmer on low for 15 minutes, turn the heat OFF, and let stand, covered, an additional 15 minutes.  This works for me every time, with any steamed rice recipe.  It seems you can leave the pot on the turned-off burner indefinitely.  I served it with Sticky Chicken, a personal recipe I just added, and it was a perfect accompaniment.  I made the whole recipe, which left me with a ton of leftovers...maybe add a little additional sugar and some dried cherries?  Or pineapple?  Yummmm...
PS - Had for dessert tonight - chopped fresh pineapple and a packet of Splenda.  Delish!

I didn't like this recipe.  I thought it was too sweet and overpowered the taste of everything else.  Also, the rice was undercooked and sticky.  I tried adding a little more water to give it time to finish cooking, but it really didn't help.  I will not make again.

This rice recipe is absolutely delicious all on it's own - it's truly ASIAN coconut rice.  It's not suppose to taste like a pina colada, it's meant to have the subtle flavour of coconut. The other reviews ensured I alternate plans, but when I tasted it, it was heavenly and perfect, just as is...real Asian, not American Chinese.

Best rice EVER!! I used my rice cooker and did 4 cups of jasmine rice with 2 cans of coconut milk and 2-1/2 cups water (per rice cooker directions = 1-1/2 cups of liquid per 1 cup of rice). Perfect! Honestly it was the best rice I've ever had. I didn't add anything else except for the rice, water, and coconut milk (full fat) . Sugar & salt are not needed. Can't believe it has any negative reviews...I'd give it a 10 if I could. My whole family was impressed so this will be a regular for us!

My second try on this recipe was a success! After cooking the rice in the rice cooker, I cooked it again in a pan with oil, garlic and spicy anchovies. Served with green onions as toppings. Oh, we loved it!

Made this without the sugar (not necessary) and it is delicious. If you don't have jasmine rice, regular white rice will do (although jasmine is better!).

For those who say this has no flavor, the flavor is not supposed to be strong! It is supposed to be subtle and compliment like (Asian inspired) foods. (We had ours with chicken satay w/ peanut sauce.) And it is also not supposed to be sweet or like a dessert, so those who are looking for something like that should look elsewhere. ;-)

Mmmmmm!!!  So good!  It's a really subtle coconut flavor so it is great with satay or other main courses that have more flavor.  I did add a little fresh coconut (flaked) and a tad more sugar.  The whole family loved it!  This is my son's favorite recipe -- he begs for me to make this!

This is not "in your face" coconut, the coconut milk gives the rice a luxurious richness. I used chicken broth for the water, and basmati rice, very good, and a change from regular rice. Notice the subtle change in texture and slight flavor change. Those expecting a "coconut" flavor shoud add grated unsweetened coconut at the end. 

I make this to go with curry, it is so good.

I made this as written today as an accompaniment to Aminah Rahman's Chickpea Curry, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The rice cooked just fine--those who are having cooking issues need to modify their heat levels, I would guess--but it was bland. I'm fine with the very light coconut flavor, but there was something missing, perhaps because I usually cook my rice with butter. Next time I'll probably try sauteing the rice in a little coconut oil first; normally I do this with butter, and it adds a lovely depth of flavor.

This has a mild coconut flavor along with nuttiness of the jasmine rice.  I thought it was just okay but my 12yo asked for seconds.  I think next time I'll try the coconut lime rice recipe instead since it has more dimension which this recipe clearly lacks.  Just bland and boring to me.

I followed the directions exactly, because it's pretty much the same way I make my perfect rice: Mix rice and water, bring to boil, give it a stir, cover it, let it be for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes this was just a gloppy mess with crunchy rice. I guess the coconut milk doesn't allow the rice to cook.

Okay I used COCONUT MILK instead if of the can because I thought it was the same thing. It was so bland! I think the can would be much better.

We're hooked on this.  Used an electric rice-cooker and added the coconut milk toward the end of the cooking time and the flavor comes out more than when adding it at the beginning.  Skipped the sugar altogether. Served with Asian Orange Chicken from Allrecipes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is extremely good.  It's just like Ruby Foo's in Times Square serves it.  I added more sugar to the cooking process because I like my "sticky rice" a little sweeter.  You could also sprinkle white sugar on the rice once it's on your plate.  Bon Apetite!

Love this recipe. You can use lite coconut milk but the real thing is so much better. The few calories you save aren't worth using the lite. This is a recipe I have always made minus the sugar. Next time I make I will try with the sugar. To anyone saying it is bland its rice, rice alone is just rice it is the dish you make to go with that makes the meal. I also heat my coconut milk in the microwave for a few seconds just till it is lightly heated. I boil the water then combine the liquids and salt give a little stir to combine then add rice cover and simmer 20 minutes, check to see if liquid has all absorbed fluff and remove from heat and let it set for a minute or so. Also when cooking rice on stove top if you gently turn the pot a quarter turn every 5 to six minutes during cooking it cooks more 
evenly. Thanks for sharing recipe.

This was great! The only thing I did differently was use an 1/8 teaspoon salt instead of a pinch.  Chaokah brand coconut milk was nice and creamy!  This rice had a subtle flavor, yet a luxuriously rich feel, almost like a rice pudding. A definite keeper!

I am first going to premise this review with the fact that I used light coconut milk, which may or may not have affected my results. I do want to use this recipe again, but next time I will use a little less water. Also, make sure you stir the rice before right before it boils otherwise you will end up burning what is on the bottom. Luckily, I realized this before it happened. Secondly, like other reviewers stated, there isn't much flavor (again, it may be because of the light coconut milk) and the coconut rice that I buy from my local oriental restaurant is sweeter. I might try adding a little more sugar the next time as well. My husband really enjoyed the stickiness of the rice because it made it easier to eat with chop sticks. The rice was also much better the next day and was a great compliment to the pineapple stir fry with mango sauce that I paired it with. Thanks for the recipe! I hope my feedback helps. Enjoy!

I liked the "idea" but did not want the high saturated fat content of coconut milk. I used coconut water for all the liquid (omitting sugar, c. milk, and water). I also added some fresh grated ginger. The rice had a slight sweet taste to it and went well with Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs. My man doesn't like "plain" white rice, but loved this. FYI, Coconut water is high in potassium and vitamin C and has 0 fat.

Excellent recipe! I bought some very good Californian Jasmine rice that I have been really loving, and it went perfectly in this dish. I liked the subtle coconut flavor that it offered, and it went well with a coconut chicken dish I made also from this website. I will be using this as a staple side dish, thank you!

This came out really good!  I had some toasted bits on the bottom of my pan but the rice didn't burn, which is a good thing!  I added a pinch more sugar at the end but otherwise didn't change the recipe.

I have made a similar recipe for a long time and always use my rice cooker.  For 1 1/2 cups of uncooked rice use a can of coconut milk (I use the light version) plus enough water to make 2 cups of liquid.  comes out perfectly every time and every one loves it!

Delicious & simple - will definitely make again.  I initially used regular white rice (no jasmine onhand), and gave this a 4; however I splurged on jasmine rice yesterday and made the recipe as written tonight.  Now definitely a 5!

Made the recipe Sweet, Stick and Spicy Chicken to go along with it and it was just delicious!

Maybe it was the type of coconut milk we used, but it was missing a certain kick to it. I would have preferred something a bit sweeter, but the texture and stickiness turned out beautifully.

This recipe will burn if you add sugar to it. The measurements and cooking method is traditional for rice but sugar burns easily and is what causes the rice to burn. I only rate the recipes as is so this is why it only gets 2 stars. My suggestion is to add honey to it when you fluff it or just don't add sugar or salt (since the salt is there to bring out the sweetness of the sugar).

This is now my mom's favorite rice and she requests it all the time. Leftovers (if there are any) make an easy desert with a little milk or cream and some cinnamon sugar. I have had trouble with it scorching so I do usually stir it periodically.

I made this rice with a citrus chipotle marinated chicken . I anticipated it to be bland and wanted a slightly sweeter flavor, so I opted to use pineapple infused coconut water and added finely chopped fresh pineapple . It was delicious.

In order to give the end result a more intense flavor, I added unsweetened coconut creme/manna while cooking. It has some coconut oil in it,so it also provides flavor and creaminess. Lastly, if you really go coco-NUTS, garnish lightly with toasted unsweetened coconut. Iwould also strongly suggest omitting the sugar from the entire recipe. Good luck -Mian

Since I ran out of coconut milk, I happened to have a concentrated paste for coconut horchata. I used mostly water and in place of the 14 oz of coconut milk I used whole milk and added the concentrate. I then took a spoonful of coconut oil with natural curry flavor (while it was hardened) and threw it in the liquids. I took a handful of dried coconut and threw it in there with the rice. Unfortunately, I was the only one who liked it. My husband doesn't like anything with coconut and the kids thought the rice was too "perfumey."

I've never had "Asian" style coconut rice, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  This reminds of the flavor of Jamaican rice & peas, just minus the "peas".  The coconut flavor is subtle, as one should expect with coconut milk.  I found that adding some additional salt gave it the flavor I was looking for.

My rice came out pretty good, I was concerned it was going to be gluggy but the excess seemed to evaporate into pretty fluffy rice.  I did add a drop or two of coconut extract as a test and a little grated ginger, but I like it either way to be honest.  The only thing I definitely changed was to add only a pinch of sugar (the brand of coconut milk I have is quite sweet) and 1/2t salt.  My rice took about 15 minutes to cook on a really low simmer, I found the amount of liquid was just right as I used quite a wide based pan so the rice was a thin layer.

Quite good but needed more salt. I also added in red onions but I think green would be better for colour. Thanks!

Excellent! Made it exactly as the recipe states.  Made it to accompany Asian Beef with Snow Peas from this site and that was an excellent pairing.  Will definitely make again!

This gets 5 stars from me easy! Cooked it in the rice cooker and used basmatti as that is what I had. 
Tossed in a 1/4 cup of sweet coconut flakes and omitted the sugar. I loved it!

This is a super side dish.  For those in my family who are not keen on coconut they loved it.  The only realy change I did was bring the water and coconut milk to a boil before I added the rice.   I used a long grain rice.

This is a good, basic Coconut rice recipe. It pairs well with 5-Spice Chicken (Rachael Ray recipe). My kids absolutely love both!

I suppose there's so many different reviews on this recipe because a majority of people don't know what the proper additions are to coconut rice. If you think you'll get the answer in this review, you are terribly mistaken. I find how you make the coconut rice itself will dictate what should be served with it.  If you want to omit the salt and rice I'd suggest eating it with chicken or another meat. If you'd like to try this as a dessert then keep the sugar (maybe even add more to your liking) and top it off with sliced almonds, ripe mangos, kiwis, mandarin oranges and pineapple. I like making almost a casserole with these latter ingredients and serving while luke warm(with a dash more sugar to give it a more dessert-like flavor). But really this recipe is the perfect one to play around with because the outcomes are endless!

Loved this.  Was perfectly flavored.  I served it with a lighter version of Indian Butter Chicken and it went awesome together.  I used light coconut milk and added some chopped cilantro just before serving.  So yummy!!!

As a dinner guest put it it should be called Amazing Rice!  I added some crushed red peppers when fluffing rice so it had a nice sweet and spicey taste.

I made this to go with a chicken satay and syrian green beans from this site and it was amazing!  My kids loved it, which is a huge endorsement from picky toddlers!  I was hoping this wouldn't be dessert sweet and it wasn't it was a great side dish for a bolder flavored main course.  I did use light coconut milk and a heavy pinch of salt.  It's very subtle and comforting!  If one wanted more of a dessert you could up the sugar considerably and maybe add more milk at the end.

I'm giving this a 5 because I don't want to mess up the ratings. I substited brown rice and it was awful. just wanted to warn other cooks. I'm sure it's fabulous with jasmine rice.

I really liked this recipe but I did change a few things.  I added extra sugar and made this into a dessert.  I cooked the rice as directed and then chilled it while I made a coconut syrup.  I topped the cold rice with coconut syrup and fresh mango.  Absolutely divine.

Tasty, but could have used something...some diced onion maybe.  Tried it a second time and added a bit of sliced green onion when presenting - it made all the difference in the world!

My family and I loved it! The rice has a slight hint of sweetness. I cooked this dish in a rice cooker. To make it was very easy and fast!

I made it as a side dish to Braised Tofu ( http://maindish.allrecipes.com/AZ/BrisdTf.asp ). The two flavors go extremely well together. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used equal parts coconut milk and jasmine rice (well rinsed and drained), doubled the sugar and salt amounts and added sliced green onions. It made for a lightly scented rice. Heat the coconut milk to barely a simmer on medium-low (do not let it roll to a boil because it will rise out of your pot!) and add the rice. Cover, let it come to a boil (a few bubbles), turn the heat down to low, and let steam for 10-15 minutes. Perfectly steamed jasmine rice :)

This was easy and delicious. I added some lime zest to it, which gave a subtle kick to the smooth coconut flavoring. We will have this often.

The directions are just right.  The rice was fluffy and fully cooked.  I made it without the sugar and, for us, it was perfect!  As someone else noted, it's far more fragrant while cooking than the resulting subtle flavor but that's appropriate for a side dish (not a dessert).  I can't wait to try it with Indian entrees.  Yum!

The flavour is solid, but I was looking for a more pronounced flavour. Will try some of Tina C's suggestions next time. First time I've done rice stove top in a few years, and I know I'll be doing it again.

This recipe turned out perfect for me!! Yummy. I paired it with Spicy Chicken Teriyaki & Stir-Fried Cabbage. I know a lot of people had trouble with this recipe here are some tips. 
1. I used bottled water (only because I have well water at home and hate cooking with it) 
2. Whenever I cook rice, I use 2 parts water and 1 part rice. So if you are using 2 cups of water use 1 cup of rice or 4 cups of water use 2 cups of rice. So instead of the measurements listed I used additional water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, coconut milk (I used La Preferida Cream of Coconut) and olive and brought to a boil. (DO NOT ADD SALT YET)
3. Once boiling add the rice. Stir a little and reduce the heat. Cover 
4.You will see the water reduce. Once the water starts dissipating reduce the heat to real low.  
5. Once the rice seems to have all the liquids dissolved, take cover off and taste. At this point, it should be cooked thoroughly. Add salt or butter to your liking. 
Hope this helps! Enjoy :-)

Good rice for a spicy dish like Spicy Orange Zest Beef . If coconut milk isn't available, but coconuts are, make your own. Grate fresh coconut and put in a pot, pour boiling water over it ( 1 C pulp to 1 C water ) . Let it soak for 5 to 10 minutes and strain through cheese cloth. Repeat and combine extracts. The first time will give you something approximating coconut cream, the second more like coconut milk. I find adding the two todether is right for my taste, YMMV.

I don't know who says this rice isn't bursting with flavour because it totally is! I used full fat coconut milk and 2 cups water instead of 1 and 1/4 and used an electric rice cooker. I combined all the ingrediants, and it cooked in less than 10 minutes. I was shocked at how awesome it was and I have tried many many variances of coconut rice.

I really liked this recipe.  It smelled really good but I do admit it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I added some shredded coconut in with it in the beginning.  It made it much more flavorful.

I used lite coconut milk but I am a sweet tooth so I added some sweetened flaked coconut (about 1 Tbs.) I also took another reviewers advice and simmered the rice for 15 minutes then covered and turned off the heat and let it sit for another 15 minutes.This will be the only recipe I use for making rice from now on. I love coconut! thanks for the recipe.

This is a fantastic rice recipe and so easy to make.  After reading the reviews I followed the recipe exactly (except for using light coconut milk to cut back on fat) and it turned out great.  I accompanied the rice with Hot and Sour Chinese Eggplant (from this site) and the combination was fantastic.  Thank you for such a great rice recipe!

Just made this to go with Mango Curry Chicken. It is so good I just want to keep eating more and more! There is a lovely coconut fragrance as the rice is cooking, and the taste is very subtle but so rich. I followed the instructions as written and did not have any problems. I have pots with glass lids, so that has really improved the outcome of my rice attempts. I just tilt the pot while keeping the lid tight so I can see how much liquid is left. When there's no more pooling and the timing is about right, I'm never disappointed. This is by far the best rice I have made.

This would be very bland on its own, but was perfect when paired with zesty thai chicken. I followed the recipe to a T, and added chopped chives when served. Will make again to accompany something spicy.

Didn't have jasmine rice at the store so I had to use white rice.  I thought it was yummy, kind of turned out sticky like I was hoping it would, definitely will try again with jasmine next time.

This was a really good recipe, but not worth all the fat grams!  I used low-fat coconut milk, and topped it off with toasted coconut and toasted macadamia nuts.  Everyone liked it, even the coconut-haters!

This reminded me of the coconut rice from the Thia resteraunt I used to go to, it is delicious! Try it with a mango thinly sliced on top after the rice has cooled down. You will love it! The sweet and sour balance each other out and it makes a great dish to serve on a hot summer day.

I made this rice as directed and didn't find it to be very good.  Unlike some of the other reviewers who said this was too sweet, I found it to be somewhat bland.  I was trying to eat this as dish by itself, but I really think it would work better with a spicy dish served with it.  As far as the recipe goes, I had no problems with the rice not cooking in the right amount of time or being too sticky, etc, but I don't know that I would make it again.

Thi dish was just okay.  I think you really have to find the right main dish to pair it with in order for it to work.  I found it to be rather bland (coconut flavor was very subtle) and it sat heavy afterwards.  I tried it both warm and cold.  Personally, I preferred it cold, but at that point would rather have rice pudding than this mixture.  I added extra sugar from 1 tsp to 2-3 tsp, but other than that, kept the recipe the same.  I don't think I would make this again because of how heavy it felt after eating.  Not worth all the calories and extra fat.  but it was fun to try something new!!

I made this once in a rice cooker, and it was awful - my cooker didn't cook it thoroughly and it turned into slop.  I tried this again on the stove and it came out great!  I used lite coconut milk and added 4 tsp of sugar.  I served this with Grilled Tandoori Chicken also found on the site.  I'll definitely make this again.  I went to a restaurant that also served coconut rice, but I think as a finisher they added a tablespoon of coconut milk on the finished rice before serving - I'll have to try that next time to give it a stronger taste and different texture.

I loved this rice and so did my boyfriend. It has a very subtle coconut flavor, and pairs well with spicy dishes. I tried low-fat cocnut milk and it worked out fine. I added a bit more sugar than asked. The biggest difference is that i let the rice simmer for 45min-60min. 15-20 min is not nearly enough time!

This recipe was creamy goodness! My whole family loved it. The only change I made was to add one chicken bouillon  cube with the water and coconut milk. That really cut the sweetness of the coconut milk in a yummy, savory way. I made this rice along with Spicy Eggplant and Thai Ground Chicken Basil, both from this site. The eggplant was to die for with the rice. I just devoured the very tiny bit of leftovers for lunch.

Yum!  Sorry but all I had was brown rice.  4 cups water to 2 cups brown rice.  Used your recipe but microwaved 15 minutes covered  and 20 uncovered.  Perfect!   Served under Crockpot Butter Chicken. Oh my! Heaven on a plate!

I added a little bit of grated lime peel to the mix before boiling/cooking the rice and it really brought out the coconut flavor and made it truly delightful! What a wonderful, tropical side dish! I paired it with a chicken sate with peanut sauce--yum!

I've made this recipe, and also had some problems, but it's not with the recipe, it was with the rice. I'm on a fixed income so have been buying my rice from one of those discount, bag your own groceries, stores.  I've discovered that the rice they sell is more adapted to risotto. It doesn't say it's Arborio, but that's how it needs to be cooked. It took me a few times to realize what I was dealing with. I followed this recipe exactly as written, but only had 1 can of coconut milk, so at the end of the stated cooking time had to add more water, and have had to repeat that, 3 times so far. I will not eat either my rice or pasta 'al dente', I like it 'cooked'. Needless to say, there was no coconut flavor left at all. This scenario may be the reason other people have had problems. Sooo, to 'chef Joy' there may be extenuating circumstances as to why some people have had problems. Needless to say, I'll go back to buying 'regular long grain rice' at my more expensive supermarket, but will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. It was fantastic. We had it with citrus salmon and orange-cilantro coleslaw. My whole family loved it! It cooked perfectly and was light and fluffy. For those who want more coconut flavor, I accidentally used coconut cream instead of coconut milk. It had a wonderful coconut flavor that might be more pronounced than with just coconut milk. This will definitely be added to the rotation!

WOW!!!  If I could give this more stars I would; and I am a coconut hater through and through. I made it exactly as written. I found it had a tendency to stick to the bottom while cooking so I gave it a few stirs and it was fine. Just keep an eye on it. Yes I know lifting the lid while cooking rice is against the rules :-) Wonderful recipe! I will definitely make this many more times.

This is a great recipe! I added a 1/2 celery stock, 1/2 diced onion and handful of cilantro into pot too (remove celery after cooked). IT was YUMMY!!!

Made the mistake of using a different type of rice for the first time with a brand new recipe.  I made double the rice I usually make and I think I used a pot that was too small for the amount that I made.  The stuff on the bottom was nicely cooked but the rice on top was crunchy.  mixed it around and cooked it a bit more which was OK, but could be better.  Will try again.  Nice taste!

Very good!  I toasted the rice first in coconut oil to add a little extra coconut flavor.  I added some sugar and more liquid (slightly more) then it called for.  Turned out very nice.

This was delicious. I cooked it in a rice cooker exactly to recipe instructions. At the end, I separated the grains with a fork and worked in 1/8 tsp of coconut oil which really made the flavour pop.

This was really nice, although I did the measurements just by going on what my bag of rice said, and substituting the coconut milk for water -- the can had two cups, and the bag called for 3 cups water for 2 cups of rice.  Worked out really well, and has a nice, soft coconut flavor... not overpowering at all.  Made this with the Asian Style Country Ribs recipe on this site and they went together great!

This makes the perfect coconut rice in terms of flavour. I make it in my rice cooker. When cooked in the rice cooker, there is too much liquid in the recipe, so I only add 3/4 cup of water, keeping everything else the same. Just like the coconut rice from our favourite Thai restaurant.

Both my husband and I loved this rice. The coconut is very light and the sugar doesn't make it to sweet at all. I will make it again soon! A little to calorie heavy though.

Pretty good!  I made it just as the recipe said, minus the jasmine rice, since my boyfriend can't have it.  I liked the light coconut flavor, but thought that it could use a little more sugar.  Maybe a 1/4 cup?  It tasted the best hot, but when I had the rice with milk, sugar, and coconut flakes this morning, it was also a delicious treat!  I will probably make this again.  I served it with the Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating, also from this site.

Made with basmati rice (as that's what I had on hand) and lite coconut milk in the rice cooker. Added a splash of lime juice and omitted sugar. Turned out great! Light flavor, which accompanied the chicken I made nicely, without overpowering. Thank you!

We thought this was wonderful! Made as witten, but I did think it could've used a little more salt, but that's my personal preference. I served this w/ 'Asian Lettuce Wraps' from here and it was a perfect match. Will definately make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious... did have to make a tweak b/c of it being damp still but not sure what normal is for this dish.  I served it with Easy Satay Chicken.

I made this rice in my rice maker so I heated up the water and sugar in the microwave to get it the sugar to melt before putting it in the rice maker.  I then mixed everything in the rice maker and let it cook - when I opened it up there was still a lot of coconut milk mixture on the top and when I mixed it in, it was a little damper than I expected.  Maybe it's because I made it in the rice maker and maybe it was supposed to be that way... I'm not sure. 
However, I cooked a 1/2 cup more rice like normal (in water) and added it to the mix.  This worked fine and it tasted great.  Next time I'll try it normal again on the stove and see what happens.

This was so easy to make. And I can usually mess up rice better than anyone! I have never been able to cook it correctly. This was great though. I added some chopped cilantro, and the color was nice and the flavor was great with the coconut.

I made this as a side dish to the "Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi" (also on this website) and I liked the rice sooo much more than the mahi mahi!  I followed the recipe as written but added about 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut after rice was cooked and just stirred it in plus I also added a small handful of chopped cilantro to the rice for added color and flavor.  Soooooo delicious!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

4 Stars because the cooking time was off for me. I turned the burner down to low after adding the rice and let it cook longer (about 30 mins). Low and slow so it wouldn't burn. Added a pinch of ginger, a splash of lime and served with Tropical Pork Chops from this site. Wonderful meal!

This recipe is good, but I like to add about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the dish after partially cooking the rice and I think that really adds to the flavor.

This rice is OK.  I lived in Asia for many years so I am particular about my coconut rice.  I could barely taste the coconut so I think I'd have to give this one a pass.

absolutely delicious. I had to use about 3/4 cup more liquid while cooking in low. needed to stir about every 5 minutes because it wanted to stick together but it came out beautifully. I tried it exactly the way the recipe call and it is 5 star. I usually love cilantro and toasted coconut but the little batch I tried with those added didn't compare to the original. Thanks for sharing

With a few minor modifications suggested by other reviewers, this was fantastic!  I added just a drop of almond extract to enhance the flavor and used basmati rice instead of jasmine.  When finished cooking, it stuck together nicely and tasted great. Will be making this again for sure!

Despite what anyone else may have to say about this recipe, me and my tastebuds loved it; ditto for everyone else at the table.  I had absolutely no problem with it cooking. The flavor was subtle and the texture was creamy. I love coconut rice, so am happy to have a recipe I can make myself. We have it with just about anything, spicy or not! Thanks for a great recipe.

I liked this rice very much.  It does create a quite subtle coconut flavor.  With regard to proportions, you basically should do what works for you.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups rice (washed), one 14 ounce can of light coconut milk, one cup of water, a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  It came out perfect.  Next time I will top it with toasted coconut like the last reviewer recommended.  I paired it with a stir-fry dish.

This was very delicious and the coconut flavor was very subtle. I made this with shrimp and sauteed mangos. Wonderful!

This rice was a great side dish for the kabobs I made.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the directions, but the rice was done after about 11 minutes.  I was glad I read the reviews and knew to check, or it would have been ruined.  But the taste was great!

I've never had coconut rice in restaurants, but I didn't care for this one.  I thought it was bland tasting.  I added two cans of coconut milk as I was cooking brown basmati rice and that needed a longer cooking time.  I couldn't taste the coconut really well.  It tasted like slightly milky plain tasting rice.  Sorry, but won't make this one again.

I didn't think this had much flavor.  It took a long time to cook, way longer than the recipe called for.  I also added milk because the whole thing was too dry while the rice was still uncooked.  My husband thought it tasted good but he added sugar to it after it was done.  I think to improve the recipe you would need to add more sugar while cooking, at least a 1 cup of milk and a tablespoon of coconut cream to the coconut milk.

Very subtle, tasty rice. It is missing something, though. Next time I think I will add a little more sugar and perhaps some coconut extract for a little extra flavor.

This rice is so good (and so not on the diet!!)  I also didn't have to cook it as long as the directions indicated though.  This was a great side dish for chicken satay or any other curry dish.

I loved this rice and so did my toddlers!  I agree with the other reviewer that the cooking time is too long though, mine gets done around 10 minutes.  Jasmine rice is our favorite and this is a great way to serve it.

This turned out great! No one here thought it was sweet and really not coconutty. My husband who burned out on coconut anything from growing up in the islands, even said he couldn't tell there was coconut in it and he was forewarned before he took a bite. I used lite cocout milk. We all had seconds. Like I said, this rice is great! I served this with yellow chicken curry and flour tortillas (I didn't have time to make naan or roti).

Remember, this is rice that you are supposed to serve with something else. It's merely a part of the main dish, so if it's a little bland by itself, that's okay. This went great with the ginger pork and vegetables I made. My son said he loved it which is a rarity. I only used about 10 ounces of coconut milk and added 4 more ounces of water to make up for it.

This recipe is fabulous!  Followed it exactly, and the rice was amazing. Turned out just like an entree I had in a little Thai restaurant in NYC.  I froze the leftovers, and it was great reheated too.

This wasn't a favourite of ours. The flavour was way too sweet, and the rice ended up going mushy on me -too much coconut milk?-. I won't be trying this one again, thanks anyways though.

Yummy!  Subtle, just the way I'd hoped.  Sprinkle a little green onion, toasted sliced almonds, or toasted coconut on top for texture and a little extra flavor.  Thank you!

Pretty good.  Mine wasn't as flavorful as I wanted it to be, but it's more than likely because I used light coconut milk, but I still liked it.  So I definitely recommend using regular coconut milk in the future.  My jasmine rice was from Thailand.

This rice was amazing, a great way to jazz up a boring side. I took the creamy oil from the top of the coconut milk and flash fried some scallops in it along with some chopped cilantro stems. The toasted coconut and frest cilantro is a MUST! Also, I don't know what jasmin rice you all use, but mine takes an hour to cook

My wife and I absolutely love this; it reminds us of many of the different rices we had while I was on duty in the Navy.  One thing that some people have mentioned is that the taste is subtle and they would like to increase the sweetness; I have found that substituting the sugar with a "raw" sugar (I use Maui raw sugar) rather than a refined usually does wonders to boost the sweetness when needed.

Ok I didnt have coconut milk so I used water and 1/2 tsp coconut extract.And added 2 tablespoons butter in the end to add creaminess. And it was really good. I made it with Blazing Glory Raspberry Chicken Breasts from this site. Yummy

Great! I used basmati rice instead of jasmine because thats just what I had in the house, but it tasted delicious! Great side dish to any chinese meal. I ate it plain, but I plan to add some mint out of curiosity tomorrow with leftovers ;)

This was fun and easy to make. You won't believe how soft and fluffy the rice is! I used lite coconut milk and served with soy sauce-marinated, broiled tuna steaks. I may sprinkle in a little  shredded coconut next time as it cooks because the flavor was a little faint - probably because of the lite milk substitution.

After reading a few people say it was a little bland, I upped the salt to 1 tsp.  I cooked it in my Instant Pot - 5 min. on high pressure then let it sit for 10 min. before releasing the steam.  It was perfect!  Tastes really good!

So...This is a great recipe that you can definitely embellish, as I did. I doubled the recipe (3 cups jasmine rice), and I used 1 can of coconut milk, 1 can of coconut creme, and then I topped the pan with water until liquid was roughly an inch above the rice, as suggested by Chef Joy. Then I took reviewer Kelly's advice and cooked for 15 minutes, turned the stove off and let it sit for 15. It was perfect. Three cups of rice and my family of four finished it--nothing left. I made it with honey-soy chicken thighs, and my oldest son complained there wasn't enough. Tonight I'm making the rice again and I'll embellish the honey-soy thighs into an orange chicken using fresh oranges and substituting orange marmalade for the honey. This is a fun recipe that you can mess around with to your liking. It's fool-proof, really.

We loved it served as a side with Asian Boneless Pork Ribs (recipe on this site). I used my rice cooker as another review had suggested it worked perfectly with 2 cups rice, can of coconut milk, 1 tsp of coconut extract, 1/4 c water added to the coconut milk-mix the coconut milk with the rice in the rice cooker-add 3/4 c water on top of the rice and set the cooker and walk away. talk about easy. Our 2 year old great grandson couldn't get enough.

Very good, made in my rice cooker. No extra sugar & I added 1 T of coconut oil and about 2 T flaked coconut. Excellent! Served with Baked Teriyaki Chicken thighs from this website. Superb!

Very tasty and simple. It goes well with spicy Thai curry dishes. Since we like it a little on sweeter side, I added a handful of sweetened coconut flakes.

Not much I can add to this! I have made this over 20 times, follow this recipe exactly, and have never had an issue. I always use a large stockpot to ensure that the rice doesn't burn and cooks through. Pairs with everything-- I've served this under fried eggs and bacon, grilled chicken, fish, greens...A great base for most dishes!

Easy side, a little dry.  Not a big coconut flavor to it, but it could be the brand of coconut milk.  I'd make it again.

I made this as written and it was amazing! I made it to go with jerk chicken. Perfect side for spicy dishes. My husband doesn't like coconut but loved this. Will be making again.

This rice was so moist.  Had a nice subtle flavor.  My family and I enjoyed it very much.  I did add a splash of imitation coconut flavor as suggested by another reviewer.  Will definitely make over and over.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for the first time. I served myself a small bowl and sat down to peruse the comments. I live in Tucson and my rice came out perfectly. While looking at comments, I ate the whole thing. I don't usually eat plain rice, I like to add butter or salt or soy sauce or broth or all of the above. This rice was yummy all by itself. Thank-you.

This was the best rice I've ever tasted. The coconut flavor was subtle, the rice cook perfectly, soft fluffy. I did add a little salt to the water before cooking. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

This was a completely FUN side dish! I served it with Asian Glazed Chicken that was infused with lots of ginger. I prepared it in our rice cooker and it came out perfect. I used enough liquids (water and coconut milk together), as I would use if I only used water to cook the rice. It came out so good and smelled fantastic. My husband loved it and usually only likes sweet coconut candies and desserts. This was perfect (not sweet) and I didn't have to babysit it while it cooked in the rice cooker. Also, the coconut milk had flakes of coconut in it which really made for an authentic coconut rice. Thank you so much Silvrezs!

So good, but even better if you use a can of coconut cream instead of coconut milk! (Can be found at your local Trader Joe's).  Add a little bit of sea salt to offset the sweetness of the coconut and you can pretty much just eat the rice as a meal in itself.

I absolutely love this simply recipe and my kids actually request this rice.  We like to serve it with grilled teriyaki salmon or any grilled fish.  If there are any leftovers you can add sugar and milk and cook over low heat for maybe 15 minutes or until slightly thick (rice will absorb milk), keeping in mind that it will thicken as it cools, and you have coconut rice pudding for dessert.

This is rather bland, but try adding a bit of toasted sweetened coconut on the top...adds a nice crunch and lots of flavor.  I have been making this for years and always comes out delish.

I thought that this rice tasted completely like coconut and that it wasn't too subtle! I absolutely loved it in the beginning, but the main dish I made was not tasty at all so it made it hard to keep eating unfortunately. I made this a little different just because I always make 2 cups of rice. other then that, the recipe was simple and yummy.

Really delicious and easy. Made it in the rice cooker on regular white rice setting, kept the same measurements, and it was perfect. If you have trouble cooking rice, get a rice cooker. I don't have the patience for cooking rice on the stove, I always check on it and it's either crunchy or mushy...no wonder the hubby bought  the rice cooker. We are making the recipe again tonight, so felt the need to review.

This is def. a very subtle coconut flavor. I used my rice cooker but kept all measurements the same. Good for a change of pace. Served with baked teryiaki chicken.

YUM! This was great! It didn't come out sticky or gluey. Whoever said it was too sweet probably didn't use unsweetened coconut milk. I didn't have any coconut and I don't care for cilantro, but garnished it instead with toasted sliced almonds.

I think I'm with some of the others in that I really couldn't taste the coconut milk.  It seemed like a waste.  The rice cooked perfectly, but I put all the ingredients in a rice cooker.  Not sure if I'll do this again, but if I do, I think I'll add flaked coconut to see if that brings out more flavor.

I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious. Perfect complement to the Asian Style Country Ribs from this site (thanks, Raffaelo, for suggesting this rice). I completely over-ate. Ahhhh...I am intrigued by the almond accents suggestion...may have to try that next time.

This was perfect to go with our meal of grilled shrimp with mango salsa.  My husband does not like coconut...in any fashion...but this was mild enough that he did not even notice and he ate seconds.  For those of you expecting more coconut flavor, you may have to 'kick it up a notch' with more coconut perhaps.

This was so good! I followed the recipe to the T and found it needed a little bit more time to cook. I thought it had a very nice coconut flavor,nothing lacking here! Maybe it depends on the brand of coconut milk you use. I will be making this again and again! I think I will try with some grated fresh ginger to give it alittle something different! Thanks for a awsome recipe!

This is about the way I make coconut rice except for the salt.  I actually really like the pinch of salt.  I put the rice in the rice cooker, and combine the rest of the ingredients minus the water in a bowl.  After stirring, I add it into the rice cooker.  Then I add water.  I've been cooking rice forever so I do not measure the water, just eye balling it.  Turns out great each time, but the pinch of salt makes it perfect.
For the reviewers who thought this was not sticky enough - you need to cook with actual sticky rice.  And while you can eat this coconut rice by itself, I think it's best served as part of a meal.

I enjoyed this and yes, the flavor is very subtle.  Most coconut rice isn't supposed to taste super-sweet.  I agree with a few of the other reviewers - it really helps boost the coconut flavor if you toss in a handful or two of shredded coconut at the end of the cooking time.  I used UN-sweetened coconut, because I didn't want this side to taste "dessert-y"; I still wanted it to be savory.  It also gives the creaminess a bit of texture.  Make sure you toast the coconut first - it gives it that nice, nutty flavor.  Thanks, Silvrezs!

We really liked this! It does have a pretty mild coconut flavor, but that's exactly what I wanted. I doubled the sugar because I wanted it to be a little sweeter. Other than that, everything else stayed the same. Turned out great.

So good with teriyaki chicken! I used my Pampered Chef Rice Cooker Plus (cooks rice PERFECTLY in microwave). Stirred all ingredients, micro on high 5 minutes, medium power 15 minutes. SO GOOD!

I made this and it seemed like it was lacking something. I added soy sauce at the table. Then I read MAWARNE's review and it all made sense. Can't wait to try it with sambal. Thank you for turning me on to something new!

The kids and I ate this and really liked it.  My hubbie wasn't crazy about it, but said it was ok.  Really, make sure and bring it to a boil over MEDIUM heat.  I think it would burn if on HIGH. It didn't take but 15 minutes or so at very low, and that's at high altitude.  Be careful or you may burn it.

I liked this coconut rise, but a bit to sweet. It reminds me of a dish my daughter had at a Thai restaurant, There is was served with steamed mango's. It was excellent. I am glad to have found a similar recipe!

I have made this recipe many times since I first found it. I like it with spicy dishes like jerk chicken. I make it exactly as the recipe is written and it comes out perfectly every time. The coconut flavor is subtle, but it's meant to be. I highly recommend this recipe. It's a staple in my house and everybody loves it.

My family loved this recipe. Even my hubby who doesn't really care for rice said he loved it and went back for seconds. The texture is different from normal rice but it's supposed to be. I did omit the sugar and felt it was great w/o it. Thanks!

The coconut taste is very subtle, but excellent.  My family absolutely loved it; it definitely goes well with a spicy dish.  I've made it over and over again since trying it about a month ago.

I made this rice to go with the Ham and Pineapple Kabobs recipe on this site.  The rice was good, but kind of bland.  I ended up putting the marinade from the Ham and Pineapple Kabobs recipe on it, which really helped.

I made this with one alteration.  I first sauteed the rice in 1 tablespoon of melted butter until the rice was golden and fragrant.  I removed it from the saucepan and then followed the recipes directions from the beginning, adding the rice back in later when called for.

I really enjoyed the subtlety of flavor in this rice and found it to be a great base for any Asian Style dish if you want to change things up a bit. I had it with Chicken Keleguin since I couldn't find a red rice recipe I trusted. There were plenty of leftovers, since there's only two of us that eat rice in this household, so the next morning I warmed it up added a bit more sugar, raisins, and cinnamon which made a nummy breakfast.

this recipe is very good. i followed the recipe almost exactly, but as another reviewer suggested, i only simmered the rice for about ten minutes. depending on your tastes, you may want to add a little bit more sugar for a more distinct sweet flavor. we served this alongside the ginger glazed mahi mahi from this site, and it was delicious with some of that sauce spooned on top!

We loved this.  I made it to go with Thai green curry chicken (jar from Trader Joe's) and it was perfect.  I used regular long grain rice and had none of the problems others had with the rice being sticky or underdone.  Will definitely make again.

I've had the real deal from street vendors in Malaysia.  This wasn't bad, but still not as sweet as what you get in the Far East.  I needed to add more water to get the rice to cook through.

This was just OK for us. It was quite sticky, and not as light and fluffy as I had expected (I would have just made calrose sticky rice if I would have known it was going to turn out that way). The flavor, while supposed to be subtle, was pretty non-existent for me (and I served it with a white fish with a fruit chutney, so I would have expected the coconut flavor to come through).

This was really too subtle for my tastes.  I added lots more sugar, a little cinnamon, and some toasted coconut and THEN it was great!

I omitted the sugar and it worked out great as a side dish for a thai themed dinner I made.  It does cook faster than stated though - approx 10-15mins.  Thanks for this quick, easy recipe.

i would have given this 3 starts except that my husband liked it and he's sooo picky. not very flavorful in my opinion. cilantro is a good addition. you must use jasmine rice or other asian variaties. don't use plain long grain white.

My favorite Thai restaurant makes this as a dessert topped with fresh sliced mango. This was close to that recipe, with a lot of added sugar. Try 1/2 cup - I enjoyed it, but it was still missing something.

Yum!  Made just like the recipe said, except left out 1/4 cup coconut milk & substituted water.  I used the excess milk in a sauce for Honey Ginger Shrimp (allrecipes also)which I served over top of the rice.  They were perfect together.  I would probably not serve this as a stand alone side dish though.

This was good. I like a bit more of a coconut flavor though, so I think I'll try adding a bit more next time. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this! Served it with Chicken Satay (suggested in earlier review). Did not garnish with cilantro or toasted coconut, and was still really good. Reminded me of a dish from a Thai restaurant that made it using purple and white rice which they garnished with sliced mango, finely chopped peanuts and cilantro. Definitely will make this again.

I made some Thai food the other night and this actually complimented quite nicely. Sprinkling with toasted coconut and cilantro is a MUST. A word of caution as well. Due to the sugar in the recipe, this has the potential to burn. I had to keep a close eye on the pot!

Great flavor, hubby would have given it a 5 stars. I felt like there was a odd after taste, but would have to try it again to make sure. It was a new and fun way to change a rice side dish. Paired it with "Chicken Satay" and "Best Peanut Sauce" from this site.

I thought this was a great recipe! Mine worked out just fine in terms of moisture etc... I did add an extra tsp of sugar (I have a sweet tooth) and used a can less 1/3 cup of coconut milk. (the 1/3 cup went towards the main dish I served with this rice which was South of the Sea Chicken and Bananas - fabulous combination!) and I added a touch more water in it's place. The coconut was very subtle but made the rice very rich tasting. I also added a little butter after it was cooked. The leftovers made a great rice and milk cereal dish (add milk to cover and microwave until the rice absorbs it, add more milk and serve as breakfast..sweeten to taste)
All around YUM!

This was very good. I served it with shrimp tempura. I added chopped carrots, corn and peas to the rice and cooked it all in my rice cooker. Very yummy. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Great if you don't like bland rice. The dish was sweet. I took another reviewers advice and added 2 Tablespoons of sugar. I also tried with lite coconut milk; I would use the regular coconut milk b/c it added more flavor. Good with tofu and veggies!

I had a can (5oz) of coconut milk & thought I'd give this a shot.  This is just gross.  I can't begin to think of what this would taste like with a 14oz can.  HOWEVER ... I made another recipe from this site (Barbecue Beef Cups) and I had extra meat left over so I mixed this rice, with the bbq meat and ended up with a Sloppy Joe alternative.  Thanks for the experiment recipe ... it was a fun try.  :-)

The only reasons I gave this recipe an extra star was because I enjoyed the texture and it was easy to make.  Other than that, I was extremely disappointed with it.  I could not taste the coconut flavor at all, and it was nothing like I had experienced in my favorite caribbean restaurant.

I loved this rice. I love anything coconut. I made it with a recipe I had for pineapple salmon. It was a perfect complement for the hawaiian pineapple and orange flavors. I think it should be served with any fruit based dish but alone it some may find it too bland. I actually have made it a couple of times and I find it goes well with even Teryaki. Defintely try it. Its so easy and delicious and its fun if you are in the mood for something a  little exotic.

I used light coconut milk, and it sure was missing the coconut flavor in the finished rice, as another reviewer noted.  I just couldn't do the regular coconut milk after reading the nutrition label!  ;-)  Maybe next time, I'll just add a bit of shredded coconut as suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made exactly as described, my beautiful Thai prawn curry dinner was ruined.

The rice was at once sloppy AND dry.  I cooked it for the full 18 minutes.  It could have used at LEAST ten to fifteen more minutes

Three things:  It needs more sugar and salt.  The pinch of salt recommended is the cause of the blandness.  Try a tablespoon of sugar and teaspoon of salt.  Also, the rice didn't cook evenly for me.  At the end of the cook time there was liquid on top and the bottom rice was drier and not completely cooked.  I suppose it separated because coconut milk has lots of fat and is therefore lighter than the water.  If I make it again I plan on giving it a stir a few times during the cooking period.
Like others have said, the flavor is subtle but is ok.  I found that eating it (warm) like cereal with milk and a bit of sugar  was much better and seemed to bring out much more of the coconut flavor.

This turned out great, the coconut is very subtle and the creaminess was fantastic.  It was excellent paired with the spicy chicken vindaloo that I made.  The slight sweetness contrasts very nicely with spicy dishes.  As others have mentioned, I added the sugar and the coconut milk into the rice after it had soaked up some of the water so that it wouldn't burn.  The rice cooked for me in about 14 minutes.  I think 20 minutes would cause it to burn.

It was yummy! I followed the exact recipe! Next time I’ll do more coconut milk and less sugar just out of preference! :-)

I made mine with  unsweetened coconut milk  14 oz and added 1/4 cup more water than called for by recipe as that was the amount called for on my Jasmine rice. I put it in a power pressure cooker XL on rice timed at 8 minutes.It came out  Great. This also does nicely with a short grain brown or stir fried the next day with a squeeze of lime.

Added pineapple tidbits and 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice.  This was a big hit.  Had to double the recipe in order to have enough for second and third helpings.

I made as directed, changes  I made were to add a handful of Nature Source Organic Salad topper (it is a mixture of dried cranberries and seeds) that I had on hand and wanted to use since I had a large bag that I had bought at Costco. I added during the last 5 minutes of simmering. 
I  used long grain white rice, since that was what I had on hand,  and simmered in covered pan 15 minutes, and stirred rice halfway through simmer time. Turned off burner, and left lid on 10 minutes. Was creamy, and had a subtle coconut flavor, and the cranberries and nuts added a wonderful dimension to it.

Mixed can of coconut milk and cup and a quarter of water plus salt. Brought to a boil and added rice. Took about 16 minutes to cook. I added green onions and salt once cooked. I was afraid it would be too watery but it thickened fine. A subtle coconut flavor that went perfectly with the Thai pork I put on top of it. Great recipe.

Some members of the family just adored this rice & some just thought it was okay. I really liked it & would recommend it. My son in law on the other hand would have me make it 3 times a week. If you don’t like coconut, it won’t be your cup of tea.

Love this recipe! It is so easy to make and has a subtle coconut flavor that goes well with spicier dishes. I've made it for company several times and almost always get asked for the recipe.

I thought it was pretty greasy. I'm guessing that was the oil in the coconut. Maybe it would have been less greasy if I would have used a "lite" version. I did not have any of the other issues some people had like sticky or uncooked rice. I was also hoping for more of a coconut flavor. Thank you anyway.

I made this in my instapot.  I backed off on the water by 1/4 cup and set it at high pressure for 14 minutes.  Since I've done this recipe twice now I've tried both natural and quick release methods.  Both work although I like the quick release better because I can eat sooner!  :-)  I made this with the baked chicken teriyaki recipe.

Good recipe but calls for WAY too much water, which dilutes the coconut taste, and if only cooked for the specified time, leaves the rice very wet and crunchy. I like rice firm and moist, so I cut the water down to 3/4 c and increased the cooking time to 25 minutes, and now can really taste the coconut and the rice is a nice consistency.

This is the coconut rice Melanie makes. It's FABULOUS and is Max's absolute favorite.  
Great with curried chicken and veggies.  Bake the chicken, saute veggies, add some curry sauce or curry powder.  Good to add a can of diced tomatoes.  Can also add coconut milk, a small can of chicken broth, half and half, cream etc.
Peeled and small diced sweet potatoes are a nice additive to the veggies, as are raisins.

This was amazing!! I noticed a bunch of reviews about the mildness of the flavor, but I thought it was perfect. The coconut flavor *is* mild but you can really taste the richness of the coconut milk, and the light hint of coconut and sugar. I loved it. I could eat this like dessert.

I used calrose rice because I was out of jasmine, but it worked well. I followed the (ridiculously easy) directions exactly and it cooked in 20 minutes.

I followed one of the reviewers' suggestion and used my rice cooker to make this. It came out perfect. I do not like the rice that comes with the main dish being too sweet, so I cut the sugar in half, and for my taste, it was subtle but perfect balance of savory.

Good recipe.   I did make one change and added 5-7 cloves to the pot while i boiled the rice.   I found this added a bit of balance.

I made this alongside the Sweet Teriyaki Beef Skewers from this site,  and all 12 people were extremely impressed! These family members eat rice frequently,  but had never tasted rice like this! Although I am not particularly a rice person,  I ate 2 servings of this amazing,  yet simple,  dish!  The skewers were a sensation as well!

I made it in the rice cooker as another suggested.  It turned out fine.  It is good but don't expect it to be a powerful flavor pop.  It is a subtle coconut flavor in a rich rice dish.

Excellent recipe!  My husband wanted to add coconut flakes, but I was counting Weight Watchers points.  We served this with broiled fish topped with pineapple salsa.  Almost as good as Shaggy’s on the coast!

This recipe was okay... I really liked the texture of the rice, it came out perfectly soft and fluffy.  But it barely tasted like coconut at all.  And when you mix it with a spicy main dish, you really can’t taste anything more than just plain old rice.  My daughter couldn’t taste any coconut at all.  In the future, I will just make regular white rice as the coconut milk adds a lot of extra calories for minimal flavor.

I just made this recipe and my results were EXCELLENT!  I cooked mine in the Instant Pot on the rice setting.  It has a wonderful coconut taste.  Remember, all coconut milk is not th the same.  Find one that s for y’all you.

Loved this rice, the only thing I added was fresh grated ginger and more liquid. Had to cook it about 40 min  but the end results was worth it.

Coconut flavour was very nice but the rice was very sticky (too wet).  We made it in our rice cooker using the quantities shown.  Perhaps in the rice cooker less liquid is needed.  Next time, we'll put the rice in the cooker, add the coconut milk and top up with water to the line shown on the rice cooker.

Nope! Never again! This recipe is disgusting! Being Asian, I love coconut and I love rice but WHY would anyone eat this?! Waste of perfectly good rice and can of coconut milk. Taste was way to bland, you definitely have to add coconut flakes to fix it. Awful recipe.

Yes, the taste is mild, but lovely. The rice came out a bit greasy from the coconut fat, but that's fine when paired with other dishes. The texture is divine. I also serve it with a bit of maple syrup for a quick desert. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe/proportions.

I really love this coconut rice as a side for Asian meat dishes but it was very bland the first time I made it so now I always grate some lime zest into the pot (1-2 teaspoons) and it really enhances the subtle flavor and makes it a much more enjoyable dish

Definitely not quite what I was looking for. The rice seemed a little too sticky for my taste and could have done without the extra sugar. I doubt I'll make this again.

Followed directions as written, my problem was the rice still looked soggy so I cooked it a minute longer, the bottom was starting to burn.  Did not know this, not a rice person.

Made as directed, but eliminated the sugar as I don't really care for sweets. I sprinkled the rice with red pepper flakes when I served it. This recipe turned out exactly as I hoped. the rice was a nice texture and the coconut flavor is mild but you can definitely taste it. I'll be making this again.

I love rice and wouldn't normally use a recipe to make it, but wanted to conquer the twist of Coconut Rice properly. As with others, I also found that I had to work hard to keep my rice from burning/sticking. I'll admit that when I read others' reviews I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, "come on people" but I was quickly put in my place. There is something about the consistency of the coconut milk as opposed to plain water that makes it an entirely different experience! To combat this I committed the cardinal no-no of rice cooking and lifted the lid to stir several times. No harm done in the end. The consistency of the final product was quite thick and pasty, not creamy like I've had in restaurants. The recipe as-is is okay, with a good taste but an unsatisfying texture that I wouldn't want to serve to company. I'll be trying it again with some tweaks.

It was too subtle for me.   I had this in a restaurant once, but it was sweeter and had actual coconut in it which I enjoyed far more.  I'll use this recipe as a base for future experimentation.

THIS RICE IS NOT TOO BAD BUT NOT NEAR ENOUGH COCONUT FLAVOUR ....THE RICE AT THE THAI RESTAURANT I FREQUENT HAS THE ULTIMATE COCONUT RICE WITH FULL ON COCONUT FLAVOUR SO THIS RECIPE DISAPPOINTED ME NEXT TIME I WILL TRY USING COCONUT CREAM AND PERHAPS A FEW DROPS OF EXTRACT.

Put it all in the rice cooker and it came out perfectly.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed in a bit of grated ginger, but it would have been excellent without, too.   We have vacationed in Thailand, and each family member commented that it felt like we were back there.  I realize now that this must have been how they made their rice over there.   The coconut flavor doesn't jump out at you, but it definitely complements the rest of the meal.  I made this last night with the Marinated Pork Tenderloin and the Pineapple Slaw on this site, (and some broccoli for some green), and it was an amazing meal.  This will be my new go-to recipe for rice.  (I've never HAD a recipe for rice before... haha :))

Wonderful, with a hint of sweetness.  Used long grain rice because that's what I had and added 1/2 tsp. salt.  Was concerned about scorching from reading so many reviews but it was not a problem.  Stirred, covered, and reduced to a simmer at almost the lowest setting as soon as I saw the first bubbles of boiling.  Stirred once after 10 minutes of cooking, cooked for 18 minutes, then let stand off heat for 10 minutes.  Yummy!  Will make again.

This was incredible. Just the right amount of sweetness. It made too much rice for just 2 people. I had coconut rice with cinnamon for breakfast for about 4 days. I will try one of the light versions of coconut milk and only use 2 cups rice.

This was really tasty rice, and it went so well with the "Grilled Lime Cilantro Chicken with Sweet Chili Sauce" recipe that I made tonight, also from this site. Would make this again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

For those who experience uncooked rice, make sure you soak the rice in water for at least 30 min before you start cooking it. This will help the rice cook through evenly. And for those who loves rice, electric rice cooker is a gem! I grow up in Malaysia and coconut rice is best accompanied by curry dish (curry chicken or vegetables, etc). My husband is American and he loves this rice! Also the only missing (and secret) ingredient is Pandan leaf, a fragrant leaf that you put in whole, yummy!

I followed the recipe with no changes.  Due to the sugar I whisked the rice until boiling to prevent burning and sticking that some reviews mentioned.  I then lowered the burner as low as it goes and covered it to simmer 18 minutes.  All the water absorbed, no burning.  I then let it sit off the burner ten minutes, fluffed with a fork, and served with my    butternut and eggplant curry.  The rice was fluffy and sticky.  It is mild in flavor which made it the perfect vehicle for a curry dish.  Just what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a strong, standout coconut flavor, this is not for you.

made in the rice cooker - was excellent.  Would be even better with a handful of coconut.   soaked the rice for 20 minutes, rinsed well and then added coconut milk and water to the correct lines in the rice cooker

This is a keeper!  I added some coconut butter to the pot.  After the rice was tender I left it to caramelize and crisp over medium heat for several minutes.

I used long grain rice and it was still really good. I also added shredded coconut which I think totally makes it a lot better since I love coconut and the texture is also really great!

I would put this in notes rather than rating but alas....  Made something similar:  1 cup water, 1 cup jasmine rice, 1/2 cup coconut cream, 3/4 Tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt.  Combine them in a med sauce pain, bring to boil (dissolve sugar), reduce to low, cook x 40-45 mins.  (Fluff with fork, cover, and let sit for 20 minutes - didn't do this).  Awesome with slow-cooker Kalua pork from this site!  The strength of coconut flavor was just right!

Awesome!  I made this in my rice cooker - just dumped in all ingredients - and enjoyed the very best rice in 20 minutes!  I had basmatti rice instead of jasmine, but otherwise didn't change a thing!  Highly recommended!

I made this recipe according to directions, but added a tiny bit of extra sugar and regular shredded coconut.  It is still a little bland, but creamy and has a mild coconut flavor.  I would probably add coconut extract, like another person mentioned for another flavor kick.  Overall, I would make it again.

This rice is really good, a very nice coconut taste. I give it 4 stars because I just feel like it's missing something.. It's not quite the same as the kind from my favorite Thai restaurant. But it is delicious and I will keep making it, maybe one day I'll find that secret ingredient.

I made this recipe with lite coconut milk so maybe that's why it wasn't very good.  It had no coconut taste so my husband had to douse it with soy sauce.  We were both really disappointed.  I won't make this again.  :(

Great recipes! I agree with the reviewer who advised that this is not a stand-alone dish, but one meant to accompany and complement Asian dishes. The coconut flavor was very rich with just the right amount of subtleness.

It was very good.  My entire family requested it again.

I  cooked in my rice cooker and added some unsweetened coconut flakes for texture.  I added the water last, on top of the rice and coconut milk/stuff, like another reviewer suggested.  This was fabulous.

I made it in my rice cooker, stirred it about  every 4-5 minutes to make sure it wasn't sticking to the bottom. Topped with green onion (scallion) slices and chopped cilantro!  Excellent side dish;  add golden raisins , chopped crystallized ginger, and a dollop of whipped topping for a creamy dessert.

My husband and I both love this rice. Keep an eye on it while it's cooking, you want it just barely simmering. I cut back on the sugar just a tiny bit, and stirred in about 1/3 cup shredded, sweetened coconut once it was cooked. I think toasted slivered almonds would be another thing you could add.

I just made this and it was delicious. Used lite coconut milk and added a teaspoon of coconut oil and cooked for 15 minutes. Then sprinkled with toasted coconut.  Served it with spicy baked pork chops and the subtle flavor complimented them perfectly.

This is a wonderful rice recipe to use as a side for an Asian main dish. It had the perfect subtle sweetness. I made this with the same proportions as the recipe called for. However, I used light coconut milk to cut down on calories. I only cooked it for about 12-15 minutes and then took off burner and kept lid on to let steam cook it for another several minutes. I also added a drop of coconut flavoring and about a 1/4 cup of coconut flakes after it was cooked. Served it with grilled Asian style chicken.

I was a little worried that the coconut taste would overwhelm this recipe and my husband would guess the flavoring was coconut.  I made the recipe as written and the result was a very pleasant taste with a light coconut taste.  It paired nicely with 'Mandarin Orange Chicken' from AR, and hubby didn't guess what the flavoring was.

I modified this receipe slightly from what's listed here.  I used sushi rice instead of jasmine rice, and I also used coconut cream instead of coconut milk.  The result was a delish coconut rice that was thick and sticky and had an intense coconut flavor. Toasting some coconut to add to the top would definitely set this version of the receipe off right.  If you choose to use the sushi rice you will need to add a bit more water.  I think in the end I ended up using probably 1-1/2 cups more of water than whats listed above.

Made this in my rice cooker and found it a nice change from making regular white rice.  The coconut milk comes through very little.  Hubby liked it.

The only change I made was using stevia instead of sugar. It came out perfectly and was delicious. Had to keep the old man out of the kitchen to prevent him from scoffing it all up on us :-) I'll definitely be making this again!

This rice recipe was delicious.  I didn't have any Basmati or Jasmine rice, so we just used regular white rice.  Our son thought it tasted like pudding.  We didn't change anything from the recipe.

I made this Asain Rice but instead of coconut milk, I used cream of coconut "Coco Lopez" and I didn't add any sugar because I really didn't think it needed it.  I also used sea salt instead of regular salt as someone suggested.  It came out GREAT.  I will be making this more often.....LOVED IT..........

Nice subtle flavor.  I made this in a rice cooker using roughly the same proportions of water and coconut milk as in the recipe.  In the grips of burnt rice paranoia, I stirred halfway through.  No need.

Delicious!  This is a new family favorite for rice.  I served it with Chef John's Caramel Chicken.  The two served together...heaven on a plate!

Although we like coconut, I was wondering if it would taste too stongly of coconut, but it doesn't.  It has a wonderfully mild, delicious flavor.

Very hard to explain the taste of this rice. It was good and different. It was a little sweet and a little salty but nothing overwhelming. I will be making this rice again and again when we need something different for the week.

Even after all the liquid had been absorbed the rice was undercooked. I added some extra water. The flavor was subtle but excellent. Next time I will reduce the rice to 1c to avoid undercooked rice.

I have made this rice twice.  It seems to have a rich quality to it.  The richness outweighs any new flavor.  So it doesn't really taste the way it sounds.  Once you get past that expectation, it is really fantastic.

The first time, I received comments from my girls that the rice was good.  The second time, the men of the house became passionate about this rice.  I prepared as instructed with no problems.  Served with pan fried chicken thighs and stir fry veggies with soy sauce and garlic.  Beautiful, although the rice seems to have upstaged the rest of the meal.  

Seems like it would be good with a Hawaiian pork dish (my next cooking adventure).

This was amazing...the nicest white rice recipe we have tried. I had to add a little more water after 10 min but I have a new stove & maybe the heat was too high. I stirred in a tbsp of coconut oil just before serving & maybe this enhanced the flavour. I made a  pudding out of the left over rice with some dried mango & raisins & even my husband loved it. He doesn't normally like rice pudding. Thanks for a great recipe

Right before I turned down the heat I got worried because I had to stir it the rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan. I let it cook for about 30 mins and it came out soooo good!! Im eating it plain!! I could probably live off this stuff!! Would be great with a good pineapple chicken though :)

The rice turned out nice and fluffy with a mild coconut taste.  Used brown jasmine rice.  Will definitely make it again!

This is a great tasting dish.  You can really taste the coconut, but it's not overpowering.  I made this with the Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi recipe (also from this site) as another reviewer had done.  I was not able to find a 14oz can of coconut milk, so I used a 13.5 oz can and substituted 1/2 oz of water.  It did not need the 1/2 oz of water.  It did not cook in the 20 minutes. It was more like 25 minutes.  Next time, I won't add the 1/2 oz of water.  I did sprinkle it with fresh cilantro on each plate and it was great.

The coconut flavor is understated, so if you are looking for something strong this is not for you. Otherwise, the recipe is fantastic. Always a hit at dinner and perfect every time, esp when served with salmon.

Used 1 can coconut milk and 3/4 cup water to 1 cup of Jasmine rice, 1/2 tsp salt. No sugar but stirred in 1/4 c sweetened coconut after cooking.  Perfect!  5* for me - 4* for you!

Wonderful!! But like other reviewers said, don't think you can eat this all by itself...The coconut flavor doesn't "pop" until it's eaten with something else. I made this to go with the Seschwan shrimp recipe on this site. Tasted great with that.

this got a big thumbs up from the DH.  I liked it too.  Mild coconut flavor, slightly sweet.  I used lite coconut milk.  I may have put a tad too much sugar in it, i didn't measure, but this was excellent to go with our asian marinaded grilled swordfish.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the post Silvrezs.

This was my first time making a recipe like this and it was fantastic!!!  The only change I made was that I used white basmati rice instead.  My 4yr old who doesn't like plain basmati rice ate her whole plateful. This will become a frequent dish in our house from now on:)

If I was rating this rice alone, I would give it three stars.  It was good, but unlike any rice I have ever had.  I know this sounds weird, but it tasted a little like popcorn.  I followed the directions and it cooked perfectly, which I liked.  I paired this rice with Sweet, Sticky and Spicy Chicken from this site and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was eating truly authentic food.  I will be pairing the rice with the chicken again most definitely!  Although different, this rice is worth a try.

We loved this!! Followed the recipe exactly and everyone went back for seconds. Perfect texture and slightly sweet with mild coconut flavor. I will look for main dishes to serve with This! Thanks for sharing!

Very nice and easy.  Even the kids liked it.  Better than the brown rice I usually serve.  We're having it again tonight.

Delicious!  I had leftover cooked Jasmine rice (about 3 cups or so) and omitted the water.  Comes out as a wonderfully delicate flavor that doesn't overpower the taste of the rice.  This will be perfect under some shrimp scampi. Thanks Silvrezs!

I thought this was great with the curry chicken and steamed peas I made for dinner.  We have never made coconut rice but it was easy and turned out great.  For those reviews that said is was much too sweet or burned, I bet they purchased Cream de Coco instead of coconut milk.  There is a HUGE difference.  The one is full of sugar and used to make Pina Coladas.  Make sure you get plain old coconut milk!!!!  I think this would be fantastic with some fresh chopped cilantro added after it is finished cooking.  Thanks for the recipe.

fail.  I've tried this recipe twice (once on the stovetop and once in a rice cooker) and the rice is always hard as a rock and the coconut milk gelatinous.  Even after cooking for close to an hour...the rice was hard.  End result looks nothing like the photo and it is really sickly sweet.  I wanted this recipe to come out well cause I love the idea of coconut with rice.  Im obviously doing something wrong if everyone is having success.

I will make this again. It's so easy and the texture was perfect, nice and sticky. I used my rice cooker.  It's perfect for spicy dishes. It's not sweet, and that is what is so great about it. I made it with a Thai dish, but it would be great with spicy wings or something of this nature as well. We had dinner guest tonight and this was a hit with kids and adults!

This was OK, pretty boring but I'm trying to think of it as subtle.  Maybe if I had just added a little more salt and sugar the coconut flavor would be stronger.

The recipe may be good but I just learned that I am NOT a fan of coconut rice. Made it with marinated swordfish and steamed veggies. Looked beautiful but apparently I really do hate anything related to coconut. The husband "liked" it but I doubt that I'll be making it again. Sorry! I'll stick with scented jasmine rice. :)

Has a very subtle flavor, but because it is a side dish, I like how light and refreshing the taste is. It made a nice, sticky rice.  If only it had a tad more coconut flavor, then I could give it five stars.  But, still, a good recipe and definetly recomended.

I quite liked this recipe! I did find that I liked about a tablespoon of sugar as opposed to a teaspoon - and 20 minutes was the perfect cooking time. I will definitely make this again.

A very nice and easy side dish. I found it good with lots of toasted coconut on it. My husband loved it with and without the coconut. Will most likely make again.

I made this last night with the E-Z Marinated swordfish, what a great combination - the coconut flavor was great with the lime flavor of the marinade for the swordfish.  The only thing I did differently was that I added about 1/4 cup shredded coconut with all the other ingredients.  I also think that 20 minutes was way too long, since it took so long to come to a boil it was a little mooshy, will cook it less next time.  Will definitely be making again.

This was really good, I served it with the chicken satay from this website. I did toast sweetened coconut in the oven the last 5 minutes and mixed it into the rice when I was done. I used instant rice, cut it out of the bad, and added 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk to the pan...it was done in 10 minutes....wonderful!

I am giving this 4 starts because my son and husband loved it.  I thought it was OKAY. I thought it tasted a but like Oatmeal and I am not a fan of oatmeal.  But when I mixed it with the Chicken and Pineapple from "Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs".  It was really really good.  

So don't serve this alone.  And I added a bit more sugar.

Fantastic! This is an easy recipe that tastes great! I add toasted coconut on top to add a little crunch to the soft rice.

Very Very Good.  The only thing I did different was I used 6 TB Sweetened Condensed Milk instead of the sugar.  I like the extra creaminess and sweetness it gives.

This was the first time I had coconut rice, to be honest I wasn't too keen.  My husband liked it though and I think that going by other people's descriptions it turned out pretty much as it should.  It was just too heavy and sweet for my liking, but I do think that that is really just down to personal taste and not down to the recipe.  Still...it was nice to try something different, so thanks for the recipe nevertheless.

This rice dish was excellent.  The only thing I did different was to add the rice at the same time I combined the other ingrediants and to add a little bit of cilantro before serving. It turned out perfectly and cooked in the required amount of time.  The flavour of the rice was light and the perfect side dish for our somewhat spicy grilled fish.

The rice was okay, but a bit to sweet for me. I cooked it as was instructed, but it was not completely cooked, and so a bit chewy.

Very creamy and did the job.  Used Minute Rice (all we had) and it turned out great.  Just use the same amount of liquid to rice and you will be fine.
Served this with Peanut Beef on this site.

this was good, but i agree with some other members that it needed a tad more flavor. Adding Coconut extract or flakes works well. Best served with a spicy chicken!

Came out perfectly as directed. Loved the subtle flavor and the smell. Used Trader Joe's jasmine rice (rinsed first as directed). Took me about 18 minutes to get it perfectly cooked.

This turned out well because I added a little nore water than the recipe suggests. The coconut flavor is fairly mild but good. Next time, I'll use less rice.

I felt the ratios in this recipe were slightly off.  There was not enough liquid to properly cook the rice--and I cook rice quite frequently!  Moreover, the sweet coconut rice we get from our local Thai restaurant is a bit sweeter and typically complements our spicy asian dishes so well.  This recipe unfortunately misses the mark.

I reduced the recipe to 2 servings to make it for myself for lunch. I added a little more water based on what people said - I don't know, I found it kind of unnecessary. It came out a little mushy but that's just because I added extra liquid. It's a good-tasting alternative to just plain jasmine rice, but I wouldn't make it all the time due to the extra fat&etc it adds. Next time I'm going to use 1/2 the amount of coconut milk to lessen the fat & add a subtle flavour.

Add a couple teaspoons more sugar, a half cup of toasted coconut and a little more on top, and some toasted chopped almonds and this is really good.  Raisins might be nice too.  I made it with light coconut milk and it tasted fine.

I made this as a dessert with fried plantains.  I used the recipe as is except I added an extra teaspoon of sugar. I sauteed the very ripe plantains in brown sugar and butter until they were gooey and heated through and then put them on top of the rice. My boyfriend loved it and ate it right up.

I didnt care much for it, becuase it had such a strong coconut taste. More seasonings would be nice, but my parents loved it!UPDATE: i am going to try making this recipe again with a sweet orange chicken recipe. i think it will be good it the chik goes on top of it and i probably wont add the whole can of coconut milk and double the sugar.

This was very good and very easy to make.  The coconut flavor was not overpowering but it was there - quite nice.  Added another 1 tsp of sugar and also stirred in some coconut flakes when the rice was finished cooking.  Served this with "Thai Pinapple Chicken Curry" also found on this site, and will definitely make it again to serve with other dishes!

I added a little more water and a little less sugar (after reading the reviews) and it came out perfectly.  Nice flavor!

This rice is okay.  It needs something to jazz it up a bit, but I am not sure what.

If this is meant to be a dessert, it is not sweet enough.  If it's meant to be served with a main, it's both too sweet and kinda boring...  The one up side was that the (TONS of) leftovers became the most unbelievable rice pudding. So not a total waste, I suppose...

Loved this recipe, very easy with a mild coconut taste. The only change I made was I added a little more surgar.

Heaven!  I never thought rice could be so delicious! It is so creamy and perfectly balanced but very filling. I served it with a modified pineapple chicken tender recipe from this site. I will be making this again!

My family and I love this rice recipe.  Makes a nice flavorful change from regular rice.  I usually make this recipe with honey sesame chicken or some other asian style meal.

Yummy!  So far I have served this with red chicken curry and baked fish.  It smells so good when it's cooking, and it really compliments a good Thai or other Asian dish.  For you folks who cook on a powerful gas cooktop, be careful of the temperature at which you simmer the rice.  You could end up with some overcooked crispies on the bottom.

Fantastic!  Made this to go with Hawaiian kabobs and it fit perfectly.  I thought it  might be too sweet, but my husband and I both went back for seconds.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe and it was very bland - not worth the extra Fat intake at all!! I added some fresh cilantro & mint on top (as recommended by an identical recipe on diff site), but even then I still had to add lots more sugar & salt before I found it interesting. I did like the *mint* flavor to this. But all in all, not worth the hassle.

This worth every extra calorie. I topped it with Spicy Orange Beef - a recipe on this site. The richness of the rice is great with the spicy stir fry.

This recipe was very yummy.  It was a great accompaniment to a fish with fruit salsa dish.  For the sake of time, I put all the ingredients in my rice cooker, and it cooked faster than plain rice!  I also used lite coconut milk, and the coconut flavor was just right.  My only suggestion would be to add a touch more sugar, if you want your coconut rice sweet.  Will make again!

good but i have some changes.
i used 3 tablespoons of sugar and found it to be much more flavourfull.  i also added a tablespoon of butter. i am going to try sticky rice or short grain rice next time to see if i can get a better consistancy or texture.

I tried this recipe as written using Basmati rice but found after the required time the rice was too firm and there was still liquid in the pot. It needed another ten minutes of top stove cooking. I also found the flavour of coconut lighter than I had expected, perhaps because I served it as a side dish to spicy pork dish entree.  Next time I will use coconut cream and hope this will give me the flavour I'm looking for and to heck with the calories with a recipe as good as coconut rice.
