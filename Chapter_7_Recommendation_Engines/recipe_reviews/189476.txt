The cheese to use is not queso fresco, which does not melt well.  Instead, use a good melting cheese such as queso quesadilla, asedero, or monterey jack.

These were great! I used Monterey Jack for the cheese, and Cajun seasoning instead of fajita seasoning since that was what I had on hand. If crawfish were cheaper in my neck of the woods, I'd make these all the time! Delicious and fast. Thanks for a great recipe!
