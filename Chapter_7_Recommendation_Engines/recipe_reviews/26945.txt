A friend of mine would not share this recipe -- so glad you posted this here. These are easy, tasty and typically the first appetizer to be eaten.  Bake the Wonton wrappers first, then fill with the sausage mixture and reheat.  This will prevent the wrappers from being soggy.

Excellent - delicious, different and a real "statement piece" on your appetizer table.  Best yet, no rocket science involved to make them - no pointers needed, no changes.  So easy you could almost do this with one arm tied behind your back.  One suggestion - once these are baked remove them from the muffin tin, place them on a cookie sheet and put them back in the oven to crisp up the bottoms.

I first made these in 2003 and they've been a staple for my appetizer parties ever since. I use a combination of sweet and hot sausage, which, because it can be hard to break up during cooking, after draining I put in the food processor for a couple pulses. That way it has nice, even texture. I also use a combination of pineapple salsa and sweet hot pepper & onion relish, both of which gave it a hint of sweetness and zing. Between the hot sausage and the relish, it has a real bite. The sour cream cuts that, though. I always use a pastry bag to apply the sour cream; makes it neat, quick and easy. A make-ahead tip is to pre-bake the wonton skins, using a small wooden pastry dowel to press them GENTLY into the tin, sprayed with Pam. Spray the skins lightly prior to baking, and watch them in the oven; they can burn quickly. I then use a small scoop to fill the cups with the sausage mixture that I warmed up separately. This way you can make both days ahead (store the cooled cups in a resealable bag), then assemble just prior to plating. The thing I love about these is the texture...crunchy (from skins above the muffin rim) and chewy (part encasing the sausage).

My husband and I tried these and really liked them.  The only problem I had was that although I drained and rinsed the sausage, the appetizers still tasted a little greasy as they cooled a bit.  I am not really a fan of sausage, anyway, so that could have contributed to my 'picky-ness'.  I think that this is a great idea, and will try other fillings.  Seasoned and grilled chicken would be wonderful.  Beef taco filling would be good.  Or, even doing a crab rangoon filling and topping with sweet and sour might be worth a try.  What about all diced veggies (peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc.) that have been tossed with a little seasoned olive oil and topped with parmesan after baking?  The possibilities are endless.

This is a very simple recipe and very impressive.  I brought a triple batch to a family gathering and went home with none.  I left off the sour cream and green onion and prepared a simple dipping sauce of sour cream and taco seasoning for them instead.  I also used plain ground pork and a very mild salsa which made them very kid friendly.  The second batch I made with Seasoned pork and hotter salsa.  Next time I will go back to the plain ground pork and rely on the salsa for the seasoning.  MAKE THESE!  You will receive lots of praise!

I love this recipe; try brushing the wonton 'cups' with oil, especially on the tips, prior to baking for 5 min.   before filling with sausage mixture.  Return to oven to bake an additional 5 min.

All in all the recipe was okay, but I would probably try ground beef next time.

The Bunco ladies enjoyed these last night!  I did pre-bake the wonton wrappers for about 8 minutes earlier in the day to make prep time easier.  Also took the advice of another reviewer and pulsed the sausage in my food processor a couple of times, just to get an even crumble.  I also mixed the sausage, salsa & cheese earlier in the day - then just popped it in the micro for a couple of minutes, filled the shells and re-heated for about 6 minutes, just to re-warm the shells.  I got 34 out of this recipe instead of 24 - just a heads up for others.  Nice appetizer, and will make again.  Thanks.

These are quick and easy appetizers!!!
The only thing I noticed was that they were a little salty... 
And if you are in a rush, the pre-made phyllo dough cups in the frozen food section at the supermarket prove to be a cinch!!!

Simple and easy.  I love recipes that look like I slaved for hours.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I made them for a Christmas Eve buffet and made them the night before.  They are delicious.  I will definatley make these again.

This recipe was great!  I made it for a SB party.  I made a double batch and it was still the first thing gone.  Everyone wanted the recipe. I used hot salsa and the italian sausage and it wasn't bland at all.  I did put the sour cream and green onions on the side.  I will use this recipe a lot.

I was told about Sausage Flowers from a co-worker and promptly found the recipe here.  It is a favorite at any gathering and I never have left-overs.  A couple of things that I wanted to pass on are:  (1) You can substitute Hot Sausage for Italian for more kick and use a mexican blend of shredded cheese.   (2) The meat, cheese, and salsa mixture can be made in advance.  You can take it to the party and just reheat in the microwave (to warm it) then put it in the wonton wraps and bake.   (3)  I have also made them 100% in advance, baked them for 5 minutes, then finished them for 5 at the party.    Super easy, super delicious, and a crowd pleaser!

I hope its okay to review these even though I didn't alter the recipe or use substitutions of any kind. Made these for a party of 14 and they were a step above your run-of-the-mill baked appetizer. They went over quite well with my guests. They were likened to "taco sliders", and that's a pretty good description. Using Italian sausage instead of a ground beef/chorizo taco meat added a little unexpected flavor layer. Be sure to drain the sausage really well after frying it up, or you'll end up with soggy bottoms - and nobody likes soggy bottoms!. I didn't have that problem, but next time might use a little extra fine-grated cheese in the bottom to as additional insurance before loading in the meat mixture. I can see some other ways to use these, such as pulled pork with cole slaw on top, chopped shrimp with a cocktail sauce on top, etc. Thanks, TeresaFL for this fun recipe!

I call these sausage cups and prebake the wrappers until the tops are browned.  Great for a party because you can do all of the work beforehand and throw together once company is over.  I also add some chopped onion and bell pepper, I saute it in the same pound as the hot sausage.  Real crowd-pleaser!

Extraordinarily easy recipe--especially for a non-cook like myself--very nice presentation and greatly enjoyed.  One caveat, though, it took longer than 25 minutes for prep--I'd allow at least 45 minutes.

I made several modifications to this recipe. First I diced up a small onion and sauted it with the meat and 3 cloves of garlic. When it was almost done I added a 1/2 cup of diced celery and a 1/2 cup of diced crimini mushrooms.  To the cheese mixture I added about 1/4 cup of parm.
Instead of putting the wontons in a muffin cup I filled them and folded them into triangles and baked them on a cookie sheet. I put a little egg wash on top to make them brown up and get nice and crispy. 
They were a hit at the party!

Perfect as is, and deceptively simple. They look so pretty, you don't even want to eat them! 

Note: you don't need a mini muffin tin. I had a regular muffin tin, and it came out fine. I imagine the mini muffin tin just might make them look different.

I liked the idea for this recipe. The wonton wrappers were not the best to use. I almost wished I could fry them and then fill them but baking them wasn't good. The filling is great we just used it as a dip for chips.

These were just OK - not bad, not awesome.  I did pre-bake the wonton shells so they'd stay crunchy and that really helped; I recommend doing that if you make this.

These are great and very easy!  I also made the filling ahead of time and put them in the just as my guests were arriving.  I did have to up the temp and bake them longer than 10 minutes.  Next time I will try to bake the wonton wrappers before putting the filling in.  The biggest change I made was using pork chorizo instead of sausage.  This was delicious!!  Just be sure to get rid of all of the grease from the chorizo otherwise it will get soggy.  I drained the grease and left the meat sitting on paper towels for a while.  Now I just wish I had more chorizo to use up the rest of the wonton wrappers.

I make something similar except that  instead of salsa and sour cream add a cup of ranch and some(3-4) finely chopped green olives. A totally different taste but a good one at that.   I  get a lot of requests for the recipe.

These are fantastic and so, so easy! My husband loved them- in fact, there were only three of us the first time I made them and the two boys ate them all! Then I took them to a tailgate and they were the first thing to run out- I should have doubled or tripled. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made these multiple times and LOVE them!  I typically try to make it a bit healthier by using ground turkey with some italian seasoning and ground red pepper for flavor. I will also sometimes add light ranch dressing into the mixture as well.  They've proven to be quite popular!

I got lots of great compliments when I served these appetizers. I made the filling early in the day and refrigerated it and then filled and cooked the wonton skins at the last minute. Not really a lot of effort at all when it's done that way. I used 2 cups of cheese total rather than only 1. Using a 1" cookie scoop to fill the cups (the kind that looks like a mini ice cream scoop) I got 3 dozen appetizers rather than 2.

I made these for New Years; it made a TON of them and there was really no good way to keep them warm for the length of the party.  We used a sterno steam tray (with heated water under food pan to keep it warm) but I found that the flowers got pretty soggy.  I think that I would halve the recipe next time and perhaps change it to a taco concept using ground beef, taco seasoning and much of the same other ingredients as listed here for the sausage flowers.

Winning appetizer served at our Superbowl party.  We sealed and twisted the tops of the wrappers for less mess as a finger food.  Also made some with only cream cheese and salsa mixture that were very tasty.  Did not use toppings.

All three of my teens raved about these, they disappeared quick! I used turkey sausage, and prebaked the wontons in a regular sized muffin pan for 5 minutes, and had absolutely no issue with soggy bottoms.  The bottoms were nice and crispy.  Kids preferred them without the sour cream and just the green onion.  These will be added to my appetizer rotation!

These are awesome! Hard to eat just one, or five....  I also have a similar recipe that was with a sausage coupon (don't remember what brand) and it was the cooked sausage, the cheese and ranch salad dressing. Doesn't sound like a good combination but it really is! And yes, bake the wontons in the oven first, empty, for about 5 mins and then fill and finish baking! Great recipe these Sausage Flowers, thanks!

ok.... fresh out of the oven these were great. a little labor intensive but very flavorful. However they were not good after they cooled some because they got VERY soggy. I really liked the flavor and idea but think i will put them in tostitos scoops next time so there won't be a soggy issue when they are cold. iv baked alot of things in scoops and they never get soggy! thanks for the method!!!

This is a welcome mat for immature taste buds. I used Phyllo Dough instead of wonton wrappers. Make sure that you make the ramekins first then that way your flowers will actually look like flowers without burning them. It saves time and all you have to do is add the sausage mixture. This recipe is demanding meaning that your friends and family will want more.

I used filo cups, which made this super easy.  The filling is absolutely delicious; you could eat it on it's own.  I had some leftover and used it as filling for omelets--it was great.  This is a great recipe to make ahead and freeze also; will make again.

Yay these are so good! I made three dozen lil flower cups the day before my party, gently browned then tipped all of them over and put on a large jelly roll pan to brown/crisp the bottoms a bit. Next morning made the filling (used mild Italian sausage and only half cup of green salsa), great stuff and so easy. For fun I put the sour cream in my frosting squeezie to make cuter dollops, then topped with the chives that are flourishing in the garden. Filled and reheated those babies, then (took a picture) and served them up...had no leftovers! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good recipe and easy to change for your personal tastes. Main problem is that stars get soggy and a little weird underneath. To resolve this issue, toast the wrappers in the muffin tin for 5 minutes before filling is added to help the bottom of each star crisp up. Once you've added filling cook for additional 8-12 minutes...or until filling is warm, corners of stars are crispy and cheese is melted.

Filling is great, and the wonton wrappers LOOK pretty, but mine came out chewy, and didn't add anything to the flavor presentation.  I'll try again, but will probably use crescent dough pressed into the muffin cups, or the pre-made phyllo cups.

I made these for our SB party.  Didn't have wonton wrappers, so I used some phyllo dough and made the squares only 2".  Added an extra 1/2c of MJ cheese, and cooked them at 400 degrees.  The buttery taste of the phyllo didn't interfere with the sausage mix.  I will make this again, next time adding a few more ingredients and spices.

THis was a little disappointing.  Even with the sausage it was little bland, and the wonton wrappers were a little soggy.  I liked the idea, though, and they looked pretty.  I will try it again sometime, but will use ground beef and kick it up with more of a queso cheese sauce.  Maybe precook the wontons a little to crisp them up a bit.

Easy. Tasty. Great for social gatherings! I suggest using a pastry bag for the sour cream and don't use as much as indicated.  Good as is, but flexible enough to adjust to your liking.

Made these for a party and they got a lot of compliments.  Followed the helpful advice of several past reviewers and baked the wonton wrappers for about 6 minutes before adding the filling and putting back in the oven to finish baking.

These were pretty good and were very easy to prepare.  I added black olives and black bean and corn salsa.  As suggested by other reviewers I used phyllo cups.  My guests seemed to enjoy these  but obviously preferred other appetizers more. Thanks.

Great idea I used for the base of a Mexican appetizer.  Combined cooked beef chorizo, can corn, can olives, and can pinquito beans for filling and topped with crumbled queso fresco.  I served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce!  Everyone at the party was impressed and gobbled them up.

I should have used phyllo cups because the won-ton wrappers came out wierd.  The filling had a nice flavor but the won ton wrappers tasted like they needed to be fried not baked.  They ended up to have a hard crunch and the flavor took away from the filling flavor.

so easy and so yummy!  you should have seen these dissappear at a holiday event!   Although I couldn't find wonton wrappers so I used tiny prepared pastry shells instead.  I also used smoked chipolte salsa.  I've already made this a few times and will keep making it!   Thanks!

These are very tasty.  The first time I made them was last New Year's Eve and they have become a frequent  request from my family and friends.  Pre-baking the wonton for a few minutes does help to keep them from getting soggy especially when you make them in advance of when you are going to bake them.  Be sure to serve 'em hot.

Great recipe!  I mixed up the sausage mixture the day before I wanted to serve them and then stuffed premade phyllo cups with it the morning of my party.  I mixed the sour cream and green onions together and served it on the side.  It was a wonderful topping since I used very hot sausage and extra cheese. Stuffing mushrooms with the sausage mixture would make a great low carb appetizer.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  I think everyone left with the recipe.  The second time I made them ahead of time, but they are not good reheated.  We used spicy sausage for a little kick.  Very Good.

Very easy.  Gave me ideas for trying other fillings in wontons such as greek sausage with cucumber ranch dressing or cooked apple and spices for a dessert.

I tried this for a Christmas party. I took 48 and within 1/2 hour they were all gone! I followed the recipe with one exception I baked the wonton's in the oven first,  and then scooped the mixture in afterwards. This prevented the bottom of the shell from getting soggy. Everyone loved them!!

I make this all the time and people love it.  For best results, I use the sausage you buy in a roll in the freezer section of supermarket. It breaks into smaller pieces upon cooking easily.  Also, it is easy to fill the wonton wrappers if you take a teaspoon full of filling and push it into the flat wrapper while it is laying flat ontop of the mini muffin tin.

This was a huge hit at our Christmas open house!  These flew off the trays--even the kids loved them.  I used the pre-made phyllo cups because my grocery did not have wonton wrappers--only egg roll wraps.  These snacks turned out wonderfully!!

These were pretty good but I made some changes as I was working from memory without the recipe.  I chopped up some onions and cooked with the sausage mix.  Added some green capscicum, black olives,salsa  a small amount of cheese and a few squirts of tabasco.  Cooked the wonton wrappers first as suggested then filled and recooked. They were a bit oily but stil nice. Will make again

These are so easy to make and delicious!  I added a bit of ranch dressing to the mixture and it was wonderful.  I also pre-baked the wonton wrappers until just very lightly golden and they were not greasy at all.  My 16-year old daughter made them as a Thanksgiving appetizer last year and everyone loved them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Awesome recipe. My grocery store didn't have wonton wrappers, so I used fillo pastry dough, which comes in thin sheets, in the frozen food isle. I cut the sheets in squares and put a few layers in each cup. It worked well, and added about 10min to the cook time. I made a whole dozen of these and my husband ate most of them. Definitely making these next time people come over!

Made it according to the recipe and it was a BIG HIT at Thanksgiving! We have a very finicky family, but they loved these. The only thing is i like it a little warmer so i will use hot Italian sausage other wise i would not change a thing .

I made the mixture the night before, and put it in the wonton wrappers right before I served them.  They were a huge hit.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I've made them twice in one week for different occasions.

Excellent!  Easy, yummy and a sure crowd pleaser!  I use extra sharp white cheddar because that is what I had.  This is a keeper!  Very eye appealing for those whose focus on that sort of thing.  Me, it is all about the flavour!

Everyone loved it! I got requests to make them for the next party. The filling was easy to make. However, working with the phyllo dough for the first time, proved to be a challenge.  My store did not have wonton wrappers. I ordered phyllo dough. We followed directions for the dough.  After thawing according to packaged directions, we put a layer of plastic wrap covered with a damp paper towel to prevent the dough from drying out. We carefully took two sheets of dough and cut it into pieces (about  3 1/2 x 3 1/2) to put into the greased mini muffin tins. It turned out great. You don't have to cut it perfectly to any size, because you can't tell once it is in the tin. Great recipe!

We had a party and someone brought these. They were so tasty and addicting. She did not put the sour cream on, we left that to the side for whoever wanted it. They really don't need the sour cream. I thought salsa and Italian sausage was an odd mix, but it really was so good, unbelievably so.

These are AMAZING and so easy to make - seriously, kudos to the creator! Only change I made was to take several reviewers' recommendation and bake the wontons for 5 min. beforehand, then fill them and pop them back in for 5 more minutes. Delicious!

Have made these in the past but couldn't find my recipe. I use turkey sausage instead of beef and mix with mild Italian sausage but follow the recipe as is. These never last long, and everyone always asks for more!

I made these as appetizers for a party I was hosting, and they were an instant hit! I'm definitely going to make them again for an upcoming party. I followed the recipe, and had no issues. Very easy, and tasty!

I made this dish several times, but mixed it up with different fillings. It's important to precook the Wonton wrappers for 5-6 minutes. I put them into a mini muffin tin and prep them for the stuffing. Bake them and then fill with stuffin and put back into the oven until the cheese melts and wrappers are slightly browned.

I followed the recipe as published and then based on a comment transferred them to a cookie sheet to crisp the bottoms.  That's a must.  I now have a new favorite to add to my collection.  A keeper!

These were wonderful.  I used hot italian sausage and  added some hot chilli paste since it suited the crowd I was feeding.  I also added 1/2 chopped onion.  It was a big hit.  So easy to make too.  I was able to make about 36 of these little treasures which was a great surprise.  Cooking time was perfect.  Thank you!

Was looking for something different to make for an appetizer and this was perfect.  Easy to make and looked impressive on the serving table.  Next time might even add a jalapeño on top for a little extra kick.

I made these for the first time last night! I thought they were kind of hard. Everyone said they are so easy. My wontons wouldn't stand up straight. The salsa made the filling runny. I baked them first for a bit, then filled them and baked them again for 10 minutes. They turned out good, especially with the sour cream and chives!

Made these in mini muffin tins because I was afraid the wontons would come apart. They did well and were pretty good. Drain the sausage really well so they aren't too greasy. Serve the sour cream on the side.

I have made this twice so far, once for family, once for a girls' night.  It disappeared with great reviews both time.  It's a great recipe because you don't have to be precise with any of the ingredients.  A change in sausage or type of salsa can make nice variations.  I thought it was great with Jimmie Dean Sage Sausage.

This was good, but didn't wow me.  I subbed ground beef for the sausage (personal preference) and although I pre-baked my wrappers I still had an issue with the bottoms not being crisp.  I also had to bake mine much longer in order for the wrappers to brown.  I felt the sour cream and green onion were a must.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, TERESAFL!
