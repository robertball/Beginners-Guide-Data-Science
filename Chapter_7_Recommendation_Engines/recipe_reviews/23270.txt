I haven't made this yet, but I'm planning on it. 
Just wanted to comment that a good way to avoid choking is to crush the candy cane(s) before adding to the blender. Kinda thought that would be common sense, especially with young kids consumming... But ok...

This thing was the worst!  Never eat it it's horrible.  Chunks of candy cane might choke your 3-year-old too.  Watch out!

My blender wouldn't do much to a candy cane, so I tossed them into my magic bullet instead which gave us a candy cane powder.  I didn't measure, just tossed things in, but I know we used more than one candy cane.  I also dipped the rims of the glasses into the candy cane first which made the drinks look special.  Thanks for the great idea, my kids loved it!

This was SO GOOD!  I doubled the recipe and used 4 thin candy canes.  There are different sized candy canes, so I'd probably add 1 or 2 more because I really like minty, but it was good just as it was.  My 3 year old and 16 month old slurped theirs down like no tomorrow.  For the person who complained about it not staying cool for 10 minutes, our drinks barely lasted 5 minutes, so I wouldn't know.  My 16 month old, literally just kept sucking it down until it was gone and I gave him about 6 oz.  I also had no problems with candy cane pieces.  I blended the milk and candy canes first and then put the ice cream on top so the candy canes were forced to be totally crushed.  No one found a piece larger than a poppy seed.

This would not have tasted good at ALL if i had not added tremendously to this recipe. Turned out that i ended up adding a dash of vanilla, more peppermint, and chocolate syrup just to give it more taste chocolate-wise. Plus ice becuase without ice this drink only stayed a cooler for about ten min. I could've made a better recipe then this one anytime.

Really good. I used about 6 or 7 peppermint discs since this isn't Christmas time. I did however use to much milk. The recipe looks like it says 1 1/2 cups of milk when I think its supposed to say 1) 1/2 cup of milk.
