EXCELLENT! easy, quick and very flavorful. I followed advice of others and cut down on the butter and I used a flavored olive oil (basil); I used more wine (maybe a 1/3-1/2 cup) and the red pepper flakes really sealed it. Will definitely cook this again.

Incredible! I added mushrooms as was suggested in some of the other reviews and I waited until the end to add the clams and simmered them for just about 1-2 minutes, I didn't want chewy clams.

This recipe was soooo YUMMY! I confess to not being the best cook, but this dinner was the best clam sauce I had ever tasted!  I reduced the unsalted butter to 1/3 cup, added 2.5 cans of clam juice (out of the 4 cans of clams) instead of the requested 2 cans of juice, used marsala wine instead of the requested dry white wine, put in about 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper, put in a little extra garlic (I was using "ready to use" minced garlic)and used small shell pasta (all we had left) instead if linguine.  I simmered the sauce on medium electric heat until the sauce was about 1/3-1/4 left, making it a nice consistency (about 20 minutes).  I also served the dinner tossed in decorative bowls instead of plates to allow the sauce to soak into the shell pasta while eating.  This dinner will be repeated in the near future! Hope these suggestions help!

I have made this recipe several times and it's one of our favorites! Here's my changes: chopped clams instead of minced (2 cans), 1/4 cup butter, no additional salt and a sprikle of parsley on top when served. Delicious!

This sauce is almost as good as restaraunt sauce. I found it is best to increase the wine and garlic and decrease the butter.  I also added fresh basil--that really jazzed it up.

I come from a long line of Italians and they all claim to have the "best" clam sauce ever, but puts theirs to shame!!  I make this a lot for company and they all go crazy over it!  The great thing about it is it's soooooo simple to make; a novice could make it and look like a pro.

I felt that this was not what I would consider restaurant quality.  The flavor was ok, a little on the bland side.  White clam sauce is one of my favorite dishes, but something was missing from this recipe.  If I decide to give it another try, I would definately add fresh basil, parsley and some dried red pepper flakes to spice up the flavor a bit.

This lives up to its name!! I did modify it only slightly. I used whole baby clams which I added in for the last 4 minutes of cooking, they will be extremely tough after id you cook them the whole 20 minutes. I did drain half the juice as directed & ended up grabbing a bottle of clam juice & using half of it, next time I simply will reserve all the liquid. I didnt have white wine, so I used cooking sherry. Red wine vinegar will also work just as well for an emergency white wine substitution. Finally I used thin linguine & topped with asiago (which is a much better choice than parmesan for a dish like this). This was outstanding a new family favorite!

This really was the best clam sauce I ever had, even better than what I would get from the expensive seafood restaurant thats in my town! All I added was some fresh Parsley and a pinch of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and used 2 cans of chopped clams. Another great addition is Scott Ures Clams and Garlic with it (I also added the juice from that into the sauce). My husband who cant stand Linguini ate practically the whole pot!

I would have rated this a 5 but with my modifications I couldnt. I added a splash of half n half, a splash of chicken broth and extra wine. Also crumbled a few strips of bacon......yummy!

I was in the mood for linguine and clam sauce and thought I'd look for something different from what I usually make, this looked interesting until it said to cook the canned clams for 20 minutes. Of course I would have to make a change add the clams at the last minute only to heat through. Considering most canned clams are already rubbery the 20 minute cooking time would turn them totally inedible.  Best clam sauce recipe is from Marcella Hazen in her "Essentials of Italian Cooking" which is the one I typically make, you can't possibly go wrong unless you make changes to the ingredients.

I make this quite often.  I use all the liquid and also add some mushrooms, some red pepper flakes and I tend to go a little heavy on the pepper.  I add the clams near the end just to warm them up otherwise they tend to get a little to rubbery for my taste. Also add a handful of fresh parsley at the end.

Just a few things I'd change after I made this the first time...I'd add a palm full of pepperocino (crushed red pepper flakes), wich would of been sauteed briefly in the olive oil with the garlic until fragrant, then ad the onions. I'd also of prefered fresh clams, the canned clams tend to leave a lot desired for me. You can taste the difference...I'd also of swapped out 1/2 cup of butter for 1/2 cup of rosemary infused olive oil, or maybe garlic infused olive oil. The butter really wrecked my cholesterol intake for the day, but I've been good and deserved a dish to spoil myself with. To me this was just your run of the mill resturaunt style white clam sauce, though instead of dry white wine, I liked it better with a good sparkling wine in the sauce the second time around, I used a Prosecco, a sparkling, fruity white wine made in the Tre Venezie region of northeastern Italy. They are relatively cheap wines starting off at 10 dollars a bottle, though the bottle I used was Ruggeri Prosecco Cartizze at about $32. It was a vast improvement over dry white wine.

I am giving this 4 stars because I changed the recipe- a lot and it turned out excellent.  I used 2 cans of clam & their juice (can't imagine clam sauce without the juice!) and then halved the rest of the ingredients.  I added parsley and marjoram (flakes, not ground). I also served with thin spaghetti instead of linguini.  It was excellent.

a great base that lends itself well to improvising. i threw in some dried basil, some fresh spicy oregano and finely chopped kale from the window box. a cooking tip that worked out great: as the sauce is reducing, toss in the al dente pasta and let it cook down together. it will soak up a lot of the liquid and get an incredibly buttery texture.

This was a great foundation!  I, too, played with quantities and ingredients quite a bit.  I reduced the recipe to half, used a lot more white wine, and added some fresh chopped parsley, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes to the mix.  Didn't stir the clams in til the end because I didn't want them to be too chewy.  A definite hit, and I will definitely make again!  Thank you so much!

My All-Time Favorite White Clam Sauce recipe!... I didn't alter the recipe at all.  I made it for family and friends, and EVERYONE was raving about it.  My friend used to think her husbands clam sauce was the best, until she had this one!... Yummm!

This recipe represents the basic framework for an exemplary linguine and clams with garlic white wine sauce. For enhancement, simply saute the onions and 6 cloves of garlic (or to taste) in 3 tablespoons of olive oil and then add the entire contents of 4(6.5 ounce) cans of chopped clams, including the juice to your skillet. Also add an additional 2 tablespoons of olive to the skillet. Do not add butter.
Then add one cup of white wine (or more) and two to three tablespoons of Italian seasoning. Simmer for twenty minutes or until the sauce is reduced and the seasonings have flavored the sauce.
While the sauce is simmering, steam a couple of broccoli crowns till tender. Also dice two large fresh tomatoes. Chop one quarter cup fresh parsley.
Add the broccoli and parsley to the sauce during the last three minutes of cooking the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the linguine and add the chopped fresh tomatoes. As an option, sprinkle some red pepper flakes and/or grated cheese.

This was a quick & easy recipe that I thoroughly enjoyed.  My husband is not a fan, but I'll keep it anyway - he can eat peanut butter!  lol  I think the next time I make it, I'll add more garlic.  Good stuff!

This was great!  All 3 of my kids (5, 6, & 18 mos) and my husband loved this.  It is very rare that I find a recipe that everyone loves. I used 10 oz of fresh pasta, 2 cans of clams and added mushrooms. I kept everything else the same.

Extremely rich taste and "very" filling.  Undoubtedly, the predominance of butter is the reason.  Although I personally have no issues with butter and I enjoyed the results greatly, I would like to try this recipe substituting more olive oil for butter with a lighter taste as an objective.  Although I enjoyed it, others seemed to have a limited appetite for its extreme flavor richness.

Fantastic Recipe. Fantastic Clam Sauce. I added 3/4 stick of butter and 5 tbs of white wine rather than what the recipe calls for. I also added 2 tbs fresh italian parsley =)

This truly is THE BEST clam sauce.  Easy to make and delicious.  I used half chopped razor clams and half canned clams because that's what I had.  We loved it and I'll definitely make it again!

This was really excellent.  I made it for a dinner guest and got rave reviews!!  The only thing I added was some crushed red pepper and a splash of heavy cream.  I'm sure it's equally good without these things but my husband insisted.  I will certainly be making this again and I'm sure it will be requested.  I served this with the white wine I used in the recipe, some garlic bread, and parmesan baked tomatoes instead of a standard salad.  Excellent!

the basic recipe is good, but if you love whits clam sauce, quit messing around with minced clams.   Try baby whole clams in the can and wow everyone with a few clams in the shell on top.  Just add the clams in the shell to the sauce @ 3-4 min until the shells open( do covered). I also add crushed red pepper to the oil for @ 1 min while the garlic is cooking Yummo !!!!

WOW WOW WOW... I couldn't stop eating this!! soooo good! I followed a few previous suggestions and added two handfulls of sliced mushrooms - cooked them with the onions and garlic, decreased the butter to 1/3 cup, used 4tbs of vermouth instead of white wine and topped the finish product off with freshly chopped basil and tomatoes - DELICIOUS!!!!!

This recipe is pretty good, but not great.  I think it needed a lot more wine for more flavor.  Half the butter and lots of fresh chopped parsley would make it a lot better.  Next time I'll try a different recipe.

This clam sauce was delicious but way too much butter.I cut it back to 4 T. and it was great. I also reduced the sauce a bit more, added fresh, well- scrubbed little neck clams to the pan and cooked the mixture with the lid on until they steamed open.Doing this requires less salt as the fresh clam juice has enough salt. A tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley and it's an impressive serve over linguini.

My wife and I are totally addicted to this wonderful recipe.  We originally made it with whole clams and thought it was just ok, but later made it with chopped, and.....wow!  We've had it 3 times a week for the past month.  Good work!

My husband and I both agree that the favor of the sauce is very good, it is more runny than we would like. I'm going to try to thicken it next time.

Excellent recipe - I'm a big fan of white clam sauce and this one is a keeper. I just prepared it using only olive oil (no butter, to keep the fats under control). Easy and delicious! thanks for sharing.

Yummy!!!  I used just 3 cans of clams and 1/4 c. butter then reduced all of the liquid from the clams.  I added the clams just prior to serving as I was concerned about them becoming too chewy.  Also added some red pepper during the onion cooking time.  Easy and delicious!!

Just ok, definitely not the best.  I doctored it up to my taste.  I like more clam juice DO NOT strain any  fabulous clam liquor, I like chopped clams verses minced in my clam sauce.  I suggest cutting back on the butter and add more wine, red pepper flakes and parsley + top w/Parmesan.

You are so right that this is 'the' best clam sauce.  I hadn't planned on making this for dinner so I didn't have all of the ingredients and it still turned out AWESOME!!  Instead of white wine, I used sherry and in place of onions, I used shallots.  Thanks so much for sharing Jodie B.  I already forwarded this recipe to my sister.

Simple, simple, simple and so good! You can thicken it up a bit with flour or cornstarch, but it doesn't really need it. Grate some fresh parmesan over the top and you're good to go. This is an easy dinner and always a winner.

This was great and so easy to make! I did cut the clams down to 2 cans and everyone thought it was perfect, but it would probably be just as great with 4 cans for the real clam lovers!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make this again and again.

It was wonderful. Everybody loved it exept for my 11 year old brother, he had spent about 10 minutes just trying to pick out clams. I didn't know he "tried it before and don't like them" (you know what they mean by that, I'm sure). Great recepie. Thanks a lot. Next time I'll double the recepie, the kind of eaters we are it just wasn't enough.

What a GREAT recipe!!!!  This was fantastic and easy. I added an extra clove of garlic, an extra tablespoon of olive oil and two extra tablespoons of white wine and I added 1 teaspoon of parsley flakes and it was wonderful. My kids even loved it. Absolutely no fish taste at all. Thanks so much!!!!

When one cooks clams for this long they are like little bits of rubber.  Not cool
Make the sauce, less the clams and drop them in on the way to the table

I gave this 5 stars with my slight changes.  I used 2 cans chopped and 2 cans minced clams.  It gives a little more "tooth" to the sauce.  I added about 1/2 cup of wine to the sauce and cooked it down.  Before serving I added the pasta to the sauce .toss and add 1/4 C parmesan cheese.  Rough chop some fresh parsley and add.  Terrific

Fantastic! I only used 3 cans of clams which worked out just fine. I also did not add the clams to the sauce until I had about 8 minutes left. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly - oh and I added some parsley at the end. With garlic bread & a salad - this was a fabulous Sunday dinner! Really loved it!

Wonderful!  Husband really loved it too.  My picky 4 year old said "yum!"  I used 6 big cloves of garlic and should've used more but it was still delicious.  Only used about 1/4 cup of butter, added a can of mushrooms after sauteing the onions, added red pepper flakes and a little more clam juice.  Used half minced and half chopped clams.

This sauce was easy and tasty. I'm not a huge fan of white clam sauce, but this was really good. If I make white clam sauce again, I will use this recipe.

This basic recipe is VERY GOOD.  As many other have noted, it is a great and very safe place to begin. My modifications include: Using at least 50% Boiled Baby Clams as opposed to the minced or chopped clams.  Fresh is perfectly OK too. I hold the clam 'meat' until near the end as it can become tough if cooked beyond warming. Many folks suggests some pepper flakes and I too use them, but this is a very personal thing! As a whole, the basic recipe needs more FLAVOR so I often add SMALL AMOUNTS of an herb or two - do not over do it!  THis is CLAM SAUSE not (whatever herb). Reducing the butter is OK but some volume adjustment is necessary, just to have enough sauce.  More wine, with reduction is one optioin.  For those who won't use wine a little chicen broth is OK - if necessary. I generally use more garlic but that too is a persoinal taste thing. Reducing the sauce from "Broth+With" to a real "Sauce" is probably the most important part.  If it is not reduced to a thicker state, it will not stick to the pasta - which is why we have Sauce in the first place.  A great starter recipe and similar to my basic - for years. Thanks to the young woman (and her Mom) for sharing this.

This recipe was a great starting point. I added some white pepper, red pepper flakes, and some oregano and basil. I also cut down on the butter as others suggested. But, make sure you make less noodles if you cut down on the butter brecause you'll have less sauce. I used little neck clams instead of canned ones and they tasted amazing when I let them steam in the sauce. This recipe is super easy and tastes good!

I enjoyed this and it is a great quick meal.  I used three cans of clams (were on sale 3 for $5).  Also added half an onion, chopped, some Old Bay, and some red pepper flakes.  I will make this again for sure.

This was my first time making a clam sauce and my guy and I who are small eaters ate close to all of it!  Really good!  I used chopped clams instead of minced, I added 6-8 quartered mushrooms and didn't add the clams or mushrooms until the last few minutes.  And of course lots of red pepper flakes :)

Delicious!!  I tossed the liguini and sauce together in the large skillet under low heat before serving so the sauce soaked into the pasta. I topped it with fresh parsley and lemon juice, will definately make again soon!

Awesome....I added mushrooms and black olives, along with the crushed pepper flakes and parsley like others. Added the clams about 5 minutes before serving. I tossed the liguini with the sauce for a few mintues. Will definitely make again.

I couldn't believe I had cooked something this good this easily! Based on other reviews here, and my own tastes, I did tweak the recipe: cutting the butter back to 1/4 cup, using three cans of clams plus one small can of button mushrooms, increasing the wine to 1/4 cup, and adding a pinch of red pepper flakes plus a tablespoon each chopped parsley and basil from my garden, which made it a little prettier as well as jazzing up the flavor. I appreciate this recipe so much for setting me on the track to some truly delicious pasta!

Like others have mentioned, this is a good quick, always-on-hand meal.  I use less oil, all the clam juice and add a little of the pasta water to thicken, let that reduce and then add the clams to just heat through. This was the first recipe I ever used for clam sauce and after tweaking to our tastes, the last! Thanks for posting.

It definately was not "the Best"... probably because it didn't turned out the way I thought it would. My bf liked it though, but I think I'll try another recipe first before using this one again

I had never made a clam sauce before.  As a matter of fact I don't think I've even tried one before.  I like clams and the recipe was very simple however I wasn't really thrilled with the outcome.  I thought it could have used some bacon.  This just wasn't the sauce I had in mind.

This was very easy to make and tasted exactly like what I was looking for.  It was very buttery and yummy.  Only made one small change: I used 2 cans of minced clams and one can of whole baby clams.

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  I just sneaked a quick taste before I called everyone to the table, and it's the BEST clam sauce ever.  Even better than my beloved grandfather's.  Sorry, Pop.  Didn't have as much clams as called for, but it still rocks.

I made this for my husband and daughter--both clam lovers.  I guess they just didn't like white clam sauce as much as I thought they would.

This is the worst pasta I've ever made. I followed the receipe word by word and it turned out horrible. The sauce was so boring and tasted plain, even with the $20 wine I bought for cooking this dish.

This sauce is so delicious and simple to make.  I've made it almost every week since I discovered the recipe!  I scaled it to 2 servings and added about 10 sliced mushrooms.
Thanks, Jodie!

Jodie, this was great. My husband never orders anything but Linguini and Clam Sauce and he said this was the best. I added fresh mushrooms and parsley and steamed some fresh clams for the topping. Going to make again this weekend.
Thanks

Superb recipe! I don’t use wine, so I just add a little more clam broth. And I add a healthy smattering of crushed red peppers. Best clam sauce I’ve ever made, hands down.

I've made  this several times and it's excellent! I made a few changes: whole baby clams (canned),  increased wine to half a cup and added a tablespoon lemon juice and a tablespoon dried parsley. I like a little kick so I added a quarter teaspoon of crushed red peppers. I cut the butter in half and left out the salt. I put the clams in the last five minutes of cooking. Delicious!

I just made this for dinner.  We liked it very much.  I omitted the wine for my mom.  After reading the reviews, I added 1 xtra garlic and cut the amount of butter down. I did NOT add salt and we were all very happy! The clams & juice are salty enough.  I waited til 10 mins left and added fresh small clams.  Then with only 3-2 mins left, I added my canned whole clams.  It took only 5 mins for the fresh clam shells to open if you want a better judgement for cooking time.  I added parsley.

Very good easy basic sauce. I added extra garlic, and also shrimp and fresh mushrooms.   Just before serving I dusted it with fresh grated Romano cheese and minced fresh parsley. Delicious.

Made this using other reviewer's suggestions about using less butter and more wine/clam juice. Loved how this tasted. Next time I will use fresh clams in place of the canned, I feel it will make this recipe that much better.

Although I'm sure this recipe is great as-is, it's so unhealthy I couldn't bring myself to make it in that way.  I'm still giving it 5 stars, though, because the results after lightening it up were incredible!  I used 2 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. oil, and then I just filled out the rest of the sauce with clam juice (either from the clams or you can buy a little bottle).  This makes enough of a sauce for quite a few people, and although it still isn't good for you, it won't be awful for you either.  Very nice recipe, I will make it again.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I used fresh chopped clams since they were on sale at the fish market and I had to buy a small bottle of clam juice.  Other than that, I followed recipe to a tee and it was perfect.  A big hit in my family.  Thanks.

Absolutely great.  Just like the other reviewers said, this is just as good as in a restaurant. I added some fresh basil and a shake or two or red pepper flakes.  This is a keeper.

I made this tonight for my husband, I never had clam sauce before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was delicious!  Only additions were some lemon juice and italian seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe didn't taste bad but my family wasn't wild about it. It was a bit bland. I don't think I'll be making it again. Thank you, though.

This is a good, "always on hand" kind of meal. You can keep everything on hand and always have a nice meal right out of the pantry.

Good basic recipe that you can play with to suit your tastes. I had frozen leftover clams from a previous dinner, to which I added a bottle of clam juice, cut back the butter to two tablespoons, added red pepper flakes, parsley, garlic and onion powders and topped with parm. Gang loved it and thanks Jodie!

I took the advice of another posting and decreased the butter while increasing the juice and wine (I basicly doubled the amount of wine). This definetly needs something else to make it complete, I used a salt free herb season mix.  Add the clams about 5 mins before serving and garnish with parsley. I think maybe even adding a small amount of lemon juice would be good.

Excellent recipe - I love it - I may try to spice it up just a bit next time - parsley and I may have gone a bit light on the garlic.

Hmmmmm...this was easy and good, but not DELICIOUS...however, I have to say I used fresh, shucked clams (soaked them in salted water for an hour to make some "juice") instead of canned. But I imagine that canned clams, in this case, would actually have maybe more flavor?

I added canned mushrooms, a handful of fresh parsley and topped with fresh parm. These were good additions, I think. Served over pasta.

And, as is often the case, it was much better the next day after the pasta soaked up more of the sauce.

I reduced the garlic to 4 cloves and waited until the very end to add the wine in which I had added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch just to give the sauce a little more body.  We all loved this recipe!

Delish! I’ve made it twice with great success both times. Great as is yet flexible enough to make it your own. I added a single anchovy, red pepper flakes and basil. And of course, added the clams last. One more thing. I did use the full butter stick as I found it made the sauce thicker. A keeper!!!

Good, very good, not quite perfect.

Improvements:

- Hot pepper flakes to taste.
- I love butter, but this was too much. Halve it.
- Reduce the clam juice etc. but add the clam meat just at the end--no need to cook canned clams for 20 minutes.
- Needs more white wine. 2x or 3x or more, I don't know.

For those who say it's bland--don't forget to add salt and pepper to taste.

Turned out wonderful and tasty. I usually add more clams and save the other half of the juice to use if there are any left overs. Easy to make and everyone loves it.

Delish!  I used dry vermouth, and added fresh oregano, fresh basil, red pepper flakes and a generous splash of lemon juice.  I also used 3 cans of juice instead of two.  Doesn’t need additional salt.  This is definitely something i’ll be making again!

I have never reviewed this but have made it several times with great success. I use canned whole clams and I add the clam juice from the cans when I add the white wine to simmer it down and the juices impart that wonderful clam taste we expect. the baby clams I add after the linguine is done and being drained. These baby clams are too fragile to add earlier. The juices added earlier provide more then enough clam taste.

Mostly Followed recipe with substitution of flour pasta for frozen vegetable linguini. I only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and no butter. I added mushrooms and parsley. It was delicious!!! I got to eat half the recipe for 375 calories. Yay!!

This recipe can be altered to accommodate your personal taste. I added basil, chopped parsley, red pepper flakes, more olive oil and less butter for mine. Served over linguine  with parm-reggio cheese sprinkled on top.

Liked the recipe, just kicked up the amount of wine to half cup and did not put the clams in till the end of cooking. Also added a small amount of Old Bay seasoning. Would definitely make again.

I did not care for this recipe. Tasted only butter and onion, not the delicate clam, wine, and garlic I'm used to having in a clam sauce.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe as a base.  I did make some additions and the result was awesome.  
- I use chopped clams and included the juice

Here's what I added:

- Fresh chopped parsley
- 1 bottle of clam juice
- 1 CUP of wine
- More garlic
- Parm/Asiago/Reggiano Cheese as thickener
-Dash of Red Pepper flakes 

INCREDIBLE !!!

Wow. Delicious linguine! I only had one 10 oz can of boiled whole baby clams and 16 oz frozen oyster bay clams. I added towards the end. Used the clam juice from both. I added 1/2 cup Chardonnay and 1/4 cup Parmesan/Romano cheese. Lots of garlic. One small chopped red onion. 1 stick of butter. Simmered for 30 minutes. Yummy! I used the whole pack of linguine pasta. Also topped with grilled shrimp with Montreal steak seasoning and dash of creole seasoning. Sprinkled chili flakes and cilantro. Everyone loved it!!!  Will make it again. Thanks!

Came out amazing. Followed the recipe for the most part. Substituted one can of chopped clams for a can of whole baby clams and added some chopped parsley that I had on hand at the end. Absolutely delicious.

Yes, multiple changes. Used rinsed chopped baby clams and bottled clam juice to reduce sodium content. Added white wine, lemon juice, and chopped parsley to the sauce. Lastly swapped tri colored pasta for the linguini.

I halved this with the exception of 2T butter, not 4, which would be half the 1/2c.  I think this could use more white wine or lemon juice.  It was quite rich-butter-tasting; good, but a bit too much.   Oh, I put all the clam liquid in.  I liked it the most, but I expected that.  I won't make again for just me, but it's a good recipe.  E, 19, didn't have any the first night; ate a big bowl, but didn't say anything.  'Not a drop left.  Huh.  :D

This recipe is the best.  I didn't cut back on the butter either!!!    I already had a can of clams in white sauce so i drained that sauce off; used half of it in this recipe instead of adding chicken broth to increase recipe.  Also added 2 cans of whole clams.  Came out fabulous.  Oh, also decided to just mix in the linguine.   My prior attempt at linguine and clam sauce was a disaster.  This will now be my go to recipe!!

This was really good!!!!  My seven year old who would be happy eating cheerios for the rest of her life had two bowls.  The only thing I added was a coulple of shakes of red pepper flake to spice it up.

This recipe is so easy and possibly the best clem sauce I've ever eaten.  I used one extra baby can of clams, an extra TBS of wine, and I also squeezed the juice of half a lemon into the sauce as it was reducing. It was PERFECTION!

Good but not great. Not enough sauce to cover amount of linguini. Sauce lack flavor. Needed to add more salt.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars as others did because I did tweak the recipe some.  I added more wine and reduced the butter.  I also add the pepper flakes to it.  Nice flavor and very easy to make.  I served this dish to my boyfriend for a surprise dinner and he really enjoyed it.  I should also mention that he is an Executive Chef.

Fabulous!! I added mushrooms and left every thing else as it was. I found  the sauce a little thin. So if you like a thicker sauce I would toast a little flour with the onion garlic mix before you add any liquid or use a little corn starch.

I made this for my husband and he really enjoyed it! I had margarine in the house leftover so I used that instead of butter and still came out great! Would make again definitely!

Very easy. Doesn't need 20 minutes cook time though (clams might be too tough). I made home made pasta (that does take longer! LOL) I would say this is about a 10-15 minute sauce max. I added red pepper flakes for a bit of zing. Family loved it. I Not too "clamy" for my kids. My husband mopped up the pan with bread.

I loved it and so did the family. I only had canned clams - so I used 1 chopped can 1 minced can - I had some frozen shrimp I also threw in - I used 2 TB sherry and it was amazing.  I love this recipe..  I cut the butter to 4 1/2 tablespoons, added a 1/4 t red pepper flakes, 2TB chicken broth..  and def. some shredded parm romano cheese.   yum.  will make it again and again.

My kids loved it... that says it all!  I like my pasta dishes to be saucy, so we followed the advice of others and added more clam juice and white wine, but decreased the amount of butter to only a couple of Tbs.  We added other seafood, like scallops and shrimp, but did not add them until near the end of the cooking time so that they were not overcooked.  Definitely will be making this more often!

I made this for just myself one day because my husband hates the smell of clams cooking in the house.  It was so wonderful.  I could not stop talking about it and know my husband so well I told him he would love it if he tried it.  Two weeks later I was craving this dish again and I told him I was going to make it for dinner and he was not that thrilled.  When he got home he could smell the garlic and took a portion of the dish I had prepared and he could not stop saying how good it was.  He was even surprised that I used canned clams.  He loved it and said it would be OK with him if I served this often!!! This is a guy who really does not like white or red clam sauce and as I sit and write this review (3 days later) he wants to know when I plan on making it again!!  The only thing I did different was added garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce to help thicken it just a little and to give it even more of a garlic flavor.  And I used more white wine...I think I did that only to mask any "bad smells" of clams that he might have encountered right before he devoured it all.  Use the 20 minutes to reduce it as recommended because that really helps it.  I also served this over angel hair instead of linguini.

This was a good clam sauce, but I found it to be a little bland.  My sauces need a little more kick, and although I added a little seafood seasoning, it wasn't enough.  Perhaps I'll try more fresh herbs next time.  I did add mushrooms as well, which added some extra texture to the sauce.

This is a great recipe!  Easy to make and delicious--It's a great weekday meal.  Thanks for sharing it.  I like to add a big handful of fresh chopped parsley at the end to add some color and freshness.
