Not a tested recipe. It must be missing something. I made it but, 1) the suggested baking time was 15 min. too long. 2) it came out dense and tough.

Waste of ingredients.  Tough, oddly chewy for just 1 cup + 3T of flour.  Lacks flavor and sweetness.  Dry despite 4T of butter + 4 Eggs.  The only help for this recipe isn’t deleting it from the web.

I just recently moved into a new apartment and didnt have a springforn pan so I put it in a well greased Pyrex pan. Fingerscrossed it comes out okay. I may have to increase the cook time though. Overall the batter was luxuriously thick creamy and easy to make

Very good, but NOTE, line w parchment paper. Any used spring form pan leaks a bit. Batter is thin.

I added vanilla, used only 1 cup flour, used only 2 eggs, added brown sugar about 3 tablespoons, extra tablespoon of butter, and I did cupcakes bc no springfoam pan. They were cooked fully before even lightly brown on top. Made a very dense cake, like spongecake. Not dry. Less sweet than a regular vanilla cupcake tho. More of a muffin texture and very mild taste

Found a can of Eagle brand in the cupboard and looked for a reason to use it before it expired. Stumbled on this recipe and am I glad I did! My family loved it. Everyone even my husband (that hates sweets) had seconds. I did make a couple of changes because I used what I had on hand. Couldn t find my spring form pan so I just used an 8x8 square pan that I greased. I also discovered that I was out of icing sugar so I lightly buttered the crust and then sprinkled brown sugar on- almost a mock coffee cake at this point. Fantastic and easy recipe. My three year old daughter helped and that batter was very very well beaten before baking LOL.

I followed accurately. It didn’t rise enough and needed more flavor ( I added 1tsp. vanilla & 1 almond ext.). It was baked o.k., yet too hard. I’m guessing that was from the condensed milk. That’s why I made it, to see. I was surprised that it wasn’t lighter & flavorful.

This is a very good recipe. I added a little vanilla and a dash of almond essence. I baked it in an 8x8 glass dish and served it warm with custard. It was delicious. Thanks.

I was excited to try the recipe-good ingredients and easy. Unfortunately the cake is dry and tough. This recipe is NOT a keeper!

I see a lot of negative reviews for this cake.  I actually followed a similar recipe which called for more butter (2 cups), vanilla & almond extract.  It was an absolutely hit.  Try that!

I cut the cooking time by 10 mins, could just be my oven too? I tried it without adding the vanilla, like others suggested, came out perfect flavor without the addition. I used salted butter instead of the no salt butter, but I wouldn't do this again. I think the " tough" cake that others mentioned could be because of salted butter use? Just sayin.

Easy to make and delicious. Next time I'll give it 10 more minutes in my oven. A quick dessert for unannounced guests.

This recipe is average at best.  Following exact directions the result was dry, dense and not very sweet.  I recommend one less egg, another half can of condensed milk and cook for 35m not 45.
