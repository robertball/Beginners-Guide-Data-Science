I did not add the water called for in this recipe. I actually added about a half cup or so of evaporated milk I had leftover in my fridge from another recipe. I also added a good amount black pepper. My three boys INHALED this. No leftovers. NOTE: I actually figured out that with sales and price matching, this whole meal (if you count the large canteloupe we all shared as well) cost us 3.49 or 87 cents each person. This fed one very hungry husband, two very hungry growing boys and one mother for breakfast. Not going to complain about that.

Just for the record, I made no claim that this was "Southern-Style". That was added by allrecipes.com. My claim was tasty and easy.

Definitely not any southern gravy I have ever had. We don't add mushroom soup to our gravy. You make great gravy with a roux of bacon or sausage grease, flour, salt and pepper and then add milk and water to make a really good gravy. This was ok but definitely not what I call good southern gravy.

This is an easy way to learn....Use spicy sausage...no extra water is really needed, at the least, just add half the water. It ended up a little runny with the full 2 cups of water.Quick to make! Thanks!

I AM southern and although I haven't used mushroom soup for sausage gravy, I fully intend to, I DO use it for a shortcut when making fried foods and rice or potatoes.  Love it!  For a change I use the mushroom with roasted garlic.  All recipes are the taste of the the one preparing it.

Try using about a half a cup of milk instead of the water...it'll be too runny with that much water, and the milk will make it taste a little better. Also, use hot breakfast sausage and add plenty of black pepper. This isn't as good as the "real" recipe, but it's really not that bad for beginners or those who want to get breakfast on the table quickly.

I used a little milk just  to kind of give the cream of mushroom a little wiggle room. Added salt and pepper definitely  for the traditional taste, and of course used a little amount of my sausage grease to give it that savory sausage robust flavor and turned out yummy! This recipe is actually a cool one as well. As far as Southern and all that stuff goes, it's whatever the cook likes and their household. Every household that I have been to everyone use different ingredients. It's fine to see how everyone else cooks their favorite meals.

Nice flavor and much easier to make than the flour and milk mixture. I chose this recipe because I wanted to make sausage gravy and biscuits but didn't have enough milk for both the gravy and the biscuits. So I hit AllRecipes ingredient search looking for a recipe that didn't call for milk. This fit the bill and turned out very tasty. I would agree with the comments that say to reduce the water as I had to cook it down quite a bit. All in all it's a keeper!

There is no homemade biscuits or gravey. Nothing is being done to the sausage other than turning on the heat. Canned soup with basic water. I'm not sure where the 'southern' part of this receipe is. 

If your going for quick and easy, absolutely. If your going for southern, not a chance. 

Regardless if your going for quick and easy or southern, This is also not gravy. Its water with mushrooms in it. Do not add an ocean of water. You need 1/2 cup to 1 cup of water.

Not bad.  We substituted milk instead of water and only had pre-cooked turkey sausage links on hand, but it was super easy and the kids loved it.
