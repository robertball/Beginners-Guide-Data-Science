this recipe got me to thinking,"powdered sugar in lemonade?" so i had to try it. what a disappointment. the sugar did not dissolve or sweeten the lemonade. also, only 3 cups water to the juice of 7 large lemons is not right. to salvage the lemonade i added enough water to make 3 quarts, strained out the chopped mint and undissolved powdered sugar, and added a half cup granulated sugar and 1/8 cup marrionberry syrup that i had on hand. finally a drinkable lemonade. the only part of this recipe that i did like was the mint, but next time i make lemonade i will run the mint through the juicer with the lemons to eliminate the step of straining out the mint leaves.

make sure you use MEYER lemons!! Not regular lemons! Meyer Lemons are much sweeter.  I used half the amount of sugar with regular sugar and it was wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used 7 Meyer lemons and got about 1 1/3 cups lemon juice from them.  The confectioner sugar blended beautifully but gives the lemonade a chemical sweetness that I wasn't crazy about.  The mint is a nice pop of flavour - since some people don't like mint in their lemonade I offered the chopped mint on the side.  Good lemonade, but I think I'll use a simple syrup next time.

I use just a bit less sugar (I like my lemonade on the sour side!) and use fresh-picked chocolate mint (a variation I found at my local nursery) from my garden. Unexpected and really tasty flavor.
