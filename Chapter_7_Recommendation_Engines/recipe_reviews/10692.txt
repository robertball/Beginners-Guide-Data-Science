Pretty good! Easy to make and my boyfriend LOVED them. I thought they were pretty good, but didn't like them as much as he did. Surprisingly, an airier texture and not as sweet as you would expect. I didn't have the hard candies, but otherwise made as specified. Will keep and use again.

I loved this, so did my husband and son. I followed instructions perfectly.Well, first  batch i left in for 12 minutes out of habit but they were too hard for my taste, 7 minutes was perfect in my oven and they are soft, chewy and not too sweet. I loved this!!!

I'm not rating these based on my tastes (not a chocolate cookie fan so much) but rather for my extended family.  I was looking for a recipe to use up several ingredients in my pantry to keep things from falling and ran across this one.  I made half a batch and gave some out, but they had to come back and beg for the rest because they loved them!  I left out the chocolate hard candies because I don't even know what they are!  I baked them for 7 minutes because that's when the tops weren't shiny any longer, and I thought they could have gone a little longer.  I guess it didn't matter because they are all gone!  Thanks, Mary Strickland!

These cookies were sort of a disappointment to me because I was expecting a firmer, sweeter cookie. However, if you're the type of person who likes softer cookies that are semi sweet, than this recipe is perfect for you. These cookies weren't my favorite but my mother loved them.

I followed the recipe fully, except I was out of chocolate chips. Used crushed M&Ms and raisins instead. Baked them for 8 minutes... They're amazing! Can't believe more cooks haven't tried this easy and delicious cookie!!!
Update: for those who want a crisper, harder cookie, leave out the second egg but keep all the other ingredients at the same amounts.

Airy texture indeed. I added raisins instead of white chocolate chips as I didn't have any.
