The first time we tried the recipe it was great but needed some extra help. We replaced the bacon with ½-pound Italian sausage cooked and finely chopped in a food processor. We added ¼ cup diced onions and 1 more cup of water. We found during first time, after adding the pasta, the soup was bit too thick. We also halved the salt (½ and ¼ teaspoon), because after adding cheese, we found it a little salty. We also substituted pasta with whole-wheat elbows. The recipe was a 5 star to start, the 2nd time we made it with these modifications we needed 6th star!

Overall this was great soup...very close to Olive Garden..I substituted the bacon (why bacon??)for Italian sausage which was much better. I also omitted the salt..didn't need it at all. Next time I will cut down on garlic...whoaaa! 1/8 of a teaspoon of garlic powder is equal to 1 clove..and this recipe totalled 9 cloves! No one came near me for days! Update-use fresh spinach and add at the end. Also, use cannellini beans instead of northern.  Yum!

EXCELLENT!  Thanks for a great recipe.  My husband had been asking for this for a while but doesn't like the kind of Fagioli that is too tomatoee.  This one was perfect.  Used frozen spinach and added a little olive oil, chopped onions and Italian Seasoning.  Will make it again, especially on cold winter nights.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. To "kick it up a notch" I use crumbled hot italian sausage in place of the bacon, add a dash or two of crushed red pepper, include the liquid from the spinach, and use one of those "Natural Goodness" boxes of chicken broth. The seashells tend to asborb a lot of the liquid after sitting for a while, so I like to use the small shells, and fewer than 1/2 the bag.  I get rave reviews on this ALL THE TIME and it is some of my friend's favorites!

EXCELLENT! I did saute some chopped onions and a stalk of celery with the minced garlic before hand. It really made a difference! I didn't have a 29 oz. can of diced tomatoes so I just used one can of 14.5oz of the "petite diced" tomatoes. It doesn't need 8 slices of bacon, it gave it a great smoky flavor with 3 or 4. It turned out fabulous!! Very quick and easy.

Not sure quite how to rate this, 'cause I did make quite a few changes based on other reviews and my own preferences, but the soup I ended up with was AWESOME!  I began by sauteeing 1/2 an onion and celery in about 2 tsp of olive oil in my Dutch oven.  Once the veggies were tender, I added the 2 cans of undrained beans, 6 cups of chicken broth, an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 cup of water, 2 tsp of minced garlic and the spices... although I cut back to 1/2 tsp of salt since I used more broth, and also added 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.  While simmering for the 40 minutes, I sauteed 1 lb hot turkey italian sausage (removed from casings) and then drained the excess grease.  Once the soup was done simmering, I added a package of FRESH spinach and it wilted within a couple minutes, and then stirred in the sausage.  I added about 1.5 cups of whole wheat elbows and simmered for another 5 minutes, then removed from heat, so they gradually cook the rest of the way while the soup cooled.  I added fresh parmesan and fresh cracked pepper to each serving and it was one of the best soups I've ever had! Thanks for the jumping off point!

I come from an Italian family. A real Italian recipe uses fresh everything. I used Italian sausage, fresh crushed tomatoes, fresh spinach, fresh garlic, fresh parsley, oregano and basil.....and it was wonderful. Baked 2 loaves of french bread and it was a meal to remember......I will use my version from now on.

This was very impressive. I used a 14.5 oz can of toms., frozen spinach and  only 1 cup of dry pasta.  I didn't have regular bacon but had Wright's ends and pieces, used for seasoning.  I cooked the pieces then picked off the meaty parts. I tied the fat into a piece of cheesecloth and added it back to the pot for more flavor. This will be a regular.

I didn't read the reviews before I made this, and wished I had. When I make this again, I plan to reduce the tomatoes/tomato sauce, the salt/garlic, and use crumbled sausage. Good recipe!

Wow!  This is soo good.  My husband and I ate it for DAYS.  I only used 3 slices of bacon and sauted it with a chopped onion as the first step in the process. I think that the next time I make this, I'll fry the bacon until crisp as suggested.  It makes a lot, and goes well with a good crusty bread and wine.  Thanks for the recipe.

The changes I made were omitting the bacon and doing about 3/4 lb. of mild Italian sausage (cut up into small pieces), adding an additional 2 cups of water (so 5 cups total), using a bag of frozen spinach instead of canned, only using one teaspoon of minced garlic instead of one tablespoon (way too much), doing ditalini pasta instead of shells, and reducing the salt down to 3/4 tsp instead of 1.5 tsp. Very yummy, hubby ate it right up.

Yummy recipe!  I made it vegetarian and used fresh ingredients - one kilo fresh cranberry beans in place of the canned beans, fresh grated tomatoes in place of the canned, fresh spinach - one large bunch, chopped and added at the end of cooking time.  Also used rosemary, fresh parsley and left out the bacon, adding a bit of freshly grated parmesan.  Okay, sounds like a whole new recipe - but it was delish!

Pretty darn good! I substituted bulk italian sausage for the bacon, as I'm not s bacon fan. It made a ton of soup and yummy. I used ditalini as that's the pasta I had. One thing I would change is the spinachy flavor. Next time I think I'll use fresh spinach, I think that will make a difference.

A very nice soup. I omitted the bacon, because I don't really care for bacon in most soups or pasta dishes. I didn't have any Italian sausage but if I make this again, I'd like to try it with sausage. I used 5 clumps of frozen spinach, and one can of white beans and one can of chickpeas. I also added some red pepper flakes, but it could have used more of a kick. I would definitely use a bit less tomatoes next time. Good though!

We thought this was fantastic! Here are the minor changes I made to suit our tastes: 1 can of kidney beans in place of the 2 cans of northern beans; I used fresh basil and parsley from my garden (though dried would be fine); and I used fresh chopped spinach rather than frozen. Very tasty. The bacon gives it a nice smokey taste. Just be sure to salt it only to taste as it could easily be overdone if you use a salty chicken broth or the full amount of bacon. I added only 1/2 tsp and it was plenty for us. Also, if you are not going to consume all of the soup in one meal, I like to boil the pasta on its own and add it to each individual bowl as I serve it. This keeps it from absorbing all your liquid or becoming soggy when you store your left overs.

This was really good -- with a few changes. I did not try it with bacon, that didn't sound good to me.  I used a combination of italian sausage and beef, which I browned in olive oil along with about 1/2 cup of finely-chopped onion, minced garlic, and one stalk of celery, finely chopped.  I used La Valle Italian tomatoes, which I think added to the flavor.  I also used frozen spinach.  It was very, very good!

Had a good flavor overall and was very easy...no chopping involved!  I did as others suggested and omitted the bacon and subbed in hot Italian sausage in its place.  I also skipped the can of tomato sauce and salt.  Will likely make again.  Also, the recipe made way more than 8 servings.  We put some in the freezer for an quick dinner on another night.

I thought this was great! I had to make a few changes: I added 1# italian sausage, I only had 1 can of the Northern beans & used dk red kidney beans as a sub for the 2nd can, I left out the bacon, added onion & fresh garlic, omitted the salt, and used ditalini pasta. After tasting I added some sage, marjoram, more basil & some sugar to cut down on the acidity from simmering the tomatoes. I may try adding bacon to the leftovers- I mainly didn't feel like cooking it in addition to making the soup. Overall great recipe & I'll make this again with the same modificaitons.

I don't usually rate recipes but this is so quick and delicious. The only changes I made were to saute 1/2 chopped onion, 6 cloves minced fresh garlic (we love it) and about 1.5 lbs of crumbled italian sausage in stockpot before adding rest of ingredients. I also used ditalini instead of shells, which I cooked separately to cut down on the starch. I will need to add more chicken stock to it today, since it thickened up quite a bit. Excellent!!!!

This was very satisfying and a perfect end to a cold winter day. 
A few modifications I made: Sauteed some onion and the garlic in some olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. Also added a couple celery stalks and a couple carrots. I used a bag of fresh spinach rather than the canned, since that is what I had on hand. Also used whole wheat pasta. Yummy, simple and fast prep work. Tastes even better the next day. I will deffinately be making this again! :o)

I made this soup for 150 people at my church, and everyone loved it!  It was so quick and easy--just put everything in the pot and let it cook!  The taste was wonderful--the spices were just right!

I might be the lone dissenter on this one.  This soup is just ok in my opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the taste was really flat and one dimensional.  I had to add some spice.  Secondly, I just really hated the canned spinach in this.  It actually made the soup taste like "can"  I think I would use fresh instead.  This did make a large amount of soup unfortunately I'm not sure it will get eaten.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  The hubs and all 5 kids loved this soup.  They even ate the spinach!  I used Italian sausage instead of bacon, but would definitely make it with bacon if I had it.  It would be good either way.  It would even be good if you made it vegetarian and didn't put any meat in it at all.  The only thing I would change is not to add the salt.  But that is just a personal preference.  The canned chicken broth would have made the soup salty enough for me (and I used low sodium), but my kids liked it just the way it was.  Next time I will leave the extra salt out and let them add their own.  The recipe also made A LOT of soup!  I almost cut it in half because it looked like it would make a lot, but decided to go ahead with the full recipe.  Now I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow and then some!!  Thanks for an easy, quick, yummy meal!

Excellent soup! The only thing I changed was that I used sausage instead of bacon. Family loved it! Brought it to work for a soup day, and it was the first soup to disappear! :)

Perfection!!!  We loved every bite of it!  The only changes I made was that I used 10 oz of frozen spinach and added it toward the end and used turkey Italian sausage instead of bacon.  Next time, I may parboil the pasta so the soup does not get so thick.  Great with crusty bread and a salad.  This one will be on our menu often.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Love, love, love this recipie.  It is fast, easy and the results are fantastic!!!  That being said, I did make some major changes mostly to reduce the level of fat and salt, so I could feel a little better about serving it to my family.  Sauteed and onion and 2 cloves fresh garlic in a dutch oven.  Then added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup finely chopped turkey smoked sausage to pan.  Added diced tomatoes, 1 can great northern beans and 1 can navy beans (rinsed and drained, to reduce the salt),1 - 2 cups fresh spinach, 2 cans chicken broth, tomato sauce, fresh parsley, salt, pepper and fresh basil if I have it, if not then I use 1 teaspoon of basil. Simmered for approximately 40 minutes, then added the pasta at the end, but not as much and the submitter recommended, maybe about 1/4 - 1/2 cup cooked pasta...  I like ditalini.  Anyways really great topped with parmesian cheese. I also like to add a couple of cups of cooked, diced chicken breast to the ingredients as they simmer as it makes the meal heartier...  Yum!

I just have to say Thank You!  This is soooo good.  I took Chicagocook's review tips and sauteed onion and celery with garlic first, only used 1 can of diced tomato and 5 strips of bacon as he/she suggested and I used a bag of fresh spinach and ditalini pasta just because that is what I had on hand.  The seasonings are perfection in this recipe - some fresh baguette and a nice ceasar salad and you have a wonderful meal.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I was amazed by this recipe. I was looking for something similar to the soup at Olive Garden, and this was incredible. I didn't have tomato sauce or a can of diced tomatoes, so I substituted Four Cheese Speghetti Sauce and fresh diced Roma tomatoes; it still turned out perfect!

Very easy to make with ordinary items you always have in your kitchen...I used the 8 servings recipe but cut the beans to just 1 can and used fresh parsley instead of dried. We liked it a lot and will make this again. Next time I may try increasing the chicken broth instead of using the water for even more flavor.

I love soups that eat like a meal, and this recipe certainly does.  My husband isn't crazy about bacon, so I substitute Canadian Bacon in place of it.  I also use a whole pound of Dinatelli pasta in place of the sea shells.  Good stuff!

Delicious! Had to make some changes based on what I had on hand-- only used 1 can of beans (cannelini) and so used more pasta (3 cups dry of the ditalini); added half large onion, chopped (which I sauteed w/9 cloves fresh); only had 1 can chicken broth so had 4 cups water; and I had run out of basil so just used italian seasoning.  ALL that to say -- it STILL came out great! :)

This is an easy and delicious soup recipe. I used a 16-ounce bag of frozen chopped spinach and whole wheat elbow macaroni. It was a little too salty, probably because of all the bacon, so I will cut back on the added salt a bit the next time I make it. But overall a very nice soup. Looking forward to the leftovers.

Excellent recipe.  Lots of flavor.  Changes I made:  Used "Italian" canned tomatoes, added fresh chopped zucchini, and used only fresh spinach thrown in right before serving.  Thanks for this great recipe.  I'll be making it again soon.

Great recipe, the family loved this soup.  I added the frozen chopped spinach and Italian sausage.  I put a bit too much pasta so I added more water and broth.

i didnt' have all of the ingredients and it was still tasty. i used kidney beans and french cut green beans instead of spinach because i didn't have the others on hand. it cooked easily and fast and was great. i didn't give it 5 stars because though it was good it didn't keep me satisfied. maybe i will add ground beef next time

Great recipe.  I didn't have regular tomato sauce so Iused a tomato cream jarred sauce.  It actually made the soup taste creamier and added more of a tomato flavor.  I also left out the bacon to cut back on the fat.  Never missed it.

I was nervous to try this recipe, thinking my boyfriend wouldn't like it.  Boy, was I wrong, this is awesome.  Great flavor.  I did use italian sausage instead of bacon like other users suggested, you definately need to add more water because the noodles soak up alot, and I added an onion because I had extra around the house - not sure if that changed the flavor much or not.  Also I didn't have minced garlic so I left that out, it had enough garlic with the garlic powder.  Definately will make this again and again.

This s a great recipe but quite salty. next time I will omit the extra salt all together.  I used spicy Turkey sausage instead of bacon and it was perfect.  This is also quite a bit thicker than a soup - more like a stew, but wonderful - serve it Olive Garden style with breadsticks and a great little side salad.

I made this soup, with a few changes, and it is great.  Instead of bacon, I sauteed the garlic with a mix of turkey and lean ground beef...not much, probably between 1/4 and 1/2 lb.  Then I added all of the ingredients, except for the basil.  I boiled the pasta separately and add it separately.  This allows the soup to not get so thick, especially for the leftovers.  Great soup.

I made this for my Bunco group of 11 women.  While I tried to do it right, of course, I botched it up!  However, they all loved it!  I used my crockpot and started it early in the day... put the pasta in too early so it got mushy - oh well.  Forgot to put the spinach in (I bought fresh) but it still ended up okay.  I added fresh garlic (lots) and onions and then added more garlic and seasoning as it cooked.  It was quite tasty and the ladies loved it - mushy pasta and all!  Thanks for this one - husband also said to put it into rotation - without the spinach for him!

Hubby said "4.5 Stars", I said "3.75 stars".  I am not a great bean fan, so next time I may cut them in half, but all-in-all, it was pretty good.  I am sure I will make it again!

Delicious! Easy to make - I substituted turkey kielbasa for the bacon, and also added 1 tbsp. of oregano. Very tasty, will definitely make again!

This is one of our absolute favorites!  I make it for any friend who has just had a baby and am always asked for the recipe.  I'm a vegetarian, so I substitute vegetable broth and leave out the bacon.  I also have added/subbed with kidney beans and garbanzo beans.

This recipe was fantastic! I used Italian Sausage and Chorizo instead of Bacon though. And I accidently cooked the pasta too long which thickened the soup quite a bit. So keep and eye on the timer ;-)

recipe calls for way too many noodles and too much bacon; besides, italian suasage is probably a better choice. but the flavor is great -- try adding celery, different beans, carrots -- a good recipe to build on and make your own.

Angela - great soup! My husband and I made this last night, and couldn't wait to have it for lunch today. I wasn't sure whether he'd like it - he typically isn't interested in something with a lot of canned ingredients. So, I added frozen spinach instead of canned, and he added a large onion, some Lea & Perrin, and a bay leaf. We'll definitely have it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was great!  Following the advice of some others, I only added one can of diced tomatoes and about 1/2 the bacon and no additional salt.  I also used one can of cannelline and one great northern bean and added some carrots.  After the addition of the pasta, I used ditalini, it really thickened, so I added another can of broth and a small can of tomato sauce...it makes alot and is delicious when topped with the grated cheese!  I strongly recommend it.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews and was disappointed.  I felt the soup was too liquidy and tomato-ey.  Next time I would only use a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes rather than the 29 oz. it called for. I also only used large seashell pasta as thats what I had on hand and perhaps it would have been better with smaller pasta.  I think I will stick to my tradional way of making pasta fagioli.  Thanks anyway.

We used 1/4# prosciutto ham in place of the bacon and replaced the parsley and basil with 3tsp Herbs de Provonce. An outstanding soup.

This is a great recipe.  Easy to change to the eaters likings (more beans, less spinach, etc.) I've served it to people who said they didn't like pasta fagioli.  They love it and always ask for the recipe.

I've made this over and over...and it always gets great reviews! Also works well in a crock pot set on low--just add the pasta the 1/2 hour or so and turn up to high.

Absolutely delish!!  I didn’t have plain diced tomato so used the one I had with oregano basil and garlic. That was a good “ mistake”  !    Cut down on the added spices. Also next time ( which will probably be next week!!) I will only put in about 6 ounces pasta. The 8 ounces made It a little too thick and less broth. Otherwise many raves over it!!

This is a very good, easy recipe. I omit the bacon and I don't add the pasta into the soup. I find that adding pasta to soup makes the pasta smushy. I prefer to cook some ditalini pasta on the side and just add to soup when I am serving. But the recipe itself is very tasty and I will make it again!

Ugh.  It is such a disappointment when you spend precious time and money on a recipe.  Easy?  Yes.  I will give it that, basically dumping cans into a pot.  I think the worst ingredient is the canned spinach.  I wish I would've known to use fresh.  The crispy bacon expands and gets soggy in the watery broth.  Just a complete disappointment.  Blech.

Great recipe!  This is my go-to soup recipe because my family loves it.  It is so easy to adapt to what you have on hand or your own preferences.  Also, I make it as it is or can easily add any protein of my choice.  This freezes well too.

Love this recipe and so does my husband, parents and landlord. I changed a few things though. Used fresh spinach, Canneli beans, used cut up sausage and fry it instead of bacon and of course added carrots and celery because who has soup without carrots and celery?!

I added additional vegetables such as celery, red onion, mushrooms and zucchini. I used black beans instead of northern beans and fresh spinach leaves instead of canned. I substituted tomato paste for the tomato sauce.  It made a very thick hardy meal my family loved!

This is a very good recipe! Although I would highly suggest adding Italian seasoning to the ingredients.

It might not be a truly real Italian recipe--I'm sure fresh everything can't be beat--but my family loved the soup.  I made similar changes: used sausage instead of bacon; chopped up fresh garlic (lots!), onions, celery, carrots and sauteed them in olive oil before adding remaining ingredients, and added Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper.  My hubby cannot eat gluten so i used gluten-free rotini.  It's a keeper recipe for us--will definitely make again.

I used fresh baby spinach and this came out great! I used whole wheat penne and increased the amount because I like it thicker. So good for a cold night!

This soup was good.  Not a big fan of the bacon in it b/c it got really soft and mushy once mixed with all the liquid and I like my bacon crisp.  Maybe if I just cut down on it or used sausage like other suggestions.    Used fresh spinach.  I also sauteed some onion with a fresh clove of garlic (instead of a whole tbls) and omitted the salt due to the high content in bacon and broth.  Should probably cut the recipe in half for my family of 2 kids, 2 adults b/c after 2 days nobody wanted to eat it anymore and it got wasted.

Very Good. I used a turkey ground beef instead of the bacon. I  added 1/4 c white onions, and added Zucchini and  fresh spinach the last 10 min. Would make it again.

Based on other reviews I also substituted Italian sausage for the bacon and made these other adjustments as well, used additional  chicken broth inplace of the water, used frozen spinach ilo canned and eliminated the garlic power and only used 1 tbs of fresh garlic. Served with parmesan and the family loved it.

Great the first day but, if you freeze it fot later, the bacon becomes overwhelming. If you plan to have extra, delete the bacon.

This is a great recipe. I omitted the bacon and used ground Italian sausage instead. I also used fresh spinach and beef broth, rather than chicken broth. This is a delicious, hearty soup.

Oh YUM!!! I used a bit extra bacon and cooked the soup down so the flavors were a little stronger...way better than the Olive Garden soup which I remember as being pretty bland. Thank you for this recipe! I will use it often.

In order to make this recipe even healthier, I replaced the bacon with clams, used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and used fresh parsley and spinach instead of canned or frozen. We like "fusion" dining so we ate it with Mexican oven-baked corn tostadas.

I printed this out over a year ago and have used it so often i can make it blindfolded and my kids won't eat it anymore! LOL  So after a long break i'm making a couple changes and trying it again.  i've never used the bacon or the tomato sauce -- just don't have them on hand normally.  they object to spinach (in the past i've used frozen chopped), so this time i substituted carrots and celery.  i do have some fresh spinach that i'll add to mine!  we're using tortellini as the pasta, and i'm making it in the crockpot.  undecided as to whether i should eliminate the water, cook the tortellini separately and add at the end, or toss it all in there together. i usually do the pasta separately as it tends to get stew-y after sitting together overnight.

This was wonderful soap. I made this for my Mom who will soon be 93. I need to be sure she eats healthy. She loved it. My sister-in-law and brother-in-law also thought it was great. I still have some in my freezer. I will take it out in a couple of weeks.

A very nice recipe that has plenty of room for adjustments and personal tastes. I used fresh spinach and added a can of peas. Didin't want to use bacon so I browned chunks of mild italian sausage instead. Yum! I also chopped 1/4 of a vidalia onion, used fresh parsley and threw in a little sugar and crushed red pepper. I felt like the soup lacked richness so I poured in a little olive oil and right at the end tossed in about 1 Tbsp. butter. Served it with grated parmesan cheese and "Whole Wheat Beer Bread" from this site. Great!!

Great! So many great flavors and textures in this soup. We followed recipe except we only added 3 slices bacon and did not add water, but did add extra can of chicken broth (low sodium).  In addition, we added some shitake mushrooms and 1 and a half teaspoon chipotle Tabasco sauce to make it more smokey flavor.  Added combo of freshly ground Romano and Parmesan cheese before serving.

I was a little disappointed with this one.  I followed several reviewers suggestions and added a bit of onion, celery and italian seasoning but it ended up tasting really tomato-y.  Just not quite what I was expecting.  Do appreciate the recipe though, thank you!

This was good, but I was hoping for an Olive Garden clone and this is def not it.  Used frozen spinach rather than canned (yuk), and skipped the bacon, added italian sausage and ground beef.  I think it might be better/richer with a beef broth base rather than the chicken.(?) Again, good, but not what I had in mind, so I'll keep searching...

Very good.  I followed some other's suggestions - added celery and onion in with garlic fried at beginning.  Also added 1 tbsp oregano and 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, along with a splash of red wine.  Used frozen chopped spinach and Italian sausages instead of bacon.  Very good!

Yummy!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and cooked the bacon with some onion as the 'base' of the soup.  I also used frozen spinach (added it when it was frozen solid) and used 2 cans of chicken stock instead of the water.  YUM!  Even my husband (picky-picky) enjoyed it.  Makes for great leftovers for lunch.   Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I did make a few changes though.  I only added a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, used cannellini beans instead, omitted the bacon, garlic powder (1 TBSP of fresh garlic was enough) and salt and used mini penne pasta (1 cup) since I didn't have ditalini. Everything else was to the recipe. Everyone raved about it.

Delish!  I didn't put any bacon in and ommitted the garlic powder because I felt the 1 tablespoon of minced garlic was enough for us.  :)  Very good, we'll be making this often.

This is a great soup! I only make a half batch at a time. I have also made it without the pasta and extra beans; my husband actually prefers it this way. Super simple and good

Great basic recipe! I modified it a bit, though. I used spicy italian sausage(removed from casings) that I browned with half an onion before adding it to the soup. I also used a large bunch of fresh spinach instead of canned. The soup thickened a great deal on the second day of reheating. I will use much smaller pasta next time, though, because after re-heating, the pasta broke down quite a bit. Very good, though. I served it with fresh baked bread and grated grana padana cheese. Wonderful for a snowy day!

I thought my pasta fagioli was really good but this recipe is even more flavorful and delicious.  My whole family of 6 gobbled it up.  Will definately make again and again.

This was wonderful!  I used turkey bacon, low sodium chicken broth, and ditali pasta.  I don't think the extra salt is necessary, unless you like a very salty soup.  My husband loved this recipe.  We are trying to eat soup once a week, and this one will be in our rotation.  Thanks so much!

I really liked this- I made a big batch for lunches all week.  I added a bunch of spinach, two small zucchinis and a couple carrots.  I also added more shells than it called for, which made it a little dry so I added another can of tomato sauce.

A very wonderful and hearty soup Angela! I replaced the water with more chicken broth, added carrots, green beans and celery and even threw in chorizo sausage that I found in the freezer. We're a soup lovin' family and this recipe was no disappointment!

I made this for a winter dinner party along with Italian Sausage Soup and it got rave reviews!
I used one can of Great Northern and one can of Cannellini beans which added a bit more interest.  Also, I kept the soup on low heat while serving and found that I needed to keep adding chicken broth to keep it from getting too thick.
Many have told me that this is the best Pasta e Fagioli they have ever had! =)

My husband (who is a picky eater) LOVED this soup.  He can't stop talking about it.  He told me to add it into the regular rotation.  And it was decision for lunch on a cold winter's day.  Kudos to Angela:)

Good flavor, but a little bland.  Add extra crushed red pepper flakes.

Very tasty. Once again, this soup was made for "soup day" at work. I helped one of our male co-workers with the soup....it was a hit (they didn't believe he made it). I'm making it tonight to have at home. Suggestion: used frozen spinach instead of canned.

Very good!  Our family enjoyed it.  I did not use the garlic powder.  Next time, I'm going to try it without the bacon for a low-fat version.

Great Soup! 
Alterations: I used 1/2 cup of red wine, in place of 1/2 cup of the water (Therefore used 1/2 cup red wine & 2 1/2 cups water).  Also used 2 Italian sausages in place of bacon (fried & crumbled). Used fresh parsley and white pepper instead of black.  LOVED IT! Will make it again!

Yum!!  I substituted the bacon for 2 Turkey Italian Sausages (cooked and crumbled).  And, like the moron that I am, I forgot the pasta (who's ever heard of pasta figioli without the pasta??), but it was still so hearty and so so good!  I will definitley make this again (with the pasta next time...)!!

This is a great soup for fall. I will efinately be making this again.  I used turkey bacon instead of the real stuff and it was still great!
