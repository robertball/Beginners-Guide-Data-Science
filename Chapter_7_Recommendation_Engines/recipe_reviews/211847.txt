This is a delicious risotto recipe! And yes, I did make changes. I threw in 1/4 cup of white wine after sauteeing the onion and rice, which is what most risotto recipes call for. I also tossed in some parsley with the parmesan, cheese and bacon. Wonderful.  As for those who don't like people giving high ratings to a recipe they've modified, well, I think that's the beauty of this site. You have the basic recipe, which is fine. But if you're like me and are a experienced home cook, you can look at the variations and see how it can be made better or to your own liking.   Sure, it'd be great to be able to make a recipe as written, then make it again with your own additions, but who the heck has time for that?

Yum!!!  This risotto is absolutely amazing.  I lived in Italy for three years and this recipe tastes completely authentic.  I used cubed Pancetta instead of bacon and shallots instead of onions, doubled the Parmesan cheese, then added diced Roma tomatoes and frozen peas right before serving.  It was so good that my husband and I both went back for seconds and then ate the remainder for lunch the next day!  It took almost exactly 20 minutes to absorb all of the broth.  It took a lot of stirring, but it was so worth it.  Can't wait to make this again!

this was amazing!  so worth the time it took to stir it constantly!  i also sauteed some sliced fresh mushrooms in a bit of the bacon grease and added those at the end with the bacon.  it was so creamy and savory, I actually licked the serving spoon - I can do that, I live alone!

I have to disagree with one post~I like the modifications that people sometimes use on recipes. That's part of the fun of cooking...experimenting.  I like to see what other people have done to make the recipe better, and besides, everybody has different tastes and dietary restrictions, so, in my opinion, modifications are definitely a good thing:)

This is DELICIOUS - my whole family absolutely loves it.  The second time I made it I modified just a little, using turkey bacon and organic / low-sodium chicken stock and it was still wonderful.  I can never make enough, we always finish every last bite!  A MUST TRY!

Wow!  If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  Excellent flavor and well worth the indulgence.  I used a mix of rice, barley, and spelt instead of just rice and I cooked the onions, garlic, and rice mix in the bacon drippings and didn't use any butter.  I didn't have any Parmesan, so I used a handful of shredded Italian cheeses.  Even as a main dish, I think that this would make more than 4 servings - more like 6-8.  That's ok for us since we're looking forward to the leftovers!

I used shallots instead of onions in this and used less bacon and less rice because I make risotto every two weeks or so for my family of three and know that we always have leftovers when I use one cup of rice.  I added some fresh basil and tomatoes right at the end of cooking, before I added the parm and butter and this was delicious.  Both my husband and my toddler loved this dish, which is saying something.  Excellent recipe- and our house smells divine in the aftermath.

Just one suggestion:   Don't drain the bacon grease; cook with it!  Saute the onion and garlic in the bacon fat to add a beautiful undertone of bacon flavor to the whole dish.

Oh wow! This is so good. Very easy too. This was the first time I've made risotto. I did use store bought stock which made it a bit to salty. But that is my fault not the recipes. I can't wait to try it with homemade stock. Yummy! Thanks!

This was SO delicious!  I cooked the bacon in the same pan as I made this dish in, and just drained the fat out of the pan when I took the bacon out.  I deglazed with couple of splashes of white wine before I added the risotto in toast and doubled the parm because we like ours cheesy.  Will definitely be making it again!

I added a couple of handfuls of frozen peas a minute before serving. I think it adds an interesting texture and sweetness to the dish.

I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was perfect...just a little left over.  We loved it!  I think the recipe is great as is, AND I agree that you can play with this to cater to your own personal taste.  We added mushrooms to the bacon while it was cooking.  I imagine nuts would also be good in it.  Can't wait to try this recipe again.

WOW, this was an AMAZING side dish for lobster tails and baked onions I made for Christmas dinner.  I think this risotto was my favorite part of the meal--pretty outstanding when LOBSTER is the main course!  It was my first time making risotto and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for this recipe!

I did not deviate from the recipe at all and it was great.  My husband had 3 helpings.  There is a lot of stirring involved, but it is well worth it.

Wow! Soooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the bacon preparation.  I microwave bacon, which makes it extra crisp.  Cover a plate with three paper towels, several strips of bacon, and two paper towels on top of that.  Microwave for about six minute, checking every two minutes for doneness.  Let cool slightly, and throw in a blender for easy chopping.  I also cooked the rest of the lb of bacon this way, and garnished each serving with a full slice.    Important note: I had to keep adjusting my stove, and most of the time the rice was cooked at medium-low.  If I left it higher, the stock would dissolve too quickly and the rice wouldn't have enough time to soften.    Definitely a keeper!

Good simple base for a Risotto - lacked some "interestingness" but worked well as a family meal. I'd probably substitute the bacon with Italian sausage in the future for a bit more interest

I have not made it yet, but based on the written recipe definitely will be making it.  I wanted to comment on the reviewer who said it was too salty.  Well, DUH, you doubled the bacon and the cheese so of course it is going to be too salty!

Oh my goodness! This is really a must try recipe, I've made it a few times now, who knew risotto could be so easy? I'm in love with bacon risotto!! I'm a little suprized at the 4 servings, it made enough for at least 6-8 people as a side dish. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Loved, loved, loved this!  This is a relatively simple risotto, but it still had great flavor.  We made it as a side for our Christmas duck, replacing a more complicated risotto we've made in the past, and it was wonderful.  It was so good, I'll make it other times during the year as well.

This was amazing.  Very flavorful and really not that hard to make.  My 8 year old could not get enough.  I love reading everyone's recommendations for different variations and cannot wait to try it with  shallots and pancetta next time.

First time making risotto and I couldn't be happier with the results.  I feel like a profesional chef!  This recipe is perfect.  It's so creamy and comforting and delicious!  Instead of mixixng the bacon in I sprinkled it on top of each individual serving.  This risotto reheats very well.

I had to sub asiago cheese vs. parmesan cheese, but the taste of the asiago is solid. Definitely make sure you get the bacon nice and crispy as it adds great texture. Also, it doesn't say to use the same saute pan that you made the bacon in...but I think it makes sense as it builds the flavor up. All in all, would highly recommend!

This was excellent and very filling.  We added tomatoes and peas to it.  Definitely a keeper, this will be excellent in the cold winter months!

Good risotto for starters like me.  I used the green onions as others suggested, and I will try it with pancetta also.  I would recommend using a lean bacon as much of the appeal comes in having a little firmness in with the creaminess of the rice.

This was my first time make Risotto, and it was delicious. I used a store bought stock, and it was fine, but I can only imagine how good it would have been with home made. I did over cook it this time around, but I can not wait to try it again, so yummy!

Very Good!  I used 4-1/2 cups broth and 1/2 cup white wine.  Also added some freshly shredded asiago cheese as I had some on hand.  Will definitely make again.

This was an "experiment" for me, since I'm not usually in the kitchen. It turned out amazingly great! My son tried it first and loved it. I later plated myself and loved the flavor. Very delicious! I believe I'll try this one again.!.

Ok, so I tried this one today. At the second liquid incorporation, I added a handful of frozen peas and carrots. I also changed up the meat as well. I used about a 1/3 pound of bacon and 1/3 pound chopped ham. Turned out fantastic. I served the risotto with some barbequed smoked sausage. The kids loved it!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  It may have been slightly less healthy, but I made it with extra bacon and it really added to the overall taste!  The directions were simple and I would absolutely make it again!

What a fantastic recipe! This is the nicest risotto recipe I have tried. Even my fussy 2 year old liked it. The only thing i added was some cooked chicken for a wee bit of Variety. ITs a keeper.

This was my first time making risotto, and the recipe sounded delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added in a bit more parmesean cheese), and it was very flavorful. However, it was SO salty- almost too much. I know it was primarily from the bacon, so maybe it is the type of bacon I used. I made this for my boyfriend as well, and he loves salty food probably more than he should. I have never heard him say something was too salty, and he felt that this was a bit much. I didnt add any salt and pepper to the recipe like it recommends (not on purpose, I just forgot to) and I'm glad I didn't. Not bad, just a bit heavy on the salt.

this is SO good. I save on dishes by cooking the bacon in the same pot as the rice, and leaving it in there with the rice while it's cooking. I don't notice a huge difference in flavor (you'd think it'd be extra bacony!). 
this is really delicious, I hardly changed the recipe at all. I don't add parmesan but it still tastes awesome.

WOW!!! That's all I can say about this recipe!!! This is my first time making risotto and it was amazing! I used canned chicken broth for stock and the "cheaper" arborio rice, other than that I followed recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! If you've never had risotto, I would recommend this one! It is definately a keeper, and I will be fixing it again real soon!!

this was delicious! so much so that my hubby wants it every week!! .
So I did do some different things w/ it. 
I first added the bacon, let it crisp up to your liking , then I added the onions, and garlic & BUTTER ( i wouldn't use as much as it said to use - I think 8tbsp would be enough for next time)- cooked it to your liking/ onions and garlic cooked thru - then I added the rice to it and let it cook together about 5minutes to let the rice toast up - 
then added the chicken broth enough to cover rice - until absorbed, then again and again until rice was completely opened - now I made 3 cups of rice and it used up 10 cups of chick broth so it took 40 min to cook - stirring constantly all 40 minutes.. it took some work BUT it was well worth it! so incredible..
the 2nd time I made it (the week after) I added portobello mushrooms to the bacon, onion and garlic & butter mixture and did above again... that was ALSO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!

seriously amazing!  this was my first time making risotto so I was a little nervous, but it turned out great!  I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and low sodium stock and it was great!  It took about 25-30min for the rice to soak up all the stock but the time spent was well worth it!

The bacon tastes great but it feels like it is missing something. On a side note, I think this tastes better reheated than fresh.

Delicious!! But a bit on the salty side. I'll cut down on it next time. I added mushrooms cooked with red wine at the end with the bacon.

Wow. This is like the carbonara of risotto... sooo good. It was very popular with the boyfriend, as well (of course, almost anything with bacon in it is a shoo-in). I did make some minor changes for our personal tastes: shallots instead of onion, added peas and unintentionally doubled the parmesan. (Didn't regret it.) I also fried some shrimp in the bacon grease along with some minced garlic and topped the risotto with it. I give this recipe two enthusiastic thumbs up!

a bit salty to my tastes, but my whole family loved it  i doubled the amount of cheese and bacon in the recipe and used olive oil instead of butter, but it was still really good

First time making risotto -- this was a good recipe to start with.  Bacon and cheese cover many mistakes...  I made chicken broth using Better than Bouillon and must have used too much because the rice tastes very chicken-y.  I'll definitely make this again, hopefully improving my techniques!

Delicious, although we love a little wine in it too so I added about 1/2 cup of wine while stirring.  I also like to add some chopped chives to the mix before I serve.  PS:  when I'm out of Arborio rice I also use Japanese short grain & it's all the same.

I loved this, next time will use some of the bacon grease.  Added a touch of white wine, and used only one can of chicken stock, and just added water....that way its not too salty.  Came out great.

I used an extra 1/2 cup of rice to make it 2 cups and added another cup of broth. I used pancetta instead of bacon and fresh parmigiano reggiano. Very good, excellent flavor. I was hesitant at first because I did not see white wine in the recipe but you don't need it. I will make again.

It was very good, I added twice the cheese (though I used an asiago/parmesan blend), red bell pepper, roma tomato, peas, fresh parsley and spinach. I would recommend these additions.

This was some pretty tasty risotto.  It ended up needing about 6 cups of stock and we cooked it for just about 20 minutes.  Added in some frozen peas per other reviews and a bit more parmesan cheese.  It had good, subtle flavors, and I would make again.

This was the first time I ever made or ate risotto and my husband and I were impressed!  After cooking the bacon I drained the grease and made the onions, garlic, and rice in the same skillet.  I only had 4 cups chicken stock so added a cup of chicken broth to make the 5 cups.  I also used white pepper.  I would have been happy eating just this for dinner.

This was DEEElish!  I accidentally ended up cooking the garlic and onions a little too long so they were carmelized - which turned out really good.  I think it probably added a lot of flavor.  I also added 3/4 cup cheese instead of 1/4 because we love cheese.  Didn't add the egg at the end.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It will be a keeper!

I made this risotto and my family says it was my best risotto yet ... Everyone raved about it. I followed the instructions except that I should've fried the bacon in a different pan and just used the bacon grease. Also we made bacon in the oven which we used as a garnish on every dish. AMAZING!

I didn't use any butter. Instead I put some bacon grease in when cooking the onion and garlic. 

And I added a poached egg and parsley to the top of the risotto when I served it. Yum!

A decent recipe, hearty and delicious.  However when following the recipe strictly I find that it needs something to brighten up the dish, as it is quite heavy with all the butter and bacon.  As many have said in their reviews about adding some veggies or herbs really helps bring out the full flavor.  -1 star for the recipe not calling for this but overall a good dish.

Amazing risotto..I used 6 cups of light chicken stock instead as after the 5 cups the rice was still really firm. I added peas within the last 5 minutes of cooking and I added extra parmesan cheese. It was creamy and delicious. It took me 40 minutes to cook it all together but definitely worth it..even though my arm is a little sore :D

only changed slightly as I was looking for something to do with leftover ham....made as directed but added smoked  ham in place of bacon. used 1/8 tsp of pepper (didn't want to overpower the delicate rice) and used no salt...thought with the butter and ham there was enough sodium in there already. I think this would be great next time with some mushrooms added.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was amazing! I used a chicken broth paste, and adjusted it to make sure there was not too much salt. It was creamy and cooked completely from start to finish, including chopping the onion and bacon, in 45 minutes. The best risotto I've ever had! I can't wait to add other things like bell peppers or mushrooms to this amazing base!

When I first made this recipe I followed it to a tee and now I've made it so much I just kind of started to wing it. I don't typically make it with bacon anymore but I feel it is a great risotto recipe to fall back to when you aren't looking for anything too fancy. The only problem I have when I make it is that my husband seems to want it every night for the next three weeks afterwards!

Way to salty... I will give it one more try by using
low sodium chicken broth, low sodium bacon, and
unsalted butter.. My wife and I had Risotto in Italy
and that was enjoiable..

This recipe is delicious! This is the first time I've cooked risotto though I've wanted to for months, and it was much easier than I expected!

The dish was so creamy, the chicken stock gave it a great base, I doubled the parmesan and added mushrooms and asparagus pieces but that's just for my taste. Will definitely be cooking this again, bacon is just such an easy meat to prepare :-)

Excellent recipe! My only complaint would be a tad too salty - between the butter, bacon and added salt it was a tiny bit too much. So next time will either use unsalted butter or cut out the added salt at the end. Great recipe, feels like comfort food :)

This is a great basic risotto recipe, thank you! I took some of the other suggestions and added 1/4 white wine, plus parsley, 1/2 lb of chorizo sausage, red bell pepper and more cheese. It was REALLY good. Smokey, sweet and creamy.   It was my first time making risotto so I probably did it wrong, but the risotto took way longer to cook than 20 minutes. I think I cooked it for 30-25 before it was tender. And I added a little water...  Will definitely make again!

This risotto is very good.  I also added corn.  I had a bacon corn risotto at a restaurant and tht's why I tried it.  We will be having this often!  Next time I may add some bacon fat instead of the first 2 Tbsp. Of butter.

This was my first try at making risotto - it was great! lots of stirring but definitely worth it... the only thing i'd change is adding a bit of something to make it a little more colorful and to enhance the flavor... maybe some peas or even broccoli.  I'll be making this one again!

Fabulous!  I didn't modify the recipe.  I did however add frozen peas and some sauted mushrooms.  Made me feel a little healthier.  Ha!  Try this recipe!  You won't be disappointed.

Delicious! I didn't have enough chicken broth, so I used half chicken broth and half ham broth. It had a great flavor. I also halved the butter and didn't miss it a bit!

Great recipe!!  I added some chopped up portabellas with about 10 minutes left of cook time (after second addition of broth) and it came out so good.  I would hold off on adding any salt unless the diner wants it as the bacon provides enough of that.

Very yummy!  I added some mushrooms that I sauteed in the bacon grease.   Used red onions because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a bit (2-3 tbl sppons) of dry white wine in the first round of adding liquid to the rice.

I used 1/4 lb bacon and 1/4 lb proscuitto and also doubled the parmesan.  It was divine...and RICH.  So divine and rich that we ate it as our main meal and almost made ourselves sick!!  I highly recommend serving this as a side with a lighter main dish such as grilled shrimp or fish!!

Awesome and Easy!  My wife loves Risotto, so I decided to give it a try and she is in heaven, she went back for seconds, I am going to fridge the rest and cut it into pieces bred it and fry it as I have seen at restaurants.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was simple and worked out great, doubled the parmesan cause I love cheese!  Thanks for the solid recipe!

My family loved this more than I did, perhaps because they are all bacon nuts. This was easy to prepare, the recipe was right on and it tasted as I imagined it would...very, very bacony. If you love bacon, this is for you. If I'm making it again, I'll do like 2/3 the bacon (my family will cry) to still get a little flavor but have it be more about the Risotto I love so much.

Dont get me wrong, I LOVE bacon.  But this is pretty one dimensional.  I could tell you how I could make it a 5 star recipe, but that would be rating my recipe.  This is a decent base recipe.

Delicious and very easy to make.  I have a 21 month old daughter who was happy to help me stir for 20 minutes!  I used turkey bacon and added some peas at the end for a little color.  I added some salt but thought it might not have needed any, so try it before you add salt.

Great risotto. I substituted chicken flavored rice-a-roni and therefore used the 2 TBSP of butter with the rice-a-roni. I sauted the onion/garlic in bacon once it was mostly done. The salty bacon taste really blended well with the sweetness of the onion and the parmesan. All and all a great basic recipe.

Excellent.  Added 2 tablespoons of extra butter (margarine).  Followed all other directions completely and it turned out amazing.  Total cook time after adding the broth was almost exactly 20 minutes.

Super yummy - definitely a household favorite with us.  I do skip the onions and I substitute a cup of the chicken stock with white cooking wine.  I also used olive oil instead of the butter.  Super good!

Of all the new recipes I've gotten from this site, this one has turned into mine (and my family's) favorite.  I make it as stated with the exception of the bacon - instead of frying the bacon I just cook it in the microwave and then cut into pieces.  It's near impossible to dice raw and I've not found any pre-diced bacon in the store.  The first time I cooked I thought I had made a mistake because when adding the chicken stock it looks like soup!  But it just takes time for the risotto to absorb the stock.  Anyhow, this dish is simple and excellent.  Easily a 5-star recipe.

Wow!! This recipe is fabulous! I did make a ton of changes so that’s why I gave it a four star. First off I didn’t have the rice so I googled it and exchanged the rice for basmati rice. I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese and 2 c. Shredded Mozzarellas cheese. I also added peas to the last broth add in, but next time I think I’ll add it at the end. Really great stuff! At the end I served it with crumbled turkey bacon. Yum!

Yummy! Poured most of the bacon grease out of the pan and sautéed some sliced mushrooms, removed them from the pan and added them back with the bacon.. ...everyone loved it!

I made this risotto exactly as written and it was too salty. The parmesan cheese is already salty,  so the bacon just made it saltier. We couldn't eat it.  Next, I will try this recipe without the bacon and see how it turns out.

I didn't have the fresh Parmesan so I used the spaghetti stuff.  Tip for bacon: use Hormel Black Label regular cut bacon it will impart a smokiness to the dish and elevate it to a whole new level

This was great. I deglazed the bacon pan with a bit of wine and cooked the rice in that pan. I also added chopped asparagus towards the end and it worked nicely.

The recipe is great.  I didn't like it because I think I overcooked it.  It was more the consistency of oatmeal rather than creamy rice.  I need to not have it on the stove for so long.  I might have to get a timer to check for time.  But I'll definitely try this recipe again.  You pretty much can't go wrong with bacon.  lol

This risotto is fine, but needs something. I'm going to use a 1/4 cup of wine before adding the broth next time for a kick of flavor. Also, my bacon did not need to go for 10 minutes; I'm going to reduce time off the bacon so it's less crisp next time.

Yummo. Totally rich and decadent with an amazing flavor. I added generous portion of white wine early on I. The stirring (along with a generous portion for myself as I stirred). At the end I added frozen peas and pearl onions. Very good. Will definitely make again.

Just finished eating this and it was AWESOME!!!  Only adjustments were to the quantity (love the serving adjustment on this site, makes it so easy to reduce for just 1 or 2 folks).  I also drizzled just a bit of the bacon fat into the butter used to saute the onions and garlic.
Will be making this again (and again) and will use some of the suggestions in other reviews like using some white wine at the beginning stages of adding the liquids.

LIke the video suggested, we garnished with parsley. We also deglazed the bacon with some white wine after removing some of the bacon fat, and cooked everything in the same pan. Our chicken stock was home made, though, so perhaps a little weak and thus needed to add extra salt at the end to give it some serious flavor! Overall, it was a very good recipe that we'll make again. 4 1/2 stars!

Really easy, especially taking the onion & garlic right into the bacon fat. Deglazed and reduced with white wine before adding the rice, which worked well. Only added butter with the parm and bacon at the end. Mm mm.

Very nice. Used about 280g bacon. Forgot to season with salt and pepper. Added a little fresh parsley at the end. Cooked the risotto in the rice cooker. Didn’t add the extra butter at the end; only the parmesan. Would definitely have this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Followed it exactly - tasty, but very salty (the stock, I guess). BUT looking through reviews, with folk saying 'hubby went back for thirds,etc', I halved the recipe for 2 of us, but added extra rice, just in case. It STILL wasn't enough for 2. Would make again, but would use the original measures (i.e. for 4 servings!)

One of my favorite recipes!  I LOVE garlic so I added a little more garlic. Instead of onions, I used shallots.  Instead of bacon, I used pancetta.  Pancetta is saltier than bacon so ease up on the salt :). Also added parsley with the cheese and parsley to garnish.  I tend to have to add an extra cup of chicken broth so I usually up broth to 6 cups.

My fiancé said he was making steak for dinner and I decided I wanted to make a risotto.  So I came up here for a recipe and since I absolutely love bacon, I had to make this one.  And I have to say, anytime I'm going to make risotto in the future, I will definitely be using this one.  For my first time cooking, it came out perfect and come on, who doesn't love bacon in almost anything.  Great recipe!

I'm nuts for risotto. So I'll definitely make this again. I can't recall making risotto without white wine before. So, I was curious about how I'd like this. But...bacon!

Good basic recipe. I usually like adding mushrooms but I don't have any. Luckily, I have bacon. I am used to adding white wine and so I did. I also added a few herbs from the garden. This recipe is good as is or expanded with what you have on hand.

This was good, but I feel like I should have made it without cooking with the bacon grease.  Too greasy and the bacon flavor is overpowering.

Risotto was really good, I doubled the parmesan but otherwise cooked it as written.  It was really easy.  My family loved it, there were no leftovers.  My step son, who is not a big rice fan, is already asking when I'll make it again.

Made to order with exception to using pancetta bacon.  turned out slightly salty but I'm sure this was due to the pancetta.  Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Easy to follow, turned out great! Kids ages 1-6 enjoyed/ loved this as well as me and my husband! I followed recipe exactly. I found that it was about 5 minutes per addition of broth for me. Quantity was perfect, as a side for 2 adults and 3 small kids, we had leftovers for another night. Or two. This will be added to the dinner rotation for sure, can't wait to make it again!

Basically easy and delicious. I added chopped mushrooms while cooking the rice. That was my only change. Family loved it!  I paired it with Pecan Crusted Salmon from this site. Super great dinner pairing.

This is the great and easy recipe to make creamy risotto! I made some changes since I was just using ingredients from my fridges. Sausages and asparagus instead of bacon. I used brown rice which requires more broth and stirring. I used beef, and vegetables broth instead of chicken stock. Also I added some cream and cream cheese. It took almost 40~50 minutes and a lot of stirring since I used brown rice. But Brown rice is the healthier alternative. It was absolutely creamy and tasty. My husband loved it.

I selected this recipe because bacon is one of my favorite foods, and I was told risotto is the best kind of rice. I loved how the salty bacon really complimented the creamy risotto. My family loved it when I made it for them. The next night my mom made it again. Use low sodium chicken stock because the bacon makes it salty enough.

This was great. I also used wine as a like it in my risotto. Added leftover thinly sliced grilled chicken as well to make it a meal with more protein. It was excellent!  Served with grilled zucchini. Will definitely make again.

Yum! As with most things, I increased the amount of garlic, parmesan, and bacon. I didn't have any onions, but the rest made up for it just fine. I also ran out of butter, so I gave a splash of milk at the end. Super creamy, super good.

Was unsure whether to try a bacon or a mushroom for my first attempt at a risotto so ended up combining them.  First time I'd ever made it, first time I'd ever eaten it and both myself and my husband deemed it a success.

Will do again.

So good!!  First timer with risotto...always assumed it would be too difficult for me to get right.  Not so, turned out delicious!  My pan was not deep enough though and it does need a lot of attention.  I used the bacon grease instead of some of the butter, and didn't really measure the onions or garlic, but it was awesome!  I made it for me to eat over several days, as I had just had dental surgery and was limited on choices.  It was ALL gone within an hour thanks to 4 other members of my family that loved it:-/. This will be a keeper for my family.  Is it safe to double this kind of recipe given that I have a large enough pan?

The whole family really enjoyed it.  The modifications that I made, however:  1 cup of white wine, in substitute for 1 cup chicken stock; Romano cheese instead of parmesan (all I had); added a few thyme sprigs along with the aborio rice.  Use your own judgement on cooking time, as it will vary.  Wait until it's nice and tender!

I made it with some of the suggestions in the comments as well.  My first time making risotto and it turned out great!  I sautéed the onions and garlic in the bacon grease, then I added about a 1/8 cup of wine wine just before I added the parmesan and bacon.  I made the full serving size even though there was just 2 of us and there ended up being only about a cup leftover with this as our main course.

Bacon Risotto is amazing! Although I "altered" the recipe but I loved it nevertheless, I took out the chicken stock because I can't find it in the grocery and it's too hassle if I made one. I also did not use Arborio Rice, I just used the normal one.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I did add about 6 1/2 cups of broth.  Didn't feel it was creamy enough with just the 5 cups of stock that it asked for.  I also cooked my bacon in the oven (less mess that way) and not as time consuming as cooking it in a pan. I will definitely be making this again!  My family devoured it! Happy cooking everyone!

So yummy!  Made it for our anniversary and making it again tonight for my mom.  Didn't do anything different other than adding a little water to the stock because I'm cheap and didn't want to buy another box of it. :-) It still was great!

Great recipe! I've made it a couple times. I too made slight changes. Instead of using butter I used some of the drippings from the bacon to cook the onion and garlic. I then used more drippings at the end when mixing in the Parmesan. I think it gives more flavor to the dish. I also used uncured bacon without nitrates. Less salty. I love bacon and it's easy to add to almost everything.

Made this as written with my own chicken broth and it was really delicious. I'm going to try it with some mushrooms added next time and see if it's as good as I'm thinking. Thanks for the recipe FURFNSLO!Oops, I forgot to add that it's more like 6-8 servings for the two of us. We had a lot of leftovers.

This recipe is wonderful.  I love risotto and this is one of my favorites.  The bacon/stock can make it a bit salty so be cautious adding any.  I use vegetable stock and usually toss in some frozen peas at the end and they are a great addition.  I have also been short on garlic on occasion and it is good without it too.

This was AWESOME! Yes, we made some small tweaks, but like others, as a decent kitchen cook, I always make small changes according to taste. In this case, I saved the bacon grease and cooked the onion and garlic in that instead of butter, added some white wine with the chicken stock, added some garlic salt, and a tablespoon of truffle oil along with one tablespoon of butter. This was my first time making risotto and I'm SO pleased with how it turned out. My husband was amazed at how good it was, too. It's going into the rotation for sure!

Hell's Kitchen may intimidate the risotto cook, but watch this video, have patience, and you will be PLEASANTLY surprised at the flavor and results. Earned top marks in my kitchen.  Can see by adding any of the suggestions by other cooks, could only enhance this fabulous dish!!  I did not add the egg yolk, and it still was satisfying!

I've made this a couple of times for guests and myself and it is fantastic! What's fun is that you can substitute parmesan for other kinds of cheese to vary the flavor and it works very well also. Great recipe, easy to follow instructions and makes a superb side-dish!

I made this first exactly as written and it was way, way too salty.  But I wanted to give it another try since it seemed like a decent, although flawed, recipe.  The second time, I used half of the bacon and it was delicious.  With half of the bacon, this is a five star recipe.

This, in essance, has been our family's Thanksgiving "rice stuffing" for generations.  The only thing we do differently is that we use a sticky white rice instead of arborio and we add an egg into the hot rice to bind everything together.  It's best when stuffed in the turkey.  The drippings give it a wonderful flavor. Can't wait to have this next week.  Happy Thanksgiving!!

This risotto was SO delicious. My guy thought it was a little heavy on the onion, but I thought it was perfect. I also used less bacon, because I didn't have enough. Next time I will use the full amount.

I made it this chilly fall evening with the Prosciutto.  I liked the suggestion of topping each serving with a poached egg. I also used cilantro instead of fresh parsley.  It was absolutely the best.

Fabulous! Just got back from a visit to Italy and was looking for recipes similar to the food we had in Northern Italy. This is soooo good. I also added 1/4 white wine when cooking the onions and garlic. Also added 1/2 cup frozen peas at the end and sprinkled freshly grated parmesan on top. Nummy!!

I have never made risotto before but this came out excellent...had good reviews from the family...didn't know for sure when it reached "tender but firm" so just went with a texture that seemed to suit us...great flavorful recipe.  Thank you

This was very good.  We didn't have any Parmesan cheese so we used Asiago.  We had this for dinner last night with a salad.  We'll make this again.

Great basic recipe!  I added some peas & sautéed mushrooms.  Next time I may add a few grated carrots for color & to add veggies.  I love to read the changes other people make to recipes.  Thanks everyone for your great ideas!

I'll make this recipe again. It took me longer than 45 minutes but I'm including the time to gather ingredients and chop the onion. I added 1/4 cup of white wine like one of the reviews suggested, but I also added 1/2 cup of peas at the end and it is OUTSTANDING.

Just made this for dinner!!! I too used pancetta and added some asparagus tips. My cheese was parmesan regianno. So good! Will use this recipe many times. Will change up additions to it. But basically it is very good.

This really is a treat.  My husband and I are bacon fanatics and we were looking for something different to eat for dinner.  Since neither of us have made a homemade risotto, we thought that this would be the perfect thing to try.  We were not disappointed.  This is definitely a keeper for our family!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I cook it regularly without bacon as that is not something I keep in my house.  I use 1 cup of white wine in place of one cup of water.  I could eat the whole batch myself it's that good!
Thank you for sharing!

Second time to make risotto -- first time to make it right.
Flavorful, and felt foolproof, even for me!

So creamy and tasty. Only difference was that I used brown rice and it still turned out wonderful. I'd halve it in the future, as I was only cooking for myself and this made a HUGE amount! (Good for leftovers though!)

Amazing. Best risotto recipe I've had. Flavor is off-the-charts. Note that any recipe starting with half a pound of bacon is going to be very rich. I've found that 4 cups of chicken stock is perfect for the 1.5 cups of arborio rice.

Mmm-mmm. This is so delicious. Did it exactly like the recipe calls for except added a little more Parmesan.  Served with pork tenderloin and broccoli, but really could have eaten it all by itself!

Awesome. Took 20 min or so to absorb all the broth but was worth the wait. I used chicken broth not stock.

The description said to put a "raw" egg yolk on the risotto when served, however, I elected to fry my egg in the bacon grease then plopped it on top and is was delicious! 

Highly recommend this recipe.

Family LOVED it!  Used the bacon grease in the beginning instead of butter.  This was my first time making risotto.  Yes - it really does absorb 5 cups of stock and take nearly a half an hour!

use no salt added chicken stock, or it will turn out too salty.

Delicious!  I used pancetta (about 5 ounces) instead of bacon, and threw in a handful of chopped mushrooms.  It was a great one dish wonder that will definitely show up on the menu again!
