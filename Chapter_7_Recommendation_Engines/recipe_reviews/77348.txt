I can't believe I am saying such a thing, but this was reeeeealllllly sweet.  It definitely needs the Cool-Whip type topping on top to balance out the super-sweet chocolate body.  Easy, though, and my kids thought it was a great treat.

This is wonderful chocolate pie! It's fairly simple but so much better than using plain ol' chocolate pudding pie filling.

I think the picture was a bit decieving, but overall, it was an excellent pie.  I thought it would be more of a pudding pie, but when I made it I realized it was a mousse pie.  Still, using a prebaked oreo crust, it was definitly an excellent chocolate mousse pie.  Good job.

This pie was amazing! Very rich and creamy! I used an oreo cookie crust and topped with a container of cool whip. I served this at Thanksgiving with the in-laws and everyone loved it! Obviously, because this recipe contains a can of sweetened condensed milk it's going to be sweet, but I did not think it was too sweet. Make sure to temper the eggs yolks before adding to the chocolate mixture or else they'll curdle.

I loved it!  My hubby said it was a little bit too rich for him, but he's not a woman so his opinion on chocolate doesn't count ;)
