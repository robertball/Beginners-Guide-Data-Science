I was looking for the "Hard Crack" icing recipe my mom used to make. When she passed away I didn't find her "secret" recipe note book. This is the PERFECT icing for apple pockets, pies & soft cookies.

It was really awesome but it is really thick but delicious. But don't add too much salt maybe just a pinch.
