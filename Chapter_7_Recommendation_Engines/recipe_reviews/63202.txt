The salsa was really good.  The combination of flavors made for a tasty complement to the ham.  There was some leftover salsa which we had with chicken the next night.  It tasted even better after having sat in the fridge for a day.

So easy to make and very tasty. The salsa was a good departure from the usual pineapple side with ham.

I was skeptical, at first, about this salsa because a) I don't like to eat fruit with meat, and b) salsa with meat is just plain weird.  However, I love ham steaks and wanted to give this a whirl to shake things up. I'M SO GLAD I DID!  I used one small can of crushed pineapple, finely chopped the green onion, and didn't use the lemon zest or the cloves. The red pepper+green onion and pineapple are just divine together. I will make this again, and it's perfect for summer!

I thought this was a little odd.  I added more hot sauce to my salsa on my plate and it was better. Hubby didn't like it at all.
