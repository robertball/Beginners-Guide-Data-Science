This recipe is so good, my whole family loved it. My dad wanted me to make more, so he could take it to work the next day. since he is on a diet, i used non-fat plain yogurt instead of mayo and he didnt even know the differnace. using the yogurt instead of the mayo cut out a lot of the fat, and not a lot of the taste. will continue to make this recipe with yogurt.

I have made a version of this for years. I thought this one might be a different and delicious change. Not so...  This was way too peppery, too much cheese and the red wine vinegar(and the lemon juice) made it almost bitter.

Had to review this again since I've made it at least 6 to 8 times this summer. It was fabulous the 1st time I made it and has become a favorite.  I don't measure ingredients any longer and I vary them with what I have on hand. Plumped raisins and sunflower seeds make it extra good, but it's great without.It's a wonderful make-ahead dish and left-overs keep nicely. I always double the dressing using Splenda, red wine or cider vinegar, and light mayo.THE BEST! deserves 6 stars!

I love this salad!  I use one head of cauliflower and one head of broccoli and the combination is remarkable.  Great for pot-lucks.

I used a yellow onion as that is what  I had and it worked fine.  I think the cheddar cheese is a must.  I would recommend chopping the broccoli rather small in order to incorporate the dressing for best flavor.  Very good recipe.

Loved this dish. It's very pretty and easy to build and delicious. Couple of suggestions especially with some of the negative comments from other reviews in mind. 1st, cook the broccoli, it not only tenderizes it, it changes the flavor…I used steamed leftover broccoli and my wife and teen son loved it. You can choose the level of al dente to be satisfied with. Use the red onion but cook it just enough to knock down the “brightness” of the onion flavor. Use a dry, non-stick pan, and just cook it enough to dry it out a bit…don’t cook so much you start to change the color, and let it keep most of it’s crunchy texture. A word about the “bitter” flavor some reviewers ran into. There wasn’t a hint of it in our dish. Is it possible that these folks were using pre-squeezed products? If so, have to recommend against it. Bitterness is most likely from seeds or from product that’s turned in the fridge. But, really, just created the recipe as written…including the sugar, and loved it. Good this next day, too.

The salad was very good and I will definitely make again. I did not use the recommended amount of pepper after reading the other reviews. I used about 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper.

It was great!  I bought fresh broccoli floweretts at the bulk food store and chopped them.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar to use in our low-carb diet.  My husband really loved it

The salad is served with raw brocolli, as one reader asked. I have made the recipe with the following. 2 bunches broccoli, 8 slices of fried bacon, 3/4 cup cheddar or swiss cheese - grated, 1 thinly slice red or white onion. Toss together. For the dressing: 1 cup mayo (no miracle whip) 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons white vinegar. Pour over broccoli mixture before eating or ahead of time, the longer it sets, the better tasting.(I have doubled the dressing mixture, we like a saucy texture to this salad.  This broccoli salad has been around for a while, but once you make it, you always come back for the recipe. (bacon bits can be substituted for the bacon, although better tasting with fried bacon).

Super easy salad!  I used a package of real bacon bits instead of frying up some bacon.  Left all the other measurements the same.  Loved the dressing this made, I didn't find anything to overpower another.  I did, however, mix this up in the evening and let it sit over night.  I think that probably helped the flavors to really come together.

This is a delicious salad.  A great way to enjoy broccoli.  I used real bacon bits from the jar and used 3 broccoli crowns.  I also added roasted sunflower kernels and raisins for texture and crunch. I used fat free grated cheddar cheese. I am going to take this to a ladies' Christmas lunch because it is so good. Thanks for the great recipe.

I've been making this for several years now, and have made a small change.  Instead of the red wine vinegar and lemon juice, I substitute balsamic vinegar, and no lemon juice.  Add 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat for even more flavor!

Made this last night with French Dip sandwiches.  To die for.  Boyfriend asked me to make more today, so I did this morning.  I did as others had indicated and increased the amount of mayo to make it a bit creamier.  I also increased the amounts a little bit as it didn't seem like enough dressing.  We loved it.  Will definitely make again (I already have and it's only the next day!).  Oh, and use 1/2 the pepper!  Okay, I'm updating this review two days after originally posting.  Boyfriend wants me to make it AGAIN (I've already made it twice two days in a row!).  You've got to try it!  I've got to go buy some more broccoli...

Too peppery and a bit bitter from the one we're used to. Also, the second day, the flavors hadn't melded more, just more bitter.

I added cauliflower to this recipe as well. I took it to an event at our church, I got many compliments on it, and when I was walking by one of the tables I heard one guy say, "whoever made this brocolli salad rocks!" Will definately make this salad again, but may leave out some of the onion next time, It was slightly overpowering for me, althoug everyone else seemed to like it.

When my wife asked me what I was making, I told her, Broccoli Salad. She made a disgusted face. "Sounds terrible." I took a spoonful, stuck it in her maw and watched her expression change.

"Take me now."

I made this twice this weekend and I strongly recommend adding  about HALF the black pepper first, taste it, then add more if needed. My first batch was VERY peppery. The second one turned out better. I liked it.

This is very good, someone brought a similar salad to work and it was good but the broccoli was too crunchy (hard)a complaint I heard by a few others. When I found this recipe I very lightly blanched then chilled my broccoli. I also used only a tsp. of pepper....yummy good stuff!

We had guests for dinner who are doing a loose version of the South Beach Diet (low carbs).  I made this using a sugar substitute and light mayo in the dressing and it turned out just fine.

This is to die for!  I cooked the bacon in the microwave to get it super crunchy, and had to eliminate the lemon juice because I was out of it.  Didn't matter.....it was delicious.  Will be making it again this weekend for a bbq.  Can hardly wait!

I have been making this amazing salad for years and it is always a favorite at family gatherings. Instead of two heads of broccoli, I started using one head each of broccoli and cauliflower, and it is delicious! Bear in mind that this dish is best after it has been refrigerated for a few hours. The dressing needs time to settle in, and permeate through the broccoli (and cauliflower in my case). It always tastes just slightly off when you eat it immediately.

This was great! My boyfriend wasn't sure about eating raw broccoli when I told him about the recipe but in the end he devoured it and almost licked the plate clean. Tasty sauce and we loved the cheese and bacon in there. I used white wine vinegar and doubled the dressing to coat evenly. I chopped and crisped just one chicken breast and topped the salad with it - made a great, healthy feeling meal. Thanks.

We all devoured this salad, even the kids! Very easy, and a delicious blend of ingredients. I, too, quickly blanched the broccoli as I find raw broccoli just too crunchy. Blanching it brought out the flavour in the broccoli while maintaining the crunchy texture for the salad. This will be made many times over! Thanks so much for sharing it!

Good dish. Others complained it was too tangy and tart. I found it to be fine. We did adjust the recipe by doubling the dressing. We all agreed that it was better once we doublled the recipe and allowed it to marniade.

This was a great recipe! We were looking for a non-traditional salad and this will defiantly be a staple in our house. The only thing I would change is adding only 1/3 red onion. :)

This was OK--WAAAYYY too much pepper with 2 tsp!  I only used one and that was over the top pepper-y.  I did not read other reviews, just had my son read it to me as I was making it =-)  Double checked with him 3 times with that amount and he finally said that I could just do what I wanted!  It seems like there is way too much cheese in here too-- guess this one isn't my favorite form.  (I did add some raisins to try to combat the pepper--not a complete fix but I do like raisins in my broccoli salad)

The red wine vinegar and lemon juice made the dressing far too bitter. I tried adding some raisins and more sugar but the recipe was a flop.  I've asked my friend for her broccoli salad recipe- I KNOW hers is good!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I did make some alterations though.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and 1/2 cup mayo instead of 2/3, and 1/8 cup red wine vinegar instead of 1/4.

I've been making this since 2003, and the only change is that I leave out the onions. I've gotten many requests for the recipe over the years, and it's my go-to when asked to bring a dish, summer, winter, spring, and fall! Some reviewers have complained that it's too peppery, but that's personal preference. Try it! You'll become addicted!

This was a great salad dish for our Thanksgiving.  I did blanch the broccoli and used a bit less salt and pepper and it was just great!  The kids liked it too.  My only mistake was not making more.

I got one word-BIZARRE! I think it would be good without the pepper. I even used half of the recommended amount and it really tasted funny. My husband said he wanted to like it but then you just get this weird taste in your mouth. The pepper throws everything off. Word of caution-make the dressing without the pepper than take a teaspoon out and try it with the pepper to see if you like it before ruining the whole dish. I wish I would of done this!

This is an absolute FAVORITE! I have been making this recipe for a year now and continue to expand the list of fans across the country. We find this to be a satisfying lunch unto itself.  The only modification I make is to add somewhat less sugar than called for here. Be sure to use SHARP cheese. Yellow cheese as opposed to white, adds to the visual appeal.

I would have enjoyed this more with less of the red onion.  I didn't even use a half of one as the recipe calls for, & it was still too much for my taste.  I will make this again, but with much less red onion.

A co-worker brought a version of this recipe to a pot luck one time and I loved it. Served it to a bunch of teenagers a few weeks ago and they actually loved it too. Some of them came back for seconds. I added fresh red grapes to my recipe and I think the spices (pepper/salt) you add to taste.

This was really yummy!  For me a little too runny.  I added Craisins and thought about adding sunflower seeds may next time!  Great "new" salad to introduce to the boring old traditions!  I recommend making this for your next gathering.

I served this on 25 Nov 2010 - Thanksgiving Day and received rave reviews and someone wanted the recipe.  This recipe is so delicious.  The red wine vinegar is the key ingredient.  Also, I never use mayonnaise on anything.  I always use Miracle Whip instead.

This recipe is awesome....or better put, BODACIOUS!!!  I love this. My hubby and I ate the whole thing in one evening. The only things I did different were I used white wine vinegar instead or red wine vinegar because I didn't have any on hand.  I also didn't have onions on hand so I omitted them and added extra cheese and bacon.  Hey! You can NEVER have too much cheese and bacon.  Also Iadded some of those cherry flavored dried cranberries (Craisins).  Sooooo goood!  You've gotta try this recipe!

This salad was GREAT! I made it as stated (Except a little less cheese and mayo) and it was fabulous...I took it to the park for my sons birthday party. I would recommend eating it as soon as the bacon is crumbled in it because if you leave it in the refrigerator overnight (as I did because I made a few other salads), the bacon is soggy and it takes away from the fabulousness of the salad. I also put craisens in the leftover salad and loved it.

Always a hit.  I use a little less cheese and add craisins.  Also, right before serving, add some chopped cashews.  Yum!  Everyone loves it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I went with this recipe for a baby shower because it was tried and true by so many reviewers. I now know why! I doubled the recipe and used Apple Cider Vinegar because that is all I had on hand. (I'm sure this altered the taste as intended but it was still good.) I used half of the pepper called for (w/out doubling). It looks like there might not be enough dressing but it works out perfectly. I made it the night before and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe - it is now my staple broccoli salad.

Amazing!  Great flavor and loved the combination of broccoli, bacon and cheese.  I cheated and used 2 bags of pre-washed broccoli from the grocery store, and crisped up a bag of Oscar Mayer recipe-sized bacon bits in the microwave.  Per other reviewers I did cut the pepper back to 1 teaspoon but that was the only modification.  Simply delicious just as written!!

This is terrific!  I wasn't sure how fine to chop the broccoli...I ended up chopping it into marble-sized bits and I thought that was probably about perfect for this recipe.  Delicious!!

This is such a great recipe and it keeps so well!  I think it tastes even better when it sits in the fridge a day or two. To cut down on the fat, I've omitted the cheese, used fat free mayo, and added a bunch of red or green grapes to the salad.  This salad was a hit at the office potluck!

WOW WOW WOW!!!!!! This is the best salad I have ever had!  I too cut the pepper amount down to 1 tsp, but otherwise, it was perfect.  My 4 year old downed a ton of it!   This will be one of our new favorites!  I'll be making it for our Labor Day Cookout today!!!!

I'm not lying when I say this stuff is like candy for me, I keep saying that I'm just going to make this recipe and not eat so much, and I end up wanting to down the whole thing.  I cut back on the vinegar (one cap full) and add 3/4 cup of sugar to my dressing, also I completely omit lemon juice.  No one who tries this doesn't like it.

Absolutely delicious!  I put the dressing ingredients in my food processor and it blended very well. I might add sunflower seeds  next time. Will definitely make this again! I wonder how long it keeps in the refrigerator before it gets soggy?

My mom makes a broccoli salad similar to this one.She adds raisins or grapes,sunflower seeds,and honey.She does not add the sugar,pepper,bacon or lemon juice.This is the kind of recipe you can add or remove one or more of the ingredients to fit your personal preference,but I enjoyed this one as it is.By far, hands down, one of my favorites.

I like this recipe a lot! I hate red wine vinegar and just used white vinegar and it was fine. I also reduced the sugar a little bit because the first time I found it too sweet, but otherwise this is great!

I soaked the chopped red onion in water for about 20 mins while chopping the broccoli and followed the rest as directed (except used a sqeeze-lemon instead of fresh).  Let it sit in the fridge for 2-3 hours.  Oh, used bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  Family loved it.

This recipe is wonderful. I've made it a few times and found I need to add a little more sugar (my taste preference). I've also added either sunflower seeds or slivered almonds for a little extra crunch. Also added a combination of golden raisins, regular raisins and dried cranberries. Everyone that has tasted it has fallen in love with it. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe looks fantastic! I look forward to making it. I have made a similar dish, one that I discovered at a church pot-luck. Just mix together fresh broccoli flowerets, sunflower seeds (the more, the better), and honey mustard dressing. Dee-lish!

Unreal - I had my reservations but this is awesome (and it hasn't even chilled yet)!  I halved the salt & pepper based on other reviews, and left out the lemon juice because I generally hate it.  I will try this dressing on other veggie salads - Those who reviewed suggesting you carry the recipe with you when serving it were right on - VERY good!

If you double this recipe DO NOT double the pepper.  Yikes.  I would cut the pepper in half for single recipe, also. I added raisins and it was terrific.

One important addition that makes this salad better: 1/3c of salted, shelled sunflower seeds!  Plus, I cheat and use pre-cooked real bacon pieces that you find by the salad stuff, AND instead of grated cheese, I use sharp cheddar "crumbles".  So amazing!!

I steamed the broccoli for just a minute to bring out the bright green.  I added plumped dried cranberries and raisins, and shredded carrots.  Used green onions and less cheese.  Might try diced ham rather than bacon next time.  Very versatile and the raisins and carrots gave it great color!

We loved this broccoli salad after some modifications. The pepper was excessive and overpowering, I would suggest 1/2 to 1 tsp.  Also, I found that 1/4 c. of wine vinegar was a bit strong.  I used between 1/8 and 1/4 c.  This is also nice with about 1/8 c. of sunflower seeds added.  My family requests I make this at every family function!

I used 3 small heads of broccoli.I mixed two batches of the dressing for trial and error reasons.The first batch was mixed as instructed using apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and is was horriable to my dismay.Way to much vinegar and with the lemon it was way too much bitter.The second dressing batch was perfect.I used 1 cup mayo(I mixed miracle whip light and an organic soy mayo together),2 tablespoons of white vinegar,NO lemon and 2 table spoons of sugar.I used only a dash of salt and pepper and a dash of onion powder since I dont like whole onions.I also shredded a little bit of carrots and mozz cheese for some kick.

WAY too sour with the Vinegar.
If you substitute the orange juice for the vinegar, and use craisins instead of raisins.. this is terrific

Amazing! Until now, I have only enjoyed this salad at a local Sonny's salad bar, and am impressed with how similar the taste is to that recipe. I love the real bacon (the one at the restaurant has bac'o bits), but I waited to put the cheese in until after it has chilled, to avoid mushiness. I say it's a hit, but I'll have to see what the hubby says...

This is a great salad.  I brough it for a church picnic and the 4th of July celebration with friends. I did make a few alterations and they were sucessful.  First...I used turkey bacon (fried in olive oil) and not regular bacon.  Many people that had not had turkey bacon couldn't tell the difference!  Also I used walnuts (because that is what I had) and toasted them.  Lastly, I can not have sugar...so I used Splenda and it worked perfectly.  VERY Good!  Truely, my salad was the first to go and no-one could believe it was sugar free and low fat!

I thought this recipe was great. I used light mayo, low-fat cheese, and Spenda to make it more WeightWatcher's-friendly. Total points per serving is 3. Worth every bite. I've had this recipe with raisins and they add a nice texture as well. Thanks, Cassandra!

We loved it, but thought there was just a bit too much pepper in this recipe.
The next time I'll just cut it back a little. Other than that, it was excellent. I added white grapes and toasted almonds.

almost perfect. Our family thought there was a tad too much pepper. Also, adding rasins and sunflower seeds was a big plus.

My son's friend's parents have been serving this salad in their homestyle Texas diner for years, but I just heard about it.  Wonderful mix of sweet and tangy.  I sweat out the onion in a little of the bacon grease, and then mixed the rest of the dressing ingredients in the pan to dissolve the sugar well.  Also subbed low fat yogurt for half the mayo.  New staple for us for potlucks and picnics.

I made this for the first time last night and it was awesome! Me and my fiance' both loved it.  With him being diabetic, I'm always looking for low carb recipes.  I substituted the regular sugar with whey-low (a new all natural sugar substitute which is better tasting and better for you then Splenda).  He couldn't stop eating it.  Needless to say, I'm making another batch tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!

Have used a "standard" recipe for this for a few years, always "tweaking" it to suit our tastes... This is the first I have found has our major pepper added!! Made it again today, using this recipe with only minor tweaks: 3 crowns broccoli, blanched for color and chopped fine; 2T lemon juice; grated 1/4 onion and sliced the rest super thin... Yummy! Thanks, Cassandra!

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I left out the lemon juice as one reviewer had mentioned.  It turned out delicious.  I purchased 2 bunches of broccoli, but only used one.  It was just right for the amount of dressing this made.  I wish I'd doubled the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this lovely salad, Cassandra!

I used this recipe as a guide, but I made a lot of changes for my own convenience. I used lightly steamed broccoli, had to substitute the red wine vinegar with white wine vinegar, added smoked pancetta instead of bacon, and grated swiss cheese instead of cheddar. I also guessed the measurements of the dressing ingredients, probably using a bit less of everything. I definitely used less cheese in the salad. Delicious! I like the idea, and I like the ability to play around with the recipe. Thanks!

I liked how peppery the dressing was (although it seemed a little too thin); I bet it'd be a great cole slaw dressing, too.

my first review of the salad was bad. However I had to come back and leave another one. I made my old recipe and found myself missing the tang of this salad. This time I didn't add as much pepper only 1 teaspoon and it's much better. Also not as much lemon juice in the salad is really good.

The bodacious broccoli salad received many compliments, even from non-broccoli eaters, though I did change the recipe up.  I blanched the broccoli for about 3-4 minutes and let cool in the freezer. Meanwhile, I mixed the dressing, eliminating half the pepper and salt to let the brightness of the red wine vinegar come through, and increasing the mayo by a few tablespoons for more creaminess. Then mixed everything in the serving bowl. It came together very quickly and easily. Definitely make this!

Very good, however, after following the recipe exactly I thought it was too peppery.  And I really love pepper too.   So I mixed about 1/3 C of more mayo with about 1 T of more lemon juice and 1 T of more red wine vinegar, then added it to the salad and it seemed to help lessen the peppery flavor a bit. Will definitely keep making this recipe, but with only 1/2 the pepper called for.

While this is good I may tweak it a bit. I did substitute sour cream for the mayo. A friend suggest giving the onions a quick sautee with the bacon and reducing the vinegar. Aside from that it was delicious and will be returning to the table.

I would definitely cut the amount of pepper in half.  I made it using the 2 teaspoons of pepper, but our whole family felt that all they tasted was the pepper.

This was so delicious, we brought it to a family get together and it was a hit, everybody went back for seconds.  I did switch it up a little.  I left out the bacon, used Vegenaise mayo, added sunflower seeds and golden raisins.  So tasty!  I can't wait until I make it again and it is very easy to put together.

One of my favorite recipes. I just made this for a scouting event and thought I would be able to bring leftovers home. Wrong! It was devoured and I had two people ask for the recipe. It was easy for them to remember the name 'bodacious broccoli salad'. Some tweaks to make it perfect: 1) use less onion. I love red onion but a 1/2 onion would be enough. 2) go light on the red cider vinegar. Definitely taste the dressing as you make it to be sure it has the right amount of tang or sweetness for you. 3) adding a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries was perfect in this. I can't wait to make this again. I may try sunflower seeds next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good.  I halved the recipe & it seemed like there wasn't quite enough dressing but it was probably just due to the large head of broccoli I used.  I'm interested to see how it tastes the day after.

Yummy, but there wasn't enough dressing to coat the broccoli thoroughly.  My husband complained that he felt like he was eating raw broccoli.  Therefore, I think I'll double the dressing next time I make it.

I just made this.  The only changes I made was I did the salt and pepper to taste, because I  knew it would be to much for my family and used white vinegar instead of  red wine , because that is what I had on hand no lemon juice. I was really impressed with this salad, love the flavors, the tang of the vinegar and the pepper. Can't wait to make for a family gathering.

Great recipe! I had to make a small change. I mixed the mayo, S&P, vinegar and sugar and then taste tested it. It was very puckery! So I never added the lemon juice and I had to add more sugar - basically doubled it. Other than that, I was great.

I made this salad hoping for something closer to a similar salad a friend makes, but this was too salty and a little bit too peppery for most people.  Interestingly, my friend's salad is made with plain vinegar and no salt and pepper.  It's a sweeter salad but it is delicious!

This recipe is great.  So versatile. I have added sunflower seeds and halved purple grapes for a twist.  I also use applewood smoked bacon.  It really adds to the flavor of the dish.

I have always loved this recipe!   I made as is - but, I used about 1 cup of mayonnaise.  I also used one of the bags of fresh cut broccoli florets in the produce department because I was short on time - I don't think it was equal to (2) whole heads of broccoli, but, it was the perfect amount for the recipe.  I also added about 1/2 cup of raisins.

This was delicious as is but I'd definitely make again and use suggestions by other reviewers. Broccoli stays crunchy even the next day, so you can make it ahead of time and it's fine.

The cheese and bacon give this great texture and flavor.  The vinegar flavor is a touch too strong for my taste, but it's not like other recipes that are swimming in it.

I have a bunch of broccoli in the garden to use up so I thought I would try this. A bit too much vinegar for my taste. But it definately needs to be made in advance. Tastes much better the next day. I also added sunflower seeds.

Love, love, love this salad!  I also used the broccoli/cauliflower combination and also threw in some frozen peas that I defrosted.  I used green onions instead of red, because that's what I had on-hand.  Next time I will definitely try the red onion.  I really liked the lemon juice.  It gave it a nice kick in my opinion.  This salad is really good, but it's even better the next day after it's marinated a little bit.  YUM!

I omitted the sugar and salt, but kept everything else the same. (We're not big on sweet, mayonnaise-y salads and the salad would be salty enough with the bacon, cheese and mayo.) When I served it for lunch, I sprinkled chow mein noodles over the top. We all loved this. The red wine vinegar really made a typical broccoli salad better. My oldest son had two big helpings! Very good. This one's a keeper.

Mmm Mmm...delicious!!  Changed a few things though to make it perfect.  Used rice vinegar instead of red wine and more sugar.  Thats pretty much all the changes that it needs.  Very good!

AWESOME!! LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! I've had this broccoli salad at a few get-togethers before and was so impressed. Anyway, sort the ratings by most helpful and use the suggestions by the most helpful rating. It's GREAT! Except...I used fancy shredded cheese, and I think it's great. Also, I used YOGURT instead of MAYO! (with a couple tablespoons of miracle whip for flavor). GREAT GREAT GREAT!!! THANKS!

I've made this recipe 5 times for 5 different groups of people and it was a hit every time.  I really recommend letting it refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours to let the flavors fully mix and to allow the brocolli to soften a bit....it's always a hit.

This is a great salad.  Today though I sauted the onion with the bacon and used rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  Wow! A simple, great tasting variation with a more smooth flavor.

I made this exactly per the recipe for a family gathering. None of us are picky eaters.  We all love broccoli so I thought it would be a hit.  This was just a disaster.  Not one person liked it.  WAY  too much vinegar and pepper!!! Needs raisins or cranberries or something to tone down the sour taste.  Too many different flavors and it got worse as it aged for an hour in the refrig.  Will not make it again.

This was good.  My family doesn't like onions, so I left those out, added some glazed slized almonds, and used rice vinegar instead of the wine vinegar.

This was great.  I made it with an entire bottle of "Bac'n" salad toppings instead of the bacon and it was still great, (not to mention easier).  Even my three year old liked it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last week for a neighborhood barbeque and it got rave reviews!  I use low fat shredded cheddar and low fat mayo to make it healthier.  I used 2x as much broccoli and the just a bit more generous on the dressing - not doubled about a third more.  I also added craisins and walnuts.  It will be a staple to my summer dining!

I think if I had followed the recipe a little more carefully it would have been "bodacious."  I didn't put it in all the bacon, and somehow ended up with way too much onion.  The onion flavor kind of killed the whole dish.  If I make it again I will definitely cut that back and add more bacon.

LOVE!  This is so good.  I make a couple changes when I prepare this: I make  about 50% more dressing and add raisins.  I've also used Splenda instead of sugar.  Excellent with the BBQ Pork Sandwiches on rolls and Oven Potato Wedges (both from this site).

This is the best recipe for broccoli salad I have tried. I only changed the recipe slightly. I added chopped walnuts and, when I have it, use 1/3 cauliflower and 2/3 broccoli.

I can't give it 5 stars b/c while it was definitely deemed bodacious by my guests, I made some changes to the dressing.  Instead of mayo, I used sour cream and added some dijon mustard.  I added dried blueberries to the salad.  Instead of bacon, I pan fried some proscuitto, which was REALLY delicious!  This salad was cleaned up at my 4th of July bbq.

I love this recipe.  It is very easy because I buy the already shredded cheese and already crumbled bacon so I just throw it all together.  I bring it to potlucks and it is a big hit.  I think I am going to have to make some tonight!

I skipped the bacon and substituted lower fat/sugar free ingredients like light mayo and Splenda to make this dish more artery-friendly.  I also added Craisins and sesame seeds - a pleasant surprise.  It was a huge hit.  Let the salad sit for a while to blend the flavors before serving.

I just used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and it came out fine.  Eyeballed the amounts and tasted it to make sure it came out good before mixing it up with the broccoli.  Yummy!

I used bacon bits instead of freshly cooked bacon and it still tasted great.  I got SO many compliments about this salad when I made it for Christmas dinner this year.  It's tangy and just the right amount of sweetness.  One of my favourites.

A four as written, but after tasting it, I added some water chestnuts and sunflower seeds. This gave it a couple more textures and more flavor too. I also think there could be less pepper- maybe half.

Loved this broccoli salad. It is definetly a keeper. My husband thought the onion was a bit overpowering. The recipe calls for a bit too much red onion for my taste as well. Perhaps next time I will add 1/4 instead of 1/2. Overall, it was a great salad. I will modify the onion and make it again.

This is delicious and even better the second day! I'm not typically a raw broccoli fan but I couldn't stop picking at this after our Thanksgiving dinner! I made this the night before so the flavors would blend which they did. Suggestion: If you want the bacon to be crisp, add it just before serving. I put mine in with everything else and while it was great, I would have preferred the crunch.

I never thought there could be to much vinegar in anything... I was wrong.  I made it to take to my in-laws' and am ashamed to show up with it.

I think I prefer this same recipe with raisens in it....and nuts.  The dressing was good. I think there were too many onions for me.

This is a very delicious salad!  Even my husband who dislikes broccoli ate it for 3 days in a row!  I made it exactly following the recipe and didn't change a thing.  I'm sure I will make this over and over again.  Thanks for sharing this great salad.

I printed this recipe over a year ago, with intentions of making it "someday".  Well, "someday" finally arrived, and I'm so glad it did.  Though, I cheated and used Mann's Broccoli Slaw, instead of chopped broccoli (yes, I'm lazy!).  It turned out perfectly.  We had a dinner party with friends and I served this salad, the Summer Potato Salad, Dave's Low Country Boil, Tartar Sauce I, Old-Fashioned Lemonade from this site, my own homemade cocktail sauce, lots of melted butter, french bread and lots of beer.  Then we proceeded to celebrate and immediately fall into a food coma, followed by a movie at the beach.  Summer Perfection!

Made this to a 'T' the first time for a potluck and was not impressed as everyone else here.  Recipe calls for way too much vinegar and not enough dressing.  Second time, I decreased the vinegar by 2-3 tablespoons and increased mayonaise by 2 more tablespoon and turned out much better.  Also increasing bacon to 10-12 slices taste better and adds a smokier flavor.  Use hickory smoked bacon for best results.  And don't let this sit for more than 3 hours before serving or gets soggy and saturated.

I made this last night and wanted to eat it all by myself! Made a couple of changes: Doubled the dressing mixture, added real bacon bits to cut the time in half, and threw about 1/4 C of Salad Toppings on it!  Delish!  *Very important to let it sit overnight for the flavors to meld*

Excellent!  Made this for a 4th of July party, and it was devoured!  My only change was the same as many other reviewers - i cut the pepper back to 1 tsp and it seemed perfect. I will definitely be making this again!  What a great way to eat a veggie that many people don't like prepared in other ways!

The only changes I made was to csutomize this recipe down to 4 servings as it was just hubby & I, used real  bacon bits for fried bacon, decreaed the pepper some (I probably gave it about 10 twists) & I blanched the broccoli. Oh, & I also had to use mild cheddar for the sharp as that's all I had. (Guess I made more changes than I thought, huh?  ;o) )This salad was awesome!!! I loved the smoky flavor the bacon added....wll have this over & over again.

Loved the versatility of this recipe!  Don't worry if you don't have all of the stated ingredients, just use what you have!  I used Feta cheese instead of cheddar, apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and, if you are a diabetic and on a low carb diet like me, substitute Splenda for the sugar!  I didn't have bacon, so I had to go without, I was sad about that though because I LOVE bacon and am sure it would have made it even better!  Great recipe for broccoli, FINALLY I have an alternative to boring old steaming!!! Thanks!

So good. I think I may make a little extra dressing next time, but it keeps well as is (I think I'll be bringing it to work for lunch).  I also used pre-cooked bacon.  Easy and still tasted good.

This salad was really good! I think that I used too much broccoli (I used two large heads) because the dressing (which was DELISH) didn't cover the broccoli all the way. I added 2 cups of cheese. I will try this again using smaller heads of broccoli and more bacon. Thanks!

This was excellent.  The flavor reminded me of cole slaw a little bit. I made it a day ahead and tossed in the cheese just before serving and it was delicious.

I love this salad. This is a great side or just a snack. I made this with light mayo and splenda. I did use bacon bits to save time and didnt use the onion...wont do that again. Being lazy wont pay off on this. Next time I am going to try with blue cheese or fetta and dried cranberries.

I have always loved this salad! Lost my recipe for it, so thanks for posting it! You could use the bacon that's already cooked, but I don't find that as tasteful as preparing it yourself in the stove or in the microwave! Am looking forward to having this at least once a month. (if not more!!!)

For a potluck, I tripled the amt of broccoli, used 1lb of bacon, 1 8 oz pkg shredded cheddar and doubled the dressing.  The proportions worked just fine. One mistake, I added appx 3/4 teasp of pepper (from a canister - not fresh ground) big mistake.. too peppery.   Next time will make the effort to grind. Entire bowl was gobbled up.

This salad is awesome!  I am not a big fan of broccoli (even though I know it's so good for you!) But this recipe will definetly have me getting my share of this veggie!  Simple to make, inexpensive and everyone has loved it.  Thank you Cassandra  =)

This salad is just delicious. It needs no adjustment, it is perfect.Believe me, I usually feel that no recipe should be left un-tinkered with.  Even my son, who is a very picky eater, could not stop eating this.

I made 1/2 this recipe for a small dinner party and it was very well received. I followed the advice of other reviewers; I blanched the broccoli and decreased the amount of black pepper. I also used turkey bacon and 2 packets of Splenda (sugar substitute). This is a great make-ahead, Atkins-friendly dish. I will definitely make it again.

VERY GOOD!
I used a bagged broccoli/ cauliflower blend, turkey bacon, and balsamic vinegar. Refrigeration really is the key- the flavors need to blend. (I also used low fat cheese and low fat mayo and splenda)
Excellent!!

Thsi is AWESOME!!! I made it last night for a picnic I am going to today and while I am at work I am dreaming of it in the fridge, thank goodness or I would eat all of it. I didn't change the recipe at all, except I used pre-cooked bacon and shredded cheese, and it tastes soooo good. I also didn't add so much pepper. The basic recipe is to die for, but to fill it out a bit I added penne pasta (I was told to bring a pasta salad), and I ended up bringing some for my lunch. I don't even care if people at the picnic don't like it because then there will be more for me!!!!!! I will be making this alll summer. Thanks for a definitely bodacious salad. CHEERS!! A.

This is totally awesome!  I have made many broccoli salads, but I find this one to be the crowd pleaser.  I have yet to meet anyone who does not love this.  I have even used this salad as a base for elbow macaroni salad for additional substance.  My family LOVES this!

Delicious!  I made this for a cookout today and it went quickly.  I didn't have an onion so I added a little onion powder instead.  I will definitely make this again.  I may use a little less sugar next time.  I made this dish a few hours early and am glad I did.  It tasted even better right before I served it.

Everybody reviewed this so highly.  So I was surprised when it didn't turn out.  There is WAY too much red vinegar in the recipe.  It overwhelmed the entire dish.  I was wondering if the 1/4 cup was a typo?  We threw out the entire dish.

I made this recipe for a cookout and it was awesome.  I usually have trouble getting my kids to eat broccoli but they loved this.  I think it was the cheese and the bacon that entised them.  I will use this over and over again.

this has become a new favorite of ours.  My daughter is a type 1 diabetic and I'm constantly searching for different recipes I can surprise her with.  The ONLY change I made was to replace the white sugar with organic stevia, and Viola!  Diabetic friendly!   In a pinch, I've also used white wine vinegar  in place of the red and it didn't change the flavor too much.  This is a great low-carb side dish or appetizer, and holds up great for your holiday buffet table!  a bit of ice in a bowl underneath, and you're set for hours!  great recipe, thank you for sharing!

Much too salty. The cheddar cheese and bacon have salt in them and adding 1 tsp of salt is just too much. Wished I had thought about that beforehand. Will make again using only 1/8 to 1/4 tsp salt.

It turned out super I made a double recipe! I prepared  it in the afternoon and gave it a day to marinate in the fridge. The broccoli was just the right crispness without being too hard after marinating. I added raisins and sunflower seed kernals. I substituted Truvia sweetener and 1 doonk of Stevia for the sugar and added a tablespoon of the bacon grease from frying up the bacon and it was cleaned up by everyone on Easter.

Way too peppery!! Would have been good without the overwhelming taste of pepper in the dressing.  2 teaspoons is way too much.  Knock It down to 1 teaspoon and it will improve this tremendously.

Fantastic! My only alteration is apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, because it's what I always have on hand. Everyone always loves it, even with plain old cider vinegar. :)

As an aside, I also splurge on shredded extra sharp cheddar from a local dairy. What's the point of cheese without flavor?  Definitely worth the extra couple bucks.

LOVE this broccoli salad and so does my family. Great flavor and easy to make. I like to let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to soak up the flavors of the  dressing. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  2 teaspoons of pepper is  a bit too peppery for me.

I found the dressing to be too watery. I had to add extra Mayo to thicken it. Other than that, it tasted alright.  Next time, I would cut down on the vinegar.

I have made this salad for a few years now with 1/2 C of raisins, or 1/2 C dried cranberries; both are amazing!!  Today I made it for our Holiday Cookie Party and it was a big hit.  The salad looks great and the taste is even better!  Thank you!

Great tasting salad.  I used to buy mine at a grocery store's salad bar but figured it would be better if I made it fresh. It takes less time than me going to to store and has better flavor. A keeper for my family.

The rating is for as is.  But after reading other reviews I did wait to taste my dressing befor putting it on salad.  All lemons are not created equal, as everyone knows, so I added some extra mayo and it also helped tone down the harshness of the vinegar.  I also used less black pepper.  I will be making this again.  It's wise to taste before adding any kind of dressing, gravy, etc.  I do like this salad very much.  Thank you for contributing it.

Will probably make again because I used lowfat mayo and it didn't taste very good at all. We're eating it because we don't want to waste it but it was requested by my family to toss the recipe.  Didn't seem to have enough dressing and maybe too much broccoli I used 2 heads but the size varies. Maybe if I knew how many cups of chopped broccoli it would be helpful.

This is a wonderful salad and great for all kinds of events. The first time I made it I omitted onion and it was fine. The rest of the times I decreased rhe red vinegar by half (can always add), pepper too and increased the mayo (I lIke my dreswing a tad thicker). I also added a dash of garlic powder. Italians do that! It is fabulous.  You can make ahead by placing dressing and cheese aside until day of party. Then mix together in am or around then. It does need a few hours to absorb the flavors. Thank you for sharing.  It is as close to Ruby Tuesday's on the buffet  as you will get

Excellent! I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and used real bacon bits instead of messing with cooking the bacon, and reduced the sugar to 3 tsp. My husband is not a "veggie" person, but he even went back for seconds. Definitely saving this one to my recipe box! Thank you for sharing!

I have made this twice now.  Both times I used broccoli and cauliflower combined.  For the dressing, the first time I made it with the mayonnaise and the second time I replaced the mayo with plain low fat yogurt.  Much healthier and just as tasty!

I halved this and used two avg broccoli crowns. Too much mayo flavor is not to our liking so I mixed half fat free greek yogurt and half mayo just for preference.  I also reduced the sugar to about a third and probably could have left it out. t would be too sweet for us. I eyeballed the bacon and cheese but I'm sure I used less than half of each and it was plenty.

This is an absolutely delicious salad.  I have made it at least a half dozen times.  I have to double it as my son wants it for lunch the next day.  I cannot put onions in it as I can not tolerate them raw  so I put granulated onions in it.    When I have grape tomatoes on hand, I add some for color.........but it is perfect as is!

Love, love, love this recipe.  It's great for all occasions.  I make it when I'm tired of traditional salad.  Made as directed, you can't go wrong!  I find I look for excuses to make this salad so I can eat the leftovers.  Yum!

I was scared to use lemon juice so I stayed clear from that, we doubled the recipe except for the pepper and wow. Shouldn't have used any pepper at all, and shouldn't have doubled the vinegar. We had to add more mayo after, the pepper was too strong. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I like broccoli salad, maybe not this recipe 100% but it's good

I made this to go with BBQ ribs and wanted to give it a bit of a southwestern flare, so I added a cup of corn and some cilantro. Since I'm not a big fan of raw onion I sauteed them briefly in a little bit of the bacon fat. The nippy cheddar cheese I used was white. It's not a low cal salad for sure, but very tasty!

The only thing I did different was to add golden raisins and sunflower seed. 

I let it sit in the fridge for 3-4 hours before tasting. My two cents are that there is wayyy too much onion and that it was too salty for my taste.  Looking back on the ingredients, it kind of seems obvious that half of a red onion is A LOT unless you're using a really small one.  As for the salt, with 8 pieces of bacon I'm not sure if you really need that much salt added to the dressing.  I think next time I will limit both ingredients and use about 1/4 cup of onion to start and perhaps skip the salt and pepper in the dressing and just add it after the salad has had a chance to sit for a while according to taste.  Hope this helps anyone who reads this review!

Just made this for some workers who are doing some repairs on our house.  They went absolutely crazy for this salad.  Told me not to change a thing.  Two of them don't even like broccoli and after tasting went back for more.  I made this exactly as stated in the recipe.  Served it as a side for a Ham and Cheese quiche.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you

This is the best broccoli salad, and easy to make. I did use packaged real bacon pieces rather than cooking up bacon, but other than that made as written. I am sure we will be making this again and again; perhaps, we will add golden raisins and sunflower seeds in the future.

Very addictive - to save time I use real bacon bits instead.  Also added dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and use powdered sugar instead of granulated. Use less pepper and omit the lemon juice.  Be sure to mix up and taste dressing before pouring!

I used this recipe more for the dressing, leaving out the bacon and adding dried cranberries and walnuts. It does taste good but I was hoping for a little sweeter taste. A bit too much pepper and cheese. Overall a good recipe, personally I'd make a few tweaks.

Great recipe, great flavor, however we didn't care for the cheese. After letting it sit over night in the fridge(as recommended so the flavors can marry) the shredded cheese seemed soft and mushy. I'm a texture person, so not a fan of anything mushy. We will make this again but we'll leave out the cheese. Thanks!

I made this recipe after having it at a friend's BBQ and wound up making it for another BBQ three days later. Even non-broccoli fans were willing to give it a try thanks to the bacon and cheddar cheese.  Turned out each one of them liked it and went back for another small serving.  I left the recipe as is with the exception of reducing the ground black pepper to 1 1/2 teaspoons, which reduced the spiciness of dressing to better suit our taste. I recommend grating the sharp cheddar cheese yourself over using the pre-shredded kind.  The flavor was more prominent and even after careful measuring, appeared to use less cheese than when measuring out the pre-shredded cheese.

This is a great recipe.  I can't imagine it with 2 teaspoons of pepper though - a dash is plenty.  And for me the cheese and bacon make it quite salty enough.  I don't add any at all.  Make it well ahead of time but add the bacon at the last minute or serve it in a separate bowl so it stays crisp .

Easy to make because I have the ingredients in my pantry and refrigerator. Added walnuts for crunch.  Reminds me of one served at cute soda shop/deli in old town Brenham that we love.

The basic ingredients are great but way too much red wine vinegar. Next time I'm only going to use 2 or 3 tablespoons. My first attempt was a double recipe where I only used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and doubled everything else. To fix this one I had to had 3 more heads of broccoli, more mayo and spices. Tasted great after that.

This was really good.  I served it as a side to Aunt Ro's beans from this site and it was just what the meal needed to keep it crisp and fresh tasting.

My husband loves his mother's broccoli salad, so I attempted this recipe with the hopes of matching it.  I succeeded and exceeded as he said it was better than his mother's recipe! I do recommend that you eat it within two days, because after that the ingredients are too soggy and melded to enjoy.

Served your dish with Grilled Salmon I and Sarah's Rice Pilaf. What a delicious meal. Added a fist-full of diced dried cherries I had on hand.

Great version of Broccoli Salad!  I made this as it seemed less sweet than other versions and it was really great.  The only substitute was that I used real bacon bits as opposed to cooking bacon strips.  I used about 5 Tbsp's of real bacon bits and this worked well.  The red onion and red wine vinegar cut the sweetness of the sugar.  I served this to someone who had never like broccoli salad for many years and they actually changed their mind about this version!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I had to tweak just a little since I didn't have red wine vinegar.  I used apple cider vinegar, my whole family loved it.  Definitely adding to my recipe collection.  I passed on the onions since my kids don't like raw onions and it was still great.

I've tried several, but this is the best one yet.  The lemon juice and red wine vinegar, are the perfect contrast for the sugar and mayo.  Give this one a try!

My 3 year old absolutely LOVES her veggies, and broccoli is no exception. Tonight I was looking for a simple and quick recipe for dinner to use up our broccoli, and this was perfect! She devoured it as did I, she wanted thirds! She dosen't like cheese, so I omitted that but when I served myself I just shredded some on top of mine, and it was mild, cause thats all we happened to have. It was still so yummy! I also didn't think it was too peppery, but that is because I a, a big pepper fan, so I would recommend adjusting it to your taste. I also cut the broccoli in rather small pieces and I liked that better than in big chunks with the stem. Another thing I would have done is added craisins and sunflower seeds or walnuts if I had them, but I didn't have any on hand. Otherwise, very good, simple, and so quick!!

Wonderful.   I made it as written with the exception of cutting the pepper in half.   The only complaint I had was if someone scooped from the bottom of the bowl without mixing first.   That was a little vinegarry from settling out.   I think there is a lot of things you could do with this recipe such as adding green peppers or peas.

This is excellent. Add a little extra cheese and bacon. Sauce base is just fine don't worry about the pepper it just gives it a little kick. Definately needs to be made early so it can absorb the flavors. Try for at least a 3 to 6 hrs but not more than 24, you don't want it to get to soggy. stir it every once and awhile too.

I am always looking for a new way to prepare veggies.  This is a keeper.  All I did was added one tbs of minced garlic to the sauce.  It is a great left over.  I took it to work the next and wished I had more.

When I told my husband the name of this recipe he was not terribly interested in eating it, however after eating it he enjoyed it. The kids even enjoyed it. They are 2 and 6.  I made some adjustments based on what I had like using a yellow onion and rice vinegar. I also just cubed about a cup a cheese and it seemed to be plenty. I only added a couple dashes of pepper. Other than cooking the bacon, this is a quick recipe so perhaps I might use the precooked bacon in the future.

Because of cholesterol issues, I altered the amount of cheese, bacon and sugar and added black olives to make up for the flavor loss.  Everyone loved it.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! When I was pregnant I literally lived off of this salad and grapes... I actually add less vinegar (usually just a splash) cuz my taste bud like it better that way, but other than that I don't change a thing! It is beautiful!

Cut the fresh broccoli very close to the flower and saved the soft stems for stir fry. I used a combo of basil/oregano rice wine vinegar & a bit of balsamic since I was out of redwine. I also added some chopped red pepper for more flavor. I took this to a party with kids & adults. It was devoured.

Great recipe. I made this salad for a barbecue and received many complements. I did add some dried cranberries for contrast. Use of less red wine vinegar may be a good idea also.

Totally loved it- even my brother in law whose a picky eater, I tried to use this as a base for the salad that they have at Souplantation. I doubled the dressing recipe- minus the lemon next time b/c it was too tangy. I also added raisens, unsalted peanuts (next time will try cashews), and plain sunflower seeds. I didnt use any cheese b/c I was going for a more sweet flavor and didnt want to have too much going on. You totally have to let this marinate in it's juices for a few hours, I let it sit overnight and it was fantastic, it's too tangy to eat right away- the raisens add alot of sweetness and the bacon mixed very well with it.

This has become a family favorite. I did tweak it a little by adding Craisins and I cut the pepper to around 1/2 tsp and the salt as well. Still, the vinegar, sugar and lemon juice gave lots of flavor

This was a great salad.  I served it up with the Spoiled Baby Back Ribs (from this site), and it was a terrific alternative to a green salad.

I really love this recipe because of a few ingredients I have not used before in this type broccoli salad.  I will use this as my go to recipe for this salad with a couple of changes.  For my taste a little less red onion is better and I added dried cranberries.

I did not like this salad nor did any one in my family. The red wine vinegar was way too strong and killed it for us. It need something more then just bacon and cheese.

I found this recipe to be good but not great. I enjoyed the flavor very much but found that it was still lacking something. or maybe had to much of one thing and not another. I will make it agian but i think next time i will use a little more sugar to tone down the salt. overall good though.

I made this salad last night and it was VERY good.  The only thing I would suggest is to use a little bit more mayonnaise.  It was a little dryer then we're used to.  I also added in a handful of cashews and raisins.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I used fat-free yogurt instead of mayo b/c hubby hates mayo. I think I will cut back on the red wine vinegar next time, as it was too noticeable for my tastes.  Also, be sure to add craisins and sunflower seeds, it really gives it great texture!

Great recipe--especially if you can get garden-fresh broccoli and onions. I used a head of broccoli and one of cauliflower, used a little bit of mayo and made up the difference with yogurt, cut back on the pepper, and threw in some sunflower seeds. I bet some raisins or Craisins would work, too. I have to go to a picnic in a few weeks and I'll probably bring this recipe. It's terrific!

Great recipe, although I have to say I like Alyson's Broccoli Salad recipe much better.  The raisins and sunflower seeds in hers add so much, and I felt like the seasonings in this one were a bit overload, although definitely delicious.  I think next time I'll do Alyson's with some black pepper and cheese taken from this recipe.  Very good though!!

I've always hated broccoli my whole life but this recipe changed my palate. Its spectacular! I give this a 5+. I only had minor changes and used splenda, added sunflower seeds, cut down a little bit of the cheese (mild cheddar) and onion (finely chopped) and added a pinch of cayenne. I will always remember my first lol. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This recipe is perfect for a low-carb salad, just substitute slenda for the sugar. It's a nice change from the sunflower seeds and raisin type of broccoli salad.

Good, but way too much red onion. All I could taste was onion and I even used 1/2 the amount the recipe called for. I would use crumbled sharp cheddar, the shredded got soggy because you have to prepare the salad in advance. Or I would add the cheddar right before serving. I'd also add a few handfuls of golden raisins for some sweetness to balance out the spice of the onion. I used the Lois Rich Turkey Bacon in it as well which was very good.

I've been preparing this recipe for a few years now. It is a favorite of all my friends and family. I'm actually getting a little tired of making it...lol...because everyone expects me to bring it wherever I go. I make it exactly as the recipe is written. It is delicious! I'll bet it's even better the day after, but I'll never know, there's never any leftovers. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a 5 star recipe for sure.  I didn't add the lemon juice as the dressing taste fantastic without it.  I think the lemon juice would likely make it too bitter.  I used half broccoli and half cauliflower.  I cubed the cheese instead of using shredded cheese.  It was great the first day, but 10 times better the following day.  Great potluck dish!

Delicious!  I added raisins and sunflower seeds.  I also added a little more sugar, and next time I'll omit the lemon juice.  It was a little too tangy.  One teaspoon of pepper is plenty.  My 4 children even ate this salad and they don't care for broccoli that much!  Great recipe!

Not bad, I don't have a lot of vegetable-eaters around over the holidays so this probably wasn't the best time to try it.  However, I left out the bacon (vegetarian in house) and put in dried cranberries and dry roasted sunflower seeds.  It kept well and was great with my turkey leftovers.  I'll try it again for a summer picnic!

Our favorite cold side salad.  I cheat and use the "real bacon" packaged bits.  Also Fat free mayo to help the cause. Easy and good.

This is wonderful!  I did read the other comments and left the lemon juice out, and cut the pepper way down.  I also added crasins and toasted sunflower seeds!  It is delicious!

Interesting combination of ingredients. I never really had a dish with raw broccoli - I would say - very good. I took someone's recomendation to use yougurt and it tasted excellent. I only use 2tsp of sugar - does it even need the sweet? I'll try without next time.

I Loved this! I used frozen broccoli, used onion powder instead of onion (all I had), bacon bits instead of bacon (again, didn't have the ingredient on hand), used 2% colby and monterey jack mix (all I had), light mayo, and I omitted salt (as I do for most recipes). I will definitely make it again =D

I found the dressing way too salty.  I threw out 1/2 of it, added another 1/2 C mayo and more sugar and it was much better.  I will do 1/2 the amount of salt in the future.  I also added raisens and sunflower seeds.

I like how the dressing doesn't overpower the tastes of the broccoli and bacon.  I omitted the onion due to personal preference.  Great stuff and hope its a hit this holiday weekend!

Sooooo Good. A wonderful fresh summer salad. The only modification I made was to add a bit more sugar and a bit more mayo to make it a little creamier.

This was good, but my family prefers my other recipe better. The recipe I have  is sweeter and calls for golden raisins and less cheese.  I think I'll stick to my other recipe for a sweeter salad.

OK, I admit I'm mostly rating the dressing, since I make the salad any old way it strikes my fancy, depending on what ingredients I have on hand. (You can't do it wrong.) But that dressing -- wow!  I love it!  I do cut back the pepper to just 1/2 tsp. when I serve it to guests because I know not everyone is fond of strong pepper taste; but either way, it's a great blend of flavors.  I've also used the dressing for mixed green salad with good results.

This salad is a little more tangy than I am used to, but in a good way. When I first made it, I thought it was too tangy, then I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and when I tasted after that, it was amazing. I did add cauliflower and broccoli slaw to it and left out the onion and onlt added 1 tsp pepper. It was awsome!!! Its only been here for about a day and is already half gone just between me and my fiance!!!

Overall the recipe was ok.  The dressing was very good but had too much pepper.  Next time I make this, I'll half that and also make a little extra of the mayo/vinegar because I like mine a little more creamy.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I am going to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow and WILL be making this again. Instead of sugar I used a pack and a half of Splenda. I also used the "fully cooked" bacon. I cooked it in a skillet until it was crisp. There was very little fat from the bacon left in the pan. I used the same pan to toast pine nuts. I made the dressing as per the recipe, however I made extra to make the salad a little more creamy. I didn't add much salt. Next time I may try this recipe with low fat cheese and mayo. If you like cauliflower I think that would work mixed with the broccoli.

Made this for a Thanksgiving salad, adding about 1/3 cup of craisins.  It was SO colorful and looked great!!! Got lots of compliments. I had also taken suggestions from other reviewers and cut out the lemon juice and most of the black pepper.  It was very good, but felt a little overpowered by the onion--think I'll try less next time or maybe even switch to green onions.  Anyway, this will be a Thanksgiving staple from now on!

We grew brocolli in our garden this year and I ended up making this salad several times. We LOVE it. I add craisins & sunflower kernels. Makes a perfect side dish to any meal.

The dressing was way too peppery and the amount of vinegar was overpowering.  
I prefer 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tbsp red wine vinegar.  I add in a bit of honey too for extra sweetness.  Also, I toss in some candied pecans and raisins.

I made this for my parents and my dad is the fusiest eater ever! He ate it up and had a bit more. If it passes my dad's plate it's a 5 star recipe. Note- I didn't measure exactly I used this recipe as a guideline as what recipes are about except for baking. Thanks!

My family really loves this salad. I add sunflower seeds and golden raisins for the best flavor/ texture combination.

YUM! A little less vinegar for me. Raisins add the sweetness that I like. Cashews for crunch. Thanks!

This is a favorite of ours.  I have been making this recipe for years.  I do use less red onion and no sunflower seeds.  I have added fresh diced tomatoes when they are ripe in my garden.  Have handed out this recipe to family members across the US.

Great recipe. The only reason for four stars is that I made some adjustments. I added raisins and sunflower seeds. As other reviews stated it was a little heavy on the vinegar so I reduced that and I am not a big cheese lover so I greatly reduced that amount. Overall a wonderful recipe, I just made revisions according to mine and my families tastes.

This was the very first recipe i got from allrecipes.com. I brought this salad to a picnic and it was a hit. I could eat the whole bowl of salad by myself, it is sooo good. I did not tweak this recipe at all.

Delicious dressing! But I made a couple of changes.  I added cashews and raisins like some of the other reviews suggested.  I also followed the other suggestions to only use 1 teaspoon of black pepper, which was more than enough (especially if it's freshly ground).  Finally, I only added 1/3 c. sharp cheese.  I want to be able to taste the other flavors, not eat a cheese salad with a bit of broccoli.

Excellent recipe. I make this often. I avoid pork products so i've made this with several different substitutes. My favorite is cubed steak but beef sausage works very well.

I've gotten rave reviews on this salad and its a staple for any summer gathering. My only suggestion is to use MUCH less salt than the recipe calls for.  If you use that much, you won't taste anything else!

This recipe was pretty good as is but I found the vinegar and pepper to be overpowering the first time I made it.  The next time, I made a double batch for a party and added cauliflower and golden raisins, adjusting the pepper and vinegar to taste.  Everyone there loved the salad.

This salad is really great. MMMM! The only thing I would do differently is cook the broccoli just slightly, so it is a bit soft, but still crunchy. It was so good my boyfriend ate most of it. He would search out the containers of it in my fridge. But what I did eat of it was really good.

I'm not much of a broccoli fan but this turned out well. My wife's more of the broccoli connoisseur than I did and she enjoyed it. I never handled broccoli before so I was a but new to cutting up the broccoli heads but other than that everything else went smoothly. The dressing turned out pretty good as well. We'll make it again.

My husband liked this more than I did.  Just different tastes I guess.  I thought the red wine vinegar was overpowering.  I will try making it with red wine vinagrette next time....I'll get back to you on this!

Excellent salad for a church luncheon. Went over very well!! I agree with one of the other cooks. You do not need all that pepper. 1 tsp was fine. Will keep this recipe around though. Loved the bacon!!

Really Good! I left out the salt and pepper and let everyone add it at the table. I'll be saving this one to make again and again. I left the broccoli kind of big and it was OK, then I put the leftovers in my chopper and chopped it into small pieces and liked it even better. It did seem to have a lot of cheese so I may cut back on it next time.

This is also great HEATED up!  I only put about half of the dressing on it, but have both nuked it and baked it and it turned out YUMMY!  (Nuke it covered if you like your broccoli softer.)

This recipe rocks! I love broccoli and this is such a quick and easy way to enjoy it in the summer. I do add golden raisins to it for a slight change and will use different cheeses depending on my mood. I've even thrown in diced mild chiles and the Mexican blend of cheese for Cinco de Mayo. Not very Mexican but it went quick nonetheless.
It is my go-to recipe for potlucks and summer barbecues. In fact I am making it tonight! Mmmm, can't wait.

Took this salad to two picnics and got rave reviews.  I did add a few things...cauliflower, walnuts, snap peas and some pepper jack cheese.  But it's good without.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I thought the pepper added a great kick!  I used light mayo and I think I will try it with turkey bacon next time.  Do let the salad set a couple of hours before eating.

My husband likes raw broccoli, but as for me, not so much...  However, we both LOVED this great salad.  I cut the pepper in half and it was still quite peppery, but not overpowering.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe is awesome!  To make it even easier, I used Hormel's microwave bacon (it's not precooked, you cook it in its packaging in the microwave...no mess!)  I've made this salad three times in the past two weeks, and everywhere I bring it everyone asks for the recipe.  I followed the recipe casually (no measuring, just rough measurements) and I did reduce the amount of pepper.  It really is a crowd pleaser...if there are leftovers, the hostess always keeps them!  At least I get to take home clean dishes...

To make it a little healthier I use some natural (not oscar meyer crud) turkey bacon, LF cheese, and LF mayo (cutting down on the mayo a bit). This is a great salad and always hits the spot! Make sure to chill, it really changes the flavor.

I love broccoli salad but won't use this recipe again. I only used half the pepper and it was still WAY too peppery.

I have made this recipe several times.  I try to keep it a bit healthier with turkey bacon, Splenda and light mayo, and it is still delicious.  When I take it to picnics & so forth, I never have any leftovers to bring home.

This is so great. I do suggest letting it refigerate for a couple of hours to mellow out the onion, but otherwise a very great salad. I loved it.

I halved the amount of bacon, used a white onion instead of red, and used regular cheddar instead of sharp. This recipe gets me excited about eating raw broccoli, which is pretty awesome. Thanks.

I made this for Thanksgiving by using 1/2 cauliflower and 1/2 broccoli and using the food processor instead of chopping. The one problem was way too much pepper.  I doubled the recipe and only used 3 tsp.pepper and was still too much for most.(I love pepper!!!) I would suggest about 1/2 tsp. of pepper to start with, then adjust to taste.  My husband and I found that it was really good on sandwiches,used like cole slaw.  This is a delicious salad! In fact, my daughter-in-law has asked me to make it for her baby shower(she loves pepper, too)

This broccoli salad is so good!  I used half the amount of pepper and half the amount of red onion the recipe calls for and I substitute turkey bacon for regular bacon to save on the amount of fat.  I also use lite mayo but not the fat free stuff. I've tried it with lite miracle whip and wasn't as good.

I changed the recipe to match what I had on hand.  And it was FABULOUS.  First I didn't put in bacon as I don't eat meat.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I used Feta.  I added dark purple grapes cut in half, and I walnuts that had been candied with sugar.  I made the dressing as listed - next time I'd cut back on the pepper.  And I added a bit more red onion.  Really, really good!

We love this salad we have had it on occasion similar to this one.  One word of caution if you like to put extra pepper on your dinner plate this is the salad for you because it has plenty of pepper in it. Otherwise, I would cut down to 1 teaspoon of pepper.  One more thing the recipes says 12 servings, probable if you are having a big meal with lots of other things, and you eat like a bird but we are only 3 here and I served it with chicken strips and we easily polished it off and I don’t  think we were being greedy.

This is just like a broccoli salad my mom made growing up (we called broccoli bacon &cheddar salad/BBC) with the exception of the lemon juice, which I added to mine, I like the added zing! 
I always add the ingredients to the dressing gradually so that i can make it to my taste- some people like it sweeter or more vinegary... i also add the dressing in small amounts so as not to overdress, which will ruin this salad! you can always make a little more but can't take away.
Always a crowd pleaser...

This has turned into a must-make recipe for our family gatherings now. I used 6 broccoli crowns, not heads. There was less of the stem. This meant less waste of the unused stem parts. Another time I made this, I used two 2-lb bags of frozen florets (not pieces), and they work just fine as an emergency substitute. I found that making this ahead of time gave the best flavor, as did eating the leftovers the next day. The flavors really blend. Don't leave one ingredient out, no matter how odd it seems.

Wow!  I made this recipe for my mom's surprise birthday party on Saturday and everyone asked where I found the recipe for this. I made this just like the recipe calls for.  I put it all together the night before so everything was able to meld together.  If you make this you have to carry the recipe with you ... they will ask for it.  Not a lick left from the bowl!! :)

Very good -- followed others and cut vinegar and pepper in half, omitted lemon juice.  "Healthed" it up by cutting down on cheese, reducing amount of mayo, subbing half of mayo for Greek yogurt.  Added sunflower seeds and raisins and threw in some cauliflower as well.

Yum! This is a great change from salad or coleslaw. The only change I made was adding some sunflower seeds & using a combo of broccoli florets & packaged broccoli slaw mix. Great mix of textures, colors & flavors. My husband even went back for seconds & he doesn't normally like these types of salads. I will be making this again tomorrow for a pool party/BBQ. Thanks for sharing!

THIS IS ABOUT THE BEST BROCCOLI SALAD I'VE TASTED. I HAVE SHARED THIS ONE WITH MY DAUGHTER AND NOW IT IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE RECIPES THAT WE BOTH BRING TO PARTIES. EVERYONE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTS HOW GOOD IT TASTES. I LIKE TO CHILL IT FOR AT LEAST 3 HOURS BEFORE SERVING, AND IT JUST GETS BETTER THE NEXT DAY! THANKS TO CASSANDRA FOR A FABULOUS DISH!

I loved this recipe but like others made some changes. I did half cauliflower and half broccoli, I doubled the dressing and saved some to add to the dish for the next day as the caulflower seems to absorb the sauce. I didn't add the cheese (calories) and did't miss it. I also waited to add the bacon until I got ready to eat it so it wouldn't be soggy. I loved the tang of the vinegar and agree that it gets better the next day.
I am not a big veggie eater but found I enjoy them raw instead of cooked. This recipe worked out well for me. YUM!!

YUM! I followed this recipe exactly, only subbing turkey bacon for the regular bacon, and splenda for sugar. I also tossed in a handful of pine nuts. I had to stop myself from eating too much... I'm watching my carbs now, but when I stop doing that I'll be adding some raisins to this recipe.

This was quite good, but the dressing was too watery.  You need to add half the liquid and then adjust to your liking after all the veggies have been added.

Very easy to make, but I did double the dressing recipe.  The red wine vinegar really adds to the flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

My kids love broccoli no matter how it comes but I only like it cold.  So I whipped this up today and we love it.  It is delicious.  The only thing I did different was I added cauliflower and next time I think I'll use a little less pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Recipe was just OKAY.  I couldn't put my finger on why exactly it wasn't great.  I think it may have been a tad too sweet because it was very rich.

This is the most excellent broccoli salad that my husband and I have ever had. I used to buy something similar at the deli, but this salad dressing has so much more flavor. I think it would also be great to increase the dressing and add some pasta. This is going to be a great summer salad. AWESOME Recipe!!

This was yummy. The only thing I would change is I'd use white or cider vinegar rather than red wine vinegar next time.  The red wine vinegar made it a little more wangy than I'd like.  Otherwise, it's a keeper!

It's a little too rich for me.  I would like it better with more bacon, less cheese and less dressing.  Others really liked it though.

PERFECT!!!! I love the flavor of the dressing.  I made this for Easter today, and everyone wanted the recipe. I added some golden raisins & chopped pecans at the last minute just because I had it on hand. This is a great recipe! Thanks!

I forgot to rate this one - but my gosh.  This is a fabulous recipe and so easy to adapt.  I was suppose to take it to a cook out, but my husband and I kept taking itty bitty bits waiting to go and ended up eating the whole thing.  I had to make another batch to take for my sister-in-law to try the next day. Great summer salad and accompaniment to any summer cookout!

I made this for a dinner with neighbors and got RAVE reviews.  I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe!  One man had four helpings!  I did cut the pepper in half because it seemed like too much for the recipe.

My whole family enjoyed this.  I'm not a broccoli fan at all, but try to eat it since people insist it's good for me.  I chopped the broccoli pretty small, which was much better than the usual big "trees"!  I don't eat cheese, either, so saved mine without and added a handful of craisins instead ... pretty good, and I really liked the dressing! UPDATE:  I've made this many more times since the first time.  I still don't particularly like broccoli, but I love this salad!

Wow!!  I'm surprised at the great reviews.  This was way too peppery for our tastes.  There are several broccoli salads out there that taste so much better.  I won't make this again.

YUM!  Bodacious is a perfect name for this delightful dish that makes every single taste bud say "Thank you!"  Great way to get my 5 year old son to down an entire head of broccoli too.  I can't keep him out of this yummy stuff.  I absolutely adore pepper and would agree that 1 teaspoon is plenty.  Would also recommend finely finely finely chopping all ingredients to avoid leaving any ingredients in the bowl.  Also gives this very exact amount of dressing an opportunity to get on everything.  Roasted sunflower seeds are nice addition.  Thanks Cassandra!  This will be a regular on the table here!

YUM! I always hated raw broccoli before, but this salad was really delicious and crunchy.  Didn't taste like raw broccoli at all.  The dressing is really good and simple to make.  I did add some chopped tomatoes and also 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings to the dressing.  Good fast and easy recipie.

Made this for a family occasion, and I had so many compliments about it.  The only thing I did was use low fat mayo instead of regular, and added 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds.  It was a little sweeter than I usually like, but still very tasty and had good results.  I will definitely make this again.

I am doing the Michael Thurmond's 6 week makeover diet, and needed to modify this slightly (although i'm still cheating!). I used plain low-fat yogurt instead of mayo, and about 1 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. The shredded cheese ended up in a pile at the bottom of the bowl, so I will omit this next time, and save myself the calories. I think this definitely needs to be refrigerated ahead of time. I will also par-boil the brocolli a bit, and possibly chop it finer in the food processor. Bacon is a nice touch and unifies the flavors. Also used rice vinegar and balsamic instead of red wine (didn't have it). All in all this was a great tasting salad (even with all my modifications).

This is one of the best broc salad recipes I've found. I usually double the normal recipe and follow it pretty exactly and it is great. It is best after it has been chilled a few hours.

Gick!  I did not care for this at ALL...it was too tangy and you pretty much had to eat it with a spoon to not be left with piles of mayonnaise covered cheese and onion on your plate.  The bacon was overpowering as was the vinegar.  Sorry, this was just not for us.

Cut the black pepper back to 1 tsp and used Splenda instead of sugar and white wine vinegar instead of red.  This needed a little more dressing and definitely more bacon.  This is not as good as other broccoli salad recipes I have had.

Every picnic has this yummy salad on its table.  I use regular vinegar rather than red wine, a white onion rather than a red, and I omit the lemon juice and the salt (bacon is salty enough).  This recipe is a winner!

We really enjoyed this salad.  I made a few changes though...I added a bit more mayonnaise, added chopped water chestnuts, instead of seeds and added mozza cheese as well as cheddar.  Thanks for the good eats!!!

This was great!  I made it side by side with Allyson's Broccoli Salad and liked it better (though not a LOT better).  The lemon juice added a nice zip, a little softer than the zip of vinegar alone and there was less mayo.  I only used half the salt, and about 2/3 the bacon, but it still seemed a little overly salty to me.  My problem was tasting the dressing before adding the bacon, which increased the salt a lot.  Also, it is possible my mayo is saltier than other brands (I use Trader Joe's brand), all the more reason to   go easy on the salt at first and then add more if you like it at the end.  I was surprised how well it kept, too, since dressed salads are usually done for after a few hours, but the broc stayed nice and crunchy all day (maybe it would have been good longer but it didn't last!)

This is the best broccoli salad I have ever tasted. I can't keep this recipe in my recipe box because people keep asking for it. Thanks for sharing it with us!!!

Love this...I blanch the broccoli first only because I don't care for the taste of raw broccoli...make it for holiday gatherings and everyone loves it!

Was a great new taste for broccoli.  Would go easier on the onion next time though; seemed to overpower it a bit.

I had my reservations about this recipe - I don't like broccoli, but my wife loves vegetables so I decided to give it a try. I love it! This is certainly a repeater. I'm making it again for a church gathering tomorrow!! I'm making sure I get my share as well.

The very first time I made this recipe it was a HUGE hit with my family.  I've since had requests for it at every social function.  P.S. It tastes twice as good if chilled overnite.

I loved this!  I added extra bacon.  My boyfriend who claimed to hate broccoli salad couldn't get enough of this.  He said it was the best he ever tasted and he had never liked it before tasing this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  It is quick and a good way to use all the broccoli that is overflowing from my garden!

My husband frowned when I mentioned that I was making this dish to take to a cookout at a friend's house.  Boy, did he change his mind after tasting it.  Everyone really enjoyed it, I took home the leftovers and that husband of mine requested it be served that evening with our dinner.  Pretty presentation as well.  Thanks!

This was really good!  I increased most of the ingredients and decreased the amount of dressing.  Next time I might blanch the broccoli to make it a wee bit more tender.

This is a recipe that I've been making for years and I love it!  To make it super easy, I buy broccoli that is already cut into pieces and use pre-cooked bacon bits.

Very good.  I doubled the "sauce" recipe because it seemed a little dry, but maybe I used to much broccoli.

This was very easy, quick, and yummy! I used a whole bag of frozen Broccoli & Cauliflower cuts. Ran cold water over vegi's in a collander until thawed & then halfed all ingredients for dressing. It was a great side dish for two big eaters with leftovers for lunch. Thanks....

This had a really good flavor. I may add more mayo the next time so that the cheese holds to it.
Definately a keeper.

This salad was excellent, however, I don't think there was what I would call 12 servings.  It fed 6-8 people, but next time I'll just double the recipe.  Definitely will make again!

Perhaps I used too much broccoli, it is hard to tell with "2 heads" that leaves it wide open, but I didn't think there was near enough dressing or bacon in this recipe.  Would have been better with some cauliflower perhaps.  A lot of work cutting up all of that for a rather bland salad.

I served this salad for three recent get-togethers, and ran out every time. Everyone loved it! I made a couple of changes--added cauliflower to make it go further, and used shredded mozzarella instead of chedder. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love broccoli salad. You only need a basic recipe and can add or take away to suite your taste. The foundation is the dressing, and this didn't work for me. It was runny and the vinegar overwhelming.

I had to make a review just to tell everyone to NOT cook the broccoli like other reviews have suggested.  The raw broccoli is what give it the nice fresh crunch. I would suggest that you just finely chop the onion.  I have even just used a tiny bit and added it to the mayo mixture.  I have made this dish a million times and it is always a huge hit.  You can change it up as you want.  You can use cheese cubes instead of shredded cheese.  Add sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds. Use yogurt instead of mayo.  It is a nice base recipe.

Very good.  I did changed the recipe a little.  We like it a little sweeter then it called for so I added sugar to 1/4 cup and I put shaved almonds and dried cranberries for a added flavor.  Let this stand over night it's even better.

Added some pickled beets and used very thinly sliced smoked meat instead of bacon and rice vinegar instead of red wine and skipped the pepper. Very tasty.

I made all kinds of substitutions in this,  based solely on what I had on hand (including several fresh veggies that needed to be used in something), and I still loved it.  I had broccoli, carrots, celery, and snap peas.  I used balsamic vinegar because that's all I had.  Followed measurements and it was great.  I read someone else used yogurt instead of mayo to make it healthier and I'm going to try that next time.  There WILL be a next time!

Delicious! I only used half of the cheese and 2/3 of the sugar mayo combination. I actually omitted the vinegar only because I forgot It and only realized it later, but the taste was excellent. I added about a quarter cup of cut grapes as well. It was fantastic.

I was looking for recipe that was close to the Broccoli Cauliflower salad my mom has made for years. This seemed pretty close (and ultimately was), but there was way too much pepper for our taste. It totally overpowered the dish. I’d cut it back to 1/2 teaspoon, Max.

I followed someone’s suggestion to cut the broccoli small. Salad has nice crunch from the broccoli, bacon and sunflower seeds. I didn’t add raisins or cranberries to the bowl since some people don’t like them but tried some on the side with cranberries and it added a nice additional sweetness. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

After making this for a few years this is what I do that might help others..
make the broccoli as small as possible this step takes me about 30 minutes for 4 heads. I do not cook the broccoli crowns at all and only use the crowns NO stems.
Make the dressing like you do for coleslaw, mix the mayonnaise and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, 2t black pepper 1t salt and double everything else for the dressing use a quality red wine vinegar the cheap ones are bitter, taste the dressing before mixing other ingredients to it. if more sugar is needed add it then. 
I use the 1.5 C of cheese (shredded by me) for a double recipe but add more bacon. A thicker shredded cheese and extra sharp seem to work best in this recipe. Hope this helps with some of the bitterness others are having trouble with.

There are better recipes for Broccoli Salad. Way too much salt, pepper and vinegar in this version. Too salty and tart and all we could taste was the pepper and that’s after I reduced the pepper by half.

I like your style...8 slices of bacon! Yum! It was one of the best broccoli salads I've had. Lots of flavor and perfect for side dish or a light lunch. I have made several recipes, but I'm going to keep this with my salad recipe.

I can only rate tis 4 stars as I made changes. I nuked 8 slices of thick bacon and then chopped it. I did not use Bermuda or a red onion  as I find them to be too strong. I used a sweet white onion than I minced. I did buy red vinegar for the dressing, but found it way to tart, so I used some lite rice vinegar that I had. All that being said, the salad was very, very delicious and it was gobbled up at a potluck!  Oh, I did add a head of cauliflower and I thought that was great.

I omitted the dressing items and made a package of dry green goddess dressing with mayo and sour cream.  I also added some packaged flavored slivered almonds. You can buy it in the produce section.

I inadvertently left out the lemon juice and tasted it and loved it... then I noticed that I left out the lemon juice so I added it. Big mistake. I was able to doctor it up by adding a bit of apple cider vinegar and a bit more sugar but  I definitely won't add lemon juice next time. I followed one reviewers recommendation to blanch the broccoli and saute the onion for just a couple minutes. Excellent advice.  It ended up being very good.

Really good basic recipe.  Very good the next day.  I added slivered almonds and canned chicken the next day and it was totally a meal.  Definitely adding this to the mix.

The red wine vinegar was disgusting and I added more mayonnaise lemon juice and sugar to make it sweeter and creamier.

I have been making the Bodacious Broccoli Salad for at least 2 years and it is always a big hit with family and friends. I typically do not make changes to the recipe. It is one of those dishes that is better is the flavors have a change to meld. Update: I had champagne vinegar on hand and found I really like it as well as or better than the red wine vinegar.

This salad is requested for every summer get together I’m invited to. I use slightly less mayo and make it a day ahead so that all the flavors blend.

This had too much vinegar in it. Ended up using a little of the dressing and adding it to more mayonnaise to taste creamier.

Came out really good and I have made it for several events now. Would be 5 stars but I did have to tweak it. Way too much vinegar. I cut down on the vinegar and add more mayo and sugar than it calls for. I also use white wine vinegar rather than red.

I made this recipe yesterday for thanksgiving dinner. It came very nice and tasty!!! My whole family love this salad. I made few changes to the recipe. I used 1-2 tablespoon of mayonnaise and avoid sugar. I add little black pepper to spice a little bit. Instant of white wine vinegar I add red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing this recipe

Can't make enough! I've made this 5 times in the last two months and it disappears so fast, I rarely get more than a serving for myself. I used only half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper. I wash the broccoli in very hot tap water instead of blanching. (I can't seem to blanch without cooking the food). It's an easy way get a lot of a healthy vegetable into anyone that isn't getting enough of them.

I had purchased a similar salad from the grocery store deli, and thought I would make it for my husband. He liked the store version but did not like the raw broccoli aspect. I followed this recipe, but blanched the broccoli ( cooked for 3 min, then placed in ice bath). He said it was great because the broccoli soaked in the dressing. Making a double batch for company this week!

I'm used to making Alyson's Broccoli Salad, but decided to use this recipe instead.  Although it was good, I still prefer Alyson's recipe.  (I made the recipe as instructed & did not add any additional ingredients.)

Good recipe. I added half a cup of walnuts and half a cup of dried cranberries/raisins. The cranberries gave it a really nice punch of sweetness and played amazingly well with the bacon and cheese.

Two teaspoons of black pepper??? Has to be a typo and more likely should be no more than 1/2 a teaspoon. Unfortunately my wife gave me a hard copy of the recipe and I did not read the reviews recommending to cut the pepper way back. Although we like pepper, there was no way we could serve this at our picnic. After rinsing the broccoli and soaking for a while, we remade the dressing without the pepper and salvaged the dish. Recipe as written was less than 1 star but with the changes 4 to 5 stars.

This disappears everywhere I take it.   If you make it the night before, there’s no need to parboil anything.   A few tips-  bake your bacon, then microwave at 30 intervals to get it crumbly; make it the night before so the acids in the vinegar and mayo can tenderize the broccoli/cauliflower; soak your onions in water to decrease the “bite” of the onions.   I only soak mine for 30 minutes or so while I prep the rest.  If you make it the night before, use the dressing sparingly.   It will have more liquid in the AM and you can add more as needed ( make 2x dressing-you may need it the next day).

I made this for my husband and I a couple weeks ago. We just got married, so I was looking for some really simple but delicious recipes that I could make as we got into a routine. This salad is awesome!! I don't even like broccoli and I LOVED THIS!! Can't wait to make it again!!

Loved this salad. I added raisins and a chopped apple before serving. I cubed the cheese and made the dressing exactly as stated. It's a keeper!

Love the crunch of broccoli & bacon with that dressing, tangy and slightly sweet-I used coconut sugar for my version. Added sunflower kernels & omitted the lemon (I'm allergic) This is my "go-to" broccoli salad from now on. Thank you, Cassandra!

Saying the recipe requires "two heads" of broccoli is not very precise. I ended up with a broccoli salad short on dressing, as I must have exceed what the recipe's creator considers is "two heads."

I steamed the broccoli briefly so it wasn't hard. Next time I would use less red onion as it gives the dish a very sharp taste. Good recipe overall, very adaptable to tweaking.

I used pre-packaged crumbled bacon pieces (3 packages appx 3 oz each) and at least 2 full cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese -- so, more bacon and cheese than the recipe calls for. Everyone loved it!

I've made this many, many times since I first found the recipe years ago. It's always a huge hit and I will sometimes make it just for myself randomly. It's good for pot luck or for a side to dinner, or just a snack.... anything. It's easy to make too. For the bacon I just cut it up in pieces before frying it to make it easier and drain on paper towels. It's a very good recipe!

Wonderful salad! I did make some changes to suit my tastes and diet. I'm diabetic so I used 4 packets of Stevia instead of sugar, which added the perfect amount of sweetness. To reduce fat and calories, I used turkey bacon and only six slices was enough for me. I also only needed one cup of the shredded cheddar cheese. I did two tbsp of red wine vinegar and two tbsp of apple cider vinegar because I like the extra zing ACV adds. I don't think the salt or pepper are necessary at all. For me, they didn't go well with the dish. The biggest change I made was the dressing, because 2/3 cup mayo was not enough for me to sufficiently coat the florets of two heads of broccoli, so I upped it to a whole cup and still needed another 1/2 cup sour cream to have enough dressing while keeping fat and calories low-ish. I think this is really important because having enough dressing helps to ensure the broccoli softens after sitting. I noticed some people recommended blanching the broccoli to soften it a bit. I tried that and highly discourage it unless you're prepared to eat mush. Having enough dressing and letting it sit overnight is all you need to do to have slightly tender, yet firm broccoli. Also, I don't think two hours is enough time for the salad to marinate. Let it sit at least overnight for the best texture and flavor. I also used frozen broccoli once, but I do recommend using fresh stalks. The frozen broccoli had a strange juiciness to it that was off-putting and made the dressing t

I loved it, great to bring to a BBQ.  I love healthy food (and the taste of broccoli) so I prefered to use less dressing.  I also used a dried fruit medley of yellow and brown raisins, cherries and blueberris from trader joes instead of the bacon.  It was delicious!

Absolutely delicious! This is such a great cold side that complements so many dishes. I’ve made this a few times and everyone always loves it. I add a couple tablespoons of sunflower seeds for an extra bite. It’s so important to let the ingredients marinate together. I find that it tastes best after chilling it for at least a couple hours :)

Wow. This recipe is way off.  Too much vinegar, lemon juice and pepper.  I had to modify the dressing after preparation. Double the sugar and mayonaise. Cut the pepper in half, at least.

I am giving it 4 stars.  I failed to read the reviews ahead of time, but probably should have.  I think the pepper should be reduced to about 1 tsp, and for my personal taste, 1/2 of the amount of onion the recipe calls for.  It wasn't bad, just maybe too much pepper/onion flavor.

You need to increase the veggies in this recipe.  There is too much dressing.  Do not include the salt until you mix all ingredients.  I used half of the salt and it was still too salty.  The dressing is a bit strong (cut the vinegar and add more to taste after all ingredients are mixed together.

This was really good as written (5 star worthy for sure). I've made it a couple more times with a few adjustments - I cube the cheese instead of shred it. I use the real bacon bits and swap the sugar out for about half the measure in truvia and I add in almond slivers. Hubby loves it!!

Great crowd pleaser with lots of texture. I changed it up a bit by using agave nectar instead of sugar; next time will also try using nonfat plain yogurt instead of mayo (I used olive oil mayo). Get the Boars Head cooked bacon and microwave it in 30 second increments to save some time (and dishes) instead of cooking bacon.

My family and friends loved this dish. I added some unsalted peanuts which were a nice crunch. Allowing the salad to sit softened the veggies. I also mostly used the flowers tops not stems.

Delicious! I have added cauliflower at times and often will switch up the veggies; bell peppers diced up tastes great in this, IMO! It is even better served the next day. Do NOT substitute pre-cooked bacon; the "real deal" bacon is really important for the flavor. Always a hit at dinners, work functions, BBQ's, and most any occasion.

I omitted the ground pepper because I leave that up to individuals to add their own. I also use balsamic vinegar instead  and I add a 1/2 cup of toasted almonds along with 1/4 cup of dried cranberries.

I cut the recipe to feed 2.  I made about 1/8 recipe.  I liked its not being saturated with dressing.  It went well with the beef cutlets in tomato sauce and mac and cheese I served with it. I'll make this one again.

I took the tip of softening the broccoli and onions by heating them in a skillet slightly before cooling them and mixing them with everything else. I dumped the majority of the  grease from the bacon and just used the leftover grease. Cooking the broccoli first reduced its size so next time I'll use more broccoli. For personal preference we'll also reduce the amount of cheese by 1/3. I'm eager to make this again, and may even try the yogurt instead of mayo tip.

I remember someone making this years ago for a party and I got the recipe from them and lost it. Happy to have found this. I do remember them telling me they heated the dressing on the stove while whisking to disolve the sugar and they poured it over the salad while still hot. I did this, as well. Also I used a bag and a half of broccoli slaw as that's what I had on hand and needed to eat it. Everyone gave it 2 thumbs up. This one's a keeper!

I always make this recipe exactly as shown except I add even more interesting flavors by adding some sunflower seeds and dried cranberry. Mmmmmmm soooo good, I always have to make triple batches if I take it anywhere. Two for the party and one so I make sure I have one for my family at home. It really is best to make at least a couple hours ahead of time to allow the broccoli time to soak in the dressing.

This was really good.  I used frozen broccoli but I  think it would be so much better as the recipe states and use fresh.  I will for make again but with fresh broccoli.  I was asked for the recipe.

This was good! I did end up adding in a little extra sugar and omitting the lemon juice, because I didn't want it to be too tart. I seasoned to taste with the salt and pepper instead of adding the amounts specified, which is always best to do with salt and pepper, IMO. This reminded me of a salad I used to make a long time ago that we just loved. Thanks for sharing. :)

Decent recipe but definitely had to tweak. I used half mayo and half non fat Greek yogurt for the base. Used half the amount of red wine vinegar and much less sugar, half the salt too. Still had way too much of the dressing, so I threw maybe a third of it out. Omitted onion, cheese, and bacon for my MIL (although I think all three would have been a yummy touch). Going to let it sit overnight to enhance the flavor. Added sunflower seeds as well (can't remember if that was in the original recipe or not now, I didn't follow it super closely). I would recommend making the dressing separately and introducing ingredients in smaller amounts and increasing to get the taste right (you can always add, but can't take away!).

This was very good. I did taste it as soon as it was done and I was worried it didn't turn out good. I let it sit overnight and had it for lunch the next. Definitely a difference, it was delicious! I did make another variation to see which I like better, the other recipe was almost exactly to this one instead I used Greek Yogurt. It was amazing! I will probably use Greek Yogurt moving forward. I used about 1/2 a cup of greek yogurt. I don't care for the vinegar taste so I will probably only add a splash next time. Overall, great healthy recipe that I will be making a lot in the future!

Absolutely delicious.  First time I made it with regular vinegar, not as good. I decreased the amount of pepper to 1 tsp. The following day I had leftover white rice and fish, dumped them in the salad, it was even better. A keeper for sure.

This salad was delicious. I added some halved grapes. We like the added sweetness of the fruit. Yum!

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, but the salad was overpowered by the red onion. The second time I made it, I reduced the onion by half and it was delicious. The next time I make it,  I plan to add golden raisins because I love to balance the salty with a little sweet.

This is the first broccoli salad I've made, it was great.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine and also added about a 1/2 cup of craisins.   Yum!

It was good, but not as good as I had hoped. Partially my fault, I added 1 whole red onion instead of 1/2. I love onion, but it was too much...even for me.

I also  added 1 head cauliflower, and it did up the floavor and color of the dish.

Loved it, great blend of flavors. I was searching for an alternative to lettuce or spinach salad for a side dish. Followed recipe except for cooking bacon in microwave. Hubby liked it and he hates most green veggies. I've added this to my meal list. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not make any changes. The onions bothered my husband's stomach, so I probably won't make it again soon.

This was amazing.  I never cared for raw broccoli unless I soaked it in some kind of dip first.  We eat a lot of broccoli in my house so this is a refreshing change from the norm.  I honestly can't believe I've never heard of broccoli being prepared this way until now.  People need to be told about this!

I used 1 tsp pepper, bacon bits ( didn't want to take the time to make bacon) and added chopped walnuts. It was a big hit and I will make it again! Stuffed a chicken breast with the leftovers and baked it, yum.

Because my daughter is a vegetarian I omitted the bacon. I also used red wine vinegar infused with pomegranate and left off the lemon juice and added some chopped carrots. It was fantastic and no leftovers. My daughter asked for the recipe which she never does.

First  found this recipe years ago. Was so glad to find it on Allrecipes.com. I have added dried cranberries for another ingredient. It's wonderful. I recommend it to those who need a salad that is different from the same old pasta salad for a pot luck or family dinner with relatives.
My dressing for this salad is much easier. Use 2/3 cup mayo and 1/8 cup honey. I have never purchased red wine vinegar so I've used the mayo/honey version with great success.

My family loves this and requests it every time we have a family get-together!  My only modification is that I combined broccoli and cauliflower instead of using all broccoli.

I followed the recipe exactly--and it was the best broccoli salad I've had at a family gathering.  I was worried about the 2 tsp of pepper, but it was perfect!

Delicious!! I added one -two sweet apples. I usually choose Fuji but since sweetness in apples varies through the year I use whatever is best at that time.

I used apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar. I don't even measure the dressings according to recipe when I make it only for 2 servings, but it still turned out marvellous. In my food culture, it taste is almost similar to 'kerabu' (veggies with boiled fish, red onions, fried grounded coconut and coconut milk as dressing).

We have had this twice now. The first time I didn't make enough because I wasn't counting on my husband and 21-year old son liking it... but they DID! The second time I made the full batch and also tried subbing non-fat plain Greek yogurt in place of part of the mayo. Just as tasty and healthier too!  (And nobody else seemed to notice the difference so...)

Great healthy side dish.  I like cutting the broccoli down to bite-size, so then less of an issue on whether or not to blanch it.  Instead of sugar, I used two packets of SweetLeaf stevia.  Will definitely be doing this one again.

I finally got sick of the cliche College food, most of us have been there. While $0.49/packet of ramen is a deal breaker, it just doesn't satisfy anymore. Without much trouble, I managed to make this and served with baked potatoes and pork chops. I will be recommending this to my peers and mentioning it to my family. Thank you for sharing, and enjoy!

Love the mix of ingredients. I use fat free sour cream in lieu of any recipe made with Greek yogurt or mayonnaise. So I did here. And I also keep handy hormel bacon bits instead of bacon slices. Makes it a little more easy and convenient for me. Thanks for the recipe!!

Soooo good! Something similar to a broccoli salad served on the salad bar at one of my favorite restaurants, with the addition of sunflower seeds. I like to chop the broccoli pretty small, into bite sized pieces. I doubled everything and served with cheeseburgers and french fries. Thanks for the submission!

This is very good and can be slimmed down easily.  I used hormel pre-cooked  bacon (crisped in the microwave), light mayo, substituted 6 teaspoons Splenda for the sugar, and used 3 oz reduced fat (NOT fat free) cheddar , which was plenty of cheese.  Salt and pepper and lemon juice were added to taste.   I will be making this a lot this summer!

I used broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans, all steamed before tossing with the other ingredients.  Also substituted plain non-fat yogurt for the mayo.  Had a bit of a kick but enjoyed by all.

I prefer a broccoli salad with fruit and nuts but this is the recipe I use when I want to change things up or I'm feeding a picky eater. I usually add an extra spoon of mayo as well as an extra teaspoon or two of sugar, which makes it just perfect!

Love this!  If I use 1 head of broccoli, I usually use 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 c sugar, and 2 t vinegar, but everything else in the same amounts (I do omit lemon though).  Plus 1 cup of sunflower seeds for sure!!!!

I love the idea of this salad but  it calls for too much pepper,  salt, and season to taste.  Also cut the cheese by 1/3.  To make it edible today I'm going to add some chopped cauliflower.

I really like it I used less vinegar and only  3/4 teaspoon pepper.  I added cranberry's and raisins and forgot to put in the lemon and it was really good.  I used less cheese too.  So pretty much I made it up as I went.  I used less onion too.

I used this recipe as a guideline, and my salad turned out being really tasty! Used white wine vinegar instead of red, and added slivered almonds and craisins to taste. I also added salt and pepper to taste since many reviewers said it was too peppery. I also recommend getting the cheddar nuggets or cutting cheddar chunks instead of using shredded, as the big chunks of cheddar really gave it a wow factor, and I only used 8 ounces of cheese instead of the 12 ounces it lists, per reviewer comments.

This was so tasty and really easy to make.  I did find it a little salty though, so will probably cut down on that one ingredient the next time around

We were having guess over for dinner and knew that I had to put some sort of green on the plate. Just don't mind the mayo, bacon, and cheese!  It was delicious. My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and was still raving about how delicious it tasted. He did day that I needed to cool it on the onion. My mistake, I put a whole onion instead of half.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. It is a well-balanced version of sweet and tangy, and also has different textures that give it a great mouth feel. All the different flavors blend well together to make this dish a hit. It's especially refreshing on a spring or summer day. Instead of mayo I used greek yogurt with lemon juice and I also added dried cranberries and chopped almonds.

This was a great recipe. Every time I make it I end up with an empty bowl. Even the kids like it. I did make a few changes. I added red grapes that I cut in half. I also added nuts. I didn't use quite as much black pepper as the recipe called for.  Overall I have tried this recipe as it was originally posted and it was good, but the addition of nuts and grapes took it up a notch.

I loved this recipes. It is super easy to follow. The only problem I had was that I wanted more dressing so I had to make a little more to add.

Amazing and easy. I added chopped dried cranberries and candied walnuts for the holidays. Used low fat mayo and a little more than the recipe calls for. Lemon juice and sugar is key to cut the vinegar. Big hit. Thanks!

I very much enjoy this salad. It's easy, tasty, and saves well. I do not add raisins or nuts because I don't like them in my food. I've made this numerous times over the last couple of years.

A nice way to dress up broccoli. Lots of mayo so next time i make it I'll probably do a dab of mayo and the rest a plain yogurt.  I did steam the broccoli for a couple of minutes and sautéed the onions a minute to take out the bite.

This is easy and delicious. The crispier the bacon, the better. I used Edam cheese instead of Cheddar, and it worked well.

I took this recipe and made it my own. I felt the amount of red wine vinegar made the original dressing too bitter. I omitted the lemon juice. Added a little more sugar and some water to it. I also added pasta and chicken to mine. It was so delicious and my husband fell in love with it. It's absolutely a keeper in our home!

I love this dish, not only for a side dish, but also for main dish. I was introduced to this dish by my daughter and have now made it twice and cannot get it off my mind. It's wonderful. Just be sure to use a sweet onion or cut back on a hot onion.

I love this recipe! (even though I don't like reviews like this I find I have to write mine as such) I love it; however, I always seem to never be able to find red wine vinegar so I substitute it for apple cider vinegar and everyone LOVES this! Thank you for posting!

I have made this recipe for years, the only difference is, I've always used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise and lemon juice, and I've never used salt or pepper and it's always a huge hit! Nobody leaves without asking for the recipe!

I had lost this recipe from years ago when my aunt would make it for family bbq's.  I was excited to find it again, and with a welcome, extra ingredient--LEMON JUICE!  The lemon juice made a huge difference in the flavor, for the better!  I thought this salad was good before, and this recipe definitely went above and beyond!  My only heads up would be to add only half of the cheese and dressing, and slowly continue adding each until you're at the amount of each that you would like.  Each time I've made this recipe (or the other recipe, for that matter), it seems like the broccoli is swimming in dressing and smothered in cheese if you add all of the indicated ingredients. But, if that's the only suggestion I can come up with, this recipe is a pot-luck/bbq go-to!!!

Awesome recipe. Defintely try to make it with time to let it sit in the dreessing for awhile. I think it is even better made with yogurt instead of mayo.

I finally tried making this for the first time, and it is excellent! I didn't have any lemons/lemon juice, but it still tastes fabulous without it. I will definitely be making this again. Next time I think I will add a little bit more mayo & vinegar though, as I would like it to be slightly more moist.

Great family and friends gather around for a nice summer time salad. This recipe can be made to suit the taste buds of anyone. It can also be made a little healthier (cut back the bacon to lower sodium or no nitrite and can switch out the mayo for Italian dressing or olive oil.

'Only change was half a cauli for a one of the broc.  :D  I allowed it to sit overnight, but still had to make half as much more dressing.  No big deal doing that.  This was good, but not as good as others.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I've made it several times and didn't change a thing (okay, maybe a tiny bit more bacon because it's BACON). Everyone gobbles it up.  My friend had never heard of broccoli salad, and now he can't get enough of this and requests it frequently.  It's in regular menu rotation around here.

Very tasty way to serve broccoli! I just eyeballed the ingredients to taste.. I served with grilled marinated ranch chicken and later chopped up the leftover chicken and salad to make chicken salad for the next day. Also delicious! 
I did steam the broccoli for 2 minutes in the microwave before making the recipe...just made it a tiny bit less al dente.

I used white balsamic vinegar, did not add salt or pepper, and added cooked pasta shells. Next time I will chop the red onion since the slices are potent. Yummy!

Always a crowd pleaser! I try to go light on the mayo and I don't use bacon to cut the fat. Still just as good. This is one of those recipes you can tweak to your taste. Love that I can hide my veggies in this creamy goodness.

I would have given this 5 *'s but after mixing the sauce into the cut broccoli (I used half cauliflower, too), it was immediately obvious that there was not nearly enough to properly coat all the veggies.  So, I had to get everything for the sauce out again and make a 2nd batch.  Not difficult, of course, but annoying, as I was short on time... So, taste: 5*  ratio: 3* = 4*  ;-)

I thought this was pretty good, worthy of 4 stars, but definitely not 5.  There is just so much overpowering flavor from the dressing, onions, sharp cheese, bacon etc. that it's hard to taste the broccoli.  The dressing overall just tastes like your standard strong creamy italian, I kind of thought, might as well just buy a bottle and dump it on.  I think the champagne vinegar is a must to make it a little different.  There is also too much cheese in this recipe (I'm NEVER one to usually say too much cheese), but I'd reduce it by half and add raisins and sunflower seeds.  The raisins added a bit of sweetness that's necessary.  I will make this again but do half the cheese with raisins and sunflower seeds.  I also may try this with sweet and sour dressing.  REAL bacon is absolutely necessary as well, but I think bacon bits are nasty.

I've made this to spec and absolutely loved it. It makes a weekly appearance in our house. I've also played with additional ingredients, mainly in the spices department, most recently adding some chipotle pepper. Bottom line I can't get enough of this salad and neither can anyone I've served it to.

I made this as a side for Easter since I didn't want to be in the kitchen cooking all day.  It was OK.  I actually thought it was a bit dry. I added 1/3 cup of yogurt to the dressing before I poured it on because I suspected there wasn't enough to cover all of the ingredients, and there still wasn't enough. It's not a 'do-again' for me.

As a pantry chef at a retirement community, I make this salad on a rotation menu. I made it at home because it is that good! Even my three year old loves it, ain't that somethin'? I decided to serve it warm, and since I didn't have any, I left out the red wine vinegar and lemon juice, and omitted the sugar. Still great!

Too sweet and tangy. Thank goodness for the bacon which help offset it and made it kinda yummy. This time around the only change i made was cutting the mayonnaise down a little, i don't like over saturated/ creamy food. Next time I would cut the red vinegar and sugar in half. Definitely better to cut the broccoli smaller everything will get covered.

This is almost my exact recipe. glad to see someone else leaves out the raisins and nuts..lol I can't see how 2/3 cup of mayo is enough for all the other ingredients. I use 2 cups mayo, 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 tbls of vinegar...I also just use a few shakes of pepper...don't use Miracle Whip, totally changes the taste of the salad. I also don't use lemon juice...make a day ahead, taste even better

So we're over at the beach and had a LOT of broccoli and was looking for a cold dish to use it with.  This one sounded like the Broccoli Salad that I've gotten many times at the deli.  I just finished making it and was about to put it in the fridge to cool it before dinner time and my daughter tasted it and loved it.  I told her it wasn't ready, since it wasn't cold yet, but she said it was and had to have a bowl now, lol.  I only made 2 small changes, only used 1 tsp of pepper(2 seemed like a lot) and I used 2 cups of mild cheddar(what I had on hand).  I added more cheddar since its not as strong as the sharp cheddar the recipe called for.  To say the least it's a hit and I haven't even served it to the family yet!

Love this salad. Instead of regular bacon I use 'fake bacon' by morningstar, it cuts the fat. Also for one member of the family, I get a small bag of chopped walnuts and mix it in, they like the nutty flavor. Almonds,pecans add a nice flavor, sesame doesn't add any flavor at all, but does add some protein. I tried once with a yellow onion, was too much, but the red works perfectly.  Next batch I'm going to try yogurt instead of Mayo, and lower fat cheese, maybe add some bow tie pasta.

Loved it. At a reviewer's suggestion, I sautéd the onion in a bit of the bacon fat for about 1 minute just to pull out the flavours. Be careful with the red wine vinegar. Add a little less then taste. I also added 1/2 cup of grapes and a 1/4 cup of each sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds for a little added crunch. I'm eating the leftovers as I type  It is delicious!

Tasty, and I feel virtuous for getting fresh broccoli into my family! Next time I'll use less vinegar and mayo; they overpowered the freshness of the broccoli and the satisfying muskiness of the bacon (I used turkey bacon). I recommend a little less vinegar, a little less sugar, yogurt instead of mayo (or half of both), more lemon juice. I love salt but didn't feel that it needed any; maybe it depends on saltiness of your cheese and bacon. Also, I chopped the broccoli pretty small and used plenty of red onion. Mine didn't look remotely as pretty as the video...in the video it looks like there's hardly any dressing whereas mine was coated in it (again, the too much mayo thing). Hope this helps! Enjoy!

So delicious and easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly using low fat mayo, reduced fat cheddar cheese and precooked bacon pieces.  Brought it to a friend's cook out last night and it was a big hit! It calls for quite a bit of black pepper...I only used 1.5 teaspoons instead of the 2 t listed but I may cut it back to 1 t next time I make it.  Tastes great on day 2 as well.  This will be a summer staple!

Absolutely delicious salad - whole family loved it; the only thing I would recommend would be to reduce the amount of red wine vinegar by 1/8th of a cup, and add an equal amount of mayonnaise in.
For a variation, I used a garlic havarti in place of old cheddar, and added slivered almonds to the mix - not that the recipe needs changing but just for something different!

I made this for a Christmas family gathering and it was a big hit! I almost didn't any. Very small portions if you want it to serve 12. Next time I will use at least 3 Broccoli crowns.

I made this salad for a potluck and got several compliments on it. The only change I made was to omit the bacon since I (and many others at the party) am vegetarian (and to decrease the pepper as several others had suggested in their reviews). I substituted some sunflower seeds to add a little saltiness and crunchiness that the bacon would have provided. I wished that there had been a little bit more of the dressing and might make a little extra next time.

Hit the Spot Yummy!
Changed fresh onions to French fried onions, because my family does not prefer the sharp bite of the fresh onions.  Had to add a bit more mayo to mellow out the sharp tang of the vinegar.  Two easy changes and everyone was digging in for seconds and thirds.

I am not a huge broccoli fan, but as our garden is producing multiple huge heads of broccoli, I was looking for something different to use it with.
I did the recipe as directed, with the exception of pepper (cut it back after reading other reviews), and added some medium pasta shells (left over from last nights dinner). Excellent salad, and the bacon and cheese was a hit with my hubby. Thanks!

Good classic broccoli salad.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Some of the negative reviews said it was too peppery.  You should always use your head on this and adjust those kinds of spices based on your taste.

I was attempting to duplicate a great broccoli/cauliflower salad that I found at my local Amish market.  I left out the onions and used equal parts broccoli and cauliflower, chopped very fine.  No need for the extra salt, I think. I used white wine vinegar instead of red, but I think that's a minor point.  I never measure anything, so a recipe like this that lays good groundwork is very valuable!  Thanks!

Use one head of cauliflower and one head of broccoli for an even better salad.  I have made this salad for years; the only difference is my dressing adds no lemon juice or pepper.  My kids loved it and it was a great way to get vegetables in them when they were younger.

I had to make several changes, was 5 stars with them! (sorry to the ratings police).. :)  I've used a recipe from this site for "broccoli salad" before but this apparently wasn't what I was remembering and I couldn't find that one, that's ok... I simply took out the cheese and added 3 stalks diced celery and sunflower seeds.  I upped the sugar so it wouldn't be so tart/tangy; I like about equal parts sweet/sour.  I'm not sure why it even needs the lemon juice but I did add it.  I thought 2 tsp. of pepper was way too much so I sprinkled what looked like a good amount, (maybe 1/2 tsp).  It's better after it sits a few hours.  Good stuff!

This salad IS Bodacious!It was so good I had to share with friends(a group of Natural cooking mommas). Everyone enjoyed it (lots of compliments) I did have to make a couple of modifications due to what I had on hand,  I only used 1/2 of an onion and I used apple cider vinegar. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks

This was a very good recipe.  I followed the directions but added more bacon and it was delicious.  Next time I might not add as much of the red onion as it seemed to overpower the dish, or maybe I can use a yellow onion to take down the bite.  But I will definitely make this again.

I think this is the best broccoli salad ever! I have made it several times and, because of personal preference, I don't add the pepper. It is popular with my husband and children and is often requested at cookouts and parties. It is awesome as is but sometimes I adjust it according to whom I'm making it for(a little more or less sweet, more sauce, raisins, sunflower seeds, etc.). Every time I make it I am so happy with the results, it's delicious! Thank you for sharing :)

oh, man... I lost my broccoli salad recipe so I google it and found this recipe. It was just TOO SALTY!!! I was very embarrassed to serve this salad dish to my guests. If you wanna try this recipe, cut of the salt part.  I would be planty salty with the bacon, mayonnaise, & cheese.

This was a really powerful side dish for my meal. The sauce has a punch to it and is yummy. Next time i would serve this with a mild dinner, like baked chicken and mashed potatoes, and this salad would be the star.

Excellent! (I did swap out the purple onion for yellow since I don't like purple onion and I added more bacon but other than that all was the same).

This recipe is great and super easy! I've made it twice over the holidays this year and would only add that you need to make sure you cut the broccoli into relatively small pieces... pistachio sized or smaller. This was it will be easier to eat and also stays together better.

I really like this recipe, I add raisins and sunflower seeds and it is great!  I only used 1 tsp. of pepper, and it was still too much, don't see how you could eat it with 2 tsp.

I love broccoli salad, but there's a lot of fat in this one. I did some tweaking and managed to cut out quite a bit of fat without compromising the flavor. I cut the bacon to four slices, cut the cheese to three quarters of a cup, used Splenda instead of sugar and cut the mayonaise to one third of a cup. I added a couple of tablespoons of sunflower seeds and a couple of tablespoons of raisins to compensate a bit in the taste. Excellent.

I've been looking for a long time for a broccoli salad recipe, and I could never find one that seemed right.  So I tried this one, and I followed it exactly! Firstly, there was not enough dressing to coat my salad as evenly as I had hoped.  Secondly, I find the red wine vinegar gave it a very distinct, and unappealing taste, that's the only way I can explain it. I've never used red wine vinegar prior to this recipe.  I tried adding more mayo, and more cheese to see if it would diminish the tart taste, and it didn't work. Would not use this recipe again. Sorry :(

This was awesome.  Made it for dinner with friends as a salad replacement and they asked for the recipe! I used thick cut maple bacon and added in some ranch dressing.  Delicious!!

I wished I read the reviews first.  I ended up rinsing off the dressing and starting over.  It was way too salty; the cheese and bacon adds enough. My next try I omitted the salt, and used half as much vinegar, & a dash of pepper - much better and still full of flavor.

Very flavorful. I added in some halved cherry tomatoes for more color. Also cut the recipe in half (12 servings is a lot) and used real bacon bits and bagged, precut broccoli for convenience.

i've tried various recipes looking for less sweetness.  this one is delicious and with decreasing the amount of sugar makes it even better !!!!  the cheese (esp fresh grated) makes it the best recipe !!!

This is a great starting point for broc salad. The dressing and everything is perfect, but I like to add more stuff. It just isn't the same with out raisins. If you think you don't like raisins in broccoli salad, try yellow raisins...mmmm. I also like to add chopped water chestnuts, and sunflower seeds. Now that's a broc slaw!

I didn't think it was all that, but everyone at the BBQ loved it. It was the only side dish that was completely gone. In all fairness it wasn't completely chilled when i tried it, so that may play a factor for me. Adding sugar really made a different, doesn't make it sweet but takes some of the bitterness away. I would definetly make this again. Actually plan on doing it again in a week. P.S ( i used frozen broccoli, just thawed it in a colander)

So good! I used *4* heads of broccoli and did not need to increase the amount of dressing. Healthier maybe? I also added slivered almonds per others' recommendations. Loved it!

I made this for a picnic 4 days ago.  It was a hit and I was asked for the recipe by 3 people.  I found it to be delicious

This was easy and great. I made it w/out the lemon juice and with apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because thats what was in the cabinet. It was still awesome!

Just took this to a church function and it was the first dish finished off.  I only used 1 1/4 tsp of pepper though.  I am not a pepper monkey! :)  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I'll definately do this one again!

Had a group of 10 people over and everyone loved this! Made a double batch and everyone went back for seconds! I guess everyone can like broccoli!! The only change I made was using mayo with olive oil and I blended the dressing!

Excellent recipe!  Does benefit from the addition of dried cranberries or raisins and the zest from the lemon.  I used it for a wedding and the guests practically lick the bowl out!

Excellent recipe, the vinegar adds a nice touch. The only change I made was to use half the sugar and just a few tablespoons of cheese.

This is my favorite dish, I have had it several times at picnic's and family gatherings but this is the first time I actually made it.  There are so many variations of this dish but this one is my favorite.  I used a whole pound of bacon an entire bag of shredded cheddar and doubled the dressing (all except for the vinegar) only because I prefer mine more sweet than tangy.  Definately not a light version, but full of taste!

We liked it, but way too much black pepper for the amount of mayo mix. I used 1 1/2 tsp. and it still was too much. Will make again with less pepper, say about 3/4 tsp. also a little less salt too.

Searched for a recipe that would match a broccoli salad that a friend refuses to share and found that this one is almost dead on.  The only change I did was to cut down on the pepper, add a dash (one teaspoon maybe) of dry Basil and mixed on one tablespoon of the bacon drippings to add the bacon flavor I love throughout the salad. I made the dressing first and let it set for a couple of hours then mixed it in the salad an hour before serving, this kept the broccoli and bacon a little crisper.

Everyone I serve this to loves it!  I think it is the best salad ever.  Instead of raisins I added dried cranberries because I don't like raisins.  It was even more delicious.

WOW this is delicious.  I did cut back on the amount of pepper only because I'm not a big fan and added a handful of raisins, but other than that followed the recipe...loved it!

My little sister LOVES broccoli salad, and this is the only recipe I'll make for her.  I've made this recipe for several years, and everyone loves it.  Lost count of how many times I've explained to people how to find the recipe online : )  My only advice?  Don't change a singe thing about the recipe.  It's delicious!!

A very similar recipe was given to me by my MIL and I have made this numerous times to rave reviews.  The one small change in hers is the addition of toasted (in the oven on 350 for 7-10 min) slivered almonds--like a 1/4 cup or so.  Super Delicious!

YUM!!!!  I tasted this before the bacon was added and was HOOKED.  Then I added the bacon and since it was so good without the bacon, I just leave it out now when I make it.  Saves the calories/fat anyway.  Usually I can take or leave broccoli salad, but this is way too good to pass up!  I think it tastes best the first day.

Very good recipe and well received by my family. I followed the instructions precisely. I think, though, that the next time I prepare this (and I will!) I will leave out the lemon juice and add extra bacon! Was slightly too tangy for me!

I couldn't find my usual broccoli salad recipe so I tried this one because of the good ratings. I thought it was a bit dry after adding the dressing in advance. Next time I would wait and dress it just before eating.

I have used this recipe for 2 years now and we love it!  I have changed it slightly.  I do not use the lemon juice, use splenda instead of sugar and instead of the sharp cheddar, I use a blend of colby and jack shredded cheese and black pepper to taste.  I occasionally add sunflower seeds and raisins.  Great recipe.

I thought I would love this because it didn't seem to be as sweet as some broccoli salads, but I really missed the sweetness in this salad. It was too much vinegar taste for me, and a little too much pepper. I did like it, but I probably won't make it again.

Followed the dressing recipe except less pepper.  Added raisins and almonds.  The salad was wonderful.  This will be the one I use from now on.

It's delicious! The only thing I changed was that I did not use lemon in the dressing. I also refrained from adding chopped onions as I personally do not like them. I also added carrots. I love it and my boyfriend asks me to make it constantly.

I have been searching for a recipe that was like a salad I had once at a potluck and had no luck of finding the owner before the dish disappeared.  I also substituted cauliflower for half of the broccoli, and only used 1/2 the pepper but otherwise followed the same directions.  The only change I would make is to omit the cheddar cheese and maybe add some sunflower seeds next time.  My Bunko group ranted and raved about the salad as is...no leftovers.

This was changed a little by adding fat free sundried tomato salad dressing instead of the mayo.

I thought this was very good.  I made it yesterday to go with dinner, and I'm eating the leftovers right now.  I'm not a big veggie fan, but I love this!  The only thing I would change is a little bit less vinegar- it's just a little strong.

I have been making this recipe for quite a few years now and always love it.  The pepper amount is way too  much and I love pepper.  I use about 1/2 tsp.  Even my son who hates broccoli will make this salad for himself.  I always take the extra time to cut the broccoli into tiny pieces.  I also peel the stock and use it as well it is worth the trouble. Keeps several days.

This is a wonderful salad to take to a pot luck event.  I reduce the amount of mayonnaise because I am not a big mayo fan.  I also add shredded carrots and raisins.  Yum!

I made this omitting the cheese but adding sunflower seeds and raisins.  Had to double the dressing but that may be because I had too much broccoli.  It is always delicious and served at my bunco party.

The recipe for the dressing on this salad is outstanding, though I had to double it so that the salad would not be dry. As far as the salad itself goes, I made a couple of changes. I used turkey bacon rather than pork bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice because I didn't have a lemon. I also added 1/2 cup each of sunflower seeds and craisins. Everyone very much enjoyed it!

Excellent recipe. And I never liked broccoli before I tasted this! I also use the dressing on macaroni salad instead of a heavier mayo dressing for something different at times.

I doubled the broccoli and mayo. I used one packet of stevia instead of sugar. I put in 1/3 cup cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. I omitted the lemon juice. We loved it!

Made this recipe for a picnic.  I did add a handful of Craisins because I like the sweet/savory flavor of dried fruit with onion.  I also used pre-packaged pre-cooked bacon bits instead of cooking bacon.  Everybody raved about the recipe and I told them I got it off of this website.  When I got home I realized that I forgot to add the lemon juice. Next time I won't forget it and I bet it will be even better.  Excellent.  You and your guests will be going back for seconds.

I've been making this broccoli salad for almost 3 years for parties and gatherings. The first time I made it, the pepper was overwhelming, so I made another batch to add to it, but excluded the pepper, and it turned out great! So now when I make it, I always make a double batch, but only use 1 tsp. of pepper. Everyone loves it and always asks me for the recipe.

This is almost exactly like my grandmother's recipe except that she used cider vinegar. Although the red wine was tasty in this version, in the future I will use the cider instead. I just like the flavor better. To lighten this up a bit, I used turkey bacon, light cheese and light mayonnaise. For those who want to try it, it really does taste better after it has had a chance to sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser. I add raisins and double up the dressing. I also use a little extra mayo to thicken up the dressing so it sticks to the ingredients instead of going to the bottom.

I made a few small changes, but this is most definitely a staple in our home -- FABULOUS recipe!  When I make this I usually do about 1 1/2x the amount of dressing (otherwise it seems a little dry to me) -- and I've used half broccoli and half cauliflower in the past and we liked that also.  I added about a cup of sunflower seeds for a little extra crunch, a little extra bacon (maybe 10 slices) and 2 cups of cheese) and once I have it all together and am about to either serve it or walk out the door with it to whatever function I also add a small container of either grape or cherry tomatoes right on top -- they add a nice splash of color -- and I have never EVER served this at a function without being asked several times for the recipe.  This one is most definitely a keeper!

Wasn't a favorite. Too much cheese for our taste. It sounded different from the other broccoli salads so I thought I would try it. I have one in my recipe box already that I will go back to.

I thought this had WAY too many onions and cheese, and the sauce was kind of bitter to me (due to the ammount of vinegar). I had normal sized broccoli heads, so I don't think I used too little, this just wasn't something that I liked. Sounded wonderful. :-(

This was a quick and easy, tasty side dish. Next time I will probably double the dressing ingredients and either cut down the lemon juice or omit it all together... it tasted a little overpowering to me. I will also save the bacon bits to be crumbled on right before serving so that they stay crisp.

I love this Salad! And so does my family. It can be very versatile. I use white vinegar,any onion sometimes I change the cheese(smoked gouda is our favorite).cashews, sunflower seeds any type of roasted nut. I always add grapes.Cranberries would be good too.If you don't have bacon any salty meat like salami, pepperoni.Great salad!

This is incredible. I've made this several times for after work parties and people always rave (and ask if my wife made it for me). To add a little sweetness to it I did add craisins and sliced almonds.

Bravo! This was a real crowd pleaser. I used broccoli florets from the store  and also finely chopped some carrot (because I had it). I didn't fry the bacon instead I used bacon "pieces" not bits and put them into the dressing to soften while preping the rest. I also didn't use the lemon juice, just because I forgot about it. Will absolutely make again....and again.......and again.

Too peppery for our taste, and a bit too acidic as well. I would agree with a previous reviewer who recommended a milder vinegar and no lemon juice. The classic combination of salad ingredients is fine, its just the dressing that is off. I have also seen similar broccoli salads that include sunflower seeds or nuts for crunch, which I like. I will remove this one from my recipe box and keep looking for a better one...

I've made another version of this. This one was pretty good. The only thing I'd do is reduce the vinegar and add pecans or walnuts.  I also used a vidalia onion instead of the purple.

This was really good and easy to make!  The sauce was very tasty, however when adding it with the bacon in the salad it came out too salty.  (I did use extra bacon, so maybe that was part of the reason.)  There were a lot of reviews I read that had changes/additions, but honestly the only change I would make would be to reduce the salt.  I will definately make it again!

This by far is one of my favorites! I get compliments every time I make it. I did change it up a bit though..I add cauliflower, carrots, radishes and sunflower seeds. Great for the flavor and the look of the overall salad! Every time there's a party to attend, I get requests for this one each time! Thanks for the recipe!

Have made this 3 times over the summer and each time it seems to get better and better!  You definitely, in my opinion, need to double the sauce as it just isn't enough left as is.  Even better the next day!  Very easy and great for parties or picnics!!

Great basis to start with but made changes based on other reviews.  I use 3 stalks of brocolli, a whole package of bacon, increased mayo as suggested, 3 splashes red wine vinager, no lemon juice, only 1 tsp. pepper, about 1/3 cup sugar.  I also threw in a handfull of sliced almonds.  I guess I should write my own recipe because I dilike when others do this but I want to give the credit to this submitter.  I took it to my sons scout dinner and everyone LOVED it.  thanks.

love this recipe any day of the week. 2 teaspoons of black pepper makes it very very peppery though so i reduced this to 1/2 tsp and followed the rest of the recipe to the tee.

I used this as a starter. Added Freshly Fried Bacon bits, chopped pecans, and a pinch of celery seed. Fantastic! Used for a work pot-luck lunch, and everyone enjoyed!

I love this recipe but gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things. I used half mayo and half plain yogurt, and instead of red wine vinegar used about 1.5 T white wine vinegar and 2.5 T apple cider vinegar (because I didn't have any more white wine vin, but I like it this way!).  I also decreased the pepper as others said, used vidalia onion, about 1 c cheddar and omitted the bacon because I'm a vegetarian.  This was a great base recipe and absolutely delicious with the changes I made - I also added Craisins, which were delish!

I was worried about the raw broccoli aspect, but I wasn't even able to tell.  It was delicious, great flavor.

I prepared this salad for a Memorial Day BBQ, and it was a big hit with my family.  The bowl was scraped clean.  Even my southern grandmother, who only eats vegetables cooked in bacon fat, LOVED this dish.

This was not a salad I will ever make again. Too vinegary. I tried to add more sugar initially but still was not crazy about it. Have had much better broccoli salads. IT would be good with a different dressing on it because the ingredients other then the dressing was good.

Pretty yum-o but more vinegary than I prefer. 
Also good with feta cheese instead of cheddar.

I only had a a bit of raw broccoli left so i decided to make a mini version of this using rough amounts. I actually used regular vinegar and the low cal Miracle whip as opposed to mayo with some splenda as opposed to sugar--virtually no calories and very good. Added no cheese and some onions and nuts.

Good recipe for summer picnics. Remember, a little mayo goes a long way! Also, I like to add roasted sunflower seeds and halved cherry tomatoes.  Always the first dish to disappear!

My family loves this salad!  While the recipe is delicious as is, we like to do our part in cutting back on a few things.  Since we enjoy balsamic vinegar, we used it in the place of red wine vinegar.  Instead of sugar, we used the equivalent amount of Splenda.  Low-fat bacon tasted just as good as the full-fat version and for an interesting twist, we added a healthy dose of Craisins.  It is amazing how tasty and versatile this recipe is.  Even with all the changes, it was just as dee-lish and the original.  Highly recommended recipe, no matter how you make it!

I enjoyed this dish but it didn't knock my socks off. It is something I might make again, though. I did end up doubling the dressing as it seemed a bit dry when I was mixing it.

Doesn't really need all that mayo, and light mayo works too.  Lower the calories without sacrificing taste.

Very tasty! My husband who is not a salad kind of guy really enjoyed this.  My two and four year old little girls even ate this up.  I stuck to the recipe with the exception of substituting half of the mayo with plain yogurt. I will definitly make this again.

I did half broccoli and half cauliflower and it was really good.  All of the adults really enjoyed it but the kids (4 and 2) thought it was too spicy and wouldn't eat it.  I will definetely make this again.

This recipe is so good.  My family has been making it for years.  It's even better if you let it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator before you serve it.  Just one thing to watch for...Gas!  Cheese, red onion, and broccoli...if you are eating a large meal it can cause pain.  But it is worth the pain for the flavor!

I am requested to make this salad all the time and also asked for the recipe often.  Reduced the pepper by half and used precooked bacon.  Also used reduced fat mayonaisse and it turned out fine.

This salad will make a broccoli lover out of the pickiest eaters.  I prefer my broccoli raw, so this was an awesome salad for me to make.  It's really good and fairly simple.  I'll be making it again for sure. :)

This was really quite good, kind of sweet, definitely tangy.  All the meat and cheese went over great with those non-vegetable lovers.

Such a versatile recipe, I changed the vegtables in it to broccoli,carrots and onion and added craisins. I used chopped chicken breast instead of bacon - very nice dressing.  I can see myself using this alot.

I used 4 crowns instead, used half the amount of black pepper & half the amount of lemon juice. Then added about a half cup of sunflower seeds & about three quarters of a cup of dried cranberrys. I took this salad to a party, got lots of compliments.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It is so easy to make!  I do however, feel that there is a little too much pepper, so I don't add as much.  I also use mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar.

This is the first time I've not raved about a 5 star recipe.  It was just ordinary.  The regular broccoli salad with raisins is much better.

Really good broccoli salad.  I didn't measure the lemon juice and I think I may have put too much in as it was a little too tart - but that was my fault.  Still good though and I'll for sure make again!

This is a great recipe! I only used slightly less than half the pepper and it was plenty. Even my fiance, who likes a lot of pepper, thought it didn't need more than that.

I thought this was good.  I halfed the recipe and messed up and put in too much onion, but that wasn't the recipe's fault.  I also used low fat mayo and cut the bacon back a bit and I thought it was good.

Fantastic salad!  I just couldn't add the 2 tsp. pepper because it just seemed too spicy so I added only 1 tsp. and it was still a little spicy...I can't imagine adding two.  Also try this to make this salad even better:  Take 1/2 cup almonds, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, 2 packages ramen soup noodles, crushed and 1/4 cup butter melted.  Mix together and spread on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Sprinkle this on the salad and it makes it really crunchy and wonderful.

This recipe is excellent.  The flavor combinations are delicious.  The raisins, sunflower seeds, and cheese make this dish a winner.

Overall my family liked this salad.  I used a blend of shredded cheeses instead of sharp cheddar.  Next time, I think I will add more bacon and cut back on the vinegar - it was a bit too zippy for me.

I love broccoli salad so I was very excited to make this one with all the rave reviews.  I am sorry to say that I was disappointed with the results. I followed the directions exactly.  At first the vinegar is way to over powering  Then it sat for a while and the vingegar mellowed and the other flavors became appearant.

The texture was nice and it was easy to make but the dressing was too sweet and a little too much cheese for me. I'll put less sugar and substitute feta or goat cheese in half the required quantity.  Will do this one again as liked the basic concepts.

I doubled this recipe & took this salad for a potluck at church. I made a few changes after reading prior reviews,  cut vinegar by a 1/3, 1 tsp pepper (plenty, omitted bacon (vegetarians.) i was planning to bring leftovers for my lunch...but surprise!  Not a morsel left, Thanks for another winner!!

I made this exactly as written, except with light mayo.  I found it much too sour with the cheddar, vinegar and lemon juice.  I would decrease those ingredients, and increase the bacon a bit.  Also would blanch broccoli for a nicer texture.

Had this at a picnic last year and have been wanting to make it ever since.  It was perfect for a cookout.  So easy and so yummy- a little heavy on the onion for my taste so I think next time I will use 1/4 cup and add raisins and sunflower seeds like the other suggestions.  Can't wait to bring it to a potluck!

This is my first review, I'm new to ALLRECIPES.  This salad was AWESOME!  I made it for our Labor Day picnic, and it was a hit!  Didn't have ANY left, which really says something if you consider how much food we had!  Thank you so much, Cassandra!

VERY GOOD!  I used white wine vinegar because it is what I had.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  Next time though, I will reduce the pepper to only 1 tsp and maybe use white pepper instead.  I will make it again though!

I work in a school and so I bring my lunch every day and wanted to try something other than the usual turkey sandwich or slim-fast.  So, I threw this together, literally..it is a quick dish to prepare when you take shortcuts.  First, I bought the bagged fresh broccoli florets and used the hormel real bacon instead of frying some.  Trying to do what I can to be health conscience, I used less cheese than called for and mixed 1/2 regular mayo and 1/2 lite mayo.  After making the dressing I sampled it and my first thought was OH NO.  But after reading the reviews, I ignored that,poured on the dressing and stuck it in the fridge.  So now I have eaten my broccoli salad for lunch and am very pleased with the results.  This will be something I have i my lunch bag often.  HAPPY EATS!!!

This is a great way to get your veggies in...I like raisins and sunflower seeds, plus found another recipe that adds tortellini for a twist.  Can scale back on the sugar a bit.

...After reading the other reviews I decided to make the dressing like DYANN suggested.  Turned out really good!  Put this together early in the afternoon and ended up adding more fresh brocc just before we ate...husband and I had this for dinner with hot rolls...was a nice light meal.  Thanks Cassandra.

I am eating it now - YUMO-O.  Like the some of the other reviews were right about the vinegar.  I added only 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar and 1 t of pepper.  EXCELLENT.  I am e-mailing this to a few friends now.

Could use a little less vinegar (and I love vinegar), but, other than that...perfect!  I recieved plenty of comments at the birthday party I made it for.  For extra texture, I threw in about a 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts.  You have to let this sit overnight; upon first taste, it is too strong, but, let it meld overnight and the flavors come together perfectly.

This was great I used the suggestions made by Dyann for the dressing.  I kept the amount of cheese the same.  I also added some sunflower seeds.  I could not stop picking at this even after dinner!  I am gonna have the leftovers tomorrow for lunch.  Thanks!

I made this for the fiirst time last night. It was a hit. Used 1 tsp pepper, and no cheese to slim down the calories. Yum.

Oh my gosh..I just made this today. It's super easy, delicious and actually a treat for us low carb eaters. Substitute splenda for the sugar..no problem! This is definitely a "repeat" recipe. Enjoy.

Very good. I actually liked the full tsp of pepper - what needed to be cut was the vinegar (I only used one TBS) and omitted lemon juice altogether. For a bit of kick, fresh crushed garlic is wonderful but just 1/4 tsp. It packs quite a punch.

Fantastic Salad.  I reduced pepper in have as per other reviews and it was perfect.  I'm going to make this for an upcoming bridal shower and I know it will be a hit.  Tried it on my husband and he loved it.

Delicious and easy! I loved this salad as a child, and made it for my DH for the first time--he loved it. The dressing is both creamy and tangy. I took it to a 4th of July picnic and received many compliments on it. I will make this again and again.

Love this salad and made it exactly per the recipe the first time (with the exception of less pepper) but found there was way too much cheese.  So, the next time I omitted the cheese altogether and threw in raisins instead..it made a huge difference and now this salad is SENSATIONAL !

My mother has made broccoli salad for years and people always request this at get togethers. This recipe is very good and very comparable. The only difference is my mom uses Miracle Whip instead of mayo. With this recipe I did change it a little bit by adding more sugar and not as much pepper. Initially there was too much mayo flavor, I don't like mayo. But all in all it's and excellent recipe!

This is a really good recipe... We like to use light mayo (helman's, or store equiv), and we use about a quarter the amount of vinegar, half the amount of lemon, and half the amount of sugar.  But that is just our tastes!  We also use bacon bits instead of bacon, and add sunflower seeds!  Yum!!!

This recipe is great!  I made it for a memorial day bbq and I am making it again this weekend for father's day.  We all thought it was a little too salty, but I am wondering if I accidentally put too much in since nobody else here complained.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used low fat mayo, it was just great.     I can't wait to see how everyone likes it this weekend, I have a big family filled with amazing cooks!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This would have been really good if it hadn't been insanely peppery. 2 tsp is far too much. You hardly taste anything else.

A good recipe, plus I incorporated suggestions from Dyan, and everyone enjoyed the salad. I really don't like broccoli and this is one of the only ways that I will eat it, so thank you for a delicious way to eat healthier.

I also made this for easter, and everyone asked me for the recipie.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar, to up the sweetness, and it was great!  Next time, I think I will put even more sugar in, and cut the onion down by half.

Great recipe. We add frozen peas in with the broccoli, and top with Almond Accent's (Sunkist).I also use Splenda instead of sugar. This salad is truly addictive.

This is definitely best if topped with roasted/salted sunflower seeds.  Also, use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  It adds such a better flavor, and saves you some fat content.  If you can make the dressing a couple of hours ahead, and then dress it just when you are about to serve it...awesome!!  I love this recipe!!!  Very easy to double as well.

I have served this salad several times since finding it recently.  We appreciate that it stays fresh for many days so we can enjoy the leftovers.  At first the pepper seemed like a lot, but it wasn't; it added to the dimension of this great salad.

There is something strangely addictive about this salad...!   It's more than just a simple liking, it really is somehow addictive for me! I really like how the broccoli is used raw, because all the vitamins and minerals are preserved.

This recipe was really good.  Had to double the dressing though or it would have been really dry. Using precut broccoli and cauliflowerpieces and precooked bacon pieces really made this easy.  Also added some slivered almonds.  Sprinkling them across the top really made the dish appear more attractive.

This is a wonderful recipes.  The flavors blend perfectly to compliment the taste of the brocolli.  The only change I made was a substitution of dried cherries for raisins.  A lovely dish to pass!

Everytime I make this recipe, I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I usually add a cup of salted peanuts or roasted sunflower seeds.

This recipe is fantastic.  I cheated on the bacon and just used bacon "pieces" in a bottle.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  My husband snacked on it before and after our regular dinner the night I made it...and the next day.  It definitely got his seal of approval.

This was delicious and well received at my family 4th of July party.  I used 3 broccoli crowns instead of two heads.  Also, I used 1 cup cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup garlic cheddar.  Like many others, I used roughly 1/2 of the pepper called for (I ground it right into the bowl so I can only estimate how much it was.)

LOVE this recipe!  OK, so maybe it takes a nice healthy vegetable, and makes it pretty unhealthy with cheese and bacon, but for special occasions, I say it's worth the indulgance.  Great for pot-lucks, barbeques, picnics, etc.

This is a good recipe for potlucks, etc.. I sometimes add a few raisins or dried cranberries for another flavor/texture.  Chopped pecans make a nice addition, too.

I used vidalia onion as the red onion is a little strong flavored.
A good dish for get togethers

This was excellent.  I am not a huge fan of veggies, but this was quite good!  I made it with light mayo, to lessen the calories and fat.  It came out great, and was filling enough to eat alone.

First of all for the record I hate broccoli, but because i'm on a low-carb diet, I have had to open up to veg's that I don't like.With that all said, I LOVED THIS SALAD I enjoyed every last bite, I can't beleive it.I made it really low carb by using splenda in place of the sugar and omited the onions every thing else remained the same.

I made this recipe for about 12 guests for Superbowl Sunday. This was not a hit  at all. Red wine vinegar combined with the lemon juice was way to tangy. I even added a little more sugar to try and sweeten it up. Next time I'd use just white vinegar instead.

Add me to the list of folks who love this! I halved the recipe & used a bag of fresh broccoli flowerets, which I kind of tore apart or cut up. I also reduced the pepper as per one reviewer since I was a little worried about that. Used Splenda to make it super low carb & voila!!! A healthy delicious side dish! Thanks!

Fantastic.  When I'm in a hurry, I use Hormel real bacon bits and pre-cut broccoli--it is super fast and easy and it tastes just as good.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I brought it to an office party and received numerous compliments about the taste, the texture, the color. An all-around great recipe that I will be sure to use again & again.

I did this recipe for Thanksgiving a real family delight. I did change a little with the onion and only added 3tsp. and used craisins, carrots, and cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup pecans. This was scaled to make 12 servings..

This was great.  The real verdict will come tomorrow when my boyfriend tries it (his parents own a B&B and his dad makes "the best" broccoli salad).

I didn't change the recipe one bit; although, I think that broccoli salad should be 3/4 broccoli, and 1/4 other stuff.  Mine turned out half & half.  This is ok since I love onion and cheese.  Perhaps our broccoli heads in Canada are smaller than elsewhere in the world?

Fantastic though.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll make it again and use a bit more broccoli next time.

This is a really good salad! It is quick and easy and to make it even more quick and easy I use the bacon crumbles you would use to put on salads.

I made a big batch of this for two different BBQ's we went to.  I thought it was ok but my husband really didn't like it and while no others said that, the bowl hardly got dented at all so I think they were just being polite.  I definately won't make this again.

This was really good... A great one for my low carb lifestyle.  I have a million ideas to doctor the dressing... I think I'd like to leave out the red wine vinegar and sugar and instead make a creamy horseradish sauce.  Really, the basic premise is WONDERFUL and lots of tweaks can make it "just your style".

I served this salad to company and it was a hit.  I didn't use all of the cheese - just added it until it looked like enough in the bowl.  Making the salad 24 hours ahead of time gave it a great flavor.

Great for company outing. I added the whole pound of bacon and doubled the dressing. I also used white vinegar and only 1 1/2t. black pepper. Everyone liked it, even the kids ate their broccoli!

This really was good.  My husband enjoyed it even though he's not a big fan of raw broccoli.  Took it to a potluck and everyone said it was their favorite dish of the evening.  I used precooked/crumbled bacon and light mayo.

This was good, I made some changes though. I used white vinegar instead of red, and I omitted the cheddar cheese. I also toasted some almond slivers and added them. This was a great recipe. It gave me another way to get my kids to eat more veggies!

Delicious recipe.  I love the fact that it can be prepared in advance and is easily portable.  I live in a resort area where potluck dinners are the preferred get together for tired skiers.  What does "bodacious" mean?

Oh my goodness, this is delicious!! I cooked the bacon in the microwave, left out the vinegar, and cut the pepper to 1 tsp. I cut the red onion into big slices so it could be picked out if somebody doesn't eat onion (like me):) I can't wait to make this one again.

Yum!! This is good and so easy to throw together. Why save it for potlucks? What a great way to serve raw broccoli. I put a little too much pepper in mine, so you might want to go easy on the pepper shaker.

The best! I must admit I added no salt and it was fine. (Bacon had enough salt.)

Wow was this delicious!  I used Splendra instead of sugar and slightly more mayonnaise. Best salad I've had in a long time.  Will make this for 4th of July BBQ.  I'm sure this would make an absolutely fantastic pasta salad, but I'm going to serve it as is.  Thanks - this was truly delicious.

Wow!!  And I mean, WOW!!!  I've never been a huge fan of raw broccoli, but the flavors involved in this salad sure took care of that.  The dressing is sweet tart and absolutely delightful.  We had this salad with Shrimp Scampi for dinner and it almost felt like summer again.  This is a KEEPER.

This turned out to be a hit at the family picnic. I wasn't quite sure on how much broccoli "Two heads" were. I bought two rubber banded bunches at the grocery store and actually had to double the dressing so it wasn't too dry. I didn't put quite as much pepper as it said and also added rasins! It was very yummy!

Love this salad although I adjusted the dressing ingredients to suit me...I like more 'sweet' and less 'sour' in my dressings.

I made this in the morning for dinner that evening and while I was at work my mother-in-law and a friend ate more than half. Needless to say, it's great. Next time I might cut back on the sugar a little. Would be perfect for a barbecue or potluck.

Absolutely delicious salad.  I make a bit more bacon and a bit more dressing to make sure the rich flavors get around enough. I've taken this to a few gatherings now and it's always received well. I've seen other variations on this dish, but this one is the tops in my book!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! I have made it for three different gathers and everyone has raved about it. I have already given the recipe to quite a few people.

I tried this recipe for Fourth of July with my very picky in-laws and they raved about it.
