Wowza! This salsa really packs a punch thanks to roasting the ingredients before hand. I could not find pequin chiles, so after reading up about them and their heat level, I decided to just double the serranos and jalapenos. Also, I'm a cilantro fanatic, so I used an entire bunch, and I didn't add the salt. The end result? A delicious, flavorful salsa that is quite spicy, but oh so addictive! Thanks HMAUSER!

A perfect salsa recipe! I love making fresh salsa and have tried many varieties.  This salsa has such a nice well rounded flavor.  Cooking the salsa for 5 minutes really does take the edge off the raw tomatillo taste.   We love hot salsa, yet didn't think this was to hot.  I even added several extra Pequin peppers.  No need to search any further!!!  Stop right here and make this salsa!!!

Love, Love , Love this salsa recipe and I live in Texas, home of Tex-Mex. I use it when I make my enchiladas suisas and serve it with grilled lime chicken as well. I roast the vegetables in the oven so that I don't have to watch them too closely.

I thought I had messed this up, cause I read the ingredient list first, prepared everything including unhusking the tomatillos, as that is what the ingredient list says. Then when I got ready to cook, I saw that the directions say to remove the husks AFTER dry roasting. That said I went ahead anyway and followed the rest of the directions. The result was amazing. Im sure it is easier to remove the husks first, so I would definately do that next time anyway. This salsa verde was pretty much perfect! It will be my go to recipe from now on. I couldn't fint pequin peppers, so like many other reviewers I added double the amount of jalapeno and serrano peppers. The result wasn't hot enough for our tastes, so I will adjust for that next time. One cooking note: The garlic and serranos will blacken much faster than the tomatillos and jalapenos. Next time I will add them in stages, as garlic does tend to become bitter if overcooked, and it would have been charcoal if I had left it in for as long as the rest. I had to fish around and remove half way through. I removed the tomatillos when the skins were blackened, just as they were splitting. Great recipe, wonderful authentic flavor. I have a very happy and impressed husband! Thanks!

Everyone loved this. I loved the roasting of the pepers and tomatillos. I did not have the pequin pepper but I added a pablono and lime to the salsa. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe! Love the dry roasting and mix of chiles. My husband is mexican- we've discovered that serrano peppers often give a better flavor than jalapenos alone in general.  Also, if you want to avoid the chile haze in your house you can roast the ingredients on the grill.  Just dont lose your serranos and garlic through the grates! Use aluminum foil or a pan. For a delicious milder version of green salsa you can use all or part poblano peppers which are traditionally peeled after roasting. Dunk them in ice water to help loosen the skins and don't stress out if you can't get it all.

Very spicy -- beware.  I used a blender, not a food processor, and it worked fine.  The salsa was a little less chunky than traditional salsas, but it worked.

This was amazing. The dry-roasting brought out wonderful flavors. Make sure you have your kitchen exhaust fan on though! Also, my local market didn't have the recipes chiles so I used 2 jalapeno, 2 serrano, 1 poblano and 1 anaheim so I am certain my end result was far less spicier than the posted version. Can't wait to make again!

OMG! We have hit the jackpot with this recipe! My DH has been trying to recreate the authentic mexican salsa that his step-mother makes for years, with no success.  I think we have finally figured out how to make it!! He loves it! I think the key part of the recipe is heating up the salsa to get rid of the raw flavors of the peppers and tomatoes. I even made red salsa using roma tomatoes instead of tomatilloes and it came out great! My DH put it on EVERYTHING and has requested that we have this salsa on hand at all times :-)

Great flavor, but a bit hotter than I expected.  Couldn't find pequin chiles, so doubled the serrano and jalapeno.  Added a bit of lime juice and some extra onion and cilantro, and this paired really well with the slow cooker guisado verde recipe from this site!  Just know it's gonna be hot!

YUM! This salsa was delicious. I couldn't find pequin chile peppers so I used 2 habaneros and and 1 green chile pepper in place. I blended it all up in the food processer and it was great! Spicy but good!

This is a wonderful salsa. We live in New Mexico and take salsa very seriously. This is one of the best salsas I have tried.  Also pequin chiles are typically not found with the fresh produce they will be with other dry chile pods or Mexican spices.

Excellent!  Added a jalapeno, a hungarian wax pepper & a few mystery peppers from a co-workers garden.  Very easy and tasty.

Great! I halved the recipe and couldn't find the pequin peppers, so I just left them out. I also removed the seeds from the jalapeno because our family doesn't like things so spicy.

Made this as directed; it did not disappoint. Nice heat, great taste. If you're having trouble finding the pequin chiles, you can find them dried at Penzy's. I use them all the time.

Great recipe, real simple. The tomatillos took a little longer than I thought they would. It kept well in the fridge for 5 days. Thanks!

thanks for the recipe to my now weekly tradition of making salsa, the only thing that I do different is add lots of peppers and its whatever peppers I have on hand but I make sure to add around 4-6 serrano peppers, 1 Anaheim, 4-6 jalapeno, and maybe 1-3
 thai chilies (note* I do not roast these peppers) I do however roast all the other peppers, but I love my food spicy......

Bursting with flavors, I added a poblano chili which added to the smoky flavor, I cooked some zucchini and added this salsa while they cooked.  Delish!!
