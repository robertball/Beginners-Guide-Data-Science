These are very close to what you get at a restaurant.  I add pepper to the bacon and change up the types of cheese.  I also toast the bread instead of using the skillet.  Definately a keeper.

Yummy, quick, simple and tasty.  Not much more I have to say.  These are great, a grown up grilled cheese.

Gooey, messy, tasty!!  Kids loved em'!  They wanted me to drop sandwiches (from the deli) at school for their lunches, well I ran out of time so I whipped these up and dropped them off (of course with my fingers crossed) I got a big THANK-YOU from the both of them when they got home!  Thanks K-R-A-F-T!

Yummy!  Quick easy but better than just a plain old grilled cheese.  I used swiss cheese singles but next time I may use pepperjack just to make it a little more interesting.  I used mayo on the bread but also used a little cooking spray on the pan.

I made these for a late lunch today so we could have soup and sandwiches during the big baseball games that are going on right now on TV.  My first batch was a little messy because the mayo when heated dripped down onto my pan BUT I used a little less mayo on the second batch and turned out great.  I also used swiss and american cheese and on a couple sandwiches, I added a dash of dill to the mayo before spreading on the bread and gave it a nice twist.

This turned out perfect and it was delicious! It was very, very easy to make. I never thought of putting the mayo on the outside, but it worked like a wonder! It was very good! RECOMMEND, and will make again. :)

This sandwiches are great!  My husband begs me to make him one all the time.  I've never heard of grilling bread with mayo instead of butter, but it was awesome!

I have made many similar grilled sandwiches before but never one using mayonnaise on the outside of the bread.  I used kraft chipotle mayo and it gave it a nice little kick.  I also added a slice of ham and used colby jack cheese.  this was super easy and tasted like a restaurant quality sandwich.

Really good, but I leave off the cheese to make it a little bit lower in fat and I also use fat free Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

Yummy. A perfect sandwhich. I never thought of putting mayo on the outside. I really liked how moist it made the bread. Reminds me of a super bird sandwhich at Denny's, but better. Thanks for posting this.

This is very good, but I think I like our 'recipe' better: Toast the bread instead of cooking it in a skillet. Spread 1 piecee of toast with mayo, add 1 slice cheese, lettuce, 1 slice of tomato, 1 slice bacon torn in half, turkey, then a 2nd piece of bacon torn in half, another slice of tomato, and your second piece of toast with mayo. Add a side of chips, preferably barbecue, a dill pickle spear, and you'll be in heaven.

Made this for an easy lunch today.  Used some honey ham instead of the bacon and swiss cheese.  I have never tried mayo on the outside of the bread before; but could not taste it and it browned beautifully.  A nice twist to the regular grilled cheese sandwich.

These were great except for the outside of the bread spread with mayo. I just couldn't bring myself to do that. Made them the regular way. Thanks!

THESE WERE TERRIBLE, BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. I USED LITE MAYO AND THEY SANDWICHES STUCK TO THE PAN AND I HAD TO THROW THEM OUT..IF I TRY THEM AGAIN IM JUST GOING TO USE BUTTER OR SPRAY WITH BUTTER FLAVORED PAM.

Didn't like this at all.  The mayo made it taste strange when grilled.  Just my opinion.

My husband loves this sandwich, he did prefer it grilled with butter over the mayo though.
