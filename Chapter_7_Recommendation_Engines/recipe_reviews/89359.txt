WHY do you folks rate a recipe when you have changed it?  What are you rating?  Certainly not the recipe shown.  Frustrating.  Salad as shown above was great

Really very good.  I came across this recipe when I was looking for something to make when I received some fresh picked asparagus.  I love arugula and was intrigued when I came across this recipe.  My husband hit the nail on the head when he said it was very fresh tasting and light.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  Of course, anything with bacon or asparagus or arugula is awesome and this one has them all!  I usually add some white wine and then grated parm before serving.  Serve with a crusty bread and you're good to go.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. I wanted to make this recipe a main dish, so I added sliced chicken breast and chopped mushrooms. I also rounded it off with a dash of white wine and freshly ground pepper. It was wonderful!

From the perspective of not being an asparagus lover, I have to say..this was great!  I doubled the garlic, and sauteed the asparagus a couple of minutes more than called for.  Skipped the olive oil entirely and used the bacon drippings for cooking the veggies.  Very light, tasty.  I served it with citrus-marinated chicken, but probably will skip that in the future and just go for the pasta.  Thanks for the yummy combination of flavors!

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. Even the kiddos. I used a flavored fettuccini that I had on hand, and that made it even better. I cut the bacon smaller than in half, and will cut it even smaller next time. YUMM-Y

I used zucchini instead of asparagus.  2 lemons made just over 1/4 cup of juice, I did not use the olive oil in the cooking of zucchini, but put it in w/ the lemon juice and added salt and pepper - mixed and poured over.  I recommend to crumble the bacon for more all around flavor.  The bites of just pasta were somewhat bland, but my husband says it's a nice summery dish.

I purchased the first of the spring arugula at our local farmer's market today, and decided to make this for supper. It was delicious! The only change I made was I used a chopped onion instead of the garlic. I am allergic to garlic. I sauteed the onion until almost carmelized. Will definitely make this one again. It was quick, too.

I can't imagine any pasta/vegetable combo that wouldn't be colorful and delicious.  This version was particularly "spring-like." And what elevates this version - it has bacon in it, of course!  Ohhhh, BOY what fantastic flavor that added, particularly since I left in a little of the bacon fat as well.  Had it not been for the fact that this was a little heavy on the lemon juice I would have easily rated it five stars.  I used only half the amount called for and it was still plenty lemony.  A good sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan upon serving made this perfect.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's so light but so full of fat. This was so good though! I had arugula I wanted to use up but not the full amount of asparagus. I halved the recipe and at the end added some leftover sauteed green beans & asparagus (about 1/2cup worth). Besides those changes, I also cooked the sliced garlic in the bacon grease instead of olive oil. I finished the dish with some freshly grated Parmesan. I'll only make for special occasions because it is dangerously good but DEFINITELY worth trying.

This was delicious!! I had to use baby spinach because I couldn't find arugula at the store (I will look harder next time!).  I hate to fry bacon so I cooked it in the oven for the 1st time and it turned out great!  I have to admit I did add some extra bacon!!  YUM-O as Rachael Ray would say!!!

The first time I made it I followed the directions but it was very greasy for my taste. So the next time I made it instead of adding the Oil to the Bacon Fat I used Chicken Broth. This time it came out much better and a little bit more figure friendly.

A delicious alternative to red or white sauce pasta. I skipped the olive oil and used the bacon grease to saute the veggies as other recommended. Also I've made it with or without arugula and mushrooms it was great both times, adjust the veggies as necessary.  It tastes great at room temp.

Even though this had bacon grease (omitted the olive oil) it still tasted very fresh and light, I think due to the lemon juice. Very tasty and a keeper.

This dish is great.  Very light tastin for pasta and easy to make.  One tip - don't drain the skillet after you cook the bacon.  I added shredded parmesan on top and it was a nice touch.  Thanks so much for the tasty recipe!

Good, but definitely needed the sprinkling of parmesan I put on mine.  Or salt.  This was definitely tasty though with the spicy arugula.  Thanks, it's a keeper ;)

Absoulutely LOVE this recipe! Each time I make it I've altered it a bit more just by adding some garlic powder, onion powder,, and sea salt. Now I make with whole wheat pasta, and tueky bacon for a healthier touch! Cut up Grilled Chicken makes this recipe to die for!

I followed the recipe and thought it was good but not great.   I will try it again but plan to make a few changes.   Definitely use more garlic, add chicken and grated romano cheese to give it a little more flavor.   The basic recipe is a good start though - just needs kicked up a bit.

This was surprisingly good!  I added a couple of thinly sliced shallots to the garlic and asparagus.  Couldn't find any arugula so I used baby spinach, adding it to the sauteed asparagus, garlic, and shallots, allowing it to just wilt before turning the heat off and adding the cooked bacon (I cut it into bite sized pieces before frying), lemon juice and linguine.  A couple of twists of fresh ground pepper and a big handful of shredded parmesan completed this fabulous side dish!  We served it with grilled strip steaks for a fresh summer meal.  Thanks!  We'll keep it in rotation!

This was great! I didn't have bacon so I sauteed some chicken breasts with a little sesame oil and olive oil; also substituted fresh spinach for arugula. I used penne pasta, which tosses nicely. The kids loved it too!

This was a bit dry and the arugula was bitter, I ended up throwing spaghetti sauce on it to make it taste better.  More work than it's worth

This was tasty but not wow!  I used whole wheat linguine and substituted proscuitto for the bacon.  I didn't care for the arugula (personal taste I guess), in the future I would use baby spinich instead.  If I make again I will also add toasted pine nuts and top with parmesan cheese for some extra flavor & texture.

I found this to be pretty blah.  I only added one tablespoon of olive oil because there was already enough oil from the bacon.  Might be better if you threw in half a cup of parmesan cheese to give it some substance.

This super light and fresh salad is remarkably easy to prepare. It's perfect for a light summer dinner, but for anything else (say, two little kids who hate anything even remotely healthy) I'd suggest adding a kick. I paired this salad with slightly roasted Roma tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles. Success!

I don't know how anyone could review this as bland???  It was one of the most flavorful dishes!  To "customize" to our liking, I added sliced cherry tomatoes and used whole wheat penne instead of linguine.

This recipe was really good. Quick and easy great for a hot summer day. I added pearl onions. I added the parm. cheese as recommeded and it made the dish dry so I put some pasta water in it.

Great light recipe.  Next time I would add a few red pepper flakes to give it a little more flavor but all in all we just loved it.  Next time I'm leaving the bacon out and will serve a BBQ Salmon steak over the lemony tasking pasta.  I will definitely make this again....Perfect for summer.

This was just ok for us. Smelled much better than it tasted. Very bland and way too much pasta vs other ingredients.

Excellent flavor! I scaled down the amount of pasta (and switched from linguine to rotini) and arugula and added cubed cooked chicken breast.  Delicious!

The grocery store didn’t carry arugula and I made this with turkey bacon- so good! I loved it. I doubled the asparagus and halved the pasta. Perfect!

Not sure I loved the taste of the Arugula so that may impact my rating.  I felt it could use more bacon.  It was easy to make.  May try again but with spinach instead.

Followed several suggestions and added chopped chicken (1 lb) and mushrooms (8oz) and replaced arugula with baby spinach (about 1 oz).  It was very good.  As other say the lemon juice makes it taste very fresh.

Just made again 6 years later and made as listed. Still a 5. BTW no way 5 oz of arugula. I used about 1 oz and served as a side dish.

We enjoyed this recipe although I made a few changes.  I too cut the bacon into bite size pieces and used zucchini instead of asparagus.  

I had arugula, not baby arugula, in the fridge so I chopped it and cooked it a short time with the other ingredience.  Also used the bacon grease and less olive oil.  

My husband enjoyed it with fresh parmesan grated over it and a glass of dry rhone wine.
