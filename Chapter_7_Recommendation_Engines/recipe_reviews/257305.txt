3.4.17  This is the second avocado-bacon deviled egg recipe I’ve tried recently, and all I can say is that this must be an acquired taste. I cooked whole bacon slices in the oven to keep from having to wash a skillet (cleaned the kitchen this morning), and then just crumbled the bacon.   Granted, the avocado does lend itself to a really creamy texture, but the the egg’s flavor seems flat/bland.  I added an extra squeeze of lime juice, but the bacon is about all that I could taste.  I have to wonder if a little bit of vinegar might brighten or enhance the flavor a bit.  It was OK, but I think I’m tossing in the towel on bacon-avocado deviled eggs.  This totally could be just a personal taste preference, so I don’t want to discourage others from trying.

I made these for a Christmas Open House party. Only a couple of people liked them. That surprised me because everyone there liked avocado. Actually, I didn't care for them too much. This recipe was OK but I thought the flavor  a little bland. However, this doesn't mean I won't try to make them again. :)  I love avocado in any form so I'll definitely be rating this recipe again.

Not a whole lot of flavor for me, I will be adding some salt & pepper next time along with some other spices.
