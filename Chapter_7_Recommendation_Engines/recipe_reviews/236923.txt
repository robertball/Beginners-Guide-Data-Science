I really enjoyed this. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and cut the cumin in half (which was perfect for my taste). My kids wouldn't eat it, but what do they know? I topped it with sliced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, fresh cilantro and a tiny dollop of sour cream. I'm looking forward to having the left overs for lunch tomorrow.
