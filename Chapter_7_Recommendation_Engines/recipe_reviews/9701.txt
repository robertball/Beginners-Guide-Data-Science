Best brownies ever! I didn't have the baking chocolate squares, but substituted 3 tablespoons baking cocoa powder and 1 tablespoon margarine for each ounce of baking squares. Melted all the margarine together, and added the cocoa powder with the flour to mix.Also, I only beat the mixture for 5 minutes. Very fudgy.

My kids love this recipe! This was the first "from scratch" recipe I'd attempted. I will never go back to boxed mixes! My kids wouldn't allow it!! By the way, 20 minutes isn't enough to thoroughly cook the mixture. I go about 30 minutes. A more experienced cook might suggest the "toothpick inserted comes out clean" test.

Sorry.... but after following the recipe to a 'T', I found the batter to be extremely thick, and during baking, the 17 -20 minutes was no where enough time. After 25 minutes the sides pulled away from the pan but the majority of the center was still unbaked batter.  I did not care for this recipe.

I will never use a mix again! These were so easy to make. They were absolutely delicious. Rich, chocolatey, moist. I am glad I used eggs from my farm so I didn't have any worries about licking the bowl, spatula, and beaters! Thank you so much for sharing this you made my family really happy!

Excellent recipe!! I Added two bars of chopped fruit and nut Toblerone candy bar and decreased the sugar to only 1 cup. It makes the brownies so much more rich, chewy and absolutely heavenly. Don't forget to decrease the sugar or it becomes too sweet.

Exactly what I want brownies to be like! I added white chocolate chips instead of nuts, and they were delicious! The only issue - they were not done in 20 minutes, more like 35 minutes.

This wasn't very good, surprising given all the positive reviews.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it took twice as long to cook (40 minutes), it was dry as a bone and way too crusty around the edges.  It's a good thing my husband and son will eat anything!  The middle was the only decent part of the whole thing as it was fudgy and chocolatey.  I will not use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly. They were gooey inside and dry on the edges. I don't know if is because of our altitude, we are at 5000 ft, but When they were supposed to be done they were still very raw. I cooked them for 13 more minutes, checking frequently. I would not recommend this recipe.

Wonderful recipe, with nice crunchy outside and soft chocolaty inside. I'm not a fan of nuts in brownies so I substituted a bag of semisweet chocolate chips. I've made them twice. Both times good reviews!

I cooked these for 10-15 minutes longer than required and they were still very gooey in the middle. I don't have an electric mixer, so I had to hand stir, so perhaps there is something an electric mixer can do that I can't. Next time I will try a different recipe.

Hands down the best brownie recipe I have ever made.  My husband and Dad love these! Not too fugdy not to cake-like.  Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Although sometimes I like to add peanut butter chips 
or chocolate chips to switch it up a bit sometimes.

ABsolutely Delicious but not the most chocolately brownie I have ever had.  Obviously it depends on the anount of chocolate one uses.  In the past, I have always used the Hershey's Syrrup recipe when making brownies but this recipe is certainly perfect for  a yummy brownie thats good n chewy also.  Thank you for posting...

I followed the instructions to a T, baking these brownies this afternoon for the full 20 minutes. The result -- a gooey mess that wasn't possible to eat without scraping them from the pan. I have wasted ingredients and disappointed dinner guests. Sue Narayan, White Bear Lake, Minnesota

These are by far the BEST brownie on here!! I can not see why anyone would alter this recipe, other than thinking they can improve something already wonderful! These are simular to a recipe I had a few years back and I lost that recipe in our house fire! I think this is better than the one I use to use
If you want a croud pleaser and a mighty tastey brownie these are the ones to make!

These brownies really are too sweet, and that's coming from a real sweet-tooth!! I cut them into one inch cubes which can only be enjoyed one per sitting. If I try these again I will use half the recommended amount of sugar. That might do the trick.

Occasionally I have been searching for the brownie recipe that was the one my mother used and taught me.
Unfortunately when she passed away, the recipe was thrown out by mistake.
I did remember that it was more than the "one bowl" recipe and everything about this one sounded right,so I tried it.

This was it or close enough.  They are just as I remembered...fantastic!

Thank you Julie!!!

My sister and I made it and the whole family finished the pan when it was cool enough to eat. Even my husband who's not into chocolate liked it. Thank you for sharing your awesome recipe!

As here in Brazil there are no
unsweetened chocolate bars, I used the
existing semisweet chocolate bar. The 
brownie was quite fudgy, but a little
sweeter than I would have liked.
Instead of taking 1/2 cup sugar off, I
decided to use chocolate powder in the 
same weight as the unweetened chocolate
squares called for in the recipe.

The texture is like a fudge brownie, real dense.  It's good, but too sweet!  Also doesn't come out of the pan clean, lots stuck to the pan.

These were fair but too sweet for me.If I made these again,which I doubt I will,I'd cut the sugar in half.Also like other reviewers,it took roughly 40 to 45 minutes to bake,then the edges were over-baked.I don't know why it says to beat the egg mixture so long,I'd cut that time down to a few minutes.
