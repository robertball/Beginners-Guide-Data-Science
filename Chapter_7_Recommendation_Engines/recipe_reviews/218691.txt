These were delicious...where's the optional sixth star? The recipe says it serves 12 but I doubled the batch and four of us ate every last fritter. Please note: When it says "batter" it's more like a dough. I thought perhaps I'd misread the ingredients when I doubled the recipe. Then I wondered if the clams were supposed to be with their juice (canned). Regardless, I stirred in as much flour as I could and dumped the rest (next time I might use a bit less). 

My husband's a real clam snob (coming from the razor clam capital of "the world"). I used fresh, diced horse clams which are at the very bottom of the clam-eating world. He raved about the fritters. Who knew!? Hence a sixth star!

Obviously canned clams are not for this recipe, had absolutely no flavor. Have no choice where I live. Oh well, just have to wait til I go back to Maine. Great fritter batter though!
