This is my favorite "quick" meal. It is delicious, fast, and inexpensive! What more could you want out of a meal? My husband, who HATES tofu, really likes this and my kids always ask for seconds!

The tofu really just served to dilute the flavor of the refried beans.

This just tasted like a tortilla filled with refried beans, but it was still good.  I'll definitely make this again... I might add a little more taco seasoning.  I couldn't taste it at all.

Quick and easy, and my extremely finicky vegetarian son actually likes these...  these will become a staple in his limited repertoire, thanks!
