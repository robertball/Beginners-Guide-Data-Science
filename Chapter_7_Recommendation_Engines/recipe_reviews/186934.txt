Anytime there is a mixture of soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and sesame, I know I will be in for a treat! But adding in hoisin sauce gave this marinade a wonderful Asian twist. I left out the chile-garlic sauce due to family's request for a milder flavor. But I did add in a smidgen of crushed red pepper flakes. I added Hawaiian rock salt and fresh black pepper. I thinly sliced the 1.25 pounds of flank steak against the grain. I placed the meat along with the marinade in a large one gallon ziplock bag and marinated for 8 hors. Grilling the beef did not take long at all. While grilling I noticed the wonderful aroma from the meats! I also got the nice brown sear on both sides, which I like a lot. The meat was tender, juicy and sooo flavorful...Mmm. The marinate soaked right into the meat tenderizing it all those hours. It just smells wonderful, looks appeatizing and tastes delicious! We ate the beef skewers in silence licking all the marinades off of our fingers. My family ate this up so fast, I don't think they noticed the red pepper flakes I snuck in the marinade! This paired perfectly with, "Sesame Noodle Salad," from this site. The sesame noodles are delicious too!

These were really good.  Next time I will set aside some of the marinade for dipping.  Left out the salt and they were fine without it. I would not leave out the sesame oil, though. It adds a lot of flavor.

I actually found this recipe when I was looking for something to do with a pound of ground beef. I first saw another recipe for skewered meatballs so I was inspired and basically just took the marinade added an egg, some panko breadcrumbs and combined it all.  I served the meatballs that I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds onto over steamed rice with a veggie stir fry and a bit of hoisin drizzled on top...yummy!

i made this meal last night and my roommates both think it was the best dish i've ever cooked them! i probably tripled the amount of ginger and garlic which i think the result paid off. in between beef i added small mushrooms, yellow and red peppers so they make a better presentation and it's healthier. do not omit sesame oil because it adds a great flavour. i also sprinkled raw sesame seeds on top before sending the skewers onto the grill, it turned out perfect, will make it again.

Great recipe! Due to personal preference I used extra garlic, ginger and sriracha and it was fantastic! I let it marinade overnight and it made the steak SO tender. I would recomend making extra marinade to simmer till warm and use as a dipping sauce. I served this with rice and steamed broccoli and my husband has already requested I put this meal into the "favorites" section. This would be great threaded onto skewers with veggies or on short skewers to serve as an appetizer.

DELICIOUS!!! This will become a family regular!  The kids thought it was a pinch spicy, but their taste buds need to become stronger and more tolerant of heat, so I will continue making as is!

Yummy, even my pickiest kid loved them. The marinade seemed to really soften up the steak as well.

Made as written and I have no complaints. I know a lot of people do not care for the taste of sesame oil but  it plays a big part in the overall flavor of this dish. I do not recommend leaving it out or substituting something else for it. I personally like it and was impressed with this recipe. It was packed full of flavor and reminded me of beef jerky except warm, tender, and juicy instead. Thanks for sharing Pat!

Very yummy and easy.  I didn't have time to marinate besides spreading it over the beef - still tasted great.  I added green pepper and red onion slices.  Yum!

I made these as Shish-kabobs along with Shrimp Kabobs, for a surf and turf on a skewer dinner, when family came for a visit.  I marinated the beef cubes for two days, and threaded the meat separate from assorted Veggies, and Shrimp ( as all cook at a different rate )   I should have started the veggies first and had to finish them in the Micro....but the beef was a Hit with everyone.  I used a sirloin rather than flank however, wanting the tenderness to be the best for my company.  I will use this marinade again, and might make kabobs more often now!

Wow, this was super tasty! I had a bunch of hoisin sauce left in my fridge and was looking for a recipe to use it up. Now I will be buying more so I can continue to make this dish. The marinade was really tasty, but not overkill - it was a really nice mix of flavors that went perfect with the flank steak.  And the steak turned out really tender (I marinated for five hours). I didn't use sesame oil since I had none on hand, otherwise I didn't change a thing.

This was well-received all around. It provides a robust, delicious Asian flavor without being salty from soy sauce. I doubled the chili sauce and the garlic, and added bell peppers, onions and mushrooms to the skewers before grilling. One thing to note: I used a bit less meat than the recipe called for (1.5lb instead of 2lb) because it's what I had on hand, but it made a *lot* less than 20 skewers. Even with the addition of veg, I still only got 10 skewers, each with 3 bite-size chunks of meat and 3 pieces of each veggie. If you want this recipe to produce a main dish and don't want to eat 4 of them, don't expect to stretch the meat to 20 skewers without the addition of veg, even if you use a full 2lbs of meat.

This is good but a little too sweet for us as written.  I added a little more sriracha to compensate.  While I love asian dishes this was good but did not wow me.  I let it marinade for about 8 hours.  I think if I try it again I would let it marinade overnight and use a little less honey.

I made these with chicken because we didn't have any steak in the freezer.  I only marinated them for an hour and they were delicious!  Next time I will marinate all day long and reserve some of the marinade aside for dipping.  We ate these for dinner with chinese buffet green beans, but they would be a great appetizer!

This recipe is fantastic. Probably the best Asian style marinade I've ever had. I've made this twice so far, and both times turn out great. The only change I made the second time around was I cut back on the lime juice just a little bit to 1 1/2 tablespoons because the first time it stood out a little more than I wanted.

I made this with 3 pounds of flank steak, cut into strips. Make sure you cut across the grain. I took the strips and made double the marinade, placed it cold in a vacuum marinator. I ran it a full marinate cycle, then transferred it to a sealed container and let is sit for 12 hours.

This recipe makes a fantastic appetizer. It's a little involved to prep, but that can be done well in advance of company being over, then just throw these on the grill for 3-4 minutes a side, and your done. Thanks for this great recipe!

Yum!!!  I just made this for dinner and it was great.  I was lazy and just simply marinated a flank steak for 1 1/2 days and then grilled.  AWESOME!!!

I also was looking for something to do with ground pork and turkey which I use quite often as a duo. I added more garlic, some leeks and just a touch of sage. Delectable. Believe it or not, sage and hoisin meld well. My partner said it was the best combo of pork/turkey yet.

Easy with a nice Asian flavor.  I had to sub dried ground ginger but followed the rest exactly.  The flank was not as tender as I'd like but I only marinated for 2 hours.  Next time they willl marinate for longer.  I paired this with 'Chinese Buffet' Green Beans on this site.

This beef is SO delicious and tender!!  This is the best luck I've ever had with flank steak..  I didn't know to cut it against the grain and at an angle.  I served it at an Asian-themed cocktail party with this sauce:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/oriental-dipping-sauce/detail.aspx and Lean Cuisine Thai-Style Chicken Spring rolls, broccoli-slaw (crunchier than cole slaw, doesn't taste like broccoli) with Asian-sesame dressing, and Lemon Drops and Cosmos made with Grey Goose (drink mixes from Cost Plus are outstanding).  My guests were ooing and aahing.  I LOVE the recipes from All Recipes.com, they are always so GREAT!!!

This dish was delicious!  I changed a few things.  First I only used about five drops of Sriacha instead of a whole teaspoon as it would have been too hot for my little ones.  Also I only used one pound of beef and I did not grill it.  I just cooked the marinated beef in a skillet on the stove.  I served it over brown rice and with a side salad called "Korean Salad with Sesame Dressing" from this site.  Great meal!

This recipe is delicious!! It tasted SO much better the second day when I reheated. I didn't use fresh ginger - I used powdered and had same result.  I cut the meat a little to thick so next time I will cut into smaller strips before threading on to the skewers. I wish I had set some sauce aside but they really didn't need it. Just personal preference.

I used 1 medium to large top round steak sliced very thin against the grain.  I marinated the steak for 24 hours and decided to make a 2nd batch of sauce for dipping and because my boyfriend likes sauce on his rice.  Only needed a minute or two on each side.  I served with the japanese zucchini and onions and it was a great, quick weeknight meal.

I marinated the beef for 7 hours and it came out perfect!  Extremely favorful and tender. As per my families preference, I used 2 cloves of garlic and 1-1/2 tsp ginger but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definately make again!

Very delish! I added a few large shrimp to the marinade and skewers and made veggie skewers to go along then served over a bed of brown rice! Made a great dinner!!!

I made this recipe exactly with the exception of using an indoor grill (removed the skewers). It was amazing! Will definitely use again.

I made these appetizer size on a six inch skewer to take to a party.   I left out the sesame oil as I didn't have any on hand and used a bit more lime juice and garlic.   Left it to marinade overnight.  It was fantastic.   The beef was so juicy and tender with really good flavour.   I wish I'd made more...and so did everybody else!

This was very good as a meal.  Used yellow peppers and red onions on the skewers with it.  Enjoyed the red onions better than yellow peppers.  Allowed meat to marinate over night thus making it super tender.  Will make again.

I added twice the amount of lime and I think this recipe should have less hoisin, it was too think and sweet maybe 2/3 hoisin, 1/3 soy sauce. Will try next time. Also some cilantro would be yummy here.

I made this for company and it was a hit. Then I used it again to marinate some beef to put in the freezer. Interested to see how it turns out after being frozen.

I have made this twice and really love the flavorful marinade.  The first time, I made it on skewers. The second time for an even easier prep, I marinated a whole flatiron steak, grilled it whole and sliced it thin. Still great flavor in every bite. I served with vegetable lo mein. Delicious!

I made this as close to the recipe as I could. I didn't have any sesame seeds and I used powdered ginger because I didn't have any fresh.  However, those things only could make this recipe better and it is already delicious!
I made some extra sauce for dipping but to be honest it really didn't need it. The marinade stuck to the meat very well and smelled amazing on the grill. I will definitely keep this recipe in mind for the next time we have company over to grill out. It is not hard to make but it is impressive.

This was excellent! Didn't skewer just grilled the steak on a super hot grill for a few minutes on each side. Next time I think I will double the honey and the hot pepper flakes. Would have loved it slightly sweeter and heat I can taste.

Excellent recipe, I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I marinated them for about 5 hours. The skewers alternated the beef with mushrooms, yellow and orange peppers and red onions. The skewers were served with jasmine rice and bagged Asian coleslaw from Costco.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe. I made so many everyone brought some home for leftovers ( I had 5 dinner guests).

I marinated strip steaks for the grill in this...they were absolutely delicious!  I prepared as written, but found the marinade a tad too thick and sweet, so I added a couple of tablespoons of rice wine vinegar and a splash of dry sherry.  Outstanding!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, Pat.

We made this tonight, after an unplanned longer marinade. They were yummy! Took longer to cook than advertised, and I probably should have left them on the heat even more, or cut then thinner.

I used this as Asian tacos with spring onions and grated cabbage with shiraccha/sour cream and everyone loved it! I made the marinade as is. I had some leftover tortillas so I decided on Asian/Mexican fusion! Don't be afraid to try new things! Next time I will use this as a base for a stir fry...mmmm...can't wait!

Easily a 5-star recipe!
We used a London Broil-my husband had thawed one out and we couldn't decide what to do with it.  I dug through my recipe box and found this one I'd saved months ago and decided to give it a shot.  He sliced it against the grain and made steak strips with it.  I followed the marinade recipe to a T, and just added 1 tsp of Mongolian Fire Oil, 1 tbsp of rice vinegar  and 1 tbsp of mirin, just because I had them in the cabinet and threw them in on a whim.  We marinaded the meat in a Ziploc for about 12 hours, threaded them onto skewers and grilled them up.  I stir-fried up broccoli, snow peas and carrots in sesame oil with some bottled stir-fry sauce and white rice.  Absolutely delicious!
The meat was so tender and flavorful, we almost finished the entire thing between the two of us!  It was easily one of the best Asian beef dishes I've ever had.  Highly recommend-thanks so much for sharing!

These were alright, but a touch sweet for my tastes. I would recommend cutting the hoisin and the honey back a touch.

Personally I loved it, although some people said it was a little to sweet. Entirely delicious in my opinion.
