This was very tasty. I haven't had truffles before so I am not quite sure what this oil should taste like... it added a slightly earthy musky taste, that I liked.  I do have some black truffle salt that I am going to try on the leftovers. This has flecks of real truffle in it so I will be curious to taste the difference

As the first person to review this recipe, I tried to make the recipe exactly as written. However, once it was done, it was so thin that I just had to add some cornstarch slurry. The flavour was pretty good, but could have used some herbs. The truffle oil is, in my opinion, a brilliant addition. A sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley on top would have increased the eye appeal. Thanks!

To continue my previous review (accidentally submitted early) - the second time I made this I added two potatoes and the texture was amazing. My dad said "I love cream soups"
