Easy to make and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was that I used very little of the glaze on top.  Since the filling is pretty rich, I didn't want to sweeten the fruit too much.   It turned out  great and got excellent reviews from my family!

I have made this for years and it is always a hit.  It is beautiful and very impressive visually.  No one believes hoe easy it is.
