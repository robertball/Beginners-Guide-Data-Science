I made this cake as written, subbing gluten free all purpose flour for regular all purpose. I did need to bake for about 10 extra minutes due to this substitution. The cake was nice and moist and had a good crumb. It had a light lemon flavor but we felt it could use more lemon along with some sort of lemon glaze or frosting.

Moist,easy. I brushed a glaze (boiled juice of 1 lemon plus 1/4 cup of sugar) over warm cake. Can be  served with stewed strawberries or fresh fruit on the side as garnish for a beautiful, healthy, light summer dessert.Donald

My family raved about this lemon cake.  I added a light lemon glaze I made with lemon zest, lemon juice and powdered sugar.  Delicious!

The only alteration I made was buttermilk instead of just milk. Even as I was making it, I thought there's no oil in this cake, it's going to be dry. And it was. Very dry. I made a light lemon glaze for the top, just 1/2 cup of 10X sugar, a few drops of vanilla extract and some milk along with half a lemon of zest. The cake is very dry. I only had a couple small pieces and tossed the rest. I might try this again and add half a cup of oil. The batter is quite thick  and the extra oil would thin it down a bit, but it would probably still be OK.
