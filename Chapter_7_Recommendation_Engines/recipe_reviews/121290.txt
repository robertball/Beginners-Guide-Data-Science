Overall I like the concept, but the amount of veggies was a bit much. I really wanted a tuna salad sandwich with some veggies not the other way around so I cut way back on the amounts, just eyeballing what I threw in to the mix. I used light mayo and only 1 tsp. of dijon and 2 tsp. of light sour cream. I added some garlic powder along with some salt and pepper and left out the lemon juice. I toasted some whole grain bread and topped the tuna salad with some thin sliced tomato and crisp lettuce.

I added a little more mayonnaise only because I'm out of sour cream right now and we like a little "wetter" tuna sandwich. I also added little bit of onion powder, garlic powder, and dill weed. Both my oldest son and I liked this quite a bit but my youngest didn't care for it. Great way to stretch a can of tuna, clean out our fridge a bit and get a couple more vegetables in our diet. Next time, I might cut back just a bit on the dijon. For us, it was a bit much.

I loved these.  The veggies give a nice crunch and depth of flavor to the sandwich.  I also enjoy that it sneaks veggies into my kid's meal and hubby's without them being very aware of them.  This will definitely be served again.

I made this sandwich one afternoon just to use some tuna in the pantry. It was full of fresh and new tastes! I was delighted. My little brother (10) ate 2 sandwiches! I would like to make this for guests, as well as my family, this summer. Thank you!

If you make this be aware that the mustard and mayo is way too much for the ingredients listed here. I even halved the mustard amount and mayo and it was still too much. I had to add more veggies and another two cans of tuna to save this. Mix your veggies and tuna and then add the mayo and mustard to your taste and the consistency you like your tuna salad to be. I almost think the amounts are a mistake on this recipe. I gave three stars for the idea of the veggies mixed in with tuna...just don't use the measurements listed here for the mustard and mayo. I am going to make again, but will just start with a tablespoon of mustard and then taste. My salad was yellow and that was halving the mustard, mayo, and tripling the tuna, and more of the vegetables. Sorry I hate to give a low rating, but I was lucky to have more tuna in the pantry.

This was a great tuna sandwich! I did modify it a bit and it turned out delicious.  Instead of 2/3 cup cucumber I did 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup celery, 1/2 cup red bell pepper, I also left out the carrot.  I also added a can of tuna and a little more mayo and sour cream until it was a good consistency.  It turned out great with a nice crunch and the added nutrients of the other veggies.

This was good.  I left out the whole amount of mayo and I felt the sour cream gave it enough moisture.  I loved the crunch!  I always add a slice of cheese to my tuna sandwiches.  This is a very nice recipe and itâ€™s light and tasty.  THX

Very tasty but I didn't have cukes on hand so substituted celery.  It ended up more like a salad so I added a second can of tuna, put on buns and we had two meals on this.  Very good!

As is, there's not enough meat. The flavors are there, the proportions are wrong. I'd cut down on the mayo and dijon (VERY strong dijon taste) or increase the meat. Probably both.

Much to watery i made a double batch didn't put in any cream cheese and only half the cucumber and half the lemon juice. and tasted it, added a third can of tuna and was still disappointed in the lack of tuna flavor in the sandwich.

I had some leftover chicken, so used that instead of Tuna.  Can't call it Tuna Sandwich, but followed the rest of the recipe except for the bread.  i used rolls.  Never would have thought to put cucumbers and carrots in and I was very pleased with the results.  Make a big hardy sandwich and my husband liked it very much.  Next time I will use tuna.  A great way to use leftover chicken.

Waaaaaaaay too much mustard! Should have put a little at a time until it had enuf for for our tastes. Didn't add the carrots but sub with finely sliced celery. It's ok but probably won't make again.

Never had cucumber or sour cream in my tuna sandwich but they both worked great!  I used a swirl rye bread from whole foods.  I did not peel my cucumber either and it didn't bother me one bit!  Great little sandwich!

I left out the onion and added a few herbs. Nice for a light dinner and would be great in the summer.

This is my favorite way to eat tuna these days.  I never have sour cream in the house so I have omitted it each time I have made this.

It is wonderfully light and tasty and I highly recommend it.

These were so quick and tasty.  I am really happy that I found a healthy way of serving tuna with flavor, vegetables, and not to much mayo (I really do not like it).  The mayo in this was just enough.  I will definitly be making these again!

Loved it with cucumber!  Never tried that before.  Still not willing to try carrots.  Being a guy, I never follow directions so I just put a dash of mustard and substituted the sour cream with horseraddish.  Otherwise my only addition was jalepenos, which go on everything:) and melted cheese on the bread. I can't stop eating them! Thanks

Yummm! What a great recipe! I am really excited to find something so low cal, yet filling! I found a great fat free, calorie free mayo which puts this recipe at around 100 calories without the bread. Love it!  :)

This Recipe has really great review so I thought I would try it, but my family thought it was really gross personally.  If I were ever to make it again I would double the amount of tuna and cut back on everything else.  It just didn't really taste good to us.

Wasn't sure how this would turn out without eggs and pickles, but it was great! No need for either... the cucumbers were really refreshing! I think between the green onions and the mustard it gave the sandwich just enough spice without being over powering! I also put in two cans of tuna fish, but I think that's a personal choice if one likes lots of meat or lots of veggies! Enjoy, I did!

It was alright. I'm not a big fan of cucumbers, so I think it's better without them.

This was really good! I ended up adding a second can of tuna however, as I felt that the rest of the ingredients really seemed to overpower the 1 can. Next time I'll add much less cucumber as even after that second can of tuna, the cucumber was very overpowering! I was out of green onion, so I used yellow, and I defintely used too much. Otherwise, this recipe was fantastic, a great staple for those hot days when I don't want to turn on the oven!

Delicious. I didn't use fat-free substitutes, the real the better :)
