I added sliced portobello mushrooms because I love them and used Victoria White Linen Marinara. I couldn’t find the chili paste so I used red pepper flakes and chili powder. This recipe is really easy, has a lot of flavor and makes a lot of leftovers.

Really good! I made it exactly as instructed (er.... except I did 5 cloves of garlic... hehehe) since I’ve never made anything like this before and I’m a novice cook. I’m not on keto but just a wanted something tasty and healthy. I usually don’t like cauliflower but the cauliflower rice was well incorporated and didn’t bother me at all. The only thing is that I would like to find a way to make the sauce of the mixture a little bit thicker next time (maybe slightly less water or a little bit of some kind of thickener? Or let it simmer a bit longer?). Sorry my picture isn’t great, the red plates we have don’t make food the most photogenic. Anyway it was delicious and I’d definitely make it again even if I can’t thicken it.
