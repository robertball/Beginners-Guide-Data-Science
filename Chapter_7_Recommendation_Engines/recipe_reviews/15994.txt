I made this pie (actually made two of them) for a Christmas party, entertained some friends with the leftovers the next day, and took the rest to the office, and it was a big hit with everyone!!  Reading the other reviews , I made the following suggested modifications:  used deep dish pie crust, the amount of filling turned out just right that way; cut down bourbon to 2 tbs and sugar to 3/4 cup; and laid down a single layer of chocolate chips at the bottom of the crust (did not measure, it was maybe 2 oz of chips) instead of mixing them in the filling.  This was the first pecan pie I ever made, and I make desserts rarely, but this was easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  If you want a nice pecan pie with a twist (that is not overpowering), try this one.

this is my recipe that I have been making for at least 15 years for Thanksgiving & Christmas...I have changed it slightly to make it the way we really love. 3/4c sugar instead of of 1c, 2  tbsp bourbon instead of 1/4c and 1/2c choc chips instead of 6 oz.  Make it in a DEEP pie dish, as this makes a lot of filling!! Thanksgiving isn't Thanksgiving for me without this pie.

I am asked to make this for every holiday! 
I put the chocolate chips in the pie shell prior to adding the mixture so that they don't melt. Prior to this, they seemed to make one big chocolate glob - adding them first took care of this problem. I also use a little less bourbon so it doesn't overpower the other flavors.

This is a DECADENT pie! Like many other reviewers, I found it too chocolatey the first time I made it. To remedy it the second time:
1)I used less chocolate chips
2) melted them beforehand
3) poured the melted chips into a deep dish pie shell, and put the pie shell back in the freezer for an hour before I made the actual pie. 
It came out great with just a little layer of chocolate at the bottom!  Also like many reviewers I used Kahlua instead of Bourbon. DELISH! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Like Jay in Tennessee, I did push my Grandmother down the stairs for the last piece of this pie!  Two good things came out of this.  The pie was the best hit ever this holiday season, and Grandma's new hips are better than the original!  She ended up thanking me!

The pie was delicious.  The only problem I ran into was that the recipie makes a lot of filling -- I used a frozen, ready-made 9" pie crust and it was enough for 2 pies!

Incredible! I wanted something different this year for Thanksgiving and this was it!
I used Kahlua instead of Bourbon, and it was just incredible. I think next time I will lower the amount of chocolate chips, as they are a little overpowering, but otherwise the perfect pie!

I've made this pie twice in as many days. The first was consumed on Thanksgiving day and my son begged for another one today.  If you are using a standard Pyrex or metal pie pan you will be able to use all but about a half cup of the filling, give or take.  Just salvage the pecans and toss the excess.  Like others I have reduced the sugar and the amount of chips, which I also sprinkled in the bottom of the pan before filling.  I agree that dark chocolate chips are the way to go and that using the entire amount of chocolate would be overkill.  Used the full amount of bourbon both times and did not find it overwhelming at all.  Perhaps it depends on the quality of bourbon used.  In fact, you taste only a hint of bourbon under the chocolate which sets this apart from the typical peacan pie.  Outstanding!

This pecan pie is overwhelmed by the bourbon and chocolate and has more of a custard consistency.  Recipe almost makes enough filling for 2 pies if using a frozen 9" pie shell.

I've been using this recipe since 2002.  It always comes out perfect and everyone loves it.  Just remember not to double it, pre-cook your pie shell for a carmelized effect, beat the eggs until just barely frothy, and always wrap your crust

I didn't really like the bourbon, I think next time I will leave it out.  It was too strong.  And it is more of a chocolate pie than a pecan pie.  But the more we ate it, the more we liked it.  We think it is best with vanilla ice cream.  Great pie for chocoholics!!

This is on of the best ones i have tried.  I'm a pastry chef for a doubletree hotel and use this for pies and also to make smaller individual tarts.  I use jack daniels.

I loved this and so did everyone at Thanksgiving dinner. I used dark chocolate chunks instead of the chips and only sprinkled a few on the bottom and after adding the filling I dotted a few on the top, made a beautiful presentation. And to everyone who said there was too much bourbon...you must have been tasting the raw filling, because I did and was worried that it would be too strong...but after baking it cooked out the alcohol and left just the perfect hint of bourbon flavor. I will definitely be making one for Christmas as well!!!

This was my first attempt at making a pie and this was perfect. Please note this recipe fills TWO 9 inch shells. I used the frozen Pillsbury kind and it was just right. Also, I didn't have bourbon so I used a mini bottle of Bailey's caramel liqueur instead. One more thing: I used the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled maybe 2 ounces of the chocolate chips on the crust instead of mixing them in and it was a great balance. Plus, adding more pecans (an extra 1/2 cup) brought it all together. Everyone loved this pie!

This pie has certified me into a mini-Martha Stewart. This pie was incredible I followed others' advice with my own twist. I put some chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie and left the rest to melt in the mixture. I used 3/4 cup dark brown sugar instead of white. I used deep dish 9" pans and still had some mixture left over which I froze and made an even better pie later. I even made smaller individual pies for a guest who was a recovering alcoholic and he loved it without the bourbon as well. I also decorated the top of the pie with whole pecans. I'm getting so many requests for this pie it's crazy. GREAT recipe!!!

Read the other reviews if you want, but this recipe is great, as-is. I would however recommend putting the chocolate chips in the pie shell before poring the filling in, they do melt. I think a lot of reviewers that complain about the amount of filling being too much, are using an insufficient pie plate. There are many different sizes out there folks! The shallow ones are for thin pies like pumpkin pie, NOT this pie! I use a pyrex pie dish they currently sell for only 5 bucks, its the one with the scallop edges you can find anywhere. It is PERFECT! Bake 50 minutes, in the bottom 1/3 of your oven and you will be impressing everyone who is lucky enough to get a slice. This is a great recipe and I be adding it to my line-up! I use Jack Daniels® at the full 1/4 cup recommended.

I won a cooking contest at work with this recipe!

I follow the recipe more or less as written, with the following tweaks...  I use a deep dish pie pan, I pour half a bag of chips onto the bottom of the pie crust, followed by half a pound of pecan halves, then pour the liquid mixture over that rather than mixing them all together.

My dad is a pecan pie fanatic but I made this for him and my husband for dessert for an impromptu dinner I made.  I read all the reviews and about the sweetness of it.  Since bourbon is in the recipe I substituted dark corn syrup to bring out the bourbon flavor more.  It was absolutely delicious.  I will make it again and again.

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it for Thanksging and it was a real hit.  The bourbon flavor gets stronger each day if you have left-overs, so you may want to decrease it a little.

I learned from Annie Overboe way back that the way to make a pecan pie really amazing is to double the pecans because in most the goop to nut ratio is too high. I only added an extra half cup to this recipe because with all the chocolate and bourbon in the goop I knew the goop would be the best part of it. Served it just a little warm with home made vanilla ice cream on the side and a whipped cream bonnet. It was perfect for Fat Tuesday...totally over the top. I let the butter/sugar/syrup mixture cool enough to not cook the eggs but still warm enough to melt the chocolate. Unlike most people here I used all the booze and all the chocolate and all the sugar this recipe called for and it was fantastic!!!! IMHO you can never have too much chocolate or booze in a dessert. My husband ate all his and then started in on what was left on our daughter's plate. I used some really nice old Bushmill's. Maybe that's why it went down so smooth. Makes one nice sized pie, filled to the brim if you use a pyrex pie plate and make your own crust.

This pie was amazing! I doubled the recipe because I needed 2 pies for a work pot luck. I used Makers Mark which really made the flavors wake up, and I poured a 12 oz bag of Toll House semi sweet chips into my melted butter mixture. I have had Chocolate Pecan Pie disasters in the past. I find that this doesn't leave you with the hit or miss of flavor thing that has plagued my pies in the past. I used jumbo eggs which has always been a preference. I did end up making an extra pie crust and had 3 pies! I am so glad that I did too! This pie was the hit of the pot luck and I now have everyone convinced that I am quite the Gourmand! This is a keeper!

I can describe this pie in two words: rich and sinful. I use 1/2 cup of Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips that I sprinkle directly onto the crust then I pour the filling over the chocolate. This recipe make enough filling for one deep dish or two standard pies. This is one pie you will make over and over.

This is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  My husband and I have made this twice now.  Minor changes to suit our taste are doubling the amount of pecans to 2 cups, increasing the bourbon to 1/2 cup and using 70% or more dark chocolate, which we melted and lined along the bottom and sides of the pie shell.  We baked this on a Sunday night, and cleaned the pan on Wednesday, a dangerously delicious treat we are limiting ourselves to 1 every 1.5 months.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

My family and I thought this recipe was GREAT! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there are a few improvments that I will make next time.

To me it was WAY too chocolatey and it had WAY too much bourbon in it. It had a VERY strong taste of Chocolate and Bourbon. Next time, I will just put a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom like others suggested and will cut the bourbon in half. Also, like others said, this made a LOT of filling. It filled up two 9 inch pie shells to the brink of spilling over. I am just glad I bought two just in case. It was nice to have an extra pie though. ;)

Oh, and I also added Praline Pecans on top as my part of decorating it. The sweet and saltiness of the Praline Pecans really helped to balance out the excess bourbon taste. It was wonderful.

I will definitely be making this again at Christmas. It was really easy to make and was REALLY good. Thank you for giving me my new holiday dessert recipe!

I've made hundreds of pecan pies, and this is the best. Use good quality chocolate for the best texture. I sometimes substitute Kalua for the Bourbon. Both ways are fantastic!

Don't change a thing...unbelievable.  We don't drink bourbon, so I bought 18 yr single barrel.  I figured cooking is the only time I'll use it, so spending a bit more on the good stuff made sense.  I think using the best ingredients you can afford makes all the difference.  Yummy!

Now it's 10 years later and we drink bourbon all the time!  I use cheap stuff in this pie, but no one knows.  It is so delicious, the men in my family think I'm genius!

This year was the family's 5th annual thanksgiving pie competition. The ladies in the family and all who would like to enter, bake a pie and following the traditional turkey dinner would have the men taste and judge the various pies. This year I intended to win! I thought a different type of pie would be a great start. I can say not only did my pie instantly disappear, I also won this year! Thanks Anita, and if your looking for reccomendations to go with this recipe, it's a great one. That extra bit of Bourbon really makes the pie. I also tried this recipe without the chocolate, I personally like it even better that way!

OMG this pie is amazing, it was the only one that didn't have any left by thanksgiving night.  I made it just as is except for visual effect I topped it with whole toasted pecans in a circular pattern.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I used a little less than the ¼ c of Bourbon, used dark corn syrup instead of light and ¼ c brown sugar/ ¾ c white sugar (totaling 1 c).  As others have suggested, press the chocolate into the pie crust instead of adding it to the pecan mixture.  I used a 10 inch pie plate (w/ the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site) since so many reviewers wrote they had extra filling left over.  You won’t regret making this dessert.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Delicious!!!

The surface of the finished pie was not very appealing.  Next time, I'd probably consider melting milk and white chocolate and drizzling it over the top!

This is a great recipe that I will definately be using again! I have never put bourbon in pecan pies before and it was a nice surprise. If I made any change it would be to use less chocolate chips. It was very chocolatey!!!

I followed the suggestion of someone else and just spread the chocolate chips in the bottom of the crust.  I found the chocolate to be too overwhelming and I couldn't taste the rest of the pie.  I will definitely make it again, but I think I will leave out the chocolate....

I have been looking for a recipe which copies the wonderful "Derby Pie" a friend of my family makes. Her derby pie is like a pecan pie with chocolate chunks. If you follow this receipe, the chocolate chips will melt, so the sauce actually becomes a chocolatey syrup.  I think next time I will let my sugar mixture cool more and add larger chunks of chocolate to keep them from melting down. It was still tasty though!

This pie was pretty good.  I mean how can you go too wrong with chocolate and pecans.  It tasted a little pale and custardy in the middle.  It's probably a matter of taste but I like my pecan pie a little darker and thicker.  The pecans on the top tasted really good but I think I'll keep searching for the ultimate pecan pie.

Fantastic! I reduced the bourbon to 2 tbsp, and that amount provided the perfect flavor. I used chocolate chip "chunks" and pressed them slightly into the crust to create a layer of chocolate. Delicious! A new pecan pie favorite!

This was very good, I used large bittersweet chocolate chips (all I had) which was a mistake, the pie was yummy but then you'd bite into a big cold chunk of hard chocolate.  I ended up digging them out while eating the otherwise awesome pie.  If I make again w/chocolate chips I may melt the chocolate and put a layer onto the bottom instead, I didn't like the chip texture.  It doesn't really need the chocolate however, the pie was awesome, thanks!

I wish I could rate this with more stars, it definately deserves it. I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving and this pie was a definate show-stopper. One of the guests at dinner commented that it was like the creamiest fudge he ever had and it was in a pie shell to boot. I did not change one thing on this recipe other than to decorate the top of the pie with pecan halves. This is definately worth making, absolutely delicious as written with no substitutions whatsoever! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This pie was amazing! By far the favorite desert at my Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used Kahlua instead of bourbon and just covered the bottom of the pie shell with chocolate chips before I poured the mixture in. Delecious!

I have been making this for a number of years now and have tried making it many different ways. First of all, I always use a deep dish pie pan. I use dark corn syrup and cut the sugar down to 3/4c. To cut down on the "alcohol" taste while still maintaining the bourbon flavor, I add the bourbon to the butter/corn syrup/sugar mixture and cook it with that. Mixing the chocolate in with the warm ingredients gives it a good texture. Wonderful pie!!!!

1st Attempt:  I layered the chocolate on the bottom, as suggested.  I used a deep dish pie crust and cut the bourbon in half, and it was still too much filling.  A lot of the pecan mix bubbled out, leaving a little pecan over a lot of chocolate. Done in 45 minutes.   2nd attempt: Used the full 1/4 cup bourbon and only used about 3oz of chocolate.  Filled to the brim but didn't bubble over.  Better but now not chocolatey enough...will keep playing with the measurements, and will lower the oven temp to keep crust from burning before the filling sets.

This was a mighty tasty & mighty easy pie.  I loved it warm, husband preferred it cold.  Either was was nice.  It was a bit rich, so next time I will probably add fewer chocolate chips & maybe melt them before hand and add them to the bottom of the pie.  I would also like to try dark chocolate to see if that doesn't cut out some of the sweetness. 
I agree with other reviews, though, die hard pecan pie fans probably won't love it.

Very good!  I found that a single recipe can make 2 thin pies or a very full deep dish pie.  Warning: adding just a little more bourbon than called for made it too strong.  Also great without the chocolate.  Great recipe!

My advice for those who have commented negatively on the "overwhelming" bourbon or chocolate flavors, fix a plain pecan pie! This pie is wonderful and perfectly blends the flavors of the bourbon, chocolate and pecans...hence the name. I'm a Kentucky gal, and we do love our bourbon. In fact, there's no such thing as too much bourbon flavoring, so I add a bit more than the recipe calls for. (Make sure it's Kentucky bourbon or it's not the real thing!) My friends and family request this pie often. It's PERFECT! It does make 2 9-inch pies or 1 deep dish 9-inch pie.

This is a HUGE hit...Have made 5 within the past two weeks, due to requests!  
A couple of personalizations...use 3 whole eggs, plus 2 yokes. 
 Also, add just a pinch of Chile de Arbol powder to syrup...no heat, but it really adds a great zip "binder" for the sweet & chocolate
I do put the chocolate & pecans on the bottom of the crust.
Wonderful, and...easy as pie!

First pecan pie attempt and it turned out beautifully.  Rave reviews from family over the Holidays.  Bourbon was a definite flavor factor, might try it with a little less next time.

I LOVE this pie- which is saying something because pie is definitely not my dessert of choice.  It may sound a little odd, but I add coconut to it.  It reminds me of a pie I had years ago at a plantation restaurant I visited in Louisiana.

AMAZING!! I followed the advice of a few previous reviewers and used Kahlua instead of bourbon and it was unbelievable! I will definitely be making these again-in fact I am making two for Christmas-and though I doubt there will be, I am really hoping there is some left over for me to bring home :-)

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving and Christmas for three years now. It's a favorite in our family.  I've used both bourbon and whiskey.  I often mix dark and milk chocolate chips.  The recipe is great as written - the only variation depends on the type of alcohol.  Strong whiskeys and bourbons (like Jack Daniels) need to be cut back to 3 tbls.  Smoother, lighter alcohol (like Gentleman Jack) as written.

This was my first pecan pie. I looked over a few pecan pie recipes on allrecipes and decided on this one for July 4th celebration, which turned out to be a great decision! I made my own crust and replaced bourbon with kahlua. I also let the pie sit in the oven for an additional 15-20 minutes after cooking it for 50 minutes. The consistency of the filling was perfect. Everybody loved it, thank you for the recipe..

I just didn't swirl the chocolate chips into the pan good enough. Some pieces were very chocolaty and some tasted like a standard pie.

I made this for Easter and everyone liked it the taste combo of the bourbon/chocolate and pecans was a good one. I would prefer however to find a recipe that is more fudge/chocolate like, this recipe is more of a gooey pie.

My friends from Louisville, KY call this "Derby Pie".  It's a rich, delicious and easy to make pie that is the rave anywhere I make it.  I always have it for the holidays.  I started using Orange Extract instead of Vanilla and WOW.  It was amazing.

This pie is fabulous. But... I now make it with Kahlua instead of bourbon. I was out of bourbon and tried the subtitution--now I always the Kahlua.

Things I love--Bourbon, Pecans, Chocolate.  To combine them all is divine. I did sprinkle the chocolate, not mix it, but this is just about perfect.  To the reader who complained of a thin custard and separated pecans....congratulations!!! You just made a pecan pie.  That's how it is supposed to be.

I made this pie for a friend's wedding and it was a huge hit!  I tweaked the recipe to add a pinch of cayenne pepper just to warm up and round out the chocolate.  It really did the trick.  Make your own crust for this one, a savory butter crust is just the right touch.

I made this in a 10 inch tart pan and changed the amount of bourbon to 2 Tablespoons.  It was a fantastic pie and a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!  The tart pan worked out really well...pretty presentation, plus it's quite rich, so it was nice to be able to slice nice, thin slices after a big heavy meal. (Plus, you know everyone wants more than once dessert at Thanksgiving!)  This will be my go-to pecan pie recipe from now on!

I have made this for my father-in-law twice now. I used Jim Beam. There was too much filling, so a deep dish crust might work better. The chocolate does sink to the bottom, but it was tasty. I am not a pecan pie fan, but this was good!

This pie turned out great for me! I cut the bourbon by half and left everything the same. It was rated best of 10 pies at one get to together (i gave it as a gift) and there wasnt any left at my Thanksgiving! However there were two completely untouched pumpkin and cherry pies! It was great for people who dont regularly like pecan pies as well. This will be a new addition to our holidays!

Did not use bourbon... it still tasted great! My one peacan pie tip.  My peacan pies use to always come out runny.  So I now bake my peacan pie the last thing for the night. When the cook time is up, I turn off the oven and leave the pie in there.  The next morning I take the pie out and it is always perfect.

Wow!  This will be a Holiday staple at our house.  I took the advice of other reviews and put the chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie instead of mixing them in with the syrup.  One of our guests loved "the little chocolate morsels."  I also used less chips and less sugar; half less of each.

Absolutely delicious without any changes to the recipe.  Even with a deep-dish crust, I had too much filling, so here's how I solved that.  I poured the extra filling into a casserole dish, broke an extra store-bought crust into pieces and stirred them in.  After baking it alongside the pie, I scooped it into bowls and topped it with ice cream.  Yummy!  And I still had a whole pie to take to our Thanksgiving dinner!

Very yummy, extremely easy and everyone loved it.  The bourbon flavor was great and not over-powering at all.  I'm not a big fan of pecans, so I put them in a food processor to chop them up as much as possible and it turned out great!

Great recipe!  It was great just the way it is written, but VERY sweet.  Next time I may use less chocolate chips.
I used a deep dish 9" frozen pie crust, and it was just the right size.

This is the ultimate pie for any Thanksgiving dinner!! I made it last year (and what month are we in? August) and I am already looking forward to making it this year for my family and soon to be inlaws. Wouldn't change a thing about the prep for this recipe, I would also recommend "The double layer Pumpkin Cheesecake" by S. Phillips. Both make for a lovely selection at the desert table. Enjoy, I know I will :)

I've made this recipt a dozen time and it's always a hit. Note: I've never made it with bourbon however - I always use Appleton Jamaican Rum instead.

Every year I make two pies for Thanksgiving.  After a half decade of this tradition, this pie has gotten the most raves.  And, even better, I think it rocks.

This is the perfect pie!  It's simple to make and the results are superb!  The recipe combines the perfect ratio of chocolate, pecans and bourbon to create a dessert that no one has been able to pass up!!!  Thanks!!

Better than my last attempt with a different recipe. Next time: I need to scale up the filing for a deep 9" deep dish pie. Needed a bit more to fill my homemade crust. I need to let the filling cool a bit more before mixing with the egg mixture. It cooked a bit and yielded a slightly scrambled egg texture in the warm pie. I have yet to try it cold. It might get better but half pie is gone already! It was that good and I made it as written.

This recipe was ok and easy to make. I followed it exactly with the exception of putting the chocolate chips on the crust and I used a few more pecans than called for.  My husband and his friend (both bourbon lovers) really liked this which is why I gave this four stars vs three. Being from Georgia and a pecan pie purist, I wouldn't make this again as written. I think i may try adding the bourbon to my standard pecan pie recipe because I think the guys really liked the addition. The chocolate and kind of "custardy" filling of this recipe just didn't work for me though and is not worth repeating.

Good recipe. I liked it but those who don't like chocolate didn't. I did take someone's advice on here and just put the chocolate chips along the crust so it wasn't a big chocolate glob. Going to deliver this pie to my dad tonight and that's the real test.

I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I also reduced the bourbon to 2 tablespoons....at a 1/4 cup it is just too strong.  Lastly, I use a handful of dark chocolate chips. This way way, you get a pecan pie with a hint of chocolate rather than a chocolate pie with a hint of pecan.  The family loves it.

I made this pie for my best friend's birthday. Chocolate pecan pie is her favorite since she visited New Orleans. She and the guests absolutely loved it! She did say it was the best pecan pie she ever had! I did use the other reviewer's suggestions, using the 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 tblsps of Kahula, and I laid the chips in the pie shell first. I took 2 pie shells, rolled them together and used a pyrex pie plate. There was a lot of filling and one shell wouldnt have been enough, next time I will buy a deep dish shell. I served the pie with Haagen Das vanilla ice cream.

Fantastic pie!  I followed the lead of other reviewers by swapping Cinnamon Spice Kahlua for bourbon.  I only used 2 TBSP vs. 1/4 cup.  I also melted the 6 oz of chocolate and spread it out in the bottom of the pie crust before pouring in the pecan mixture.  It's to die for!

Super easy and delicious! Be sure you cook it long enough to get the center done, otherwise you may have unmelted chocolate in the center.

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used just 3/4 c. sugar and 2 tblsp of bourbon.  I also put enough chocolate chips at the bottom of the pie crust just to cover it and that was perfect!  I can't wait to make this pie again!  Divinve!!!

First time making a pecan pie with chocolate in it. It turned out very good although rather rich. I followed advice of others and added chocolate chips to pie crust the poured in pecan mixture.

Tried this out for Thanksgiving this year...It was a hit everyone loved it. I followed the tips that said 2 tbsp of bourbon, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 3/4 cup of sugar. Easy to make and try making your own crust I did and I will diffentlly make it again and again.

This pie was delicious!! I left out the bourbon since I made it for a church function. I also followed other reviewers' suggestion and added 2-3 oz chocolate chips as a bottom layer instead of inside the batter. It fit perfectly in a deep dish pie plate and baked beautifully on the 2nd to lowest rack without burning the top or bottom. Next time, I will make a homemade crust using the "Irresistible Pecan Pie" recipe since it is better than the frozen type. Can't wait to make again and try the bourbon version!

I make four each year for a bigtime Derby party on Cape Cod.  I bake the pie shell (made with No Roll Canola oil recipe) with the mini chocolate chips at 450 for 8 minutes.  Melts the chocolate before the mixture goes in and sets the No Roll crust.  Individually place each pecan on top and make a little design. Then bake the pie at 325 for 55 mins.  You'll get a winner.

This pie is hit or miss depending on your guests tastes.  I used about 3/4 the amount of bourbon the recipe called for and to me the bourbon taste was overpowering.  Other guests loved it and thought it was the perfect ratio.  Everyone thought the addition of chocolate was great (I put it on the bottom of the crust as most reviews suggested and I would also recommend that).  Next time I will make this pie as is except omitting the bourbon and I think it will be just perfect, or the kahlua suggestion others mentioned sounds yummy too!

loved this- only change was to put a single layer of choc chips in the crust before the filling. my husband thought the bourbon was a little powerful, but I didn't. the second time I made this I halved the bourbon and he still complained and I didn't think it was strong enough. A matter of personal taste. Next pie gets the full amount!

I don't like pecans but I made this for an office holiday party and it was a huge hit.  There were FIVE pies, TWO pecan and this one was gone before all the others and in about an hour.  So yeah, I guess it was that good.

This was good. Super easy to make too. The only modification I made was to put the chocolate chips on the bottom as suggested by several others. Be prepared, it is really sweet. Also, because I like bourbon and chocolate and pecans I thought I'd love this. The bourbon was ok but seriously noticeable(I used Woodford Reserve). Many other reviewers mentioned they omitted the bourbon or replaced with Kahlua. I think I might try the caramel Bailey's next time, for a sweet, nutty, chocolately, caramel pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and highly recommend you use a DEEP dish pie crust. I found it was too rich with the chocolate added but the bourbon added a really nice flavor to the pie!! I am in the process of making this pie again without the chocolate and will see how well it tastes without it. Im sure it will be fabulous!! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

This is the first time that I have tried to make a pecan pie, it is so easy and looks great when it is done.  I substituted ameretto for the burbon, and put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust.  Will be making this again and again for Thanksgiving, as well as our church bazzar.

I made this pie the other day as a test run for Thanxgiving as I have never made pecan pie before. I followed suggestions to minimize the bourbon and sugar, and put a layer of chocolate chips on the bottom instead of mix it in. I also drizzled some dark chocolate across the top for presentation and added taste. This recipe makes a lot of filling, so next time I'm going to try a deep dish crust, but it was soo yummy with the graham crust I used and everyone loved it. It was announced as a must for this upcoming holiday. Thanks!

Love, love LOVE this pie!  I made some minor adjustments per other people's reviews.  I used 3 Tablespoons of Bourbon, and I thought it could have used a little more (I'm a fan of bourbon).  It was VERY rich, chocolate-y and decadent.  I was able to make 2 9-inch standard pies with this recipe (I don't own a deep dish pie pan).  I can already tell that I will be making this again and again.

I made these and they were a huge hit! RICH and decadent.  Between the Bourbon, Corn Syrup and Chocolate Chips you'll want to veg after having this (before hitting the tread mill.)

my husband doesn't like pecan pie, but he liked this recipe... co-workers all wanted the recipe. I put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the crust before I poured the "custard" in. Also put in extra chopped pecans to keep it more nutty/less custardy. Thanks!

AWESOME!  the pan got scraped at thanksgiving and everyone was asking for the recipe and asking why I didn't bring 2.  It was also really easy to make and a nice twist on the plain ole' pecan pie. Like others have said, a deep dish pie crust is perfect.  and put the chocolate chips in a single layer of the pie crust instead of mixing them in.  I used a couple splashes of Kahlua instead of bourbon.

If there was a sixth star I would have given it! Awesome, wonderful, great, incredible! So simple and easy to make and was an absolute hit.  Followed the advice of the other reviewers:   1-used deep dish pie crust, worked perfectly   2-cut down bourbon to 2 tbs (will use more next time)   3-cut sugar to 3/4 cup   4-laid down a single layer of chocolate chips at the bottom of the crust (did not measure, just a single layer covering the crust bottom) instead of mixing them in the filling.

Awesome! This has become a family favorite. I don't chop the pecans and increased the amount to 1 1/2 cups+.  Also use Jack Daniels and put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie rather than stir them in.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  My husband and one of my sons loved it, but I found the chocolate overwhelming to the point that you couldn't taste the bourbon at all.  It is ultra-rich and a good option if you need to satify a chocoholic but want to do a nut pie.

I love, love, LOVE this pie!  I make this every Thanksgiving and sometimes just for the heck of it!  It does make enough for 2 deep dish pies so be prepared!  After a couple days (if there's some left) it firms up almost like a brownie, delicious! Definitely make this if you like pecan pie and want a different twist!

This was an excellent recipe. I followed the recommendations of many reviewers and cut back on the bourbon. I do not recommend cutting back on the chocolate chips, as others recommended. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do not mix the chocolate chips into the pie mixture, but rather line the bottom of your pie with them before pouring in the filling. I did not follow this recommendation, and I should have. It will make a huge difference. Otherwise, the chocolate chips melt slightly when you mix them into the filling and WILL NOT be evenly distributed throughout your pie.

This pie was not only beautiful, but it tasted so good! I think next time I will mix the chocolate into the butter mixture rather than lay the chips on the bottom of the pan, as other reviewers suggested. Once the pie cooled, the inside didn't look appetizing. But, everything else was perfect--and I thought the amount of bourbon was great (any less and there wouldn't be as much taste).

I've used this recipe 4 times already!  If you times it by 1.5, it makes the PERFECT amount for 2 deep dish pies. I used Kahlua instead of bourbon and got rave reviews from family, friends and coworkers. The first time, I made it exactly like directions (with Kahlua exception) and it was too chocolatey, so the next few times, I used 1/2 and then 1/3 the chocolate... the best was with the least chocolate, although I do think the chocolate adds/accentuates flavor, so don't leave it out altogether. Overall, an EXCELLENT recipe - I will use over and over and over!

WOW! Made 2 & gave one away Wed. night before Thanksgiving. They called the next day to say it was gone before noon on Thanksgiving Day! My husband just finished the one I kept and has been asking me to make more! I used the called for amounts of everything but I did use some of the choc chips to line the crust and I soaked the whole pecans that I used to decorate the top in a little bourbon. Super easy and just plain delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I served this last night and people raved about it.
Per some reviewers suggestions, I cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup; and used a heaping 1/2 of chocolate morsels.  Since I love the bourbon flavor, I used the full amount.
I served it with a scoop of bourbon flavored whipped cream on each slice.
Fantastic recipe - not only will I make this again, but people were requesting that I make it again for upcoming parties.
Thanks!

I followed the suggestion of using only about half the bourbon, suggested by some of the reviews, and this turned out great -- not quite as sticky sweet as traditional pecan pie.

Delicious!  We took previous reviewers' advice and halved the bourbon and layered the chocolate chips on the bottom.  Got rave reviews all around and will definitely make in the future.

The bourbon was quite overwhelming in this recipe. I don't drink or care for bourbon, so I thought I may not care for it. Unfortunately, no one liked it at Thanksgiving (even those who drink), and they weren't thrilled that they didn't have a pecan pie. I may try again without the bourbon sometime.

Everyone raved it was delicious. Only thing I did differently was what others had recommended and put the chocolate chips and pecans in bottom of shell, then poured mixture over them.  Easy, yummy and fattening, but who cares once a year?!

This was a very easy recipe to follow for my first time as a pecan pie maker! Only comment I have is... this is very rich, even w/o the chocolate so... I will use less chips next time, like 1/2 (only 3 ozs!) the amount. It was too chocolately & not enough pecans! Great otherwise :)

This was a great twist on pecan pie - and I will make again!  Next time - I may try decreasing the bourbon by a tad, as it was overpowering.  BUT this could also be because I let the pie sit for about 15 minutes before baking (poor timing with other dishes) and it could have separated out a bit.

Delicious! Made enough for 2 pies, I followed the recipe exactly. It's very rich, but if you've got a glass of milk, it's perfect. Oh, and I used whiskey b/c there was some discrepency among family members whether or not whiskey and bourbon was the same. I'm still not sure, but this recipe is great!

I think this would have been really good if I hadn't screwed it up.  I made a grahm cracker crust and it mixed up with the pie during baking.  I think I over cooked it too.  Because the crust mixed you can imagine how it stuck.  I have to kind of spoon it out, but it tastes great.

Great tasting pie, but the chocolate definitely overwhelms the pecan flavor.  If you are a classic pecan pie lover (like my husband), you're probably better off with another pie.  If you are looking for a twist on pecan pie, you will love this recipe.

Very good - especially if you like bourbon.  I made this for a family function and everyone liked it.  I'd cut back on the chocolate next time.

I altered the recipe a bit.  I ended up liking it much better with less chocolate and bourbon.  I cut both in half.  I think the pie would be even better with less.  It got rave reviews.  I will definatly make it again.

I have used Anita's recipe several times, from holidays to pitch-ins.  A few times, the pie didn't make it out of the house (too good to share!) and I had to make a new pie.  Thank goodness this recipe is so easy!  It is always a big hit, especially from the chocolate addicts in my family.  I had looked for this recipe before; glad to have found it.  Thanks Anita!

Surprised my husband with this today since chocolate pecan pie is his favorite.  I made this according to the recipe ingredients however I melted the chocolate chips with the butter and sugar.  I used a deep dish frozen pie shell and baked it first.  Covered the edges with foil during baking as recommended by another reviewer.  It was delicious!  I didn't find the chocolate or bourbon to be overpowering and everything seemed well balanced.  I will make it again for the holidays.

My first attempt making a pecan pie and the pie turned out very good only it was not the pecan pie I was aiming to make. If you follow this recipe you will have more than enough filling to make 1 pie. I ended up having enough filling left over to fill 6 small single serving crusts. Next time I may just make two pies or use a deep dish crust.
Another detail I want to point out is that the picture associated with this recipe shows pecan halves in the filling. The recipe calls for chopped pecans so where do the pecan halves come into play? Next time I will use a combination of chopped pecans and halves to make the filling.
I used a graham cracker crust which I would use again.
I only used 2TBS of whiskey, but next time I'd use more.
I added the chocolate chips to the warm syrup mix which worked out well. Most of the chocolate chips melted and result was a super chocolatey gooey filling. 
Can't wait to make it and eat it again.

Really delicious pie.  A good bourbon will do you well.  Don't skimp and go cheap.  Served with a dollop of fresh whip cream.  Never knew how much I like bourbon until I made this pie.  Followed recipe, had no problems whatsoever.

I'm writing this review as I'm savoring each rich and flavorful bite!    I used my Mom's No Roll Pie Crust that won me first place in a contest with a cherry pie ( 1 1/4 C flour, 3 TBSP sugar, 1 TBSP milk and 1/2 C . oil; roll into a ball then press into pan - yummy and flaky!) I used dark choc bar melted in double broiler, covered bottom and sides of unbaked crust, 1 cup fine chopped pecans and 3/4 C sugar in the mixture with only 2 TBSP of bourbon. No leftover mixture,  filling up 1 (9 in) glass pie pan and no spillover!   It's better after chilled and even better then next day. So easy to make!   Each ingredient complements  each other without being over powering!  My husband had 2 pieces after I made the Charleston Shrimp and Grits from this website!    OMG!   Another awesome recipe!   This pie just melts in your mouth and will make you push everyone out of the way to get the last piece, haha. It's that good!   Enjoy :).  Thank you for sharing!

My former boss will KILL me if he finds out I revealed some of his tricks of the trade........A few changes I would recommend: 
1) do not add butter to corn syrup mixture and do not add chocolate chips as is. INSTEAD: In a double boiler melt butter down. Add chocolate chips to this and melt them down stirring constantly. DO NOT BURN/overcook THE CHOCOLATE. AFTER you temper the egg mixture with the corn syrup and sugar mixture (make sure sugar is completely dissolved) use a rubber spatula to add the chocolate/butter mixture. whisk lightly until homogeneous. 
2) fork/score the pie bottoms
3) add a heaping tablespoon of raisins to the pie shell distributing evenly (trust me)...i know it sounds weird. You can't taste them but the tartness takes a bit of the edge off of the sweetness
4) Add pecans directly to the pie shell with raisins in it then pour the rest of the mixture over them oh and don't use pecan pieces use whole pecans. Some pieces are fine.
5) this is almost MOST important use a rubber spatula to DUNK pecans under the surface of the mixture if there are any dry spots. This will give the pie a GORGEOUS sheen and will prevent dry spots on the pecans and "candy" them. 
6) More a suggestion. Fill pies (recipe should make enough for 2 with 9in shells) on a baking sheet with a lip and cook them on it. Carefully rotate pies half way through cooking.

If you use these suggestions you will NOT be disappointed. This method led to an award winning pie.

Happy baking!

YUM! I used Kalua instead of bourbon as another poster did and had to bake the pie for almost 1-1/2hrs....sooooo good and rich! A small piece goes a long way, would be wonderful with vanilla ice cream! This is a keeper, will DEFINITELY make again!

Wow! I made this for a friend. I read all of the reviews in advance and did put the ghirardelli chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust instead of stirring them into the filling. Also I omitted the white sugar and used only 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar instead. One thing that I didn't like about pecan pie in the past was the overwhelming sweetness. This was just perfect. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of pecan halves to decorate the top of the pie. Beautiful. I wish that I had taken a picture. It looked like it came from a magazine but I made it myself! This will be a holiday favorite for many years to come.

Aaaaamazing pie. Cut back on the bourbon to 2 T and melted the choc and spread on pie crust instead of mixing the chips into the filling. Loved it!

I made two of these… both are gone.  A few changes that I made:
1. I actually grated Hershey Kisses and lined the flakes on the bottom of the shell prior to pouring the mixture onto them.
2. I didn't have any bourbon around, and I didn't want to go buy any (especially since it had started snowing outside), so I used Irish Whiskey instead.
3. I decorated the top with chopped up walnuts and chocolate shavings.  Both items toasted beautifully while baking.

Oh my!, this was awesome.  I tweeked the recipe as per others suggestions.  Cutting the bourbon to 2 1/2 tbs and the sugar down to 3/4cup. I cooked mine 325° for 15 minutes then 300° for another hour.  What I found most appealing is, the pie is much better the next day.  The day of cooking didnt have much of the bourbon chocolate pecan balanced taste.  It was still very good but the next day is worth the wait.
This is going to be my go to recipe.

What a surprisingly wonderful creation! I needed a pie for a family gathering where all of the usual suspects would already be supplied. So I tried this with the following medications as other reviewers suggested: 3/4 cup sugar and 2 T bourbon only, plus just a sprinkling of dark chocolate chips across the bottom of the unbaked pie crust. It was amazing! Very rich- but that is ok, just a little piece goes a long way. Thank you for sharing! Making it again now!

I have tried this recipe several times and this pie is always a hit over pumpkin and apple pies at holiday gatherings. I also tried it with different bourbons vs whiskey and learned that the full amount (1/4 c) of a top shelf bourbon is the way to go. Does not have any bite to it that the cheaper stuff gives off. This is a keeper.

Loved it! Very easy! I also did what some other reviewers suggested which was to only use 2 Tablespoons bourbon and only use 3 oz of the semi sweet chocolate chips layered on the bottom before filling.

Super easy and delicious. Our company and I felt the bourbon was the right amount - not too overpowering at all.  We followed the suggestion of others and just sprinkled chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie.  I was surprised by the comments that the recipe made two pies - it perfectly filled one store bought 9" pie crust for me.

OMG this is so good, I lost my grandma's recipe, and found this one and it sounded similar. I also made a few adjustments, I added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon, used honey bourbon, 1.5 cups pecans, and just did dark chocolate chips in the bottom of 2 deep dish crusts. THIS WAS DEFINATELY ENOUGH FOR 2 DEEP DISH PIE CRUSTS. Everyone at work loved them, so making a 2nd batch now for Turkey Day dinner :)

What a mess. I hate when people 4- and 5-star a recipe that they have changed a lot in order to make it work. I should have know better. Yes it tasted OK, but there was enough to two pies. Had to make up another shell. The light corn syrup was too much too and the white sugar…like others posted. I thought the bourbon was just fine though--not overwhelming at all, but it did move across two pies. Either read a lot of the comments or have two shells ready before you make this. Or, use a different recipe.

It's very sweet and rich.  It definitely has the texture of pecan pie but it tastes mostly like chocolate.  I was afraid of the alcohol taste that some people reported so I halved the bourbon.  But, it must have cooked the alcohol off because I didn't taste it.  If you're looking for pecan pie this might not satisfy you, it's more of a chocolate pie.  But served over ice cream it's delicious anyway.
It made two shorter pies for me I might have been able to squeeze most of it into one deep dish pie.

Made this pie yesterday and it was delish!  I am not a baker, and it came out really good, everyone loved it and it's now on the list for Christmas.  Only thing I baked it a little longer, about an hour and 10 minutes, then turned the oven off and let it sit for another 15, oh and I added about a half cup more of pecans.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to like this a lot, but it turned out quite soupy inside. (To be fair, a  lot of pies do that for me, perhaps because I live at a high elevation.) I made it exactly as written. The flavors were very nice, but "slices" of this pie, both fresh and as leftovers, were physically a mess. If this were properly thickened for me, I'd definitely bump up my rating.

I have made this many times and everyone loves it.  I also had the problem of too much filling, even with a deep-dish crust.  What I have started doing, and it comes out perfectly, is using 2 regular (not deep dish) pie crusts.  I keep the ingredients the same except I double the pecans and chocolate chips and split the filling between the two crusts. I line the bottom of the pan with the chips; if you want to mix them in with the filling, don't double them.  The pie is good either way but is more like a custard or chess pie when the chips are mixed in and more of a traditional pecan pie when you don't.  I just prefer not mixing them in.

Great pie, loved it!  I made it as written--thought the bourbon and chocolate were perfect (how can you go wrong with bourbon and chocolate?)--it's a bourbon chocolate pecan pie, so I wanted those flavors to infuse the pie.  I doubled the recipe, found this filled 3 deep dish pie pans nicely.  Maybe could have squeezed all the filling into 2 very full pans, but didn't want to risk having to clean my oven afterwards!

Amazing EXACTLY as written.  I used Evan Williams Tenn Wiskey and had an amazing, not overly potent, flavor.  I brushed the crust with egg white with ten minutes to go and came out beautiful.  Thank you!

I've made this twice and the 2nd time I used 1 C DARK chocolate chips.  EVeryone loved it.  Also, it is critical to follow step 2 exactly.  If the sugar is not completely melted you will get a gritty filling.
Also might try using baker's sugar....finer and will melt faster. And this amount nicely filled a 9" crust.

Easy recipe with great results!  I followed other suggestions: a bit less sugar, used 2 pie shells, spread chocolate chips out over the bottom.  I also added the zest of 1 orange.  Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner enjoyed this pie!

we LOVE this pie! I am not a big fan of nutty desserts, but this one will stay in my recipe drawer forever!! For three years in a row around the holidays my family and classmates ask for this yummy pie, even those who are adamant they do not like pecan pie love this pie! I do make a few small changes, using a portion of the 6 oz of choc chips I line the pie crust with the choc chips before pouring in the filling, which creates a thin layer of chocolate over the crust when the pie sets.  Also, I use Kahlua mudslide instead of bourbon.  The first year I did half bourbon and half kahlua, which was good, but I prefer the full kahlua.  Caution, the recipe will produce more filling than will fit in one 9" deep dish pie crust, so keep an extra crust on hand, trust me, it wont go to waste!

I followed the advice of some reviews by lining the bottom of crust with chips and also cutting back on the bourbon. They turned out terrific! I made 4 pies for a special event and it was gobbled up quickly! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I ended up cooking the pie for 15 minutes longer than the directions recommended and it just wouldn't set up right (Probably my fault somehow), but although it was a little runny it was still very very good!

Somehow I failed with this one, but I followed the recipe exactly.  I think it made too much filling for my pie crusts.  It seems like it boiled out of them in the oven because all of the filling ended up caked on the sides of my pie pan but the crusts themselves were empty.  We still picked at it, but it was very bourbon-y for our taste.  Will try again with some modifications (and maybe more baking experience) and figure out what went wrong

This was my first attempt at making a pecan pie and it turned out AMAZING!  I followed the recipe with the exception of putting the chocolate chips in the bottom of the crust and then pouring the pecan pie filling over it.  I too had a little bit of the filling left, so I just scooped out the pecans and didn't worry about the extra filling.  I cooked the pie until set, which took the full amount of time listed. My family raved about the pie and stated that they will be expecting to have it again for Christmas! Thank you for such a yummy and easy recipe!

This was very easy to make and the results were fantastic.  In fact, I'm making another right now because the first did not last!   For the second pie, I'm going to omit the chocolate completely, and in future versions I think I will reduce it by 1/2 so that the chocolate does not overpower the pecan.  You will need a deep dish pie crust for this amount of filling.  Even the deepest store bought are still a touch too shallow.  I have some ceramic pie dishes designed for big apple pies, and those easily take all the filling.  Still, even with a store bought, not that much is wasted.  Don't worry about the amount, just make this pie!

I have never tried to bake a pecan pie but I saw this recipe last week and decided to give it a go.  Tonight is the night before Thanksgiving 2010.  Pie just cooled so I cut a piece to try......FANTASTIC!!! This pie is so easy, even a nonbaker like me can look like a chef.  Tastes terrific and did I mention how easy it was?!?!?!

Fills a store-bought 9" deep-dish pie shell to *almost* overflowing, so fill/bake on a stiff cookie sheet.  I used 1/3 cup bourbon rather than 1/4 cup, worked out fine.  I also spread the chips in the shell rather than mixing them in.

Really good. Used only 3/4 cup sugar and I would probably cut that to 1/2 cup next time. I also used Bacardi Gold Rum instead. Came out great.

Usually my pecan pies are a big hit. Not with this recipe; it just was not appealing visually or taste wise. Perhaps this would have been better with a chocolate liqueor as opposed to actual chocolate chips which created a chocolate soupy layer.

I used chocolate chips to line the bottom of the pie shell, used less sugar and bourban like most reviewers, and it was a raving success!

For me this recipe didn't work.  The flavors are GREAT, but it separated out into a layer of chocolate, layer of pecans and layer of the corn syrup mixture - which made the consistency a little odd when I was hoping for more of a fudge/nut flavor. I would recommend melting the chocolate first.   The Bourbon however is a MUST.

I thought this pie looked very good, but only one slice was gone by the end of the night.  Hmmm, too intimitdating? I followed reviews and put mini chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie plate.  I put probably 2 layers... BIG mistake.  It was overly sweet, use very little chocolate please.  I used the regular amount of bourbon which ended up being exactly a shooter of Jim Beam.  It did not overpower the taste of the pie to me... until the next day.  After it marinated in the fridge overnight it tasted like straight alcohol.  One thing that I DID do that was awesome was decorate the top of the pie with halved pecans part-way through baking (it was too soft right when I put it in)  this is a MUST to the flavor.  It gives a but of a break from the ultra-rich overpowering part of the pie.  So next time, less chocolate, even more halved pecans.

AMAZING! After looking at some reviews and a first attempt I think I came up with what I think works well - melt about 1/3 of a bag and coat your crust with it. Use about a handful of chocolate chips in the corn syrup/sugar/butter mixture so those melt as well. I also added a lot more pecans than normal since I LOVE pecans...  This pie and another pie recipe I made for my boyfriend's parents for their Thanksgiving this year and both went over AMAZINGLY well! =D

This is a fantastic version of pecan pie. I did cut down a bit on the chocolate chips (used 4 oz.), since I've had the expereince of too much chocolate in a pecan pie. Also, I used the small toll house chips, which disperse better. I didn't chop the pecans. Looks much nicer if you use the halves.

Delicious and easy to make. I was preparing this for my family so I only used 1/8th a cup of Jim Beam Red Stag bourbon, so it would be sweeter and milder. It turned out extremely sweet and chocolatey but very, very tasty!

This was fantastic! I had to make a few x-changes with what I had but it worked. used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, dark corn syrup, 1/4 cp chopped dark chocolate ,Crown Royal 3 Tbsp, 2cups of Pecans. I sprinkled chocolate on pie shell and poured mixture over top. cooked for 60min. and had to let it set on counter for 2hrs before checking it. it finally set fully after well cooled. It was wonderful warm and chilled! Next time I may decrease the butter and sugar a bit and increase the alcohol :)  I would love to try with Bourbon, or Kahlua, but Crown Royal was fantastic. Everyone loved it!

I made 2 of these pies for Thanksgiving, they were AWESOME! I took the advice of a few others and layered the bottom of my pie shell with the chocolate chips, other than that, I followed recipe exact. This on is a keeper, I will be making several as Christmas gifts.

I made this pie to take to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house.  It was a hit!  It was so good, that most of it disappeared that day.  So, I had to make another one for a weekend get-together with some other friends...One of which did not previously like pecan pie.  She says the bourbon made the difference by countering the sweetness.  I will be making this one again and again.  The only thing I changed was to take a tip from previous reviewers to put the chocolate chips on bottom rather than in the mix.

Followed the recipe as written except put chocolate chips in base of shell.  Came out beautifully and tasted terrific.  My guests loved the bourbon and chocolate twist on an old favorite.

I made this for Thanksgiving and this is the BEST pie I've ever made.  Awesome!  I recommend reducing sugar to 3/4 cup and subsituting Kahlua for the bourbon.  My brothers, brother-in-law, and boyfriend absolutely loved this pie, and it beat the pumpkin and apple pie (they said they would have otherwise hated pecan pie if it weren't for this recipe).  Also I followed advice and lined the chocolate chips at the bottom, but I don't think it really matters.  I'll definitely be making this again for Christmas!!!

The taste wasn't so bad, but the texture was horrible. I can't find the right word to describe the bottom layer, like a thin custard, with no real sustenance. It completely seperated from the nuts and chocolate.  As others have said, made way too much filling, but no enough for two pies.

This was good but very sweet.  I made the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site and it was good with it.  I thought I had bourbon, but I didn’t so I used Kahlua instead.  The pie took much longer to bake than the recipe stated, I cooked it an extra half hour longer, at least.  The middle was still a little bit runny, but it was tasty.  Next time try it again I will use bourbon.  Definitely a nice sweet twist to the normal pecan pie.

I took this to my mother-in-law's to impress her with my cooking abilities...and it was a hit! The filling is just perfect! I took out the bourbon and subbed in a little extra vanilla and just the barest hint of almond extract. I recommend making this in the Pie Crust IV recipe on this site. It's a sensation!

I have made this several times and it always turns out perfect. The only changes I made were to sprinkle the chocolate chips on the pie shell before adding filling, and I used Kahlua instead of bourbon. I did not change anything else and it was delicious!

I used Kaluah instead of bourbon.   People went nuts, the pie was gone in no time.  Also, I layered the choclate chips on the bottom of the pie shell, then poured in the filling to bake.  It turned out absolutely perfect!  A new family tradition.

Delicious.  Use all the bourbon, but make this pie only if you like bourbon.  I think it's a lot better chilled than warm, but some of my family enjoys it best warm.  I make it with a whole wheat pie crust, and it tastes fine.  I also sprinkle the chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie crust rather than mixing them in--this pie is sooooo good:  very rich and decadent.

I have a great recipe for chocolate pecan pie but wanted to try something new. This one had an added step and extra pot because of the cooked mixture. I found that step a waste. It melted all  the chocolate chips and caused the top of the crust to be overly dry. If you do make this, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup of less, but I wouldn't cut the bourbon. I did, and I scarcely tasted it. Despite my complaints, this pie  was quite tasty, hence the four stars.

This was a really yummy, rich dessert!  Like other reviewers, I used Kahlua instead of bourbon (didn't have any) and it added a nice subtle flavor, not overpowering whatsoever.  I put the chocolate and nuts into the crust and poured the filling over the top.  This resulted in a somewhat traditional pecan pie flavor with a nice quantity of delicioius chocolate chunks.  Served well chilled with a tall glass of cold milk--it just hit the spot!  However, I ended up baking the pie for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Next time, will increase temp at little to cut down on baking time.

Mine did not set properly.  I have cooked pecan pie in the past and they were great.  Also the bourbon taste is very strong so would cut back on that.

Just put my second pie in the oven. I made the first one for Thanksgiving. It got rave reviews from all that ate it. I loved it as is. But decided this time to make it with a little less chocolate. Bet that is good too! This will remain my pecan pie recipe from now on!!

This is the best pie ever! I used kahlua instead of bourbon as suggested in another review, great idea! Also used  a few less chocolate chips. Make sure you use a deep dish pie crust because I did have a bit of a mess. I served at our family holiday get together and everyone just raved about how good it was. I will never make just one of these pies again because the next day I would have loved to have another slice! I am also going to try adding Irish cream liquour instead of kahlua next time. Yummy!!!!

Too much chocolate. I also thought the middle was too custardy.

Wonderful and Rich!  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Definitely put the chocolate chips in a layer on the pie crust and then pour the rest of the ingrediants over them.

My family loved this recipe for Thanksgiving. I varied the recipe by melting the chocolate chips with the sugar and corn syrup before mixing it with the eggs and bourbon and pouring it over the pecans (it will come out darker when it bakes). It is even better the day after Thanksgiving!!!! Thanks for a great "keeper" recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. The only change I made was to add kahlua instead of burbon.  I wish I would have bought deep dish pie crust because the filling was too much for just one regular pie crust so I ended up with two.  I thought the pie was interesting, not quite what I would call a pecan pie, but it was good anyway.

Really good recipe.  To make sure the chocolate flavor was even throughout, I melted the chips along with the sugar and butter.  Got great reviews at Thanksgiving.

This pie was delicious, I made it to take for Thanksgiving dinner. I took others advice and cut down on the sugar, bourbon and chocolate chips. This made it just right not too sweet or over powering bourbon flavor. I will make this again for sure. Everyone loved it.

This pie is delicious. I served it for Thanksgiving and will make it again and again! I did make a few changes after reading some of the other reviews. I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and mixed them with the pecans. Put pecans and chip mix into pie shell and then oured sauce over. I also recuced bourban to 2 T. Yummy!!!!

I am a HUGE fan of Pecan Pie, and this is my favorite. I cut the recipe in half, put it in a 6 inch pie crust and use less chocolate so the bourbon stands out. I also think it tastes best with Knob Creek versus Jack Daniels as the Jack is overpowering. Its a huge hit everytime I make it and I'm always asked for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at peacan pie and I am very pleased with the outcome.  I made it mainly for my husband who loves peacan pie and I got rave reviews from him.  I did follow some suggestions and added the chocolate to the bottom of the pie and added the egg and peacans mixture on top.  I figured that would make the bottom layer of the pie chocolate and the peacon layer on top.  But during baking the chocolate mingled with the peacans on the top of the pie and my husband thought that took away some of the taste of the peacans.  But he did manage to eat 3 slices of the pie, not all in one sitting and said this will be a family favorite.  I might leave the cholate off next time or just use less as some suggested as well, but overall I am very happy with the outcome.  And so easy even a pathetic baker like myself manged that one.

Great! It is always a hit. I sometimes leave out the nuts. You must be careful to not let the sugar mixture cool down too much or your chocolate chips will not melt and you must keep stirring vigorously! It is a great pie and always gets good reviews and comments especially with a little extra bourbon!

I made this with a sour-cream crust, reducing the bourbon to 3 tablespoons.  It  won a pie-baking "contest" at work.  Can't get much better than that!

This recipe was easy to follow. I used a 9” glass pie dish and I attempted my own crust which came out too thick so it led to me having extra leftover over pie filling. I had some phyllo dough in the freezer so I experimented and put the phyllo dough in my small cupcake pan and poured the extra pie mix in there and baked it for about 15 minutes at the same temperature as this recipe. It turned out perfect!

This is the best. I dont use as much chocolate chips and I really let it cool before added them so they dont melt. I find using the full amount and letting them melt makes it too chocolatey so it use maybe 1/2 cup. I have this for my bday every year!

This is a very rich and scrumptious dessert! The only thing I changed was I only put 4 pecans in the centre rather than fill the entire top of the pie. I highly recommend  this recipe!!!!

I made this for my future son-in-law when I found out that Pecan Pie is his favorite.  I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie rather than mixing them in and I added about 1/2 cup extra pecans.  It was delicious and really very easy to make.  He LOVED it. Definitely will be making this again and again.

Big hit at Christmas dinner. Was great as-is, but I’m also a huge bourbon fan. I think I’ll likely try it with 2T bourbon and maybe less chocolate next time but I have no qualms with how it came out as written.

I didn't  make  any  changes but I  will the next  time  I will. It was to rich  & chocolatey plus the bourbon was little  overwhelming but if you  like a rich pie then this will be  right  down  your  alley.

It was okay.  It was eggier than the pecan pies I like.  Not gooey sweet, it was more like flan with chocolate and pecans.  Still good, but not what i was expecting.

This is my husband’s all time favorite pie. The only thing I do differently is layer the chips and pecans in the pie crust (to ensure equal distribution of deliciousness) and pour the filling on top.

changes: 3/4 c brown sugar instead of 1 c white, a heaping 1/2 c of chocolate chips instead of 6 oz --add most to a bottom layer of the pie, mix the rest w/ the pecans--  1 1/3 c pecans instead of 1 c, add a smidge of cinnamon

Made this with 3/4 cup sugar as advised by commenters, BUT definitely use the entire amount of bourbon. Use good bourbon too.

This pie has become a holiday favorite and highly requested with the family. It’s now ‘my’ special dish. I love it! I half the amount of bourbon and Ghirardelli 60% chocolate chips. Rich and delish!

This is the first pecan pie I’ve ever made and it’s delicious!  I did only 1/4? cup mini chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons of bourbon.  Definitely a keeper!

I have never made a pecan pie before and this one "takes the cake"!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I did only use 1/4 cup or less of chocolate chips after reading reviews, and 3 tablespoons of bourbon to not overpower.

Much better if you cook the sugar-corn syrup-butter mix to a full rolling boil. Then let the filling cool to about 120° before slowly adding it to the egg mix. This greatly reduces the chance of ending up with a liquid or soupy filling.
Go deep dish crust, or you'll end up with too much filling for shell.
Blind bake the deep-dish crust for best results.
Substitute another alcohol for the bourbon. I've made it with rum, whiskey, spiced rum, and Grand Marnier with excellent results.
Add 1/4t of orange oil (thank you, King Arthur Flour!) for a really fun flavor – chocolate, pecans, and orange are made for each other.

*I made this pie excluding the bourbon as some reviewers had said they left out. After picking out the recipe it was pointed out to me that the alcohol may pose a problem for some guests* My Thanksgiving guests were excited to try this pie but it fell short of their expectations. It was the very last of my pies to disappear after Thanksgiving.My pecan pie loving husband couldn't put his finger on what was wrong with the pie. I made the recipe as written and followed other reviews advice about placing chocolate chips in the crust. I did need to bake the pie longer than stated on the recipe to get it to set up.

The only thing I did differently was I used a full 1 1/2 cups of pecans and I divided the chocolate chips between the two frozen pie crusts (this makes two if you're using storebought) and I put them on the bottom instead of mixing them in.  I also put some of the pecans in on the bottom and put the pecan/sugar/butter mixture on top of all of the chips & pecans.  Baked on the middle rack and no need to shield the pie crust.  Came out beautifully!  EVERYONE loved them!!! People were going back for THIRDS!!

Love this pie.  As others note, cut the bourbon way back.  If your not into the bourbon, the recipe works great without it with no changes needed to account for the liquid change.  2 tablespoons of bourbon seems to be a great compromise, as others have said.

I make this every year with one slight modification.  Instead of putting bourbon in the egg mixture.  I soak the pecans in the bourbon the night before.   Never a bourbon taste to the pie, but it enhances the nuts!  Very rich and decadent!

I made this  pie with the adjustments that others recommended, such as 3/4 cup sugar and I just sprinkled about 2 ounces of chocolate chips on the bottom.  I also made the crust from scratch in a deep bottomed pie plate.  It looks lovely!

This might be the single best pie I have ever made. I went with a 10" crust and went 1.5 on the recipe without doing extra bourbon. I'm sure you could and it would be fine. Highly recommended and I'm stealing this recipe when I open my BBQ place some day.

I made this for our Kentucky Derby party and it was a hit.  I do not like bourbon so I used amaretto instead.  I served it with ice cream for anyone who wanted a scoop.  I read other reviews and used a deep dish pie shell and there was still a little filling leftover.  So next time a am going to get 2 regular pie shells and make to regular size pies.

I followed meowsie's suggestions and used 3/4 c sugar, less bourbon and less chocolate.  I mixed the pecans and chocolate chips together and put them in the crust and then added the filling to it. Definitely use a deep dish and let the syrup mixture cool so that it doesn't melt the chips when you pour it in. Deep dish crust! Took it to ken and fritzi's housewarming and it was a big hit!

I used bittersweet chocolate spread in the bottom of the crust. Used the dark corn syrup and 1/ 4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  I will be making this again.

Ive made this a few times now. People love it. I listened to all the reviews and followed their advice. This usually produces good results, but I find that the recipe as is, was just perfect. Except I just place the chips on the bottom instead of pre-melting.

Very delicious pie, but at nearly 650 calories per slice, it's very hard to find an occasion sufficiently grand enough to justify making this pie.  I realize that's just a problem with pecan pies in general, but how good can a recipe really be if you can almost never make it?

This recipe is amazing and I make it every Christmas to rave reviews - I usually add another 1/2 cup of pecans. This year however, I substituted healthier date syrup for the corn syrup. The taste was very dominant so I added another 1/2 cup alcohol (I use whiskey), 1/4 cup of cream, and one more egg. Was even better than the original and no more corn syrup :)

Made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out beautifully. I gave it four stars because it’s really rich! I think next, there will be a ‘next time’ for sure, I’ll cut back on white sugar. The bourbon can be tasted and it really melds well with the pecans. I might try a nut crust the next time.

This is the family's favorite pie every year for over 10 years now. I've always made it just as written, but this year I cut back the bourbon just a smidge and used dark chocolate and they said it was even better!

I found that this pie was FANTASTIC!!!
You have to like bourbon to appreciate this pie and since I'm a born & raised Louisville, Kentucky bourbon lover, I didn't find it to be too much!!   I used Woodford Reserve Bourbon since that's one of my favorites.  There was just a hint of bourbon flavor the day I made it, but after that it was more intense and delicious!!!  
Will definitely make again for my next Derby Party!!

I used Kahlua instead of bourbon as someone else suggested. I also used dark corn syrup and dark brown sugar. We all enjoyed it very much especially my husband. It is very rich and we just ate small servings.

Very nice pie.  However, it was too rich for my husband and my 17 year old didn’t like the bourbon taste. So darn, guess I’ll have to eat the whole thing myself!

This pie was very good.  I used a deep dish pie shell and it all fit in one shell.  I didn't chop the pecans but arranged them prettily on the top.  While this made a nice presentation, it didn't cut well. Next time, I'll chop the nuts.  Overall - yum.

To die for!  I made exactly as recipe stated for our Thanksgiving dinner and would not change a thing.  We loved the additional 'kick' of both the chocolate and the bourbon. Eat in moderation - very rich, sweet and delicious!

Great recipe! I used a flaky crust recipe that makes 2 8" bottom crusts (2 c flour, 3/4c crisco and ICE cold water by the tablespoon flake w fork until combined) so I used 1.5 x the filling recipe and extra chocolate chips.  Also did not pre cook crust before filling and baking.

No doubt about it, If you like bourbon, chocolate and pecans, you will like this pie.  Except for the crust sticking to the Pyrex pie plate (I believe this happened from poking to many holes in the dough), and the filling being runny, the taste was great.  I believe I will make a few adjustments to the quantity of bourbon and poke only a few holes in the crust next time around.

It was a hit!  Didn't feel the 1/4 C. of Bourbon was overwhelming...seemed just right.  Maybe a little less sugar...will probably use brown sugar next time.

As another reviewer suggested, I cut the sugar back to 3/4 c as well as the corn syrup, and reduced the bourbon to 2 T--that made the total volume perfect for my pie plate.

I read a few other reviews and took some advice to make adjustments. Unfortunately, this filling actually makes 2 pies, because I realized I had over filled it and it made a mess on the cookie sheet from overflowing while baking. I noticed when I took it out that a part of the pie looked unset because of the corn syrup mixture kind of protruding out. So I left it in for another 10 mns hoping that would help.

Delicious. Made it with chocolate chunks that I put on bottom of crust. Pecans float to the top. I used chopped. Tossed a bit of the filling out as I used a frozen m.calendars (sp) crust because I was pressed for time; next time I would use a larger glass pie plate. Pie was the hit of the party!!! Totally full people had seconds. Decadent!

It was a great variation on the usual pecan pie (which I love, but I wanted to be different on my late Thanksgiving dinner - and it WAS!)
Well, technically, Dickel isn't KY bourbon, but it's what I like, and what I had on hand.  I bought Ghirandelli dark chocolate pieces.  I don't think I've ever had a more decadent dessert!  I guess I stuck to it completely.  I will not tweak it for future runs.  It's perfect as is!!!  Very rich.

It sounded great but wasn't as wonderful as I had hoped. Baked it longer than suggested and in the end it was still a little bit runny. The taste was good. Also put pecan halves all around so it looked amazing.

Oh my . . . . . if I could give this 10 stars, I would.  There wasn't too much chocolate, or too much bourbon- it was spectacular!  I did put the chocolate chips on the crust before pouring in the mixture and that worked fine.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  When I suggested that we had a new Thanksgiving tradition, my husband said, "We're not waiting for Thanksgiving to have this again!"

I  just made this for Thanksgiving and it was truly decadent.  I took suggestions made by others such as placing the morsels directly on the dough and reducing the bourbon to 2 tablespoons.  You could taste the bourbon and it wasn't overwhelming.  Warm it with a little whipped cream on the side.....you can't go wrong. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving . I used a store bought frozen 9 inch deep dish pie shell & it was just big enough. I lined the bottom of the shell with Ghirardelli chocolate and used the rest of the directed 6oz in the mix. I used 1/4 cup Woodford Reserve. I also used Pecan halves on top as shown in the photo. The result was mediocre.  The pie did not slice, but was rather gooey. Of the 6 of us, 5 thought the bourbon was overpowering.  Adding the extra pecans on top was too much. It was also too sweet I'm not sure how I would fix this, so I won't be making this again.

I've been making this recipe for the last several years. My family has started requesting it starting in October, and it remains a favorite at gatherings through the winter. My personal twist: instead of vanilla, I use Triple Sec. Gives it a nice citrus finish. 

Hint of advice for first timers: when you mix in the eggs, you don't have to wait for the sugar to cool, just be sure to mix  very well while you add the sugar... it's tempering the eggs. You want the combined mixture to still be very hot while you add the chocolate chips so that they melt easily. 

Also, it doesn't hurt to blind bake the crust in advance, and even to pre-bake the pecans to give them a little more flavor.

Cheers!

I made as directed except put in less bourbon because so many reviewers said it overwhelmed the dish. I shouldn't have listened because I couldn't even tell it was there. If I make it again, the only things I would change from the original recipe would be to put in fewer chocolate chips, more pecans, and maybe cook it 5 min longer.

For a Kentucky Derby party tomorrow, I wanted to make a finger-food version of the traditional “Run for the Roses” Pie. I couldn’t find a recipe, so decided to combine this one with the Tiny Tarts recipe from this site. I doubled the Tiny Tarts dough and followed those instructions for making the crusts; I used this recipe (single batch) for the filling . Once I had the dough in the mini muffin tins, per other posters’ suggestions I put 4-6 chocolate chips in the bottom of each cup rather than mixing them into the filling; I also added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans, used good Kentucky bourbon (Four Roses), and the best quality chocolate I could find. Baking time for my tarts at 325 was 20-25 minutes, and they came out perfectly!  The doubled dough recipe made 48 tarts, but there's enough filling leftover that you could probably triple it and have another 24 tarts. So yummy - I found this recipe to have a perfect blend of flavors and textures. I’ve never even made a pie crust before so I’m thrilled at how they came out, and imagine these will become a Derby party tradition for us. Thanks!

This pie is great but instead of 325, preheat oven to 400 degrees then put pie in and reduce temperature to 350. At 325, I had to cook it for an hour 40 minutes. It is just too low temperature.

Amazing. Thanks for the tips, commenters. I followed the common adaptations--less bourbon, fewer chocolate chips, less sugar, deep dish pie plate. This was my best pie ever, and is my new favorite.

Very good.  I used a combination of other people's recommendations:   Substituting 3/4 cup dark brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, added chocolate chips to pie crust instead of mixing into pie,  also used 4 ounces chocolate chips, and only used 2 tbsp of good bourbon.   This recipe made enough for 2 pies.

So this is my first attempt at pie making. So there's a chance I did something wrong. I followed the directions to a t and I ended up making 2 pies. So if they are good I will halve the ingredients next time. They smell delicious so I have high hopes!

I love pecan pie. After making this pie myself, I had to wonder why I ever bought one. It's easy, fun, and better than any store bought. Now my adult children come to me for the recipe.

I took advice from the other reviewers, cut the bourbon to 2 tablespoons and cut the chocolate chips to only a layer on the crust at the bottom.  I used a 10 inch pie plate, and increased the pecans by 1/2-3/4 cup.  The amount of filling was perfect for a 10 inch pie, and the results were fabulous!  Beware!  This is a VERY rich pie, so cut it in small pieces.  Make it a day or two in advance to let the flavors meld, and you will be thrilled.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving.

I made this for Thanksgiving as per the recipe, and it was delicious! I did find issues with mixing in the chocolate chips well, as they seemed to clump together. I made this again today, however as some others have recommended, put half the chocolate chips on the bottom of the crust, as well as topped with pecan halves. It's in the oven and smells fantastic! I think this may be my new "go to" dessert, as it's so simple to make!

I made this recipe and placed pie in oven as directed and after 55 min,after cooling it was runny,the chips weren't all melted,I wonder if the baking sheet absorbed some heat?
Also I thought it was way too sweet.

Opted for more bourbon, less chocolate, and more pecans. Had about half a pie of filling left over, plan on making a filled bread with the leftover filling. Melted the chocolate beforehand, made a shell with it around the crust. Worst review from family was "I didn't know I needed an ID for this pie"

I think this could be better. I will try it again and make a few changes. I used the suggestion of 1/2 C of chocolate chips. That was still too much chocolate. I cut the bourbon in half, that was way too much, I'm wishing I had used the 2T of bourbon suggestion. I used the suggestion of cutting  the sugar to 3/4 C, good idea. I'll try this again, but cutting back on the chocolate chips and using 2T bourbon.

Smells amazing.  I think the 325 degrees isn't hot enough.  after 55 mins the filling looked set, but the crust looked raw. since I was making an apple pie next I turned it up to 425 and left it in for a few more minutes.  We'll see tomorrow if that was too much. I made this once before,  and everyone loved it.

I loved it. My husband suggested to add a little less bourbon because he felt it was overwhelming. I did not chop up the pecans, I used them whole.

The bourbon was too strong for the kids. Adults liked it. I wouldn't consider this a Thanksgiving pie since not everyone will enjoy it.

i loved this pie. BUT it does make 2 regular size pies.  I took out 1c. of the sugar-corn syrup mixture before i added the egg mixture.  I also left out the bourbon and substituted dark corn syrup instead of light corn syrup.  baked it 57 minutes and it was PERFECT!

We enjoyed this pie although I did follow some of the suggestions, only lined the baked pie crust with chocolate chips, used 2 Tbsp of bourbon and 1/2 c. of brown sugar and 1/4 c. of white sugar. I also used 2 c. of pecans. It was delicious and I did use a deep dish frozen pie crust. I think because I doubled the pecans I had some filling left over.  I used this for a smaller pie crust,  with which I did not use the chocolate chips. Taste was wonderful, closer to the pie I had at the derby than other recipes we've tried. Thanks for posting!

I used Jim Beam Maple Bourbon for this recipe and it came out extremely well. I have some food allergies, so I used a gluten free pastry crust (bad idea - next  time I'll use a GF graham cracker crust instead), organic brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup, and Enjoy Life chocolate chips. 
Note: This recipe makes enough filling for two 9" pies of standard depth. The white sugar could easily be cut in half or omitted entirely - this is a SUPER rich, sweet dessert.

I used about 3/4 cup of sugar and I used Kahlua instead of bourbon.  I also did as the other reviewers said and put the chips on the bottom of the crust.  The pecans, of course, went to the top and the chocolate chips made a layer underneath the pecans!  Outstanding!  I made it for one of the teacher's birthdays and it was gone almost before we finished singing Happy Birthday!

Good flavor but didn't bake up as much as I had hoped it would.  I used a standard pie plate with homemade crust but it came out flat and barely made it 1/3 the way up the sides.  I replaced half the corn syrup with equal parts honey and pure maple syrup.  I also decreased the bourbon to 1 1/2 tablespoons and omitted the chocolate.

I've been making a modified version of this for years. Had to tweak it to get it just right for me. If I add the chocolate it's 1/4 cup (and I subtract 1/4 cup sugar). Use dark syrup and swap out a dash of molasses. 

My pan is deep dish and it is filled up so I'm sure a regular pan would be a tight fit.

A big hit!  Used Jack Daniels and it was great.  Our company loved it as did my husband.  He wondered why I deviated from my usual non chocolate recipe but then was happy I did!  Just a note, I only made 75% of the recipe ingredients, it would have been way too much volume for a regular pie size.

I wish I had never made this pie.  I can't resist eating it and my family will not let me make something different instead of this recipe for the special holidays. I like changing things up from time to time.  If you have dark chocolate lovers, beware!

I made this for Thanksgiving. The chocolate and bourbon was much, and the pie filling itself was custardy, and I didn't care for it. Not the usual type of pecan pie.

I altered it to use (1) a deep-dish 9" pie shell, (2) 2.5 ounces of Jack Daniels, (3) 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate melted and spread on the bottom of the pie shell (which I put back in the freezer) to create a bottom layer separate from the very delicious vanilla-bourbon-corn syrup-sugar-eggs filling, and (4) more pecans.  Our guests loved it.  My suggestion is that the pie not be served warm because the filling won't fully congeal until it has been in the refrigerator for a while.  I have some extra filling.  Where did I put those mini-pie shells?

Doubled recipe for two pies. Made perfect amount. Used Kahlua instead of bourbon. Spread 3 oz of semi sweet chips on the bottoms of the crusts, filled and baked. Everyone raved!

Loved this! It did make a lot of filling, even for my deep dish crust, so I might cut down a bit on the sugar, corn syrup, & butter. I altered the recipe slightly by using 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar & adding 1 tsp maple extract along with the bourbon. I loved the rich, smoky flavor from the bourbon w/ the maple & the decadent taste of the chocolate & pecans! This is my favorite pecan pie recipe!

WOW - this is phenomenal.  I LOVE this pie.  The bourbon flavor is a little strong, so I reduce it to a couple table spoons or so (I'm a bad measurer).  But let me recommend - when you are choosing a bourbon to use in the pie - the brand matters.  Try it with Southern Comfort.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It is naturally a little sweeter than other bourbons, and it works SO well in this pie.  I've used Makers Mark and JD, but Southern Comfort wins!!  It's so good.  It's good in egg nog, too - which goes perfectly with the pie. yum!

As others have noted, the chocolate overwhelms the other flavors, and it's difficult to get the consistency right if you make the pie as written.  It came out a bit like chocolate soup for me.  Make sure you read the advice on modifying before you try this one!

I have about 4 recipes for "Derby" pie.  This is by far the best.  If you like the pie, try it with Bourbon Whipped Cream (recipe on this site).  Dangerous stuff.  One note, if you use a pre-made frozen pie shell, you'll have too much filling.  It makes enough to fill a Pyrex deep dish glass pie plate.

I made this for Thanksgiving as one of my desserts.  It was very, very rich and very good.  The only thing that I would do different next time is to half the amount of chocolate chips and possibly melt them first and add to the pie crust before the filling.  The chocolate chips didn't seem to melt at all.  This was very good with a little bit of whipped cream on top.

I made two pies, one for the in-laws and the other for my family. There were two different reactions the in-laws loved it, they love chocolate and have a huge sweet tooth, but my family thought it was too sweet now they don't like as many sweets. I actually thought it was kind of sweet and will cut back on the chips next time unless it is for the in-laws. Other than that everyone loved it and its really easy to make.

Great! My whole family loved this when I brought it for Thanksgiving. Next time I will add a little more bourbon because it was not as present as I expected. Also, I used mini chocolate chips so they would melt faster.

This turned out so well! My family loved it. I used closer to 1/2 cup bourbon, and also used a chocolate graham cracker crust. I've made a lot of different versions of pecan pies, and this is quickly becoming my favorite.

You need to say this makes 2 9-inch pies not one! Just made the pie filling and luckily had a frozen pie crust for extra filling. That's ok I'll give the extra to some neighbors!!!

I doubled this recipe and had enough "liquid" mixture for 3 deep dish pie crusts. I, like others, put the chocolate chips and pecans right in the crusts, then pour the liquid over the top - this ensures nuts and chocolate in every piece. I got lazy this time and left the pecan halves whole; the pie was prettier, but a little harder to cut. This pie has come to be known in our family as "crack pie," because it is so good you crave it, and I wouldn't dare have a family holiday without it or my in-laws would chase me with pitchforks.

This is a terrific pie! I have made for several years now using different liquor for a twist. Last year it was kahlua, this year rum. FANTASTIC anyway you make it and requested by all our family and friends. Chocolate chips turn out better when you place them on the bottom of pie crust as others have commented.

I have fixed this several times.  I reduce sugar to 3/4 cup and followed the advice of other reviewers and layer the chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie shell. It works fine without the bourbon.  I bake for 60 minutes.  It it easy and delicious!

I had HUGE high hopes for this one....and was really dying for it....but unfortuantely my pie did not cook up properly....and I have no idea why. It was gorgeous though.....but very loose in the middle even though it had cooked for way longer than stated. It kinda turned out like a molten chocolate pecan pie. Tasted great and had to eat witha spoon....I even decrease the amount of bourbon....but I did add a little more of the chocolate chips and maybe thats what threw this recipe off.....my only bummer recipe this Thanksgiving....BUT I am gonna try again.....

This recipie makes enough for 2 pies so be ready for that. I made this pie last thanksgiving and sent one with my mother in-law to her mothers and i took the other to my cousins house!  I got nothing but rave reviews from everyone there. My cousin loved it so much that she insited that i give her the recipie before i left!  when i got home my mother in-law sang nothing but praise about the pie as well. the only compliante that i got was that there was not enough for seconds! this is deffiatly staying in my recipie box to be pulled out time and time again.

The recipe is great, however in Kentucky a lot of us make this pie without the bourbon. The bourbon does have a tendency to over power the other flavors.

Everyone loves this pie! I make it for my annual Cinco de Mayo/Kentucky Derby party. Based on other reviews, I lowered the white sugar to 3/4 cup and the bourbon to 2 TBS.

What an awesome pie this is! A deep dish pie crust is helpful because there's so much filling.

A good pie, though very rich. The bourbon was a bit strong for some people, but overall a nice treat.

I have made this same recipe for years.  Since I first made it, it has been required for me to bring this to Thanksgiving every year. I sometimes omit the bourbon and chop only about half the pecans.  Delicious!

Great pie! The amount of bourbon is perfect. I did add the choc chips to the bottom it worked out very well. I used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar for a richer flavor - I also only used a total of 3/4 cup. Very easy, very tasty and a new family fav!

SO rich and yummy! Not sure why, but I layered the choc chips on the bottom as others suggested (gave in to peer pressure from the reviews! : ) The bourbon smell did seem strong, and I can taste it, but its not overpowering to me (if I planned to serve it when kids were present, I may scale back.) Great, easy pie!

This was an interesting twist on a traditional favorite.  When I make it again I think I'll use about 1/2 the chocolate though.

Fantastic!!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used slightly less sugar, and only lined the bottom of the pie with chocolate chips, but I used the full amount of bourbon, and it wasn't overpowering at all.  Maybe the other reviewers were wimpier than my family!  I don't bake much, but I will definitely make this one over and over!

Excellent recipe! Warm it in the oven before serving and the chips will be gently melted into a pecan bourbon perfection.

This was a hit at the Kentucky Derby party I attended yesterday. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone said it was WONDERFUL although a little sweet. I will definitely make this again. (Makes 2 pies if you don't use deep dish crust.)

I first made this pie for my six male roommates as a tester for thanksgiving 2008. They DEVOURED it quickly (I dont think it made it past that night), and asked for more. At Thanksgiving, we had a large group over for dinner, and everyone fought to have a piece of this. It is now the pie that both my family and roommates ask for when they know I'm baking.  I made a few changes based on suggestions: used Kahlua instead of bourbon, and layered the chocolate on the bottom of the pie instead of mixing it in.

This pie was a hit Thanksgiving. So good. Everyone had it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I didn't have  bourbon (AND IT WAS SUPER)but plan to make it again with. As other reviewers mentioned, use a really deep dish pie pan or two shallow ones.

I'd never made a pecan pie before, but I definitely will be making this one again.   I followed others suggestions and cut the sugar in half.  I didn't have any bourbon so I added half a cup of kahlua and thought it was the perfect combination of sweet and crunchy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a favorite dish during the holidays. I agree with the other reviews, a bit sweet so I cut down the chocolate to half of what the recipe suggest. I also found a great little trick, instead of doing anything with the chocolate just buy mini morsels chocolate by toll house this solves the chocolate problem!

Very good, very rich pie. I blind baked the crust so it was perfectly flaky. I took another reviewers advice and lined the crust with chocolate chips (Ghirardelli - yum!). I didn't have the problem of too much filling as others did. I used a 9 inch glass pie dish and Pillsbury crust. I might try using Kahlua instead of bourbon next time. Yum!

I made this pie for a family get together on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I thought the top got a little overdone, I would suggest keeping a close eye on it during the last fifteen minutes of cooking to ensure that it doesn't get too brown. I left the bourbon as-is and decreased the chips to 4 oz, I think next time I would decrease the bourbon just a touch. It was a little overwhelming to the rest of the pie (and I never met bourbon I didn't like!). This is a wonderful recipe, I will certainly make again.

This is seriously the best pie I have ever made. I took others' advice and put the chocolate chips in the crust first and then poured the filling over it. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for before it was set, but it turned out beautifully. This will be a definite staple on Thanksgiving from now on!

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert, and it was awesome.  It took way longer to bake though.  I used Hershey Special Dark morsels and melted them, adding them to the pecan syrup mixture.  It was delish!

I used only about a TBSP or so of bourbon.  I didn't want the flavor to be too strong.

I read the reviews and also did some recipe tweaking - cut down on chocolate chips (used 3 oz) and bourbon (1/4 cup), next time will use more bourbon and even less chocolate chips but the pie turned out pretty darn tasty - I finished the whole thing almost by myself. The deep dish pie crust tip was a good one - it barely fit! Will definitely make again.

I have tried lots of desserts but this was the best one in a long time. I ended up with quite a bit of filling so i mae a second pie for work and they just finished it. Several people asked for the recipe. I would not reduce anything. The pie was great. This was quick and easy to prepare. Yummy!

This was not what I was looking for.  I had a bourbon pecan pie that was outstanding and I have tried several recipes to find that taste, but haven't been able to find it.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everyone loved it.  I dropped the bourbon to 2 T. since I am not a great fan of that taste in pies.

Very good.  I thought the bourbon was a bit too strong and will cut the amount in 1/2.  Otherwise, excellent recipe!

Loved this pie! I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was highly complimented. Reminded me of the Derby Pies I've had in KY.

I made one for my co-workers and one of them said it was the best thing they had ever tasted. Another hated pecan pie but loved this one so much she got the recipe and will be making one herself.

I made some adjustments based on other reviews and used: 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 TBSP of bourbon, then just a layer of chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust.  I did not measure the chips.  The chips didn’t melt which I guess was good for some.  However, they did intermix with the filling.  I think if I made again, I might use melted baking chocolate to line the bottom of the pie crust instead of using chocolate chips.  I didn’t care for the filling all that much either.  This pie doesn’t taste bad, but it isn’t one of the best pecan pies I’ve ever eaten.

We made this for Thanksgiving. I really didn't get any feedback from the family either positive or negative, so I hesitate to give it 5 stars.  But my spouse and I absolutely loved it.   We will make it again for sure, and for a more adventurous, less traditional crowd next time. I'll bet we get raves.

This pie was fantastic.  I did make the adjustment of 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 TBSP of bourbon, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and put it in a deep dish pie crust.  My family loved it!

My husband loved this pie! I did not care for it warm, however after I refrigerated the pie I thought it was terrific. I put the chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust and then added the pie mixture. My chips did not melt completely and the pie was pretty.

Great Pecan Pie.  Made this for my family and co-workers.  They loved it.  The chocolate and burbon definitely make this pie the best Pecan Pie I have ever had.  I will definitely be taking this to Thanksgiving.

This was easy and a real treat. It's sticky enough that you don't need much crust. Might be worth trying with a different kind of nut, such as hazelnuts, and cutting back a bit on the sugar to emphasize the chocolate and salt a bit more.

This pie was SOOOOO good. I made it again because I had all the stuff, and tried to share as much as I could with friends, so that I wouldn't eat the whole thing in 2 days. My friend has asked for the recipe. It's really yummy warmed up with vanilla ice cream. Anyway, I will definitely make this again.

This was sooo good and easy!  My family was a little skeptical when I first told them I was making a dessert for the holidays -- I'm the non-cook in the family.  This dish was so good that it made a believer out of them! Great recipe!

This recipe has received rave reviews from my family each time I make it.   It is better than the version served at our local dessert spot.
