I'm sorry but this recipe just didn't do it for me.  I made it based on previous reviews, but I'm afraid I won't be making this again.  Sorry, Jennifer   :(

Reading the previous reviews helped me make this recipe work!  The sugar definately needs to be cut in half and adding more veggies and red onion worked great.  Another dish to add to my collection where people are always asking for the recipe!

I would add much less sugar next time...way too sweet.  I also added chopped red onion, diced tomatoes and a small can of sliced black olives.  This made it much more colorful and better tasting.  A fun one to play with.

The basic ingredients are fine, but the proportions need adjustment.  I used mini bow-tie pasta, and would cut the pasta back to 1/2 to 3/4 pound.  I used a whole cucumber, seeded and chopped; 2 cups of chopped broccoli; a whole red pepper, seeded and chopped.  I combined the rest of the ingredients to make a dressing, then added it to the pasta and vegetables.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 3 tablespoons of Miracle Whip. After adjustments, I really did enjoy the flavor, with the mustard being a nice change of pace from the usual creamy pasta salad.   The recipe as written makes a huge amount, so I probably won't make a full recipe again unless it's for a church supper.

My family and I normally LOVE pasta salads, but this one was way too sugary.

We had this at our end of the summer picnic and everyone loved it.  We couldn't stop picking at the veggies.  I used tomotoes, cucumbers, olives, red onion, yellow bell peppers and broccoli.  It was a nice colorful dish for a buffet.

I reviewed this previously but forgot the stars!  This is a great recipe!  I too cut the sugar some and doubled the veggies.   We love the crunch of onions, bell peppers, cucumbers, even squash.  I just check out what the store has when I go.  We fix this for all types of gatherings all year long and it is very well received.  Just thought after all the lower reviews, I needed to stand up for one of my favorite stand-bys!

I would not use this recipe again.  WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!  I used only 1/3 (sugar) of what the recipe called for and it was still too much!  Luckily, my husband suggested adding some lime juice, which took away a lot of the sweet taste.  YIKES!

My husband and I really enjoyed this salad.  I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them and I halved the sugar as some of the other reviewers suggested.  It was still a little sweet so I may cut it back some more next time.  I look forward to making this at the next family get together.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious pasta recipe.  Different from most pasta recipes.  It was a hit at the family reunion and had lots of recipe requests.  I did however, use a little less sugar and more shredded cheese.

Read previous reviews, and cut back on sugar.  My husband doesn't like yellow mustard so I used half yellow and half dijon.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing

3.5 - We liked this although it was quite sweet. I used ingredients that I had on hand so substituted farfalle (bowties) instead of seashell pasta. For the vegetables I used cucumber, red pepper, and cauliflower. I found there was more than enough dressing. If I made this again, I would add some white onion to cut some of the sweetness. I would also add more vegetables, and maybe even some salami.

I am so surprised at the reviews on this one.  I have been making this recipe for years and EVERYWHERE I bring it people always want the recipe.  The only thing I do is omit the salt and pepper but everything else stays and it is fabulous!
