I made this recipe in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I let the yeast bloom with the warm liquids and sugar in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the other ingredients. I did use melted butter instead of shortening only because I am out of Crisco right now AND I added a teaspoon of salt. I added the flour a half cup at a time up to four cups, then a quarter cup at a time until it was where it formed a solid ball without sticking to the bowl. I then kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. After the first rise, I rolled the dough into heaping 1/3 cup balls and plopped them into the greased cast iron skillet, then covered the with a dishtowel and let them rise until the doubled. I baked them at 400* for just about 17 minutes. These turned out absolutely wonderful. I was telling my husband these rolls reminded me of the "church lady rolls" I used to get at church dinner nights. They were light and fluffy and just wonderful. This absolutely was a success. Great dinner roll. MAKE SURE YOU ADD SALT.

I used this for Thanksgiving and every event since.  I get phone calls requesting me to make bread!!!!  I revised it just a little by doubling the sugar (my family like to extra sweet taste).  This is a five star receipe!!!*****

Contrary to what the description says, I found these rolls pretty easy to make.  I did not have self-raising flour so used plain flour with added baking powder.  I don't know whether it was due to this or the lack of kneading that the texture was more like cake than bread.  The rolls were sweet and tender, as specified, but a bit too crumbly for me.  There was nothing really wrong with them but I doubt I will make them again.

This recipe was easy to make; however, I did not find them light. They were sweet but I came up with a heavy consistency. The way you have to roll them out and cut them I had a feeling of more like biscuits. I may have misunderstood the directions. They were ok just not what I was looking for when compared to the description.

I have never used self rising flour and yeast together before.  I used butter in place of shortening.  That was my only ingredient change.  Rather than rolling out the dough and using a cutter, I simply divided the dough in twelve portions and allowed it to rise again in muffin tins.  Mine baked for about 18 minutes at 350.  I was surprised how dense, not heavy, but dense, they baked up.

I made these for Thanksgiving.  I've always brought the rolls, but everybody went on and on about these and asked for the recipe.  I saw some of the reviews said their rolls came out heavy, mine were light as thistle. I used my mixer to beat in the flour and I let it set overnight in the frig. (a full 9 hours)maybe that was the difference.  I used butter instead of shortening and I made my own self-rising flour by adding 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt per cup of flour.  I tripled the recipe and they were all gone!  I thought the idea of melting the butter into the milk and warm water was a grand time saving idea. These rolls will be a staple at our family get-togethers.

Ive never had much of luck with all things related to yeast (except pizza dough maybe), I tried these as I had a lot of self rising flour and yeast and wanted something savory. It came out more cake like, and yellow (perhaps coz of the margarine) and I am unsure what when wrong. I kept it over night (almost 12 hours) covered and the top of the dough had a crust (due to the chill in the fridge). It had a soggy, rather uncooked center and a dark browned crust on top. Would be great if someone told me how to do it right. Also, i sprinkled yeast on hot (slightly cooled) water and it didn't bloom /bubble so I stirred it into the water and it got all cloudy. And my milk- margarine mixture was hot though i let it to cool a bit before adding to the flour and yeast-water. Of course, I am no expert in bread making, so my rating doesn't really count.
