I baked the wings instead of bbq'd them, used an extra hot sauce and they were wonderful!  My husband thought the sauce could be a little thicker.

We made this yesterday.  Normally, I use "Frank's Hot Sauce." (not real spicy)  All that I had on hand yesterday was chicken thighs and "Tapatio Hot Sauce."  I also added a tsp. of garlic powder and two tsp. of red pepper flakes.  LORD HAVE MERCY!!  This has to be equivalent to sucking on a hot coal.  But absolutely delish.  Thanks.

My daughter Ashley is the hot wing, not to mention hot anything expert. Believe it or not, this is a taste she developed when she was a baby. She gave these a five star rating, however, the only change we made was to deep fry the wings in our fry daddy in lieu of grilling, as we like them really crispy. Thanks Beth!

The flavor of the sauce was great but it is a little thin (could be the hot sauce I used).  We grilled the wings but we like them crispier too, so will fry them next time we make this.

Made these for lunch and tweaked them a bit.  I saw that the sauce was not holding to the wings, so halfway through the cooking process, I breaded them.  Worked so much better.  I also added some seasoning to the breading so that it would have some more flavor when we bit into them...garlic powder, the cayenne suggested, anything that your family enjoys.    I have another recipe that I think I will continue to use, but thanks for the post.

Gave this 4 stars as is . . . but would consider this a 5-star recipe with my variation . . . I add about 1/3 cup honey to the hot sauce/butter mixture.  in addition to making the sauce taste really great, it will thicken the sauce and help it stick to the chicken.  Such a great, easy recipe!

It was good... I know That the whole family loved it but you have to be very picky about finding a good spicy sauce, you dont want to get one too sweet.

My family liked these a lot. I didn't change any ingredients. I did bake them in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes because it was to windy to grill them.

Thanks for all the helpful reviews on this recipe.
The sauce was very delicious, and the wings were very crispy after the deep fry.  I would definitely repeat this recipe again.

I've made wings like this for years on our propane grill.  This recipe is for those who prefer a grilled taste instead of breaded fried wing.  For those who say the sauce is too thin, here's a tip. Marinate the wings in the sauce over night or all day while at work.  Then, put the wings on the grill. While the wings are grilling, boil down the sauce in a small sauce pan about 1/3 until it thickens.  This also kills any contaminates from the raw chicken in the sauce and then brush the thickened sauce onto the grilled wings or put the wings in a bowl and pour the thickened sauce over them just before serving.   I sometimes split the sauce if I'm making a lot and use some for marinating and some for thickening that way the raw chicken never touches the thickened sauce.  It's just a suggestion.  I use Red Devil sauce.  I think it's the best.  If you like it hotter add Tabasco to taste.  You can also add Italian dressing for a spicy but not hot wing.  Okay, Blah, blah, blah.  I should have just posted my own recipe.  duh.  Maybe I will

About 20 years ago, I ran the kitchen in a biker-bar; every Friday, we gave away wings for Happy Hour from 4:00-7:00pm. I usually fried (deep-fat commercial fryer) between 50-70 dozen wings. This is the sauce we made, minus the freshly cracked pepper and the cayenne. There were never any wings left!
The proportions of butter to Frank's Red-Hot sauce as given in the recipe were what we used for "Spicy". For "Mild", we used a 1:3 ratio.

Loved it! Very simple, and wings came out nice and juicy with just the right amount of heat. The recipe makes more sauce than what is needed, so next time I'll probably half it. Other than that...I've found my hot wing recipe!

I baked my wings in the oven until almost done, then soaked them in the sauce for about an hour or so, it seems the sauce sticks to the pre-baked wings better, then I finished cooking them on the grill basting w/more sauce until done.   They were the bomb!

Good recipe but one comment. When "lightly oiling" the grill that has been subjected to high heat only one thing happens the oil flashes off immediately. Try instead lightly spraying the chicken with Pam or your favorite brand of cooking spray. Chicken, in my experience, is the worst for sticking to a hot grill.

This is my choice for sauce with the recipe, but I deep fried the chicken. I was also told that the drummettes were better than the wings, so I get a big bag of those. To fry first, I mixed 1 cup of flour and added some salt and pepper. I heated oil in a cast iron pan to 375 with a thermometer and, after coating in flour, deep fried each batch until golden brown about 15 minutes flipping once. Then, I made the sauce as is on the recipe and drizzled over the wings. It makes 2 fried batches. But, by the way the people eat these when I make them it makes more like 3 servings instead of 6!

So, I have never made wings before (hot wing, buffalo wings - whichever you'd call these) and I decided I would start with a basic recipe. Wow, these wings are kicking! My mouth was still on fire about five minutes after I finished eating them! (But it could be the brand of hot sauce I used too) When coating them I did throw the wings into the pan with the sauce and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it so the sauce would stick more. Otherwise, followed to a T and will definitely make these again if I want some hot wings in a hurry! Thanks for posting!

I am from Buffalo NY where wings orginated, and this is the sauce we use here, minus the black pepper. The wings can be deep fried, baked to crispness, or as in this recipe grilled. Please shake gently, or the lid will blow off your container when you are shaking them up.

This recipe was a huge hit! It was quick and easy and all my guests were drooling over it. 
I think the trick was to use Franks Red Hot Sauce Buffalo Wing sauce. I used this recipe 2 times and used a different no name hot sauce the second time and it didn't turn out as well. 
But great BBQ recipe when i'm cooking for sports games!

I couldn't believe how great these were, and I had no problem getting them nice and crispy on the grill (it was well worth standing outside in the cold 3 below zero today).

I loved this recipe. It was easy, quick and made almost no mess. The best part was it was delicious! Make sure you make extra sauce because it is REALLy good.

Can't complain about the product.  The word basic is in the title and that is what you get.  Pretty good wings.

I combined this with another recipe I had that adds a few other things to make a sauce.

Not bad for a quickie. This is one of those "shelf specials" for my collection. You know, the kind where you remember much too late for a quick run to the supermarket, so you're stuck with what's on hand

I wish "gluten free" was listed in the title! I was combing through the website, looking for GF wing options (Super Bowl party with GF friends coming), and this seemed the simplest option. Don't be fooled, though; it is terrific! Easy to make, hard to keep around. ;)
