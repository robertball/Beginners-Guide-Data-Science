These are good, but the coconut extract is a bit too much. I'd cut it back to 1/2 tsp next time. I also messed up and added the cocoa right into the mixture, rather than saving it to roll the balls in . . . oops! I made these at my son's request, and he likes them. He took a baggie full of them to the gym with him tonight. Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I did not have ground flax, so I just added some extra oatmeal.  I also did not have coconut extract, so I added a teaspoon of coconut oil.  I chopped up the chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup raisins.  Finally, we found that cocoa was too bitter, so we rolled them in protein powder. Yummy!

This is a great recipe.  They are tasty and very filling.  I did not use chocolate chips in the recipe, instead I used dried cranberries. I also substituted the coconut extract for vanilla and they came out very well.  I will be making these again.

Made exacly as the recipe shows. I will absolutely make these again - Made for Daughters Volleyball Tournament - they were a great for an energy pick up the girls needed when they had to play four matches in a row at the end of the day. Made a huge difference in the team's energy level - All the teenaged girls LOVED them. And the parents that tried them as well were amazed how good they tasted. Made with "Vega One" protein power -due to a lactose issue with a team mate. I have been requested by the team manager to bring to every tournament for the remainder of the season. I think that that speaks volume to how good these were - Thank you Bonnie for sharing this excellent Recipe!!!!

Awesome! I used my Ninja to pulse the oats then added the chia, ground flax, chocolate chips, a chunk of coconut oil, vanilla protein powder, a handful of raisins, and the cocoa. I made it into a ball and refrigerated it for about 30 min before making individual balls. I like how the cocoa is incorporated. My teens will love these!

I love these and so does my family! Only changes I made were I didnt' use coconut extract I used coconut oil and no cocoa powder, but I don't think it needed either. I froze them in the freezer for about an hour and then they get nice and hard and don't stick together quite as much. I will keep making these for sure!

Didn't have coconut on hand so I added raspberry extract and raspberry jam instead.

Note to self, use mini chocolate chips or smash regular size chips  so the balls stay together  better.

Pretty darned good.  : )

These were great but I did not use the powder milk, or flax, or chia. I tried dipping them in ground coffee but it tasted a little too gritty. The coco flakes and the choc chips, pb (natural creamy unrefrigerated), oats, and honey were a go!
