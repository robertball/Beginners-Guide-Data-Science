This is just for the sauce as I used the Basic Crepes recipes from Allrecipes for the crepes, I doubled the crepe recipe, with a 1/3 cup measure yielded 11 crepes.
I omitted the salt and reduced the boullion cube to 1, used 1 tbsp each sherry and sour cream and added 1/2 cup of water on the end to make it saucier. I increased the seasonings and added sage and minced garlic. Next time I would double the mushrooms as well.
We really enjoyed this, it reminded me of The Magic Pan from when I was a child.
I made this recipe for the Allrecipes Allstar Canada April challenge #ARFaceless

I liked it but the men thought the crepes were too sweet.  If I make it again I will omit the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this recipe a lot. I had some cooked shredded chicken to use and it worked great. I used double the mushrooms (1 lb.). I had to add a little water to make the crepes thin enough and had to add a little butter to the pan prior to cooking each crepe. The recipe made 5 large crepes which I filled generously with the mushroom chicken mixture. Topped with the reserved mushroom mixture and baked for 20 minutes at 350 because it had cooled by the time I put it all together. Sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley just before serving. Lovely presentation and tasty.
