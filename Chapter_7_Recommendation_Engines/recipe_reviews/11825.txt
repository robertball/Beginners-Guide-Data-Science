First of all I have been making fresh pasta for about a year. I have had wonderful success with flour, eggs and salt. That is it. That is the recipe for pasta. FLOUR EGGS AND A PINCH OF SALT. Everyone who critized this recipe needs to relax and read ALL of the directions. Fresh pasta is one of the easiest things to make. You must incorporate all the ingredients until smooth and then LET IT REST. You can roll it out with a rolling pin and of course a pasta machine is faster. It just  seems to me that many people are ready to criticize the recipe and not take responsibility for the chance that maybe they did it wrong.  Please remember that sometimes it is user error and not the recipe.

This is a good general recipe for pasta.  After reading a variety of the reviews its clear that most didn't mix the pasta long enough to allow the gluton in the flour to do their stuff and then allow it to rest for a half hour.  Also, unless you have been making pasta for years, you will not have enough experience on how thin to roll it out.  Pasta is generally very thin that is difficult to get to without a machine.  I prefer to use 3 eggs and 2 egg yolks with a pinch of salt with that amount of ap flour.

this is a great basic pasta recipe, one i have used for almost a year now. it works best in casseroles, though, because the all purpose flour can kind of break apart. without a machine, one can roll it out fairly thin but probably not thin enough for a pasta dish. 

for pasta that holds together very well, use semolina flour instead. 

and a pinch of salt never hurts.

Easier way to do it is to combine 1 part egg 3 parts flour to a food processor and blend till it kneads into a ball. add more flour if it's wet. set aside the ball. repeat till you get as many balls as you desire. put it into the fridge or let it sit for 30 mins (or more). following which you use a pasta machine and roll out the noodle. i don't see myself kneading and using a rolling pin!

Today was the very first time I have ever made homemade noodles, and my 11yo son and I made this recipe with no problems! We followed the advice of one reviewer who suggested to use 4C of flour with the 6 eggs, and that was perfect. I can't imagine using 6C flour. 

We used our new Marcato Atlas pasta roller/cutter and made flat fettucine noodles for use in turkey noodle soup. 

The resting period really made a difference in the dough. It was smooth and substantial. The noodles did puff a bit in the soup and were very, very tasty.

Without a pasta machine, I found it difficult to get the pasta thin enough.  The recipe itself was easy and fairly tasty, but the presentation was not very nice.

Fresh pasta tastes so much better than the boxed stuff. I added a dash of salt to the pasta recipe and used my Kitchen Aide pasta maker.

The mixture of only flour and eggs make a mound of flakes, this was a really bad recipe. I had to add olive oil and water to make it work. The adding of theses two ingredients work great the dough turned out perfectly when I added the ingredients. So I wouldn't ever use this recipe ever again!

With a pasta machine, this recipe worked well.  Would like to try adding spices to it the next time for more tasty pasta.

Delicious!  I recommend starting out with less flour for the well, though- maybe 4 cups and add more if needed. I always end up adding more eggs because it is too dry.

Not worth making without a pasta machine, but well worth it otherwise.  Egg size makes a big difference, so be ready to adjust.  Italians use this pasta recipe, but Italian eggs have less egg white than american eggs, I usually use 4 c flour, 4 yolks, 3 whites.  Make sure to put plenty of salt in the pasta water when you cook this, otherwise it will be bland. Makes great lasagna, fettucini, ravioli.

If you don't have a pasta machine, don't bother with this, it's so hard to roll out, I only did a third of the recipe, and I'm already tired!

First time I made this recipe, I had WAY more pasta than I knew what to do with. I have found the ratio of 1-egg to 1-cup flour plus a little salt works for any size meal needed, just adjust as needed. I do use a pasta machine, and it always comes together during the rolling out stage, although it looks like a mess till then! About to try it as Ravioli, so wish me luck! HEHE

The secret to good pasta is Italian "00" flour.  (I had to order it online but grocery stores might sell it in larger cities.)  Taste and texture is completely different with the right flour.  This recipe also needs at least a tsp of salt and a tsp of olive oil.  The directions doesn't specify time, but it must be kneaded for at least 10-15 minutes to get a good texture.  Squeezing the dough like a stress ball can help to loosen it up when it gets too stiff to knead "properly."  I use a pasta machine to roll out the dough (wouldn't bother making it without it) and I only cook the spaghetti for 30 seconds so that it's nice and chewy.

For those who don't work with flour often, you should use a quality flour, I like King Arthur. Also, take into consideration the humidity when adding the flour, If the humidity is high you will most likely need all of the flour, if the humidity is low, you can add the flour in parts to see if the consistancy is correct. Just adding all the flour and mixing it and working it too much will produce a tough pasta.  It is much like making bread, I sift mine first and just add as much as is needed to make a nice dough. Let it rest and the rest will be somewhat easier if you don't have a pasta machine. Humidity matters!

this is a great basic pasta recipe. It turned out pretty food with just a garlic buttersauce with pepperchinis(?). I added a littel water to the dough while kneeding to hold it together a littel better. And be prepared for a lot of rolling if your doing it by hand.

Easy basic pasta dough recipe.  I had no problems with the recipe but did add a teaspoon or so of salt. I suggest you hold back on some of the flour.  Flour is different depending on the dampness in the air so you have to consider you may need less or more flour depending on the day.  Start with 1 cup less and knead more in if the dough is too sticky.  Also flour can absorb liquid differently depending on if you use bleached, unbleached, bread or wheat flour.  You want the dough to be "tacky" but not stick to your hands.  The dough should pull away from your hands. The recipe also does not indicate what size eggs so that can also be a factor for those who had issues making this recipe. This dough went through my pasta roller easily and did not tear when making ravioli.  DO BE SURE to let the dough rest.  I make mine the day before I use it.

This was a very simple recipe. I tried to make one serving only, using 1 egg and 1 cup of flour. It was too dry so I added one more egg and 1 Tbsp of water. That was perfect. It actually made enough fettuccine width noodles for two people. This was my first time making fresh pasta. I rolled it out as thin as I could and used a pizza cutter to cut long strips and this worked just fine. I cooked it for 7 minutes.

I made these noodles with my girls today just for fun. We found the dough a little hard to roll out but not impossible. They were very good with our spaghetti sauce and fun to know we made the Whole meal our selves from scratch. We were very proud!

I handroll all of my pasta and this was a decent recipe.  I don't use the "well" method and this still worked fine.  Egg pastas tend to be more sticky so you need a floured surface to roll on.    Don't use the "well" and flour your surface.  If you are impatient about rolling, don't roll it as thin and use a pizza cutter to cut it in squares.  You'll have an orrichelli sized pasta great for cream or tomato sauces.

This was my first attempt at homemade pasta and it was rough!   I tried everything the other raters suggested but to no avail. It was dry and flaky, so I persisted like someone said  and tried to spend more time with the dough. It didn't work, so I tried the food processor with the dough attachment...a little bit of olive oil. A little better...but it was still way way too dry. I can't imagine how this recipe every has a moist dough with all that flour. I haven't given up. But guess I need to read more about it.

Wonderful Noodles.  I followed the recipe and they worked out fine.

I cut the recipe slightly, 4 cups of flour / 4 eggs / pinch of salt / a little water.  Separated into two dough balls.  Kneaded each one for a long time until it was tough and springy, be patient.  I wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them on the counter to rest.  Dough must not dry out!  Finally I cut my dough balls in half (re-wrapped unused to remain moist) and fed it through my cheap pasta roller.

This is a tried and true basic pasta recipe that I've used for over 40 years.  I favor using my mother's rolling pin but once in awhile I dig out my trusty pasta machine!!

kind of tough - we used this to make ravioli and it worked - but it was hard to work with and the dough turned out chewy.

I just used 4 cups of flour as reccommended by another reviewer. You definitely need a pasta machine, which I don't have. In which case, it probably would have turned out a lot better.

Thank you!  This recipe worked great!  I followed the suggestions to start with 4 cups of flour and 6 eggs.  Also added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp olive oil as I found in other recipes.  By reducing the flour I could add it as needed when I worked with it.  It seems like some people that reviewed this recipe may have had altitude/humidity problems.  Regardless, my family has food allergies and I needed to be able to make homemade ravioli.  This pasta recipe had the perfect texture and taste for ravioli.  It even freezes well.  Again, thank you Holly!

This is the traditional Italian way to make pasta. No oil, no water; just flour and eggs.  This is the way that I learned to make it in Rome and have made it this way dozeens of times, without a single problem.. The trick is to knead it well, until the dough is smooth like a baby's bottom. Rest it and then roll it out. If you are using a pasta machine you neeed to pass it a couple times through each of the settings, starting with the thickest one down to the final thickness you want. This extra action actually kneads it some more so that it is elastic and won't break apart.  If you are using a rolling pin roll it out, fold it over and roll it out again.  Repeat until you can easily roll it out to the right thickness.

My first time making pasta and it was very easy and my family loved it. I made 1/2 a batch which was perfect for 4 of us for shrimp in creamy tomato sauce.  I  rolled it by hand and that worked very well.

I found this dough more difficult to work with and the portions far too large for our household of two.

It pales in comparison to the texture of the semolina pasta. Good, but not great.

Thank you very much for a simple, fool-proof recipe for homemade pasta. I've never made my own before, so I was a little nervous at the beginning.  But it was just like making bread - you need to get a feel for what the texture should be. My first few attempts weren't very attractive, but they were tasty, and I learned from each batch I made.   Now I can make this recipe by feel - I also use 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks and gradually blend in the flour by hand.  I don't have a high-tech kitchen, so my whole setup consists of a wooden block, a bowl, a rolling pin, and a pizza cutter.   It works!

For those home cooks who say it is only good in casseroles. I suggest maybe rest the pasta in plastic wrap for at least 30 minutes on the counter. Then cut the disc into 1/4's then roll out on board or in pasta machine folding rolled dough like an envelope the first 3 times to create a strong gluten structure.

My first attempt at making fresh pasta using my new Kitchen Aid attachment and used this recipe.  Was a little messy.  The egg, when cracked into my flour mound, overflowed off of my board so next time I will use a bowl to contain my mess. Also, I only used large eggs and found I need an etra one. Added Italian seasoning.  Turned out yummy! Will definitely make again!

The amounts seem off...I did a half recipe and had to use 5 eggs with 3 cups of flour. I used large eggs and after the first 3, it looked like bread crumbs.
