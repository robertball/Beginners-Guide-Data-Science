Made it for the 4th of July picnic. Every raved about it. I would just add a it more ginger but other than that "it's a keeper" in the recipe folder.

Have been making this for  years and it is so accurate.  Most Huli  Huli recipes leave out the pineapple

Made this for a luau party. Since it was a potluck party I laid the boneless chicken tenders and boneless thighs in a couple baking dishes and baked at 400 until the biggest piece was 165*

I thought this  was a very good recipe. I marinated it for about 5-6 hours and in my opinion is was not enough. Next time I will do a full 24 hours.

Love this recipe. Just used boneless breasts and they did great. Next time going to plan ahead a bit more and marinate overnight. Great Polynesian taste. Might also increase the marinade recipe and set some aside for a sauce when serving. Can't wait to try it again

I loved this! I saved some of the marinade to use with chicken kabobs at a later date. Hubs thought it was good, but felt it needed a kick (he says that about everything though). I served this with Caesar Salad Supreme (also from the site) and grilled bread, and it made a delicious summer meal. Thanks Mark, for sharing your recipe!

I have made both recipes on this site for the Huli Huli Chicken.  They are both phenomenal.  Please make  the recipes exactly according to the directions. The chicken was flavorful and beautifully glazed.  Slow cooking on the grill is a must.  The marinade time is much better after 24 hours.

Ended up marinating mine for 2 days because that's when I had time to put the sauce together. Used chicken thighs (what I had available) and added a little soy sauce to the chicken, just to help ensure the chicken was seasoned. Absolutely delicious! This is a definite keeper!!

My wife and I try to eat very healthy and so we eat a lot of chicken breasts. We only used breasts for this recipe. This was a very good recipe and a super pleasant change we needed. We loved it!

Very good.  Quite a hit with the family.  The only change I see making in the future when I make this again is that instead leaving the pineapples as crushed from the can I will pur√©e them as I make the marinade.  Should make for a more even coating when I baste them while cooking.

I followed the recipe and froze it in portions in the freezer for quick meals. I pulled it out in the morning and let it sit on the counter all day and then barbecued it and served it over rice.
All three kids ate it and seemed to like it.

Changes made:  added more brown sugar, say 1/2 cup, 1 tsp of crushed red peppers and 1 TBS of minced fresh ginger.  Gave it 4 stars b/c there is a flavor that is missing.  Haven't found it, yet!

This marinade is superb.  Have tried many, but this was the first that gained a 5-star hubby review.  You will love it.
