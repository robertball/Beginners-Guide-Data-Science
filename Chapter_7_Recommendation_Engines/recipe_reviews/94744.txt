Not bad. Used homemade chili. This gets very messy.

Hubby is my hotdog eater and this was just right for him. Great way to help use up some of the chili we made the other night.

Believe it or not, but my favorite food is the hotdog!  This is a really simple but good recipe.  Perfect for warm weather!
