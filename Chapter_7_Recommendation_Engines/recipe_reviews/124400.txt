I used 1.5 pounds of hamburger and cooked for an hour and a half at 350.  All of the hamburger fit into four peppers and I put in more cheese than 2 tablespoons (estimate about 1/4 cup) into the meat mixture.  I didn't blanch the peppers ahead of time as they become to mushy.  I would recommend putting in more pepper than recipe calls for as this will add more flavor.  I basted the peppers a couple of times during the cooking to keep the tops of the meat mixture from drying out.

For a quicker version cook the meat before hand, not all the way just lightly brown it (some may still be a little pink) and instead of rice if you don't like it (my husband doesn't) use crushed Ritz crackers.  Cook onion with the,I used half a medium onion.  Also cooked meat with soy sauce, about 1 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp red pepper and 2 tsp of garlic powder.  Then mix everything together including about 1/2 cheese and shove it in the peppers.  Will be done in about 30 mins.  You may want to blanch the peppers longer if you like them softer, but we like them still a little crunchy!  Also, poured a little (maybe 1/4 cup)chicken broth in the bottom of the pan to help "steam" the peppers and adds a little flavor too!

BW says best stuffed peppers she has ever had.  Made exactly as the recipe specifies, except that I cut the peppers in half lengthwise instead of cutting off the tops.  Cutting in half keeps the peppers from falling over while baking, and also wastes less of the pepper than cutting off the whole top. Since this also exposes more of the meat to oven heat, they also cook faster. And it took an extra tablespoon of grated cheese to cover the peppers. I also microwaved each pepper for 3 min instead of blanching. I had to sprinkle mine with salt to bring out all the flavor.  BW says perfect without added salt.  Recommend that you make these with just the salt as specified in the recipe.  Diners can then salt to their own tastes.  A keeper.

BF loved this recipe - I did as well.  The worcestershire sauce gives the meat a kick that I think would be missing otherwise.  One thing to note: poke a hole in the bottom of the pepper.  I did by accident on one of them - the other retained all of the grease from the meat that poured out when the pepper was cut into.  Very messy!  Also I cooked the peppers for 1hr - added the cheese and cooked for an additional 10-15mins - as I had no idea when the meat would be done - came out perfect - not overcooked at all.

Wonderful! I did not precook the peppers and they turned out fine after one hour in the oven. I also used 1/2 tblsp Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of the salt and pepper and added about a clove of minced garlic. This is going into my regular recipe rotation.

My husband swore up and down that he didn't like stuffed peppers until I made him try this recipe one night. He loved it and so did I. It was quick and easy to make and cooked up perfectly. I agree with other reviewers that it is difficult to tell if the meat is done. I just take a small spoon and scoop the meat in one of the peppers to the side a little to see down in the middle. I've never had it not done after the recommended baking time. Very good recipe.

My husband and I enjoyed this, but both agreed that it needed something morre.  Perhaps more spice.  It is easier to cook, top and eat these if you cut the peppers lengthwise and makes 4 cups rather than the traditional two.

Yum! This was so good and very easy to make! I added a little bit of garlic and basil but I add that to everything! I did not blanch the peppers I just put them in raw and after and hour they turned out great! I will for sure be making these again.

Fast and easy, and served the two of us quite well, just like the recipe calls for. The flavours were excellent, used extra rice and there and it turned out great. Didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, so I turned to my adventurous side and settled on asiago cheese. Try it, if you like a bit of sharpness in there.

Remember when making these to put slits in the
bottom of the pepper so the fat does not lay in the bottom of the pepper.

I make mine exactly as nccooker has detailed in his comment.  Not only does cutting the pepper lengthwise keep them from falling over, it leaves more pocket to stuff with the meat mixture and more suface to add cheese.  I also precook the peppers a little in micro.  No need to deal with boiling water and pots.

These were very good.  I used homemade marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and red, yellow & orange bell peppers instead of green (for some reason, we just don't like green peppers)!  I also added some shredded mozzarella cheese on top.  Hubby said that the filling needed a little bit of a kick of something.  He suggested adding some pecorino romano cheese instead of the cheddar next time, which I will do.

Very good, don't change a thing.  I don't boil peppers, but cut them in half lengthwise and remove the tops-makes them easier to eat in my opinion.  I do like to cook the ground beef first and rid of any grease  I also like a little parmsean cheese on top the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Delish

I used yellow peppers and I first browned the meat with the chopped onion, fresh garlic, a touch of cumin, red pepper flakes, and  a sprinkle of basil and italian seasoning. I also cooked the rice halfway in bowling water before mixing it in.  I cut them lengthwise, stuck them for 30 mins in the oven and they came out lovely

Although this is a decent recipe, it omits the fact that you must brown the meat before stuffing the pepper and you might want to cook the rice before stuffing as well.  It was tasty when properly prepared.

Excellant!! I made enough for 4 and used instant whole grain brown rice.  I also microwaved instead of oven cooking it and that eliminated the blanching!  Also done in 20 minutes which makes it something you can whip up after work very easily!

These peppers were AMAZING! I followed the advice of others and sliced the peppers lenghwise so that they would cook faster. I also poked a small hole in the bottom to allow the juices to run through. Cover the dish with foil while they are in the oven so that they will be "steamed" making the peppers softer. I browned the meat first, but I think next time I will completely cook it before baking the peppers. Like other reviewers, I added spaghetti sauce to the meat mixture and poured the rest on top. Great recipe!

Very good.  I pre-cooked meat and added more cheese.  I also seasoned with garlic powder, creole seasoning, and paprika.  Will add into regular rotation.

This recipe has perfect ingredients and proportions.  I also cut my peppers lengthwise.  I used a tip and put a hole in my peppers to drain the grease.  I mix the remaining tomato sauce with some trimmings from the pepper tops and cook it in the microwave. This way the sauce doesn't get mixed with the grease and works just fine for the gravy for the mashed pototes.  I think that people who change everything in a recipe are only showing off.  I think they should enter their own recipes.

I cut these lengthwise and zap em in the microwave for 3 min as someone suggested. I keep everything the same except use brown rice (I cook it first or it's hard) and add about a tablespoon of garlic and some Montreal Steak Seasoning (like a teaspoon). They're usually done in a half hour. I like cutting them lengthwise cuz they cook quicker and it is way easier to tell when they're done.

Was very yummy. The peppers came out a little plain and they were just sort of there I would suggest a little bit of spice for them after you shock them. I did take out the rice and replace it like Dezaray suggested, my boyfriend loved  em! I would make a minor suggestion though. before you mix the egg in with everything, spice the meat the way you like it with or without the sauce I didn't use the sauce I used a mix of things I had in my pantry

I added some extra onion, cabbage, and tomato sauce to the mix and supplemented egg whites and turkey sausage in place of the original requirements.  I will definitely make this again.  It's easy and delicious!

These were so good.  The peppers got a tiny bit soggy, so I think they would be fine without the blanching.  Made them with ground turkey and brown rice, no worcestershire because I was out of it, and the flavor was great.  Will definitely make these again!

Really good and very easy.  I made three peppers with just over a pound of  80% lean ground beef.  I set them up in a deep loaf plan and cooked them just over an hour.  They looked a little greasy but weren't.  Yum!

Very good! I used a red and orange pepper and split them length-wise so they would lay flat.  I added more onion, about 1/4 cup, minced garlic and italian seasoning to the meat. I also salt and peppered the peppers before stuffing them.  Great recipe!

Stuffed peppers for two is a GREAT idea, except for the fact that they are SOOO good that I have to make a double batch. I use the tip of poking a hole in the bottom to let the grease drain, but that then mixes with the tomato sauce poured in the bottom of the pan. I think in the future I will cook the remainder of the tomato sauce separate to pour over the peppers when they are served. GREAT recipe!

Yummy! These remind me of my dear grandmother. Stuffed peppers were one of her favorite meals. I normally use whatever I have on hand to make dinner. I didn't have quick rice, but I had some Success Bag rice. I cut the bag open and dumped the rice into the meat mixture. I cooked the peppers about an hour but the rice was not cooked. I added some more sauce on top of each pepper and cooked for another twenty minutes. They were delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe with me.

Followed recipe just as written, using the tomato sauce with basil, oregano and garlic added in- this gave it a little more flavor.  They were great with 96% lean beef, and low fat too!!  I will definitely make again!

Definitely need to precook the rice or it is too crunchy and ruins the pleasure of the pepper. I used a white Ital. Cheese mix for my topping -- almost close to what my grandmother used to serve. Will serve again with minor corrections.

These were very good and have a lot of potential.  I do think it needs something to give it a little more of a kick.  Maybe some dry mustard and a little italian seasoning.  I will definitely try it again with a few extras.

I am hopeless in the kitchen, but this recipe is so easy even I could follow it.  The taste was great.  The only thing I changed was I used ground sirloin, rather than ground beef and browned the meat beforehand, so I could drain the grease.

Normally I love stuffed peppers but this recipe was just ... so-so. I used one red pepper and one green pepper...the red one tasted a little better- in my humble opinion. I think next time I will add some corn to the mix...less meat...not so sure!

I had never tried stuffed peppers but I'm glad I did after trying this recipe! I cut the recipe in half (just for myself) and substituted the tomato sauce with canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have the sauce in the pantry. I also added some basil and clubhouse italiano seasoning on top of the cheese when you put it on top in the last 5 mins of the recipe. I would absolutely recommend this recipe to anyone!

Really like this, and it can all be approximated. I only had regular rice, so I cooked it first. Added about 2 teaspoons of Tabasco, which seemed hot (tasted before adding egg) but then went away when cooked. Added 1 T of chopped bottled garlic to the pan with the beef and onions, and used 3/4 lb beef because I found some wide pappers. Upped the salt and pepper, too. But the concept works well. Extra sauce from the can I just poured into the dish. I also cooked uncovered. Didn't make a difference. Pre-cooked my peppers in the micro for 4 minutes because I like them very soft. Yum yum.

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe! My husband & I don't have any kids yet & it's tough finding recipes for just two.  This was wonderful & it made the perfect amount for us.  These are very delicious & taste like the ones my mom used to make!

I use a toothpick to poke holes in the bottom of the peppers to let some of the juice/grease drain out.  We love this recipe!

This was very good!  Added garlic, used a whole small onion, skipped the Worcestershire sauce and used pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  Also added basil.  I cooked the meat beforehand and baked for 30 min.  I also did not blanch the peppers.  We like them a little crunchy.

REALLY good! Grew up on stuffed peppers but couldn't quite get the right texture, this worked perfectly. I did substitute mozzarella for the cheddar. I had a little extra mixture left over and they made really good meatballs to freeze. Thanks!

Very good, but it made way to much.  We ended up getting more peppers and making another batch later on in the week.

Great recipe!  Everybody loved this!  Definitely will make again!  The only changes I made was to add more rice and cover it in tomato soup.  We love all the sauce it makes to go over our mashed potatoes too!

These were very good. Made a double batch (4 peppers) so I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef, adds a bit more flavor. I did not blance my peppers, but I did poke a hole in them. Amazing to see how much fat came out. The meat was still moist. Also added the steak season, and added a bit of salt and pepper. (taste) I did not have qucik rice so I cooked the rice, about 1/2 to 3/4 done and added it to the mix. Turned out perfect, and the rice was done.

This was great. I didn't blanch the peppers due to lack of time, and for the same reason cooked most of the ground beef before filling pepper but it still turned out delicious!

This was very easy I did it for 4 peppers 2 green and 2 yellow.  I also poked a hole to allow the meats juices to escape, I used ground sirloin beef and vidalia onion. Taste was AMAZING. It's been awile since I made stuffed peppers and I did not want to use my same'ol recipe and this was PERFECT for me an my man.

Awesome recipe! I actually doubled it because my bf and I are looking for dinners that make good leftover lunches (proportions double well and it reheats well in microwave). I used MorningStar Grillers crumbles instead of ground beef to make it vegetarian, pre-cooked quinoa instead of rice and 1t of soy sauce instead of salt. I also added 1T minced garlic, 1t cumin, 1t paprika, and cut the peppers in half lengthwise. Baked for 30 min since I didn't use ground beef. Perfect!

My boyfriend loved this dish kept saying that it was perfect but I think dprobably change a few things. Im not that much of a ground beef lover so Id switch it to ground sausage and maybe add some flavor to the tomatoe sauce...also use mozarella cheese too but not a bad dish by any means.Ill make it again but next time with my changes

Very good and tasty! It was nice to make a meal designed for 2 with no leftovers for a change. Made with ground turkey instead of beef, and instant brown rice instead of white just to make it a little more healthy.

This recipe is great as is, but I also made some changes and liked it even more.  For a more mexican taste I used taco sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I added about 1/4 cup of mexican blend cheese.  I also added a little corn to mine.  I put the peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes and then put them in a small casserole pan in the oven and add a can of chicken broth at the bottom so they don't burn.  I put them in for 55 minutes, and after the 55 minutes I take them out and press down the meat with a big spoon and drain out most of the liquid so they aren't as runny.  I then put a little chesse on top and put them back in the oven for 5 minutes! tasted great!

I don't really care for stuffed peppers, but I made these for my hubby and he said they were the best he ever had.  I loved that it only made 2, so that meant not a lot of leftovers.  I did add a little more cheese and I baked them for about 70 minutes total.

This made a very nice little meal for my husband & me. I substituted ground turkey breast for the ground beef. The filling reminded me of meat loaf (which is a good thing for us!). I served Zatarain's Yellow Rice as a side (there's rice in the meat mixture, but not so much to be afraid of using it as a side).

The only thing I would change next time is maybe adding some extra tomato sauce to the meat - I like these types of dishes to have a lot of sauce (personal preference).

Great recipe for two.  I used red peppers and other than that went by the book.  However, I used jasmine rice, uncooked.  My personal opinion is cook the rice first; it was still hard after an hour in the oven.  Other than that, a keeper!  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but I did use soy burger crumbles in place of meat, and long-cooking rice instead of instant. Since I cooked the rice in my rice cooker and then put it in the oven, I was afraid it would be overdone, but it was just fine. Really such a simple recipe and so yummy! I will definitely keep this one.

The flavor was pretty good, so was ease of prep. Cooking time was off.  I kept it in the oven for a little over an hour and the beef was still a little pink.  Also, another problem I had is that when we cut into these the plate filled with a pool of liquid.  I guess it was fat from the beef (and I used 93% lean ground beef) other than that I can't figure out where it came from.  You would think the uncooked rice would have soaked it up.  My favorite part was the cheese on top which is not a good reason to have these again as I can put cheese on top of a lot of things.

This is a great dish and very easy to make esp. when you are busy. Prep time is minimum and you can just stick it in the oven while you attend to other things around the house. No need to boil and blench peppers. Just fill them up raw. 1 hour in the oven leaves them thoroughy cooked but still a little crunchy. Add some red chilli powder, parsley and garlic to spice up the taste.

My boyfriend loves green peppers, so when I came across this recipe, I had to try it!  Since it's a very filling meal, I decided to cut the peppers in half and filled them open-faced.  Will definitely make again.

I have made these peppers for years now and my man LOVES them. Normally he thinks I should use more spices, yet, never says that when I cook the peppers. I blanch the peppers, use ingredients listed, do not add additional ingredients that are not listed. I do increase beef, cheese, rice, sauce, etc. since I buy BIG peppers, in turn, I increase the bake time. The rice is never crunchy! I don't poke holes in bottom to release grease. Reason, I cook longer, cooking longer = less grease. This recipe is awesome the way it is!!! I suppose if you want meal to be done quicker, slicing in half isn't a bad idea or if you're using male peppers since they only have 3 bumps on bottom and do not sit up well. However, I always buy female peppers (4 bumps) since they sit up well. Try with ingredients listed, don't add this and that, play with the ingredients listed and you'll be satisfied with the amazing results. I've never had one person say it needed more of ... anything. I've given this recipe out to many!!!

Very good!  No need to blanch the peppers though.  I did zap the onions in the microwave for 30 seconds to tender them up a bit before cooking.

Love this recipe, and used it for meatloaf as well! Tonight I'm using this recipe for meatloaf and can't remember if I should pour remaining tomato sauce over the top, like for the peppers. Guess I"ll find out soon, I didn't and it's covered in the oven.

The easiest stuffed pepper recipe I've come across and DELISH!  Most make you brown the meat first.  There's only two of us but I doubled the recipe as we like leftovers. Only changes I made were instant brown rice and ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Also added some garlic powder which I think complimented the flavor nicely.  Seemed a little liquidy when raw but cooked it was perfect!  Thank you!

Made this following the exact directions and found it to be very bland - tastes like meatloaf baked in peppers.  If I were to make it again I would cook the hamburg first, with additional spices to give it a bit of a kick, and omit the egg.  Even my husband, who doesn't care for alot of spice, found it to be too bland for his taste.   For those who found the rice too hard - use instant rice.

I doubled the recipe.  Cut the peppers lengthwise, did not add the cheese to the meat mixture ( sprinkled it on top at end ) and basted several times while cooking.  Turned out very tasty; also good reheated for lunch the next day.  Served with mashed potatoes and some fresh fruit. Thank you for posting.

Turned out delicious! Will definitely be making again. Had to substitute Campbell's tomato soup for tomato sauce since I thought I had some at home but I was out. It still turned out wonderfully!

I made one red pepper and one green pepper. The red pepper was far better and neither was cheesy enough. This is a good base recipe but I will definitely make changes to it next time.

A good recipe, and I suspect a very dependable one, too. I'll use it again, maybe even with visitors. Very filling meal!  I had accidentally cooked double the meat, so I doubled the recipe, and was able to make a little meatloaf with the extra. Next time, I'll add veggies or beans, too.

Peppers were kind of bland, steaming instead of par boiling might take care of that issue.

i skipped the cheese because i made these hungarian style to go with Beth's Scalloped Cabbage. after reading all the reviews i sliced the peppers in half, nuked them for 3 mins, stuffed with ground  turkey ( to cut back on grease) but added more seasoning to make up for the lack of beef flavor (beef bouillon, hungarian paprika, garlic), instant brown rice,  and added some lemon juice and ketchup to the sauce. for a hungarian version i will use vinegar instead of lemon juice and add brown sugar. these took 30 mins for me but next time i will uncover for the last 15 mins as the stuffing was a bit too "wet" for my liking. there are different  versions of stuffed peppers in various cultures and this is a nice base to start with. you could also make these mexican style with different seasonings, leftover mexican rice, and corn or italian style with oregano, basil, parmesan, and mozzarella

This recipe was delicious!!  We're trying to watch our red meat consumption so I experimented with reduced fat ground pork - turned out to be the best stuffed pepper I've ever had!!  Also instead of plain tomato sauce I used tomato sauce with Italian Seasoning.  I added fresh garlic and grated parmesean to the mix as well then sprinkled on top before serving.  We enjoyed this - it's going into our meal rotation!

This was fantastic! I've been switching ground beef for ground turnkey for a healthier kick and it turned out amazing! The Worcestershire added such a great kick...I never would have though of that! I also ended up cooking for a bit longer than 60 minutes, but the internal temp of turkey needs to be hotter. I will definitely be making this again! Fantastic recipe!

Oh man, these were delicious and so easy to make! My husband and I loved them - followed the recipe except doubled it for four peppers and added more tomato sauce (about 24oz).  It made just enough sauce for us.  We are definately keeping this one in our recipe cache!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My first time making stuffed peppers and they turned out to be fabulous! I didn't have any tomato sauce so I improvised and pureed a can of stewed chopped tomatoes and used a cup of that instead. It could have been a bit more tomato-y but in the end it was a delicious dinner and I will make this again for sure!

My husband and I tried this recipe for dinner tonite and we both loved it. He has never eaten stuffed peppers before tonite and he absolutely loved them. It was simple and basic. He didnt add the Worcestershire sauce but he did add garlic powder. We will be using this recipe again.

This was a great recipe.  It was for two of us, but we doubled it so we could have seconds.  The wife cooked this one, so I don't have any special tips (except that it's always nice to get the wife to do the cooking).  Highly recommended!

Yum, yum, yum! I used ground turkey instead of beef and I added a tsp of crushed garlic. I also doubled the rice. I followed someone else's suggestion and cut the peppers in half length wise. I put the meat in raw as the recipe says and by cutting the peppers in half they were perfectly cooked after only 35 min. I did blanch them as well before hand. By using Turkey there wasn't any extra grease as some others said there was with the beef. I found that I used a lot more sauce, cuz that's how I like it. They turned out great and I would definitely make these again!

This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers. This recipe was easy, and it turned out well. Instead of the tomato sauce, I mixed in salsa, which gave it a little more kick. My husband recommended tomato soup instead, which I suppose is a more traditional way to do it.

This recipe is a great base for a good dinner. Needs some flair, but that's where you can make it your own individual recipe. I like adding a couple tsps of minced garlic, some italian seasoning, and a lot of black pepper. Next time I think I'm gonna go with more veggies. Maybe I'll add corn or chopped up green beans to the mix. But anyways, this recipe is great.

This was my first attempt making stuffed peppers and the recipe was easy. I got great results. I used ground pork instead of beef. Also I used a Cajun flavored rice mixture instead of plain instant rice, which added a little extra flavor.

This is great. Perfect for single person who wants a home cooked meal without a lot of left overs. I used brown rice & ground turkey to make it healthier. Also used more tomato sauce that what the recipe calls for.

Thank you for a condensed recipe.  I used ground Turkey instead of beef and in the midst of mixing everything in a bowl I discovered I did not have any Worcestershire sauce, so I had to improvise....I added 1tbsp of Ms Dash hamburger seasoning and 1/2 tbsp of Ms Dash garlic and red pepper seasoning and just a bit more of the tomatoe sauce.  I added a roma tomatoe, diced and doubled the amount of onion, just because we love onion.  I did not blanche the peppers and that was a mistake!!!  They were not soft all the way through after cooking for 1 hour.  I recommend blanching before baking and using turkey to cut down on the grease that would be built up inside from beef.  Fantastic!!

These peppers were awesome!  I never tried a stuffed pepper that I liked until I made these for my husband.  I have 2 children under 2 years old, and I am always looking for something quick, and easy.  I tripled the recipe to make enough for 4 of us, and they turned out great.  A slight problem with the rice being undercooked (next time I will pre-cook it), but otherwise a wonderfu recipe.  Will definately use it again!

I loved these peppers. I used ground Italian sausage instead of beef. I also used 1/2 T Montreal Steak Seasoning and one clove minced garlic of the salt and pepper. I also forgot the blanching step by accident but the peppers turned out wonderful.

I made this recipe with 1 lb Bob Evans italian sausage instead of ground beef and doubled the instant rice (I had BIG green peppers! All of the mixture fit) to the meat mixture I added a tablespoon of minced garlic, 1/4 tsp of cumin, red onion, tomato soup instead of sauce, extra italian seasoning. I did not put cheese into the meat- figured it would be enough to have it on top.
To go with it, I cut up half of another green pepper into thin strips, a drained can of diced tomatoes, and more red onion, sauteed with a little garlic. 

I spead more instant rice around the pepper centered on the plate, and then the suateed peppers,onion, tomato mix over the rice. Oh! and I used a slice of Munster cheese on the top.

It turned out so well! I'm going to make it for my parents next time they come to visit:)

I am not a huge fan of stuffed peppers, but I thought I would give it a try. These were delicious! My boyfriend and I both loved them. I made a few changes though. I didn't blanch the peppers before cooking them, I also used some left over chicken I had instead of ground beef. I added a can of tomatoes and I cooked the rice ahead of time. For extra flavor, I used a little feta cheese in my pepper. Since I didn't have to wait for any meat or rice to cook in the oven, it only took about 30-40 minutes until the cheese started to melt and it was heated through.

I live in a small efficiency and all i have is a small convection oven, I'm always looking for small sized meals to bake, This was quick easy and just enough for dinner and lunch the next day. I added some fajita  seasoning to spice up the meat, and it turned out fantastic, i also skipped pre cooking the peppers and it turned out great, Thank you for this great recipe, I'll be making it often.

Loved it! :)

I put in about three times as much worcestershire sauce and twice as much onion as asked for, mainly because I like them both. 

I also omitted the cheese on top and instead made a cheese sauce (from a roux base) and put that on top instead. 

Husband loved it too - and it was the exact right amount for us both! Will definitely make it again.

It was my first time making stuffed peppers, and my husband and I loved them. The only thing I did ifferently from the recipe was use a spicy "Mexican style" tomato sauce. The added kick of spiciness was just right!

Excellent recipe!  Very filling!  It's a very nice side-dish that accompanies very well lemon-pepper chicken.

Flavor was delicious. The only problem was that it was very difficult to tell if the meat was cooked through, esp. because of the tomato sauce. We ended up having to microwave them. Next time, I will at least brown the meat.

This recipe was excellent, my husband and son loved them and requested that I make it more often. I did have to change one thing. I did not have a can of sauce so I used a can of whole peeled tomatoes and put them in a food processor. Thanks for the post!
