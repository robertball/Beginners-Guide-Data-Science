Used only 1/2 cup of Frank's hot sauce, sour cream mixed with ranch dip and topped with partial cooked bacon.  Oh my.

I scaled the recipe down but  other than that I made as written. These were delicious! I had one of the leftovers for lunch today and even though it wasn't quite as good as fresh out of the oven, it was still good. I will make one suggestion and that is to cut back on the cheese. Between all of the cheese and the buffalo sauce it was a little oily. The amount of sauce was spot on but there was just a little too much cheese in my opinion. Other than that, these were perfect!

I’ve made this about three times. My family loves it. I never change a recipe but I lowered the hot sauce to one cup. That’s just our personal preference.? this is definitely a keeper. It is delicious!?

These are good. The only change I made was to use some chicken breast that I already had cooked. I thought the amount of buffalo sauce might be too much but it was actually just right. I'm gong to try making these for my siblings next.

With large potatoes I found it took longer than started for the inside to be done. Otherwise we enjoyed the flavor and didn’t find the heat a problem. Honestly I may add more next time.

Warning - this was spicier than I thought it was going to be, and I didn't even use the full amount of hot sauce in the recipe.  I used Texas Pete and ran out, so I used a little over a cup.  However, we topped ours with blue cheese dressing and that cut the spice a lot.  We really liked it, but the spice was a little much for me to handle - that isn't really saying much though, I don't normally eat very spicy foods.

Great! But I only used 1/2 cup of hot sauce! Anymore would've been to much we think! Also the sour cream from another review was a great add on!

I used left over smoked pork roast for the meat. The smoke flavor really added to flavor.  No need to cook chicken special for this, just use any kind of left over roasted meat.

Loved this recipe! I used 8 small potatoes instead of 4 large because I wanted more of an appetizer. I buttered the outside of the potatoes before baking to keep them from drying out. I served with carrots and celery and homemade jalapeño ranch dressing. Absolutely yummy!
