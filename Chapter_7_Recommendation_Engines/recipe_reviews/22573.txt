I was a little uncertain about the ingredients at first but the soup turned out very tasty. I did add 2 beef boullion cubes for some additional flavor and also reduced the olive oil to 2 T. Next time I'd probably only use 1 T and about half the amount of water so there's not quite so much broth.

This soup is very good and easy to make! It tasts similar to traditional potato soup and the poached eggs add a nice touch! When I make this recipe it makes about 3 servings depending on what size potatos you use.

WOW! I can not say enough about this soup. It is easy low cost and is delicious. My kids call it breakfast soup. I used part chicken broth and part water since I had some leftover and a bit of diced ham. However I did make it again following the recipe and it is still amazing. Don't be afraid of the poached eggs. It is well worth it.

not spectacular but very good for how cheap it is. Was meet with acceptance by my family though I ended up chopping the potatos much much smaller than just 1/4s and added some poultry seasoning lemon pepper and beef boullion. Will probably do again because of the simplicity and ridiculous cheapness. second round added fennel seed and some milk; very yummy

I chuckled the first time I read the author's description that her father-in-law must have invented it because my mom made this very same soup! Wonder if they had shared ancestors from Sicily. Delicious easy soup that fills you up on a cold day. You can add ham or chicken if you want more protein. Especially good with fresh Italian bread.

We made something very similar in our Italian family with the exception of the eggs. We also added oregano. It was quick cheap and delicious.
