This recipe is inspirational!  I'm on a low fat/carb diet so I changed this one up a bit - i nixed the oil, used pam spray, made a fat free curry mustard mayo, spread it on a low carb tortilla, lined that with boston bib lettus and spooned some warm shrimp/pepper mixture and wrapped it up!  a FREAKING awsome lunch!  the flavours are out of this world!  thanks for this one!

This was okay.  Any recipe with bell peppers is terrible reheated.  The peppers turn to mush.  As a one night meal this is a three star.  As a reheat it is a one. The best way to eat this is making sure you have a piece of shrimp with a piece of pepper with a piece of basil on you fork.  Not bad, but we ALWAYS have leftovers and this doesn't work for that

I find A LOT of people OVERCOOK their food and cook it at too high of a tempurature, this would lead to the mushy peppers, rice, ect.   Still love this dish!

Like most others, I tweaked a bit. It needed more oil to stir-fry and I used less of the basil than called for. Wish I'd had a red pepper as the photos would have been more colorful but since I cut the recipe in half, I used one yellow pepper with some green on it. We liked this and will make it again during the summer months when most of the vegetable and herb ingredients are fresh from our garden. Note: I used the raw shells from the shrimp to flavor the pasta water - remove before adding the pasta. Kicks up the flavor!

Served this with rice and it was excellent.  Used dried basil instead and doubled the sauce. We added the cooked rice at the end and mix it all together, the rice tasted excellent with the seasoning.  Will make again soon.

Nice for a change.  I like my shrimp with the shells so I left them... but i think it would have been more enjoyable to eat if I took the time.  I'm not usually a big fan of red peppers but the combination with the basil made a nice fragrant dish.  Might be a bit spicy for some but I liked it.

A simple tasty dish.  I made it and served it over noodles.  It was very simple and light.  Nothing spectacular but a good little meal.  I'd make this again and make some changes.  It's a good base to a recipe.

Made this with half of a pound of shrimp and half pound of scallops. Used maybe 1/4 tea pepper flakes, which was plenty for my taste. I also added celery and onion and served it all over rice.
