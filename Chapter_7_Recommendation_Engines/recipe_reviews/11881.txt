I thought this was a very good simple pasta salad recipe.  Just to spice it up a bit, I added chopped parsley and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Otherwise, you can pretty much add WHATEVER you want and it will still taste good!

This recipe sounded delicious, but I think the proportions might be off.  I added more dijon mustard for more tanginess, but the end result was a lot blander than I expected.  I think this recipe might need some fine tuning, but has some potential to be delicious.  One thing I thought sounded good was to maybe add something sweet, like honey, to the dijon mustard.

Very tasty!  I doubled the amount of dijon & pasta and used 3 large plum tomatoes.  There might be something still missing from this recipe, but it won't stop me from making this again.

Really easy to make.  Different from your usual pasta salads.  I've made it several times now and it just gets better!

Made this last night and the hubby devoured it. I thought it could use a little more kick, so next time I may
up the dijon a little and maybe the
Chile pepper. But we will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE THIS! Added chopped red bell pepper - it was a great addition to add some crispness.  Used serrano peppers - a bit spicier than your average pepper. I also added a tbsp of sweet honey mustard because it looked good - and it was!!!! Doubled the recipe, and husband devoured in a day.

We really liked this recipe, for two reasons. First my Husband can make it and it is a fast recipe.
I changed the yogurt to no fat Lemon yogurt. 1 6oz. cotainer and 1/2 tea. more dijon. Yummy. We make 4 servings. I have what is left(if lucky) for lunch the next day.

This pasta salad is ok - it is missing something, but I have not figured out what.  I like all the ingredients that are in it, but it needs something else.  Hoping that once it sits overnight the flavors will meld a little better.

This was an odd combinations of flavors for me.  I think it had too much dijon.  I used a serrano pepper and it was plenty spicy!  Due to the tomato recall I ended up using a package of grape tomatoes.

This was a great dressing, but I do scrape the seeds of the pepper first.  Only thing missing were the crunches (chopped colored peppers, onion, celery, raw baby zucchini, chopped broc. florets & shredded carrots.)  Also increased yogurt to 6 oz. container.  For a full meal add shredded chicken, pork, beef or chick peas.  I know - complete change but we love our crunches * don't change the dressing ingredients. Thanks.

Love the picture with gemilli pasta, my favorite.  Can't get the Barilla brand around here, so have to make do with second best.  Gemilli has just the right "mouth-feel" for pasta salads.

It called for WAY too much mustard. It was so strong that I couldn't taste ANYTHING else; completely overbearing. Plus, like some others said, the overall dish really is just lacking something. I can not put my finger on it, but it was just too...bland. Won't be making it again.

The flavors just didn't blend well and O felt like something was missing. Won't make this again.
