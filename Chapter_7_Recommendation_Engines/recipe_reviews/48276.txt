I love screwdrivers, and the grey goose is excellent vodka!  A little pricy, but well worth it!  I had a party recently and ran out of OJ, so we used up some Sunny Delight I had left, and that is fantastic!  That is how i make them now!

My wonderful boyfriend spoiled me by bringing me home a bottle of Grey Goose (At almost $50 a pop. Wow!!!) I can't drink the "cheap stuff" anymore *LoL* Anyway, LOVE screwdrivers. Only diff, I like Orange Juice with lots of pulp, so I used that instead.

Personally, I think any good, top shelf vodka is great. However, I am not a fan of grey goose and I definitely don't think you should use it in a mixed drink cocktail.  My personal favorite screwdriver vokdas are Chopin and Stoli. Stoli Orange with OJ is just perfect.

I agree that freshly-squeezed orange juice is the best, especially if you get interesting oranges, such as blood oranges. If you get a juicer it doesn't take that long to make fresh orange juice for a special cocktail, and then you can strain out all the pulp if you like.

Try adding 7up, sprite or similar pops to give it a twist & some fizz. Plus it will douse the heart burn later

Made the mistake of using orange juice with a lot of pulp  (that was all I had on hand)  I unfortunately do not like pulp, so I then tried without pulp.  Much better.  Thanks

I have to agree with another reviewer, fresh squeezed OJ is the absolute best for making this drink.

It really doesn't matter what kind of vodka you use.  For all my vodka cocktails I use Fleishman's which sells for $6.99 a litre bottle where I live.  The orange juice, however, is what truly makes the BIG difference like Jane says.  Most definitely use real premium oj, not concentrate and you will taste the difference immediately.  I always have bought premium and the one time I got a free bottle of concentrate from the store, my sons refused to drink it since they have been brought up on the real stuff.  I drank more than my share of these delicious cocktails last night and definitely knocked my socks off!

I'm not a connoisseur of vodka so I used what I had with fresh squeezed orange juice. Very tasty, thanks for sharing.

This was made for the Allstar Challenge.

Use hammer and sickle or any over seas vodka and put in a blender with 2 oz of triple sec. Grey goose is over rated. Half The price you can get Russian vodka that is 10 times smoother and better tasting.

This is my favorite way to drink vodka.  I had one very juicy orange which was enough for one drink, which I must say is WAY better than the bottled stuff..so good!
