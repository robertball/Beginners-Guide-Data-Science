Excellent recipe
I try it with and without the zucchini
Its best without them
I double the amount of cream cheese instead.

I made this for my husband's birthday.  I left the zucchini out as well and doubled the cream cheese.  It was good, I thought it was a little dry though.  4 stars because my husband loved it and it was his birthday cake!!

eh not so great.  The cream cheese layer mixed with the top chocolate layer.  The chocolate layer was a little dry.  If you are looking for a zucchini chocolate recipe the zucchini brownies on this site are much better.
