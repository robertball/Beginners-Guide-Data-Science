Instead of using the artichoke marinade.  Use 6 tbsp olive oil, 
5 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoon dried oregano

I gave this 5 stars...after I made some changes.  I added about 1/2 c. of a good italian dressing and about 1/4 c. of red wine vinegar to spice it up a little.  Now it is AMAZING.  Everyone loved it!!  I made the orzo and mixed it with the dressing, vinegar, lemon and spices the day before and then added the veggies the morning of.  Very good and very pretty!

This is a great summer salad, absolutely delicious!  My husband commented about how quickly I scarfed it down.  I made some changes: basil instead of oregano, black pepper instead of lemon pepper, an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, an extra large tomato, only half an onion, and some balsamic vinegar to taste.  Next time I make it I'll probably keep those changes except that I'll use even less onion and even more tomato.  I think this recipe would be great without changes, too.  It claims to make 6 servings, but those servings must be awfully big, because this makes a lot.  I think I'd call it 8-10 servings.

This is my #2 all time fave from this site, second only to the Brown Sugar Meatloaf. As are many others, I am guilty to modifications based on what I have in the house, as well as taste preferences.  I am into easy prep and finding shortcuts, so I used an English cucumber and didn't remove the seeds, and the tomatos were those cute baby grape tomatoes, cut in half (used approx 20); no seed removal there also.  Thanks to the advice of other reviewers here, I purchased bottled Greek dressing, and tossed in 1/2 cup. On the first try I only used 1/4 red onion, but I will upgrade that next time to 1/2.  I would also double the lemon pepper, and add more salt (I use sea salt) and a liberal dose of freshly ground black pepper.  Definitely more lemon... I will juice a full lemon next time...lemon is a leading flavor in authentic Greek cuisine, and 1 T is WAY too short.  Also tossed in some sliced Greek pepperoncini (found in the condiment aisle near the olives), approx 1/4 cup.  This is FABULOUS, and gets even better overnight.  It is also very pretty and colorful when served in a glass bowl.  Again, a keeper. Husband, kids, and picky grandkids ALL loved it.  Thanks to the original submitter of this recipe.  LoveLoveLove this!!!!!!

I made it exactly as the recipe said, except maybe just a little bit less red onion.  I didn't do as the other responders did and add balsamic vinegar or anything. I wanted to try it as posted first.  I don't think I'll ever change it.  This is a very fresh, light, yummy and beautiful salad!

I made this recipe with some changes. I added garbanzo beans and green onions and chopped up the artichokes. Also, instead of using the drained marinade, I added some KRAFT Greek Vinaigrette Dressing that was in the fridge. This turned out really good! I wasn't sure if my son liked artichokes or not, that's why I cut them up. My boyfriend and I love them so I couldn't omit them...the boy would have to suffer! Turns out, everyone loved the salad...and, the kid likes artichokes! My son's girlfriend was over the day after and had some and she loved it, too. I also used gemelli pasta instead of the orzo...it was awesome!!  Thanks!   Erin

Made this recipe today exactly as instructed.  I was pretty disappointed.  The concept was good, but I found it extremely dry and tasteless.  I see that other people changed the recipe.  I believe you should make it the way stated first, then rate it.  If you rate it a 5 and make tons of changes that is not a true rating.  That is one of my pet peeves about this site.  I will make it again but will definitely use a bottled dressing or ingredients that will make a good dressing.

Amazing. I took it to a party and the entire bowl was gone in 5 minutes. It was best on Day 3, so it is a really great dish if you want to make something ahead of time. Next time, I will use the whole package of orzo with the same quantities of the other ingredients to make a bigger batch. Thank you!

I LOVE this salad!!!  I am guilty of making a bit of changes though, based on my tastes.  I omitted the cherry tomatoes and the red onion, and instead used 6 sundried tomatoes.  I placed the sundried tomatoes and the black olives and the artichokes in the cuisinart and chopped all of it, then mixed it with the pasta.  Instead of the marinade, I used Greek dressing like other reviewers.  I also used dried parsley flakes (2 tbsp).  This is an amazing salad.  I'm going to have more!

Yummy yummy!  The BF and I gobbled it up!
I am giving it 4 stars b/c I changed some of it.  I used reduced fat feta, cut back the orzo and increased the veggies to make it a little healthier.  Used the non-marinated artichokes and subbed 1/2c balsamic vinegrette dressing.  Also subbed kalamata olives for true Greek flavor.  Didn't used the parsley b/c I didn't have any.  Will definately use it next time.

Excellent!  I used seedless English cucumbers and halved cherry tomatoes to cut down on prep.  I also used Kraft Greek Vinagrette Dressing instead of the artichoke marinade and block feta as previously suggested.  In the future, I'd even add grilled chicken to make it a meal!

This was a great recipe. I too made a few adjustments. Like one of the other reviews I replaced the artichokes (marinate and hearts) with 6 tbsp olive oil, 4 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoon dried oregano. I used pepper instead of lemon pepper and Kalamata olives instead of black olives. I mixed the orzo with the marinate I made and let it sit overnight then added the other ingredients the next morning and let it refrigerate an hour longer. I added the tomatoes and feta right before I served it so it didn't over power the dish or make it soggy.

This is a good salad, great ingredients, but I was expecting more flavor. I didn't think the artichoke marinade gave enough flavor, so I added more lemon juice, more lemon pepper, drizzled on some olive oil and sprinkled on some white wine vinegar. I also added some chopped baby spinach for extra nutrition. Took some doctoring, but we loved the result!

So many interesting and compatible ingredients!  This was really delicious.  I used Kalamata olives rather than ripe black olives and found I had to add a little more seasoning to make all these wonderful flavors come alive.  I also added a good drizzle of olive oil.  I served this at room temperature.  Excellent.

I've been playing around with orzo salad recipes for a while now, and I've found my "go to" recipe. I actually diverged from this one in many ways, but that's why I give it five stars--it's incredibly forgiving and adjustable to taste. For my part, I boil the orzo in low-sodium vegetable broth for added flavor, used fresh basil instead of parsley, crumbled chevre instead of feta, omitted the olives (didn't have them--kalamata would have been nice!), and found that no extra oil from the artichoke marinade or extra dressing was needed, though I was very liberal with the lemon juice and I did add a touch of salt. My key point--especially using chevre--is that I don't add the cheese until after it chills, since I prefer it to remain an individual ingredient rather than melt into a creamy sauce in the hot pasta. Of course, it's all a matter of taste!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We did add 6 tbsp olive oil, 5 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoon dried oregano instead of the artichoke marinade like someone else suggested.  Makes great leftovers!

THIS IS A NICE LIGHT REFRESHING SALAD. VERY DELICIOUS. I USED KALAMATA OLIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE SALTY AND I DID NOT HAVE TO ADD EXTRA SALT. I ALSO ADDED HEARTS OF PALM IN PLACE OF ONE OF THE MARINATED ARTICHOKE HEARTS AND ADDED THEN A FEW DRIZZLES OF OLIVE OIL.
THANK YOU FOR SUBMITTING. THE PASTA FINALLY DID NOT OVERWHELM THE SALAD. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO TAME THE ONION A BIT SLICE AND PUT IN ICE COLD WATER FOR ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES THE CHOP/DICE. YUM

A good foundation recipe but with a few changes, you can make it 5 stars. Definitely needs more dressing. The orzo absorbs a lot of it, so you need to adjust it a couple of times. It is better after a couple of days. Don't be shy with adding more ingredients such as more feta, sun-dried tomatoes, or different marinated veggies. I served this with chicken and tzatziki. Great dinner side dish!

This was very tasty, colorful and pleasing to the palate.  It was even better several hours later as the ingredients melded together and had some time to chill.  One small change I made the second time I made this, only because I love the taste of lemon so much, I grated lemon rind into the pasta.

This salad is delicious! I made it exactly as instructed the first couple of times and it really is great, but I now like to make a few changes. I add an extra tomato and cut down on the onion. I would also recommend using kalamata olives (soooo yummy!) If I'm in a hurry I just use the artichoke marinade, but it's spectacular if you use homemade Greek dressing (I use a recipe from this site) It keeps well, in fact I think it tastes better the next day, so it's great for potlucks or lunches! It's quick to throw together and so good, I make it all the time now :)

My daughter and I loved this one!  The orzo just makes this something really unique.  Instead of the dressing that the recipe calls for, I used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site.  I'll be doing this one again soon.

Really good! This salad is not only delicious, but really pretty too. I love the clean, fresh flavors from the herbs and lemon juice. Of course, I didn't read the directions through and threw away the artichoke marinade, so I added a drizzle of olive oil for some moisture. Very good, thank you!

Made recipe as written, except I forgot to buy a tomato, so I substituted canned diced tomatoes. I also used about 2/3 of the onion because it was a very strong onion. This is definitely better after it has had time to chill. I would recommend adding the feta just before serving, as the flavor doesn't stand out much otherwise.

Excellent! I love Greek food with feta cheese and I loved this one. I also added Greek salad dressing instead of marinade and used cherry tomatoes. Made it for Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it! Is a keeper!!

Pretty much followed the recipe and it was delicious - exactly what I was looking for!  I made a few tweaks though.  I knew I wanted more taste so I used kalamata  olives instead of black olives.  I don't like oregano so I omitted that.  I also used grape tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes.  I have to wonder if those who thought there wasn't enough flavor used canned artichokes instead of marinated.  I thought this recipe was amazing and plan to make it again!

I made this recipe with two changes. First I completely omitted the red onion, which I don't care for. If I want an onion flavor, I add chopped scallions to taste. Second, I only used about 1/3 of the artichoke marinade as dressing; more would just have puddled at the bottom of the bowl. I used the glass jars of marinated artichokes and these may have more marinade.

Made this for a large crowd and got some rave reviews. It was so good. Made it just the the way the recipe shows. It actually gets better the longer the flavors have time to soak in. Will definitely make it again!

This simple dish is so delicious and versatile. If you're up to trying something new, try what I did. I use Kalamata olives, herbed feta cheese, I used the time saving pre-cooked chicken breasts (Perdue) and added cinnamon and allspice, as well as 2 cloves of fresh garlic. I left out the fresh onion only because I'm not a fan. The fresh garlic, chicken, Kalamatas and cinnamon & allspice come together nicely for a "Moroccan" type dish that could actually be a main dish with the lean protein added. This also works really well with couscous, and is great eaten hot or chilled, it's hard to mess this up :)

AWESOME RECIPE! I had never had orzo before so this recipe was a new one for me, but I loved it! I made the recipe as given, but made sure to mix the feta with the orzo first while the orzo was warm, melting the feta.  I also didn't use the marinade before serving but instead used some greek salad dressing. The amount this made was huge! Next  time I will 1/2 of 1/4 this recipe. Yes, I will be making this again.

Super yummy summer salad. The feta is perfect in this salad. I don't like marinated artichokes so I drained and discarded the water they were packed in and used a oil/vinegar dressing so the pasta wasn't dry. Thanks for sharing!!!

Very, very good.  I used canned artichokes so instead of using the marinade from the jar for the last step, subbed Marie's Greek Vinaigrette.

I made this for my monthly Pampered Chef meeting and was so glad I did.  Everyone loved it and we may even use it to demo products for cooking shows!  I took other reviews and made the Absolutely Fabulous Greek House dressing on this sight.  Super easy!  Thanks and I will definitely be making this again!

Great combination!  I left out the artichoke hearts, so instead of using the juice for the dressing, I made the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" from this site.  It really made the salad!!

This is a wonderful salad! It was a great side for the Grecian Pork Tenderloin also on this site.  I found that it made a lot, but the leftovers were even better than the salad the first day.  I think next time I’ll make it a day ahead or at least the morning before I serve it.  Also, I didn’t use the artichoke marinade & used the dressing suggested by Dining Diva.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a very light  and refreshing summer dish. I listened to some of the reviewers and made minor changes.  Instead if using the artichoke marinade I used Good Seasons italian dressing. I substituted calmata olives in place of the black olives and omitted the salt because the olives are salty enough.

I was so proud of myself for making this because it was such a hit at every pot luck I brought this to! I followed the suggestion of skipping the artichoke brine (don't care for the salt in it) and just used a bit of olive oil, lemon and a tiny splash of balsamic vinegar - however, I honestly believe that you could do without any dressing at all, the ingredients themselves are already so flavourful! A lot of chopping, but so worth it!

Delicious!  Instead of orzo, I used a smaller pasta and it tasted great.  Can't wait to make it again using the preferred pasta.  My husband who does not like artichokes, loved it, so I know it's a keeper recipe.

Pretty good in my opinion. Beware this is deceiving and made a big bowl. Had tons left after dinner. Followed recipe except no olives per my personal preference. I felt it needed a little more liquid/dressing prior to placing in fridge to chill so I added a bit if the marinade early (the rest of which I added later, per recipe). Family said it was good, but for me I wanted a bit more seasoning. Feta taste was prominent which is ok. I didn't tweek much as it was first time making, and wanted to follow recipe as much as I could.  Next time may play with seasonings or add my own Greek dressing.

I would have rated a 5, but I made mods based on other reviews.  I used about 3/4 cup of greek dressing instead artichoke marinade.  In fact, I didn't use artichokes at all only because we don't like them.  I also added a bit of corn.  What's easy about this is it's versatility.  You can add and subtract to your liking.  My family loved this, but made mods to suit our tastes.  Thank you!

This is excellent!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter.  The only change I made was to add the juice of one whole lemon.  It makes a LOT.  This is more like 10 servings (at least) not six.  But it's yummy and I am sure would be a popular hit at anyone's cookout.  YUM!

I think I made this almost exactly as the recipe stated, except I did take one reviewer's advice and bought the cucumbers that don't need to be seeded.  I also forgot to buy fresh parsley so I used dried.  I took another reviewer's advice and made this the night before.  I knew that pretty much no one else in my family would eat this, but I was dying to try it...so I made a full batch two nights ago, and took it to work with me for lunch the rest of this week.  They were right, the longer it sits, the better it tastes, and if you are going to store it or make it ahead, definitely save the marinade til right before you eat it...I had two bowls of leftovers and in one, I poured half the marinade.  By morning, it was gone, soaked up by the pasta I guess.  Adding it right before serving keeps it moist and also keeps the pasta from clumping, plus the artichoke marinade was nice and light, and had a really great, mild flavor.

If you're serving/eating this like a meal (it makes a GREAT light lunch, and is VERY balanced) then the six servings is about right, but if you're using it for a side, I'd say 10-12 servings is more like it.

Loved this!

Made this for a BBQ/birthday party and thought it was pretty good but not my favorite.  I think the red onions are a little strong for my taste.  I don't do canned olives but used kalamata and rotini instead of orzo.  Because I think I added extra pasta, I did add more of the juice from the marinated artichokes (we buy the big Costco jars so I had plenty) but it was still a tad dry.

Great salad!  I added a little dill and used regular pepper instead of lemon pepper and amped up the lemon juice instead.  I also didn't have parsley so the dill added a nice touch of green.

Everyone liked it and I will definitely serve it again!

Great recipe.  I also had to add a little more lemon and a little of red wine vinegar.  I also added banana peppers, which gave it this zing. :)

A nice variation for a pasta salad and so easy to make. This is always a hit. Whenever I serve it am always asked for the recipe. I did make a few changes- I don't really like cucumbers so omitted them, used grape tomatoes as another reviewer suggested- so easy. Also used Greek Kalamata olives instead of black olives. Can't go wrong with this salad

Made this last night using the advice of others - love it! I used about a cup of light Greek dressing in place of the artichoke marinade, and I omitted the red onion. It's definitely the type of recipe you can tweak and make to your own tastes and preferences. Marinating overnight was key though, as it allowed the flavors to really seep in. Brought to a work potluck today, and it was soooooo good. Definitely recommend it.

Great recipe for Pot Luck.  I felt the dressing needed to be kicked up a notch, so I added some Balsamic Vineager and that was just what it needed.

I loved this BEFORE I added the reserved artichoke juice. The whole salad tasted like marinated artichokes after the juice was added. Next time I'll just add more lemon juice and a little olive oil.

This salad was so easy and good. I did substitute sundried tomatoes packed in herb oil then used the oil from them instead of the artichoke oil.  It was wonderful!  My guest raved and took home the recipe!

This is my favorite new recipe.  When cutting up the artichoke hearts I always remove any 'hard' outer leaves that are chewy.  I also add to taste finely shredded mozarella cheese.  My nephew who's in college wanted this recipe 2 take back with him he loved it so much!  Now this will be my staple when making a salad for a party - I don't use the lemon pepper or dried oregano.  I add more fresh lemon juice and the artichoke marinade for the dressing with salt and pepper.

Awesome dish!  I added 3 cut up, pre-cooked Italian-seasoned chicken breasts to make it a meal.  I couldn't find orzo pasta at my store, so I used 2 boxes of "Near East" brand of rice pilaf, which has both orzo pasta and rice in it.  Loved it!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" on this site, scaled down to 5 servings (and it *was* absolutely fabulous!).  Because I used a dressing, I bought UNmarinated artichoke hearts, but did throw in the 1/4 cup parsley and 1 Tbl. lemon juice (which is what helps make this dish taste Greek!).  I used whole kalamata Greek olives instead of canned plain ones, 2 (large) tomatoes instead of just 1, and omitted the onion (all just a personal preference).  Serve with pita wedges.  What a fantastic salad!  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh. My. I was a little weary because I was making it for my greek boyfriend (who is a chef haha) and we absolutely loved it. I rated it 4 out of 5 because I omitted the artichoke hearts (we had them the night before) and used a dressing from the site called "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" and let me tell you what! It is probably going to be a staple at my house now! It's even better the day after! ;)

I made this for a family cook-out and it was a hit!  I made a couple of alterations.  I used cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and I also used the 'Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing' recipe instead of the artichoke marinade.  I will continue to make this again & again!

Delicious!  Be sure to use Kalamata olives for a real Greek flavor.  The recipe is wonderful "as is," but I like to double the amount of tomato and cucumber and I just use half a red onion.  I've tried it with a bit of commercial Greek Salad Dressing and that is very tasty, too.  My family loves this.

Very delicious side for a BBQ I just had.  I used the tri-color orzo which gave such a wonderful added flavor and I left out the olives for taste preference.  I used red, orange, and green peppers to add more color.  I made the night before the party and just before serving I skipped adding in the artichoke marinade and added instead a greek vinagrette dressing with a splash of balsamic.  Very good and the little that was left over still tasted good a few days later.
Will make again.

I had high hopes for this salad, but it just wasn't for me.  The pasta soaked up most of the dressing, so it was kind of dry and bland.  Probably won't make again.

I made this recipe as written.  I did have additional dressing on hand as recommended by other reviewers. It is a big winner in our house.  There was no need to add the back up dressing.  Only thing I can think that might have been different than others who thought it needed more was the brand of marinated artichoke hearts?  Since that seems to be the dominant flavoring.

This was so delcious I couldnt stop eating it!  It definitely tastes better the next day so let it sit overnight (leaving the feta cheese out until serving that is).
I used 6 tablespoons of olive oil and 5 table spoons of red wine vinegar with the lemon and seasonings(instead of artichoke marinade).  Then i tossed the pasta only with the dressing and let that sit for a few hours in the fridge.  Later i added the rest of the veggies, etc, and we ate some.  I felt it needed a bit more sauce, so i added a little bit of italian dressing.  We added the cheese to our individual servings as needed, instead of to the entire batch.  It was good, but then next morning it was FABULOUS!!!!  Give this a try....its got soooo many possibilities :)   
As for the folks that get upset about changing a recipe and rating it...I always read several reviews as well as the recipe to gauge what I would like and what I might change....but then, I never do exactly as a recipe states anyways :)  Always read the reviews!  :)

Bland. I followed the recipe. It sounded good, and I like all the components, but it needs a more flavorful dressing than the marinade from the artichokes. Maybe a bit of balsamic glaze would wake it up. Definitely would not make this again without some changes.

I really, really love this salad! I can taste all of the ingredients in one spoonful. It is so tasty-on the 1st day.  After that, it seems a little bland.  I made it up on Sunday (as written) to take to work for lunches during the week.  Even though it has feta cheese in it, the dish still needs a little "something" to give it a boost.  I had to add a little salt to perk it up.  I will still make this dish, but now I know it needs improvement on the second day.

Excellent recipe.  I made it according to the recipe but then added a bit of olive oil and a bit more lemon juice after tasting it. That really improved the taste further.  

I also added chicken that I had sautéed in chicken broth, white wine and lemon juice to give the dish some extra protein.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried from this site.  Thank you for it.

I liked this, however, I didn't pay attention to the directions when it came to saving the artichoke marinade. I had already dumped it out, so oops on my part. My feta was no longer good, so I couldn't use that, but otherwise I made as written.

Just okay as written - the dressing needs some work. I ended up mixing up a different greek dressing recipe and added that instead. For a basic dressing, try equal parts olive oil and red wine vinegar, then add salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, mustard powder, and lemon juice to taste. With that addition it made for a tasty lunch. I might try adding a can of tuna to the leftovers for some variety the next time I eat it.

What a delicious side dish/salad!  Was looking for something to go with our 4th of July menu.  I made the Marinated Greek Chicken Kabobs (from this site) and this salad was the perfect accompaniment. I served it warm instead of cold.  Next time I might add more lemon juice for even more tang but it's great as-is.  The marinade from the artichoke hearts gave great flavor, too. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Patrice!

Great summer recipe!  I used sliced olives and will use halved grape or cherry tomatoes next time.  The artichoke juice is definitely necessary to keep the salad moist.

I was very happy with this! It was extremely easy being that I now keep gallon zip-lock bags of orzo gently tossed with olive oil in the freezer (thanks Belle!). I used kalamata olives and as many suggested and I did use a greek dressing instead of the artichoke marinade. I thought the lemon pepper added a nice touch. Thank you! This will be in my salad rotation this summer!

This salad is really good. I modified it quite a bit, based on the ingredients I had, but it turned out great. I used cucumber, sun-dried tomatoes in oil, grated cheddar, red onion and black olives. Since I didn't have artichokes, I used 1/2 cup of Farm Boy Greek Dressing and added salt and pepper. Delicious!

Just made this tonight for tomorrow's family brunch... excellent recipe! My only mods were to lessen the amount of feta and artichoke hearts (though I didn't need to in hindsight) and to add a small amount of red wine vinaigrette, Italian dressing, salt, and sugar (plus a little cold water to keep the orzo from gluing together while chopping and adding ingredients).

This is my new favorite pasta salad!  So good!  I followed the recipe to a t except that I used half a red onion.  This makes a ton so if you didn't have a big group I would definately half the recipe.  So delicious and very pretty, great summer side dish.

Absolutely loved this and it's so pretty in the bowl. I did go a little lighter on the feta purely because the dish it accompanied also had feta in it. I'd definitely use the full amount otherwise. There were fights over who got the leftovers for their lunch the next day. Thanks so much for sharing Patrice.

Yum! I halved the orzo and kept the veggies and cheese amounts the same. I didn't have marinated artichokes, so I used about 4 tbsp olive oil, 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1.5 tsp lemon juice and 2 tsp dried oregano. The lemon juice and oregano amounts are in place of the amounts called for in the recipe. I didn't wait until serving to toss them in - just mixed everything at once before letting sit in the fridge. Very good!

yum yum yum! The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the olives and put in some garbanzo beans instead (trying to make it bit more filling).  This has a really nice flavor to it and I think it would go well with lots of dishes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I went the lazy route and used Kraft Greek Vinigrette.  Did not use the artichoke or marinade either.  I really enjoyed it and had it for several days leftover.  Great summer salad and for a party:)

Absolutely great! As another reviewer suggested, I did not use the spices/marinade here, but used the Abolutely Fabulous GreekHouse Dressing from this site. I could not stop eating it. I did not have artichoke hearts, so added sliced green olives instead. Yum.

Amazing. I made it for my coworkers and everyone loved it. I used yellow and red tomatoes marinaded in olive oil, basil and parm cheese overnight then diced them the next day. I also used artichoke hearts in just water, omitted the parsley and put in fresh basil. I drizzled just the smallest amount of the absolutely fabulous greek dressing from this site but it really didnt need a lot. a tablespoon or two is enough. I didnt use any oregano or lemon pepper either. It is plenty flavorful. Really tasty!

this recipe is delicious.  I did change it quite a bit to suite my tastes.  I used a box of bowtie pasta.  I  made a dressing of redwine vinegar, olive oil, fresh oregeno, fresh thyme, lemon juice, finely chopped garlic, salt, and pepper.  I also used greek kalmata olives and roasted red peppers.  It was probably one of the best pasta salads I have ever had.

Delicious side dish, thank you so much for sharing it with us. I added more cucumber and tomatoes in order to emphasize the salad quality, and I used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing from this site. You can hold the olives and feta cheese until just before serving if you don't want the feta to dissolve in the dressing too much. Orzo is a wonderful pasta for salads because its compact shape seems to keep it from tearing or disintegrating.

Great recipe, huge hit with my family!  This made a lot, but no leftovers!!  I made some changes.  I used a can of un-marinated artichoke hearts, and omitted the lemon juice.  For the dressing, I used Kraft Greek dressing.  I used about 1/3 of the bottle.    Very refreshing and went well with the Greek Chicken recipe from this site.

Wow! Fresh and zesty!  This salad has a delightful combination of textures and flavors. It has been a huge hit at every bbq I've taken it to.  What I love the most is that it's just a little different from your average pasta salad...and NO MAYO!

Great Recipe! I used bottle Greek salad dressing and also added chopped green pepper.  I usually make Italian pasta salad so this was a refreshing and delicious change of pace.  Will definitely use for upcoming potlucks this summer!

Excellent!!  I have made it twice in two weeks, once for my own enjoyment and once for a work BBQ - it was an absolute hit.  The ingredients are on my shopping list again this week.  The only thing I did was sub red pepper for tomatoes and greek olives for black.

I did what others suggested and used bottled dressing instead.  It was delicious.  I really enjoyed the orzo as opposed to regular pasta and found it refreshing compared to most pasta salads filled with cheese and meat.

Absolutely delicious!  I only had artichoke hearts in water, so I made a little dressing similar to Diva's, with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  I might add some shrimp to this next time.

I enjoyed this meal a lot.  I substituted the artichokes with some leftover chicken that was simply marinated in balsamic vinegar.  And my feta was looking kind of old sitting the back of the fridge so I used parmesean cheese.  Other than that, I kept with the recipe.

I made this tonight and it was so good! I added cooked chicken, left out the artichoke juice and for spices only used salt, pepper, parsley and oregano. Yummy yummy. I will make this again! It would be good (maybe w/o the orzo) wrapped up in a tortilla.

My family loved this! The only modification we did was to use elbow macaroni instead of orzo. The flavors were delicious and it was very light and refreshing. The artichokes are a MUST- they are what really make this special. Great!

This was so good.  I made my own changes, mostly to the dressing.  I added lemon juice, fresh basil, and red wine vinegar.  Fresh garlic would be nie too.  I enjoyed this at room temperature.

I've made this so many times with different variations. I use whatever veggies I have on hand, such as tomato, broccoli, cucumber, zucchini, asparagus, but I feel red onion and artichoke have to always be used. I usually add garlic powder and sometimes use white pepper instead of lemon pepper, cilantro or mint instead of parsley, sometimes I add a bit of olive oil to make it a little smoother. But this recipe can be easily modified to suit anyone's pickiness! Delicious!

Excellent.  Everyone loved it and was so colorful.  I put it in a clear bowl.  I too used that dressing, but don't put too much or it will take away for it is very tangy. Making it again for more beach company.

This is wonderful! I served it for dinner with guests   the first time I made it and just hoped it would come out good ... they liked it so much they wanted the recipe and I'll be making it again very soon for my family. I didn't have lemon juice or enough cucumber and only stuck it in the freezer for 15 minutes (I was in a time crunch :) but it still turned out great. I found out later they only asked for the recipe because she didn't believe I made it! Insulting, but whatever. We never had them over again :) !

I added grilled chicken and used half Italian dressing and half artichoke marinade. I think next time I'll use all Italian dressing. I didn't have lemon pepper and I think it would have tasted better if I'd added it.

I made this recipe and DH said it was pale so we added a can of black beans for colour.  Aside from that it is an amazing salad (he said he would never eat orzo but he loved it!)

The only tough thing about this was the prep work- cutting veggies and cooking pasta a d waiting for it to cool-  other than that it's healthy and fresh tasting.  I added chick peas to it for more protein and changed the oregano to fresh dill

I make Orzo pasta very often. The recipe here is not very exciting. I always add Salmon (either poached or grilled). Also, adding sun dried tomato is a must for me. You can also grill vegetable (egg plant is always good), rather than putting them raw

Delicious. I preferred it served warm. Would also be great with kalmata olives. I also skipped the seasoning, preferring some cracked black pepper as there was more than enough flavour with the artichoke marinade.

As written I would give this a 4. I added a can of non-marinated artichoke hearts, along with the marinate artichoke hearts, doubled the lemon and used kalamata olives. If I would have stopped here, it would have been fine but the hubs suggested adding a little pepperoni and salami. After that addition, it was a hit. I still thought it was just okay but everyone at the party had seconds and thirds. I will be making it again but I will use rotini instead of orzo. Just personal preference on the pasta.

This is a keeper!  I would just change up the dressing to meet your taste buds. I went a little light on the artichoke hearts because they are not my favorite.

Used a little bit of artichoke marinade, plus olive oil, more lemon juice, and some red wine for the dressing.  Very nice, not oily, and my partner who's not a huge fan of artichokes liked it.

This recipe makes enough to feed an army.  It's good, but not great.  It came out very dry, so I had to add quite a bit more red wine vinegar and olive oil just to lubricate the stuff and give it some kick.

This was very good! My hubby wasn't thrilled, but he doesn't like artichokes or cukes!

I used the artichoke marinade but also used dining diva's suggestion of red wine, olive oil and oregano. It added just the extra oomph needed! I also added more salt, personal taste.

I served it with sautéed chicken breasts seasoned with lemon pepper seasoning.

I tried this two times because the first time I made a change that definitely did not work.  I did not have feta cheese, so I tried a much softer goat cheese and at first it was delicious.  However, within an hour the soft cheese had taken over and nothing else could be tasted except the cheese.  The second time I made certain I had feta and it will now be a favorite of our family.  It is a perfect dish for any time of year, but I especially enjoy it in hot weather.

Very good!! I only used a half medium red onion and omitted the lemon juice and lemon pepper. I also added 1/4 cup of capers and it was amazing! My picky son even loved it!

With a few alterations, turned it to BAM! Use the juice of capers instead of vinegar, and sautee grape tomato in olive oil with a touch of garlic.

Fantastic! I used less onion, more feta cheese (tomato basil flavored as well), more tomato and excluded the parsley and the artichoke marinade for the dressing. Instead I used the recipe for "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" on this site and it made the salad AMAZING! Obviously this recipe makes a lot, so I trimmed it down so that it equalled a cup of dressing and poured it over the whole salad. You will not be disappointed! Enjoy!

Wonderful salad! I served this alongside Lamb Chops with Balsalmic Reduction (on this site) and it was a fabulous Mediterranean meal. There were several people who commented that this salad lacked flavor - I did not have that complaint whatsoever. The flavor from the marinade and all of the ingredients was light and perfect, in my opinion. I did add a bit of salt to mine as well.

This was just okay for us...I'm an Orzo novice so I wasn't sure wether to rinse it or not - so I did. Made this early in the day so it could chill & drizzled the artichoke marinade just prior to serving as directed. The addition of salt & pepper helped a bit, not that it bad, it was just o.k.

This was pretty good. I left out the black olives only because I am not a fan. I loved the flavors in the dish, and next time I am going to use a little more feta cheese. I added some dill weed in place of lemon pepper. This is a great summer salad. Thanks for sharing.

This salad was delicious! I like to be sure the orzo is still warm when i mix in the other ingredients; it slightly melts the feta and it becomes very creamy. This is a new summertime favorite in my house!

I made this for a party yesterday and everyone loved it!  Many asked for this recipe.  The only change I made, per the reviews, was to add some greek dressing for a little extra zing.    I made it all a day ahead, but didn't add the dressing until a couple hours before serving.

This is an excellent, cool summer salad - I used about 1/2 c. feta only because that was all I had and it was still fine and try adding a little honey to sweeten it   :)

This was excellent and a perfect side dish to grilled hamburgers!  In addition to the artichoke marinade, i added the juice from one whole lemon and a small amount of greek dressing.  Instead of red onion, i used green onion...just a personal preference.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers today for lunch!

Yes, fresh tasting but, lacking depth of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly & found that it needed some 'kick'.  Maybe it's the marinade from the artichokes that is the boring part, the other ingredients were definitley Greek,  I think a good homemade Italian dressing would be more flavorful as other members have mentioned.

I left out the artichokes, lemon pepper, and red onion and used fresh oregano rather than dried.  I used olive oil, not a lot, mixed with fresh lemon juice, salt, and the fresh oregano for the dressing.  Overall, it was really good.

Nice refreshing salad. Used kalamata olives otherwise kept to the recipe. It really does make a lot, maybe the 6 servings means a main dish serving instead of a side. Next time I think I will use somewhat less orzo.

I did make some small changes. I didn't have marinated artichokes, just the ones in the can. I also added spinach, the zest of a lemon, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. I also added about 3 tbls of red wine vinegar as I didn't have the juice from the artichokes, and few swirls of olive oil. I thought a cup and half of orzo was way to much, so reduced to 1 cup, which made plenty. I paired with grilled sea scallops. Overall delish light and easy dinner! I'll be sure to make again.

This was really good.  I made it "as is" the first time I served it, with the B.L.A.T wraps off this site.  I made it agian today with just a few tweaks.  I used a little bit more feta, as we really love cheese, and I finely minced 2 garlic cloves and added that as well.  I forgot to buy fresh parsely, so I added some fresh basil instead and that was GREAT! We love salads that have bold flavors and the addition of the fresh garlic adds a very bold, and just a teeny bit of a sort of spicy flavor that we love.  Otherwise I didn't change anything, this recipe is great for those who don't care for the standard boring macaroni type salads with mayo.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Made homemade greek dressing, like others skipping the marinated version of artichoke hearts for healthier canned version. Only used one can of olives to save a bit of fat too. Excellent salad, every bit disappeared!

Simple, fresh and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought this had plenty of flavor.  I served this with Greek Chicken from this site.  I will be making this again.

Very refreshing salad.  Love the fact the dressing is so light.  Was an excellent side dish with Abby Benner's Souvlaki recipe and Greek Tzatziki by Leelee Cooks.

I had plain pasta left, so I did not use orzo. According to some reviewers I added garbanzo beans, green onions instead of red and sundried tomatoes. I did not have artichokes neither cucumber. For marinade I used Balsamic Dressing. Then just spiced up with black pepper, oregano and garlic powder. Worked out pretty good.

This was so tasty.  I did chop the artichokes (didn't know if you are supposed to) and used 1/2 the artichoke marinade.  I served it with gyros and it was awesome!

This was just all right for me.  First of all, it makes a TON of pasta.  Unless you're willing to eat it as a main course (which I wouldn't want to do), it's at least eight servings.  As written, the flavor is boring.  I stepped it up with some roasted red peppers and Greek vinaigrette, but it's still nothing special.  I left out the cucumber (too much trouble) and added a lot more tomato than the recipe called for.  Even then, it was just okay.  I probably won't make this again.

We loved this! So light and fresh-although I did make up my own Greek vinegarette dressing after reading other reviews, using the drained artichoke marinade as the base, and adding more olive oil, lemon juice, wine vinegar, garlic, oregano and salt and pepper. Fresh flat leaf parsley is a must! Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch.

I toasted the orzo with garlic and sea salt then added chicken broth to cook it. The result was flavorful and I didn't really need to add much artichoke oil.

I didn't think this recipe really had all that much flavor.  The serving size was really huge too--way too much for two people for sure.  I won't make this again.

YUMMY!  I did not add the pepper, or parsely (did not like/have) and it still turned out so yummy!  I made it with grilled chicken that I had marinated in fresh lime juice a little kosher salt. Delicious when mixed with the salad!

ABSOLUTELY delicous.  I followed the other comments and used a VERY small amount of greek dressing, added at the last minute, instead of the oily artichoke marinade.  I used cherry tomatoes, and left the olives on the side for those who like them.  This got RAVE reviews at our dinner party of 6.  Try this, you'll LOVE it!  I'm so glad I doubled the recipe for my family picnic this weekend.  I hear it's even better after a few days.

I loved this salad! I knew it was going to make a TON so I cut back on the amount of everything by about a third and still ended up with plenty. I really enjoyed the way the flavors worked together; it was very satisfying. I would be proud to take this dish to any get-together with family and friends this summer. Thanks Patrice!

Another winner though I agree with many of you who said it needed salad dressing.  I omitted the liquid from the can of artichokes and used a light Ceaser dressing which gave it plenty of zip.  I also marinaded the artichoke hearts in the dressing while I assembled the rest of the salad and added them along with the the dressing.

This one didn't have enough flavor with just the artichoke marinade and lemon alone. I omit the feta to keep it healthy and use white onions to keep the husband happy. But I had to add a vinaigrette dressing to make it more moist and zesty. Everyone liked it with the dressing, though.

I thought this was good, I even served it warm, however I only used one SMALL onion and my husband and I feel it overpowered the entire salad, maybe next time I would use 1/4 of a small onion or none at all.

Be sure to have plenty of people to eat this as the recipe makes a ton!  The ingredients are all wonderful and go together well, but there's a little something missing and I still can't figure out what it is (maybe a tangy dressing?).  My family loved it, though, and kept packing if for lunches, eating it for dinner as a side dish, etc.

I loved this! It is one of my all time favorite summer salads. I thought it was good the only thing I did different was used fresh oregano. I served this with "grecian pork ternderloin" which is also from this website.

I've been wanting to make this for months but never had all the ingredients at the right time.  I used all of the salad ingredients, but opted to use "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" and the juice of one lemon for the dressing instead of the artichoke oil & herbs that it called for.  It was a very nice salad.  I good change from the mayo based salads.

This is good with or without the red onions. Kalamata olives are good in place of the black ones, depending on your taste. Also, I use a block of feta and cube it instead of the already crumbled stuff which tends to get lost in the salad. Seasoned feta is also very nice. Tastes just fine omitting the parsley and lemon juice if you don't have them on hand and I never use the lemon pepper.

Tastes just as good the next day after a night in the fridge.

This was an EXCELLENT side dish for a chicken dinner or for burgers -- a great summer salad!  Great fresh taste!  I also used Greek salad dressing instead of the marinade, and used pitted kalamata olives rather than regular black olives.  If your grocery doesn't carry anything called "Orzo" look for "Rise" -- or basically any pasta shape that looks like rice grains.  Make sure to only cook pasta "al dente" or it will be a little sticky.

great addition to our Memorial Day picnic with family and friends. This one went quick. It makes quite a lot of orzo- I added more cucs, tomotoes, and olives to mine.

Pretty good.  I couldn't find the orzo pasta, so I used Pennette (smaller penne pasta), and it worked out allright.  I might make it again, but tweak the recipe a little.  You do have to cut the feta into chunks, because if you crumble it, it will disappear in the salad.

First time I made this exactly as the recipe called. It was a big hit with the family and at the July 4th party we went to.  Instead of the black olives, I now use green olives. It gives it an extra tangy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper either way.

Never used orzo before and won’t again. The instructions should have said to completely cool the cooked orzo before combining with the other ingredients. There was enough warmth left that when combining the orzo and other ingredients it created a slimy mess that smelled ok but was a disgusting texture. Not really excited to try it again, would rather have had a salad with crisp veggies.

I am rating this based on the suggested changes and my own changes. I am currently eating low carb (kind of a dirty keto woe) and used riced cauliflower(made twice once baking the riced cauliflower and once just straight out of the bag- loved both) instead of orzo pasta. I also used the dressing from Dining Diva- Instead of using the artichoke marinade. Use 6 tbsp olive oil, 5 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoon dried oregano. And did 1/2 black olives and 1/2 kalamata olives. It was amazing and very keto/low carb friendly.

Excellent recipe and a total party pleaser.  Just as an FYI,  1 1/2 cups of dried orzo makes a  bunch!!  I had to add more cucumbers and tomatoes as there was so much cooked orzo!   Will definitely make it again!

I made this for a bbq this past weekend and it was the hit of the day!!  Easy to make and much flavor.  I opted for miniature cucumbers instead of the larger ones, The only change I would make is to add a little more artichoke.  Its light and cool and fresh!!

Love this salad & so did everyone else.  Would probably cut back orzo to 1 cup next time.  I just like less pasta.

This is my new "go to dish" for any picnic, bring a dish party, etc.  This is  a wonderfully light and refreshing salad that would be good ALL year.

Love this recipe! Always a request teamed up with BBQ chicken. We love the recipe just the way it is directed, but enjoy reading how others change it up! Thanks for another great recipe!

I really liked this salad. I made some changes to the dressing like others suggested and left out the artichoke because I’m not fond of it.  I also used kalamata olives, which added a nice flavour.

I made this recipe for a Lunch barbecue for a few friends and family. I made enough for 20 people and they only variation to the recipe was that I did not use black olives due to the fact that there were several people in the family who didn’t like them. I personally will add them the next time I make this recipe and will use it again it was delicious and a big hit with everybody!

This was delicious and very simple... a great make-ahead dish. I used leftover orzo, and my small changes were to use kalamata olives instead of black, Greek dressing instead of the marinade from the artichokes, two seeded Roma tomatoes, and a shallot instead of a red onion. I also used fresh herbs from our garden. I cut all the veggies pretty finely for consistency, and it turned out to be a light and tasty early summer meal. you could easily add marinated shrimp or chicken for a heartier version, but this suited us just fine. Hubby and I agree... it's a keeper!

Tastes really good, but it does make a lot - way more than six servings!  Like others, I used a good bottled Greek Salad dressing (not a creamy one made with yogurt, but an oil and vinegar based one with feta cheese and Greek spices) instead of using the artichoke brine.   I used  sliced kalamata olives, halved grape tomatoes, and English cucumbers so that I didn't need to seed them.  I doubled the feta, cucumbers, tomatoes and olives, and gave it an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and a splash of white wine vinegar, as the salad dressing didn't seem to have enough oomph.   I think that refrigerating it overnight melded the flavors together well.  It was very popular at my potluck BBQ!

This was quick to throw together and tasted fantastic! I didn't use the marinade from the artichokes because it was made of water and oil. Instead I drizzled extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar over the salad. I also used goat cheese instead of feta. I will make this again next time I'm asked to "bring a dish"!

Made it Saturday for a Monday work party based on reviews that said it is better a day or two later. But I snuck some for dinner and it was pretty good. I made other suggested changes as well. So I am rating based being a great base that is flexible to modification. Can't wait to see how it turns out on Monday.

Perhaps this would be better if I used a different brand of artichokes (I used Cento brand), but the flavor was pretty awful with a sour aftertaste that lingered. I think this would taste so much better with a fresh dressing made simply from lemon juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and more fresh seasonings. The lemon pepper doesn’t work here, and fresh oregano would be much better.

Used Dining Diva’s oil and vinegar recommendation and canned artichokes rather than marinated. Also used yellow onion instead of red because it was on hand. Red would be better. It even better the third day- make ahead! Yummy with sliced up chicken mixed in for lunch also.

This complimented our Venison Gyros ..... followed as directed this is awesome, no dressing used just the Orzo and the Veggies and the juice from the meat ... which was minimal but absolutly perfect dipping bread and flour tortillas!

I liked all the ingredients - and added my usual DIY Greek spice blend as well. I didn’t really like the lemon flavour. Will try with balsamic or red wine vinegar next time. I counterbalances the acidic taste with some stevia and that helped.

It was so wonderful! Now I did use goat cheese instead of feta, because for some reason I just, really dislike feta. (I really don't like olives either, but I found I genuinely enjoyed them in this pasta salad.) So mine was more of a creamy pasta salad. But it was so delicious! I made it for a work luncheon, and everyone really enjoyed it.

The fresh parsley was a little overwhelming. I will not add it the next time I make it. I also used a greek salad dressing and no artichokes. I added rotisserie chicken to make it a meal.

The salad itself is great, but my husband and I agree that it was a bit flavorless. Had I seen the review to add red wine vinegar instead of the artichoke marinade I would have done that. Might still do that with the leftovers. Other than that, it was great for a hot day when I didn’t want to eat anything warm.

I did as another reviewer recommended.  6 tablespoons of oil (I had some lemon Olive oil so used 2 tbls of that and 4 regular olive oil) and also 5 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of dried lemon peel and 1 tsp of dried greek oregano.  A little splash of the artichoke marinade as well.  Without all of the above it seemed drab and dry.
I used cherry tomatoes in lieu of a whole large tomatoes also.

Loved this! Made it for a large family gathering and it was a hit. Per other suggestions I added more lemon juice, used a Greek salad dressing instead of the artichoke marinade, kalamata olives and added some pepperoncini.

I really liked this. I think it’s a smoother version of a typical pasta salad you’d find at a Fourth of July picnic because of the orzo. I did as others suggested and added the marinade ahead of time to let everything soak up the flavor. I will be making this again.

I had to wait  to make this for Canada Day because our family like to make all our favourites  then nominate one person to make a new salad for our feast. This was  my year and I choice  this Greek salad.  It is great  and will be used at many BBQ's  in the coming years.  Thanks you our family eats well  every day of the year not just holidays

This is a gréât salad. It's simple to make. It makes a lot so it's gréât if you're having a party or going to a party.  I did follow the suggestion of a reviewer who said to use olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice and dried oregano for the dressing. If you like Greek salad, you'll like this salad.  Also, I used the grape tomatoes and cut them in half.  In my area, the regular tomatoes are tasteless until late in the summer. Please don't complain about my minor changes and the five star rating. Sometimes we all just have to tweak a little bit.

This was awesome! Used reduced fat feta, and only half the artichoke out of caution that it was going to be too strong. Will definitely use the full amount next time, but even with the half it was delicious!!

It was okay.  Needs something different, but can't put my finger on what, and didn't love the addition of the artichoke hearts.

The Greek Orzo Salad was  REALLY GOOD! It was colorful and delicious. I did not add the artichoke hearts and olives because I'm not a big fan of those. I also added olive oil instead of lemon juice and added some Tavern Ham. I will DEFINITELY make this dish again. 100%

this is a really yummy salad! lots of prep time, tho I tripled the recipe thus tripling prep time. I personally would use less orzo next time or even leave out the pasta all together. I really love all the ingredients and the flavors and spices mesh well together. Will definately make agian!

I like that it does not waste anything, using the liquid from the artichokes as the dressing. Yummy and colorful salad, great for potlucks.

I don't do artichokes, but other than that, I always try to make a recipe as written - at least the first time. It was pretty good, but it was better the second time around, when I merged with another recipe. I just thought it was a little bland, but I recognize that my preferences are just that: personal, and not everyone will agree with them. Thanks for a good starting place.

I dressed this one up a bit. I added Parmesan cheese.  The feta was sun-dried tomato. Nice addition. Also added Kalamata olives.

Came out great. The only thing i would alter is I only used 1 jar of marinated artichoke hearts and I would add less of juice from the jar and more lemon juice.  I also like more black pepper added.

This pasta salad is a hit every time I make it!  I love the crunchiness of the  cucumbers and red onions as well as the greek flavors of feta, tomato, olives and artichoke hearts.  The orzo doesn't overpower the salad like some pastas do.  The only change I make is to add my favorite Italian Dressing instead of the oil from the artichoke hearts.  It adds a little more zesty flavor that I enjoy.

I first made it as written;For me it rated 3 stars.The next time I used artichoke hearts without marinade.The onion was too strong,I don't like any one taste dominating the dish, so I used chopped scallions instead.I also used cherry tomatoes and English cucumber.I made a simple dressing of evoo and wine vinegar and sprinkled the feta before serving.An important change is to make it the day before,it makes a big difference to have the flavors meld.Take out of the refrigerator for a couple of hours and serve at room temperature.

Great versatile recipe! I left out the olives and doubled the feta. As other users suggested, I replaced half the artichoke marinade with red wine vinegar. Will be making this again!

I just made this salad and it's AMAZING. Not sure what others are saying about it being bland and doctoring it up. I made it exactly and it's sooooooo goooood ! I think the key is putting the cooked orzo in about 3 to 4 minutes after it's made. It's going to be a staple in my salad repitoir

I made this recipe exactly as written, and that is what I'm rating.   
I have to say I was disappointed....too bland and it just didn't taste good.   I had to doctor it up quite a bit.   Definitely will not make this recipe again as written.

Loved it! I went with some reviewer recomendations, such as adding more lemon juice and red onion and throwing in olive oil and greek dressing ingredients (mustard, garlic, and tumeric,) and it made it all the better.

Other readers were correct about not enough dressing just from the liquid in the marinated artichokes.
I made my own vinaigrette and that worked out ok

Omitted onions, olives,  artichokes, lemon juice and lemon pepper. Used fresh mushrooms,  cucumbers, tomatoes and chives.  For dressing used Italian and a small amount of red wine vinegar. Cooked one cup of orzo and was plenty for two meals for the two of us.

Very good side to serve with grilled lamb chops!  Didn't have artichokes or olives, so diced up some colored bell peppers.  Used the olive oil, lemon and red wine vinegar idea that another user posted.  Turned out great!!

Yummy!  Fresh and delicious, I'll definitely make again.  Next time I'll follow suggestions and add a little red wine vinegar too.

Definitely super dry. I had to add quite a bit of olive oil and more lemon juice than the recipe called for to make it palatable.

This was really tasty. I made my own vinaigrette instead of using the juice from the artichokes. The vinaigrette was inspired by Greek Salad III.
Also, I added chopped green peppers as in that recipe. Overall it was a big hit.

We all loved it. Took it to a party, the salad was completely gone. Instead of using lemon juice and artichoke juice , I instead used Italian dressing

I made this as my side for my Family's Thanksgiving 2016. I wanted something different and something cold I could easily make the night before and that would stand the long drive. 

I used what I had so everything was the same except Kalamata olives instead of black and I mixed in some Greek vinaigrette. I used an italian seasoning blend. I bet the no salt added Greek seasoning would be good! 

I will definitely make again, I will probably mix some tzatziki dressing next time for a more creamy salad!

Loved it. I meant to try some of the reviewers' suggestions, but then I was in a hurry last night for something to go with  a simple steak dinner and didn't take time to read them. At my son's request,  I did substitute 1 c of brown basmati rice for the 1-1/2 c orzo, and only 1/4 tsp lemon pepper and a couple slices of a big red onion just because, but this was really tasty. Definitely making this again (and I will try some of those suggestions next time).

Good. and refreshing made this for a picnic.  Followed the recipe, it was good but definitely needed more seasoning.  Next time I will try other reviewers suggestions of adding Greek salad dressing.

Great salad! I made this yesterday morning for my kids to take to school for lunch . . . I laid all of the ingredients out on my kitchen island, and then went to my pantry to grab the orzo. Guess what? NO ORZO! I did have a bag of specialty spiral pasta that I bought for who knows what, so I went ahead and made it with that instead of the orzo. You really can use any pasta that you have on hand. I'm sure this is equally as delicious with the orzo that it calls for. Either way - we loved it!

I tried to follow the recipe as is, but the one tomato I had was bad, and I had artichoke 'salad' instead of marinated artichoke hearts. So there were some additional green olives and pimento in my salad. I used the marinade from the artichoke salad. No tomatoes. This turned out to be quite tasty. My family liked it. Next time I might try adding some additional dressing as someone suggested. This would be a good 'road trip' salad. Taken along in a cooler for lunch along the way at a roadside park.  I would make it again!

Simple and quick to make. It's very flavorful. The only tweak I made was add a little salt. It looks pretty on a clear bowl too.

This is a great summer salad.  I made it as stated only changing the black olives for kalamata olives.  Then I tweaked the flavors by adding more feta and the artichoke marinade.  We love these flavors and like them to be bold.  I'll make this again.

There aren't many changes you can make to this salad to make it better. It's one of the most flavorful salads I've had and gets better as it ages. I didn't have red onion so I used shallots which worked. I've prepared it twice and it is really, really good.

Didn't think much of it when I made it, but wow. I skipped the olives and added avocado and OMG! You've gotta add avocados! I've made this 5 times in the last 2 weeks and everyone keeps asking for it. I brought it to dinner at the in-laws and they always ask to keep the leftovers. So good and fresh tasting. The avocados is a must-have.

I'm so glad and I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for the perfect July 4th side dish. I'm a little different from the other reviews in that I really like the liquid from the artichoke. I just added a little extra lemon juice and half of the red onion. I made my husband go out and buy red wine vinegar after reading the other reviews after I already had the other ingredients but then after I tasted it I realized I was fine without the vinegar. But I did add olive oil . I will definitely be making this again as my husband enjoyed it and so did my neighbor. Next time I'll have some spinach and maybe even some chicken but really it's fine the way it is.

It was very good.  We didn't have artichoke hearts so I subbed asparagus and added sugar snap peas.  Made a nice side for the Greek meatball recipe I got from Thaao Penghlis' book "Seducing Celebrities"

I made this today for lunch. I omitted the tomato and left the feta on the side (my brother-in-law can't eat feta). I wasn't a huge fan of just using the marinade from the artichokes for the dressing so I took another reviewers advice and made a dressing of extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, oregano, and salt. I loved the tang from the vinegar and definitely brightened up the salad! Next time I think I'll include some homemade croutons for added crunch. Overall, a really good salad!

Super yummy. I made a few minor changes. Skipped the artichoke because my family is not a fan. Followed the advice of others and added 6 tbsp of olive oil and 5 tbsp of red wine vinegar after chilling the salad for an hour. Also used basil instead or oregano and black pepper instead of lemon pepper. Added an extra tbsp of lemon juice instead. Also chopped the cucumbers, tomato and onion fairly small. Only used less than 1/2 red onion and it was still plenty, probably could have used even less.

I left out the tomatoes (needed the ones I had for another use) and used the oil/vinegar/oregano dressing as other reviewers have done, and it was FANTASTIC.   I served it at a potluck and it got rave reviews.   As others here have done, I made the orzo the night before and let the dressing soak into it; I added the veggies an hour before serving.   Two thumbs up!

This recipe is a great jumping off point to add your own flair.  I make it very much the same but add celery, pickled beets, green onion in the place of Red onion sometimes and it is also good with green or red peppers.  I also add a cup of Greek vinagrette 

And it is always better the 2nd day :)

It really takes a lot to impress my husband and he loved this. I know people were changing the recipe but I think the key is to make sure the feta is super creamy. Don't buy pre crumbled feta! I didn't and the feta itself gave the salad a really nice flavor.

I thought this recipe was just okay. It could have been the lemon pepper seasoning I used because they're all so different. Or, it could have been the fact that my artichokes weren't marinated, which I think was a good thing because the seasoning in the marinated artichokes along with the lemon pepper, oregano, and parsley would DEFINITELY have been too much spice. I don't know what it was, I can't quite put my finger on it, but I was not a fan and neither was anyone else that tried it at our family BBQ. I'll keep looking for "the" pasta salad recipe!

I will make this A LOT.  Only thing I changed is that I didn't buy marinated artichokes, so I drained them and mixed them into the salad, then at the end I juiced one lemon and drizzled maybe 1/4 cup of olive oil.

Very good! Made it for the first time last night, and my boyfriend loved it! Our only suggestion was use a small red onion, or half of a medium or large one, as the onion was a tiny overwhelming.

I took this to a party and it did not last very long! I did not have artichoke so I used Dining Diva's substitution idea and it worked out great. I will definitely make this again soon.

this is delicious even without the artichoke hearts.  I skipped them, and tossed the orzo with a couple TBL olive oil, then let cool in the fridge a couple of hours before proceeding. I added a couple TBL of fresh mint and used fresh oregano since I had it handy. Sprinkle with a little paprika for added color and zing!

This was delicious!!  I saw a similar salad at our local Whole Foods market, but I didn't want to spend a fortune to buy some.  I decided to try this recipe, and my husband and I were both blown away.  Very refreshing taste with all the right ingredients.  I sometimes omit the red onions if I don't feel like having "onion breath." =)  Everything else was perfect!

I've made this recipe more than a few times, and I have to say that is one of my absolute favorites. I don't add the tomato and onion, and, unless I serve it warm, I don't add the feta until after it's been chilled for about an hour.

Great recipe. It was a great crowd pleaser at the BBQ and even better as leftovers for lunch the next day. I did make some small modifications based on the other reviews and what i had in the house. I used fresh basil rather than oregano. I didn't have any lemon pepper so i just used regular pepper. The other reviews suggested Greek salad dressing instead of the artichoke marinade so i used Cesar salad dressing (didn't have any Greek). Turned out great.

Meh. I didn't hate this, but I certainly didn't like it that much either. For one, this was WAAAAY too dry. As a last resort, I added several generous squirts of Wishbone Italian dressing, but that didn't help much nor did it add any flavor (which this salad also lacks). I wish I would have taken other's suggestions to add my own homemade Greek vinaigrette to this (I've been wanting to try Fabulous Greek House/Dressing), but then I might as well not write a review because I would not be rating this recipe as it was intended to be (and what would be the point in doing that???). Served alongside Turkey Gyros (Judy), this was a light, but seriously mediocre meal. Good thing I had a big lunch! Oh, and I only made half the recipe and still had a TON of food  leftover (which sadly, went in the trash). Thanks for sharing anyways, Patrice. :-)

Delicious! I did not have artichoke hearts (and I really wish I did, this would have been even better!) and I used kalamata olives instead of black olives since that's what I had on hand.  Will be making again this week AFTER I go to the store for artichoke hearts!

This was okay but I think it might just be that it didn't suit my personal preference. I am not a huge fan of orzo but I had some that I wanted to use up so I decided on this recipe. I left out the cucumber because I am not a fan. This didn't really have a wow factor for me. It was fine. I ate it. Just not something I can rave about.

My husband and I really liked it, but the kids wouldn't touch it.  Seems like it needs a bit more kick -- it just relies on the marinade from the artichokes. I don't understand why it wants you to add the marinade right before eating -- it really needs to soak in. I will try adding 1/2 cup greek dressing next time like other people suggest. Yummy with grilled shrimp from this site.

This recipe is great!  I couldn't find marinated artichokes so I marinated plain artichokes in the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing also on this website, threw in the reserved dressing after it was all assembled, and it was absolutely delicious!

Wonderful as everyone said!! If you want to turn this salad into the main event just add some grilled chicken. For a healthier version try using low fat feta and lite greek salad dressing. A great summer dish around patio!!

LOVE this recipe.  Found it after having Starbucks orzo pasta salad and was looking for something similar.  I added chopped roasted red pepper instead of tomato, and less olives - I don't care for them, but added them anyway.  I also didn't measure the lemon juice or seasonings, just did it to taste, and added the marinade from the artichokes right away.  I couldn't wait an hour to try it, so had some right away.  Again...LOVE IT.  Had it again with dinner, and hubby thought I bought it, as it was so "professional".  Will definitely make this again!

yummy. I love orzo for a pasta salad. I served it a party for the ladies that I was hosting and they though that it was good. The sauce could use a little punch of something though. Not quiet sure what to add...

This recipe is awesome. Definately one of my most favorite from this website. It is a great recipe for those hot summer months, when you are tired of eating so many lettuce salads. I found that using a food processor to chop the veggies make things easier. Another great thing about this salad is that you can make it and keep eating it for the rest of the week. It seems to taste even better as time goes by.

I adore this recipe. I always add a bottle of Greek Salad dressing  to this salad, and it's HEAVENLY. It is absolutely yummy. I usually don't have red onion on hand, so I usually end up adding green onion instead. Yum. Yum. YUM. I found bacon & sun dried tomato feta cheese and used it today - so good! My daughter loves it, too. There is some serious yumminess in this recipe.

Very good recipe.  Next time I will be sure to use marinated artichokes as I think that was the only problem with my version.  I really liked this salad.  My husband, who is NOT a picky eater didn't really care for it though.

Absolutely wonderful.  I only used half of the reserved artichoke sauce and added about 2 tablespooons of Hellman's mayo.  Hubby loved it, I loved it and 5 year old son liked the feta cheese crumbles!  Would make again for sure!

This is oh so good. The blend of flavors is wonderful. Make it ahead of time and add a little more dressing (if needed) right before serving. The orzo is a wonderful change from the usual pasta. Everyone loved it.

Very good, but it does make a lot.  I had three very hungry men, and still had lots left.  Used some italian dressing with lemon zest instead of the lemon juice etc... good make ahead side dish for a grilled mediterranean meal.

Yummy.....I only had 1/2c. orzo left, so I scaled down the recipe to taste. I loved it....very fresh and tasty. Served with Greek chicken burgers which have, the red onion,garlic, spinach, oregano, feta, etc. I grilled those and served with this salad and a tossed salad. Will make again, I omitted the olives since I had none on hand. I will make again, and loved the marinated artichokes with their liquid as part of the dressing!

We love this salad! The only changes I make are to add more chopped tomato and cucumber, 'cause we like our veggies, and to add a splash of lemon juice to stretch the artichoke marinade and give it a bit of extra zip. I usually serve this with a Greek-style marinated chicken, but tried it last week with Pork Chop and Feta Skillet for a change of pace. Yummy!

DELICIOUS! 
This made a super easy weeknight dinner with the addition of some shrimp. 

I followed prior comments about adding red wine vinegar. I also added all of the olive marinade (I used napa valley wine marinated olives--fantastic.) 

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was a great idea!  I used an orzo/quinoa/chick pea mix Trader Joe's sells (it's mostly orzo) as the base and a homemade Greek dressing.

So easy and good! I was going to make some for myself, and some for my boyfriend, but instead, had this for two days in a row. I did replace the dressing with a pre-made oregano and feta dressing, but it was just delicious. Be careful to cook the orzo until just al dente! Otherwise you end up with mushy salad. Will make again, since it is so easy to modify.

I didn't like this very much.  The dressing was too light...I couldn't even taste it.  I went out and bought some Italian dressing and poured some of that in and it was a little better.  Don't think I'll try this one again.

Very Greek tasting.  Makes a big bowl full.  I used an English cucumber and two tomatoes seeded and the juice of half a lemon. I didn't have any red onion so I used half of a sweet onion and it was still very tastey.  Mmm...

Great recipe! But like some of the other comments, I too had to add more dressing to the recipe.  My family and I felt like it needed a vinegar-type flavor, so I added an "oil and vinegar" dressing.  It made this salad just wonderful!

This turned out to be nice and light, unlike other similar style recipes. I used a red bell pepper b/c I had no tomato, and I used less of the reserved marinade thinking it'd still be moist but not soggy. In the future, I'll probably cut whole feta into chunks instead of using the precrumbled feta, which tends to get lost in the salad. This dish was great with grilled chicken.

The grocery store was out of Orzo so I used mini penne pasta instead.  It was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly (which is rare) & it came out perfect...wouldn't change a thing!!  I made this with feta chicken (also from All Recipes & one of my favorites) and sautéed zucchini, talk about a flavorful, healthy & delicious meal!!

Easy to make and tastes great.  I've always loved this salad in the deli and this is my first time making it.  I also used Kalamata olives instead.  My fiance does not like feta cheese or olives, so I made him a batch without - he said it was great - but I think the cheese and olives really make the dish :)

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It is delicious! Very simple and easy to make. I chopped the onion up very fine and chopped the cucumber and tomato in small pieces. I used marinated artichoke hearts and chopped those up to. It sat in the fridge overnight and we ate it the next day. VERY VERY GOOD!

This salad was very bland and oily when made as instructed.  Maybe the brand of marinated artichoke hearts makes a difference- we used Goya. Would not make this recipe again.

This is just wonderful.  Make sure to use good quality marinated artichokes since a lot of flavor comes from the juice.  I only used 1/2 of a red onion and it was enough for my family.

I liked this salad, but there was too much onion and it overtook the other flavors.  Next time, I'll probably omit the onion altogether - or maybe only use half.

very good!  Even my toddler asks to eat it.

I did not have marinated artichokes so I used regular canned artichoke hearts and added some reduced fat Italian salad dressing.

We will definitely have this again!

This turned out very good.  A good swirl of balsamic vinegar makes it extra nice.

Great salad!!! I'm also not a big onion fan so I used sliced red bellpepper instead and it was wonderful. I will make this again.

Very good!  Since I'm not a big onion fan, I cut down the amount to half an onion from a whole one and it worked just fine.

I had this salad at a friends house and I had to have the recipe.  It is one of the best pasta salads that I have ever had.  J
