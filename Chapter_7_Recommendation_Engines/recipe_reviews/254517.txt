So simple and basic that I have this recipe memorized.  Best with home grown tomatoes!  I use about 12.  To peel tomatoes, be sure to view the allrecipes video "How to Peel, Seed, and Dice Tomatoes".  VARIATIONS:  for a smoother/thicker sauce add half-stick butter.  for a different flavor add 1/4 cup red cooking wine and/or meat.  for a more Italian aroma add 1 tbsp fresh oregano.  for more "kick" add 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes.

This is so easy and good. Making up a huge batch to freeze as we speak. We use Roma tomatoes from the garden. Only modifications are fresh garlic vs garlic powder and onion powder instead of chopped onions for the kiddo. When I make this for dinner, I put the dry spaghetti noodles in the sauce to cook them-  it thickens the sauce a bit and the noodles somehow taste better and have a better texture...! If we want meat, I brown large Italian sausages and then throw them in with the sauce and noodles. Truly a one pot dinner.

08.20.16 ~ A nice sauce to have on hand. I bought a bushel of tomatoes, and used part of them to make this sauce. I tripled the recipe so I would have extra to freeze. At the end of the simmer time, I used my immersion blender and chopped everything a little finer, and simmered for one more hour. The results were a nice thicker sauce that worked great on spaghetti and as a pizza sauce. I froze three quart bags to have this winter.

Great easy recipe. I actually did not peel the tomatoes as I was lazy that day and it still turned out great. We also added  sausage and served it over spiralized raw zucchini...delicious!

I would have given 5 stars, but I always feel weird doing that if I've made changes.  My changes weren't for any good reason, i.e. I didn't think things needed to be changed, per se.  Anyway, I used 12 tomatoes (1 or 2 were pretty small), I used 2 tablespoons grated carrot instead of sugar, 2 cloves of garlic instead of powder, I added 2 tablespoons Rose wine (it's what I had and I like to add wine), I used chopped fresh parsley and basil, and this hot pepper flake called Red Neck Pepper - the Italian blend - to taste.  I attempted to follow the recommendation of one person to use immersion blender after an hour or so and then reduce for 1-2 more hours to make thicker sauce, but then I decided to make Pioneer Woman's Meatballs and that meant more time simmering anyway while I made those.  I ended up having to add back in liquid to cover the meatballs and allow for 30 more minutes simmering time to cook the meatballs - 1 cup water + 1 tsp Better than Bouillon.  I prob used 1/2 of that, liquid, but again, that was eye-balling it.   So, was this fantastic because of the meatballs?  I don't know, but I sure as heck will be using it again when I have fresh tomatoes.

Except for adding some red wine to the sauce, I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce itself was fantastic, and I'll use this sauce anytime I need a fresh tomato sauce. In this case, though, once I added some meat to the sauce (for lasagna), quite frankly it went really bland. It didn't stand up to the meat at all. So I don't think this is an ideal sauce for meatballs, etc., but just over a bed of pasta, it was amazing.

This is a great starter recipe. I have cooked this three times but use all fresh ingredients instead of dried. I also added mushrooms and spinach this time turned out great everyone ask for the recipe. 
Reason I give 4 starts instead of 5 is because it used dried ingredients.

Great flavor, but next time I'll use just s bit less sugar. I also used basil paste instead of dried basil, but did use dried oregano. I used baby Roma tomatoes and did not skin them before cooking. After cooking for about an hour, I used a hand-held immersion blender to mix it all together. Couldn't tell there were any skins whatsoever!! We will most definitely make this again!

This recipe turned out great. I made a couple substitutions which worked out well. Substituted fresh garlic instead of powder, Italian seasoning instead of the individual herbs, added tomato paste, increased onions to 2, and added a couple dashes of fish sauce for a nice savory flavor. Saut√©ed some Italian sausage with mushrooms and onions, poured this over, and served it with spaghetti. My family gobbled it right up!

I used 3 cloves garlic and didn't peel the tomatoes. About 4 pounds of tomatoes made 2 medium size jars of sauce. Tasty and I can't wait to eat it over spaghetti with garlic bread.

This was the most basic recipe that used fresh tomatoes. I just needed a template, how much of what to use. I blanched, peeled and chopped my tomatoes, then added onions, fresh garlic and spices that needed to be used, to the same pot, to not waste a dish. I used marjoram, thyme, oregano, italian seasoning, sage, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Oh, and I learned 1 lb. tomatoes=4 small, 3 medium, 2 large or 15-20 cherry tomatoes, so that helped me figure out how many tomatoes makes 4 lbs.! Thanks!

This will be my go to spaghetti sauce recipe.  The only thing I changed was fresh basil and parsley.  Fabulous sauce with a hint of sweet.

I made only a few changes to the recipe ... I used fresh garlic instead of powder and added some oregano. I loved it because it is light and not heavy like Prego or Ragu. I'm making batch after batch with home grown Roma tomatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a really good guideline. I had so many tomatoes that were ripe from the garden, I didn't  want them to go to waste so I decided to give it a try. I peeled and actually used my food processor to crush the tomatoes first.  I added extra seasonings, black pepper and also used real garlic and a bit of fresh basil for colour along with the dried, as dried seasonings do pack some flavour. I also tossed in a couple bay leaves when it was simmering. This turned out well and was great to use up those fresh tomatoes!

Excellent, easy & I will definitely make it again. I omitted the onions (don't care for them) & I cut the tomatoes into chunks but I didn't peel them .  Otherwise I followed the recipe
exactly except I put it in a crockpot & let it simmer for several hours until it got very thick. About halfway through the process, I used a potato masher to crush everything & it was  so divine ...  my hubby & I both loved it.  This was my first attempt at making spaghetti sauce from fresh tomatoes & I am glad I chose this recipe .. no need to look any further. It was easier than expected & there was enough sauce left to freeze for 2 more meals.

I made it per directions, was very good.  Next time I would like to try more garlic, like sliced garlic, then also would like to emulsify to make more of a marinara sauce.

Excellent sauce, i think if you added cumin, you might get a very respectable chili sauce. We also added oregano.

I used an orange yellow variety that was somewhat sweet, so I only added a teaspoon of sugar, and that was enough. I also added a tablespoon of oregano, cut the parsley to 1/2 TBSP, and used 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, added with one minute left of sauteeing the onions, and 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper. It cooked down to 5 cups of sauce

I made this 3 times already using homegrown tomatoes. I simmered it with a Parmesan rind and about 1 tlbs. Red wine vinegar. All the kids said it is way better than store bought sauce. Thanks!

This is a delicious base, but didnt quite taste finished so i did have to add a little tomato paste for thickening and then a dash of chili powder to give a little pop of flavor, also added a bit of chicken bullion as another recipe had called for and loved the results!

Been making my Pop's old world sauce for the last 25 or so years. Didnt have all day to slow cook it so I gave this recipe a try and OMG its delish! Made it 3 times this month so far. Goomg to make a double bitch and freeze it for quick meals! Still going to use my Pop's suace for lasagna though........

Note: I added 1/2 teaspoon of cummin and use honey in place of sugar.

This sauce is really easy and so good. I‚Äôve tried other fresh tomato sauce recipes and they were bland. This is so tasty. I did add red pepper flakes because I like a little kick. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Really good recipe! Added some extra rosemary, garlic, and onion to our taste and there weren't any leftovers. Will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe. Have made this multiple times and love as is. I do however like mushrooms and real garlic minus the garlic powder added with extra seasonings (garlic salt, oregano, Italian seasonings). I made a big batch of it as well and froze it.

I enjoyed cooking this for my kids.  I added cilantro and green bell peppers for its color and extra kick.  We live in Hawaii and I fried some Portuguese sausage for the non-vegetarian carnivores in our family.  They loved it with the whole wheat noodles!  Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for sharing this recipe!

This was bursting with flavor.  I used it  on meatball subs.   The chunky sauce was perfect.  The only change I made was using jarred minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Saved to favorites.  Will definitely use again.

Definitely a repeatable! 

I did make a few tweaks, I added browned ground beef, and I added about 1 1/2 TBSP of Balsamic vinegar.   Very yummy

The only changes I made was that I also threw in diced fresh garlic, sliced mushrooms(towards the end),  and a tablespoon of oregano. Best spaghetti sauce I ever ate, which I credit mainly to the fact that I used home grown tomatoes that truly were VINE RIPENED to a ruby red color. It seems it is like beer making in which they say it's all about the water. With spaghetti sauce, I am now convinced it's all about the tomatoes.

Delicious! As per some of the other reviews, I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I also used fresh basil paste (in the produce section) in place of dried and fresh Italian herb paste in place of the dried parsley. I removed seeds and squeezed some juice from tomatoes to make sauce a bit thicker. My 2 year old, picky 4 year old and husband all devoured this and said several times how delicious it was! Make a double batch if you want leftovers!!!

It is currently on the stove I had bought a box of beefsteak tomatoes so decided to use them and make a sauce.  I did increase the amount of garlic powder since I didn't have fresh.  I also made sure not to put all the water from tomatoes in with the mix I chopped and drained the tomatoes and ensured I was adding the seed pods either.  My question is how does it get a deep red color right now is it bordering on pink since I did remove the skins by blanching them.  Any suggestions to get a deeper color but not adding tomato paste would be appreciated.  Will let you know my results once we have gone at least an hour and half into simmering.

whole30 diet caused me to do it this way...
no big changes, but used coconut oil, and no sugar at all. 
 and though I kept looking at the oregano.  decided that  I would try it first, just with these ingredients.  It was superb!  
but I used, instead of spaghetti, a new thing for me, spaghetti squash!  Wow!  how awesome!  
Next time, I'll try to duplicate this, exactly.  It was soooo good!
I had to lessen the portions, because it was just for me.  so, no 4 cups of tomatoes, just started small, so everything was less... and I didn't measure exacts...  
but probably didn't start with enough coconut oil.  just a little of this and that here and there... and when the tomatoes, onions, (and I used fresh garlic)  cooked down, I added more tomatoes & garlic... then I put the browned grass fed hamburger beef in and let them all mix together...  but that meat had hardly any fat so I needed more liquid.... got a little concerned.
Oh!  I forgot something I DID add = Cucumbers?!  the concoction was getting dry and I didn't want to add more liquid, so I had a half of cucumber I needed to use, and I diced it and threw it in, thinking maybe it would give me more juice?!  Can't believe that one, I don't think I've ever thought of cooking cucumber...  has anyone else?  couldn't taste it at all.
Oh, and I chopped up a tiny amount of Pedersen's uncured no sugar added smoked kielbasa... and threw it in... 
Also, I did NOT peel the tomatoes and it turned out great, did not notice anything at all.

It's currently still simmering on the stove but it smells amazing! I made a couple adjustments and additions. For one, I used frozen tomatoes that were from my garden. I added a large can of crushed tomatoes for worry that the frozen tomatoes wouldn't have as much flavour. I also added a red pepper, green pepper, and a jalape√±o pepper from my garden. I made a double batch so I used the same spices except used one tbsp of parsley and one tbsp of Italian spice. So excited for it to finish simmering to try, but my seven year old who helped me tasted it and said it was delicious! Thank you!

I really liked this recipe.  I added all fresh herbs and a little oregano since I had them all growing in my garden.  Also, I chopped up some pepperoni (the kind you put on a pizza) and put that in the sauce too.  This is definitely a keeper for me.

This is a very good and very accurate recipe. The amounts and times are right on. I used fresh basil and left out the sugar altogether. Fresh tomatoes make the best sauce! Thank you for the recipe.
