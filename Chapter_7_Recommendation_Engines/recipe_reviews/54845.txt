This was Great! I didn't want to lose the taste of all the ingredients in the streaming so I steamed the mussels in water, a bit of lime juice and a splash of tequila then used the recipe to pour over mussels when they were done and in the bowl. Very Good.

Quick and easy to make with stuff we had on hand, including jalape√±os. This recipe is better than most restaurants. Didn't change a thing!

I did not like this recipe at all.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because my husband thought they were "ok".  The sauce needs to be thicker, I think, so that the sauce will stick to the mussels.  The flavor was not good, the cilantro overwhelming.  Sorry.

I used vodka instead of tequila and added 3 teaspoons of horseradish too....just for an extra kick.  They were great.

I used olive oil, left out the peppers (both red and jalapeno) but only because I didn't have any on hand. I also left out the water because I used the frozen mussels you can buy in the 2 pound bag. Really good recipe, loved the flavor of the broth - I was afraid that the tequila would be too strong, but it was balanced by the lime juice - I may add more tequila next time! Thanks, Mike for an alternative to white wine broth.

Great change to wine and cream - we loved it and will use again

I fried the chilli with the onion and pepper to reduce the heat and confess that I seldom weigh my ingredients just use the volume and weight given as a guide line, the sauce was good and the balance of flavors were great

Fantastic!! Very good recipe. The tequila and lime add a great touch to this very easy recipe. We left out the Cilantro only because I do not like that flavor.

Do not attempt to substitute canned oysters for Mussels when you cannot find them. NOT a good substitution! I posted a pic of the end result which looked more like a soup.

I had tequila mussels once at a restaurant and loved them, so I wanted to try to make them. I used 1800 silver coconut tequila and they came out fantastic. I'm definitely going to be making these from now on.
