Got the o'k to make this one again from my picky boyfriend. Mmmm, good with applesauce :) Made exactly as stated and it turned out perfect. UPDATE: Cut the recipe in half and cooked it in an 8X8 pan; takes the same amount of time to bake. Yum! Update: I love this recipe! I have found that it tastes better with the cheapie sausages that don't have skin...it's already very economical, and those sausages go on sale for around a buck, excellent meal for when I am feeling cheap!

I used the concept from this recipe plus my pancake mix batter to make this fun treat. Served with sliced strawberries tossed with sugar for a fun breakfast. Thanks!

This is a good dish, I must admit. First off, I didn't know what the heck dried savory was so I used sausage seasoning. It does taste like sausage link in pancakes so I wonder what ground sausage would be like in this? Good dish to make for a morning brunch.

I was looking for a recipe for my picky eater that hates pancakes. Only substitute was thyme as I didn't have savory. The family enjoyed it. Next time I may add parmesean cheese to the batter. Over all good flavor I will be making this again.

My husband really, really liked this. I thought if nothing else he would be entertained but he ate a ton of it and with rave reviews. I made the recipe as described except I halved it. I also threw in some garlic and black pepper. DH said it would be even better with more seasonings in the batter. Very fun and good recipe.

Very similar to the Toad-in-the-Hole that I have made for years.  I serve mine with brown gravy on top - delish!

We enjoyed this--after a long while, which was entirely my fault. I didn't read the part about 9x13 pan, and chose to put it in a 9 inch deep dish pie container. This resulted in it being too deep, and taking too long to cook! It puffs WAY UP in the air while it cooks, and deflates considerably as it cools (which is rather neat to see). As far as flavor goes, I added 1/4 c. dehydrated onions and in the future I will add more spices or flavorings to the bread part.  Someone mentioned cheese, and I think that would be good; also garlic and of course, onions galore :-) My husband called this "Sausage Pie" and was thrilled with it! P.S. To make this recipe work in a pie plate, I believe you need to halve the entire recipe, or use 2 pie plates. Thanks for the recipe, it was unique enough, even with needing some flavor add-ins, to be a keeper!

This was really good! I made it with a whole wheat pancake mix and Apple chicken sausage. Everybody loved it, from the toddlers to the hubby! I will make this again. My husband suggested using a cornbread mix, so I am going to try that next time.

This was good, better than I expected even. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 panm, which worked well. My local grocery store doesn't carry savory, so I substituted half thyme, half sage. I used mild Italian sausage. I was pleased with this dish as it turned out, but next time I would like to use actual savory, and I think I might double the amount of seasoning just to add more zest. I think it might be easier to serve if the sausage had been sliced, or if I'd used those small frozen sausage links instead, so I may try that next time too. This was very easy to make and it would be perfect for a breakfast potluck or to serve for company as something a little special and different.

Sooo good!  I replaced savory with thyme, (didn't have any savory), otherwise followed directions to a T and it was delicious.

I didn't have savoury and only had maple flavoured sausages. So I decided to add a little sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to the batter instead. Smells amazing and tastes like my favourite breakfast treat!!

Mom and I made this for something different for breakfast. We often like to have our main meal in the morning, and this turned out wonderfully.  I have been wanting to try to make "Toad in the hole", for a long time. I am glad that I tried this out. 

We served this with some maple syrup on the side, and it was very yummy. We will definitely make it again.

I had some chicken sausages that needed using up so decided to make this. I didn't have in savory so used sage instead and I added some Parmesan cheese to the batter, but other than that made as is. It's pretty tasty, but I can't taste the sage at all and without the Parmesan I would say this would have been pretty bland. I recommend upping the amount of herbs, adding Parmesan, and using a flavourful sausage to make this a 5* recipe. Will happily make this again with the extra flavour.

The whole family loved this.  I did add more seasonings, like garlic powder and pepper.  Didn't have savory, so used a little sage too.  Older son is already planning on making it in a dutch oven at the next scout camping trip.

This was just really strange.  I was anticipating something like Yorkshire Pudding with sausage but it wasn't.  It has the consistency of a stiff pudding, almost like flan, which was just odd.  The kids didn't like it either until they covered it in syrup.  (Followed directions exactly with no modifications.)

My family liked this recipe.  I made a couple of tweaks by substituting garlic salt for the salt and I added these new bacon flavored french fried onions that I found on my last shopping trip.  I also followed on reviewer's suggestion and served it with brown gravy. Yum!
