Yummy, but needs more flavor. Whatever you season your burgers with would work perfect. Next time, I'm going to add French onion soup mix to the meat mixture.

Decided on this recipe because my family of five are sooo incredibly picky! With very little ingredients and the ease of putting it together it worked out wonderfully. Everyone loved it and even ate leftovers, which never happens! I will make it again for sure. Oh, and for the gluten intolerant folks (my daughter is one) I used brown rice pasta:O)

great recipe. good base. i changed it up a bit. my first post lagged, so i hope I'm not posting twice. 
while browning the meat, i added salt/pepper (bout 1 tsp ea), onion (small, chopped), garlic (3 clove, chopped), chili (about 3tbsp - I like spice!), cumin (bout 2tsp), a pinch of oregeno and a good dust of garlic powder. 
once done I added the tomatoes (2 cans mandatory!), can of corn and mixed it up. 
once warm, i added the cream cheese (1 8oz pkg) and another dusting of chili and cumin. let it heat up, added the macaroni and a smidge more salt/pepper and about a 1/2c of the cheddar. 
keep mixing! 
added the last of the cheddar and popped the lot into the oven for 20min. 
mixed again. its fabulous.  might need a bit more salt/pepper at the table, but its pretty damned good. 
the one thing of cream cheese plenty. i may add a bit more  cheddar, though

I used gluten free pasta.  I added turmeric, oregano, salt and minced onion to the meat.  I used spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes.   I only used one 8 oz cream cheese.  I used 1/2 Colby Jack and 1/2 Mozzerela cheese on top.  .

I added onion and green pepper to the browned meat prior to adding the tomatoes and I only used one package of cream cheese.  My family loved it.
