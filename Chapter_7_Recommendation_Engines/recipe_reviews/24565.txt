These pralines are easy and quick, and the texture is good.  Unfortunately, the evaporated milk scent was so strong that it spoiled the flavor.  Substituting light cream (10% butterfat) would render theses candies perfect.

These were excellent and have gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tried them. I did make a few changes though. The way the recipe is, they come out to be nuts clumps in the midst of a pile of praline "cookie." I prefer the traditionaly southern pralines where it is a nut that is coated in a dry praline coating so I upped the quantity of pecans to 2 cups. I also added 1/4 c. real rum and about a tablespoon of dried ground ginger to the cinnamon/vanilla mixture. For the higher quantity of pecans, you have to move quickly as the praline mixture will cool quickly and begin to solidify around each nut very quickly. Just keep stirring which will break apart huge clusters, then spread on a baking sheet until cool. Then I pour them into a collander and toss all the loose sugar off. This also rounds the edges of the praline coating out on the nuts. Even better is that you can save the sugar that falls out of the collander and use as brown sugar in cookies! So delicious...

This recipe was quick and easy. I  added more pecans and I also used a tablespoon to drop the mixture on a sheet of parchment paper, 1-inch apart instead of spreading on a buttered baking sheet.  My family and I enjoyed it.  You should try it!

Melt-in-your mouth yummy! And so easy to make. I will add more pecans next time.  I will also spread the mixture faster because it firms very quickly.

Very nice recipe, but requires some experience to reach a good outcome. I recommend taking the candy mixture to 240 F. Once you remove it from heat, stir just enough to have the mixture begin to thicken. (DO NOT over-stir at this point or you'll end up with crumbs! Delicious, but not very presentable.) Immediately pour onto a Silpat. Allow to cool completely without disturbing. Then cut or break apart into pieces. I would also increase the amount of pecans to about 2 cups.

My kids are LOVIN' them.  I use 1 1/2 cup white to 1/2 cup brown sugar and right before I stir, just a pinch of salt keeps it from being too sweet!  We also put two large 'dollops' of peanut butter and make them peanut butter pralines!  Yummy...

This recipe is impossible to double---beating at the end is too difficult. The ratio of praline to nuts is high. Next time I would increase the nuts or cut down on the evaporated milk.

This recipe was great!! I have been making pralines for 20 yrs and have always sit and stir and stir so it will get thick. It was so easy this time to use the mixer. Thank you so much.

I have used this recipe for over 30 years. I use a different cooking method, though. I highly recommend a candy thermometer. Cook the sugars and milk on med heat until it reaches 234, stirring often. Add pecans and butter and cook until it reaches 240, stirring about every 60 seconds. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. (Total cook time is about 15 minutes) Let cool until temperature is about 150 degrees. Stir until it begins to hold its shape, but not too stiff. Spoon onto waxed paper and let cool. If mixture becomes too stiff to spoon out, simply reheat it a little.  If you have trouble in higher altitudes, try adding an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. Good luck! They are wonderful!

Wow, these were easier than I thought.  I only made half the recipe to test it. I didn't have a candy thermometer, nor did I do the cold water test.  I just kind of guessed and it came out perfect.  I poured the batch into half a foil lined cake pan to about 1/4 inch thick.  Let it cool, then broke it into pieces.  Will definitely be making this again, and will be making the full amount next time!

Because I was so used to making peanut butter candy, it was really hard to tell when this candy was ready. i was familiar with the whole water dropping thing, but it didn't work out so well. so, i used good judgment and took it out when i thought it was ready.  for this recipe, i think i would have cut back on the pecans.  it seems as though the pecans almost over took the candy.  other than that, the taste was awesome, and i would definitely make it again with fewer pecans. maybe a 1/4 cup less.  anyways, thanks for this recipe. :-)))

Just made these using heavy cream instead of EM, due to what I had on hand fantastic. Second batch already on the stove!!

**UPDATE** Made a double batch to ship out and found that using a cookie scoop to individually drop each one instead of spreading apart and breaking them made them much prettier.

Great, although I should have used halved pecans instead of pieces. I served these on a small dish on the desert bar at my holiday dinner and they were scooped up quick!

These were very easy to make. I tweaked the recipe based on the reviews and they really made the recipe. I used Heavy Cream instead of evaporated milk, upped the pecans to 2 cups, upped the vanilla to 1tsp and added 1/2tsp os sea salt. These tasted just like some pralines I bought in Atlanta. I will be making these for Christmas gifts!

It is a pretty good recipe but I live in New Orleans. I know how awesome pralines taste; and these don't hold a candle to them. It tastes like something is missing or off just a tad. We did enjoy them though.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and will warn you that "Heat without stirring (over medium heat) . . ." will leave a burned layer on the bottom of your pan! I did use dark brown sugar as the recipe didn't specify between dark or light brown. These came out chewy rather than "first bite crispy then melt in your mouth" that I'm used to. If I still can't find my lost "go to" recipe and make this again, next time I'll use light brown sugar and give it an occasional stir until soft ball stage reached.  The amount of pecans seemed just fine; it's just a matter of preference.  Update 12/21/17 Didn't realize I made this before! Results were same disappointment. Chewy  and dark (didn't use the light brown sugar).

Love!  I had pawlines about 30yrs ago for the first time.  My mother-in-law made them for me.  I have been searching for the right recipe ever since!  I don't know if this is the exact recipe but it tastes just as yummy!  Friends and family rejoice!!

The recipe is flawless. However, any True Southerner would have you arrested by the Praline Police for cutting them with a knife instead of dropping them by spoonfuls onto the parchment paper.

Turned out well.  Made half the amount and used whipping cream instead of Carnation milk.  Added 1 cup of pecans.  Never make candy so ended up with hardball stage, but it was delicious.

I had to make it twice as first batch hardened/cooled/crystallized too fast. Tasted good, but consistency was wrong. So second batch I had electric mixer ready to go, only cooled 4 minutes, and worked really fast.

I loved the flavor, but not enough pecans. Next time I make this, I'll have to add more. Maybe 2 cups instead of the 1 1/4 the original recipe calls for. Other than that, they were delicious!

Very good! Made it the way the recipe calls exactly. I am from New Orleans and we know pralines.

I added 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla vs. 1/4 teaspoon.  These turned out wonderfully both in taste and look.

didn't make any changes, didn't seem to need anything else.  Might have added a few more pecans than recipe called for but that is it.

It taste so good. I started off making candied pecans but thought about pralines. I didn't have brown or  vanilla, but it taste wonder without it. Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent recipe and so-very-easy. I decided to try a vegan (non-dairy) version using "So Delicious" brand unsweetened coconut beverage (not to be confused with the culinary coconut milk in the can) plus vegan butter, and it came out wonderful. I also found that this recipe can be made as a half-batch. I am very happy to have found this. It tastes very  much like the penuche fudge that my mother used to make for us back in the wonder years, so the nostalgia factor makes it especially sweet.

I've been cooking for family and friends for years, who've been begging me to make them pralines.  I don't much care for them but, they're kinda a favorite down here where I live.  
I used this recipe, removed from heat too soon had to scratch and remake.  
According  to everyone so far, they taste just exactly as gramma used to make. The demands are endless.  
I did add 1/2 cup more pecan halves,  1/2 teaspoon of salt (to the sugars and milk before heating) and substituted the vanilla for 1&1/2 tblsp of spiced rum. 
Yup, these, my friends (and according to my friends) are to die for. 
;-)

Excellent recipe!!! Evaporated milk is what makes pecan candy/pralines taste so great. I like making it with this recipe  with and without the pecans when I run out of pecans. I also use a skillet sometimes. I would not use a stainless steel bottom but that is just my opinion. Also dropping them on a plastic tray and using a spatula works just fine.

I used this recipe for my cashew praline. I also added a little bit of white chocolate and more vanilla. There is no need to put nuts into the caramel. I put a layer of nuts on a parchment paper and coat with hot caramel.  Easy!

I made it just as the recipe was written but after the five minutes off the stove rest time mine were still a little runny so I stirred the mixture til it thickened.  This recipe made about nine delicious pralines.

These are amazing, I have made them 3 times, each time following the cooking directions as written. The only change i make is that I use an ice cream scoop to make individual pralines sometimes on a baking sheet and sometimes in the muffin tin. These are excellent and super easy!

This was very good and easy. The only change I made was I added 2 cups of whole pecans. Next time I will add 1/2 cup more.
