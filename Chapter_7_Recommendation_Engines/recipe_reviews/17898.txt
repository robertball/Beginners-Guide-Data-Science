Not exactly home baking quality, particularly since every aspect of this involves highly processed foods, but good and quick in a pinch. Since I sent it to work with hubs for his staff and knew he wouldn't want the hassle of a trifle bowl, I just baked the brownies in an 11x7 dish, then layered on the pudding, whipped topping and crushed cookies. Easy to serve.

I made the other one with the sweetened condensed milk added and it was too sweet! So I figured I wanted to make it this way and looked for a recipe like what i had in mind. This way is tons better. This recipe is only to be made hours prior to eating, don't make it and then carry somewhere the next day it will be soggy. I made it about 5 hours prior to a church potluck and it was great but i could tell it wouldn't be good long after. Made to be eaten soon after.

I have been making this dessert for years, we call it "The Chocolate Bomb."  I don't use the sandwich cookies, but sometimes chop up candy bars such as twix, snickers, etc and sprinkle on top.  I also always use sugar free, fat free pudding and fat free Cool Whip and no one ever knows the difference.  Tastes great and makes a great presentation.

Yummy! I made this dessert for a BBQ and it was a huge success. I did substitute the cookies for chocolate chips, but simply due to personal preferance. Definitely a keeper!

THIS IS SOOOO GOOD. I'VE MADE THIS BEFORE WITHOUT THE BROWNIES AND IT WAS STILL DELICIOUS. MAKE SURE TO LEAVE THE COOL WHIP OUT OF THE FRIDGE UNTIL IT IS SOFT WHILE YOU MAKE THE BROWNIES.

This is almost the same as the Chocolate Trifle recipe. The only difference I add is 2 tbsp instant coffee to the chocolate pudding as it's being mixed, to make it more like a mocha trifle. If you let it sit overnight, it's even better.

Excellent recipe.  I have the same one at home only I used package chocolate cake mix instead of Brownie mix and I crush up kit kat bars on top instead of cookies.  Very Yummy.  :)  Enjoy!!  :)

Five stars for simplicity while still being super delicious! I omitted the oreo cookies and instead topped this with Reeses peanut butter cups. I also put this in a 9x13 pan as it wasn't going to fit well in my trifle dish. I also used two 3.9 oz. boxes of chocolate pudding and one 8 oz. container of cool whip was plenty.

Ohhh so sweet! The ONLY problem with this, is trying not to eat it all and trying not to eat all the brownies when you are placing them in the pan! This is so easy to make and will feed a lot of people. If I change anything in the future, I will top it with toffee instead of oreos....the oreos got a little soggy (I didn't crush them up though, I just placed the whole cookies on top).

This is really easy to make, and tastes great...but not so great after a day or two in the fridge.  The ingredients start to mush together and we end up tossing at least 1/4 of it because we never can eat it all in time.  This would be a great dish to take to a large potluck or picnic.  Any place you can be sure it will be eaten on the first day!

Very good recipe except if I were to make it again, I'd make it with a double batch of fudge brownies. It didn't fill up my trifle dish as much as I would like. Instead of chocolate pudding I bought Oreo pudding and I put Scor bits in between layers. Ontop I put scor bits and mini oreos for a nicer presentation.

My sister made this using her own homemade brownie recipe for my mother's 80th birthday party, and it was the first thing to disappear. It's a great party recipe.

This is a very easy and tasty dessert.  Everyone in my office loved it!  I've made it twice once using a trifle bowl and the other a large bowl.  My advice is to use a trifle bowl for the best presentation.  Tasted the same though!

This recipe was so simple and delicious. I ended up whipping the cream myself and then tweaked it for a Christmas party and added peppermint extract. Definitely going into my recipe box!

Recipe is great but you need to TRIPLE the amount of ingredients needed if you want your dessert to look like the picture.  I used two tubs of cool whip, 1 5.9 oz box of jello and another smaller box of jello.  I made my own brownies in a 9X11 pan but could have used more.  If you want a full dessert then triple the recipe and you'll have enough!!  I didn't have any cookies so I used chocolate chips on top.  I could have used extra brownies if I had them.
