First, the one thing that I didn't like about this is the dryness.  It took longer to cook than 40 minutes, and I added some water to the casserole dish three times.  I suppose adding real sugar would have resulted in the sugar melting into a syrup which the Truvia doesn't do.  However, the thing I did like is the taste; true apple flavor with no sugar substitute aftertaste.  Not my favorite apple crisp, but it was pretty good.
