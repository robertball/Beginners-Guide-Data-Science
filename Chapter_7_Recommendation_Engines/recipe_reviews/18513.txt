I use the same recipe for the coconut tart, but have used a variety of different fillings.  Chocolate "ganache" - 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 TB of milk, melt in microwave (30-60 seconds more or less, stirring frequently) and then stir until smooth.  I do this in a Pyrex glass measuring cup and then just pour the chocolate filling into the tart cups.  I sprinkle a little coconut on top (which I sometimes color with food coloring- like red, white and blue for 4th of July or red and green for Christmas) OR put a raspberry on top OR a little crushed almonds on top for an Almond Joy flavor.  Lemon curd - just dollop lemon curd in the tart shell and top with a raspberry and then sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Chocolate Cheesecake - just dollop refrigerated ready-made cheesecake filling into the tart shell and top with chocolate ganache.  Raspberry cheesecake - put a small dollop of raspberry jelly in the tart and top with ready-made cheesecake filling and top with a raspberry and /or a little chocolate ganache.  Really, the combinations are endless.  I personally don't think pudding and cool whip sound very appetizing for these delicious tart shells.

This was the hit of the shower I threw this past weekend! I made the macaroons a day in advance, substituted lemon curd for the pudding and piped real whipped cream on top with a snipped sandwich bag. Heavenly!

A nice fresh tasting summertime treat.  To get a more intense lemon flavor I added lemon zest (the yellow peel from a fresh lemon)to the pudding mixture and topped the Cool Whip with coconut and lemon zest for added taste and presentation.

Made these for my brother's wedding reception, and they were great!  Very easy yet elegant.  Next time I will splurge on time or money and either buy or make my own lemon curd - instant lemon pudding just doesn't have the intense lemon flavor I was hoping for.  Or maybe I'll just replace some milk with lemon juice when I make the pudding...either way, will certainly make again.  Thanks Andrea!

These look professionally made, and someone said they were the best things he'd ever tasted. Keep an eye on the macaroon shells when baking.

These were extremely easy to make.  You just have to make sure they are pressed into the muffin cups evenly, to make sure there's enough of a hole for the filling.  If you make the "walls" of the cup too thick, they will be too chewy (the ones I made with thinner "walls" tasted better).  I filled these with lemon curd and topped with fresh sweetened whipped cream.  My guests really enjoyed these.

Very very good. I didn't have a 24 mini muffin pan, mine was only 18 so they were a little full (I had to scoop out the middle to make room for filling). If you only have 18 either multiply the recipe by 1.5 and do two pans worth or save some batter and do a second batch of another half (fill the remaining cups w/ some water). I also found this incredibly sticky and I couldn't use my fingers. I sprayed the back of a measuring spoon for every cup w/ cooking spray. This was a bit of effort, but pretty darn tasty, especially to the coconut lovers in my family. I filled them with the lemon curd from this site (amazing).

Not quite as lemony as I was hoping. Not one of those "can't-stop-eating-'em" desserts but quite good nonetheless. Next time I think I'll try white chocolate or regular chocolate pudding instead---I think they'd be a nice option in the macaroon "shells."

These tartlets are very tasty, but a agree with another reviewer that they were a challenge to remove from the pan, even when only cooled for the two minutes recommended.  Also, a baking time would have been helpful.  I checked them in five minute intervals and it took 10-15 minutes to get the browned edges stated in the recipe.  I also filled them with a homemade vanilla custard and topped them with real whipped cream (not being a fan of lemon desserts or whipped topping).  All in all a good recipe.  Might try the chocolate others stated next time.

These were a HIT! I made them onNational macaroon day. I used Banna Cream Pudding instead and I while baking I put in the shells a few Chocolate chips. When they came out of the oven I spead the chips into the cups with a small spoon. So good! Little Bannana Cream Pies!

These were good. The edges were burning while the insides were still bubbly. :-( I have only a 12 mini muffin pan so I practically burned the first batch. The second batch was better. I used lemon curd and cool whip for the top. These are really pretty but, a lot of work. I'm glad I made them. Hubby thought they were good. And, anything with coconut and lemon is a hit in my book :-)

Tasted very good, but annoyed that the recipe did not specifiy a baking time.  As other reviewers have mentioned, these are excellent with the Lemon Curd by Margaret B instead of pudding.

Yum! A little putzy getting the tins filled and pressed in, but it was worth it. So yummy! Perfectly sweet, wonderfully chewy, delicious. I made "Microwave Lemon Curd" to fill these tart shells and couldn't be more pleased! Pop one in your mouth and it's like magic! I'd serve with a dollop of whipped cream if I was serving to guests but skipped that step this time around. Wow... wondering what else I can fill the shells with... =)

Great tartlet shells!  I used Trader Joe's lemon curd as a filling, and they were really delicious.  Obviously you could use any cooked filling you like - mix it up and serve them on a platter - very pretty, too.

What a disaster this turned out to be. I followed the recipe for the macaroon part exactly (3/8 c of flour is a weird measurement, I wasnt quite sure how to measure it, maybe that's what went wrong). They did not bake into cups at all, they puffed up and filled the whole mini muffin tin, they would not come out of the pan and the texture/flavor was strange, luckily I had tried only a few the first time because the recipe did not say how long to bake them. I tried a few more with less of the macaroon mixture and used mini muffin papers, but they were still not right. Luckily I hadnt started the filling. This was a very disappointing recipe.

I added 1 tsp of Lemon EXTRACT (not juice) to pump up the tanginess. This was perfect after a heavier dinner and easy to make.  Everyone loved them.  Thank you for a great recipe.

These were really good and have a good presentation.  I made chocolate pudding instead of lemon.  If I make these again, however, I will find a filling other than pudding.  It just didn't seem to have the right texture or flavor as a filling for these.  I like the idea of a lemon curd or maybe a chocolate mousse

Absolutely great when using Margaret's lemon curd recipe from this site, & fresh whipped cream on top. I took them to a bbq & they were gone before we had even started grilling! Next time I make them though, I will probably use a little less coconut & a little more flour as the crust was slightly more chewy then I wanted it.

Lovely! Nice different kind of crust, I did add some of the egg yolk because my mixture was too dry - I would say to use large eggs for the egg whites.  I filled these with lemon curd - they were a winner with my hubby!!

Very yummy!  I got rave reviews for these tasty treats!!  (I added a little lemon juice when making the pudding and used whipping cream w/ powdered sugar instead of frozen whipped topping.)  My only complaint: it was extremely hard to get the macaroon "cups" out of the muffin pan -- even though I had greased the pan and only let them cool 2 minutes.  So now I make little wax-paper squares to line the bottom of the muffin cups (like I would for a cake) and that makes life much easier!

Pushing the coconut in the muffin cups was a real pain and you must get it thin enough, read other reviews that warn you too thick is gooey not crunchy. Skip the pudding and use microwave lemon curd as found in allrecipes and also recommended by another reviewer. Can top as stated or with a raspberry and powdered sugar on top.

I had success with these.  I did notice that you really need to squish the mixture down into the tartlet cups. They puffed a little and the cups weren't as deep (or cooked) as I would've liked.  Next time I'll use less coconut mixture per tartlet cup.  I also used a chocolate mousse recipe from this site for the filling and sprinkled toasted sliced almonds on most of them.  They were excellent!

Wow this was soo good! I never bake but this recipe was so quick and easy.  The only addition I made was adding lemon zest and freshly squeezed lemon juice to the pudding to give it an extra lemony kick.  The presentation is great too - my food never looks as good as it tastes but this definitley does.  Great recipe for parties, I'll definitley be making this treat again!

To get a more lemony taste, use lemon juice instead of milk in the pudding mix.

This recipe looked great, but the macaroon recipe looked too sweet to me, so I modified it by using icing sugar and unsweetened coconut to balance the flavours.  I brought this into work.  My workplace is 90% women and they're hard to please but this was a HIT!

i gave this 3 stars because even though the crust is really good, i think it would be better as macaroon cookies rather than a crust. As a crust it was too chewy and crisp on the edges.For the filling  i added a cream cheese layer. I mixed cream cheese and cool whip together (about 8oz cream cheese and 2 cups cool whip).I filled the cups with a spoonful of the cream cheese mix and the lemon pudding on top. the filling came out great but lemon curd would probably have been better than the pudding.

These were ok.  I wanted a dessert serving and used a full sized muffin tin, but they would be better kept as bite size. I tried lemon pudding, lemon curd, a mixture of both, and some with a little melted chocolate inside the cups.  The lemon pudding ones were boring at best, the lemon curd ones were pretty good, and the chocolate ones just tasted like chocolate.  The cups want to fill in while cooking so you have to press them again just after cooking to re-create a bowl.  Like someone else said...ok, but just not a "can't stop eating" kind of dessert.
