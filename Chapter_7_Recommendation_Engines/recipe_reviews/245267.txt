I will certainly make this again, but with more sweet potato. I used cauliflower since I had no broccoli, and would also increase the amount next time. I may omit the pepper all together next time, as I don't think it complimented the meal.  The "dressing" was perfect.

I just added a fourth star to my rating. At first, the flavor of the sweetness and the lime with the vegetables didn't really work for me, but adding some dry roasted almonds balanced the sweetness for me and turned it into a really delicious dish.

This was so colorful and something different as a side. The roasted sweet potatoes were a nice addition. I made as the recipe lists, however there was alot of quinoa. I started with one cup of dry quinoa but I think you could scale back to about 3/4 cup. Will make again!

Having recently adopted a vegetarian diet, this recipe has perfect ingredients and it is a  “keeper”.  It is delicious and easy to prepare.  I use All Recipes often to find vegetarian recipes.

We skipped the dressing altogether.  As for the broccoli and peppers, we blanched them due to the water quality where we live and that worked fine.  Even with those changes, it turned out wonderful.  I don't know if we'll make it again as the main goal was to teach the young woman who lives with me about cooking with quinoa, but as it made a pleasant, healthy salad, we just might.

Substituted honey instead of the maple syrup. It was delicious, but lacked something. I added sliced green onion, but purple onion would be delicious as well. This worked excellently with honey glazed chicken.

This recipe is a keeper!  Delicious and vegan!  I used 2 large sweet potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and a cup of cooked garbanzo beans. To the dressing I added cayenne and juice of 3/4 of fresh lime and lemon.

Delicious when freshly made! OK as leftovers on day 1 and not great as leftovers on day 2. The serving says for 4 and it was much more plentiful than that!

Loved it! I swapped out the broccoli for roasted beets. The vinaigrette  was perfect. Brightened up this salad. I also topped with a few feta crumbles to add protein and make it more of an entree.

We love this salad. The only change I made was to reduce the quinoa to 3/4 cup. I didn't have a cucumber but think that will add to the flavors.  This will be a go to recipe!

Only 4 stars for when I made it according to the recipe. Five stars when I added fresh sliced pineapple!!! The pineapple adds sweetness it required for my palette.

I really liked this recipe hot as well. To do it hot, I omitted the cucumber and replaced it with black beans. I either roasted it sauteed the other vegetables. I added broccoli and zucchini as well, but only because I had it on hand. Thanks for this lovely vegetarian meal or salad!

A gorgeous looking dish and it tastes great also. It was much more flavorful than I expected. All those fresh veggies give it a great flavor! I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the potatoes for an added touch. I also added some celery to the mix just to use it up. The dressing was a good touch also but I would eat it even without the dressing.

Next time I would use a better olive oil that isn't overpowering. I made it last night and it was delicious. I let everyone apply the dressing separately. I had the leftovers today for lunch and the salad tasted even better.

I made this exactly as written but didn't have cilantro for garnish so left that out. I think the bell peppers are a little overpowering. If I make again I will use less bell pepper or maybe substitute another vegetable like squash and red onion. The dressing was good but not a fan of maple syrup. Might try with honey instead as a couple of other reviewers suggested.
