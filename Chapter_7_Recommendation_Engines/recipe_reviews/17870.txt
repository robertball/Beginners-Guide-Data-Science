Cooking chicken covered with oil and soy sauce is my favorite way to eat chicken... the soy sauce gives it good flavor and the oil keeps it moist.  I had never thought to do it with a roasted chicken, however, until I read this recipe and thought, "why not?"  I followed the recipe loosly:  I made a mixture of chopped onions, chopped garlic, sage, ginger, a little bit of soy sauce, a little sesame seed oil and a little broth and put that inside the chicken.  I then covered the chicken with the sesame oil first and then soy sauce (not the oil at the end like the recipe, which makes no sense to me... the oil keeps the chicken moist), added about a cup or so of broth to the pan and let it cook... I did cook it for a half hour at 400 and then for another hour and a half at 350.  I made gravy with the drippings/broth mixture, which ended up being the BEST gravy to ever come out of my kitchen, but I didn't use this recipe for the gravy... I made it with flour (actually Wondra) and the pan stuff only.   The chicken smelled GREAT the whole time it cooked, and looked awesome... the oil/soy sauce made the skin beatifully brown and crispy, the inside was SO moist.  The gravy, like I said, was to DIE FOR (served it over the chix and white rice).  This meal was really awesome.

Scrumptious!! I made the following modifications after reading the reviews: I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 C and the sesame oil to 1/4 C, I also added 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper and 1/4 each garlic powder and ground ginger to the soy sauce before brushing it onto the chicken. I added about 1/2 C of chicken broth to the pan to prevent the burnt taste that several others have complained about. My bird came out perfectly cooked and beautifully browned, and the gravy is heavenly! I would recommend the leftovers for a Chinese chicken salad... would've tried it myself but we had none! I do have lots of leftover gravy as the kids weren't interested in it, so I think next week I will brush the gravy over chicken breasts and oven bake them. Thanks for the recipe Lisamarie, it's definitely a keeper!! P.S. Serve it over Egg Fried Rice by Krista B from this site... you will be glad you did!

This chicken, along with the gravy, served with steamed white rice and green beans, made a delicious and easy Sunday dinner for my family. I used other reviewers' suggestions and stuffed the chicken with chopped onion, garlic and ginger, moistened with a little soy and sesame oil. Next time I'll try stuffing this mixture until the skin of the breast as well. I rubbed the outside of the bird with the sesame oil first, then brushed on low sodium soy sauce. I poured one cup of chicken stock (not broth, which has higher sodium) in the bottom of the roasting pan, set the bird down into the pan, and roasted it at 400 for 1/2 hr. Then lowered the heat to 350 and let it cook for 1 1/2 hrs. The gravy (thickened with 2T. cornstarch mixed with a little water) was perfect, no need for any  add'l salt or pepper. Thanks so much for a great recipe I'll use over and over!

Well Lisamarie, my family loved this simple and different roasted chicken. To cut back on the salt, I used both low sodium soy sauce and chicken broth and to add more flavor, I seasoned my bird with onion and garlic powders, black pepper and a bit of ginger. To those who had a problem with the soy sauce burning on the bottom of the pan, all you need to do is pour in a little chicken stock and it will be fine. Delicious!

the gravy does NOT turn out the way it should.  It burns at the bottom of the pan and the gravy has a salty/burnt taste.

This was sooooo good.  I was amazed at how great it tasted with such simple ingredients.  The leftovers were great, too- I stir fried some broccoli and green onions then tossed in the chicken I'd taken off the bone then added the leftover rice and sauce.  Yum.

A very, very nice and different way to get fantastic flavour into a roast chicken! Made a couple of tweaks, and with these adaptions it is a 5 star recipe no question. I added some diced white onion and crushed garlic cloves to the roasting pan. I also added 1/2 tsp of toasted sesame oil in right at the end before serving. Scumptious!!

I thought it might turn out too salty, but it didn't.  I did make a point of basting the chicken as it roasted.

I was skeptical to try this mostly because I thought the soy sauce would never hold up to the heat - I was right.  Burned soy sauce. Boring chicken. No gravy. Bummer dinner. Sorry.

The flavour of the chicken is great!  I used low sodium soya and chicken broth and the gravy was still a bit too salty for my taste but you don't need much.  Also found that I only needed 1/2 c of soy and about 1/4 c of sesame oil.  Will make again.

We will definitely make this chicken again!!  AWESOME!!  I used a whole onion and stalk of celery with minced ginger in cavity.  Slathered oil then soy sauce. Added 1 cup orange juice to roasting pan.  Baked breast down for one hour and breast up for rest.  Gravy:  2 cups chicken stock added to pan drippings and cornstarch diluted in water to thicken.  Best gravy I ever ate. (and made)

I used two chicken quarters and reduced the soy sauce & sesame oil since it wasn't a whole chicken.  The whole house smelled wonderful and the flavor of the chicken was great. The gravy itself did turn out quite salty (it IS soy sauce after all!) but I treated it kind of like an au jus just dipping a little at a time.  All in all a great and simple flavorful recipe! Thank you.

I tried this with chicken legs because that's what I had on hand.  They turned out so moist and delicious!  I was amazed that so few ingredients could produce something so good.  Basted with soy first, 400 degree oven, turned halfway through and basted with more soy and then sesame oil.  Total cooking time was about 40 minutes.  I did add a little chicken stock to the pan while baking to prevent the soy from burning.  The pan sauce was very salty so I added about a Tbsp of sour cream and it was amazingly yummy over rice.  No need to thicken with cornstarch.  This recipe is a definite keeper and probably my new go-to when I need some chicken for a sandwich or salad.  I think next time I'll try split chicken breast or maybe a cornish game hen!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Simple and extremely satisfying. The chicken was so tasty that we barely used any gravy! I did add a cup of chicken stock while baking chicken to avoid burning and a 1/2 onion, quartered in the cavity. Awesome flavor.

This is an excellent recipe, I did read the other reviews and took some of their advice. I rubbed the chicken with the sesame oil, then poured on the soya sauce. The gravy was excellent as well. I did use canned chicken stock. I will definitely make this recipe again, and again, and again. Tanks for sharing!!!

This is a yummy recipe! Yes, the sauce tastes salty straight out of the pan, but over rice it's wonderful. Low sodium soy or using half soy sauce and half water might also work. The leftover sauce is great in stir fries, etc. Simple and very good.

My kids loved this especially the gravy. They generally don’t like gravy. The chicken had just enough seasoning although I used low sodium soy. The oil really helps the skin become crisp. Great recipe.

I've read some reviews that say that the drippings get burnt. Put the chicken on a bed of mirepoix (relitively the same sized cuts of onions, carots, celery) about a cup will do. This keeps the bottom from getting burnt because it is not on the pan and achieves a more even level of doneness. It also makes more juice for a sauce and makes it a bit sweeter.

I make this all the time now because it always comes out moist and delicious.  It's like brining the bird without all the trouble!  I do put a cup of water or broth in the pan to prevent burning of the juices.  I 'paint' on the soy and sesame oil, add the broth and roast at 400 the entire time.  Takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes to get the internal temp to 170.  I make at least 2 chickens at a time.  My favorite thing at the moment is to make this recipe just using chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I do everything the same, except just half a cup or so water, enough to cover the bottom of the pan by about a quarter inch. Then bake at 400. It takes about 40 minutes for the biggest breasts to cook to 170, but less time for smaller ones that are sometimes in the same package.  I just start checking around 35 minutes.  Extremely yummy moist chicken.  Thanks so much for the jumping off point!

This has been one of our favorites.  I use low sodium soy sauce and instead of chicken broth for the gravy, I use the drippings from the chicken.  1 tablespoon of cornstarch to each cup of liquid.

Incredibly easy and good. Like others, I put the chicken broth in the bottom of the pan and basted throughout. No burning, just good flavor, and I didn't even spice it up with garlic or ginger. 

I had far less seseme oil than the recipe called for, but it still turned out well. I used about 1/2 c low-sodium tamari and about 1/3 c broth. Served with baked squash and a salad with rice vinegar/soy dressing. Didn't try the gravy.

We'll definately make again... my husband liked it very much!

I'm going to be honest.  The chicken tasted great!  But that gravy is the worst food item i've ever tasted!!  It is way to salty!!  I'll make the chicken again, but will leave out the gravy.

The chicken turned out great! However, I sliced pats of butter and stuffed it between the skin and meat to insure that the chicken would be juicy. It's great!

Very good.  I only used ~1T of oil...cannot stand an oil slick.  I shredded the chicken in the "gravy" and served over rice.  Everyone liked it.

This chicken was so excellent.  My whole family loved it.  I did change the recipe - I used Aminos (low-sodium soy substitute) instead of soy, and I added ginger and garlic powder and seseme oil to the rub.  I still added the oil in the last ten minutes.  And it was delicious.

I made this recipe on Wednesday for my family.  All of us had several helpings so much so that there were no leftovers.  I did as someone else did and rubbed the chicken with the sesame oil before pouring the soy sauce over it.  It turned out really great.  I also made the gravy and some rice.  What an excellent recipe!

Love it! I've made it twice and I'm in the process of making it a third time. I put the sesame oil on the chicken first then the soya sauce. I make sure that I baste it every 15 mins. Add chicken broth to the pan when cooking, it will prevent the soya sauce from burning.   So good on egg fried rice!

This is so good.  I've made it several times and OMG, I've never made a better roast chicken!  I did rub the chicken first with the sesame oil and then poured the soy sauce over it.  I roasted it in a pan with a lid and that meant that the soy sauce didn't dry up.  Usually I would add a cup of chicken stock, but I didn't this time and this worked perfect for the gravy.  This was so good!

This is great!  Changes...used 1/2 cup reduced soy sauce, added 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp salt to soy sauce, rubbed chicken with oil (under skin too)before I poured soy mixture over it, stuffed chicken with cut onions and garlic, poured chicken stock around bottom of chicken to bake, and used a 6 lb bid so increased cook time to total of 2 hours.  I also didn't make the gravy.  The skin was the best part! Man, the leftovers were incredible, too.  Used them for chicken and noodles and it was way better than usual.  A really easy recipe and wonderful results!  Thanks!

Easy.  The chicken did not absorp as much flavor as I thought it would.  I would pass on the gravy in the future - too salty and wasn't really used much.  Of course, maybe with the gravy on the chicken I would not have noticed that the chicken wasn't as flavorful as expected.  Maybe putting half the soy between skin and chicken and the rest on the skin?

This recipie is excellent and easy!  I don't usually ever mess with the gravy; we just dip the chicken in the "sauce".  This is one of my hubby's favorites.  It can be a little salty, so if you don't like too much salt you may want low-sodium soy sauce...mmmm, excellent!!

The chicken was WONDERFUL!!  Very tasty and extremely juice.  I didn't find a need for the gravy since the chicken was so good by itself.  Also the gravy was very strong.

I'm sorry to rate this a one, but it really didn't turn out good at all.  The major flavor, at least on the skin/drippings, was burnt soy sauce.  I tried the suggestion of adding a can of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan, it still cooked dry and burned, even after adding a second can.

I made this today except I didn't bake the chicken-I boiled it. I never thought Abt adding sesame oil to the water used to boil chicken till I saw this recipe-it gave me the idea. I rinsed the whole chicken, covered it in sesame oil, & put it in a medium sized soup pan almost halfway filled with water. I rinsed all th livers, gizzards, chicken heart in the packet & threw it all in the pot. Afterwards, I poured more sesame oil and couple splashes of low sodium soy sauce into the water. I also peeled some carrots and threw it in there whole. I simmered the chicken (covered) on medium low heat for abt 1hr. I turned the chicken over midway (after 30min). I had to add a little more sea salt after the chicken was cooked but overall, The chicken was so tender and this recipe made such a delicious tasting delicate broth! I'm mostly using this chicken to put on salad (shredding it to little chunks once it cools) so it turned out ok. But The broth is tastey! I didn't want to throw it away. I poured it over some hot rice and ate that with the chicken livers (best part) & boiled carrots. Mm mm good! I didn't need to use any of the cornstarch with my method and the kitchen smelled so good while it was cooking. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Turned out great: tasty and moist. Other complained about saltiness, but we did not find that to be so. The taste was a good balance. I followed another review and added chopped onion and minced garlic. Also, basted the chicken a couple times during the bake-time. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was awesome. Next time I wouldn't measure out the oil and soy, even with the reduced amounts some have suggested. Pouring enough to coat the chicken generously is fine and you won't waste expensive sesame oil. I coated with oil first, as someone suggested, then soy. I then poured maybe 1/2 cup water in the pan to prevent burning. Skin side down first to absorb flavor, then flip to skin side up to crisp. It was SO moist, delicious, and unique. Sesame oil brings the true taste of Chinese cooking. Do not substitute.

Great chicken! Everyone diverts from the original, as did I. But the Skin comes out nice and crispy with the sesame oil, and very tasty overall. A great simple recipe, just the way I like them!

Yum, yum!  I made this last night for dinner and it was sooooo easy!!!  It was moist and delicious - my whole family loved it!  When I noticed the soy sauce starting to burn a bit on the bottom of the pan I just added a bit more chicken stock.  The gravy was delicious, but a bit salty  Be sure to use low-sodium chicken stock and soy sauce (I only had regular soy). Thanks for a great recipe - will make again!!!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I followed the advise of a reviewer and added the oil during cooking along with the chicken broth - turned out wonderfully. Very moist and the gravy was fantastic. I found it a little on the salty side even with reduced sodium soy sauce so next time I will use a little less and replace with a little more chicken broth.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because my kids didn't like the gravy. The chicken was awesome, tender and juicy. Next time will skip the gravy and just serve the chicken to my family.

We loved this.  I changed the recipe based on some of the other reviews and stuffed the chicken with chopped onion, garlic, celery and some grated fresh ginger.  Basted the chicken with the sesame oil and then with some low sodium soy sauce.  I kept basting it throughout the cooking time (30 mins at 400 and then 1hr 30 mins at 350).  I only used about 1/3 cup soy sauce, since we do not like salty food.  I added 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup orange juice to the roasting pan at the beginning of the cooking time.  When the chicken was cooked, I carved it and placed it in a seperate serving dish and removed the stuffing from the carcass and added it to the sauce in the pan.  I did not make the gravy with the cornstarch since the sauce was thick enough and really tasty.  I served it with brown basmati rice and it was truly wonderful.

One of the worst things I've tried. 3/4 cup is way too much soy sauce. It dripped into the bottom of the pan and burned. The chicken didn't have much flavor either. Maybe with less soy sauce it would be better.

I poured the soy over the chicken, then covered with enough sesame oil to moisten. The gravy was wonderfully thick after time, but extremely salty. We'll make it again, maybe with less soy to decrease salt.

It's not fancy, but if you're looking for something simple, inexpensive, yet tasty this is it. I thought the gravy would be too salty, but it's just right over rice. Next time I might stuff cavity w/ onion & herbs for a more flavorful chicken.

Wonderful! Now one of my favorites. The lovely smell lingers for a couple days in the house so if you do not like that, beware! Make sure and use a nonstick pan and I added water to the pan as the burning (carmelizing) soy sauce made me uneasy.  Just adjust the water added to the chicken stock at the end, but even if there is too much water in the pan, you can just boil it off anyway.

5 4 18 ...'One heck of an easy & delicious recipe!  Yes, I changed measurements because it seemed obvious to me that listed amounts were off.  Using a pastry brush for the soy sauce & oil, most will run down to the pan, which is fine, but there's the salty problem identified.  I put two whole chickens in a roasting pan & brushed on 2/3c soy - for both - & the gravy was still salty; not that we didn't enjoy it, mind you.  I put a small amount of water in the pan before baking.  Basted occasionally.  Sesame oil is expensive.  A quarter cup was plenty to brush on.  When it came time to remove the chickens, there were two cups of liquid in the pan.  Okay, two & a quarter cups.  I skimmed off that oily fat layer.  No browned bits n the pan.   Since I had m'two cups, one cup per, I put the broth I thawed back in refrig..  'Not enough cornstarch so used 1/4c flour to thicken in a quart pot.  This recipe would be a big confidence builder for a beginner: easy, easy, easy & good.   Oh, I put half an onion inside each chicken.  I was feelin' wild.  ; )

I made this with the Egg Fried Rice. The chicken was very tasty. Tender and juicy. The gravy is "sneaky good". When I tasted it by itself it seemed too salty, but when applied lightly to a slice of white meat it was pure joy! Easy does it on the gravy - FIVE STARS!

Great versatile recipe. Due to diet restrictions I have never made the gravy. I just thicken the pan juice and it is very tasty.
I have made the recipe as is (no gravy) and I have kicked it up with hot sauce and sweetened with honey. I have also used just skinless breasts
Simple cooking is my style and this recipe suits my family just fine.
The leftovers are great cold on a garden salad.

Great recipe! Like most people I took other ideas and added my own. I stuffed the cavity with 1 chopped bundle of scallions, soy, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, sage and chicken broth. I am really bad at measuring any of these. I taste before I put into chicken. Added a little pepper. Placed chicken on a rack breast side down in a roasting pan. Rubbed sesame oil on chicken then the low sodium soy sauce. First half hour at 400 then dropped down to 350 for about an hour. Placed under broiler just to get a nice crunchy skin then flipped breast side up and repeated.   As for the sauce I melted butter in a pan and used 2 different Japanese and Chinese mushrooms to saute. When nice and tender I added flour and cooked it down a little. Then I take all the juices from the bottom of the pan which there was plenty!  Gravy with the mushrooms and all the amazing flavors were amazing! My 21 yr old son who hates mushrooms loved it! I served with white sticky rice no vegetable needed.

I have made this recipe multiple times and with minor modifications have absolutely loved it.  I use low sodium soy sauce and chicken stock.  But it is fabulous.  The next day i shred the chicken and serve it with the leftover rice, green onion and hard boiled eggs.  That is IF there are any leftovers which is pretty rare.  Great recipe.  Simple and delicious.

This was crazy-salty and I don't think I'd make it again.  It was pretty, as far as presentation, but even though I used reduced-sodium soy sauce, I still found it really salty.  When there are so many nice roast chicken recipes, I don't think I'd use this one to fall back on.

This recipe was wonderful!  I followed the suggestions and zipped up the soy sauce with some ginger, garlic, and black pepper.  I added chicken stock to the bottom of the pan and basted frequently.  I only cooked for about an hour and 10 min (could have gone a little longer), and I threw some broccoli in the pan during the last 20 min for a side.  Next time I'll use less sesame oil.  We served with white rice to help even out the salty taste.  The chicken was wonderful and we didn't even need the gravy!

This recipe was certainly easy to do. It seemed to cook a bit faster than I anticipated but I caught it in time so it was still very tender. I must have put too much chicken broth in the pan early on because when I tried to make the gravy it didn't thicken up well, but it was more of a light sauce and still tasted very good. I put a little brown rice and a salad on the side. It was great even the second day.

My crew raved about this.  I took suggestions such as broth on the bottom of the pan and added ginger, onion powder, and garlic powder.  The gravy is outstanding and this makes an easy  alternative to stir fry. Thanks!

The entire family liked this one.  It's quick, easy and doesn't require many ingredients.
I shredded the leftover chicken and used it to make chicken stir fry!

We followed the instructions exactly and still the soy sauce burnt in pan ruining the gravy--it was truly awful.  The flavours would have been okay if it hadn't burnt.

Tasty Recipe! And the aroma was wonderful! The gravy turned out great for us. Eggs, green onions, rice, and chicken was a great combo. I'll have to find a way to make the chicken a lil juicier. I've already passed this along to a few friends- So simple!
