The key to keeping this recipe from being "too greesy" is to not over cook it. Anytime a cheese/mayo/sour cream/whatever dip has greese floating on the top, it's because it was over cooked and has "seperated". Every oven is different so cook just until the cheese has melted and then take it out and let the cheese continue to melt from the heat that the baking dish and the contents are providing. Once it is over cooked and has seperated, you can't mix the greese back in. You have to eat it like that or throw it out like one reviewer did, twice. I also would take the advice of another reviewer and use a lighter mayonaise or artichokes packed in water, but if you keep a close eye on the dip it shouldn't come out greesy like some of the complaints have said. Thanks for a great recipe. P.S. use fresh garlic for more of a kick.

I love artichokes, but hate mayonnaise, and I had a hard time trying to find a recipe that didn't call for mayo. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but I substituted one can of reduced sodium cream of celery soup for the mayo. It was phenomenal. Everyone said it was the best they ever had. I noticed that it didn't get oily on top like I've seen other dips get, and the consistency was very creamy. It was even great reheated the next day. I'm sure you could even substitute reduced-fat soup and have the same effect. It was great.

I looked this recipe up to see how long the cooking time was and to see if it differed from mine.  I use two cans of artichoke hearts packed in water and with that change I give it five stars.  Some readers complained of the grease, that is probably from using the artichokes packed in oil.

WOW!!! I made this for Christmas and it was gone quick! Everyone loved it. I only made a few changes by adding 2 garlic cloves instead of powder, and I also added mozzarella cheese to the top so that it browned and was all yummy and crunchy. :) I tore up some french bread, toasted it in the oven and served it with the dip. I don't think there was one person at the party that didn't request the recipe.

I made this dip for the first time hoping that it would taste like my friend's recipe.  I didn't like it at all.  Making the dip wasn't difficult at all, but having to use as much mayo as it called for just grossed me out.  The artichoke dip was too greasy and it tasted too much like mayonnaise.  Never again will I make this for me or for my husband.  Yuck!

Really good.  Based on some of the other reviews, and on personal preferences, I did some things slightly differently.

I used half parmesan, half romano in place of the 1 c parmesan.  I used canned artichokes (chopped well) in water to cut down on the grease.  I watched it carefully in the oven and took it out as soon as the edges were crisp and brown.

Big hit, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

Great recipe, and was very popular. Be certain and use all the parmesan cheese called for. I also used 8oz of sour cream, 1/4tsp red cayenne pepper and baked it a little longer. Very good, very easy.

This recipe was great, I used two cans of artichokes (14.5 oz in water - not marinated in oil and light mayo), and served it with cut up pita bread.  My guests went crazy for it and ate every bit!

I loved this dip.  The only thing I changed was I cut up the artichoke hearts even more.  I didn't like getting a large mouthful of artichoke heart on my cracker.

I have made this dip on multiple occasions and it's always the first appetizer to get finished off.  Can be a little greasy if you cook too long, so keep an eye on it during baking as the other reviewers said.  Highly recommend!

Very easy recipe. But if you want a creamy result, cook it in the microwave for five minutes stirring occasionally. I find that putting it in the oven causes the cheese to separate too much and the dish becomes oily.

This recipe is very good. The first time I made it I thought it was missing something. The next time I made it I added a jar of roasted red peppers. Not only did the peppers add a little bit more of a kick but color as well.

I served this last night for a "girls evening" along with some warm Syrian Bread (recipe listed in allrecipes.com as well). My friends thought that it was "restaurant quality". I felt evil: so easy to make - such a big impact!

I made this recipe as written though did use reduced fat mozzarella. It was delicious! It got rave reviews, particularly because you could actually see and taste the artichoke hearts. I served it with pita crackers and herb mini-toasts (I prefer the pita crackers). Thanks, MOIE, for the great recipe!

I had made this before and rated it 5 stars. I, personally, love it.  However, I made it again a few times and others that tried it and found it a bit too rich or overwhelming.  So I'm coming back and changing my rating to a 4 star. I will still continue to make it.  To each is their own :D xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

I didn't care for this. It didn't have much flavor & was too thick & hard to scoop. I think it needs cream cheese or sour cream to give it a lighter, creamier flavor. Wouldn't make it again.

I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Because of previous reviews I reduced the mayo to 2/3 of a cup and it wasn't to greasy. I also added cream cheese. Yummy!

Tried it, I added feta cheese because it's my favourite and it was AMAZING.. Would definitely use the hearts that were in water and not oil but overall pretty yummy

I`m very fussy with artichoke dips, but this one is very simple. I tend to add more cheese then called for and I leave it in a bit longer but overall a very nice recipe. I`ve also thrown in palm heart for a different flavour and bit more texture and it`s very good as well. I`ve been using a mix of different cheeses for more dept, Kraft was a wonderful selection of mixed cheese and I find the Italian mix to be the best...

I made this dip for my BUNCO group and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it! I did change a couple things. First I used three 6.5 oz jars drained and chopped, next I used 4 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and 1/2 cup sour cream (along with the mayo) I also put in a table spoon of Worchestershire sauce. I followed the other reviews and dd not over bake. It was wonderful! Next time I might add some peppers for a little spice.

Great recipe!  Based on other reviews, I used artichoke hearts in water rather than oil and chopped them up in a food processor.  I also added a can of green chilies for a little kick.  Since I added the chilies, I cut down the amount of garlic my second time making it to about 3/4 tsp and thought it had a good balance.  Got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe.

This recipe seemed suspect to me the first time I used it- but my friend swore by it...So I gave it a shot , and it is perfect as it is.
I, however, can't leave well enough alone.
I use a combination of light cream cheese and mayo or sour cream at times. I also use fresh garlic, half a clove, in my press. Fresh cracked pepper is a wonderful addition.
Also, the majority of flavor comes from the MARINATED artichoke hearts. Using water packed is silly- but if you must: then at least add some italian seasoning and some olive oil.

I made this as an experiment for my fiances family gathering. Now everytime we get invited for dinner everyone asks me to bring it over. I love it and the families love it! I have been using "HOT" marinated artichoke hearts and it seems to give it a zippier flavor and does not make the dip TOO spicy. I also started adding a small can of chopped jalipenos, which everyone seems to like a little more. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! If you try any Artichoke dip recipes try this one, you will not be disappointed.

This was OK.  My guests really liked it, but it didn't have much of an "artichoke" flavor.  I would call it "Baked Cheese Dip with Artichokes" because it does have more of a cheese flavor than an artichoke flavor.  If I make it again, I'll double the amount of artichokes.  I will continue searching for a great artichoke dip.

I've tried to make this recipe twice.  Both times, it got hard, brown and crusty on the sides and there was about an inch of grease floating on top.  I've had to throw it out both times!  I'm so disappointed.  What am I doing wrong?

Very easy, very quick recipe for a party appetizer.  I promise you that people will stand around this dip!  When I buy the can/jar of artichokes, I usually cut them up even more so I just have a big pile of artichoke pieces...makes for easier dipping with toasted bagette slices.

I thought this was really good as a spread on french rolls, but it didn't really seem like something I would use for a dip. I ate it with bread and soup and it was a nice addition to the meal. Thanks for the recipe!  :)

Love it, we keep it on a warmer when it comes out of the oven, stays nice and warm. Blot the top with bread , throw the bread away.

Based on user reviews, I doubled the amount of artichoke hearts and substituted a can of cream of celery soup for the mayonnaise.  I tasted the mixture before baking it and thought the celery flavor was overwhelming, but after baking it, the flavor was very subtle, and using soup instead of mayo kept it from getting greasy.  Next time I'll add some crushed red pepper or sriracha to the mixture before baking, but the boys loved it on French bread.

I hosted a party over the weekend and made 4 different appetizers all from AR. This one was by far the biggest hit. I changed nothing from the recipe and only watched it closely to make sure the grease didn't settle at the top like others had complained. I found 30 minutes on the dot to be the perfect amount of time in the oven. Very tasty dip!

Honestly, I am blown away by how YUMMY this dip is.  I have made it several times for parties and it is the first thing that goes.  We put it on a sourdough bread and it is hard to resist not eating the whole bowl.  I use one can of cream of celery instead of mayonnaise and I ususally double the reciepe.  You won't be dissapointed.

Delicious and decadent.  I chopped the artichoke up finely and mixed everything together before putting it in a dish.  I made sure not to overcook and took it out of the oven after 23 min.  My company is raving about it and wants the recipe.  The best thing is how easy it is you can throw it together with stuff you have on hand.

This was good although I thought it needed a little something, so after tasting the original recipe I added some chipotle powder and some fresh jalapeno.  Really spiced it up.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I love this recipe since it is so simple.  Our family makes it all the time for get togethers and everyone raves about it.  I like to put all the ingredients directly into a 9x13 pan to mix together so I have less dish washing to do.  Also, we like to have it lightly browned all over, but be careful not to overcook it, otherwise it will be very greasy, and it looses its great taste.

Wow! I admit, I was skeptical about this recipe based on the amount of mayo used. But this was a huge hit at the party! I used a shredded asiago/parmesan mix in place of the grated parmesan cheese, plus the 2 cups mozz. I also only used 1 can of arichoke hearts in brine, but rinsed them after chopping to get rid of some of the vinegar taste. I hollowed out a loaf of rye bread and baked the dip in it, and served the cubed bread with carrots, celery and crackers for dipping. Big hit!

Definitely pay attention to how your oven cooks when making this recipe. Mine was melted and ready to go after about 20 minutes...had I left it in any longer, I might've had a greasy mess. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Instead of using 2 jars of artichokes, I used a package of frozen spinach & I also added a cup of sour cream. Very rich & tasty!

Yes you can fix this if  it is separated! 
Separation is caused from overheating. 
You can remedy this by using a paper towel to dab off most of the oil. 
Then simply add crushed ice a little at a time to cool off the mixture , like magic the oil disappears.

Pretty good, but I think to much mozzarella, it was not the consistency I expected. I did add some dried onions which I liked. Sorry, but I have had better. I will try again, but with less mozzarella.

It smelled and looked wonderful right out of the oven but unfortunately it became much too greasy after it cooled slightly.  The taste was pretty good and I think that if you used cream of celery soup would make it much better.

Pretty yummy!  Only baked this about 20-22 min instead of 30, worked great, was hot and melty enough and the cheese did not separate and look greasy as it did for some others. Super easy, too! Served w/ritz crackers. Used some leftovers on toasted bread w/thinly sliced tomatoes marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar on top under the broiler for 5 min (also added some Ital seasonings and a little extra parm on tomatoes) and it was great!

We loved this dip! I chopped the artichoke hearts, and substituted the Mayo for sour cream....since most reviewers claimed it was too greasy, I used a loaf pan instead amd cooked for 30 min.  This allowed a depth, so mine was not greasy at all! Thanks for the recipe!

"Best dip I've had in a long time" ... quote from the hubby. The teenager said, "this is kinda gross but I think we're going to finish this whole pan". Was a hit, obviously. I did modify a bit. We were just in Chicago for Easter and enjoyed a spicy artichoke dip that I was trying to re-create. Here's what I did - had one tall jar of artichoke hearts in the fridge, which I drained and diced up smaller and mixed in with half cup mayo, quarter cup each of sour cream and cream cheese, cup of romano (thats what I had) and a bit over a cup of a prov/mozz mix. Added garlic paste to this, little black pepper and red pepper flakes. Baked at 350 about 30 mins, pulled it out and sprinkled with paprika and some additional shredded romano. Allowed it to settle and we all agreed, it was best with pita chips. Thanks for posting this one!

Divided the recipe into two pie plates.  Baked one and took to friends house for dinner and refrigerated other and baked the next day for an Easter appetizer.  Served with pretzel thins and rosemary & olive oil triscuits.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Great way to cut the fat....use lowfat mayo and 2% mozzerella cheese. Kraft makes a good one that's still meltable. (Sometimes, you buy that lowfat cheese and it dosen't melt AT ALL.) You could even use half FF sour cream and half lowfat mayo and still come out ahead. This is AWESOME with homemade pita chips or spicy tortilla chips.

Great dip, received many comments when I made for a Christmas party recently. Changes: add 1/2 cup sour cream, substitute garlic powder with 1 tbsp whole minced garlic.  Try: 1 tbsp thyme mixed in for added flavor, for spice add 1/2 cup jalapeno peppers.

Served this as an appetizer at an Italian themed dinner party.  Everyone loved the addition of the almonds.  I made the day before and baked prior to the party.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a party we had recently. I used fresh shredded parm instead of grated and I added about a 1/2 cup extra mozza. and covered the top of the dip before I put it in the oven. I used quartered artichokes in water and just cut them up into smaller pieces. This dip was wonderful and I served it with french bread cut into chunks. Thanks for the recipe

made this for the first time this Thanksgiving, everyone loved it and my mom said " You can just make this from now on" I found the recipe very simple.  I was told I would be bringing this to super bowl 2009 so I double the recipe and it was devoured almost immediately!

So easy to make and absolutely wonderful to eat!  For everyone saying it turns out too greasy, after you remove it from the oven, put a piece of bread on top to absorb the grease, then throw the bread away.

I only made 1/2 a recipe because I had only 1 jar of artichokes, and it turned out delicious.  I thought it was a little dry, so I added about 1/4 C of sour cream before baking.  I used light versions of the mayo and sr. cream.  Still good!

This dip is the best! The first time I had it was a Christmas party at work 20 years ago. I just had to have the recipe and couldn't believe it was so easy. I lost it over the years and was so glad to find it posted here!

I made this dip for a 4th of July picnic and it vanished!!  It did seem too salty, though, so next time I make it, I'm not going to use marinated artichokes, just plain.  I also added about 1 c. chopped spinach.  It was an excellent addition!!  This one's going into my recipe box!

For the calorie counters...I used lowfat mayo and fat free mozzerella cheese, and the dip still tasted great.  The parmesan cheese still adds alot of fat/calories, but not much you can do about that!  I served spread on sliced french bread, yummy!

This was so easy and so good -- EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  I used artichoke hearts in water instead of oil, and used a mozzarella/provolone shredded blend along with fresh shaved parmesan.  I added minced garlic and some chopped roasted peppers.  REALLY GOOD!!!

I have always made an artichoke dip recipe using
cream cheese.  This recipe was not oily like my
old recipe. I received so many compliments and requests for this recipe. It will be the one I use from now on.  Thanks for sharing it.

when i order an appetizer at a restaurant, i *always* go for the artichoke dip.  love love love it.  this?  i don't even know what to say.  thankfully my kids liked it so the $15 i spent on making it didn't go to waste.  it smelled wonderful while cooking.  it came out looking exactly like the picture & i used the exact ingredients in the exact measurements but...blah.

This was very good, I followed Angela M's suggestion and used the cream of celery soup instead of may.  I used the 98% fat free kind. I will definitely try the reduced sodium next time, with all that cheese I think it could use a little less salt.  I really think next time I may add some red bell pepper, think that would be tasty in this!

YUM!!! This was a huge hit in my house I always make some at Christmas, New Years, and Easter. In fact I am making some right now. No alterations and no substitutions and it is a guaranteed good dip! I serve this with pita bread, and crackers, and in a couple hours it's all gone!

This was delicious and there were no left overs of this at my party! I did as others suggested with no mayo but 1 can of cr. of celery and I added 2 14 oz cans of well chopped artichoke hearts in water. I also seasoned plain bread crumbs and put them on top. I used fresh garlic instead of powder. It was so good on some pita chips! YUMMY thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

the flavor was excellent but it seemed to have way too much cheese....I know it seems impossible...but I had taken to a party and it was difficult to dip because of all the cheese.  It all kind of came up with the 1 chip.  It definately got worse after being out of the oven for just a few minutes.  It almost needed to be kept on a hot plate to keep the cheese from clumping. I will definately make again but use less cheese so that it's nice and creamy.  thanks for a great recipe!

What a great recipe! Instead of using a cup of mayo, I used 1/2 cup of light mayo, and 1/2 cup light cream cheese. It wasn't greasy at all and it was sooo yummy! My hubby and i ate the entire thing by ourselves! :)

I made this for a new years eve party.  It was a hit as we ran out with only about 16 people attending.  I made only one change.  I added 3 six oz. (no 6 1/2 available) jars of marinated artichoke hearts well drained.

AWESOME recipe! I halved it (it was just my husband and I eating it) and kept the mayonnaise to about 3/4 cup, took out the garlic b/c we're allergic to garlic and just added one slice of chopped up onion. Perfect!!

I thought the taste of this was delicious - the only thing I'd change is replacing the mozzarella with some other kind of cheese - probably parmesan.  I didn't care for how stringy it made the dip.  I used gruyere for the parmesan, so maybe I'd do a mix of parmesan, gruyere and maybe romano or asiago.  That would eliminate the stringiness and add some more flavor.

Can't complain at all.  I made sure I bought the artichoke hearts canned in water. I chopped them up so that I wouldn't have chunks of artichokes in my dip and I used light mayonnaise as well. It's good to read through the reviews to get all the tips. This recipe is so good that next time I will add something else to it to make a lobster artichoke dip like that at Red Lobster or a spinach artichoke dip like the one at Milestones. It's a nice thick restaurant quality dip. Loved it.

Definately a keeper! I gave it 4 stars because I made just a some tweeks to it. 1. Substitued the marinated jar artichoke for 2 (13.75 oz) cans of artichoke heart quarters in water, then diced into bite sized pieces. 2. Took one member's reccommendation and used 1 can cream of celery in place of one cup mayo. 3. Mixed one diced tomato and 3 peices of chopped green onion in the mix instead of on top. 4. Used 1 tbsp of chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. 5. Used 3c parmesean cheese instead of 2c par & 1c romano (didnt have romano on hand..) and at 25 min, I switched the oven to broil and watched carefully to make the top extra crispy!!!! Wonderful recipe and great to bring to parties/ barbeques with wheat thins!!

Like another recipe, I substituted the mayo for a can of condensed Cream of Celery soup, since I didn't personally like the idea of mayo baking in the oven.  Came out absolutely great: soft and melty on top and very solid beneath.  Served with some name-brand nachos: at least as good as restaurant quality!

Wow!  What an amazing Artichoke Dip!  I followed some of the other dissenters and used Cream of Celery Soup instead of Mayonaise.  The thought of that much mayo made me want to vomit.  I served this dish to my family with some garlic-buttered Ciabatta bread, and they ate it all!  

Oh yes, I almost forgot, I boiled fresh spinach from the farmers market and made it into an "Artichoke & Spinach Dip."  I also followed some of the other reviewers and their advice to chop up the artichokes as small as possible.  Maybe next time I will use fresh artichokes?  :)  Happy cooking!

Have made this several times and it is a favorite of kids and adults. Most recently I tried the tip of substituting a can of cream of celery soup for the mayo. Who knew? A big calorie saver without sacrificing taste! I've also added a pinch of cayenne and/or sauteed, chopped red onions for a little kick.

I have another recipe from the olive garden that I just love, but this one was right up there. I too used the cream of celery soup instead of the mayo, it made it alot cheaper to make and easier. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, as a snack b4 we were ready to eat, it got great praise.

I fixed this for an appetizer for a special dinner I made for my husband.  He loved it!!!! He loved it so much that I only got two crackers worth.  I only made half a recipe, but I think next I better make the whole thing if I want any.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried the recipe a few months ago at a family gathering and everyone loved it. I have made it many more times since then but took it to a party a week ago and decided to make an extra batch to cook there.  Thank goodness I did - the first batch was gone within minutes.  To keep the dip nice and warm I cook it in my stoneware.

pretty good recipe.  Based on other reviews, I used 2 canns of quartered artichokes packed in water, and squeezed out the excess water after draining.  However, using that much mozz cheese does produce a greasy dish, even if you pull it out of the oven before over-cooking.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and add 1 C. sour cream in the place of 1 C. of mozz.  Also, with that much mozz, it hardens quite a bit as it cools down, making it very hard to scoop.  Substituting sour cream for 1 C. mozz should help this as well.

The taste wasn't bad but I the cheese didn't really melt and it was kind of dry.

The recipe was pretty good.  I was debating whether or not to use marinated artichoke hearts or just the canned ones.  I used marinated ones, and the dip came out kind of vinegary.  If you do use marinated ones, don't add any salt or any other flavorings, and make sure you drain them very well, as they have quite a strong taste.  Other than that, this recipe was good, everybody in my family raved about it, I was the only one with a few problems with it.  Thanks for the post, I will definately try it again!

This recipe is a snap to make and goes over great.  I recently made it for a dinner party and it was almost gone before I got a sample myself.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Artichokes, cheese and mayo... how can you go wrong?  Everytime we make this dish it's a HUGE hit.  Sometimes we use fresh garlic, but powdered is fine too.  This recipe is pretty darn unhealthy, but if you want to splurge and impress your guests, it's a must.  Serve with bread, crackers, veggies... anything tastes good with it.

This stuff is sooo good. We don't add paprkia. But beware: too much and you'll be trying to work it off at the gym for a week. Bake some sliced french bread. Make sure you invite lots of friends over, and serve this as and appetizer. They will want to come back for more each week. Oh... use good quality mayonnaise otherwise you will have a thick layer of oil (ewwee).

I made this for a party last night, and it was great!!! Unfortunately, there were a lot of people and they ate most of it before I could even get to try it! The little I did have though was awesome. Hehe...but it was a sure hit! I'll be sure to make this again soon! My friends also asked for the recipe too. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I added 2 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.  My family and friends ate it all up.

This recipe has become my new favorite.  It's delicious just the way it is.  I've experimented and have gotten great results.  I've added mushrooms, real garlic instead of garlic salt, and some crushed red pepper...yum!  When I bring this dish to functions, everyone wants the recipe!

Too salty, in my opinion.  Especially garlicky.  If the artichokes are marinated, I don't recommend adding the suggested garlic salt.  Otherwise it tasted just fine!

Really good but I guess artichoke dip is just not my thing even though I love marinated artichoke hearts. I failed to pick through the hearts to get a couple of stringy leaves out. These were not desireable. I reheated it as leftovers (better the next night) but added a couple of drops of hot sauce to zip it up a bit. The cheese was a tasty mixture.

This is the best dip ever!  I served it twice in one week at two different parties.  It disapeared very quickly!!!!The second time I had barely got back from returning the oven mitts to the kitchen when it was all gone!  I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic to give it an extra zip.  i also kept a close eye on it from 20 minuits on in order not to overcook.  Will definately make again and again.

This recipe was the easiest one I've ever made.  My guests loved it, asked for the recipe many times.  I would like to try to "downsize" the calories and fat so I won't feel so bad about eating it.  But...I love it and will make it again.  Thank you

Pretty good.  I used half the parmesan to make it a little less tangy and it turned out well.  I still haven't found it's as good as the restaurant artichoke dips I've had.

I must have done something wrong because it was very oily and not creamy at all. The taste was very good but over all the dip was stringy and much too greasy.

great appetizer recipe - chop artichoke hearts in a food processor. Much easier than chopping them with a knife. I served this on New Year's Eve and it was a hit.

Very good!  I made the mistake of serving this with small slices of sourdough bread instead of french bread.  Stick with the french bread for dipping and this is a good one.

Delicious! I made this for a Christmas appetizer and EVERYONE loved it! Even my sister-in-law who shouldn't' be eating dairy kept eating it!  This one's a keeper! The marinated artichokes add so much flavor. I did chop them into smaller pieces.

A friend shared this recipe with me many years ago. It is easy to make and has such a wonderful flavor. The next time I make this, I will add chopped water chestnuts for an added crunch.

I guess I have a certain taste in my mind for artichoke dip, and this wasn't it.  It was very, very cheeeeeesy, gobs of cheese, and couldn't strongly taste the artichokes.  I followed the recipe to a T, but I did take it out a bit earlier so it wouldn't separate and get oily.  If I were going to tweak it, I would double the artichokes and reduce the mozzarella by a cup probably.

Really good! Very cheesy. I tried this with tortilla chips, it's really too thick though. Better off using crackers or French bread as recommended.

This was soooo yummy.  I could only find 7.5oz cans of the marinated artichoke hearts, but did not increase the mayo and found it to be perfect.  We do not like things that taste to mayo-ish and this did not at all!! I will make this again!!!!

Restaurant quality...if not even better.  This dip is off the hook delicious.  Served with warm soft breadsticks this is one of the best dips I have even tasted,  everyone loved this one, even the kids, just don't tell them it has artichokes in it. I substituted the mozz for a parm/romano cheese blend.  YUMMY!!!

This was very good and simple to make.  My family really liked it too.  I liked the addition of mozzeralla cheese. I would maybe try the cream of celery soup next time.  I just hate using that much mayonnaise (even lower fat) in anything.  I baked exactly 30 min. and it didn't get particularly brown, but didn't separate either as some reviewers had commented.  I would make this again.

I made this twice over the holidays, for two different family gatherings, an it was a big hit at both! So simple to make, this will become a staple in my recipe repertoire. Easy to make ahead of time as well, and just bake before serving.

Also great reheated the next day; the flavors really seemed enhanced.

I substituted the mayonnaise with Cream of Celery, and added a can of diced green chilies. Everyone at the party enjoyed eating this dip with sour dough bread and restaurant style tortilla chips.  Next time I make this, I will separate more of the artichokes into pieces, rather than making it chunky.

I have been making this recipe for years now and it is always requested by husband for any special event (the super bowl especially).  I have made a few changes to this recipe over the years and this is the one that I stick with......I add 1 1/2 tbl of chopped jalapenos and skip the paprika.  I always get some good rustic italian bread and cut it into good sized chunks for dipping.  Love it, I will be making it this weekend as a matter of fact.

I was really sketchy about this recipe because of all the mayo,  but i tried it and EVERYONE loved it.  Of course, then i felt weird giving them a recipe that called for so much mayo.  It's very rich, but yummy.

AWESOME! Usually I make a spinach and artichoke dip (recipe courtesy of Alton Brown of Good Eats), but my husband wanted just artichokes. This was great! I used a three-cheese blend (Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago) instead of just Parmesan. I also used a 14-ounce can of quartered artichoke hearts instead of the marinated ones to avoid the vinegar taste. I grated up an 8-ounce block of mozzarella and didn't bother measuring it. It was great even before baking! BE WARNED: Our dip was done after 20 minutes. You might want to cook it for 15 minutes and then watch it closely as I did to avoid the greasy-pool problem. Thanks, Maureen, for the great recipe!

Be sure to chop the artichoke hearts.

Awesome! Only change I made was to use canned artichokes and chop them finely. I served with tortilla chips but I think that crackers or bread would be better. This is something that I will make often.

Very good!  I used a garlic clove instead of the powder and light mayo.  Don't overcook or it will become greasy.

I only had about 3/4 cup of mayo left so filled the rest of the cup with sour cream.  This was good, but not my favorite artichoke dip recipe.  I'll keep looking! It was very pretty though and I'll bet you could make it with all sour cream instead of mayo, and fat free or light (I used light mayo and regular sour cream).

I have never made artichoke dip before tonight.  I made it for a dinner party and it was THE HIT.  Everyone loved it. Check out the review on 1-8-2003  for some excellent advice on making this dip perfectly.  I served it with cut up pieces of fresh french bread. Also, per other reviews, I chopped up the artichokes to avoid large clumps of artichoke in the dip.  Excellent recipe and I will make it again.

I made this dip for a Halloween party and it was a huge hit.  People kept coming up to me and telling me how good it was.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I will absolutly make this recipe again.

I made this recipe two times over the holidays and people LOVED it! I corsley chop the artichokes before putting them in the mix for more even distribution and easier handling on crackers and bread.  I plan to make it for a football party today and serve it with sliced hot baguettes and vegetables.

Good luck!

I made this dip for a girl's night out and it was a big success!  I did make some changes though, 1. I used jack/cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella, 2.I chopped two fresh garlic cloves, 3. I used one large jar of artichokes then I drained and chopped them, 4. I baked it for 15-20 minutes, and 5. I added some crushed pepper flakes to cut the richness.

A five-star recipe through and through. This one is a HUGE crowd pleaser -- even among my college friends. Hugely flavourful, great on tortilla chips, and filling. Easy to make, although a bit expensive with all the cheese and artichokes. This would be a HUGE success at any potluck. Just make it, bring it over, and ask to bake it in your host's oven.

This dip was quick, easy and delicious!  I used a can of artichokes packed in water and light mayo.  We loved it!  I made it an hour ahead and left it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it.  Yum!

This is very good.  I served it to my in-laws. It is now a family favorite.  Instead of garlic powder I added fresh garlic minced very finely. And put the oven on broil till the top browns a little. Baking it made it quite oily.
