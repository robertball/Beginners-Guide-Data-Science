I made several batches of cereal mix.  This was the first one eaten.  It wasn't very spicy and next time I would increase the amount of pepper.  Overall though, the flavor was good and have a slightly sweet under tone.

The 1st time I made this in a jelly roll pan and it came out with a slight burned taste.  The second time I made this I put it in a roaster pan and it came out much better.  Nice bit of spice kick.  Next time I may add just a bit more brown sugar for a little more sweet taste.
