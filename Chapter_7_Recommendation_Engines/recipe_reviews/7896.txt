A really good recipe!  I did make it without the orange peel, however.  The beer gives it a nice lift & airy texture.  Even the 3 -yr old liked it!

This is a really great recipe.  It's a great contrast to all of the overly sweet desserts that pop up around the holidays.  It's still sweet, of course, but in a much more hearty way.  One change I made was to cook it in a bundt pan, which made it much more aesthetically pleasing and fun.  It does take slightly longer to cook this way, however, so trust the toothpick!

I had high hopes for this, and the house DID smell wonderful as it baked.... I was skeptical about the whole wheat flour, but followed the recipe, it has a great taste, but I don't like the grainy texture from the wheat flour, I may use all white flour and try it again. I don't rate recipes I have rewritten and changed, and folks who like wheat flour better than I may like this better than I, but it kind of ruined it for me.

I made this for my Scots-Irish dad, who is not a fan of super-sweet, super-rich desserts, and he enjoyed this gingerbread a lot. For my younger siblings, I put a dollop of Maple Cream Cheese frosting (from this website) on a few slices of gingerbread, and they loved it.   I made this gingerbread with a thick, dark, home-brewed stout, which went really well with the recipe. My only modifications: I left out the orange peel and almonds, and doubled the raisins.

I omitted the nuts, and doubled the candied fruit.  This will make a great Christmas gingerbread! By cutting the recipe in half and baking in the 9x13 pan, these were like Hermit bar cookies, and I love those, too!

I've been searching for a recipe for gingerbread like the one my Scottish grandma used to make so I was excited to find this one and try it out. Sadly, it just wasn't like the traditional gingerbread I grew up with. I don't remember having raisins, orange peel or almonds in ours. I might try it again, omitting these 3 ingredients and see if it tastes more authentic. But as it stands, this one didn't work for me.

De-LIGHT-ful! A delicious cake melding all of the holiday flavors and aromas. It was airy and dense at the same time, it's hard to describe. The flavor was subtle, I may use a heavier hand with the spices next time. Also, I may serve smaller pieces next time or add a frosting (a maple nut was suggested in another review). For the beer, I used Blue Moon. It was quick and easy. I will be making it again. Thank you Carol!

A very pleasant surprise.
