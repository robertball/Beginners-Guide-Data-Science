I have mixed feelings about this one. I followed the recipe exactly.  The "dough" was incredibly difficult to work with.  It continuously crumbled, making it hard to form and roll out.  I did the best I could, brought them to a bridal shower and people thought they were great.  I am not sure if they are worth the effort, although they tasted good?

I followed the recipe exactly also and realized the dough was a bit too crumbly. I then drizzled the dough with about 1 1/2 tbs cold beer and it did the trick.  i set aside some dough without the cajun seasoning in it and I made a second batch which I flavored by sprinkling oregano and chilly flakes onto the dough prior to cutting it, this time in round shapes instead of straws.  Personally I like the recipe, I think some of us are having problems with the dough due to the temperature of our butter.

I should give these a 2 because they needed some major help.  As the others mentioned, the dough had issues and was not able to be kneaded or rolled flat.  I think LilAngel's right; something must've been left out of this one: liquid.  I used Draculeen's idea and added some beer to achieve the right  consistency. I took a little taste of the dough and noticed the Dijon and Cajun spice flavors were lost, so I added QUITE a large amount more Dijon and it still was not prominent.  When they came out of the oven, I thought they looked rather dry so I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled some more cheddar on top to melt.  My husband said they tasted a bit like Cheez-Its and ate his with ranch, but he was not at all impressed with these, and nor was I.

I'm also not so sure about this one. The dough does not get crumbly. I added one egg and butter to it to form a dough. They may have left something out of this one. It's ok but don't know if I would go through the trouble again. No one ood and awed.
