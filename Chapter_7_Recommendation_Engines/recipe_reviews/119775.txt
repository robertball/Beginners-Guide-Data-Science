My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I couldn't bear to toss out the marinade with all those delicious onion and garlic pieces, so I put it on the stove and reduced it down for a great sauce to drizzle over the steak.

This is really good!  I made 1/2 the recipe and marinated two ribeyes in a ziplock bag for about 3 hours, and they were delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and garlic salt instead of garlic cloves (forgot to buy garlic).  My boyfriend and I loved the flavor.  I always use A1 on my steaks, but the flavor was sooo good I didn't even use it this time!  I will definitely be making this again!!

I don't eat steaks that often, but my husband loves them. I decided to use this rib eye marinade, it was out this world that I even ate a whole steak myself, the steak melted in my mouth. Now I will have to make this once a week. Was even better than fancy steak restaurants. The only thing I changed was using low sodium soy sauce. DELICIOUS Thanks again

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't salty at all.  I only had 90 min to spare for marinating my steaks and they were still VERY flavorful.  I also don't have a "real" grill so I cooked them on my George Foreman grill.  

Thank you!

This is an excellent marinade! My husband loved it! I added a little red pepper to spice it up, but could still taste the other flavors. This is going to be the steak at my families summer get-together!!!

I just made this for our father's day barbeque and it was gobbled up by everyone!!!  I doubled the recipe and marinated it overnight and it was close to being the best steak I have ever made at home.  Fantastic recipe!

As with most recipes I get from this sight, I try them out on the the guys I work with at the firehouse. 10 guys and everyone of them loved the steak. I tripled this recipe for 10 Ribeyes and followed it to the T. This one is a keeper. Thank you

Wow, what a steak!  Marinated a 1.25lb top sirloin steak for 3 days (didn't mean to let it sit that long, but it turned out great).  Thinly sliced across the grain, it was fork tender.

I marinated overnight. I knew this was a hit when my family didn't drown the steaks in steak sauce (none needed).  A keeper!

As I read the ingredients for this recipe I knew I would like this right away as I grew up eating meats flavored with these exact ingredients (sugar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic). However, I used freshly grated ginger instead of powdered, about a thumb size, as well as all of the juice of the ginger. I minced 3 garlic cloves and I kept the soy sauce, brown sugar, black pepper the same. I always use C&H golden brown sugar and low sodium Aloha Soy Sauce. I did not have any green onions. I took a fork and pricked the rib eye steaks. I threw all the ingredients into a gallon ziplock bag. I marinated the 2 rib eye steaks for 9 hours. Once I heated up the grill to medium high, I put the steaks onto the grill and listened for that wonderful sizzle. After about 7 minutes, I had that nice dark brown grill marks and then flipped it over to the other side to cook . I like my steaks a little more medium rare. When the steaks were done and I set them aside to let the meat rest and juices redistribute. I sliced them up against the grain. I found these steaks not only delicious but juicy and tender. They were so flavorful and almost buttery. I liked how each time I picked up a piece of the steak I could see the juices and it would ooze in my mouth as I chewed the steak. Perfect! I would definitely make these again. Not only did my family eat everything up, the bones were cleaned too!  I served these with hot rice, creamy sweet corn, buttery cooked carrots, all from this website.

Found this recipe and tried it for something different for a Sunday dinner. The steaks had only 2-hours to marinate. I substituted  Sugar Twin brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce for those two ingredients. 
My husband raved, RAVED about the flavor. Upon request I described the ingredient list for him.
Simple marinade and a hit at our dinner table.
Thanks a lot.

Superb all around marinade for rib-eye or NY steaks.  I use low sodium soy sauce and add about 1/4 cup of worchestershire sauce to make it even more tasty (use regular worchestershire sauce, not low sodium - doesn't taste the same).  Comes off the grill just incredibly delicious as is.

Usually I prefer this type of marinade with pork or lamb rather than beef. Decided to give it a try based on the positive reviews and I am so glad I did. My family loved it. Instead of using ground ginger, I used ginger paste.

Tried this for the first time last night.  I marinated the steaks overnight and they turned out great.  Love the marinade but I personally think it is slightly salty.  Should reduce the amount of soy sauce and add a bit of red wine or Worcestershire sauce next time!

Very good my husband and I loved the flavors.  The only changes were to add 1/4 tsp Tabasco Spicy Soy Sauce to give the marinade a little kick and to use Tamari soy sauce which tastes less salty and is more flavorful.  Marinade the rib eyes overnight and the next evening barbequed the steaks till rare.  We grilled fresh pineapple and put on top the steaks and used the remaining marinade to made a reduction which was drizzled over the steaks to finish WOW!!!!!!!

Excellent!  Whether we marinade for 2 hrs or overnight....always delicious!  Substituted Tamari for soy for my gluten intolerant dtr, and just as tasty!  Trying it with chicken tonight...should be good!

This marinade had a nice flavor but was too strong for us. We couldn't even taste the steak any more.  I marinated it for 7 hours.  Maybe if I marinated it only for an hour we would have liked it better.

Yum! Have used this multiple times now - w/ rib eyes, sirloin and tri tip.  works w/ all. I usually make it without the onions since I usually don't have any, and use 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic cloves since I don't have any those either.  Doesn't matter - delicious everytime.

This was really very good.  Steak was flavorful and tender.  I didn't use a drop of steak sauce and that's unusual for me.  I used half of the marinade for the steaks,(4hrs), and I simmered and reduced the other half and we spooned onto white rice.  I used the Forman grill which worked great.  The sugars that burned just flaked right off.  I will definitely be making this again.  I did add about a tablespoon of finely chopped red pepper to the marinade.  I freeze "chips" of red pepper and then it's really easy to finely chop them while frozen.

Incredible flavor! I only had time to marinate for 3 hours, and it seemed like plenty to me. I think I may try 6 hours next time to see if the flavor is even better without being too salty.

Amazing flavor! The steaks were very salty though. If there wasn't so much salt (in the soy sauce) this would be the best steak ever!

I registered for this site to comment on this, and one other recipe.  This is one of the best marinades I've had.  I did make a few changes for what I had on hand, and our dietary choices.  I used finely chopped onions and parsley (for color) as I didn't have green onions. I used Splenda Brown sugar as we don't use regular sugar.  I marinated for 6 hours due to time, and the steak was still tender and moist.  I've since used this recipe for a chicken stir fry and plan on using it for salmon.  A new favorite in our house.

I used this marinade on rib eye steaks for a Fathers Day dinner I made. The marinade was really yummy & I got a lot of compliments on dinner. Nobody needed steak sauce for their steak. The only changes I made was add a TBSP of vinegar (I always use vinegar when marinating steak) and I substituted a white onion b/c I didn't have a green onion. The steaks were great. Still not as good as going out to a restaurant, but fantastic for being home. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was far too salty and we used reduced sodium soya sauce. It also took much longer to cook than we were expecting thus it had to go back on the bbq. Not something we'd make again however it was tender and flavourful.

My family LOVES this marinade! It is so tasty! We have used it on other cuts of meat as well, and it is just as good. Just throw it on the Traeger grill....Mmm! I am drooling just thinking about it!

Amazing! These were so delicious and juicy! We used low sodium soy sauce and we cooked them on our George Foreman. Lets just say the flavor was so good I even ate all the fat and gristle (which I never do)!

Very good marinade. I tried it with chicken breast strips also and it was wonderful. In fact I think I prefer it with chicken. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is awesome.   About the only thing different I did was add a little bit of red wine. Beef always goes well with that.

I only had time to marinate for 3 hours but next time I will plan ahead and marinate overnight.  Even after 3 hours, the steaks were delicious and I can hardly wait to taste them after 24!

Sorry, but not a fan of this recipe.  The meat was was very tender, but rib eye is an excellent grilling steak any way.  The marinade was too overpowering and tasted mainly like soy sauce.

This was excellent! I marinated the steaks for 15 hours for a Labor Day cookout. I didn't have the green onions on hand so I used 1/2 cup of chopped dried onion. The steaks were so tender, cutting through these was literally like cutting through butter.  I thought about reducing the marinade for a sauce like other reviewers did, but it was so flavorful and juicy that we didn't need it. This was gobbled up by my ridiculously picky in-laws. Thanks for a wonderful and very easy recipe.

Quick and easy to mix up and they turned out DELICIOUS! I used low sodium soy sauce since I don't like as much salt in my food as most people and I always figure if somebody wants it more salty they can sprinkle more salt on later. Instead of tossing out the remaining marinade I mixed it in with some hamburger meat and grilled hamburger patties as well. We thought they tasted awesome too.

This is possibly the best steak I've ever had. I usually use steak sauce or BBQ, but as other reviews of this recipe indicated - no other sauces are needed. So juicy and flavorful. And easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand. Dropped it in the marinade before going to work and had for dinner that evening. Served with corn on the cob and garlic bread.

This was pretty good. I didn't find it too salty as other reviewers mentioned. In fact, I will add my usual Montreal Steak Seasoning to it next time. Marinated for 12 hours.

I was going to follow this recipe to the T until I saw that i had 1/2c green onions! that was just too much for me so i cut that in half... once I put everything together I tasted it and felt it was missing a few things... so i added about a tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds 1 teaspoon of honey and about a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and I think it is absolulty delish!

Great marinade!!   My family loved their steaks. It works in 4 hours if you can't do it overnight. Regular onions will do too!  Enjoy!

very very very very good!!!  My hubby and I make the BEST steak ever....all of our friends would agree as they request often.  We have not eaten at a steak house for many years because we think we make the best of the best...I decided to make this for a change and so glad that I did.  The only change I made was reduce the left over marinade and baste during the end part of cooking.  Using bone-in steaks is the key as it has more flavor and is juicer!  I will for sure make this again as my whole family really liked it!

Best steak I ever tasted! My sister used tenderizer on the meat first and it came out so tender it was heavenly. The flavor of the marinade is wonderful...a bit salty but I like it that way! VERY VERY GOOD!

I had some tomato basil feta cheese and some strip steaks in the freezer so I decided to try this recipe. Like everyone stated, it's super easy and very tasty. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't use the olives since I didn't have any. I served it with baby spinach sauteed in butter and garlic.  A definite winner in our family.

Wow! This was really good. I usually don't marinate my steaks in anything, but I saw the reviews on this recipe. I decided to give it a go. The already tender and juicy was even MORE so. I will be using this recipe alot.

Not impressed with this at all. We tried as others said to do the low sodium soy sauce.  This really had no taste at all.  I don't think I would make this again for steaks

This was very good. I grilled shrimp with them (different marinade). I cut the steak in large cubes and put them on a skewer with grape tomatoes and served over rice. It has a definite Asian/Teriyake flare.

Absolutely one of the best steaks we have ever eaten.  The only thing I changed was to just add a Tbsp. of the adobo sauce as we needed it to be less spicy.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

My husband almost never gives a recipe 5 stars, but this one deserved it! I didn't really follow the recipe exactly: I used the ingredients listed (though I substituted minced onion for the scallions), but I didn't measure anything, and I didn't marinade the meat, because I didn't have the time. I basted it a few times during the cooking, which I did in the oven at 400 F. It was so delish! Thanks Tim!!

The steaks were definately tender and juicy. I didn't have a lot of time to marinate so I used UNSEASONED meat tenderizer and the steaks turned fantastic.
It's a nice change of pace for steaks.
It gives them s Teriyaki flavor.

Flavorful and tasty. Used this on sirloin strip steak. Wasn't quite as tender as I had hoped, but I could have marinated longer. Will use this one again, though.

I love this marinade.  It tastes just like teriyaki to me.  I am also going to try it for chicken wings. We get together with our neighbors to grill on the weekends where everyone brings their own meat for the grill.  I got a call earlier today to ask if I would stop by to pick up their ribeyes to marinate in my sauce that I use.      thanks for the great recipe.

My husband used our FoodSaver and marinated them in 20 min.
These were the best steaks ever! Better than any steakhouse. Full of flavor and so tender! We are serving them to friends tomorrow night! Can't wait!

Awesome! I had sirloin & marinated it all night. This was so good. I only buy low sodium soy sauce. I didn't know what to think of green onions in a marinade but I decided I love it. The whole family liked it! Thanks.
