Looking over the recipe I knew this had everything a good crab cake recipe should - fresh chives and parsley, egg, mustard, mayonnaise, big chunks of lump crabmeat and, certainly, a minimum of filler (bread crumbs). My only criticism?...  baking these rather than pan sauteing.  I definitely noticed the difference.

My husband loves seafood, and especially crab cakes. He said these were the best he's ever had and I must agree. They are very meaty and light because of the panko and the fact that they are baked and not fried.  I tripled the recipe and had plenty for my family of 6.  I added a few more drops of pepper sauce because we like it with a little more kick.  Beats restaurant crab cakes any day!

Fabulous!  These were the best crab cakes I have ever made.  I didn't change any ingredients, but I did pan fry them in a small amount of butter and canola oil.  I served them with a creamy dijon sauce and dirty rice.  My husband and stepson both loved them, too!

I've tried several crab cake recipes and this is our favorite by far.  I like the fact that they are baked because it fits into the diet a bit easier.  I also use light mayo and they turned out great.

This was delicious!  I've made it twice now and the whole family loves it.  The panko bread crumbs really make them perfect.  Just a couple of notes - I sauteed them, not baked ... I just can't see that working, but maybe I'll try it someday. Second thing - using a 1/4 cup to make the patties, I only get 12 patties, not 18.  These are amazing - terrific recipe!

This was a wonderfully light way to enjoy crab cakes.  I didn't use measurements and omitted the mustard but added Old Bay. I reduced the amount of crumbs by at least half and these were fantastic.

My family has our own version of "Throwdown" and crabcakes were the challenge.  I followed the recipe almost exactly ( I added a little sriracha ) and while I totally enjoyed it, the general conclusion was that if I had not added the extra it would have been perfect.

These are excellent - better than most restaurants.  I followed the recipe almost exact.  The only changes I made were using dried parsley instead of fresh, and using several drops of hot sauce instead of just two.  I served them with Crab Cake Sauce by sal.  Everyone loved them and asked me to make them again the next day.

Loved this recipe. Changed a couple things....fried instead of baked, added a teaspoon of old bay to the mix and let them sit for an hour( which I think was omitted in the original recipe). The first time I made with crab. The second time I made with canned chicken(all I had) and no one knew the difference!

LOVED these crab cakes.  Everyone in my house (even my anti-seafood husband) enjoyed these.  I halved the recipe and used Italian seasoning instead of seafood seasoning.  I have made salmon cakes before and fried them - these were MUCH better baked.  They weren't greasy at all.  I served them on buns with lettuce and tomatoes.  I'll make these a lot in the future!  Thanks to the original poster who shared.  This is a gem!

Way too much breadcrumbs, and as a result it made them crab cake Extremely Dry!!!!!.   I'd cut bread crumbs in half or use them just to cost the outside.

Perfect crab cakes!! Was looking for a recipe like my original but that could be baked instead of fried. Came out great and will definitely be making them again!

Tasty! I made these for dinner tonight and boy were they good. I only made 1/3 of the recipe since I was cooking for 2!  I followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.
