This recipe was quick, easy and tasted excellant ( just like my mother's recipe). I did omit the parsley and pepper. Hint :  using a food processor, do not grind it fine but chop to a grated texture.

These are good, fairly quick to make and use simple ingredients so it is a great weeknight side dish. Squeeze the shredded potatoes in a tea towel to extract as much water out of them as you can so they hold together better and splatter less when cooking.

I cut back on the parsley, as I'm not a fan, I also added 1 cup cheddar cheese into the potatoes.  My oldest son and finace couldn't get enough of them.  I thought they were good for "something different" but will leave the parsley out altogether next time.  I fried mine in a non-stick skillet with about 1/4" of oil and then baked them - great thing is it took the rest of my meal another hour and these weren't dry or overdone!  Thanks for the great idea, I will make these again!

I thought these were wonderful!  This was my first attempt at potato pancakes so I wasn't sure what to expect. I made half with cheese and half without and greatly preferred the ones with cheese.  I also waited until the end to do my seasoning. I will definitely make these again!

I made these tonight since I had a ton of potatoes left over from my holiday cooking. I did not have parsely so I made them without. I used my non-stick griddle, mashed the pancakes out very thin with the sides of 2 forks and cooked them until very crispy. The husband and son ate them as they were done since they do not sit well and become soggy very fast. I ate mine while still cooking several on the griddle. Had them with applesauce and sour cream, maple syrup or cheese and ranch dressing.

These turned out really well.  I think they lacked salt and maybe some flavoring but that is easily adjustable to taste.  These are very easy to make and don't require a lot of time.  My grandmother went crazy for them.  I will make these again but add more salt and some extra spices.

This was my first time making (or eating) potato pancakes and they turned out beautifully. I wasn't sure how to top them so we ate half with ketchup and the other half with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of chives. (Excellent both ways.) Thanks for the recipe!

I thought there was way too much pepper. I would use only 1/4 t next time. The parsley was fine, but I did add the cheddar cheese and it was good!

A nice simple recipe.  I ran out of salt( how does that happen?!) and used celery, and garlic salt instead.  Nice flavor.  You have to soak the potatoes a bit first.  A quick rinse then a good 5 minute soak to release some of the starch, then let drain.  Salt the potatoes while they are draining because it helps release the water and seasons the potato better.  Salt a little more when you mix it all together.  Do a test cake to make sure it tastes right adjust as needed.  Remember the flour and egg are only there to bind it together, not to turn it into a bumpy pancake.  You want to see the potato, and better yet taste it!! Dont be afraid to cook it in grease, and may I suggest cast iron if you have it!!  I'm partial cuz that is how grandma made it!!  thanks for bringing back some memories!!

Use the fine-hole side of the grater (these are NOT hash browns!). We usually don't add parsley and certainly not that much pepper.  Plop in pan and use spoon to spread around and flatten out a bit - should be about 1/4 inch thick.  Now....I'm craving them!

I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to the pancakes, and 1/2 tsp. dried dill instead of the parsley. I only added 1/2 tsp. salt. Used 1 egg and 3 Tablespoons of egg whites [nutri-eggs] instead of 2 eggs. Very good, will make again - better than my old recipe that I had.

Me and my family loved these. I doubled the potatoes and kept every thing else the same.I cheated  a little though,  I bought two bags of fresh grated potatoes [Simply Potatoes]20 oz.each, just to save on time. These taste wounderful with baked pork chops and apples.Yum!

Pretty good, but a little bland. I added flour and some red pepper at least. Don't really need the parsley.

These were very good!!  I added a good handful of shredded cheese, and they stuck together very well.  I am not very adept at getting all the water out, but the taste was wonderful and these were easy to cook.

Thank you so much for this recipe. To say it was terrific would be an understatement. This was my first try at a recipe off of this site and I'm glad it was. I made one small change I omitted the parsely (didn't have any) and added a tiny pinch of garlic powder( I always have garlic) and it was to die for. I will make this for my hubby this weekend and try the parsely, he's gonna be so happy he married me. ;}

My grandmother would grate the potato and onion by hand and squeeze through cheese cloth to remove much liquid (which she would reserve for making potato bread).  This way, she used very little flour and had a high concentration of potato flavor.  On Christmas Eve, we ate these delicious "placki" rolled up with sour cream, with apple sauce, or with baked beans.

Needs more salt and was bland.  Could be a good base for pancakes, but definitely needs to be kicked up a notch.

did not have parsley so didn't add it and didn't miss it at all.  Fried in non stick pan sprayed with Pam, much healthier than oil...very very tasty and will definitely make again! be sure to stir the whole mixture before scooping out to fry.. I noticed my last one was rather peppery as the pepper settled, made it a little hot.  Thanks for a great recipe, I used the food processor, did not rinse but drained potato and onlin real well before adding other ingredients.  Definitely a keeper and I must say better tasting than Perkins potato pancakes!

No problems with this delicious recipe. I chose to grease the pan with olive oil, which was good but I'll try a 1:1 ratio oil:butter in the future. I got delicious pancakes using three cups rinsed frozen hash browns: I bet fresh shredded is better but if you're lazy like me, don't worry, they're good. I look forward to making these again, thanks so much for sharing.

Really great. I didn't have parsley on hand but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Cooked it in a few tbs canola oil. Served immediately with apple sauce and everyone from the one-year old on up loved them.

These were so good.  They seemed to take a long time to cook.  Maybe I didn't have the oil hot enough.  We ate them with sour cream as a side dish to pork roast.  I will be making them again soon.

Great recipe for potato pancakes, I kept the parsley in and I'm glad I did.  I also added a small bit of shredded cheddar cheese and I topped with green onions and sour cream.  These were great as a side dish for pork chops.

My grandmother used to make potato pancases.  When we were growing up and they are my father's favorite food on the planet.  This is a GREAT recipe.  I made using this recipe as a surprise for my dad - who hadn't had potato pancakes in about 15 years!  He was over the moon.  Unlike grandma, though, I believe in the food processor to grate for me!  I found it best to run through the food processor grater two times to  get the potato finer.  Also, I skipped peeling the potatos as well to save time and leave the health benefits.  My polish family gives this recipe five stars with pleasure!

These were good, I followed the directions exactly, did spend some time dabbing the water off the potatoes, though.  The parsely was fine, I like parsely though, but I think it would've been even better to use chives or green onion in place of parsely.  Otherwise they came out really good, seemed to have the right ratio of ingredients.  Also, I always salt and pepper to taste, I think as is this recipe has too much pepper for my taste.
