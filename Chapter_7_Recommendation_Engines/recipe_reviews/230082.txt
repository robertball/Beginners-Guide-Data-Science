I used mini gourmet cucumbers, so I didn’t peel or seed them but, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  Just a little tart for our tastes, but still  yummy.  Next time, I will use milder white balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar and maybe add  just a sprinkle of sugar, if necessary.  I like this salad’s colorful presentation.

This is very good just the way the recipe is written.  I have also made it with sliced green olives instead of capers.  Another time I made it with red wine vinegar instead of the cider vinegar.  Each time delicious! I always do the pinwheel peel (stripes)on the cucumbers because it looks prettier.  :-)

Great basic salad! I made the following modifications: subbed balsamic for cider vinegar, used fresh dill, omitted capers. Light, fresh, and delicious!

Preferred this "cucumber salad" to the ones typically served at my favorite Middle Eastern restaurants. In advance, combined the cider vinegar, olive oil & used FRESH dill which I allowed to   meld. Tossed all veggies including capers and dressed salad upon serving. Paired w/falafel, cucumber sauce and Bethlehem Rice.

I used white balsamic vinegar because that is what I had.  This is a very tasty viniagrette.  It made a nice addition to the 4th of July picnic.  I have already shared it with one of my friends.  She went back for 3 servings.

What a delicious & refreshing dish! Because of dietary restrictions, I eliminated the capers (salt) and used a reduced amount of Safflower oil instead  of Olive Oil. I also used Campari tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes, only because that's what I keep on hand for salads. My husband & I could have this every day & our DIL who has severe Crohn's can enjoy this dish. Love It!

Delicious and refreshing!  I used fresh dill (so doubled the amount), but other than that, I followed the recipe. Will make it again in the future!

A fresh tasty salad that was a hit at the party.
Made it without the capers...Was still tasty.
A great salad for a bar-b-que.

Made as written and it's a very cool and refreshing cucumber salad. I was hesitant to make this salad because of the capers, but ended up adding the full amount called for. Good balance of flavors overall--not too much dill, capers, or vinegar. Will make this again! My only change, as Bookie stated, would be to add more tomatoes--just seemed like a little more was needed.

followed as is and used a combo of apple cider vinegar and white wine vinegar to taste.  Also used fresh dill. Next time, I might forego the capers. Also only used one yellow pepper and used  Persian seedless cucumbers from Trader Joe's

This is a quick and easy salad to make. If you like vinegarette dressings you will fail in love with this recipe. I'm enjoying my salad as we speak. I take some for lunch everyday and everyone wants to know what smells so good! Low calorie, low fat and healthy! That's a win no matter how you look at it!!!
