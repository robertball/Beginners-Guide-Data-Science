I think the chicken turned out well, and the recipe was easy to follow. The final product didn’t look exactly like the professional picture but it was pretty close. No, we didn’t alter or change any of the ingredients but it did turn out good. If I could change anything I would add only half the water we did because it was too wet. The final product looked fresh and good but it was a bit watery. Yes, I would recommend this recipe to others because it was easy to make, fresh and delicious. In fact, I already recommended it to my mom.

This was a wonderful and easy dish! I have always been so intimidated by making Alfredo sauce that I was worried I would screw it up. To my wonderful surprise it turned out so good everyone wanted seconds. Now in my book that is a recipe worth keeping! Only changes I made was I did not have half and half so I used the rest of my heavy cream. I do not use bouillon so instead of bouillon/water mix I use all chicken broth. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was very good and very easy to prepare! I used peas instead of broccoli because my kids won't eat broccoli. I also added 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke. This was enjoyed by everyone...no whining from either of my two girls! Thanks Mazola!

This was fantastic! I left out the chicken but only because I forgot to take it out of the freezer. I added some fresh sliced mushrooms that I sauteed in the Mazola oil along with onion. The alfredo sauce was perfect!

This was a really good meal. My husband was impressed with it as well. I halved the recipe since it was just the two of us but otherwise followed it exactly. Edit: If the sauce is too liquidy for you, just add more cheese until it thickens. Also, I suggest adding extra seasoning for more flavor.

I followed the directions exactly and my sauce came out extremely liquidly. I tried to reduce the sauce for the longest time but I finally gave up since I didn't want my broccoli to turn into mush.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again but if I did I would make the sauce and pasta separate or reduce the amount of liquid.

Final product was way too wet and runny. One qt of water was too much. They should tell you to remove half of the water after your done cooking the noodles.
 I followed it to a T because it was my first time. If I make it again, I'm going to take half the water out before adding the half-and -half milk. It does need more flavor, so I'll add something more the next time.

Easy and very tasty. Not super "cheesy" so if you're looking for a really creamy, cheesy type of dish, this won't be it. Here are the modifications I made: I used a 1 lb box of  thin spaghetti (as it's what I had in the cupboard), increased the liquid/boullion water by just 1/2 cup to accommodate extra pasta.  I used the spoonable bouillon in hot water as I find it more flavorful. I used basil only, not Italian Seasoning, just my personal preference.  Increased parmesan to 1 1/2 cups. Topped servings with crispy bacon and a small amount of extra parmesan. Other than thisI followed the recipe and it was very flavorful and super easy to make. Recommend prepping everything ahead of time to make cooking easier.

This was very easy to make and easy to clean up. I used Chicken Broth instead of the water and Bullion. Other than that I did not change a thing.

Extremely easy, fast and delicious.  And I only had to clean one pot!  Made as written with the exception of chicken broth instead of water and powder.  A definite keeper!!

This came out very good. I mixed around the recipe a bit because it would’ve been way too watered down without doubling the chicken bouillon. Came out a little salty but over all solid dinner and very easy to make

Very tasty and easy to make. Reheated leftovers were even better. I received a lot of compliments on this alfredo sauce, I will definitely use this sauce recipe again. I want to try another reviewer's suggestion to try peas and liquid smoke, I bet it will be a delicious carbonara style sauce. Very pleased with this recipe and with the feedback from my eaters. I recommend this recipe to anyone who uses pre-made alfredo sauce, because it is so easy and delicious!

I loved that I had all ingredients to make this dish & it made hubbie happy. I just used a corn spaghetti pasta since it's gluten free. I also used an asiago Parmesan shredded cheese mix and tasted great!

The recipe was easy, took little time to make, and tasted delicious.  I can tell you that teenagers will love this for sure, despite the broccoli.  :)  I used parppadelle noodles instead of fettuccini, and they were perfect.  Was still fantastic the second day!

Very soupy. Had little to no flavor. My family was so disappointed. You need a really large pan if you don’t want to make a mess.

The flavor was very good. Next time I will start with 2/3 of the water amount. I would like the sauce thicker. Besides that, it was delicious.

My husband enjoyed this quick meal.  I used cream instead of half and half as I was out of half and half.  I needed to add a tablespoon extra cream and just a scant Tablespoon of water just to get it to not be too thick.

Great dinner!  I used broth instead of water and bullion and it worked perfectly.  I did have to boil the mixture a bit longer to get the noodles softer but it was fine.

I made this according to recipe.  Next time I'll use more pepper and leave out the Italian seasoning.  Seemed weird to have an oregano taste in a cream sauce.

This was really good! I didn't have half 'n half so used 2% milk plus some cream cheese that I heated in the microwave (and whisked!) before adding to the pasta. Delish! I didn't mean to deviate from the recipe - I promise. It's a keeper though.

Only changes, based on other reviews, was to reduce the amount of water.  Added it gradually.  Also used penne pasta.

I love the one pot idea. I had penne but no fettuccine so I used that. Also made milk plus butter to make half and half, so not sure if that is why it was so thin, just did some thickening with flour. The whole family loved even the 3 ye old granddaughter. Plenty for all with leftovers for my lunch tomorrow

It was good, but the sauce was very thin.   I couldn't get it to thicken and eventually gave up so that I didn't overcook the broccoli and chicken.

It is great as it is... Even better the next day. I did  on one occasion, add a 1/2 cup of sour cream to give it more of a Romanoff sauce... That was good too. Great with a salad and  toasted garlic bread.

As written the sauce is too watery. With alterations it turn out great. Use 2 cups of water instead of the suggested 4. Add 1 extra teaspoon Italian seasoning and 1/2 cup extra Parmesan.

First let me say, I thought the dish turned out excellent... After some TLC. I substituted the chicken bouillons and water for one quart of chicken broth. Coming close to after letting the chicken, broccoli, and half and half cook off, I noticed the mixture still a bit soupy. After adding the parm, hoping it would thicken up as the recipe describes, I realized it wouldn't. So I added a small amount of roux (flower and melted butter mixed to a pancake batter consistency), about 1/4 of a cup maybe a little less. It thickened right up. I let the roux do its thing for a couple minutes, and dinner was served!

This is the first time I rated any high-rated recipe with a low rating.  If  this were a recipe for creamy chicken broccoli soup then I would probably give it 4 stars.  The only reason I gave it 2 as an alfredo, is because it was palatable.  I followed the directions EXACTLY!  When I ended up with a soupy chicken flavored base I started trying to save it with cornstarch, gruyere...  I don't know how anyone can follow this recipe as-is and not end up with mushy broccoli and dry chicken, first of all.   For me, this was far from an Alfredo and a major disappointment.  My kids pushed it away from the table and wouldn't even try it.  I will NEVER try this again.  Sorry.

I made per the instructions and thought it was very good!

I initially thought it had too much liquid like some of the other reviewers.  However, I took it off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.  It thickened up nicely as the pasta absorbed some of the excess liquid. 

I love that there is not any cream of anything soup in this.  Will make again!

Defiantly cooked fettuccine half way before adding.  I would add less water so it was a little thicker.  I'd also add about a tsp of salt.  Overall, I'd make it again!

One quart of broth plus one cup of half & half is way to much liquid to reduce and absorb for only 8 oz of pasta. Next time I will use 2 cups homemade chicken stock and the 1 cup of half & half. Added a tsp of red pepper flakes for a bit more heat. Taste was good at any rate.

This is a fantastic recipe! I doubled everything because my family is too large for 8 oz of fettuccine, other than that, I followed exactly and it was a huge hit with everyone. I'm definitely going to make this again.

Delicious! So easy to make and stayed nice and creamy w/o drying out. I had heavy cream to use up, so I used that instead of the half & half. The girls' LOVED it, and so did everyone else...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
