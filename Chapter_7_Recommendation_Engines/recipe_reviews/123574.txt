I've been enjoying allrecipes.com for a long time, but this is the first time I've HAD to write a recipe review. This super easy cake recipe is wonderful! My kids can't stay out of it, and my husband (who's not a sweet lover) keeps going back for more! I didn't have any peanuts, but I think I would exclude them anyway. I was generous with the chocolate and peanut butter chips...will probably be even more generous with them the next time. Thanks for the perfect recipe for the items I had in my pantry!

I've made this one a couple times, and it's always a hit.  I made it "as is" initially, and have played with the peanut butter quantity, as well as switching up the chips.  I have one in the oven right now with about 1 1/4 c peanut butter, no peanuts, and I only used chocolate chips (and increased to about 1 1/4 cup).  This is a co-workers birthday cake - she'll LOVE it!!

I did an ingredient search since I had a cake mix that needed to be used and I wanted something with peanut butter.  This was easy to mix together and was ready in no time.  The flavor is good and texture was soft and moist.  Next time I think I'd like to try adding even more peanut butter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake was SOOOOO good! I made it into individual cakes, layered with chocolate mousse in between & iced with chocolate ganache. Delish!

Our 5-year-old nephew absolutely loved this cake.  We left out the peanuts, which probably misses the whole point since there was no "crunch," but to the 5-year-old set, this was the "best, best, best cake ever."  The adults liked it, too.  Would be good even without the chocolate chips, we think.

Made exactly per directions;  I thought it was a bit dry... it was a hit at work though, good peanut butter flavor.

I made this in cupcake form for a baseball themed wedding shower. This represented "salted nuts" and it was a HUGE success! I did not even taste it prior to taking it because I was running late and am not a HUGE PB fan, but so many people continued to want another one I had to ask my friend to split one with me! I topped it with a Peanut butter fluffy frosting from this site and garnished with nuts and chocolate chips tossed in sea salt. I will definitely be making these again!

I haven't even tasted the finished product yet, but I can tell this is going to be something I make again, maybe with some variations to the toppings. My husband loves peanut butter, and he licked the beaters and the bowl, and can't wait for it to get out of the oven because it smells so good. Can't wait to taste it!
Update: this was a huge hit!!
