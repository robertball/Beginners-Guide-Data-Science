This was a lot easier than I thought it would be and fun. I tried this one because it was on AR.   This is very tasty and easy to make if you have a onion slicer (its like an apple one) you just put on onion and push down.  I would recommend trying the ice bath with onion to get to bloom open more.  I got mine to bloom but not quite as much as I had hoped.  You want to make sure your grease is 350 and you want to fry it core down first then flip if your grease does not submerge the whole onion.  DO cook for the 10 Min.. I thought mine was done at 7... but no, its not because it wont peel off to eat if not tender...We had a lot of fun making this.  We only made one and I have left overs for another one.  Dont skip the refrigeration part of the onion.  THE DIP:  Well lets just say you should put everything in the bowl excep the "horsey" and add it 1tsp at  a time to your liking.  I had pure horsradish and my son was making the dip, we ended up doubling everything but the horsey and it was still a little to much for us. Thank you for the recipe. Take a look at my pics and you will see the cutter I am talking about.

This recipe didn't have very much flavor to me at all. Neither the sauce NOR the breading. It turned out okay, just not comparable at all to what you get in restuarants. I had to add lots of spices, hot sauce, etc to get it to taste good.

Wonderful!  I did need more oil to fry the onion in than the recipe called for, but I may have just had a really big onion.  It looked lovely.  I left the room to get my camera, came back and the guys had eaten half of it.  So, sorry, I can't post a picture.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Pretty good. Careful with the horseradish. One tablespoon is MORE than enough. Add more miracle whip if the radish is to strong. Also cook the onion a minute or two longer
