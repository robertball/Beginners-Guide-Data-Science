Instead of the saute express mixture, I used lemon infused olive oil and lemon pepper seasoning. It turned out great. Some of the best fish tacos I've tasted.

Excellent recipe. I used halibut and lemon pepper mix and fried the fish in coconut oil. I then transfer to a pan and finished off in oven for a few minutes. I want to eat these everyday!

Fantastic! I told my husband I was making fish tacos and he thought I was nuts, who would put fish in tacos! He actually said "go ahead I think I will just make a sandwich". When they were done I actually convinced him to try one and he loved them! They are super easy, fast, and packed with great taste. I actually had to make more! I will put this on my regular meal list!

This recipe is very tasty.  The only thing I would change is I will not put the coleslaw and cilantro in the pan with the sauté mix. I will leave them cold and not coated in lemon sauce. It was to lemony when put in shell.

I used the Baja Taco Sauce with this and it was awesome. Also didn't have the lemon pepper seasoning butter so I made my own, still a re-do in our family.

I don't know what saute express is and decided, on the advice of others, to use lemon pepper and butter flavored olive oil. I baked basa filets at 425* until they flaked. I didn't mix the cabbage with the fish but layered everything into 6" tortilla shells with the Fish Taco Sauce recipe from this site. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use battered fish and this is a good base. This recipe is super simple by  baking the fish and I used purchased preshredded cabbage. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I definately would make this again! Made my own lemon pepper for the fish as suggested by other reviewers. Fish turned out perfect! Made hm pico and used sour cream. Only suggestion I would have is be mindful of how you layer it when eating. I used a wrap and first time made the mistake of putting the hot fish on the sour cream. What a mess! Next time I put sour cream, then pico, then cabbage, then fish.. DELICIOUS!! Even tasted good as leftovers!

I used lemon infused olive oil and lemon pepper seasoning as suggested in another comment. It was AMAZING!!! Even my son who is a notoriously picky eater declared it delicious!

Instead of Tilapia I used fresh Halibut.  I also swapped out the saute express with olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning and grilled the fish for more flavor.  Best fish tacos! Would make again.

Best fish taco we've tasted. I prefer it as a wrap, so I use tortilla for it too. Have made this about 20 times already, having it tonight too!

Like another reviewer, I didn’t find that cube either so I used olive oil and lemon pepper and I topped them with taco fish sauce from this site.

Will make again.  I added parsley to the coleslaw mix .  It, and the cilantro, added nice fresh flavour but I will spritz with lemon juice and fry the fish with lemon zest next time.
