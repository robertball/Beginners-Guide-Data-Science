My mother-in-law made these for every holiday with either a beef or pork roast and gravy. She added a package of dry yeast and let the dough rise for about an hour. We made small loaves (about the size of a large hoagie roll) and let them rise for about 1/2 hour. Then, we placed them in boing water (covered pot) and did not lift the cover for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes we turned the dumplings over and cooked for another 10 minutes. When you lift them out, cut with fishing line. These turn out like steamed bread. Lighter than dumplings. We always served them with gravy. They were always the hit of every holiday meal!

I like this recipe very much -- for Lent.  However, I think houskove knedliky should have bacon, onions and butter in the batter! And if one is using a good crusty European bread, remember to remove the crusts when cubing!  Ahh, the heart-warming (and heart-stopping) memories of Aunt Wilhelmina's dumplings with pork shoulder pan drippings and cabbage!

I am on vacation and we decided to make a pork roast and I thought of my recipe for dumplings but wasn't exactly sure of how much of the ingredients to use. Uncle Shaf's receipts was exactly how I make mine at home. GREAT FIND!!!

Tried this, really liked the dumplings. I think the next time I make them I will try potato bread. I made drop dumplings because we are used to a less formal shaped dumpling. Very happy with the results.

My Bohemian mother had us boil (simmer) the dumplings covered (NO PEEKING) for 15 min., then uncover & turn & boil another 5 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon, slice & serve! 
NOTE:  these are excellent to brown in butter the next morning & add to scrambled eggs!  Dumplings can be frozen & served at any time.  Delicious!
