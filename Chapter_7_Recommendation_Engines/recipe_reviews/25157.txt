Great salad - rich with color and flavor! I used half romaine lettuce and half baby spinach as that's what I had on hand. I cut back on the radishes a bit and threw in some homemade croutons. I topped it off with "Simple Sicilian Salad Dressing" from this site. Very good.

Nice green salad. Half of the amount of cucumber and bell peper is needed though.

Great combination of healthy, vibrantly colored salad fixins and perfect with the homemade lemon vinaigrette I already had in the fridge.  GREAT salad to make when your husband who hates feta cheese is out of town!  Loved it.  I just wish I would have thought to add some of those hard boiled Easter eggs I had in the fridge too.  They would have fit with this salad like they were made for it!

This was an awesome salad. Used tomato basil feta and a really nice rasberry viniagerette to top it all off. A+

This is a great salad!  I used regular mixed lettuce and did two lyers  of veggies.  I shredded the fets and it looked great and I got lots of compliments on it.

Thanks!

Perfect combo of veggies and cheese.  I like French feta, it's less salty and smoother then regular feta.

Great - the radish adds a nice punch!  I added carrots and a few other veggies I had on hand.  Used black pepper, balsamic and olive oil as dressing.

As far as this recipe goes, this is an excellent veggie combination. I served it with http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Absolutely-Fabulous-GreekHouse-Dressing/Detail.aspx from this site, which took it to a 5-star recipe with no problem. I chose to post my picture with the dressing recipe, but will also post it to this salad later. Thanks!

This makes a nice healthy salad, I like to use green pepper in place of red pepper.

simple and delicious. This salad goes with just about anything. I made this per the directions but next time I will add black olives and red onion as well.
