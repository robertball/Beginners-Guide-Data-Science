This was easier to prepare than regular lasagne.  If a person loves heat, this is sure to please.  We tend to go with medium heat so next time I make this I'll use 1/2 the cajun seasoning called for.

I made this last night and everyone absolutely loved it. The only change I made was I sprinkled a half cup or so of cheese in each layer to hold it together. Then didnt use as much on the top. I also made my own simple alfredo sauce since I don't like store bought. (that part only takes about 10 minutes).

Wonderful flavor!  The only thing I changed is that I added some mushrooms; a good addition.  The only thing we didn't like is that it fell apart easy.  It wasn't very cohesive so it made it a little harder to serve and eat.  My sausage must not have been that hot because my children were able to eat it and they really enjoyed it.  I would make it again if there was a way to make it more cohesive without changing the flavor or general make of the lasagna.

My husband really likes spicy things, and he said this was the best lasagna he'd ever had.

This is a great and unique lasagna.  I left out the celery and red bell pepper and added extra cheese between the layers to help them stay together.  Next time, I may layer in some ricotta or cottage cheese mixed with garlic and chopped spinach.  Also, I split my lasagna between two eight inch pans and froze one for later.

This was a huge hit with friends. I served it with a light salad and garlic toast. Great flavor blend with just the right spice. I added a bit of ricotta cheese between the layers.

Wow! Way too hot. Next time I'll use summer sausage and only half of the cajun seasoning.
