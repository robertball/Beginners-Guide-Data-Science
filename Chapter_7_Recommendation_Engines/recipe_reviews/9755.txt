Overall, this IS a very yummy treat I will be making over and over again in the future. But I agree that the crust does not hold together well, but I found that by using 1/3 c butter in the crust and another TB of sugar did hold it together perfectly. I would also suggest using small eggs- I think I used Large ones and the topping was a little "omelet-y".

I found that the base did not hold together very well and that it could probably use more butter.  The filling was good just by itself.

These are very easy to make and very delicious. 
For a variety add some cocoa.
We had no problem with the crust falling apart. 
Works well as a double recipe in a 13 x 9 pan as
well

I had to make something for us to take to Sunday brunch and I didn't want to rush out to the store. This fit the bill perfectly! I did take other reviewers advice and used more butter in the crust; it was also salted butter, which I think helped balance the sweet topping with the salty crust. I did not have walnuts, so I used the pecans that I had on hand. All in all, it came out well. Thank you Rayna for sharing this recipe!

I used pecans instead of walnuts, so it was kind of like coconut pecan pie. I increased the butter in the crust to 5 Tbs and it turned out great. I did make a mistake the first time of using sweetened coconut, so it was too sweet for me. I recommend unsweetened. Very yummy recipe.

Quick, easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. I used an 8x11-inch pan, which I sprayed with Pam, and the bars didn't stick at all. Thank you for the recipe!

These turned out good, everyone liked them. I used 5 tbls of butter in the crust and spread it thin in a 9x13 greased pan and it turned out fine. Mine were really sweet I used left over ground walnuts from a nut roll and forgot I added sugar already to it! So the nut kinda carmelized on top. Good, but you could not eat a big piece!

The topping on this recipe is great when you use half the sugar and sweetened coconut.  As for the bottom crust, is was tasteless and crumbly.

Gooey top on a dry, hard, dryish crust. Despite coconut, vanilla is the predominant flavor. Was well liked by colleagues, but cleaning the pan was horrific. Be sure to grease, or line the pan.

these were very bland! I had to frost with chocolate frosting so my family would eat them.  also the mixture of walnuts and coconut was abit odd-tasting. i would never make them again.

I was wanting coconut something. Not enough walnuts in the house , so substituted half with raisins. Turned out just fine, sweet and chewy.
