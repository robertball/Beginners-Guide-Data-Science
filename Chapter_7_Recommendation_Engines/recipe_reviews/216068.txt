Kids love this! I made this for some pre-school kids I was watching, who were learning about gardening one week. I also put it in individual clear plastic cups and layered the cookie crumbs and pudding.

Always a hit. The last time I made this over the weekend I put in a layer of cool-whip in the bottom for something fun and different and I added an extra package of worms too. Ever single person had at least seconds or thirds!

Made for my daughter's Halloween party at her daycare and it went over very well! My daycare provider LOVED this idea and wants to do this each year now! I crushed an entire bag of a store brand sandwich cookie with chocolate filling, which I didn't remove because it really resembled muddy dirt (plus, I liked the consistency it gave). I used individual clear plastic cups, so each of the kids would have their own. I layered the "dirt" first, then a middle layer of pudding, and a final top layer of dirt again. Fun to make and eat, these will continue on as a yearly Halloween tradition!

This was incredibly easy to make and was a huge hit at my friend's son's birthday party. Both kids and adults went back for seconds! I read another suggestion and layered light cool whip, cookie pieces, chocolate pudding, cookies and worms. I'll make this again and again.

It's just fun to say you're eating mud and worms!.  It's a cute and easy dessert but a little bland.  Maybe I'll use a different brand pudding mix next time.

I made an adult version of these last night to take to a halloween party. In place of milk I added 16 oz of Cool Whip 3/4C of Kahlua and 1/4 C of vodka and use a 5.9oz box of pudding. Really good!

I make this for my 3 year old son all the time! He calls it 'dirty pudding', lol, and loves it. The only thing I do differently is portion it into individual serving cups. This is a fun, easy, and tasty recipe for kids AND adults too! :)

Adorable, yummy, and fun for kids and adults!  My husband and I loved it as well.  We used a bigger package instant pudding and added more Oreo crumbs to equal 6 pudding cups.  VERY COOL!

As I did not have enough oreo cookies, I mixed Ritz crackers. It made it look more "dirt".(put the "dirt" only on the top of the pudding)

Simple to make, exactly as recipe says.  While not necessarily to my taste, kids and adults all loved it!  I would increase the number of cookie crumbs listed but that is again strictly by my taste.  I love how easy it is!

I made this for Easter brunch dessert. It was easy enough that I didn't mess it up, and my little niece could help. We decorated it with green edible Easter grass, gummy worms, and candy speckled robin's eggs.  I tripled the recipe, which was really easy.

This recipe is so simple, and is guaranteed to be a hit at your next event! Adults & children alike raved about this sweet treat! You can switch the gummies to any gummy candy to suit your theme, but the worms are so fun & perfect for the "dirt"!

Easy and fun! I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate because I don't like an overload of chocolate. We used the idea from the other dirt pie recipes and used a pot and put in fake flowers.

I made this for my daughter's class Halloween party. Knowing other sugary treats are going to be given to the kids I decided to make this in small (5 ounce ) plastic cups. I doubled the recipe and it made 30 little cups.( see picture )
Following other reviewer's suggestion I got the chocolate crème Oreo cookies, with that kind no need to scrape the filling. Once you crush up the cookies, just separate by had the sticky pieces.
I put 1 rounded tablespoon of the cookie crumbs  in the bottom of all the cups then 1 tablespoon of the pudding that I gently spread around to adhere to the sides of the cups and then another rounded tablespoon of cookie crumbs. The last step was to stick in the gummy worms. The ones I had were gelatin free, ordered  online.
