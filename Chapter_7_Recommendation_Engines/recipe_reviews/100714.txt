I was looking for a recipe similar to my mother's Texas Hash she always made.  This was very close.  My family loved it.  I added about a tablespoon of chili powder, a can of corn and covered it with cheese, put the lid back on and let it melt for about 5 minutes.  It was great with cornbread muffins and fresh fruit salad.

This was good, but I made some changes. I only had ground turkey, so that was a good substitution. I was out of cumin, so I decided I would add 1/2 cup of medium salsa in place of the ketchup. Because of this, I only did half an onion. My peppers were a mix of red, yellow and green that I already had cut up. I did not add the additional salt, but I did up the pepper to 1 tsp. Also, I subbed dried cilantro (2 tsp) and added it when I added the other ingredients. Finally I used brown rice instead of white (didn't have enough white), so the cook time was closer to 50 minutes. I mixed in 1/2 cup of reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese in the last 5 minutes. Overall, easy and tasty.

Very tasty but I did make a few changes.  I added some miced garlic while browning the beef & onion.  Also added a can of dark red kidney beans (with liquid) & increased the water slightly to ensure the rice cooked properly.

We loved this!  I will definately keep the ingredients on hand for a fast comforting supper.  My 4yo who doesn't eat anything even liked it.

excellent easy weeknight supper, didn't have the cilantro but still very tasty, will definitely make again, melted cheddar on top and a dollop of sour cream.
