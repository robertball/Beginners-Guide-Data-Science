My wife, daughter, and I loved it.  I followed the recipe exact.  It was a little thin in the end so I added a little cornstarch.  I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. I added diced jalopenos, crawfish and I cooked my shrimp in crab boil for 2 minutes then 2 minutes in the simmering chowder.

I made it and it was pretty darn good. I did add sea scallops quartered as well as the shrimp.  I served it with corn bread. I will definitely make it again.

12.21.17  Super easy and tasty chowder.  Unlike chowder, it was a bit on the thin side, so I will thicken in the future with a cornstarch slurry.  I have only additional comment, and that relates to the number of servings.  I scaled this recipe down to two servings, and there really wasn’t enough chowder for two entree-size dinner servings (and we don’t eat huge portions)...just my opinion.  As written, I will consider this recipe as a first course/appetizer-size portion, or if I want to make a meal out of it with soup or salad, I’ll simply make more.  Lately, been trying to pay more attention to my carbs and cholesterol, so this was a treat, and a really good one!  john zelahy, thanks for sharing your recipe.
