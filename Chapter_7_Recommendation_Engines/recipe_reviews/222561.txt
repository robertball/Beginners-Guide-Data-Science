I went out and bought fresh radishes specifically for this salad. I only added some fresh ground pepper, no other changes. I made this when I got home from the store this morning and left it in the fridge for a couple hours before I scooped some out and ate it for lunch. This is the tastiest way I've eaten radishes, pretty much EVER. This salad is incredible. I'm about to go fix another bowl it's so good. WOW!

I over planted this year and had about 10 lbs of radishes from my garden to use. Just came across this recipe and it is so good! I left out the white sugar, but made no other changes. This was simple and a great alternative to just throwing radishes into a tossed salad. Thanks for sharing!

Even the people who said they didn't like radishes ate it and liked it.  Had green onions from the garden and used those in place of the red onion.  Turned out great and it was all gone by the end of the evening.

Made this last night and loved it. I omitted the sugar (I just forgot actually), and used dried dill instead of fresh (for converting to dried herbs, remember the baseline of 1 TBSP fresh = 1 TSP dried), and it was quite the nice accent. I imagine the vegetable selections are exchangeable, but I prefer to eat vegetables that I normally don't (the radish!), and this combo of flavours works well. Leaving it to set is also definitely important - I taste tested multiple times during the hour, and it was definitely better the longer it sat. Will make this again, esp. in the summer.

I had really high hopes for this salad but I have to disagree with al the people saying it was really good. Honestly all I could taste was olive oil. The "dressing" was olive oil with a hint of vinegar. I literally couldn't eat it. I might as well have been drinking olive oil out of the bottle. I think however if you made the dressing actually a vinaigrette instead of olive oil then this would be decent. I would also cut back on the onions as red onions are very strong and maybe add more cucumber. Also in terms of quantity there was just too much dressing compared to the ingredients. They were swimming in it.

Excellent.  A different (to me) way to use a couple of summer favorites.  I had my chopper out, so I used it to cut the radishes and cukes into a small dice.  Next time I'll use a larger dice because the small dice turned out more like a veggie salsa.  Tasty and healthy.  The fat grams in the nutrition data are way overstated.  The recipe calls for 4 teaspoons of olive oil per serving which is 18+ fat grams per serving.  So if you serve this dish with a slotted spoon, you won't be eating that full amount of the dressing.

Yum! Different and refreshing. The dill is a nice touch.  I subbed 1 tbs applesauce and 1 tbs orange juice instead of adding sugar, and also added chopped celery. Excellent way to mix up the menu and looks great on the table!

I liked it. It's not something I would want to eat all the time, but there's nothing wrong with the salad, I'm just not THAT into radishes. There wasn't anything I thought of changing though. Thanks for the recipe.

The ratio of oil to vinegar is way off on this dish.  And it needs more seasoning with salt.  I added white balsamic vinegar to make the ratio to oil almost equal plus more salt and it is good! I love using the radishes with the cucumbers and onions.

A very nice way to use the radishes I got in my CSA basket. I am not a huge fan of radishes, but my husband is. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked this. Hubby loved it, of course. We enjoyed it 2 days in a row tossed with salad greens and leftover cooked chicken for some very satisfying lunches. With just the 2 of us taking a few days to eat through this, it did get soggy and ugly in the fridge, but it still tasted yummy, and mixing it with the salad greens helped maintain the fresh crunchy texture. Will make again when I receive radishes in my CSA. Otherwise, I don't really go out of my way to buy radishes. Thanks for helping me find a way to enjoy them!

My husband said "Radishes are a garnish, this should not be a recipe".  I liked it okay, but it isn't a remake for me.  If you LOVE radishes, go for it.

Big favorite with a slight modification.  The first time I tried this, I substituted green onion for the red as was out of red and no dill as was out of that too. I think it is better with green onion, and I prepared it both ways, sometimes with both red and green onion.  It is fine with or without dill.  I love this recipe so much am making it about once a week.  When I bring leftovers for work lunch, I add a little cooked Quinoa until it seems "right, and it's just perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Usually I love radishes and all of the ingredients in this dish.  But when combined this was just a "meh" for our family.  Missing something and the leftovers were too "pickled" to be much good.

Maybe because my radishes were past prime and getting very large in the garden, or maybe because i didn't let it sit in the fridge for an hour, I found this to be pretty blah.  I"ll try again with doing exactly as instructed ( because I have way too many radishes in the garden still)

Good but, 1/2 cup is too much. So is the garlic. Perhaps my one clove was too large, but it over powered the extra dill I added. Suggest only 1/2 teaspoon garlic and double the dill.

This was really good, different and refreshing.  I did decrease the olive oil to about 1/3 cup and used dried dill weed because that's all I had but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Had a few white icicle radishes (HOT) that my neighbor had given me that I added in with regular red ones.  That really added some heat to the salad.  Will definitely make again!

Mmm mm scrumptious and refreshing.  Had some really large radishes that were also very hot.  I looked up radish salad and this recipe came up.  Nice light dressing which overall tempered the radishes.  I didn't have dill and neither did I have red onion - I used a sweet onion in place of it.  I'll be making this salad again - probably tomorrow as I have more of those radishes to use up;-)

We acquired some fresh white and red radishes from a friend.  My husband whipped up this salad up and it was delicious.  Flavors blend well together. I'm not a big fan of the radish, but I really enjoyed this salad!

This is the most basic way you can make the salad. I would advise squeezing half of a lemon juice, a pinch of fresh garlic, sea salt and pepper, sub the sugar for honey...it’s DELISH that way. No need for olive oil ... just the cider vinegar is fine.

We loved this!  It was quick, easy & fresh tasting.  We served it on some Boston Bibb lettuce and just used the dressing on the lettuce.   Later in the evening, a piece of toast spread with cream cheese and the salad piled high on top and heavily peppered.  I can hardly wait to eat more!

Just the flavor I was looking for, but it needed about one teaspoon of sour cream. (I used non-dairy kind.)

Three stars because of the dressing.  I like the mix of radishes, cucumber and onion.  The problem is with the dressing.  I agree with another reviewer that the oil/vinegar mix is off. I made the dressing on the side (according to the directions) and taste tested it  with a cucumber, only to realize it was way to oily.  I then doubled the vinegar, which was an improvement.  I will make this recipe again but try it with a different dressing, probably the Dill Vinaigrette by Rinnie from this site.

Had to give this one 5 stars because I could find nothing wrong with it!  I made it exactly as it was written with the exception  I had lots of fresh dill from the garden so was generous with the dill.  Probably doubled the dill.  At the table, I put on fresh ground pepper because I love pepper on everything.   I might add some sliced celery also next time just to try it out.   And as one person said, the left-over dressing would go well on another type of salad.   A nice refreshing summer salad.

Followed the recipe pretty close.  Didn't have fresh dill, used dry.  Had a whole bunch of radishes to use from my garden so the radish and cucumber was probably doubled.  Made the dressing following the recipe.  Next time I make this I will  cut back the olive oil to half.

Agree with others who have already stated -- the dressing is what kills this recipe. WAY too much EVOO, not enough flavor.  It helped a little bit to let it sit and eat it later, maybe that's the trick... but honestly I wished I had listened to my gut as I measured the oil...("really? a half cup?!"). Couldn't taste any dill at all. I wish that I had done a creamy dressing recipe instead.

This was an easy recipe and was really liked by the crew that tasted it today at our office potluck. They liked the crunchiness and flavors. I did add a can of sliced chestnuts and some lemon pepper.  I doubled the recipe but not the oil.

We liked it. I used the opportunity to add in other left over raw veggies that needed to be used, like broccoli. It was fine. I added more vinegar& lemon juice per our tastes & just a very little honey.

Have made this a dozen times and it's always a winner.  I just use garlic powder.  Only time it came out poorly was when I brought home some high test strong onions.

I made it exactly as outlined except I used dried dill from a container that I just opened instead of fresh dill.

I like the idea for this salad but this is a poor recipe and here are the reasons why;

1) Way to oily.  Next time I will cut the oil in half then add a little more if I feel it needs it.

2) Way to oniony.  Next time I'll use half a cup onions instead of a whole cup.

3) To little cucumber.  Next time I'll use double the cucumber because radishes just don't have a lot of flavour or crunchy texture.

And next time I will add a touch more salt and a touch less sugar because I prefer my salads to be sour, not sweet.

I would give this 3.75 stars if I was able to with this rating system.  What I liked about this salad was...it was different, fresh and "summer".  What I didn't like about it was the olive oil...I think it would have been better with vegetable oil instead.  As far as someone saying it was too salty, you need to rinse the salt off of the radishes before adding them to the other vegetables.  I didn't have red onion, so I used a combination of yellow onion and green (scallion) onions.  I think it would have tasted best with sweet onion.  I think with some tweaking, this recipe could be made better.  I may try it again someday when I have radishes...not something I usually keep on hand.

A very nice salad, and a great use of our fresh garden produce.  I think the next time I would cut back on the dressing, or drain any excess off before serving.  I will make this again.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used green onions in place of the red onion.  The mix of veggies was awesome but the dressing was not to our liking --too salty, it seemed.  I added more sugar and it was OK but my hubby was not a fan.  I'll try the veggies again but will have to find a different dressing.

Excellent!  The radishes lose a lot of their bite after marinating.  Even my husband who isn't fond of radishes enjoyed this.  Made exactly as directed, except had to substitute rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar because I was out.

I had some fresh radishes to use up.  I really enjoyed this salad. I went a little heavier on the vinegar and used unseasoned rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and a little lighter on the olive oil. I also salted both the radishes and the cukes together.  Added a bit of fresh ground black pepper at the end.

I am in the process of incorporating more vegan dishes in to my diet. This is perfect! It's a great addition to a meal, is low cost to make, and doesn't have to be just a summer salad. The only change I will do is to reduce the amount of sugar, but that is my preference only. This radish salad will definitely be included in meals going forward.

Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of it, but that is probably because I don't like radishes. My husband however, loved it. Which I was REALLY surprised because he's not all that big into new or different dishes. Will keep this in mind next time I have too many garden radishes :)
