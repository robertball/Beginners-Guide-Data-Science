Awesome flavor and texture.  This doesn't need fancy spices and a lot of complicated steps; it's easy and delicious.  However, if you want to add extra spices, I found that mustard powder, garlic, and/or a sprinkle of nutmeg worked well with the potato and leek flavors.  We also ate it with a toasted piece of sourdough bread (yum!)
I'd also suggest adding the milk directly into the bowl.  That way each person can control the soup's consistency to their preference, and I didn't have to worry that the soup had milk in it that might spoil if I left it out for a couple hours or if it took more than a week to finish (which it did).
I think we used more potatoes than were called for; we didn't have red potatoes so we had to guess but we used up the last of our baking potatoes (6 of them).    It made enough for 2 people to eat for a week.

This recipe was quite easy to make.  I substituted Yukon Gold Potatoes for colour and a dash of cumin to kick in some flavour.  Although its been rated as boring, I think you're best to season it to your own taste.  Get creative, not critical!

I made it as directed, and it was a bit bland.  Then I tried the suggestion that it "can be made even better with the addition of crumbled bacon".  It sure can!

For veggies & vegans, you can do this quite well using veggie broth for the chicken & subbing soy milk.

I added a cut up ham steak and one of the cans of broth I used was garlic-flavored.  It added a lot of flavor.  I'd recommend adding garlic either when you saute the leeks or using garlic broth for extra flavor.  Excellent soup, and filling!

Very tasty.  Unfortunately my kids didn't appreciate it as much.  My husband loved it and so did I.  Hit the spot on a cold, winter day.

To increase nutritional value, don't peel potatoes. Chop then boil directly in chicken broth. You're peeling off most of the vitamins and pouring the rest down the sink with the water otherwise!

I used yukon gold potatoes and boiled in a "gourmet" box of chicken broth that had white wine and thyme in it (College Inn was the brand name). We topped it with a bit of mozzarella/provolone cheese when we served it. Yowza! So simple and so amazingly good!! My six year old loves it!

Fantastic recipe - the closest I've come to the amazing soup I remember from the Coffee House and Tea Room in St. Andrews, Scotland, where I often had this soup as my lunch. Did as the suggestion offered, and added the crumbled bacon, also sauteeing my leeks and added fresh mushrooms in the bacon leavings - but making sure the leeks were still a bit crisp. Boiled the potatoes, leeks, and mushrooms in the broth for about twenty-five minutes (with the bacon crumbles) and then after adding the milk and portioning out the soup, sprinkled a bit of shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese and some asiago over top. Soup needs very little seasoning (seasoned the leeks and mushrooms with a bit of garlic, cumin, and pepper) and is tasty and filling.

I've followed a few potato leek soup recipes, but i think this one is a favorite. I did make a few changes. I sauteed three chopped leek bunches in butter and garlic for about 5 minutes before adding the broth and peeled russet potatoes. While the potatoes were boiling, I melted butter and flour in a separate pan before adding milk to thicken it. I then added the milk mixture to the soup and let continue to cook. I then "hand mashed" the soup (I usually use a hand blender) and the soup came out perfect! Soup is hearty and tasty! Great for a cold rainy day!

Very yummy!  For a one pot variation, cook your potatoes in a 3-4 qt stock pot, remove them and drain.  Then cook some bacon in the same pot until crispy, remove the bacon and some of the grease.  Add butter and leeks, then broth and potatoes.  Put crumbled bacon on top when serving.

It was good, but a bit bland for my taste. So the second time I made it, I cooked bacon and crumbled it into the soup.  I will also be adding some heavy cream next time to make it a bit creamier.  It was really good though and my kids loved it!

I boiled peeled and cubed yukon gold potatoes in the chicken broth enhanced with garlic instead of using smaller potatoes and extra steps.  The soup made a very filling meal.

Easy recipe and great tasting.  I used new red potatoes and left skins on.  I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup low fat milk. Added some Season All in place of salt.  Garnished with shredded sharp
cheddar.

I used a couple different kinds of potatoes cause that's what I had, but this was amazing! This was my first time making potato soup and I've never had leeks so I was a little weary, but so worth it!!  I added bacon bits which only made this better!!

We love this soup! I make it with a few changes though... I like the flavor of the skin (plus it's added nutrients) so I chop the potatoes to bite size pieces and go ahead boil them in the chicken or veggie stock until they're tender. I then add the sauteed leeks. I also add fresh garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper for a little kick plus whatever other spices I'm in the mood for. I also think it's best to let people add the milk themselves once served.

Definetly a simple good soup. I added bacon the first time I made it, the second time I added clams and bacon. It was good both ways.

Peeling the hot potatoes proved difficult. The soup was a bit on the bland side, but I suppose easily adapted with some more seasonings if desired.

This soup was wonderful. I did add a little garlic powder, white wine, and cauliflower puree for some added flavors. I also used Yukon gold potatoes and left the skins on. After dishing it out, I topped my bowl with a little cheddar cheese and some red pepper flakes. Delicious!

Tasty enough, I guess I wanted it to be just a tad thicker for my tastes and if I make this again I think I will maybe add some bacon for flavor and color.  Good enough to eat! :)

I really enjoyed the soup (and my first taste of leek). I will definitely try it again, maybe in the winter with ham to make it a hearty meal:)

It is a very good but I agree it is a tad bland.  Next time I am going to try it with garlic and ham as suggested.  Looking forward to it!

Very easy and hearty recipe! I added 1 large carrot [shredded] and some bacon bits as well. I used light cream instead of milk, but I think this recipe could go without the milk altogether ... Very good!

I followed this recipe but sort of did my own thing and it was delicious 

2 bunches of leeks sauteed in pot with 3 TBS butter salt and pepper

after 25 mins of sauteeing, then blend till creamy.

4 cups water with boullion chicken base mixed in

8 small-med red potatos boiled , used half to puree and half to add to soup

also added 4 cloves garlic, 4 tbsp parsley flakes

IT was really delicious thanks to all the leeks I added.

I cut the amount of broth to 3 cups, substituted light cream for the milk and put the whole mixture in the blender on "puree" for approximately 15 seconds- subtle yet flavorful.

Very tasty.  I put the whole leek in there which made it greener and chewier but very good.  Also mixed in some bacon bits.  Makes a LOT of soup.

Easy to make! I substituted the red potatoes for a mix of purple red and gold mini potatoes and didn't skin them. It was good on its own but I added some ham and thicken it up and it turned out amazing!! It goes REALLY REALLY well with an irish soda bread, it soaks up all the yummy flavors and tastes extra good! Even my 10 month old loves it and i have a hard time feeding her anything besides breast milk.  
Will definitely keep this in my go to book!

I cut but don't peel the potatoes.  I  cook it in the broth, and include the green parts of the leeks--I can't imagine leaving those out. You can use other types of potatoes, but you get a different consistency due to different starch levels. It doesn't need more than salt and pepper, but a little lovage can go a long way in this if you have any. I totally recommend it!  I also use cream instead of milk, but milk will do in a pinch. Also.. why does everyone keep insisting on blending potato soup?? Just because you can doesn't mean you should. It should be chunks of potatoes and leeks. Eat it with bread and butter.

Don't know what went wrong here but it was pretty watery with not a lot of taste even though I added a couple of minced garlic cloves and small minced onion.  Will pick up some Yukon gold tomorrow and puree it into the soup to thicken it up.

This was pretty tasty.  I like a "thicker" soup and it was a little thin.  That was my only complaint.  One thing I did different was I sauteed chopped up bacon with the leeks.  It gave the soup a little bit of smokey flavor.

I LOVED this soup, although I made a few adjustments to the recipe.  I cooked the potatoes in the chicken broth, and left the skins on the potatoes.  When it was cooked I blended the soup and added about 1/4 cup of flour so it would be a bit thicker.  It made a lot of soup and only lasted 2 days! Everyone loved it.

The flavor of the soup was a little bland so I added some garlic and a few other spices which really added a great flavor!  Also, I thought the soup was a bit runny. I was hoping for more of a creamy soup so the next time I make it, I'll be substituting heavy cream for the milk and I will be using less chicken broth as well.

Fabulous!  I used also a little ham from the leftover bone I had in the freezer, sauteed the leeks and garlic before adding the chicken broth and potatoes..whisked it up a bit to thicken it and added a cup of light cream.  Wow!  The kids put shredded cheese on top and ate it up!

pretty bland tasting soup. I used salt free chicken broth instead of the regular.  Added a bay leaf (to increase the tasty) , non fat milk to lower the fat content...I may have made this soup bland by not completely following the instructions, but yea...

Great potato soup.  It tastes better if you blend the entire soup so the leeks and potatoes blend right into the soup.  It also thickens it up.  Top with freshly shredded parmesan cheese!!

I really enjoyed this recipe once I jazzed it up a bit.  It was pretty bland to me.  I cut the potatoes to bite sized pieces and left the skins on. It took less time to cook that way. I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I added potato flakes to thicken. I added bacon. I added garlic salt and a Pampered Chef blend of garlic and crushed peppercorn.  VERY flavorful, VERY rich soup. Family loved it with homemade potato bread.

I have to say that I had every intention of following this recipe to the absolute letter, I couldn't do it. It wasn't because I have to change everything or didn't want too. It was because I didn't have enough leeks and didn't want to go to the store, lol! The orginal recipe looked quite yummy. I only had 1 leek so I used that along with a stalk of celery and a snack bag of carrots. I sauteed them altogether in the butter and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I also diced up thick cut bacon and made bits. I served that FANTASTIC soup with the bacon bits and shredded cheese and drop bisquits! Thank you for the great recipe!!

I made this soup today. It was delicious! I made a few changes.
I used caribow broth instead of chicken. (We live in Alaska so we have access to moose and reindeer ). When i sauted the leeks I added a clove of garlic and a  couple of chopped up reindeer hot dogs for flavor. I mashed potatoes in the pot with a hand masher to make it chunky. And instead of adding milk to the pot I added some into my bowl individually. My husband doesn't like milk. It turned out great!

This recipe sounded good, but came out extremely liquidy and not very creamy.  I didn't want to blend the soup so I tried mashing some of the potatoes to increase the consistency to no avail.  It also lacked flavor.  I added various spices and even tried adding cheddar cheese to the soup and it still lacked flavor.

Good recipe but not very flavourful. I tried like hell to give it a kick but short of tobasco sauce [which I didn't think would be such a good idea] the soup rejected my attempts! 

Oh well, the boyfriend liked it!

Delicious and easy to make.  Dressy enough for company.  I love the subtle leek and potato flavors.  Hearty yet elegant.  I whisked in a bit of sour cream upon serving--tastes great--but fine without.  You can cut down on the liquids as you like to make a thicker or thinner broth.  Definitely a keeper.

so....my boyfriend think it deserves 3 stars instead....
he thinks it lacks spices....and wants to add a tsp of sour cream and bacon bits- per each bowl.
thats him.

but for me.....
i made it without much milk at all....just a bit at the end.  i used a bit of chardonay in the broth....and i used 4 leeks- i love leeks.
overall i really dug this soup, and ill totally make more.
yum.

Loved it. Added about a teaspoon of paprika and a teaspoon of cumin, as others noted they have done. Also used a little "better than bouillon" since I was running low on chicken broth. The better than bouillon is nice because it's got a couple nice little flavors built into it which usually help out whatever you add it to. Finally, I fried up two pieces of bacon and cut them into small pieces, adding them during the simmering phase. 

I usually try to keep my recipes low-lactose, so I used a 50/50 butter spread mix for the sautéing. And at the end of cooking, the soup tasted so good I skipped on the milk entirely. Would probably be very delish with it, but I didn't find the soup lacking at all without it.

Was good as a base. Added chopped ham and heavy cream. Next time will use whole milk and use more butter and cut back on chicken broth since it had a thin consistency.

I made the recipe as stated it was very delish! However, next time I make it I will use less liquid as I found it to be too thin. Otherwise its a keeper! :)

I enjoyed this recipe even though it wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but I'll add some flour and cook uncovered next time.  I used ~5 medium sized Yukon gold potatoes, cubed with skins and cooked in reduced-sodium chicken broth.  Sauteed 2 cloves of garlic (minced) in butter, then added the leeks and followed recipe using 1/2 cup cream (10%).  Because it wasn't very thick, we ended up stirring in some cooked white rice which thickened it up and made it quite a bit more substantial! May have to try this recipe with some white and wild rice or barley

This was a very simple recipe and it was great because I only had limited ingredients at home so to make this with milk and not heavy cream was nice (and nicer for my figure)
However, it was a tad bland but I added a dash of onion powder, and Herbs De Prevonce and it was delish!!

I just made this soup now, and, have to say it's sooo simple and easy to make.  I did make a couple of changes to boost the flavour as I noted that people said it was bland.  I peeled and diced potatoes and boiled in the chicken stock.  I added some white wine, celery seed and garlic to the butter to saute the leeks.  I pureed the soup without any milk and the consistency was just perfect.  Will make this again for sure.

Yummy. Added the crumbled bacon and 3/4 of a cup of some leftover chicken breast.  Sauteed 3 slices of pre cooked bacon along with the leeks, and a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Would be good with some corn too.  I'll make again.

Just made this soup.  Was really good but I found the broth a little thin.  I added about a 1/2 cup of Idoahoan premium potato flakes.  It thickened the broth just enough.  Now it is delicious.

SO easy and SO good! I was out of milk, so I used half and half, but no other changes, as I had both small red potatoes and small leeks from the garden.

Amazingly simple, yet delicious.  The were were a couple slight modifications. Red potatoes were peeled and cubed, then cooked. Leeks were cooked with the butter, a teaspoon of olive oil to keep from burning, and one clove of garlic, crushed. Milk was left out and available for each person to add as desired.  Since I cannot have milk, I just left it out of my bowl and flavor was still amazing!

Very good--Elliot loved it. Changes: After cooking, blend the contents for a bit in blender or a nice texture. Elliot would then like to try adding tender carrots and peas along with some clams after the blending. Even better the next day.

I love leeks!  My mom makes a soup similar to this, and the leeks make it so yummy.  I also like it a little thicker, so I mash up some of the potatoes to give the broth a thicker consistency.  I'm sure my mom's recipe involves cream too, but I'm glad to have a lower-fat recipe.

A nice and simple recipe for my first soup.  I've never made my own soup before but this was a fairly easy recipe to follow.  I halved the amount of everything and it still turned out to be a lot.  Oh, I added some chopped mushrooms as well.  I wish I had bacon to add, because it seemed like it would have added a lot of flavor to this simple soup, but it was still yummy and I'm glad I tried it!

Very tasty! I reduced the chicken broth to 4 cups and seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, parsley and nutmeg. It was delish this way, but I will make it again and try adding some ham or bacon. Yummy in my tummy!

Excellent soup and it warms over well for leftovers!  I used leeks and regular onion and also added large ham chunks!  A great soup for a cold day.

Delicious.  I used less potatoes and kept it (relatively) healthy by using 1% milk instead of something heavier.  Will definitely make again.  I wouldn't serve this with meat or something heavy - keep it light with a salad and some crusty bread.

Very bland even with adding the bacon.  Basically this is a runny potato soup. If you are going to try this, I would recommend cutting up the potatoes and then cooking to allow proper consistency.

Very good soup to start with - then we added crisp turkey bacon, peppercorn seasoning, nutmeg & some garlic salt.  OH YUMMY it was good!
