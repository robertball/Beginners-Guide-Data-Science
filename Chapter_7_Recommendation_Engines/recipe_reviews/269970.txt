When I first saw this recipe I knew it would be a 1 Star recipe- or so I thought. I was wanting to turn up my nose because of the turnips. Imagine my surprise when I tried this recipe without changing ANYTHING (other than serving size) and I liked it! Who knew a grown adult could like turnips in a stew and not miss the potatoes!

Just made it tonight...was loved by entire family including 2 year old and 1 year old! Made with potatoes instead of turnips, added beef broth instead of water and used a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Served with white rices. Only thing came out more like a soup than stew. But we all love soup so that was not a problem. Delicious and easy, will definitely make again soon.
