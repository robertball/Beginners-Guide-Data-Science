I couldn't agree more with other reviewers who suggested this is perfect as is, although I just simply added a dab of butter. Hubby and I really enjoyed this pleasant and delicately herb-enhanced variation of simple white rice. Note: As I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, I was going to throw the little that was left down the disposal. Hubs stopped me in my tracks and told me not to, even tho' there wasn't even enough for another meal! That spoke volumes to me...

This was such a good idea!  I substituted 1/2 t. each of Basil, Rosemary, Thyme and Marjoram because that's what I had on hand.  Great!

Easy & tasty rice dish.  Instead of herbes de Provence, I used sage, thyme, basil, & rosemary.  I threw it all into my rice cooker and it came out delicious.

after this was cooked i added 1 cup parmesan cheese and some sauteed shallots and diced garlic... really really good.  excellent recipe and i didn't feel the chicken stock or the herbs were overpowering... depends on personal preferences i guess.  i like flavorful rice dishes.

Good flavor.  Easily made vegan with vegetable bouillon and it was pretty good.  Next time I'll be trying it with different spices.

This was a good, quick side dish & a nice change from plain old steamed rice.  Since my jasmine rice calls for 1 1/2 cups water for every cup of rice, I used that same proportion of chicken broth instead of the 2 cups called for.  It was perfect.  Very flavorful & went well with our Garlic Chicken dinner.  Thank you for the recipe!

We weren't big fans of this dish.  I found that the flavour of the chicken broth really over-powered the delicate flavour of the herbs.  I might try this again using vegetable broth - or even half chicken broth and half water.

Omigosh, this stuff is awesome! I am soooo addicted. I have been waiting for quite some time to try this, and I finally did, it is simply wonderful I didn't have any regular rice, so I used Jasmine instead. It was a little too much liquid for the jasmine variety of rice so it was a little overcooked, but absolutely delicious. Jennifer, I can't thank you enough for this new favorite!

Added 1tsp Better Than Bouillon (chicken flavor), a couple of splashes of chardonnay, and a small pat of butter.  Thanks for the great recipe, Jennifer!

I was looking for some way to make rice that was more flavorful than the plain white rice I always make.  My hubby loves rice and will eat it with every meal but I'm not so sold on it.  This recipe changed that!  I made this and really liked it.  The only change I made was I added about a tablespoonful of butter.  I put everything in my rice cooker as I normally do and it was excellent.  I'll be making this one often.  Thanks, Jennifer, for a really good recipe.

Good side dish. For those that don't have Herbes De Prevence, you can search Allrecipes and make your own.

An easy, elegeant, flavorful twist on rice. I loved the touch that the fresh herbs added to simple white rice. This is a no fail recipe if followed to a "T." There is no adjustments needed or adding to this rice dish. It's good as is. The preparation time is approximate, cooking time is exact using 1 cup rice and 2 cup chicken stock ratio. sometimes I just put everything in the rice cooker and let it cook until done (20 mins). I served this with "roast chicken with rosemary", and herbed mushroom in white wine," also on this website. Was a perfect compliment to each other. this rice dish is a keeper in my recipe box.

OMG....this was soooooo good!  The balance of flavors was just right.  I think next time I will add some rotisserie chicken to the rice after it is done.  Along with some roasted veggies (tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper and herbs de provence) and you have a quick and tasty weeknight meal.

Made this for Christmas dinner to pair with poached salmon.  Really easy and delicious.  My kids enjoy it, and now ask for me to make it frequently.  Anytime tweens want something besides junk food, it must be great.

Delicious, and so adaptable! Just great. Be sure you use a fairly fresh bottle of herbs; if they're old, the whole dish will taste musty.

I make this often with minute rice.  Very good.  Sometimes instead of chicken broth I will just use butter.  Still a great flavor and an easy way to jazz up plain rice.

Great dish!  Very flavorful and would not change anything, except to note if you use a sodium-free (or low sodium), you might need to add more salt.  This works great for brown rice as well.

I made this as-is, using a homemade blend of 'hdp'. I agree a dab of butter is a nice addition, unless you do what I did which was combining this with the final result of "Spinach Saute" (from AR)that made the ultimate side dish for fish, or even an herb-y/lemon-y chicken.

Wonderfully easy in the rice maker. I used another reviewers suggestion of 1/2 tesp of sage, basil, marjoram and thyme. Also put in a pat of butter. Definitely a keeper.

okay but Herbes de Provence is even better on small,  white potatoes sauteed a bit in butter and the seasoning.

Simple and Delicious! Used one 14 oz can of low sodium chicken broth, so added a little water to make it two cups. Will use this recipe again and again!

Wow, this is great rice!  I used brown rice, water, and 2 chicken bullion cubes.  I thought that 1.5 tsp didn't look like much, so I used 2 tsp of herbes de Provence.  I think it had great flavor.  Went wonderfully with Herb-Roasted Games Hens (recipe from this site) and glazed carrots.

This went wonderfully with our chicken!  Since I used 'Better Than Bouillon', chicken flavored instead of broth I didn't add any salt.  Will make this often!

A quick way to jazz up some plain rice.  Made some for my daughter and she asked for the recipe as she and her kids loved it.

Best rice recipe I've tried. Just perfect as is, or with a a more generous dose of the herbs and a pat of butter. Can't go wrong with this one!

I used veggie broth to make it vegan. It was a quick and easy way to add some taste to plain rice. I also cooked the rice and herbs in a rice cooker.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight along with fish and brocolli. This rice was excellent. I will make this again and again. I used instant brown rice and added about 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese to this. This was excellent.

I used brown rice for this. The flavors are awesome but I found it to be a tad salty. I definitely will try it again omitting the salt. SJS9

mmm PERFECT ! I only come on to do ratings if something stands out..this definitely DID...didnt change a thing, made AS IS, but did take another reviewers advice and added a tablespoon of butter at the end. Its so simple but with the chicken stock and herbs, it was so much more flavorful than just water and rice...and the smell is divine...served with chicken and broccoli. DELICIOUS !

worked great for me and i even substituted brown rice, cooking 30 min, allowing to sit 5 min after turning the burner off.  i added (of COURSE, can't leave anything alone) sauted mr's and celery and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  pretty tasty.

Love how it's simple and fast. Will make again and again. I used 3/4 chicken boullion and 2c water for the broth instead. since it's not as strong as using chicken stock in a box

So simple and very tasty.  I used slightly less herbs de Provence - maybe a scant teaspoon - as it tends to be pretty strong.  I also used brown rice, and had to cook it about 10 minutes longer.  Nice side dish that I will add to the rotation!

Delicious concept - made it even easier by using instant white rice. Melted 2 tbsp of butter in the micro and mixed the butter with the herbes and salt, then poured it over the prepared rice and fluffed it all together. Do NOT substitute for the Herbes de Provence. The lavender in the Herbes is what gives this rice its distinct and aromatic flavor.

Really great simple dish that is almost scandalously too simple! I used veggie broth and it was just fine, although next time I might take another reviewer's advice and saute some onions and garlic to mix in as well to add some flavor dimension.

I loved that this was quick and easy to make but besides those wonderful factors I also liked  how great it smelled when cooking and the whole dish in itself.  I added 1 Tbs. of butter, used 1 chicken bouillon instead of the salt.    Those were the only changes I made.  It was gone so fast that next time I have to double the recipe!  Thank you Jennifer!

I made this last night and my boyfriend loved it.  I used Thai rice and usually 1 1/4 cups of water.  For this recipe, I used 1 1/2 cups of Knorr instant vegetable broth.  It was excellent, but I am going to use two cups as suggested next time.  I sauteed onions and frozen French green beans in olive oil and they tasted awesome mixed in with the rice.  Thanks for an easy and tasty rice recipe!

Inspired by LadyJayPee's beautiful photo, I decided to try this on my "plain buttered rice" hubby. I was nervous about the herbes de provence, so I only used 1/2 the amount in the recipe. I worried in vain--his first words after one bite: "this rice is great!" I love this kind of success with new recipes--thank you for sharing Jennifer!

Pretty good as a side dish for a sauced main dish. Did not overwhelm the sauce. I sprinkled with Molly McButter to add more flavor.

Excellent side dish!  Loved the flavor of the herbs (we used rosemary, basil, parsley, and thyme).  My husband reserved the stock with herbs, added mushrooms, and created a soup to accompany dinner.  Lovely!

This was a delicious recipe that we enjoyed.  I usually make mashed potatoes to serve with Chef John's Coq Au Vin recipe but wanted to change it up and this is definitely the way to go!!!

Made a couple of times & a good thing I did before deciding on keeping it or not. Making as directed there wasn't much flavor so hubby wanted to delete it. We tried again last night & now it is something we'll make again. We added more herbes de Provence by half.

I substituted 1/2 tsp each marjoram, thyme, rosemary & basil instead of the Herbes de Provence. It was very fragrant but a bit dry.

This rice side-dish sounds classy & delicious.  I plan to try it later this week with shrimp (I'll double both amounts) when my in-laws come over for a birthday dinner.   I would never have thought to use those herbs in rice, but it sounds amazing!  Thanks for this great new idea, .... since we like to have rice as a side-dish (perhaps once a week) so a new way to prepare it is always welcome.

Delicious! Trying to eat healthy by avoiding sauces and gravies, so a flavorful rice dish is a plus. I used whole grain instead of white rice and bumped up the Herbes de Provence to 2 tbsp. Sooo good!

I made this as is. It was delicious! I love things to be very flavorful and this was. My only warning would be to make sure this doesn't over power your main dish. I made this originally with a chicken dish with a light sauce and the only thing I would do differently is to cut back on the Herbes de Provence. Now tonight, I'm making this with a sausage dish - full force on the Herbes baby! :D

Wonderful recipe,  even easier and fool proof using the rice cooker...put it all in, shut the lid and in no time at all its moist, flavor is perfect and warm until ready to use.

First time: This was a great way to serve up rice, unfortunately my herbes de provence blend was a bit heavy on the lavender so it had too much of a soapy taste in a few bites, however that wasn't the fault of the recipe and my wife and I loved it!

Second time: learning from my previous mistake of not having all the herbs separate, I used 1/2 tsp of basil, marjoram, thyme, and rosemary. For authenticity sake, I added a dash of lavender. I used jasmine rice which called for a 1.25:1 ratio of water to rice, so I was worried it may have not absorbed all the water, but the rice came out absolutely perfect. While the portions of herbs I used ended up being a bit over 2 tsp, it still tasted great. I think next time I'll try doing a garni bouquet of the same 4 herbs + lavender and see how much better it gets. As it stands now, I'd easily build a meal around this if I had company I was trying to impress.

Um, yeah. This was alright. My oldest son loved it, but the three other people who ate this rice didn't care for it. It was edible, we just didn't care for the combination of spices. I most likely won't make this again.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I love Herbs de Provence and I loved how the kitchen smelled fragrant while cooking the rice.  I didnt have chicken broth so I used water and it still came out great.  I also used jasmine rice which added its own taste and fragrance.  This would be good with herbed chicken and asparagus with herbs de provence from this site.

I liked using the chicken broth instead of water.  My rice seemed too sticky, though.  It felt like it was missing something, but it still tasted good.

Hmmmmm...not sure what to say here. Not very tasty, bland, herbs were overpowering didnt compliment the rice at all. I used brown rice not sure if that made a difference. Sorry wasnt for us.

Excellent side dish with the Mediterranean Lemon Chicken I made. Nice fluffy texture and the herb mixture was very tasty. I found the broth and herbs clashed a tiny bit, so maybe I'll change up the mixture a bit next time and maybe add lavender to the herbs as well. This is so simple to make that you can play with it to make to personal taste.

Still easy to make and very good with any chicken dish.

This was a good recipe and about as simple as you can get.   Next time though  I may cut down on the herbs a tiny bit.  Thanks for a great way to spruce up boring rice!

I had bought some Herbes de Provence a few months back for a different recipe, so had to try this.  It's very tasty, subtle and light.  Who know that such a combination of spices could really bring plain old white rice out if it's shell!  A nice change of pace from creamy rice recipes.

Amazing! Seemed too simple to be so good, but I tried it because of all the great reviews. I'm glad I did! I did use a mixture of short grain brown rice and a wild blend of gourment brown rice. I also added a good 3 Tbsp. butter. It was wonderful with Pleasant pork chops, also found on this site. Thank you for the recipe.
