Honestly, the only chow mein noodle that I’m familiar with is the fried type that you buy in the can.  I hope you know what type noodles the recipe calls for because I couldn’t find them and ended up using Trader Joe’s Fresh Rice Noodles which turned to mush.  If I make this again, I’ll use my old stand-by for lo mein, “thick” Barilla spaghetti.  The sauce is good and with the exception of the noodles, we enjoyed this dish.  I did add some snow peas, sliced red bell pepper for color, and a garnish of some chopped peanuts.  In the future, I’ll most likely add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to suit our tastes.

The peanut sauce, the sesame oil and the cilantro are the keys. You can change the meat (pork might be nice), the vegetables (I added broccoli and carrots) or the noodles (I used whole wheat spaghetti) and anyhow you'll get a delicious plate.

Used spaghetti noodles added pepper flakes.  Red bell or shredded carrot would add some color.  Tasty dish.I would make again.

This recipe rocked!  My partner ate almost four servings before stopping.  We both really enjoyed it.  An added benefit  is how flexible it is to substitutions.

Notes to self:  white wine vinegar worked as a sub for RWV; crunchy PB worked, and the addition of chopped peanuts would work well; basic mushrooms worked; the cilantro is necessary. 

We added dried Chili pepper flakes on a whim and wouldn’t change it.  We also added thin carrot slices, which worked both visually and by taste.

We didn’t find the need for addl. sauce.  It was the perfect amount.

This was delicious.  The only change I made was in the different veggies I used because I had them on hand.  I used broccoli, carrots and sugar peas.  I did serve it with sriracha on the side and it's addition gave it some kick for the adults. Thanks for sharing!

Great sauce. Add more veggies. It was good with tofu instead of chicken.

I didn't have green onion and cilantro, but will make sure I have it the next time.  It tasted very good (the BF loved it!).  I also substituted tofu cubes for the chicken, as the BF is vegetarian.  The tofu cubes worked out fine, as it tends to take on the flavor of what it's cooked with.

This peanut sauce is delicious! I used more vegetables  (carrots, broccoli, snow peas, yellow onions, mushrooms, and bean sprouts ) and skipped the cilantro because I don't like it.  It was SO good, Mom had seconds and asked me to make it again soon!

If you use western style noodles and you don't mix the water with Baking Soda, you're doing it wrong.   2 Qts Water, 2 tbsps baking soda.  After 10-12 minutes rinse the noodles thoroughly.  Done, eastern style noodles.  :)

My daughter and I just loved this recipe. I added more veggies and used one large chicken breast. There was enough for our lunches the next day.

Pretty yummy! I did it without chicken and more veggies. The noodles were a little mushy so I'd cook them a little less next time, but otherwise good!

This is so good.  Used "Canton" noodles -- which are the yellow curly dried ones that come in the clear pack.  Even the kids love it!

This is definitely one of our favorites!! It will be on our meal rotation for sure! We added a tbsp of butter to the mix when we sauteed the mushrooms. Just felt like it needed a bit more liquid in the pan & butter ALWAYS goes well with mushrooms. We also tripled the amount of cilantro. We also played around with other additions - we found that sesame seeds and crushed red pepper flakes work very well!

My family and I loved this recipe. The peanut butter was a bit much for me, but i know next time I can adjust the amount. Other than that my children loved it. Even my picky eater! ??
