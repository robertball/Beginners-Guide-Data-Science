Had no peas, regular bread crumbs, Worcestershire, but had Asian fish sauce and panko bread crumbs. Had only a 10x14 glass dish. Added mushrooms and a diced celery rib to the saute. Used mix of Parmigiano Regiano and Pecorino Romano for crumb topping, and increased quantities by 50% for larger area pan. COVID-19, ya know. Delicious! Gave only 4 stars as I changed the recipe a bit.
As CJ says. "That's just you cooking."

As always, your recipes are the best! I made 2 small changes:  I substituted leftover roast chicken for the tuna & used penne pasta instead of egg noodles - absolutely delicious!  My new go-to casserole recipe. - FGB

Not Mrs. Kotter's tuna casserole! This was great. I had an open bottle of white wine, so I used the last of it (~2/3 cup) in place of some of the milk, and it added a really nice bit of acidity. I added the wine to the roux and let it cook for few seconds so it wouldn't curdle the milk, and then whisked in the milk. This makes a huge batch, which was fine because the leftovers are delicious, but I think next time I'll try a half recipe. I only had water-packed tuna and it was fine.

I added a bit of garlic to the onions and spread some green olives on top of the casserole before adding crumbled potato chips (because that’s the way I like it). I omitted the salt since I’d get plenty from the olives and chips. Thanks for another great recipe!

An easy and delicious recipe for an old-time favorite with a topping that's to die for!  As a hallmark with casseroles, it's even better as leftovers. To fully enjoy, call in the reserves for the serious clean-up (LOL).  Enjoy!

Real good recipe, have made it twice. First time, I followed the recipe, and used potato chip topping. Outstanding.  I used up all of my fridge and freezer leftovers for the second try. Added a dollop of sour cream, and a bit of cream cheese, a dollop of mayo, and a bit of creme  fraishe, which basically cleaned off my fridge door. 3 cans of really outdated tuna fish, and had enough frozen peas and carrots languishing in the freezer as well. On to the pantry, where I combined panko , regular, and Italian bread crumbs. Was a little short, so I crumbled up some ritz crackers to make the mark. Added 2 cloves garlic to the filling as well. Very delicious, richer than the published recipe, and the garlic I think this casserole needs. Everyone gobbled it up,, and the best part, I had a whole trashcan full of empty containers!  Nice!  I grew up poor as you can be, and I refuse to waste a scrap of food. Thanks Chef John!

It was terrific.  I used three cans of tuna and couldn't imagine using less.  I used a little extra cheddar cheese in the sauce. And crushed potatoe chips were the absolutely perfect topping for the dish.  My husband LOVED it!

Tuna noodle casserole is one of my absolute favorite meals. I had all the ingredients except one, which was the Parmigiano-Reggiano and I could not for the life of me find it at the store. So I used more bread crumbs in place of that.  I used whole milk and did not find any tuna in olive oil (only water and vegetable) so I used tuna in water. As far as how it turned out it is good but not quite great. I do like my tuna casserole pretty moist so next time I think I'll add more liquid to the ratio. Oh, I did add an extra 1/4 cup of peas because I love peas, doubly so in my tuna casserole. The consistency before baking was pretty on par with what Chef John shows in the video. I am a notoriously picky eater but I am enjoying the results of this recipe so I'll likely try it again with a few custom tweaks.

No tuna, but used shredded leftover chicken. Had only a bit of Gruyere and packaged Cheddar leftover.  Very good, but I beg to differ. Not the King of casseroles, but Chef John's Macaroni and Cheese IS the King. of casseroles. Next time, will grate cheese beforehand, hopefully, if it's available. Thanks, Chef John.

It was good but not what I expected from Chef John. Usually his dishes are above and beyond just with the ingredients he demonstrates. This one needs something. I'll have to surf the comments to see what people smarter than me added.

I made this exactly as recipe directed. It was tasteless. It is the first recipe of Chef's John that was not good. Not one person in my house liked it saying it had no flavor. It was also not creamy enough. If I made it again I would increase everything! More cheese, more salt and pepper, more sauce ect. I am not sure I will try again. Very tasteless.

Liked it.  Not as creamy as I expected though.  Maybe a few less noodles.  The only change I made was using albacore tuna in water. I have never bought tuna in oil, not sure if that makes a big difference or not.

I love Chef John so I thought I’d give this a try. I hate to say it but this is the blandest tuna casserole I’ve ever tasted, even after upping the seasonings. I took the suggestion of using crumbled potato chips in lieu of the bread crumbs, mixing them with shredded Parmesan and olive oil and the topping was quite delicious, but it still didn’t make up for the flavorlessness of the rest.

Sounds wonderful for tomorrow.  I will use potato chips to top it and I'm going to use a 9 x 9 dish because I like a taller slice, and noodles should be able to support it.  I'll let it cook an extra 10 minutes to account for that.

It was going to be really good until I put it in the oven for the suggested 30 minutes. But the oven dried out the sauce and sucked out all the flavor.

A tip for anyone working through their quarantine stockpile: this works GREAT with two cans of chicken in place of the tuna as well! Other than that, we didn't change a thing.

Turned out pretty good. I had to add extra seasonings and it was still pretty mellow, but tuna noodle casserole is supposed to be that way, just simple. The BF had never eaten it before, but he liked it nonetheless. Probably will make this again when I forget to thaw something out.

I agree with Mousielove, JohnL and Tashagang. This recipe works equally well with chicken. , but I would use frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas. That's the beauty of these recipes, you work with what you've got. Speaking of which, I almost always put chopped or finely sliced celery in my casseroles and try to have a jar or two of minced  pimientos around for taste and color. Lastly, I can't stand the Tuna in Water and, if you buy a good brand, packed in olive oil. you can drain it off and use it in the  topping.

I made this exactly as the recipe called except for one addition. I added fresh mushrooms into the butter instead of onions because my husband doesn't like onions. He can tolerate onion powder and pureed onion. I added a little extra cayenne, but everything else was as called for in the recipe.  I actually took it out of the oven at 25 minutes and let it rest for 10 minutes. There was enough sauce that some of it was trying to bubble out of the side, but it was very little. The casserole was delicious. My husband enjoyed it as well. I gave it four stars because I added to the original recipe with the mushrooms and it actually began to be a little bit dryer than we would have liked.  I will make this again, but will most likely either add more sauce or cook it for less time. 20 minutes might actually do it. It was definitely a golden brown, if not a little darker when I removed it. I'm attaching pictures.

Turned out very dry - I would double the sauce.    I also added onions and mushrooms to up the flavor.   I love Chef John's recipes, but this one kind of missed the mark in terms of the sauce.
