I did not grill these--I did roast the asparagus in the oven only because the weather hasn't been great and I could not wait to try these. I did not use light butter, just regular salted butter. I also used reduced fat sour cream because that was what I had on hand. I thought this was fantastic. The drizzle over the top really made the roasted asparagus even better. This has got to be one of the best asparagus recipes I've ever had.

Best asparagus ever! I skipped the boiling part and just through the asparagus on the grill. Worked great. This sauce is seriously amazing, I was dipping my pork in it too. I added a bit of lemon zest to it too for a more intense lemon flavor. Thanks for the recipe, it'll be used often:)

This is much bigger than the fact this is an asparagus side dish recipe.  It really is the sauce that is the versatile star of the show! While this was delicious on the asparagus, I can imagine it would be just as good on any number of things - vegetables, potatoes, or any savory dish you'd use sour cream. Fresh, light and creamy with just the right amount of cilantro herbiness.  And even with that, I would imagine this would also be very good with the herb(s) of your choice.  This unique recipe has many interesting possibilities and variations. (Note: Steaming the asparagus on the grill wrapped in foil is sufficient.  The initial step of cooking the asparagus in boiling water isn't necessary)

At first I thought the sauce would be tart, not so.  It was very mild, a bit reminiscient of a ranch dressing but a pop of zestiness from the cilantro.  The sauce MAKES the asparagus!

This cilantro lemon butter is a star that went right into my recipe box!  Perfect on the asparagus AND our grilled Yukon gold potato side too!

Cilantro added a nice taste, but found the lemon too strong.  Sauce also cooled off asparagus so it didn't remain hot for too long.

This was a really nice side! I do not have a barbeque, so I roasted it in the oven at  400 F for the recommended time instead.  Put the sauce in a bowl so that the asparagus doesn't get cold. The sauce was very nice and light! Very lemony, went well with the cilantro. I will absolutely do this again!

I made some changes, based only on what I had on hand. I used regular, salted butter, regular sour cream, and bottled lemon juice. I thought it made a great sauce and will certainly make it again. As I'm getting ready to get back on a diet, I will use the healthier ingredients next time.

I will say that I baked in the oven instead of using the grill, and it worked out well.  They weren't that thick so it only took about 15mins at 400. The sauce was nice but I'm not a lemon lover so that's why it's a 4 but my daughter loved it and she's a fan of lemon.  So if you're a fan then keep the same if you're like me, maybe add half the amount.  I also think I'll chop up more cilantro next time.

I loved this recipe, probably because I love sour cream and lemon so much.  Would have given it 5 stars for myself, but hubby and kids didn't love it as much as I did (they did like it and eat it) so that is why I gave it 4.

I loved it, wished I had made more asparagus so I could've eaten more. My husband didn't even try the sauce simply after seeing what the ingredients are; still working on breaking him of that. But overall, it's an amazing recipe :)
