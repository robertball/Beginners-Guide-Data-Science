This is DELICIOUS! Restaurant-quality.  I was afraid of the ketchup, but the red wine adds so much body to the flavor that it just works.  My family devoured it, and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this yesterday. 
I used squash because that is what I had. 
I also used the sweet Italian sausage from Kroger. 
I also used half spicy ketchup and half regular because I needed to use up the spicy. 
I threw in about 2 cups of spinach.
The only thing I would do differently is rinse the sausage after I drain it. 
All in all, this soup was fantastic and I will keep it in my rotation. Great way to use up veggies and eat off of it for several meals. It makes a huge pot!

Wow! This was delicious!  We made it without the sausage. It is so flavorful. Kids loved it too!

Excellent! This is fabulous soup!  Added a little extra garlic (2 extra cloves) and 2 TBS of sugar to compensate for the ketchup (just to be safe) :) also some pepper & everyone loved this soup - served it last night with fresh made dinner rolls.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Added extra broth and crushed tomatoes as the tortellini absorbs so much liquid.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers, and used less ketchup.  Also on someone's advice, I added chopped spinach at the last minute.  We did like it a lot.

People, when you use tomato paste, make sure you use a little sugar, it balances out the flavors.

This was so good! My husband said it was one of the best soups I've made. I followed the recipe but added two handfuls of spinach and did 1 cup of wine and 2/3 of ketchup instead of the recommended amounts of each. Loved the zucchini in it!!

This is a really great "base" recipe!  I've made this several times.  I agree with a previous reviewer that using tomato paste instead of ketchup cuts the sweetness a bit.  My Family tends to load up on the tortellini, and since this recipe doesn't specify a type; cheese, spinach, or sausage, I've found that any pasta tossed in and cook with any remaining broth also makes for great "left overs."  This a good go to for a pasta soup!

This soup is pretty great and easy to make. I added some Italian spices, salt and pepper for some extra flavor. Don't put in too muh tortellini like I did or it will turn into a stew. A really yummy stew. :)
