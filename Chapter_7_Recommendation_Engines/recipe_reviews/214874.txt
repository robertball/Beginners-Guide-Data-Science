This is really close to what my family has always used we just didn't use any sugar and added a dash of Tabasco sauce. It really refrigerates great and can be stored there for up to a year! We use it on EVERYTHING we grill! We just heat it up after coming out of the refrigerator!

To mustardy to vinegary. Not for us. Halved the recipe and used on grilled chicken legs. My husband (who likes hot and spicy) said "don't make this one again".
