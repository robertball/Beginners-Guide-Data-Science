This was pretty good! The stuffing mixture got pretty mushy for me, while the pork was a little tough. Any ideas on how to make sure the meat stays more moist?

My husband liked these, but we had mixed reviews with everyone else...  I followed the recipe except that I used apricot preserves in place of the marmalade... I used boxed couscous with pinenuts and added some dried cranberries.  I thought it was pretty good.  I didn't add more couscous on top because I think it looks nicer with just the preserves.  If I make again, I'll smooth out the preserves with a little OJ.  Another thing I better mention is that the recipe suggests to use a small dish, but when I did that, about halfway through the cooking time, they were swimming in pork fat (yuck)... I had to transfer them out so the couscous wouldn't soak it up!

I made a couple of small changes. Used Pine nut flavored couscous in place of pine nuts & regular couscous, water in place of chicken broth, & dried cranberries in place of currents. It was delicious!

This is fantastix! I didn't have currants or craisins, so i chopped up homemade cinnamon pears and some sesame seeds (no pine nuts, either). Everybody loved this, definitely a keeper!

This was an easy recipe to follow and gave the right suggestions.  I did change up the recipe by using dried apricots (no currants) and roasted slivered almonds (no pine nuts).  Very yummy!!  The couscous was great the next day as a side item for lunch.

This first time I made this recipe, I had to make one change. I substituted dried cranberries (craisins) for the currants (I don't use them.) It was GREAT! The second time I made it (for my Dad's birthday), I doubled the couscous stuffing. I ended up with enough to almost cover the chops. It worked just fine. The chops were moist and we had plenty of the stuffing to have as a side. This recipe is definately a keeper!

I served it to relatives in town, and it was the first time I made it.  It was very tasty and a great alternative to chops that are always full of stuffing.

My family loved it.  I didn't add the currants and pine nuts since I knew that my teen boys wouldn't like the texture.  I used apricot preserves in place of marmalade.  We will make this again!

I searched for a couscous stuffing recipe and this is wonderful!  Thank you!

I changed the recipe and diced local (not processed) sun dried tomatos instead of currants.  And I soaked dried lily flowers and chopped them when dried.  I cheated and added a molecule of fresh ginger once the couscous was ready as a stufffing.

Flavor was fantastic but the meat was a bit dry. I will try it again.

Used dried cranberries instead of currants and didn't have marmalade so used an apple cinnamon jelly instead. Do you think you could stuff them in the morning and refrigerate them until dinner time?

We enjoyed  this very much.  Will definitely make again, I will pound the pork chops a little to make them even more tender.  Craisins were a perfect touch.
