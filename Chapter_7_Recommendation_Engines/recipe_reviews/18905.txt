I think I used too much butter or maybe my bacon wasn't lean enough because I found them a little greasy BUT they tasted great. I'll definately make these again. If your anything like me and have trouble making all the items ready at the same time you can turn the oven up to 500F and let them bake without the foil for about another 15 minutes.

Way too much grease. To really save, cook the potatoes in the oven with just a little sprinkle of olive oil, cook the bacon separately, then dice it and put on the potatoes after they are done. No added butter is necessary.

Absolutely delicious.  Definitely not for those watching their fat or cholesterol.  I added extra bacon and used red onion, and the house smelled wonderful for hours.

Good recipe.  I tweaked it a little bit, adding more bacon and a handful of shredded cheese at the end.  Defintely not for the calorie or cholesterol counters out there.  I agree with the note to not skimp on the butter.  Yum!

5++ stars. When my husband tells me to keep a recipe, that's serious business, lol! I only had 4 russets so that's what I used. I used 3 T of butter and a bit less bacon (only because bacon is like gold in this house). I also added a small bell pepper from the garden and next time I'll add a jalapeno. I had to cook mine longer and I added sharp cheese at the end. They were glorious and reminded my husband of Irish Potatoes that we used to get when we were in college from a local pub type restaurant.

I made these last night and enjoyed-though had to make some adjustments. I had adjusted the servings from 6, down to 2, so I had to adjust the baking time somewhat. Besides having less potatoes in the dish, baking time is also somewhat dependent on how they are cut. The recipe says to "thinly slice" the potatoes, but neither photo showed thinly sliced potatoes. I cut mine into Â½ in. cubes. Rather than the 45 minutes, I checked them after 30 minutes and the potatoes were well cooked, but because they had been sealed under the foil, they were simmering in liquid that had cooked out. I uncovered them, turned the oven to "Lo-broil" and placed the rack one notch lower than the top, and it took them another 20-25 minutes (stirring every 3 or 4 minutes) to dry up the liquid and crisp up. After cubing them, I put them in a bowl and tossed with garlic salt, then spread in the pan, put the onions and (pre-cooked and cut up) bacon over as instructed, but I melted the butter in a little dish and drizzled over rather than trying to "dot" the butter. Some mentioned them being too greasy. Mine were not in the least bit greasy. Of course I did use precooked bacon which has less fat. I also used Smart Balance margarine, but they were very tasty. I'll definitely make these again.

Great, delicious meal. I was skeptical of the raw bacon like others mentioned but it was so good. The only tweak I made was I omitted a few pieces of the bacon. Mine did not come out greasy at all (let them set up a little bit after pulling them out before we ate them.) Will cook again, definitely!

I used precooked bacon and it worked perfectly. No grease! Just enough flavor. I only used one tablespoon of butter. I baked it at 375 degrees because I was cooking italian sausage in the same oven. After 45 minutes everything was cooked but I did put the potato dish under the broiler for a few minutes. Not really necessary with the precooked bacon though.

Taters are easy.......heat the oven to 450 F..........watch the amount of butter or any other oils. Do the bacon separately.  Season to taste...........cube potatoes instead of slicing.

Don't care for potatoes or grease very much so based on personal preference I'd have to give this recipe 3 stars. I probably won't do it again for tat reason, but if I did, I would definitely cut back to 1/4 cup of butter and 3-4 slices of bacon. Overall, recipe is decent, just not my favorite food.
