Holy Poke, this is a GREAT recipe!  I followed Chef John's instructions and made no changes.   There are few ingredients, and each are important.  I think that it would be a big mistake to deviate from this recipe or make substitutions.     I think that a common mistake may be to purchase an inexpensive cut of tuna.    If you cannot find or cannot afford high quality tuna, make another dish.    Look for a tuna loin that is a rich and luminescent, deep, dark red.   It is critical that the flesh be clear and free of white striations.  This is soft sinew, safe to eat but with a a really unpleasant stringy texture.    This sort of tuna will probably be difficult to find in large chain grocers.    I get mine from Whole Foods or a local fishmonger, but not every community has those options...      I always use high quality frozen tuna if it is superior to the fresh tuna.

This is so good!  Don't forget to add a squirt of lime juice at the end.  That was a huge improvement to an already great dish.  I served this on a bed of sushi rice surrounded by fresh produce - avocado, cucumber, asparagus, and red pepper.

I place some of the tuna on a cookie sheet then placed the tuna in the oven at 400 degrees for 4 minutes as half of my family cannot get past the raw fish.  It was just enough to allow my entire family to enjoy.  

I will definitely make this again, but true sushi style for me and the other raw fish eaters in my family.

Recipes was great - reminded me of the Poke I had in Hawaii last year in Maui.  Next time I will add Cucumbers and Avocado just like other Poke recipes suggest, but wanted to make as is - always a little annoyed when someone reviews a recipe (but changes it so the original recipe is not really what they are rating).  Good Job Chef John - as usual.

We have a local place here that is called Poke Bowl.  They have so many things you can put in your basic poke. I appreciate the basic Poke. This is basic and very good! I did not use the mac nuts as when we are in Hawaii every year I do not taste or feel that texture. Pic shows edamame, I made the pods boiled with salt water to serve on the side. And served the Poke on extra cold, shredded cabbage and romaine lettuce mixture. It was awesome!

This was great. I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used a tiny bit of ground. I also added an avocado and served with tortilla chips. I also used House of Tsang brand hot sesame oil. It adds a little more heat. I've made a similar recipe before but didn't allow for the 2 hour marinade. This was way better.

should’ve added to add lemon juice at the end in the first step. didn’t think it would cause an issue since i sliced a lemon already, but was going to eat my poke next day. ended up making my costco ahi tuna look like cat food and taste awful. made an account just for this. DO NOT ADD LEMON UNTIL THE END!!!. now im out ahi tuna, a lemon and tomorrow’s lunch.

Really tasty!   I found a Hula Market Poke Seasoning Mix on Amazon that has Kukui nut in it, which is authentic and what we always used in Hawaii.  The same brand (Hula Market) also has dried ogo (unless you're lucky enough to get fresh), which I couldn't find locally. 
Leave out the macnuts if you use the poke seasoning mix.

I loved it but I think I over salted according to my food critics (family).  I will give it another try.

I used low sodium soy,  and skipped adding  additional salt.  Added an extra teaspoon of fresh grated ginger.  Came out great!  Added avocado just prior to serving.  Suggest giving a stir half way through planned marination time.  May try  substituting sriracha for heat next time.  Had some mac nuts and while not traditional, it did add some nice crunch.

Good base recipe. This needs some sweet additions to counter the saltiness. I served with rice, edamame, corn, cilantro, finely chopped pineapple, cucumber, shaved carrot, toasted sesame seeds, avocado, sriracha mayo on top. Next time I will add another sauce to sweeten it up even more.

So delicious! I put it with jasmine rice, crushed pineapple, tomatoes and avocado. I drizzled a bit of rice vinegar too. Ate it twice in 1 day.

This is pretty close to the poke we had often in Kaui. The key is to let this sit in the fridge for a few hours.

I really wanted to love this, it looks so good. But all I could taste was soy sauce. I'll go back to one of the other poke recipes on this site, instead.

I couldn't believe how easy it was to make! Since I'm trying to cut down on sodium, I'd use the low sodium soy sauce next time. Will definitely make this again and maybe mix in some avocado and cucumber just before serving.
