Great recipe and a great way to liven up popcorn.  I love the parmesan cheese coupled with the cayenne pepper.

Really, really good. I used my air popper and just a touch of real butter instead of butter flavored spray. I also used nutritional yeast instead of parmesan cheese. It came out perfect.

I made this popcorn as a fun snack for my husband tonight, and since I don't do spicy- this is his review. ;)   He thinks it can use a little more salt (we didn't really measure our salt, so will try that next time) and it turned out kinda dry and unevenly distributed....  Not sure how we can fix that but overall he liked it!  We will have to do some experimenting! Thanks!

OOOOhhhhh Wow!! This is great!! I just used a bag of  butter flavored microwave popcorn and halved the recipe (no spray,though). Put the "spices" in a big bowl poured the popcorn on top and stirred it all up. Took 2 1/2 min!Made it for my 14 yr old and I can't keep my hand out of it :)

I've made something similar to this before, so I just eyeballed the seasonings according to my taste. I love popcorn, and this is one of my favorite ways to eat it.

We are trying several recipes out for flavored popcorn to sell at a fundraiser bake sale. This was OK. I thought the addition of parmesan was weird, but it definitely needs it. The pizza popcorn from a different website was far better. This recipe didn't make the cut.

I was in the mood for something other than butter. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I did differently was mix the ingredients together in a bowl then sprinkled it in to my bowl of popcorn.  That way it had just enough seasoning for my taste. I used no butter spay since my microwave popcorn came buttered.

Very Very good could even hit it with some cayanne pepper for a even spicier treat
