Excellent recipe for a Cuban sandwich.  I subbed my own homemade cuban rolls for the ciabatta and grilled/pressed the sandwiches, which is traditional, rather than baking.

Tried this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday. He loves spicy food more than me (because I don't like it) but this recipe was painfully spicy. I halved it and followed the directions exactly with all of the right ingredients except I lacked on the sliced pork loin because my local deli stopped selling it. I think next time I will increase the amount of mayo and decrease the ground chipotle peppers and cumin in the chipotle mayo sauce. Other than that the sandwich was delicious and the chipotle mayonnaise was very creative and different which can be good sometimes! :)

Not a traditional Cubano but a good sandwich none-the-less. Only changes were that I used Cuban bread rather than ciabatta rolls and I pressed sandwiches rather than baking them.

These were delish!! I added chipolte peppers in adobo sauce. It gave the sauce a nice spin. I wasn't sure whether the completed mayo sauce was to go over the mustard, or if the mustard was to be alone. I mixed them, but I think the mustard should have been on the bottom slice, and the sauce on the top to separate the flavors. That's why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.

Love, love, love!  The only problems we had were that it was too big of a sandwich for one person to eat and the spread was good enough.  The additional hot mustard was so not needed.  In fact, I think the mustard worked against the spread and we love the heat so it was not a heat issue.

Fantastic sandwich. The only changes I made was to the chipotle mayo - instead of the basil/garlic spread I added 1/2 teaspoon each  of dried basil and garlic. It turned out fantastic. We'll definitely make this again whenever we have left over pork loin.

Really simple and really tasty. Made it for the kids on movie night and they enjoyed the meal without making a mess - great alternative to pizza.
