used canned green beans instead of fresh, used Northern beans instead of chick peas, could easily see how you could add other things, had no trouble with the tin foil sticking

I doubled this and cooked the spuds in their own pan. The potatoes stuck to the foil so I won’t use foil to roast them again. I also used frozen French cut green beans and just defrosted them halfway in the microwave before adding to the bowl. Otherwise, I followed the directions as written. This got an A+ from both me and my 14yo son and I’ll definitely make it again!

It was very tasty with the olive oil and basil I did not have green beans, but used broccoli instead and it was delicious!

Used less olive oil and doubled the basil.  It was much better than it looked.

Used chopped tomatoes from my garden, Italian beans, and kidney beans. About 15 minutes into cooking the bean tomato mixture mixed in kidney beans and about 1/2 cup of cooked left over ham pieces. Stirred all into potatoes. Mingled flavors well. Was a hit and a keeper.

very tasty.  I replaced the green beans with asparagus and added fresh corn, cut right off the cob and baby heirloom tomatoes ( in place of the cherry tomatoes) for a truly seasonal dish.  Next time I'll add Marcona almonds to the last 5 minutes of the roast for different texture.

This is really good. I added some vegan sausage to mine. The flavor was outstanding, especially the cherry tomatoes. Thank you.

It was delicious. I omitted the oil, lime and cilantro. Instead used Ken's balsamic vinaigrette dressing generously and added turkey mild Italian sausage, thinly sliced, and layered on top.  The next day, had leftovers which were even more delicious. Probably because it marinated over night. Next time, I'll make it ahead of time and let it marinate. Will, definitely, make again......yum.   Added parmigiana cheese when served.

Made as is,  expect getting the natural flavor essence of the veggies, because all that olive oil isn't going to excite taste buds--unless those taste buds are pure vegan.  So you might want to dash on flavorful Italian or Balsamic vinaigrette  salad dressings--along with generous sprinkles of dry flavor seasonings; that should help with the flavor issue.
