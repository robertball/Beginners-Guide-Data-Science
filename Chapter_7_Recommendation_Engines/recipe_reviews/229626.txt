I made this for a family dinner (eight people) and received rave reviews with nothing left over. It was many peoples first time trying eggplant, or the first time after a bad experience with it years ago. I'm happy to report that I turned everyone into eggplant fans! I made the following alterations because of the increased number of guests and what I had readily availible: I used 3 good sized eggplants, about 3 cups of chopped mushrooms, about a half of a really huge onion, and found that a little over a 1/4 cup of butter sufficed. I also didn't have breadcrumbs so used about a cup and a half of Panko (which was delicious and crunchy and made up for some of the left-out buttery flavor). I also didn't have 'Italian Seasoning' so I eyeballed a mixture of basil, oregano, thyme, dried parsley and sage. I was a bit short on Swiss so i diluted it with a bit of shredded cheddar, and it was wonderful. I made one shell without cheese for a specific guest and they loved it, so if you dont have swiss of much cheese on hand I wouldn't worry about if affecting the outcome too much, maybe just top off with a bit of parsley. LOVED IT and might make it as a new side this christmas! I would highly recommend using this recipe to convert any eggplant skeptic!

I love eggplant and wanted to find a dish that would inspire my family to love it, too. This is it! My changes: olive oil instead of butter, a quarter cup of marinara sauce added after cooking the mushrooms and whole grain bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese instead of Swiss. Easy and delicious!

Less salt goes a long way, and I used allspice instead of Italian seasoning. Very good.

It was good.  It would make a good side dish.  I think I'd prefer it with mozzarella cheese or parmesan.

Only problem is WAY too much salt. I agree that 1 tsp would suffice. Next time I'll cut the butter down and add more mushrooms and less onion and bread crumbs. Nice side dish though.

Really enjoyed it.  Usually don't like to change recipe and then review based on my changes but because we tried to eat mainly paleo, I removed the breadcrumbs, added some canned tomatoes that I had in the fridge - I would say about 1/3 - 1/2 cup, mixed in parmesan cheese to the mix and covered in Monetary  Jack cheese.  Hubby loved it so either my changes made it better or this is a very versatile recipe (and I think it is the later)

Since we had lots of tomatoes ripe in the garden along with the eggplant, I added 1 cup chopped tomatoes to the skillet with the pulp as well as 2 Tblsp fresh basil leaves torn..  Also 4 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 pound of browned ground beef to make it a complete meal.  I used Mozzarella cheese.

It tasted like something that should be eaten as a side dish...like stuffing. After a few bites, it felt pretty heavy. It might just be that we are not fans of eggplant.

I have made this dish several times. I've tried it vegan, and it delicious that way too!  Just take out the cheese and use olive oil instead of butter. I just love the cheese on top! 

I don't care for the eggplant boats, so I just put it in a casserole dish.

I'm always on the look out for a good eggplant recipe and this one has certainly made the cut. I've made this multiple times now and it has been a hit every time. This recipe makes for a good side dish or as a meal all by itself, as it is very filling. Also it's a good recipe for those who are looking to expand their cooking abilities.
