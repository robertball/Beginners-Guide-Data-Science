Very very good and incredibly easy. It's true okra sliced this way is not gooey. I decreased the amount made and the onions and garlic were near carmelized but it only added to the delicious taste of the dish. I did add more garlic than called for but that was really the only change I made. I will definitely make again!

Great tasting!  I did not have that okra mucous nearly as bad by slicing lengthwise as I do when slicing in coin shapes!  I did not use the oil, instead, I just sprayed the pan.  I loved the taste of the lime in this!  I will be making this again!

I was looking for a way to use up some frozen okra, and this recipe was just right.  I did not slice it, though.  I cooked the frozen okra in the microwave per the package directions, drained,  and allowed it to cool.  I then proceeded with the recipe, but used the okra whole.   I think a little less oil would be better next time, plus I forgot the lime, so I'll be making this recipe again.

Yes! Even the teens in the house LOVED this. Doubled the garlic and added popped mustard seed, fresh ground coriander seeds, aesifodite and fresh tomato. Served with a pork roast and garlic mashed potato.

I like this fresh take on okra. It was good as a side dish and not slimy at all.

Simple and delish. Instead of black pepper I added red crushed pepper and gave it a little heat.

I personally do not eat okra.  I made this for my bf and he LOVED IT.  This was the first time I've ever prepared okra and it received raved reviews.  Thank you for the great recipe

I agree - very easy recipe. I found that the garlic was,beyond caramelized to the point of tasting burnt. The 5 minutes for the onion was to long as,well as they continued to cook with the okra. I will.try this again but tweak the cooking time
