I made this last night, unfortunatley we didn't eat dinner last night - so I put it in the fridge for tonight.  This was spectacular!!!!  5 STARS!!!  I made it with sauteed chicken breasts and linguine.  Absolutely wonderful, this will go into my Favorite Sauces catagory!  I doubled the recipe so I had enough to coat the 3 chicken breasts and the pasta and it was wonderful!!  Great recipe, this should not be labeled as just a seafood sauce, because it was excellent on chicken and pasta!!  THANK YOU!!!

Used this on yellow fin tuna steaks.  I was out of tarragon and used thyme.  The family asked to have this sauce everytime we have fish.  Thanks

The flavors in this sauce were wonderful, very savory and tangy.  We loved it over chicken tenderloins and wild rice.  I did add some flour and heavy cream to it, but it really wasn't necessary. Would be just as delicious without the extra calories.

We really enjoyed this sauce.  I made it exactly as to the specifications with the exception of using only a scant teaspoon of the tarragon.  After I finished it and tasted it, I decided to add one tablespoon of heavy cream to cut down the acidity for my husband.  He loved every bite he took.  I used chicken tenders cooked in olive oil with a touch of butter for this meal, and we have enough left over for a sandwich today.  I'll take part of the sauce and mix it with the mayo for the sandwich.  We can hardly wait!  I can see why this would be perfect for a porous white fish because the flavors would seep into it so perfectly.  Next time!  I'm glad I pulled this recipe from my oldest entry page of my recipe box (a challenge from mis7up, a Recipe Buzzer).  UPDATE:  We did have a delicious sandwich using the leftovers today.  This fits our definition of delicious.  I understand that others may not like the taste of tarragon, but YUM!

This sauce was ok, it tasted good and was quick to put together, but I was looking for a creamier sauce ... I prefer when it sticks a little better to the fish instead of just pooling around it.

This was very good.  I didn't have shallots, so used onion, and didn't have fresh parsley, so used dried.  The kids complained that it needed more flavor, but I think it was because of my substitutions.  I do think that I might go a little heavier on the garlic and tarragon next time.  When I added the parsley, I also added raw, peeled and deveined shrimp and stirred to coat.  When the shrimp was cooked, I poured everything over a bowl of thin spaghetti, tossed and served.  Even though the kids made that initial comment, I did notice that there were no leftovers, and that is my gauge of a good recipe!

This is a really great sauce. I used it over fresh pan seared tilapia fillets and I was very pleased. The ingredients in the sauce really enhance to flavor of the fish. It was also very easy to make. Definitely a keeper for me. Thanks for sharing.

The Tarragon overpowered the whole sauce. I will try it again maybe with dill.

Great basic recipe for chicken, fish or pasta.  This is a staple for me.  You can add other herbs and spices to suite whatever you are using this recipe for.

My hubby doesn't like a lot of sauce and I like a lot of sauce. This recipe was a good compromise.  I served it over frozen asparagus/cheese ravioli from Costco and steamed brocollini. I gave it 5 stars because it added a zing to a basic meal with minimal effort. I had to substitute fresh ingredients with dried (parsley, onions) and it still came out pretty well. I also let it simmer a little longer to thicken up the sauce. I imagine it can only get better with the right ingredients so look forward to the next attempt.

The sauce was ok but strongly disliked by one of my roommates and the other said it was good...so mixed reviews in my house. I will give it another try considering this was my first run at the recipe.

I completely agree with Natalie E -the tarragon in this sauce totally overpowered and ruined it.  None of the three people in my house that ate it liked it. (In fact, everyone disliked it a lot) I even went back to make sure I prepared it properly and didn't leave out any ingredients I was so disappointed in the way it came out and I had not made any mistakes.  I served this over a white fish as suggested.  I will definitely not use this recipe again and do not recommend it.  Perhaps if someone really loves tarragon and just wants a sauce that taste like that, they would like it?

Made this as written, but quadrupled the recipe because we like extra sauce. I didn't like this.  Maybe it was the tarragon, but it was totally overpowering and the lemon was too strong as well. It was very...acerbic.  It also didn't look a thing like this photo - it turned out very liquid-y and wouldn't reduce any further. I'm not sure how this sauce is supposed to be creamy, as in the photo - there's nothing creamy in it -  melted butter and wine and lemon juice are all pretty clear and liquid.  Perhaps I simmered it too long  trying to get it to reduce.

This sauce was amazing. I tasted it when it was done as is (minus lemon and tarragon because I didn't have any on hand) and although delicious, I was craving some cheese in my sauce... So I added some garlic and herb white cheddar and that made it phenomenal. 

We had it over shrimp, chicken and rice (it was delicious mixed in with plain white rice). Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making it again soon.

This was excellent! I simmered it longer than the instructions said, and also added baby shrimp to this.  Poured it over asparagus, and would be great with pasta and some sliced black olives! Olive Garden has a dish very similar called shrimp scampi.

Very simple to make, wonderful taste. Everyone loved it. I think I could easily vary this recipe by adjusting the proportions of the ingredients  or by making substitutions (like dill, basil or cilantro instead of tarragon). I made this for flounder but I think it would be great on other types of fish as well as on chicken breast.

I made it over tilapia and used all the seasons that were in the sauce except for the salt and white pepper,Instead, I put salt-free seasonings and instead of fresh Parsley  I used cilantro. and I put lemon zest over the fish after pouring this sauce over it then it tasted even better with the sweet frozen corn I had as a side veggie.

Easy to make and perfect with a simple baked snapper.  Next time I’ll use less parsley and add other fresh herbs. Definitely a very good basic to experiment with.

This was an excellent recipe for a base white seafood sauce. The family and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I made it a couple a times. Second time I added 1/4 cup of organic whip cream and 2 tablespoons of  sour cream with 1 table spoon of capers.  it was also excellent and nice way to jazz up a basic sauce..

I used green onion instead of shallots, because that's what I had on hand, I will try the shallots next time.  The lemon I used was big and juicy so the sauce was a bit tart but I swirled 2 tbsp of butter in at the end and it was perfect. I served this with the blackened salmon fillets recipe I found on this site and sauteed brocollini.

This was very good. I did not have any shallots which would have been great so I used only 1 T. of regular yellow onion. I also wanted to thicken it just a touch so I added a slurry of a little cornstarch and water at the end. Served it over the Chesapeake Bay Stuffed Rockfish from this site. I will definitely use it again and again on other dishes.

I found it too tart with the lemon juice.  I will try it without lemon juice next time.

I had 2 crab cakes from several meals before and wanted to drizzle them with something that would keep them moist while reheating.  This recipe came to the rescue and saved the day.  I had expected the sauce to be a bit thicker than it was (4 stars).

I've just made this and I did not care for it.  It starts with a massive kick of lemon and leaves you with a greasy mouth.  I'm so glad I tasted it before using on my fish.

Great, quick flavourful recipe. I am not fussy on tarragon, as I found out after the first making of this, so I  made it again and substituted with Basil and Rosemary. Much more to my liking but maybe not to others. Regardless, the recipe as written is very good.

This was a good base.  I tweeked it to be a more 5 star version by reducing the amount of lemon juice, opting for fresh thyme instead of tarragon, adding a small amount of heavy cream and adding some grated Parmesan cheese.  It was wonderful after my adjustments.

Great sauce base.  We used it on Alaskan Cod and it went really well with a few adjustments: No tarragon or lemon as I didn't have any. Forgot the salt but added a bit of agave to thicken and sweeten the sauce.  Also, taking a cue from a pan-fried steak and red wine reduction combo, I kept the 'bits' left on the pan after cooking the fish and threw in the butter, shallots, and garlic for more complex flavor.

I used RealLemon instead of a juiced lemon, and it was a little overwhelming. I blame this on the conversion listed on that bottle though. I was able to fix this by adding flour and heavy cream
