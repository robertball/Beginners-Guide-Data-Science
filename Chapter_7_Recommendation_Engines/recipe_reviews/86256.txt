I loved this!  Taking others' advice, I doubled the amounts of vegetables, but not the sauce--I didn't quite use all of the sauce I made.  It was excellent and will be something I make again!  I used the quick and easy pizza crust recipe, doubled.

This is a 5 star served as an appetizer, a little too rich to be served as the main dish.

What a great recipe! Very tasty - my whole family loved it, especially my 6 year old vegetarian who asks to make it again and again. This is a keeper for us!

Interesting idea for pizza but unfortunately too bland tasting.

We liked this.  The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle some shredded mozzarella on top.  It was very tasty and something different.

I used a 10x15 baking sheet, and I felt there was way too much sauce and not enough toppings. This recipe is a good starting point, but I would nearly half the cream cheese, sour cream and onion, and add more mushrooms, red pepper, and spinach. I will also add broccoli next time.

i only rate this a three b/c i had all the ingredients on hand. 
i agree with another reviewer about the sauce being too much.  after eating halfway through my third piece, i could only pick off the toppings & nibble.  also, the flavor of the dill was overpowering to the flavor of the veggies.  i will be searching for an alternate white sauce for my future pizzas.

I used a gluten-free pizza crust whole-grain mix and used the 16 inch quantity â€“ doubling the ingredients and I only had a little too much of the cream cheese/ sour cream & topping  vegetable mixture  leftover .(I'll use that in another way.) After it came out of the oven I topped it with some Romano Pecorino cheese. ( I was afraid it would burn if I left it in the whole time. )  I can't eat tomatoes anymore and I absolutely love this. My son said he could have one piece only, but said he'll have another piece tomorrow
