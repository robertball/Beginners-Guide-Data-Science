I made this for Thanksgiving last year. I followed the recipe but this was awful. Tasted like crackers boiled in sugar water. I was going to serve it to my guests, but let's just say it never made it to the table. On the plus side, it was a beautiful pie to look at out of the oven. So pretty I took a few pics of it. I'll have to post one once I find them.

Soooo easy to make! I Have made several of these "mock apple pies" for the last 3 Holiday get togethers- have yet to hear a complaint except who got the last piece.

Many (!) years ago I found a recipe very similar to this on the Ritz Cracker Box - Mock Apple Pie. Made it quite often so I'll give this recipe a try.
