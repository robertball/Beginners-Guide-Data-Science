This soup was delish! I had a group over and there was not a drop left! I did change it up a bit: I one large fresh green pepper and instead of chili powder i used cumin, which gave it a great smell! I will be making this again!

This was very simple and easy to do. I very much like it. I didn't have frozen bell peppers, so I measured out 10 ounces of fresh and that equaled 2 large bells, seeded and cut into strips.  The flavor of the salsa really inhanced the stock and I didn't add anyother seasonings besides the chili powder and pepper. We thoroughly enjoyed this very much. I didn't really see that after adding the rice, that it was neccessary. But you could as easily added barley, brown rice, or oatmeal. But I'll leave the rice out next time. TY was delish.

Very good healthy recipe. Made it as written except I omitted the corn and the black eyed peas...just used black beans and a little extra rice.  Also added some fresh cilantro and used a box of chicken stock and skipped the boulion and the water.  Will definitely make this again.

This is the third New Years Day that I’ve made this soup and it’s become a tradition in our house.  My family really loves this soup, it’s hearty and very tasty.  We like to think of it as a type of vegetarian chili.  The only thing I change is to put extra garlic in it for an extra immune booster for the new year.  The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is that the frozen peppers sometimes are mushy and unappealing in the soup.

Instead of frozen bell peppers, I used a jar of roasted bell peppers that I chopped up. The salsa I used contained fire-roasted tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes. (Those roasted tomatoes and peppers just add a wonderful flavor.) Instead of plain corn, I used a can of cream-style corn to add some extra thickening. I added a can of cooked chicken just to give it some extra protein and texture. I added a dash of cumin to the chili powder. Finally, when I sampled it, I thought it was way too salty, so I peeled and chopped up a large potato and threw it in to absorb some of the salt. The final result is FANTASTIC!

Where I grew up, you just HAD to have blackeyed peas on New Year's Day -- supposedly for good luck in the new year.  The traditional Southern recipe was little more than the beans in water with ham hocks. But the family I married into does not care much for blackeyed peas, so I always try to fix them some other way. THIS recipe -- with the modifications I mentioned -- is, by far, the very best of my efforts so far! I think I'll just call this my official New Year's Soup and make it every year from now on. And not just on New Year's Day -- this will be a delicious, satisfying, hot treat on any cold winter's day!
