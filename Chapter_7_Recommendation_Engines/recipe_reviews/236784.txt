Awesome! I did use some leftover chicken parmesan that I had on hand, but followed the rest as stated. We really loved the crunch of the bread w/ the cheesy, saucy yummy chicken inside. This was a hit and I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is now my go-to crusted chicken recipe, whether Iâ€™m putting them in Paninis or not. Great recipe!
