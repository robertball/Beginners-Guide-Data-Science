Amazing....family inhaled this dinner...used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of croutons, a green pepper instead of jalepeno, a full 2 lbs of extra lean ground chicken (used no pork), a whole packet of taco seasoning and a Mexican cheese blend in addition to all of the other ingredients. Very moist and extremely tasty. Loved it!

This meatloaf is fabulous!  I made this for dinner the other night and I was not disappointed in the results.  I used herb-seasoned stuffing cubes, because it is what I had on hand.  I used a pound of ground pork along with the ground chicken, so I used a 16 oz jar of salsa.  I also added 2 T. of taco seasoning mix.  I used Chubby's BBQ Sauce so I did not add any brown sugar because the sauce is sweet enough.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I used all chicken and even forgot to add the cheese the second time I made it and didn't miss it!  Make sure you like the salsa you choose because the varieties are so abundant and that can drastically change the flavor.  I used Pace Picante Sauce.

I really didn't know what to expect from a meatloaf using ground chicken and pork, but, wow the taste really packs a punch!   It had so much flavor and tasted really fresh using fresh jalapeno and cilantro.   My ground chicken and pork came in 1 lb. containers.  I noticed that other reviewers used an entire lb. of pork, so, I did to so I didn't have and extra 1/2 lb that I probably wouldn't use.  I added a full 2 tbs. of taco seasoning and 16 oz. salsa to accomodate for the extra pork.  I left everything else the same.  So, so yummy!  It was moist and cooked perfectly in the time listed on the recipe.  I will definitely be making again.   Thanks, HockeyMom!

This is the most incredible meatloaf I've ever eaten. So moist and full of flavor, and the recipe allows so many opportunities to tailor it for your own preferences. I subbed in half a green bell pepper and the rest of the four-blend Mexican cheese I had instead of jalapeno and pepperjack. Because of this, the resulting loaf was a little sweeter, but still incredibly yummy. Next time I'll try to spice it up by using hot salsa instead of the mild I had on hand. Looking forward to playing with this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly...the flavor wasn't bad but the loaf ended up being very wet. I had to cut off the bottom of the loaf and just eat the middle/top part. I may try again, using less salsa and maybe using turkey instead of chicken.

It's great. Living in Cyprus I had to modify some ingredients. I used 1/2 cup chilli cheese and 1/2 cup parmasen. Also half way through, I drained excess moisture as the previous one I mad was too moist. As for flavor it's excellent and something different in eastern mediteranian. ;)

This meatloaf had the most flavor of any meatloaf I have ever had.  It was fairly easy to make, and my wife, a picky eater, really liked it!

I love this recipe, but might not be the best person to review it, as I did make a lot of changes. Mostly because of things I had on hand and others that I didn’t. But I did find that it is a very versatile recipe and lens itself to making these changes and I always appreciate the kind of a recipe a lot. Two of the biggest changes I made were using some hot Italian sausage as part of the mix and adding a bit of extra heat, and using less salsa. The rest of the changes were relatively minor and just came about because of ingredients that I  either did or did not have on hand.

After reading reviews, I made a few alterations. This review is based on my changes: 1 lb of both chicken and pork, 12 oz salsa, one extra T of taco seasoning. I also used cheddar instead of pepperjack based on personal preference. Didn't put on sauce before putting in oven. Baked uncovered 35 min. Took out, drained, added sauce, baked another 35 minutes. Drained again before serving. It was perfect and delicious! At the table, we sprinkled on a seasoning called Tajin Chili Lime Sauce that took it from great to amazing. Next time I make this, I will add 1 T of the Tajin to the mix, too.

Like other reviewers, I had a pound of pork and a pound of chicken, so I used both and added more salsa (16oz), taco seasoning (1 pkg) and croutons (maybe two loose cups). I didn't want to have to cook the onion, garlic and spicy pepper bc my hubby doesn't like onions (they are in the salsa anyway) and I didn't have a pepper. Instead, I added four cloves of fresh minced garlic and a can of green chilies directly to the meat. That was way easier and the meatloaf was really delicious and not too spicy for our toddler.  The cooking time seemed off for me and I guess I would have had to add another 20 min, but since I didn't have time, I nuked each serving.  I took off a star bc 1) my loaf was way too wet, so I would add more croutons in the future and 2) it made a huge mess in my oven! Watch out for that combo of super juicy and BBQ sauce, it drips like mad.  I'll bet the leftovers are fantastic and I will be making this again. Thanks for a great spin on traditional meatloaf!

Hands-down one of the best meatloaf recipes I have tried. Easy to make. I didn't have ground pork, but used hot Italian Sausage taken out of the casing - yum. Even with the jalapeno, not hot - I might put more in next time!!

Family loved it.  Son didn't even use ketchup to enjoy his meatloaf - it had so much flavor and was so moist.  I used all chicken cheddar cheese since I didn't have pepper jack and found it wonderfully moist.  Enjoy!

Excellent! Used oats as I was out of croutons which made this a softer consistency...perfect for an enchilada stuffing!!

You definitely need to add both pork and vegetables to keep the ground chicken from drying out. Meatloaf needs to be moist

This is really delicious and will now be a family staple! We did reduce this to 1lb of just ground chicken since I don’t eat pork. We only used ingredients that we had on hand which was far from all listed but it was still great! Key is draining it at least once during cooking as it is very juicy.

Husband loved it and said it was the best meatloaf ever. Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed tortilla chips. It was a little wet for me.

I used a conglomeration of leftovers to add to my new ingredients to make this yummy meatloaf!   Half of my salsa was the Trader Joe's tomatillo green salsa and the other half was a red salsa from a local place----both "medium" but really quite hot.  My croutons were some of Chef John's from this site that I had in my freezer.  Instead of pork I used a Hillshire kielbasa piece that I had in my freezer that I cut into small pieces.  I didn't use any jalapeno because of what else I'd used.  My taco seasoning was some of what I had on hand (Taco Seasoning I from this site).   I did, however, use the instructions and the rest of the ingredients as called for.  We calmed down the heat of the salsas with a little sour cream when we ate it, and we LOVED it!   It will make either a good leftover meal or great sandwiches for a lunch!  Thanks for our dinner!  I will definitely make this again!

This was fabulous and I can't wait to make it again. I didn't really measure the ingredients, just eyed it. I didn't use the cilantro nor did I make the barbecue sauce topping. I added extra cheese on top when it was done cooking and resting and just dipped in a bit of ketchup. Deeeelish

My kiddos (2 and 6) love this as does everyone else who's tried it. I mostly stick to the recipe except for subbing green peppers for the jalapeños and cutting back on taco seasoning and cheese. I've also made this with only turkey, turkey and chicken, only chicken. It's great every time. The possibilities are endless! Leftovers are awesome too. This is one of my favorite Allrecipes finds.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the loaf came out mushy and the BBQ did not blend well with the Mexican spice flavor.

Very tasty! I made it close to the original, except I subbed fresh whole wheat bread crumbs for the croutons, used all chicken, and eliminated the jalapeno since my salsa was spicy. I cooked it as patties in a fry pan as another viewer suggested. These were so flavorful they did not need any condiments.

I slightly modified the recipe, using ground turkey in the place of chicken and bread crumbs in place of the croutons.   I didn't add brown sugar to the BBQ sauce either, we get enough sugar in everything we eat.  This meatloaf tasted excellent with lots of levels of flavor.  It was very moist.  Also, there wasn't the "shrinkage" you get when using ground burger.  Overall an excellent meal.

OMG...this was amazing...so moist.  Rave reviews from the adults and teens...little ones not so much but they don't like anything but pasta and pizza anyway.... 

I basically followed the recipe although like many others I used 2 lbs of ground chicken and no pork.  I used all the other  ingredients adjusting the quantities because of the additional meat.  I added 4 button mushrooms finely chopped to the onion mixture.   I also added about 1/4c bbq sauce to the meat mixture.  Once all mixed I felt it was a bit watery so I added about another 1.5 cups of croutons that I quickly ground in the  food processor.  This seemed the thicken the mixture to the right consistency.  With these changes I made 2 loafs.  One in a 10 " and one 8".  Served the sweet potato fries  and roasted broccoli.  Can't wait for the left overs tomorrow.

This was AMAZING!
Make sure you let it sit no less than 15 minutes before eating!!!  Let it sit for 20 minutes!
The directions say this by the way!!!
You don't have to drain anything.
In fact, that would be doing yourself a disservice.
Let it cool and harden.
It is moist and delicious.
I just added more seasoning and garlic because I'm a garlic freak, but no changes are needed!!!

This was awesome and everyone devoured it !
I used 1 lb each ground chicken and pork. Used less salsa and about a cup more of seasoned croutons because I didn’t want it too wet.  Also used the entire package of Taco seasoning. 
Did not use loaf pan but free formed it in a 13x9 baking dish lined with foil and baked according to directions . Definitely will be making this again! Loved it!

This was a very interesting flavor.  Much better than  regular meatloaf.   We loved it.  I made it for my husband and for guests and got rave reviews.  Everyone loved it.   And any leftovers you might have are even better the next day.   Great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I used Salsa Verde because it is what I had.
I made little ones instead of one big meatloaf and
will freeze them.  I had one last night and it was so good.
I'll be making this again for sure.

The only thing I omitted was the jalapeno  pepper so everyone could enjoy the meal. My husband always uses a salsa with ghost pepper, so he didn't miss the jalapeno.

This was good but different as I've never had a chicken meat loaf before.  Like other reviewers, I agreed it was too soupy so I  felt the need to add more breadcrumbs .  Unfortunately I only had Italian breadcrumbs so that is what I used.  Lol.  The cilantro is what gives it that Mexican taste as I could not really taste the taco seasoning.  It was not hot with one jalapeno.  Surprisingly it had a lot of flavor.  Don't leave off the BBQ sauce as that is much needed on the top.

I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy.  This isn't bad, but ground chicken wasn't easy to find in my area and wasn't any less expensive than ground beef, so I don't think I'll make this one again.  I may very well try making "taco meatloaf" with ground beef, using this as a starting point though.

This is a fabulous meatloaf!  Probably the best I've ever had since I have not been a fan of meatloaf.  I used ground turkey and one link of Italian sausage.  I did not have the garlic, worcestershire sauce or cilantro but it was still delicious.  I also crushed the croutons under the salsa after letting it sit for a while and before I mixed everything else in.  I used whatever cheese we already had.  I am making it again with ground chicken and without cheese to see if it turns out as good.

This was outstanding!  Most chicken or turkey meatloafs, that I have tried, were bland.  This will become a frequent flyer in our house! Thanks!
