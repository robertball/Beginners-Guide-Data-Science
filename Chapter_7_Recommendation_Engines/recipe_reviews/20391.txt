Very good. I cut the whole recipe in half and added 1tblspn each of garlic powder and onion powder and just a touch of cayanne pepper. I rubbed (very liberaly!) 8 pcs of 1 1/2 inch thick chops and have enough left over for at least two more applications to chicken or ribs later! The chops got rave reviews!

This recipe is AWESOME! As I was mixing the ingredients together, I thought that this would also be a great recipe to make and put in a mason jar as a present for someone who enjoys cooking out on the grill.

I can't stop putting this rub on all my pork BBQing.  We love it.  I make double or triple batches and keep it in a ziploc bag.  I noticed that it's not always as good as the first time I mix it up, so now I always take out what I need and add some fresh Brown sugar to the mix.  Then it's just perfect!  Thanks.

excellent.  I used it on boneless chicken breasts.  I brushed the chicken with garlic oil first (kept it very moist) put the rub on, and then grilled it on the george foremen.  I absolutely loved this recipe and will be making it again and again!

I had never tried a dry rub before.  This was sensational!  I used it on pork chops and then grilled.  My family loved it.  I did cut back on the salt and pepper, as others recommended.  I also used a little less paprika and added 1/4 cup garlic powder.  Will definitely use this one again.

I tried this last night with pork steaks.  I let them sit a few minutes with the rub and then we added some bottled BBQ Sauce the last 5 minutes of grilling. They were a big hit.  My husband wants them again this weekend!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This made the most heavenly spiced country style pork ribs. I dry rubbed the ribs and let them stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking. It is also great on baked pork chops and the cooking liquid makes a spicy gravy that hits the spot! This will become a regular dish at my house!

Awesome recipe! Simple and delicious! I've made them many many times already. Tastes really great with chicken wings and especially delicious on baby ribs. Just rub on, wrap in aluminium foil and bake. There is however not enough of the wonderful meat juice. Putting on more rub doesn't give more juice either; it just gets overpowering. I usually go with the ratio of 5:5:2:1:1:1 (brown sugar - white sugar - salt - black pepper - paprika powder - garlic powder). The garlic powder is pretty important. I gotta memorise that, because people keep asking for it. I also like to add some dried parsley (but it actually only adds to the visual appeal). Thanks Cindy!

There is a heck of a lot of this rub to store after use, and I didn't enjoy it that much -- neither did my husband. But, hey, it's good to try new things! I just found it had an overly peppery taste, where my husband thought it was overly sweet...? It also made a lot of juice come out of the meat once it was rubbed in and sat in the fridge for a few minutes... is that normal?

Very easy rub to make. I really didn't think to much about the taste of it but my family tells me my taste buds are gone because I use to many hot spices. I used this rub on baby backs, covered them in foil and left them in the refrigerator overnight, slow roasted in the oven and grilled 10 minutes on the grill. My family said that they were "THE BEST RIBS EVER ATE". I'm doing it again today. P.S. - Added some garlic powder also.

This is an AWESOME rub!!  It's so easy for the "rub challenged" like myself.  A gourmet cook...I am not, but I found myself liking the ribs more than any of the restaurant ribs that I have had.  I used Kristy's recipe for ribs and they were DELICIOUS!!!    

Depending on how many ribs you're making (I made about 3 pounds of bone-in spare ribs) I would follow this recipe and then divide in half.  Use half of the recipe and store the other half.

IT IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!

Thanks Cindy!

made this for a causal BBQ, and i had my doubts cos i watch license to grill and that dude adds LOTS of flavor, and marinades his meat for like forever. husband grilled this one to PERFECTION. i only marinaded it for like 2 hrs. and slathered tony roma's bbq sauce over it while it was cooking off the heat. meat was tender and it was gone in a flash. good stuff! gave me the confidence to experiment more! :)

I must say that was the best Pork Steak I have ever grilled. When I went looking for something to liven up my steaks and found this recipe I knew it had to be great. The only draw back with the kids is too much pepper. I will definately use this rub many times over with a little adjustment on the pepper. Overall it was fantastic!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.~CT

This was very good. I scaled it down to six servings and rubbed on chicken breasts before grilling. My husband and 10-year old just loved it! I did think it needed some garlic, so I added 2 TB. of garlic powder. Delicious! The one other thing I will change next time is to add some cayenne for heat. We like spicy.

This was DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe as written (scaled down to 6- covered 8 chicken legs perfectly with a little left over).  I'll be using this for all of our BBQ chicken and pork from now on.

Unlike most people, I used it on chicken...Very good rub...I suggest you cut down on the black pepper if you don't like spicy foods. Also, I added garlic powder to the mix. Only let it marinate for aprox 10 mins due to time constraints and it was still great. Thx Cindy

My father was skeptical when I wanted to use this recipe on the pork ribs he bought since he never had dry rub on meat, but after taking a few bites he had changed his mind. I agree since the ribs were fantastic. I recommend anyone who wants a dry rub recipe to use this once since it's fantastic and doesn't use esoteric ingredients.

Wow!  Awesome flavor!  Instead of grilling the pork ribs, I made them with the BBQ dry rub in my rotisserie.  Everyone loved the ribs!  People were asking for more ribs and forgetting about the grilled chicken.  I definitely will use this BBQ dry rub again!!!!  Thanks.

This is a great recipe. I just wanted to add two things.  1. If the rub is clumping, burning, or getting sticky you probably have large pieces of brown sugar. Mix the brown sugar into the rub in stages and make sure you crush any large chunks or they will burn.  2. Try cutting the salt and pepper by 25% each. If you still think it is too much then cut a total of 50%. Try replacing whatever you take one with a 4:4:1 mix of onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin. It worked for me.

This one is for keeps. Tastes great and adds a wonderful color to the meat. I keep a sprinkle bottle of it with my everyday spices too.

This is SOOOOO GOOOD.  We try it on chicken wings tonight and it was the best ever.  My kids couldn't get enough of it.  I added a tbsp of onion powder and 1 tbsp of garlic powder to the rub.

This is the first rub I have ever tried and I was very happy with the way it turned out. I tried it on Pork Chops and there is no doubt I will be doing it again!

Wow, I used this recipe on a salmon filet and it was awesome.  I'm not a huge salmon fan and I thought it was going to be too fishy since it didn't marinate at all.  I put on the rub, cooked it on a George Foreman grill, and it was GREAT.  I added 1 tsp of ground flaxseed to the rub for added omega 3's, and it was so good.  Will definitely be using this recipe a LOT!  Thanks.

Who knew?  I've never before used a dry rub but thought I'd take a chance.  My grilled chops always turn out dry & flavorless but not today!  This was so easy and left my chops juicy and delicious.  I always thought you had to add lots & lots of BBQ sauce but there was absolutely no need with this rub.  We'll be having this again and again and again.  Thanks.

Amazing results!  When I first mixed the ingrediants together I was a little skeptical.  But boy was I wrong!  I put the rub on a large tri-tip and once it sat on the grill for about 5 minutes it carmilized perfectly, and the smell - yum!!  It had that perfect blend of sweet and spice to make the tri-tip mouth watering.  Can't wait to try it on chicken!!

I really liked the way thos turned out! I used it on boneless pork chops and i broiled them. (too cold to turn the grill on) It smelled like barbque sauce when it was cooking. I can't wait to use it on ribs! And i definitley can't wait to grill more pork! I used less than half of the pepper and it still came great!

Don't forget to add 2 T garlic powder, 1T onion powder. I like to dry rub them SPARINGLY the night before & store in the fridge (like a marinade, but without all the liquid). Then shortly before grilling take them out and dry rub them again.

I made a small amount of this rub at first and to my surprise, used it up within days. I have made a much larger batch and keep it with my other spices, since I'm often grilling meat. I've used it on beef, pork and chicken (rubbed with oil prior to putting the rub on as another reviewer suggested) with nothing less than amazing results.

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would. We absolutely LOVED this. The only suggestion I would make is to cut the salt to a quarter of a cup (if you are sodium sensitive). But,otherwise..YUM!!

Great rub for chicken or pork.  I changed the recipe just a bit, by increasing the pepper & paprika, and adding 1/4 cup each of garlic powder & onion powder.  It does a wonderful job of seasoning meat.

Really good recipe for the grill.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.  Grilling formed a really nice crust on the outside and a moist meat on the inside.  Great flavor and very easy to do.

I have officially been upgraded to possible wife status by my boyfriend.  I used this rub on the "Baby Back Ribs" recipe from this site and was just blown away.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. Update:  my boyfriend is now my fiance, and I still use this rub EVERY time.  It is a little heavy on the pepper (the men love that!), but those who are a little pepper-hesitant.. I cut it in 1/2 and replace it with garlic powder.  Still fabulous.

I can't rave enough about this recipe.  This is now a mainstay in our household and company asks for the recipe too.  Rubbed into boneless chops for grilling is our favorite way to use it.  It is quite spicy -so our kids aren't as nuts about it as us.  That's okay -we'll throw hamburgers on for them and eat the chops. :)

Fabulous on cedar plank salmon.  Rub olive oil on top and bottom of both salmon and cedar plank(soaked in water at least 2 hrs).  Use dry rub both over top and under salmon.  The basic flavor of the rub perfectly complements the subtle flavor imparted by the cedar.  Sooo good!

We have used this rub on chicken for almost three years now.  We first pound chicken breasts very thin, then rub them with olive oil(with minced garlic mixed into it), rub with the dry rub, let sit for a few minutes, then grill.  It is AWESOME!  We have served this so many times entertaining and everyone loves it!  We make this monthly, except for a time when we didn't have a grill, and then we missed it alot!

Made the recipe as written just halved it.  I thought it was going to be extremely sweet but I admit I was wrong. Rubbed it sparingly on our pork steaks about 1 hour prior to grilling and I didn't even use BBQ sauce on mine.  The whole family loved it.

Love it Love it I took a large pork loin and rolled and cut it to where it was 2 ½ foot in length. Sprinkled this fantastic rub on the inside and the rolled the pork loin back into original form and then coated the outside of the loin put it on the smoker and smoked it with pecan wood. When it was finished and cut it look like a pork cinnamon roll… Best I ever had people went nuts. update : I have made quite a few times and in big volume I found if you half the salt measurement and replace it with half garlic powder and the other half onion power the salt that seems to over power is at a comfortable level with a little extra flavor from the garlic and onion that was added

This is good enough like it is, that I've adopted it and adapted it with my own touches to make it my own: Garlic, onion, and chipotle powders. YUM!!!

Decent.  I made this rub because my husband loves BBQ and it was so basic.  However, I did some other on-line searches and saw that most dry rubs are essentially the same, but many added other spices, so, I took some liberties with this recipe.    I added pinch(es) of garlic powder, chili powder, paprika and ground red pepper.    Also, I marinated the chicken in the dry rub for about 2 hours (just b/c I had the time on this particular day).  Just before cooking, I loosed the skin and rubbed the meat with extra dry rub.    With about 3 minutes left of cooking, I dropped a healthy dollop of store bought bbq sauce (we use "Sweet Baby Ray's" original) on each piece, I think that was a huge improvement.   I would make this again but, I'd play with the spices again.

MUST TRY!  I've used this recipe many times for pork, beef, chicken, fish.  Best salmon I've ever had from the grill and also best pork shoulder roast.

I absolutely love this rub!  I made it according to the recipe a couple months ago, and have used it on steak, pork and chicken.  I just ran out and I am going to make more!  It is the perfect balance of sugar and spice and everyone loves it!

My mom and I had a competition last night and I was declared the hands down winner with this rub.  I cut it down quite a bit to 5 servings and still had some left over which I am going to try on salmon, as per another review.  Excellent savory and sweet rub!


Update:  I tried this on chicken leg quarters with the skin removed and my husband re-proposed to me when we were done!  :-)

I tried this on pork ribs and have to say it was a little too salty.  Other than that though, the flavor was very good and I will definitely try it again--just with less salt!

I have been on a quest for years to perfect the art of slow cooked BBQ. This is very similar to the rub i have been using for years. Just add 1/4 cup of Onion powder and you will have the Best BBQ Dry rub on the planet. Try this on Grilled pork chops and wow your guests. I Guarantee they will want the recipe before they leave. I usually marinate the pork in this rub for a min of 3 hours in the fridge. Remember to let the meat hit room temperature BEFORE you grill or BBQ.

Warning: Makes a LARGE batch and if you don't like it, you will have a lot of waste. I used it on pork ribs and it was too salty! Also, the rub dried the meat out something terrible.  It was like eating jerky.

I have been using this rub for at least a year or more and just got around to reviewing it.  I personally think this is great.  It makes a lot and you can store the leftovers in a sealed container and use as needed.

I first used this recipe on ribs and it was ok, but not quite what I expected. Next I used it on a pork shoulder roast that was stuffed with garlic and it turned out awesome. Everyone was raving about how good the roast was with the rub on it. Now I only use it on roasts!

This was excellent! After reading all of the reviews (thank you folks!) I used slightly less than 1/4 cup pepper, and added approximately 1/4 cup garlic powder and 2 tsp. cayenne pepper. I rubbed my sliced pork loin and let it marinate in the fridge for approximately 4 hours and then baked in the oven; very tasy and moist! I still have enough mix left over to do some chicken next week! Thank you for the post :)

The best!!!!! I never could come up with a good seasoning for ribs and I came across this one and for the first time, my ribs were the best at my family cookout and it was the talk of the cookout. I did let the ribs sit overnight before grilling. also no sauce was needed

I've used this recipe several times.  It makes all the difference in making great barbeque.  I've also used it on pork loin.  It makes your meat so tender.  Just follow the recipe.

This receipe will replace all rubs,barbeque sauces used ever used starting from now on.  I put my ribs on the top rack of my grill and they came out mmmm, mmmm, good.  When I made it 3 more times and my propane ran out, I through my ribs in my oven.  This was the best mistake I could have made.  The sugars, salt melted in such an even way, far better than the grill.  The meat was much moister too.  I've added 1/4 cup garlic powder to the receipe since I can't live without it and made it 3 more times.  I have people asking me for my "family" secret receipe.  I don't have the heart to tell them I down loaded it and added 1/4 cup of garlic powder. Enjoy!!

This is a wonderful dry rub. I tried it on some steaks and they had great flavor! I only made 1/4 a recipe in case I didn't like it, but it IS very good! It also seems to store well in a tightly closed jar. Good post!

I made this rub to give as gifts at Christmas and have heard nothing but rave reviews from the recipients. The only thing I did differently was use smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. It gave the rub a wonderful, smoky flavour. So good.

Used this for grilling a couple of pork roasts for wraps and they turned out fantastic.  Tweaked it a little bit by adding about a 1/4 cup of chili powder, but this recipe is great!

I discovered this recipe today. Made it, ate it, and loved it!!! My husband and I devoured a whole rack of pork ribs. It was an insane feeding frenzy. We usually don't go from civilized to animal-like when at the dinner table, but we never cooked tasty ribs like this either.  I have to admit that I did follow the suggestions of several other reviewers by adding other seasonings. My husband and I have a palate for bold flavors. So, I experimented with all sorts of spices that I had in my spice rack (tandori spices, chipotle spices, chili powder, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, and season salt).   I ran a taste test to compare how this recipe would stand up to two store-bought dry rubs (Porky's Memphis Dry Rub and McCormick's Grill Mate's Pork Rub). By far, this recipe beat out the competition. The sweet, salty flavors just enhanced the meat. We literally could not wait to take the next bite.  I recommend this recipe to all. I also recommend experimenting with several spices to cater to your taste.

This is a great rub recipe.  After reading reviews I added 1 Tablespoon onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, plus 1 teaspoon chili powder.  It is perfect and I just had to make another batch!

My husband could not stop raving about this rub.  He loved the pants right off of it.  I would give it a 4 or 4.5, just because I'm not as big a fan of the sweet taste right off the bat, but it has a nice lingering zing to it, which I like a lot.

Excellent rub for pork, at a fraction of the cost of what a dry rub would cost at the store. I used coarse sea salt instead of table salt, and as with any rub with high salt content, do not apply this rub any more than 15 minutes before cooking the meat. 

With this sweet rub I let the meat smoke for a couple of hours until the rub forms a crust, then use a spray bottle to spray apple juice over the meat every 30 minutes or so until it is finished cooking.

This was great!  It makes a lot and keeps well in a sealed containter. I made it for babybacks but had so much leftover that I tried it on steak.  I grilled it and it came out fantastic.  I don't think it tenderizes the meat but sure gives it a sweet/salty flavor. A keeper that I'll use often.  I think I'll try it on the fresh salmon my hubby caught this morning.  :-]

Very delicious!  I was kind of rushed so I parboiled the country style ribs for 10 minutes, let them cool slightly and then rubbed them.  I let them sit on the counter for about 10 minutes and then grilled them for about 10 minutes to finish them off.  They were tasty and tender.  Next time I will probably try to use the rub as intended.

Great, fast and easy. Next time, I'll reduce the salt by half because it was just a tad bit salty for me, but everyone else  loved it.  Will surely use this rub again... Thanks!

Whatever you do...add this one to your recipe box!  It was so, so good! Last night I made burritos. I took strips of beef, sprinkled the mixture over the meat and let it sit for about twenty minutes before cooking. I made a side of a spicy type rice and a side of black beans mixed with corn and added a touch of chili powder...a few dashes of hot sauce and a few tablespoons of barbecue sauce. We added all to our burritos...along with mexican shredded cheese,sour cream and the fabulous beef strips. I can't tell you...just how good it really was. Give this one a try and I am sure you will be raving about it too  :)

sooo good. I reduced the recipe so I could use it on the hamsteak I had. I mixed together 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 2 tsp of paprika. Rubbed that on each side of the hamsteak that I'd sprinkled generously w/ salt and pepper. Let it sit while I was heating up the frying pan, sprayed w/ a little olive oil cooking spray. Cooked the hamsteak (these come in a pack of 3 at Costco and each one serves 4) for 3 minutes on each side. This came together soooo fast and was really good. Served w/ rolls and a salad for terrific, easy meal!

All I can say is EXCELLENT.  Soooo good!  Had it on boneless ribs and can't wait to try it on other meats.  Will probably have it again tomorrow night.  THANKS Cindy.

Delicious once I figured out how to cut back on the spices! I had made it once before, and everyone loved it, but it was way to hot! So today I made a 10 serving size and cut back on the pepper. Much better!!!! I added some paprika, onion powder and garlic powder. This one is a keeper for sure!!! Put it on pork tenderloins and grilled them, yum!!!! Will try on chicken next time!

This rub is awesome! It's so versatile. I've used it on chicken, pork tenderloin, steak...delicious! It's a quick flavor boost alternative to marinating.

The rub is actually really good.  I only did 6 servings and added 2tsp of onion powder and garlic powder.  i rubbed it in my pork really well, let it sit, and rub in some more.  I had 4 country rib pork and still had a bunch of left over rub left.  We grilled our pork and it was delicious.

Scaled it down to do a test batch on a couple chicken breasts. I added some garlic powder and a dash of cumin. No heat on this one but it was very good with an overnight marinade. Will definitely prepare it in larger quantity next time I do a large pork butt for pulled pork.

an awesome recipe. i used it on sirloin steak and my family absolutely love it. it is quickly becoming a favourite in our household...i did take advice from other peoples reviews such as halfing the recipe and adding garlic powder....i also experimented a little bit by adding bbq seasoning and a hint of curry powder. the next day we had burger and the left over dry rub i put on top of the meat patties while they baked in the oven. was amazing (like having a teriyaki/bbq burger) and a great way to use the leftover dry rub

This rub was incredible! I tweaked it a little: cut back the sugars to 1 cup each and added 2 tablespoons each of garlic powder and onion powder. Rubbed the mixture on deer steaks, wrapped them in bacon and cooked on the grill - turned out great! Plan to use on chicken, pork and beef.

This rub was awesome. We had 2 racks of ribs and used maybe 25-33% of the rub.  Next time I will cut the salt, but other than that it was great and did not taste sugary at all on the final product. I also added some garlic powder and cayenne (~1 tbs each), as suggested in the other reviews.

I tried this rub on the fly when I ran out of the one I usually use, and was missing ingredients to make more... I used it for Boneless Skinless Chix Breasts. I gotta tell  y'all, this one does the trick!  It was just the right mix of salty and sweet, and even had a bit of tangyness in there.  The only thing I will do differently when I make the next batch is add a TINY bit of powdered smoke to it.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used the rub on one chicken breast just to see what the rub would end up tasting like. I covered both sides of the breast with the rub and baked it (it's raining tonight and so the grill was not an option.) The flavor was good... spicier than I expected but my guy roommates liked the spice. I will try this again but add garlic, onion salt, and some additional seasoning into the rub mix and maybe decrease the amount of pepper. I'll try it 'as is' though on steak and pork just to see because chicken may not have done this rub justice. :)

This is really good - used about half the salt recipe called for. We put it on boneless pork chops and grilled, next time we plan to try it on chicken. It's a very easy rub to have on-hand for last minute meals.

I used this recipe on ribs and chicken. Rave reviews from everyone. The only thing that I done different was to use Kosher salt instead of table salt, it seems to work better for me. Very good recipe and it makes enough to share with someone else! Thanks for posting this recipe.

We made pork ribs and they came out moist and tender and delicious!  We rubbed half with this rub and left it on for a few hours before adding bottled BBQ sauce which marinated all night.  The other half we did not use the rub, only the BBQ sauce.  Both were great but I think the ones WITH the rub were a little more tender and had a better flavor.  We wrapped them very well in thick foil and placed them on a large sheet pan and still managed to have drippings in the bottom of the oven --they give off a lot of liquid, which we ended up draining about 30 minutes before we pulled them out of the oven.  Overall great result!

This is a perfect base rub for experimenting. I used this rub when smoking ribs and received rave reviews from my family and friends when paired with a store bought bbq sauce. I cut the salt in half and added the removed quantity in onion and garlic powder.

This was a delicious way to grill pork chops. The rub turned into a beautiful sweet glaze with a slight peppery kick to it. I grilled my chops 5 min on each side on high heat covered and they came out great!

my first dry rub - usually just season meat a bit then add store-bought bbq sauce at the end. I made this rub to go with a pork roast, grilled over indirect heat. it was AWESOME. no need for bbq sauce! ( which is really saying something)  i cant wait to bbq again, this time will make more to save in a container for next time

This rub really adds great flavor to chicken and ribs (especially done in the smoker)!  Followed recipe except for cutting back slightly on the salt.

What an amazing base rub! I rubbed it on pork ribs and added some raspberry vinaigrette. Cranked up the oven to 400F and half an hour later - moist, delicious ribs. I can't wait to try out the remainder with the different combinations in the other reviews!

Amazing!  I made this awhile ago but hadn't had a chance to use it until last night when I put it on some pork sirloin chops.  Unbelievable!  Delicious!  ETA:  Try adding some crushed red pepper and chipotle chili powder to help step up that heat a tiny bit more.  And if you can get smoke paprika, it is even better.

This rub was awesome.  I just finished eating my grilled chicken using this rub.  It was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to try this on ribs.  I did use one variation.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Just my preference.  This will be MY rub from now on.  Somehow I get the feeling that I'm gonna tell my friends I thought of it.  LOL. THANKS ALL RECIPES!

I doubled this recipe so we can keep it on hand and not have to make it every time we want to use it.  Keeps great in a Tupperware-type container.  We used this rub on chicken that we grilled and then added a little to hamburgers that we grilled a few nights later.  Very good rub - can't wait to use it on ribs the next time we make them.

My husband, who usually does the ribs, even gave me a complement on this one.  While we usually go for spicy, it was nice to have a break and just enjoy the flavor of the ribs.  I might add a little cayenne next time, but this is an aweseome basic rub.  I'll keep it on hand for sure.

This is an excellent recipe.  The pork chops had a very nice flavor and were very juicy.  I had cut the pepper required in half and it was still a little too peppery for my taste, which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.

It definitely has a paprika taste...not my favorite.  I also would cut the pepper in half--it was spicy enough with just 1/8 cup.  :)

This was my first time grilling with a rub and I'm glad I tries this recipe. Steaks and chicken breasts were great. I did add garlic powder like someone suggested and I also added some chipotle powder because I liked the smokey, spicy kick it gave the meat. Thank you for the recipe I did make the whole batch, I used half and the other is in an air tight container because I'll be using it again soon.

Excellent rub which gives a wonderful taste to pork or chicken.  If I were to do it again, I would reduce the quantity of pepper - I found it somewhat hot.

This is a great rub. I used it on both chicken and pork and it was great! I made the recipe  "as-is" first and I liked it. But, I do like a little heat. So I added :  1/4 cup more brown sugar. and I added 1 Tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper & Paprika. and that did the trick... for ME. It had just a nice subtle heat to it. but not enough for the kids not to like it.

Imparts a great taste to the ribs I used it on. Coupled with a generous dose of hickory in the pellet grill, all I can say is awesome!

Reaaalllly good. But...you don' need the salt at all - I just cut it out entirely. And I used Splenda for baking in place of sugar, Splenda brown sugar blend in place of brown sugar (you do have to use half of the amount). 

What I did was rub it on boneless skinless chicken breast halves and grill them on the Foreman for five minutes :)

And it wasn't too spicy for my scoville-naive husband ;)

We liked this rub, but there was too much pepper which made it way too spicy for my 8 yr old son and it was even too spicy for us (and we love spicy food). That's why I gave it a 3 star. The flavor was good and I will make this again, but next time I will add a lot less pepper.

I had a few leftover boneless pork chops and this looked like a great rub to try.  The yield on the recipe looked like far more than I needed so I broke it down by parts so I could make as little or as much as necessary.  1 part paprika, 1 part black pepper, 2 parts salt, 5 parts brown sugar, 5 parts white sugar.  I also added 1 part mesquite grill smoky rub seasoning.  Took the pork chops out of the refrigerator and rubbed the mix on both sides and let it sit to come to room temperature before cooking them on the skillet.  The family's response, "OMG, that's SOOO good!" Definitely making this again and will try it with other cuts of pork and other meats.

Delicious!  Quick and easy.  Tastes better than a famous rib restaurant's.  So finger-lickin' good you won't need any sauce.  It's a staple in my pantry.  I have a quart size jar of this mix on the shelf always, ready and waiting for the next grilling.

This is excellent!  I used it on boneless country style ribs.  Just the right amount of sweet and tangy.  My kids even loved it.  I ended up halving the recipe and applying liberally to the ribs.  Then I let them rest in the fridge for an hour before grilling.  I still have plenty of rub left over for another meal or two.  I can't wait to make it again.

This was great. I cut the serving size to a fourth of the original recipe, cut the salt by half and added a Tbs of garlic and onion powder per some of the other reviews. I also used smoked paprika instead of regular. I thought it was great! I used it on boneless pork chops. I let them warm up to room temperature, I slathered the rub on as thick as I could get it, waited another ten minutes and grilled them normally. My fiancée loved it!  I ended up with some left overs I want to try on some country style ribs. Don't forget to pat your meat dry with paper towels before applying the rub.

I have used this recipe several times on steak and pork and it works great. Easy to make and these are items that most everyone already has in their pantry.  I would caution you that when its used on the grill it leaves a sugar coating behind but it's easily burned off.

I subbed in maple syrup for brown sugar simply because I didn't have any of the latter and rubbed the paste onto thick cut pork chops before grilling. I have never enjoyed a chop so much in my entire life. This one is a keeper for sure, and i can see no reason to swap out the maple syrup if you happen to have it. Thanks for this one!

So delicious!  I made this for a dinner for 10 and I only had a small amount left over - definitely cut the recipe if you're not making that much (I made about 12 pork chops).  The results were so delicious & the best part is no hours of marinating to get this delicious flavor!

Loved this Spice Rub except a bit too much Pepper for me. I followed the recipe as it should be without changes.. Next time I will hold back on a tad of pepper. Thanks for a great rub! I would use this on Chicken also.

I was half way through mixing everything together and discovered I had no paprika.  I decided to "take a chance" and substituted chili powder instead.  I had no idea how it would turn out - so I did a little less than 1/4 cup (I think it was between 1/8 and 1/4). I also added about the same portion of black pepper too (my family is not "super spicy". By my surprise - it turned out FANTASTIC.  the flavor had a sweet smokey flavor and a hint of "heat" from the chili powder at the end.  My daughter, who does not like BBQ sauce, LOVED IT.  it was very tasty.

I have used this several times as a dry rub on pork chops but tonight added Montreal Steak Seasoning in place of the pepper! It was even better! I used it on beef ribs generously, baked at 225 degrees for 5 hours with peach juice and water with on top of sliced onion, then put on the grill with BBQ sauce for 10 minutes. The best we'd ever had. Our guests said we should enter it in a contest for the best Beef Ribs ever!

Very good! Used it on pork chops that I grilled on the Foreman grill. I liked the sweetness/saltiness in this. Adjusted the amount for 8 servings and still made a lot, I ended storing the rest for next time. I think I will try it on salmon next time!

I used this on boneless baby back ribs and let it sit in the fridge for several hours, then grilled it.  It was unbelievable!  I pared the recipe to 6 servings and cut back a little on the pepper and paprika so my kids would eat it, too.  This has tons of flavor!

Lets just put it this way. I have used this rub on everything. Only thing I didn't care for was on beef. I do add some garlic but other than that I can't tell you how many people have wanted the recipe. I even deep fried a whole pork loin marinated in this rub. Outside turns black due to the sugar but tastes awesome. Thanks

So good!  I first used this for some thick pork chops, which were good, but my husband burned them a little.  First time we had grilled pork.  Last night we used it with country-style pork ribs, and it was a real winner!  My husband declared it the best he'd ever had and so did our neighbor.  Thanks for sharing it.

I tried this with chicken breasts I had cut into larger strips and grilled.  They had good flavor, but were slightly dry.

This was wonderful! The brown sugar made a great glaze over the chicken breasts. I scaled down this recipe to eight servings and made them for my family. I will be keeping this recipe to put on other types of meat too.

I must be missing something here, it had no flavor, and basically burned all over the grill!

This was wonderful!  Made it with country-style pork ribs and wow!  Slightly sweet, very good flavor. Meat was tender and juicy.  Sugars burned a bit on the grill, but could be probably avoided by turning more.  Yum!  I did halve the recipe though, as I didn't need a lot sitting around.  I'm looking forward to trying the rest with other meats.

I bought a BBQ/smoker for my non-cooking husband for fathers day and his first brisket we chose this rub. We added 1/4 C garlic powder and rubbed it on and left it for 3 days to marinate, rubbed a bit more on before smoking it(mesquite wood).  It turned out AWESOME! My friends couldn't believe he did it on his own. Next time I would not marinate- great flavour!!

Superb! Great flavor. Wonderful when you don't want a "messy" BBQ sauce. Put this on ribs. Next time I will try chicken and a pork tenderloin.
