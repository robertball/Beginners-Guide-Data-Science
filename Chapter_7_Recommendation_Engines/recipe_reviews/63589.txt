I like this recipe even though I only used 2 cups of sugar (thats all I had) and substituted 5 whole cloves because I coudn't find clove oil. Next time I'll try more cloves...unless I find that clove oil.:)

I had some beets from our organic farmers market we have on the beach every week. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings because I only bought enought to try a recipe. This recipe reminds me the way my Mom use to make beets when I was a child. Good and simple way to make beets, but I couldn't convince my kids to eat it.

Great recipe but why am I saving 2 1/2 cups of the water from the beets? What do I do with it after I save it?

Beth, you use the reserved beet water in the brine solution. The recipe doesn't say that, but if you check other recipes you'll find that they usually use the beet water.

I did not have lemon juice or clove oil. I used a mixed spice. They turned out great I cant stop eatting them. I will make again but will use the other Ingredients. I did not have mason jars so I used plastic containers. I let it cool a bit first before I packed them.
