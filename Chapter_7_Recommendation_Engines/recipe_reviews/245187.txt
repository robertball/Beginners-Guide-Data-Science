I had already cooked my ground beef when I realized I did not have any chili. So I substituted homemade refried beans and cheddar cheese. I filled the tortillas with the ground beef/refried bean mixture.  I mixed the soup with sour cream and salsa,  covered the burritos with the mixture and then topped them off with more cheddar cheese. Very good, family ate them all.

this recipe fill way short of the ingredients need to fill the tortilla   and i used the 10 in size i had to fry up more ground beef because after mixing ground beef and chili  there was not enough to fill the burritos and have any filling at all for the bottom of the pan as the recipe said, there was no fixing it because i bought what the recipe said for amounts, 19.00 dollars later i made do with what i had.
