This is delicious! And easy to prepare. So tasty! I omit the fish sauce and lemon grass and I have used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added extra cabbage and sprouts. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.

AWESOME! I didnt have any lemon grass so i didn't use any. I like my stuff sour so i added 2 more dashes of vinegar. I also used the lite version of soy sauce to cut back on the salt. I didnt have black pepper so I used white pepper.. I didnt use a whole tablespoon just about between 1/2 and 3/4 tbs. It smelled the rest of the soup so i added more garlic powder, minced and about 2 cups of the broth mixture. I accidently added a lil too much red pepper than i wanted so i scooped some out and cooked the chicken in the soup and used one small onion. Will definately make again and I will try to thicken it with arrowroot and water since most hot and sour soups at the restuarants are thick.

I thought I'd add that you can find fish sauce (sometimes called nam pla) in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets.  I don't remember it as being particularly expensive.

Very nice soup. Just what I was looking for! I'm eating it right now and it feels so good in my belly on a cold winter night. I followed the recipe except my grocer didn't have any bean sprouts today, so I'll have to try that next time. I also added one kefir lime leaf and cilantro instead of parsley because I prefer it. And I cooked the whole thing in my crock pot adding the egg and cilantro at the very end. Thanks for posting this wonderful soup recipe.

This is a great recipe.I didn't put parsley and  I made it with out the chicken because I used it as a side dish. Try really hard to find lemon grass, to me is very important , and the fish sauce too.
I added some dried mushrooms.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

With the addition of thickener(I used arrowroot starch, about 3 TBSP to keep it gluten free), this was an amazing soup that actually tasted very close to the "Chinese restaurant" version, albeit more healthy, and more flavorful.  I make my own chicken broth by boiling down a chicken carcass; it creates a rich, nourishing broth.

Not sour enough, not hot enough.  Added more vinegar, soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce for hot and sour. Don't bother w/ lemon grass-  Left out egg also.  Excellent! Parsley is NEVER used in Hot and sour soup!

Tasty and satisfying.  For my palate, it needed more vinegar and hot pepper flakes.  I am not sure how much more I added, just kept adding until it was right for me.  Double of both if I had to guess. 
I used bok choy instead of cabbage, only because that is what I had on hand.  I added a pack of shitake mushrooms, and used Thai basil instead of parsley.

I was a bit skeptical about making this - seemed like an odd combination of Hot and Sour meets Tom Yum meets Egg Drop soup. I was right! Apart from omitting the parsley, I made it as written initially, and it was pretty decent (not too sure about the cabbage though). Then I added a Tbsp of Tom Yum soup paste which really gave it some oomph. I really liked other reviewers' suggestions of adding cilantro and grated carrot too. Thanks!

great! lots of sodium though.... I made my own chicken stock from a carcass we just finished, skimmed off the fat, and used the baked chicken scraps for the meat. boiled some "bean thread" for noodles and added ginger and broccoli. love the hot and sour broth! A real winner.

I didn't have any lemon grass or parsley, and used balsamic vinegar instead, but it still turned out great, even if perhaps not as intended.

This is a great simple recipe that tastes delicious. The prep time is exaggerated. I used some leftover stock and turkey breast from Thanksgiving and it ended up taking about 20 minutes from start to finish.  I like it with a bit more "sour" to it than as written, but that's a personal preference. I also like someone else's suggestion of adding Tom Yum paste and cilantro; haven't tried it yet, but I will on my next one.

It's taken me about a month to finally rate this soup but I have to say it is excellent. I had never used egg to drizzel over a soup before and was a little leery but it looked and tasted fantastic. A real keeper.

Very good soup!! Excellent for a Weight Watchers choice.
I used Bok Choy as I didn't have regular cabbage.
Also I used lemon pepper instead of the lemon grass.

I substituted a lot in this recipe and it turned out great. I used lime instead of lemon and sparkling cider because i had no red wine vinegar and its just a tenderizer anyways. shredded the chicken, just extra of both of the lime and cider because i had no lemon grass, added the seasonings plus a little extra.  oh and the extra egg or two. This dish had a lot of chunk in it with all the extra i had but i would take out less of the water for it or more stuffing. personally i dont think there should be too much broth at the end of a water based soup- cream duh, water- no because it goes to waste.

i am cooking this soup as I write this so I have had a few tastes although it is not quite done yet.  I made some turkey broth yesterday so I used that instead of chicken broth and of course turkey in place of the chicken.  I used too much turkey for the amount of cabbage I used and I kept tinkering with it.  Kept adding turkey then more cabbage, then more broth and adjusted the pepper flakes and vinegar to my tastes but as of now it tastes pretty good.

Fantastic recipe!  I'm going to decrease the pepper flakes a tad, but that's personal preference. Also, I added the cabbage about 10 minutes before the chicken, and was glad I did. Thanks for posting this, we loved it.

This was fantastic! We didn't have fish sauce or lemon grass so we used more soy and a bit of our custom stir fry sauce instead. We also added reconstituted shittake mushrooms, green onions, carrots, celery and tofu (sans chicken).

WOW so good!  My go to soup when some one has a chest cold. here is a neat little FYI, those little red pepper packets from Pizza Hut or other pizza places are one teaspoon.Just perfect so you don't put too much and I always have a few in a kitchen drawer. Warning, This soup is HOT might not be best for children

We had a pot of cooked down chicken stock leftover and used it for this recipe.  We got some chinese cabbage on sale for the soup and it transformed into a delightful dish. Our whole family liked it, thanks!

My most successful attempt at hot sour soup.  It was the closest I’ve ever gotten to a restaurant style soup even though it didn’t have the mushrooms or tofu.  The cabbage made it work as a meal.  I substituted rice vinegar for balsamic and white pepper instead of black.

I  doubled the recipe. I didn't have lemongrass so I used 2 tablespoons of lemon zest and a handful of arugula to get that flavor.  I also added mushrooms and bamboo shoots. The spiciness was there but I added another 1/4 cup red wine vinegar to get the sour flavor that I was hoping for.  It came out fantastic.

I was looking for a chicken and cabbage soup recipe and found this.  The only thing I added was a bit of Szechwan sauce and ginger.  I replaced the lemongrass (that I couldn’t find at My local store) with chives. Also used a can of bean sprouts since they didn’t have fresh. We liked the soup and now I have lunch for a while!I may have put in a few too many red pepper flakes, but the internal heat is nice for this time of year!

Great! I used shrimp instead of chicken. I also needed to use up a bag of shredded cabbage so I used that instead and it was fine. Next time I’ll chop the onions smaller and maybe a little less of it, but this soup is a winner for sure. #soupstewchili #allrecipesallstarscanada

Made this for dinner, nearly as written, and it tasted really good, however, I did reduce the black pepper to 1 tsp. and it still had a strong black pepper taste.  We added some cider vinegar and a touch of sugar to tone it down.   I can't image how it would taste with the amount of black pepper as written.  Next time I will omit the black pepper to see what we think.  We added tofu and it was a good addition.  and also added mushrooms.  Would have added lemongrass but didn't have it.  Next time I will work harder to get it, because I love lemongrass, but it was fine without.   Great dish.

I omitted the lemongrass and subbed oyster sauce for the fish sauce. Hubby loved it and he judges any chinese restaurant by their hot and sour soup. I added 2 tbsp more vinegar because we like extra hot and sour.

This is a very versatile recipe, and turned out very tasty. I wish I could drop half a star because the cabbage was not tender enough at 10 minutes for my taste. Otherwise, the proportions are very good and are completely flexible to suit your own tastes. I didn't have/didn't use lemongrass, parsley, chicken, and I added sliced mushroom and a tablespoon of sugar, and I substituted homemade chili powder made from my garden peppers for the red pepper flakes. I substituted low sodium soy sauce because that's what I had, but I don't recommend that. It needed added salt with that change.

Like this very much.  I added a shrimp boullion cube as I had no fish sauce, also did not use lemon grass.  This broth was as good as some Chinese Restaurants, and that is the main reason we like hot and sour soup.  I will cook the cabbage a little longer next time before adding the chicken.  Will buy some fish sauce and try it with that next.  Also will add tofu and use less cabbage.

I tried this recipe and it tastes great...I didn't have any lemon grass so I added the juice and 1 tsp of zest of a lime and a lemon.  I ground a fresh tomato, and added that too.  I added 5 chopped bok Choy leaves and stems and 1/2 cup grated carrots and 1 cuo sliced fresh mushrooms, I added shrimp instead of chicken and it was delicious!!

My whole family loved this soup. I used extra chicken and some oyster sauce instead of fish sauce. They're requesting it again-a huge hit.

This was good...I added some grated carrots because I had them around and that gave it even more substance.  It is definitely spicy, which limits how much I eat in one sitting, so it makes a ton!
