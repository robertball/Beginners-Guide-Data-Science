For a flourless muffin, they were pretty good.  The texture was more like a cornmeal muffin, and I wished for more of a lemony flavor.  The brown color is from the almond flour and the coconut sugar.  The glaze adds some much-needed moisture, and I would like more lemon in the glaze, too.

I didn't care for this recipe. Followed recipe as it.  Too oily.  All of the blueberries dyed the bottom of the muffins blue, which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but the bottoms were just a mushy oily mess.

These are delish! I went hunting for a lemon muffin and this pulled up!! so glad that it did, it is a keeper!
I made these with flax eggs -bc I ran out of eggs- (Flax egg is 1 Tablespoon flax to 2.5 Tablespoons water- and let congeal for a few minutes.)  and kept the rest of the muffin to recipe. I would agree that you can decrease the coconut oil. However, even completing the recipe as is, my 3 children , neighbor and husband all wanted more. We ate the dozen that it made instantly and all saddened to realize these healthy muffins were gone. 
I did go with a slightly different glaze, just because, it was easier for me. I think I will be making some more tomorrow... or maybe tonight.  5 stars if decreased coconut oil.

I made these with butter instead of the coconut oil. I also added 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. The nutmeg, as well as the lemon flavor, was barely noticeable which was disappointing since I love both. I have found though, that when using almond or coconut flour, delicate flavors are often casualties and get lost. 
I did not use the drizzle, since I'm not a fan of coconut.
I used a standard sized ice cream scoop and the recipe only yielded 9 muffins, filled as directed.
If I were to make this recipe again, I'd still use butter and I'd try maybe doubling the lemon extract (and perhaps the nutmeg as well).

Not bad at all.  Makes WAY too much drizzle.  1/2 or even 1/4 of the amount would be plenty.

I liked these, but after reading reviews I did cut the oil in 1/2 and they turned out great texture wise.  I am not sure if my lemon extract went bad (if it even can) or if it's just a bad brand of it, but it tasted a lot like alcohol.  I'll make them again but either with a different brand or with just lemon juice.

Very nice flavor but it's very oily from all the coconut plus if you look at the nutritional information it's very very high in cholesterol and saturated fats which in itself isn't  very good for you. The serving size is more like snack size at this point. Would like to rework this recipe to make it healthier.

These were amazing! I added more blueberries but didn't change anything else. They don't even need the icing just a drizzle of honey will do.  Love it love it!!!!

this tastes good. I sweetened with 1/2 tsp stevia extract to make it lower carb and made a glaze with a couple Tbsp each butter and cream cheese and lemon juice sweetened with 1/2 tsp stevia. Only because I didn't have coconut butter. it was good but I probably won't make again because of all the fat.

Wow! Yummy! I made a few changes based on my pantry and on other reviewers' suggestions. I used 1/3 c butter instead of coconut oil and about 1/3 c brown sugar instead of coconut sugar. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and did not make the glaze, and I used frozen blueberries. They were still over-moist at the bottom, as others have said, so I lowered the temp, baked for another 10 minutes or so, carefully took them out, and put them back in the oven on a cooling rack to dry out a bit. Next time I will try adding some GF flour (or a little coconut flour) to help with that. The flavor is fantastic! I will definitely make them again!

Turned out perfect with one small adaptation.  Before adding the blueberries the mix seemed a bit too thin so I put in a tbl of ground flaxseed and let it sit for a couple of minutes.  Consistency was exactly what I wanted, mixed in the blueberries (they didn't sink), and baked.  I like the muffins plain, my husband liked a powdered sugar/lemon juice drizzle over the top.  Regardless - delicious!

We aren't paleo but do greatly restrict gluten and sugar so I thought I'd give these a try.  If you replace the coconut oil with butter, you do not need a 1/2 cup.  Maybe 1/3.  As the notes suggest, I did replace the coconut sugar with maple syrup and because many of our gluten free recipes in the past have tasted blah, I added 2 teaspoons of stevia.  I would add more next time.  The muffins are pretty dense and do closely resemble corn muffins in the texture.  Have not made the glaze yet but the muffins do not have a super strong lemon taste at all.

Good flavor but too much coconut oil. Next time I'll cut back by at least 2 tablespoons.
