I really loved the honey and mayonnaise spread. :) I sprinkled furikake over instead of dipping the salmon into it. I have about 4-5 different bottles (different flavors) of furikake, so I just chose one of them that I thougth would go best with the sweet topping. Furikake is a mix of spices, ground up dried fish, with nori (seaweed) and sesame seeds, and is normally sprinkled over rice. I'm more familiar with it "poke" style, which means cubed sushi-grade salmon mixed with furikake, soy sauce, mirin (or rice vinegar instead), etc...  But, also I think adding the furikake after searing is best. Frying salmon is definitely japanese. :) Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really tasty, I'll make this again.  I had some leftover homemade furikake that was definitely non-traditional, but it totally worked with the salmon, kewpie mayonnaise, and other ingredients.  The toasted seaweed, sesame seeds, bonito, spices, and other tasty bits of my furikake tasted great with the oily fish.  I might use prepared furikake if I run out of my own, but you can definitely make your own from ingredients you probably have in your pantry or that you can buy at the regular grocery store.

Ii really liked this a lot. it will go into the rotation.  I gave it a 4 not a 5  because  the salmon quantity was not specified and so the cooking time was wrong and so it thru the timing of my entire meal off... over cooked the  asparagus etc.   although that   can be remedied by simply adding more time  the enxt time I cook this... and there will be a next time.

Another thing. it didn't specify what kind of furikake to use. I just thru   the bits and dabs of my furikake bottles together. I am sure more people dont have 5 different flavors around like iIdo but.... if possible I would go with just a plain fumi or seaweed type. NOT a bonito or tomago style. I also did not use the wasabi type to make sure it didn't get too spicy for the kids..
with that being said, it  was awesome.. even the DH who has a distinctly American palate loved it...
I served it with saifun ( bean thread) with a light mirin, tamari, sesame, oil, sesame seed , ginger garlic  mixture.... nice and light with similar flavors but only having a hint of them to support the salmon not overpower it.

I also served sliced  salted cucumbers for the kids and that went very well.     

In summary, judge  the salmon timing based on your steaks.  this is a super yummy recipe. True taste of Hawai'i style Japanese.... Ono!
