Great combo of ingredients. I agree with the other reviewer that it needs more broth. I actually left my veggies a little chunky instead of completely blending them and I still ended up needing more liquid. I left both cans of beans undrained and added another cup of broth and that was perfect. I loved the flavor combo and I will make often.

My entire family LOVED this soup! I went with the other reviewers recommendations and doubled the chicken broth. I also doubled the ham. This is a very filling and comforting soup.

This soup was so simple and delicious! Hearty and comforting, it made a wonderful meal to warm us up this winter. It was a great way to use up leftover ham after the holidays. I find potato soups too "'heavy," so I liked how the recipe uses cauliflower to make it lighter with less carbs and more fiber and nutrients. The texture was perfect; thick and creamy, but I didn't mash the carrots with the potato and cauliflower and I didn't blend the second can of beans so that there would be more variety of texture, and it was great that way.
I doubled the recipe and brought it to a potluck, where everyone who tried it enjoyed it. The soup goes a long way, so I highly recommend it for social gatherings as well as for a home-cooked meal. I will definitely make this recipe again!
