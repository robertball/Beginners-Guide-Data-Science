I cut 4 peppers into quarters (yellow, red, orange) and placed them into the bottom of a 9 x 13 casserole dish that I had sprayed with Pam.  I added garlic, oregano and basil to the meat as it cooked as well as half of a yellow bell pepper rough chopped.  I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes but added a can of diced with oregano, garlic & olive oil.  I spread the mixture on top of the cut peppers and baked covered for 30 minutes.  I did add the reserved stuffing to the top at the end.  In the future I will use rice or orzo instead of the stuffing inside the meat mixture, we didn't like it that soggy.

I added taco seasoning to the meat to give it more flavor. I also baked it with cheese on top to hold it together and add flavor.

This was very bland.  I did add some cheese prior to baking, thank goodness, to add favor.  It was lacking a sauce to help hold the filling together.  I think a can of tomato soup or cream of mushroom soup would help but I probably will not make this again.

This dish was easy enough, but more flavorful with additions. Added garlic and did a cheese topping. Used cous cous instead of stuffing and it was just fine. Also, added a small can of tomato paste to bond ingredients together. A bit more stuffing for two peppers, so probably use 3 peppers.

A little bland, needed something more.  Will try with a cheese topping and maybe a sauce (more tomatoes soup?)

Instead of putting the filling in the pepper, I dice the peppers up and mix it in the mixture and place in a buttered casserole dish and heat and serve it as a side dish.....I add a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano and a little garlic. This is in place of the can of whole tomatoes..
