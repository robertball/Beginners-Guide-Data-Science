Light and lemony with all the taste of creamy cheesecake and without all the fuss! This is a quick and easy dessert that tastes like you spent hours. I topped these with a sugared raspberry, lemon zest and a little whipped cream. I can't wait to try these again!

The filling is delicious, but the crust was hard and not very flavourful I think I will try it with graham crackers or gingersnaps next time. I had to bake this 30 minutes in my oven for it to be set. Thanks!

I made these as a "something different" dessert for our Easter holiday feast.  They turned out great!  The crust turned out well for me baked for 8 minutes.  I used Splenda instead of sugar for the filling, otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Delicious.  I'll make these again.

I have been looking for a sweet with low points since I am doing weight watchers and this one is perfect. I used splenda instead of the 1 cup of sugar. The taste is amazing and I am able to eat a square at only 3 points! Thank you!

I made these the other day and oh my goodness! We couldn't stop eating them! Though I did make the crust with graham cracker since I don't like nilla wafers. They were so good, even though they were a little undercooked. I'm making them again tomorrow  =]

Every single time I make these squares I make people mad. Why? Because they're absolutely ADDICTIVE! I always make a double batch because they're just a crowd pleaser. My friends call them Crack Squares because your hooked after the first bite. If you do make them in double batches you will need to extend the cooking time if you use a conventional oven like I do. Typically I add 10 mins when I bake 2 pans of the crust and it can take up to an additional 30 mins when baking 2 pans of all the ingredients... needless to say they're well worth the wait.

Perfect just as they are in the recipe. I did make a graham cracker crust to save on time. Will definitely make them again.

Since we have a lemon tree in our back yard, I have been looking for recipes to use the lemons in.  I used a graham cracker crust and made them in a 13x9" pan.  I also doubled the filling per other reviews.  I have to say, this is one of the best lemon bar recipes I have made.  My family, including our grandchildren, loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were perfect! I got so many compliments and people saying they could never get lemon bars from scratch quite right... For my first lemon bar recipe I am exceptionally pleased! I will be making these again and again.

Modification: I baked in the toaster oven on the lowest shelf and it took 1 hr 5 min to bake in the 8x8 pan. I took it out when the center was only slightly jiggly, not droopy, when I tilted the pan.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe fairly closely except I put all of the zest into the mixture, instead of on top. Was the hit of the party.

Good flavor but made as directed the vanilla wafer bottom is dry as toast. I also found the top to be very dry if cooked long enough to be set.  I doubt I try this one again.

My 3 kids and I LOVE this!! My teenage son prefers this over any other dessert I make. I follow the recipe exactly and love the nilla wafer crust. It's got just enough sweetness.

this was easy and came out perfect. next time i might double the zest to 2 tbsp at the least. keep in mind that following the recipe will give you a light dessert, if you want more pow just add from there.
also, the wafers took forever to crush properly. next time i might try it with shortbread - or graham crumbs.
