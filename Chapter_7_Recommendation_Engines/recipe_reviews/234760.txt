Using the blender to chop the ingredients is brilliant.  I followed the recipe very closely, only having 2 deviations:  I added 1 tsp. sea salt, and I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, instead of the more expensive tenderloins.  First of all, I think the recipe has promise, but overall, the mix is just too wet, and the carrot taste is much too prominent.  Back down some on the carrots, even add some fresh parsley and some red pepper flakes, and cut the eggs down to 2.  The loaf had a good aroma while cooking, but the finished product was a bit tame, for me.

This meatloaf is not only tasty, but its pretty in color.  I took advice from a couple other people here, and used less carrots.  I'm glad I did, because two fresh organic carrots were plenty for this recipe.  I'm not sure if the originator of this recipe used baby carrots or not, for why this recipe called for so many carrots.

Followed the recipe but added 6 garlic cloves since my wife loves garlic.  Needs something to spice it up a bit more.  We will make this again for sure but next time we'll add a jalapeno and 1/2 more tablespoon italian seasoning. Maybe some cheese  well?

I made this for my dtr & son-in-law. They loved it! I only used about 6 baby carrots & it still seemed like a lot of carrots. I used chicken that had alredy been cooked. Worried that it might be bland but they thought it was perfect.

I made this for my parents and their review of it was that it was just basic, not good, not bad. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to it, but if I make it again I'll probably be adding a few more spices.

This recipe is ingenious.  I switch things up a bit though because we like a kick to our meals. Instead of chicken I combined hot Italian sausage with ground beef.  I also make the vegetable mix in my food processor.  I drain it and save the juices for the sauce I put on top. I also throw in a couple Roma tomato’s.  This gives a fresh taste to the meal. I have made this recipe three times in the last 6 months. I had to double it the last two times because my family loves it so much and they love it as a leftover. I usually serve it with sautéed green beans.

I made no changes to this recipe and my wife and I loved it! So delicious, we were impressed.  This will definitely be added to our standard stock of dinners.  Cook and cool time is lengthy and so needs to be started early; however, prep time is not much time at all for such a wonderful meal.  Naturally, like all types of meatloaf, the opportunity to improvise is available, I expect us to experiment with that as well!   High in fiber, so those not used to this should take notice, I loved it.  As a main course, some other carb source is definitely needed on the side.
