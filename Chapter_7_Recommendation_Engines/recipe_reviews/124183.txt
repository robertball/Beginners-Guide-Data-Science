Great recipe!! I did everything exactly as is but at the cornmeal as I didn't have any and it turned out delicious! I did it with the skin on this time around, but next time i'll prepare it with the skin off since most of the yummy crunchiness stuck on the skin. Chicken came out moist and flavorful.

So simple, yet so satisfying. This is definitely my favorite recipe for bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, so I omitted the Italian seasoning. I never have cornmeal in the house, so I omitted that, too. I loved it with ranch, but it's great made with honey mustard, too. I bake it on a cooling rack over a pan, so the bottoms donâ€™t get soggy.

I used 4 thighs and 4 split breasts - all skinned. Doubled all ingredients and added a tsp of cayenne and another of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning. I'm giving four stars because it was good, and VERY easy. The kids loved it!

This was soooo easy to make. It was pretty tasty too. I used a buttermilk ranch and I think it was a little too creamy for a recipe like this. It kind of loses its flavor as it bakes. I'll try a tangier tasting ranch like Hidden Valley next time and see if it gives it more flavor. UPDATE: I tried making this using Cesar dressing. It turned out WAY better! Try it!

I've made a similar dish that was much better using mayonaise instead of ranch & just coating with seasoned bread crumbs I'd added some parmesan & white pepper to.  I threw it in the rotisserie for 30 minues & voila!  With the ranch it was a bit lacking, try it with mayo.

This is a favorite. I make it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I bake them for 10 minutes on each side.

I loved this recipe .It was easy & tasty I made a twist to it though I marinated the chicken overnight in a marinade of yogurt, lemon juice, dash of vinegar, salt, pepper , oregano & minced onion then I took the chicken out of the marinade into the bread crumbs mixture & into the oven .The chicken were very tender & juicy & yummy .The whole family can't wait to do it again

My kids loved this recipe (kids are easy to please!  well, in my house anyway!), but as an adult, I have to say, this is a gloppy mess.  While the top of chicken was crispy-ish, the bottom was soggy and swimming in its own juices.  Even with the addition of more spices--garlic, oregano, fresh basil, cayenne, sea salt and ground pepper, this is just not a recipe worth repeating.

My husband said delicious and my 2 year old who doesn't usually eat much meat ate a whole piece.  It is a basic recipe idea but turned out great.  I put mine on a baking rack but the bottom was still a little soggy.  I think I'll try baking at the higher temp next time since I just did 350 to go with other things in the oven.

An easy to prepare chicken dish that has a mild delicious flavor and is very moist.  I dipped the chicken in the ranch dressing about an hour ahead of baking but wish I had done it sooner to marinate it in the dressing for more of that flavor.

I used mayo instead of ranch dressing as another review suggested.  Was disappointed -- rather bland.  Baked it on a rack so the bottom didn't get soggy.  Will make this again using the ranch dressing called for plus an extra tsp. of Italian Seasoning.  My family enjoyed the consistency of the coating.

I improvised on this recipe as I didn't have bread crumbs.  I crumbled ritz crackers and mixed it with the parmesan then sprinkled some oregano on top when I put them in the oven.  It was good but pretty messy dipping the thighs into the ranch dressing and then the crumb mixture, probably easier if you just put the crumb mix in a bowl rather than bag.  Hubby thought it was great and he's not a big fan of chicken so it was a success

This recipe was fabulous!! I had to substitute Panko for the bread crumbs as I didn't have any.  I added baby red potatoes coated in a little olive oil right to the baking pan with the chicken.  Added ground pepper and salt, and sprinkled parmesan on top.  Fabulous! My boyfriend and I LOVED it!!!!

This chicken turned out very moist and crisp on top.The bottom was a little soggy,maybe should use a wire rack to bake on.I thought it was lacking flavor. I would definitely use more spices in the bread crumbs and add garlic for sure. I used 6 thighs and they were pretty big, so  had to bake for 60 min. I would make this again but with a lot more spices.

"Delicious" and "more please" were the comments from my 3yo and 9yo and my hubby loved it too. So I will definitely be making this again. I used low fat mayo (all I had) and a little olive oil as the "dressing" and no cornmeal, and it was wonderful. Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good but no better/different than other breaded chicken recipes I have used.  I don't think the ranch did anything for the chicken but my husband really liked it so I gave it 4 instead of 3.  I baked it on a wire rack and turned the chicken pieces every 10 mins to avoid the sogginess.  I left out the italian seasoning as we don't care for it with chicken and subtituted montreal steak spice.

This is one of the most delicious and easiest meals to make! My family loves it! I added a dash of sugar to the batter and it adds a hint of sweet to the chicken.

I followed these directions, except used mayo as another user had suggested. I also cooked these on a rack so they did not sit in its own juices as other members had suggested. My grown son loved them. But as an advanced cook, I found them juicy yet somewhat plain and under seasoned. I used hot sauce on the side to enhance the taste. Will not make them again.

So tender and juicy, cooked perfectly the first time. I didn't have cornmeal so I used a handful of mashed potato flakes. Not sure I missed the cornmeal at all.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My family enjoyed the flavor of this dish but didn't like that the chicken was on the bone. I will make this again using boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead.

Yum!  We just finished eating this and my 2 year old loved it!  I made it according to the directions, but also added some garlic powder.  It had some good flavor, but nothing overwhelming.

I also didn't have ranch dressing so I used blue cheese and it was delicious!! I did add paprika to the bread crumbs, and skipped the cornmeal.  I have used this recipe with thighs and cutlets as well!! super easy and yummy!!

I make a recipe very like this and will combine the best of the two.  I prepare gluten free recipes so I use gluten free replacements in all recipes,i., breadcrumbs are homemade from G.F. bread, etc.  I use yoghurt to coat the chicken and add my own spice mixture.  Dijon mustard is good 'smeared' on the chicken also.  This is one of those great recipes that has many possible variations.  Thank you.

My family loved these!  If you are afraid to try it thinking you don't like Ranch, try it!  You can't taste the ranch.  Very good and moist chicken.

If you like fried chicken you will love this dish! I made it for the first time and absolutely loved it. I used cayenne pepper and added more Parmesan Cheese. 
It is really easy and tasty. It will be apart of our household dish!

I used crushed stove top stuffing instead of bread crumbs. Needless to say, pretty flavourful! These were a hit with my lunch crowd.

Honestly didnt really like it to much.. the chicken was moist, but it was too soggy even after putting it on a wire rack to drain excess juice!! But that is only my opinion you did a great job with the ingredients!!

I only gave this 4 stars because I modified it a lot to make it low cal. I made 4 skinless boneless chicken thighs and total it was only 1180 calories for the entire dish. 
I used 
1/2 cup Italian Bread Crumbs
1/4 cup Reduced Fat Parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp cornmeal
1/4 cup Fat Free Mayo
3 Tbsp of Italian seasoning (I wasn't sure using the mayo how much flavor it would have)

Mix all dry ingredients in a large zip lock bag. 
I rolled the chicken in the mayo and then rolled it in the dry ingredients.
I then placed the chicken on a cooling rack on top of a sheet pan. Someone in the reviews mentioned doing this to keep it all crisp. FANTASTIC IDEA!!!

I cooked it for about 45 minutes and it was juicy and amazing. My 5 year old ate a ton and my husband asked why I didn't make more :)

Add something to "zing" it up.  Perhaps a little bit of cayenne, as someone else suggested.  At the very least a bit of black pepper.  Aside from that, the chicken cooked up beautifully.  I baked on a rack, over a jelly roll pan, for about 40 minutes.  Extremely moist.  The ranch dressing is brilliant.

Easy, tasted great, crispy on the outside (a little soggy on the bottom, but not bad) and moist inside. We used Fat Free Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and Herbs de Provence for seasoning.

Very easy!  Added about 2 tsp dried pesto seasoning to the breading.  I used buttermilk ranch and it was perfect.  Leftovers were tasty too.  Will definitely make this again and play with breading ingredients.  Update (5/2014):  Add some hot sauce to the ranch.  Just a few drops of green Tabasco was perfect!

I didn't have Italian Seasoning so I added some of my own:  garlic powder, parsley, oregano, basil and pepper.  I had to use a lot more than 1/2 cup of the ranch dressing.  Next time, I think I will add a little cayenne as well.  Very good.

This was a pretty good dish... I used thighs, but think I'll do it with boneless breasts next time. The chicken had a great flavor and was very moist. My only complaint is that the breading didn't stay on the chicken very well, which very well could have been something I did wrong. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was super yummy! I had to change a few things because I didn't have the exact recipe in the cupboard...I used ceasar dressing, instead of ranch..and parmasan bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs mixed with parmasan. It was moist, and delicious!
