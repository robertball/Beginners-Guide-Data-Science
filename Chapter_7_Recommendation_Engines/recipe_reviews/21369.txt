I enjoyed this much more than the casseroles that have cream soup in them.  I added a little extra salt and real bacon bits and it was great! Next time I'm going to add a little sour cream, too.

Company worthy!  Used what I had on had which was mozzarella cheese and  refrigerated shredded hash browns instead of frozen.  Kept everything else the same and we loved it.  Thanks Robbie....great side dish!

very good, I liked this because it was not soooo rich like other similar casseroles that can be so cheesy. Will make this again for sure! By the way, you could even make this spicier by throwing in assorted herbs. Thanks!

This recipe is a great breakfast recipe. It is quick & easy & very tasty. I did not do the microwave thing (There was NO WAY my dish was fitting into my microwave). I just mixed the cheese up real good with the hash browns & minced garlic (using my hands). I added a dash of cayenne and a LOT of cracked black pepper. I baked it for 25 minutes & then topped it with more cheese & baked it for 5 more minutes. It came out really tasty.

This was fine; however, the bottom portion was soggy as the milk and stock did not all get absorbed (perhaps baking it longer would have helped, though I followed the suggested baking time).  The top portion was good - cheesy and crunchy.  Another problem may be the definition of hashbrowns...I used what some people call home fries, small sort of diced potatoes, sold frozen in bags...

This is a great recipe - but I used mozzarella cheese and added cooked diced ham to make it a main dish meal.

I didn't really like this.  My biggest problem was the instructions.  The microwaving part was confusing.  The house got too hot and it seemed like it took alot longer to cook than the recipe said.  There was alot leftover at the end of the week when I went to clean out the fridge.

This one quickly became a favorite cheesy potato dish in our house. Love that it is broth based and can be tweaked to reduce fat...

Made for pot luck, many compliments. I did make it in a crock pot, added garlic and other seasonings as others suggested, and a can of undiluted french onion soup for the beef broth.  Will definitely make again, loved that it didn't have cream of anything soup in it.

I took this a bit further and added diced green chilis and some chili powder along with chicken broth instead of the beef and it was great!!

This was pretty good, and like others said, not heavy like others.  It was not a big hit with my hubby or kids and they haven't asked for it again but I liked it.  I would make it again.

This is awesome!  I added leftover cubed ham to this.  I have a VERY picky eater who hates trying anything new, and if he does, he spits it out.  He LOVED this recipe.

Great recipe!  I added 12 precooked (then cut up) turkey sausage patties to make it a meal.  I used plain rice milk and Daiya Cheddar Cheese to make it dairy free.  Lastly, I skipped the whole microwave process and simply baked it for 20 minutes, stirred it, baked it 15 more minutes.  The whole family has declared it a winner so I know I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a gluten free hash brown casserole and stumbled across this one.  Instead of broth I used a few tablespoons of sour cream and instead of garlic powder, minced garlic, cooked for about 50 minutes at 350.  Pretty good :)  Oh, and stirred it all up after adding the milk mixture.

There was too much liquid, and it was rather bland. I think it could be tweaked to be better (less liquid, some fresh herbs), but as written, it's just okay. On the plus side, it wasn't made with a canned "cream of" soup.

I was so glad to find a recipe without any processed cream product. It was really good. I used cheddar instead of colby.

A big hit.  Used 1 cup beef broth with a splash of milk.  Used cooking spray on bottom of pan and about 1 cup of cheese mixed with potatoes.  Baked at 425 for 30 minutes and then broiled for 5, with a little more cheese added to the top.  Also used onion powder rather than minced onion.

Very good!  I thought some people might want to hear a couple of modifications that made it even easier.  I divided the recipe in half to serve our family of 4.  In step 2 I mixed 1/2 bag of hash browns, 1 c cheese, and seasoned salt to taste (because I didn't feel like cutting onions!).  In step 3 I dabbed some butter on top of the potatoes and poured a can of evaporated milk over it (because I had some to use up, and I was also out of broth.) Completed steps 4 & 5 as directed.  Yum!
