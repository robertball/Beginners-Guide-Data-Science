I used extra almond milk, due to very thick batter. I also added a little bit of peanut butter powder to make 'Peanut Butter and Jelly' pancakes. ( the 'Jelly' is a 14oz or so bag of mixed frozen berries simmered with 2 tbsp real maple syrup. I simmer the entire time I prep and cook pancakes. I Blend in a blender and use just like syrup can add a bit of water or more maple syrup to taste, and for thinness of syrup) 
This is the first time I made flax seed and almond milk pancakes, they were devoured by my guys. Tomorrow I'm going to attempt to adapt the recipe for 'pineapple upside down pancakes'

Overall these were OK. I was debating between a 3 and a 4. Since my toddler ate every bite I went with the 4. I made one change and that was to use ground flax instead of flax seeds. The taste of these was fine but the pancakes were heavy and slightly gummy tasting. Maybe the ground flax caused this. If I were to make soymilk pancakes again I would just use my favorite recipe and substitute the milk. Thank you for the recipe idea; we enjoyed trying it for breakfast.

We enjoyed these pancakes. I too used ground flax instead of the seeds. The consistency was a little off but the flavor was really good. I will make them again when I get flax seeds to see if that was the issue with the consistency.

I made this today and it was pretty good. The only thing I would change is using wheat flour instead of regular. I also used almond milk instead of soy but next time I will use 2 cups we like our pancakes really thin. I cooked the pancakes in coconut oil also. I will definitely make this again with the modifications I mentioned.
