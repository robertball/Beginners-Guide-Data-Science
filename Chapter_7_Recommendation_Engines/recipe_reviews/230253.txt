This pie was actually one of the first holiday pies I ever made when my husband and I first set up house. I can't remember if I saw it on the back of the marshmallow bag or the graham cracker box. When I made this, I actually pressed the pie crust ingredients into a pie dish and baked it for 8 minutes. The directions are very simple to follow and it made a fabulous fluffy chocolate-marshmallow pie. VERY much like S'Mores. We inhaled this pie.

It was a good type of cream pie.  I wasn't ecstatic about it but glad I was able to use our leftover s'mores from our camping trip.  Next time,  I will use cool whip instead of making whipped cream and throw it in the freezer.
