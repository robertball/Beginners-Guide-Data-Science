Amy, your review is dated a couple of years back, but the rating is not correct. In fact the recipe was wonderful if you have patience. My grandmother years ago gave me the recipe (she made the best ever), I have unfortunately misplaced it (ok lost it), I knew the ingredients, but not sure of the amounts to use. I used this recipe.  They were almost like Grandmaâ€™s.
 A little hint to the next person who tries these for the 1st time. Make sure your iron is hot before you place it in the batter, however it cannot be to hot (yes some trials and errors will occur) if it starts to fry the batter in your dish your iron is too hot. Make sure you do not get the batter on top of the iron (that is very important), I also find that if you tap the iron a couple of time once the batter starts to fry you can knock off the rosette off of the iron , then can use tongs to pick them up and put them on the paper towel.
So as far as the recipe goes, it is a very good one.

I am so happy to be able to come back and update my review. I tried this recipe years ago and had disastrous results. It's taken me this long to work up the nerve to try again. Before preparing these, I studied up on how to make them like a student preparing for a final. I used an electric skillet to be sure the oil was the right temp, and heated the iron up with the pan. As soon as I dipped the iron, I shook it up and down (not side to side) and this released the perfectly formed cookie into the oil. 
Your oil cannot be too hot, or too cold. Your iron needs to be hot, make sure to keep it in the oil for a bit, mine always sizzled when I dipped it into the batter again. Be sure to coat only the bottom and sides of the iron, not the top. And be patient, this takes awhile. I am soo happy to have made rosettes, now I know that I can bake ANYTHING!

This is a very good recipe.
I omitted the butter and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. You can add the flavoring of your choice including anise,cinnamon or what suits you.
Remember,like another reviewer said,make sure your iron is hot-but not too hot and most of all have patience.
Also try making and refrigerating the batter a few hours before you intend to use it so the bubbles can escape.
Last note-I get 30 from this recipe.

Hi, Amy.  I'm a new member of this site.  In case you are still looking for a rosette iron, I want to mention that you can find them at Sur la Table cooking store in Chicago or online at surlatable.com.  This recipe is great!  John

My mom made these every Christmas. I always thought they would be too difficult to try. This recipe is so easy and renders a successful outcome! I must make a second batch for Christmas Day!
