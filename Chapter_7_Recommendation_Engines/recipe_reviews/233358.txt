I made these for Thanksgiving breakfast to hold us over until the big feast.  Everyone loved them!  I added chocolate chips to some of them and pecans to top off others - they were great all around.

Love this recipe.  Very easy. I used a spice cake mix instead of yellow cake mix.  Also have used in loaf pan for pumpkin bread.

I thought these were really good. They weren't overly sweet which is a good thing sometimes. I had a yellow cake mix & pumpkin pur√©e that I wanted to use & this did the trick! My husband isn't a fan of desserts that are too sweet so he loved them. :) thanks for sharing the recipe!

Easy to make & I liked it, but it definitely needs frosting (I made cream cheese). I added cinnamon but it still lacked the pumpkin punch that I love; I should have heated the pumpkin first. A touch more spice might be in order as well.

So easy, so good! Made it as a bundt cake instead. After reading the other reviews, I added an extra half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, replaced the oil with melted butter, and the water with milk. It was delish!

EXCELLENT recipe ! I used half and half cream instead of water, and cooked them only 18 minutes.  They were such a hit with the family, that I had to make a second batch, the same day.

I made this recipe yesterday for a small gathering. 
It RULED. Easy to make, easy to hand-mix, very little prep mess.
My friends descended upon the piping hot, tender/moist cupcakes about 5 minutes after they were baked. 
Delicious, pumpkin-tastic and not overly-sweet. 
This recipe also halves down very well (I separated the white from the second egg and used another whole egg). I baked these for approx. 25 minutes, and they were great!
I'm probably going to develop a baking problem because of this recipe.
