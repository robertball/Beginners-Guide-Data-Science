Very heavy on the chocolate.  If I make this pie again,I would cut the chocolate in half.  Plus I would also mix the malted powder in with the pudding initially to help make it blend in smoother.

Silky smooth and creamy! Very good! I added malted milk into pudding before cooking and it wasn't grainy or lumpy, however, there wasn't enough malted milk for my taste so I think I will increase amount to 1/2 cup next time. I cut the chocolate back to 2 squares and it was plenty! I plan on making this for the holidays.

My son made this pie as part of our Thanksgiving meal.  We used two squares of bittersweet chocolate rather than four.  Also, we chopped our malted milk balls with a food processor and sprinkled them on top.  It was delicious!

Fantastic pudding!  I only made the pudding, not the whole pie.  I used 3 oz of chocolate and 1/2 cup malt powder (added the powder to the pudding before cooking) and substituted half & half for 1/2 of the milk and it was the best, silkiest pudding I've ever had and others told me it was the best they ever had. However, even with 1/2 cup of malt, not real malty.  Next time I'd use the 4 oz of chocolate like the recipe says.
