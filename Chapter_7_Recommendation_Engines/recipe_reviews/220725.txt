This is a perfectly simple method to prepare asparagus.  You can never go wrong w/butter and the onions add a nice touch.  We paired these with grilled delmonico steaks and it was a marriage made in heaven.  I really like that these are pan fried as opposed to my go to roasting method for when the oven is otherwise occupied.  THANKS for the recipe, Laurie Brenner!

Awesome:) I subbed EVOO for the butter and sea salt for the onion (didn't have any). Simple and delicious, thanks for the recipe:)

Five star for a very good quick and easy basic recipe! I wasn't in the mood for the butter flavor so used extra virgin olive oil instead. Also, used a sweet red onion because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great because the sweeter flavor was divine! Didn't use any seasoning because decided ahead of time to serve garnished with fresh finely shredded parmesan and sliced (julienne style) pre-cooked pancetta instead.

This quick and easy recipe earned me RAVE reviews! I used 1 tbsp. of olive oil instead of the second tbsp. of butter because of the high heat, and accidentally let the asparagus and onions go longer than I intended while I was working on something else. It turned out to be a happy accident, though, because we ended up with a delicious caramelization effect that I will try to duplicate on purpose next time.

I have never tried this with onion salt, but I won't eat asparagus any other way than pan fried in butter. It is soo yummy. I like to leave it tender crisp, or I like to cook  it until the ends are darkened. Both ways are delicious. I sprinkle mine with sesame seeds when I serve, as it adds just a little something extra. My kids love the sesame seeds on there too.

We absolutely loved this simple recipe.   The only change I made was that I doubled the onions.   I will definitely make this dish many times.

I really didn't care much for this technique of making asparagus. I normally broil or grill them. I found the asparagus to be too greasy and not much flavor was imparted by the onion or seasoning, oddly. It also took a little longer than suggested. Will stick to other asparagus recipes on the site I have found more flavorful. It went fine with dinner this evening though.

The result is similar to what you would expect if you roasted the asparagus. Very easy and tasty

This is a far superior method of preparing asparagus than boiling or steaming in my view.  I cut the spears in two inch lengths, used shallots rather than onions, added fresh minced garlic and omitted the onion salt.  Very easy to control the degree of crispness/tenderness you prefer.

Delicious. Easy. One pan only. I subbed ghee, (clarified butter) to make it GAPS friendly, (GAPSdiet.com). I put regular kosher salt instead of onion salt. It all came out lovely-like.

The onions were good, but they did not complement the asparagus very well, and the seasonings didnâ€™t either. There are some much better ways to prepare asparagus, so this, while not terrible, was kind of a waste of good asparagus.

This was good! The only changes I made was  to cook the onion with the asparagus the whole time and I added minced garlic.  The whole family enjoyed it.

I tried this recipe and it was good.   However, it was nothing special.  My version of just olive oil and garlic powder either pan fried or roasted surpassed the flavor of this recipe by far.

I'm normally not an asparagus person - but wow, this was wonderful.  Very flavorful - I love the onions added.  Didn't change a thing - maybe a little less butter than called for in recipe - but will be making this often.

This is a quick and easy way to prepare fresh asparagus. It helps to have a transparent lid so this asparagus doesn't overcook.

Im always looking for a way to jazz up veggies, this was great!  Very easy, tons of flavor.  It goes with ANY meal, I swear (chicken, beef, fish, even rice if you are going vegetarian).
