This recipe is fantastic!!  Its so easy to pull together.  It never fails me.  Always comes out perfect. I've even modified it a bit by using fat free or low fat cream cheese or fat free sweetened condensed milk. I found that in my electric oven I've had to bake it for 3-5 minutes longer. 
I let the cake sit for a couple of hours before refrigerating and I've never had problems with cracking.  I've also skipped the crust by spraying the spring form pan with Pam and then sprinkling graham cracker crumbs on the bottom and sides.  
Thanks for a great recipe--and my husband thanks you as well!! :)

I've made this cake quite a few times now and I LOVE IT !!!!! It's easy to adjust to make different cheese cakes...like adding white chocolate chips after mixing the batter or peanut butter or melting down a hazelnut chocolate bar instead of the semisweet chocolate...though I find that I like it made with dark chocolate for the cake mix and milk chocolate for the topping. You really can add just about anything to this cake and it just gets better and better.

when this came out of the oven it looked kinda weird, but i stuck it in the fridge overnight and it turned out wonderful. Creamy and rich. I used fat free cream cheese, semi-sweet chocolate chips and 6 oz of chocolate and orange wafers (cuz we ate the other three :O). I didn't have a pie pan so i used a small casserole dish. It is addicting and filling...i am glad i tried this one.

This was fabulous.  I used oreo cookies for the crust and put a little bit of coco powder (maybe a table spoon) in the batter to give it an extra punch.  Make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature!  I mixed mine in a food processor (less air) to make a very dense cheese cake...just the way I like it.  I also left it in the oven (with the oven turned off) for one hour after baking.  I decorated the top with dark chocolate dipped strawberries and white chocolate curls.  Everyone at the office loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving & everyone really liked it- it wasn't as good as I expected, but I still liked it. I made a raspberry sauce by pureeing a bag of frozen raspberries & sugar & that made it even better! This is a great "basic" recipe- there are so many things you can do to dress it up.
