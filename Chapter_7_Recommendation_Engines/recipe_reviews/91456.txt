Nice! I changed this recipe as follows to serve four: just under ¼ cup Old Bay (instead of the salt and crab boil); 1 lb cooked/frozen jumbo shrimp. Other changes: I cooked the corn in advance, in another pot; I cut the potatoes into quarters. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. I had no idea what to expect with so few ingredients – the results were amazing. I had my parents over for dinner & we all LOVED IT. In a nod to tradition, I used newspaper as a tablecloth (but we ate out of bowls and I ate with my fingers). A fun evening!

I love this recipe. I make this all the time, the only thing I do is add crab legs to it. I call it a crab boil. I am always making this for girls nite. I like to serve this with a garlic dipping butter and hot sauce.

this is our favorite summer fire pit meal. we cook it on our fire pit in the backyard. we add in some crab legs and andoulle sausage. it's a big hit with our neighbors and friends.we put 3 onions quartered and 5 garlic cloves and course ground pepper. it's fun to sit outside and cook it with some cold brews. that's how we do it in milwaukee, wi.

This is an exciting dish to make and eat. The shrimp is enhanced by the garlic and sweetness of the corn.   Try it. I know you'll love it!

This was not terrible, but it wasn't great for sure.  The lemon made the whole thing taste funny.  I doubt I'll make this again.

We made this for forty people and it was a huge hit.  Just be aware that some people have shell fish allergies and may need alternate meal.  I did use Old Bay Seasoning and fresh from the field sweet corn.  I worried about the lemons but they were fine.  We may do this annually.  It was superb!

The whole family loved it! There was NOTHING left. I didn't change a thing but will have to put in some extra corn next time for the kids.

This is phenomenal!  Yes this is really basic but everything comes together and tastes like you spent all day slaving away.  Think of it more as a Southern verison of a clambake rather than a traditional "stew".  

Fixed two big pots of this for 4th of July over my grill.  Briefly grilled the corn before adding it to the pot.  Everyone loved it though be warned it's a bit messy to eat.

the kids and the neighbors love this dish.  I've also added cajun seasoning, whole mushrooms, and pearl onions.  I've also sliced some green, red, and orange peppers for color and flavor.  I'm always looking for more ways to give it a little something extra.

5 stars for how easy this is to prepare.  3 for the lemon that I didn't like and the seasoning.  Maybe I'm not being fair because it could be the brand of seasoning I used, but this was so hot my husband wouldn't eat anymore of it until I rinsed it and boiled it a little more in fresh water.  I had fresh shrimp from the Gulf and should have made Jambalya like I had planned.

If you can find fresh in the shell clams, use them!  The clams need to go in with the corn at a simmer and we used jumbo shrimp so it sat 7 minutes vs. 5.  We use only Old Bay on the Outer Banks or J.O spice.  We precut everything except the potatoes and we use 2.5 quarts of seawater.  DO NOT ADD SALT to this and the seawater should come to a boil first then add and simmer from there.  Andouille is the best sausage out of the casing.  The best you will ever taste!  You can substitute mussels for clams too!  If you have no seawater use 1.5 tablespoons of Kosher Salt to the water.

Added 18 middlemen clams and a turkey kielbasa to recipe.  Substituted old bay, 2 bay leafs, black pepper, and pickling spices for crab boil as I can’t that in my local stores.  Substituted little potatoes for medium potatoes.  Used 5 cloves garlic.  Boiled the onion lemon and spices first, then added little potatoes and clams for 5 minutes at high boil; then corn for 5 minutes more; check clams and if opened, then turned off heat and add shrimp (peeled with tails on) and turkey kielbasa cut into 1 inch pieces for 5 minutes more until shrimp pink

I`ve made this pot of goodness many times now....., my whole family just loves it, and it`s fun to eat! I add Old Bay for extra flavor though. I`ll be making this again tonight using lobster tails that`s on sale to add to the pot :)
