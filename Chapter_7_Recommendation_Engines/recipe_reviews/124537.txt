Great bread!! Made the dough in my bread machine.  I doubled the caraway seeds, (I like them), added 1 Tbsp vital wheat gluten as I wanted a softer less dense bread, brushed the top with egg and sprinkled with more caraway seeds.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Millie Feather- Bread genius! This was way better than I thought it would be. I doubled the caraway, but that was the only change. I baked half in a bread loaf pan and one in a round loaf, they did not rise very much when baking. However, this was probably my fault. After reading other reviews, I probably should have let the bread rise longer than an hour. You need to stop reading this and go bake some of this bread right now. AWESOME!! Making patty melts with what is LEFT...already ate most of it right away....

This bread is delicious! I was out of brown sugar... I wish I had molasses to sub, but honey had to do... still, it's very moist. I baked it in bread pans. Will make again - so far my favorite rye bread recipe on this site. And next time I will use molasses instead of brown sugar.

My husband and I both liked this one.  The only change I would make in the future is adding extra caraway seed.  Very moist.  Hubby wants it in a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.

Having read the reviews, I made one change with the caraway seeds.  I added 1 TBSP of finely ground caraway seeds (used a coffee grinder) and also added 1/2 TBSP of whole caraway seeds to the dough.  Then I sprinkled a a teaspoon or so on top.  Delicious!

This is the first rye bread I've baked and am I happy I chose this recipe. It was very easy to make and the result is fantastic: very light and subtly flavorful.  I started the kneading process with all of the rye flour and only two cups of all purpose flour and slowly added the additional 3/4 cups as the dough became too sticky to knead.  It worked beautifully with a total kneading time of five minutes. Only change I made was doubling the amount of caraway seeds.  Thanks, Millie, for a great recipe which will become a regular in my kitchen.

I created this dough with my breadmaker. I put the wet ingredients on the bottom and topped with sugar, salt, the flours and topped with the caraway seeds and yeast. I selected the dough cycle and saw that it was a little too wet so I added 1/4 cup of all purpose flour and a couple of hours later had heavenly dough. The bread was absolutely perfection! Thank you so much for this recipe. I reviewed it on my blog.

This is why I learned to make bread.  Dense, flavorful with a chewy crust this is bakery quality bread.  The only thing I changed was to add more caraway seed.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

This was the first bread I ever made and it came out great.  Though I didn't have any round baking pans, I just put the dough into some metal bowls and.. ta da!  Tasted so good and made my house smell awesome - good bread!

wow!  This recipe turned out great.  I used the whole recipe to make 1 big loaf - living in high altitude I needed to add a little extra flour and it baked for about 5 min longer.  I tried another recipe for rye bread from this site that didn't turn out at all!  Thanks so much!  I will be using this often!

i wish i wouldn't have waited so long to make this bread...it is a great recipe...i did use the bread machine to bake it as well and was impressed with the results...nice and lite and tasty...but next time i will just do the dough thingy and shape like a rye loaf and bake in the oven...i had to use dark rye flour coz that is what i had and did add vital wheat gluten as well (i do that with all my breads now)...oh it is so good...thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a great basic recipe.  Like others, I doubled the caraway and may put in 3 or 4 T mext time.  I also added a T of poppy seed and ground flax, and gluten.  I also wanted it to rise slower so I cut the yeast in half.  It worked perfectly.  Next time, I am going to replace the water with coffee for a deeper flavor.

This is a very tasty bread but my search isnt over.  I used bread flour for the all purpose, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was a bit sweeter than I had hoped for.  Regardless, there is nothing better than fresh baked bread.

I have tried several rye bread recipes and this one is far superior in flavor to all of the others. I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour and doubled the caraway seed.  I buy my yeast in large bags instead of in packets and was confused as to how much yeast to use.  One conversion chart stated 1 1/2 tsp. = 1 packet, whereas another stated 2 tsp.  I used the lesser amount and my loaves were rather flat.  I will definitely make this bread again but will go heavier on the yeast next time. Also, will probably make it as one large loaf, as another reviewer did, so that the slices will be large enough for sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This bread came out really good, I agree with others that more caraway seeds would make it better.  Next time I will double the amount.  I let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator, then brought it to room temperature the next morning for it's second rise. I used this dough to make Reuben bread and it was fantastic!

Perfectly simple.  I made rolls instead of loaves, and they turned out great.  Proofed in a warm oven, over a pot of freshly boiled water.

This was a great recipe! Totally quick and easy to make. Though I tripled the amount of caraway seeds (because I love a heavily seeded rye). Other than that, I wouldn't change anything else about it.

I thought this bread was delicious. I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and it turned out great. Although I let it rise two times before baking, the final baked bread didn't rise all that much but it still tasted great.

Very tasty (tried it while still warm).  I added about 1/2 Tablespoon more caraway seed than called for.  Also, cooked it in two 8 inch bread pans instead of rounds.  Made "shorter" loafs than I hoped for, but tastes great just the same.

The bread was really tasty, but didn't seem to rise much on the second rise. I gave it an hour, and I know my yeast is good, but it turned out pretty flat. Sometimes that just happens. Fortunately, it rose enough not to be unpleasantly dense. The bread had the rye flavor without being overpowering.

Yes, I have tried it. May I make a suggestion? I usually make 5 or 6 loaves a week of whole grain bread from freshly milled hard red wheat, as my Bosch mixer allows me to do this, and it is actually easier and quicker than doing 1 or 2 loaves at a time by hand. 
I feel that the dough turns out better, rises more completely, if I dissolve the yeast in the full amount of water and all the sugar WITHOUT the salt. Salt will prevent the yeast from growing to its full potential. Add the salt and oil to the flour mixture instead. When the dissolved yeast/water/sugar mixture forms a nice creamy head, (about 8 minutes),almost similar to a perfectly drawn Guinness, it is time to add it to the flour, oil, salt mixture. This will ensure a better rise. When I did my loaves according to your instructions, it also did not rise well the second time, resulting in a fairly dense, heavy loaf. But all of that aside, I want to thank you for posting this recipe!!

The flavor was very nice. But, the second rise wouldn't rise fully' it only went halfway to my bread pans.

Very delicious and moist.  I doubled the caraway and ground half of it.  It gave it a very nice strong flavor.  When letting it rise, don't worry so much about the time as about the condition of your dough.  Whether it rises fast or slow depends on temperature and pressure.

I think this will be a good recipe and I will try it again. I put mine in loaf pans and baked for about 25 minutes. the inside was not done. Oops. Definitely need to bake the whole 30 minutes. It may have been because of the loaf pans but I am not sure. I made a couple small tweaks to the recipe because I started the water and yeast and then read the recipe. OK, so I am learning.

Like others I doubled the caraway seeds.  The flavor and texture are great.  I might make it as one combined loaf next time so I can make sandwiches from it, since it doesn't rise much.  Also the "ready in" time is obviously way off.  It's really like 2 hrs 15 min.

I picked this recipe as my first attempt at bread-making and was pleased overall with the result. The flavor was good; I added another teaspoon of rye seeds as well as 1 tsp of dried orange peel and 1/4 tsp or dried cardamom, both of which I ground in my coffee grinder.  I was not able to get anywhere close to kneading the dough with only the rye flour and even two of the cups of all-purpose flour; at that point when I turned it out onto the floured table it just turned into a sticky mess all over my hands. I also probably should have let rise the second time for longer than 30 minutes... although the bread tastes great, it didn't rise in my two loaf pans as much as I'd hoped and they're both pretty short loaves.

This was a lovely rye bread - nice and flavorful. Mine didn't rise quite as much as I would have liked, but that's certainly not the recipes fault. I did increase the caraway to suit my tastes.

I followed the recipe exactly and my bread turned out flat and not very flavorful. I will try a different recipe.

I made this today and it is wonderful! Tender and flavorful.  It's going to be my 'go to' recipe for rye bread. The only changes I made were reducing the amount of caraway seeds to 1 teaspoon, and because rye dough is terribly sticky, I oiled my hands liberally before keading. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best rye bread I've ever tasted. 
I love rye bread, but have never tried it fresh, only the dry version from the supermarket. This is just amazing! And was easy too!
