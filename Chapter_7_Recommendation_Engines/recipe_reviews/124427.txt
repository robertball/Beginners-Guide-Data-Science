This is my family's favourite summer salad. I use fat free sour cream and add 1 tbsp of light ranch dressing, I find it just gives an extra taste!

I took this to a 4th of July party and everyone loved it. Not only was it tasty, but it was a great alternative to all of the mayo based, high calorie salads at family picnics. The only modification I made was adding halved grape tomatoes, and I used Daisy Light sour cream(I think they make the best light or fat free sour cream).

Hey y'all!  I loved this salad, BUT I have to agree with the other reviewer that said it needed just a little more of something.  I took their advice and I added 2 tablespoons of Ranch dressing and we all loved it!!

I am Hungarian, and this is similar to my native recipe, except we add a dash of sugar to ours, and use Sweet Onion instead of green onion.

Yes!  No sugar and not overly vinegary!  Loved it.  I'm familiar with the suggestion to salt the cucumbers beforehand so they release some of their excess water and it's a good one,  but when the cucumber salad gets eaten as quickly as this did that step was totally unnecessary! I also liked the addition of the chopped green onion, which added another dimension of flavor, a little bite and great accent color - a little fresh dill would be good too. This is cucumber salad just as I like it!

I love cucumber salad.  I do not use green onion and I add a little sugar.  I have also used cider vinegar.  This is great over baked or boiled potatoes.

I made this as the recipe stated. Sometimes cucumber salad can be boring but I wouldn't  change a thing with this one. This was excellent and I don't give out five stars lightly.

Great salad.  I added a pinch of sugar too.  Thinly sliced red onions work just as well as green.  Next time I'm going to try both together.

My husband loved this and he usually stears clear of fresh vegetables unless they're drenched in ranch dressing.  This was a great side dish for BBQ chicken.

Used the T of ranch dressing as suggested by the4taals. It did give the salad some extra flavor that it needed. Nice change from the other cucumber salads I make, will make again.

Easiest & best of cucumber salads.  Easy to adjust if you have less cucumber.  Also works well with thinly sliced Vidallia-type onions.

Love love love this recipe, reminds me of all of the great Cucumber Salads I had in Germany or at Hungarian restaurants. 

A few notes - the longer you let the cucumbers sit with the salt, the better; don't be shy with the salt, you can rinse it off if it's saltier than you like (I use Kosher salt); I use my mandolin to slice the cucumbers thinly and evenly, I also use regular onion and put it in with the cucumbers and the salt; and throw in some dill - fresh or dried, it really adds a nice flavor. Enjoy! 

I have a bumper cuke crop this summer, so this is in heavy rotation!

so happy to see this recipe as i grew up on this being polish. my ma always did what kimkmom12 suggested. she did the overnight in the fridge and the next day wrapped them in a towel and squeezed all the water out. the only other difference was she used black pepper, thin sliced yellow onion and added dill weed. we always loved this and i am going to the farmers market today to get some cucumbers to make it! thanks for posting this lydia!

Wonderful with my first cucumber and red onion from the garden!  I did add ranch dressing since I just had a bit to finish off the bottle.

I'm Hungarian and this is similar to my Mom's recipe except we don't add onions. Instead we use 3 cloves of crushed garlic (love garlic) and add the sour cream right away so that the cucumbers will absorb the flavour.  Sprinkle a little red (sweet) pepper on top for decoration.

A very simple alternative to this is to use french onion dip. I've been making cucumbers this way for years.

Haven't made this in ages but needed cheap, easy side dish for summer party.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this.  I used chives from the garden instead of green onions.  There were no leftovers.

Tastes just like the cucumber dish my grandma used to make. So simple, yet so delicious! I couldn't find white pepper so I just used regular pepper. Also I did not follow the directions as stated because I think it's best when all the ingredients are mixed together and refrigerated for several hours.

This was pretty good. It definately needs a little flavor. I added a few teaspoons of dry ranch seasoning for added flavor. I would also suggest using seedless cucumbers. Mine had a lot of tough seeds! Overall pretty yummy!

I grew up eating this salad, it was a favorite. I like to marinate the cucumbers and green onions in vinegar (I use a bit more) for an hour or so , then drain out the excess and mix in the sour cream, pepper and a pinch of sugar. I sometimes throw in a bit of dill weed....love it.

Usually cut the recipe by 2/3 and just eat it as an alternative lunch salad. For my tastes, adding a dash of black pepper and a splash of half n' half makes a great salad even better. Thanks!

This is a nice old fashioned cool summer salad. It is so easy to make but try the white pepper before you add it as it has a distinctive flavor that you may not like ( I don't). Thanks for this great simple salad!!

Have made this in our family ever since I can remember!  We soak the cucumbers in salt water, drain and briefly rinse them to remove some of the salt.  We use apple cider vinegar and thinly sliced onion.  Can also use the slicer side of a grater or mandolin for thinner cucumbers.  And a whole 8 oz. container of sour cream.

Pretty basic for my tastes. I expected more of a 'zing' in the flavor. I even added a bit of Ranch dressing as other reviewers mentioned. Easy to make and a quick way to use up all these cucumbers we have, though. Thanks.

Simple and tasty!  I sliced one very large english cucumber using the crinkle slicer on the mandolin, placed the slices in a single layer on a clean towel, sprinkled very lightly with table salt.  While they were 'drying' I assembled the other ingredients.  Used paper towel and patted the slices before adding them to the bowel (with everything already mixed and well blended), then lightly tossed the slices.  The crinkles help hold that dressing SO nicely!!  Very good eats, for sure.  Also, I just happened to have made bacon bits, and had been nibbling on them as they were draining...then had a nibble of the cucumber salad.  That combo was rather tasty...

Tasty and easy.  I also used cider vinegar.  I would have tried a little Ranch dressing, but I didn’t have any on hand.  I think it would be better with a little “something extra”.

I made this last night. I did not have green onions on hand so I minced up half of a medium white onion instead.  It was pretty good!  :)  I will try the green onions next time.

This is a very good salad.  I added a little bit of chopped fresh mint leaves and garlic and really liked those additions.  I also tried this with a bit of sugar, but didn't like that as well.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This salad was delightful.  I truly loved it.  I substituted corse black pepper for the white pepper and was very pleased with the outcome (especially since I tend to use more pepper than anyone else I know)

I made this last night and am still thinking about how good it was.

I did change up the prep a bit.  I let the cucumbers drain for about 30 minutes (next time I will do this overnight) and then let them swim in a rice wine vinegar bath for about 30 minutes.  I didn't rinse off the salt before throwing the cucumbers in the vinegar.

I mixed together the sour cream, green onions, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of rice wine vinegar while the cucumbers were draining/marinating.

Then I removed the cucumbers from the vinegar, blotted them dry again, and mixed them with the sour cream.  I added some paprika on top.  It was delicious.  Served it with the spicy salmon with caramelized onions recipe from here.

It was "good" but the flavor didn't wow me, perhaps partially due to the season and the quality of the cucumber I used. But, with a little ranch dressing, as suggested by someone else, and perhaps a little dill weed to give it a flavor boost, this could be excellent especially at a summer picnic.

This has become my go-to salad whenever I feel that our dinner needed an extra kick. I love its tangy taste! This salad is very refreshing, and living in a humid country certainly makes this even better! I use quite a lot of vinegar and pepper, and I agree with one review about letting the cucumbers sit for an hour or more so that the salad will not be watery.

Just what I was looking for. I used a sweet onion as I didn't have green ones, a nice rice wine vinegar and bit of ranch dressing.

This was pretty good! My husband said my father-in-law always made this, but he added more vinegar - almost equal amounts vinegar and sour cream.  I used the measurements as instructed in this recipe and I liked it very much.  I used freshly ground black pepper. as I like it better than white and I don't mind the specks! ;)  I love the idea of adding fresh dill.  My FIL made this salad any time they served pork chops or roast pork dishes, so I always seem to associate it with that, but it's good with anything!

Very good. Reminds me of the salad I'd have in Germany. Not sweet and not too vinegary, but if I had some dill I would have added it just for a little extra flavor.

Personally, I was less than enthralled with this one; it was good at first, but quickly lost its salad- appeal as well as crispness (even after salting and blotting an english cuke).  But it went over very well with the rest of the crew, therefore the 4 stars.  Adding a little dill lightened the sour cream dressing and made it reminsicent of a tzatziki, which was enjoyable.

If you'll sprinkle about a tsp. of salt on the sliced cukes and place a weight on top of them........the salt will pull lots of the water content out within 30 minutes.  Drain to salt water off and add rest of ingredients.  We like a sm. amount of sugar added and any kind of sliced onions work fine.  I like to scoop out most of the seeds.  A true taste of summer is this recipe.

I have had this recipe for a while, I got it from T.O.H. It is very good and sure to be a hit in your home, it's a step up from mayo with cucumbers. I prepared this salad for Thanksgiving this year, which I hosted in my home. This salad was a favorite of several of my guests! It is also very simple to make it look just as beautiful in the photo if you are making it for a party.

This is like my grandmothers recipe.  I grew up on this and love it. It goes great with almost everything- from bbq to meatloaf, sandwiches, and salmon to name a few. You can add whatever you like to this as well.  I like to add some fresh tomatoes and dill for something different.  Don't be afraid to try this!

This is exactly the same as my grandmother's recipe!  I also do a variation on it where I add sliced radishes -- they add a bit of extra zing, and make it more colourful.

I made meatloaf and served the sour cream cucumber salad over a baked potato as another reviewer suggested.  It was different and my husband liked it.  I may add some garlic next time.

Easy and pretty good. Just kind of watery no matter how much I drain the cucumbers after salting them. I've made it twice and the cucumbers continue to weep. Definitely not good if leftover.

Brought back memories of my grandma! She always prepared this and set it in the refrigerator to let the flavors blend, so I did, too, and served it a couple hours later. The salad was good, with the subtle flavor I expected. After letting the salted cucumbers sit to draw out their moisture, I rinsed with water to remove overly salty flavor and then patted as dry as I could before proceeding w/the recipe (in hindsight I wonder if I should have skipped the rinsing in case the sour cream neutralized the salt adequately). Leftovers got pretty soupy the next day; if preparing in advance, you may want to do two rounds of salting of the cukes (drying with towels in between the two rounds of salting) to try to draw out even more moisture.

This was a great way to use up my cucumbers.  I have also made this before and added dried onion (instead of green), garlic salt, and dill weed.  SO YUMMY!

We'll have a large surplus of cukes from our kitchen garden, so happy to have found this recipe.  Next time I'll try it with thinly sliced red onions.

I grew up on this salad. It's really great in the summer time on hot days. Basic ingredients that you normally have on hand. Very good!

I followed this recipe to the T, all the people at my party loved it, but hubby said it needed more than the 1 tablespoon of vinegar, he added an extra cup and a half and then ate the rest of the bowl!

The only change I made was to add 1/2 packet of splenda as the vinegar was a little overwhelming for my taste.  Used the first cucumber from the garden and it was wonderfully crisp and flavorful. We'll be enjoying this recipe all summer.

I enjoyed this dish.  I used a little garlic salt and added red wine vinegar along with the reg. vinegar.  Still waiting on the hubby's vote.

This is great! 

I added one tsp of mayonnaise because I remember my husbands grandmother using both mayo & sour cream when she made this.

Also, I used very finely diced red onion instead of the green.

Hubby loved it and wants more tomorrow!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us!!
