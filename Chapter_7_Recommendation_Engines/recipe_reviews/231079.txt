Nice idea! My sorghum popped better this way a little better than with the microwave method. Using only chili oil was way too hot for me so I made a second batch using olive oil and then tossed both batches in a paper bag with some chili powder and this made it less spicy and easier to eat. Thank you Ali Shircliff for the recipe! Update 7/7/16 I tried this with Sriracha salt and...YUM!

The popped sorghum is small. I like spicy though. This was fun to make and try.
