This recipe will definately be a keeper. I made a big mistake - I used canned crabmeat and forgot to rinse it first - my crabcakes were salty!  I will definately make it again and I know it will be great. My patties stayed together fine.  I used a cast-iron pan and I believe that really makes a difference - it browned the crabcakes quickly and made an excellent crust - turning them over was no problem. Don't try turning the cakes over until you have a good crust and don't forget to rinse your canned crabmeat!

Best crab cakes I've made and I've tried alot of recipes. To keep them from falling apart I shape the mixture into balls for the first side and the after I turn them I flatten into patties. This hint came from a previous recipe and it really works!

We made these a few times and followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out great.  I chose this recipe because it called for bread instead of bread crumbs.

I wanted to modify the recipe to cut down on the number of crab cakes and added some celery and onion.  We liked the crunch of the celery.  Here's my changes.  Drain well:
1 can lump crabmeat (Lump crabmeat is the best in the can because it has the biggest pieces) – put in a strainer – press down and let sit for ½ hour to drain.  Mix: 1 egg, beaten, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 3/4 teaspoon Dijon-style prepared mustard, Couple dashes Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, 1 T finely minced onoin, small stick celery finely minced, 2 slices white bread, cut into small pieces.  Add crabmeat – gently mix.
Lightly bread the patties with cracker meal.  Fry them in olive oil until brown.  We liked them fried in olive oil for that fried taste.  We fried our first batch in butter and they just didn't taste as good to us - they didn't come out nice and crunchy like we like them.

I am from Maryland so a few hinters. Never ever flatten your crab cakes like the picture! A Mayland crabcake should be the size of your fist and fluffy. Fold in gently (to prevent shredding) of Fresh Lump Maryland Blue Crabs. A true Maryland Crabcake is 80% broiled, not fried...so broil till golden.

This recipe is very good but a bit too salty with the tablespoon of Old Bay it calls for. The second time I made it, I used just half a tablespoon of Old Bay and substituted a tablespoon of very finely chopped celery, plus a pinch each of parseley flakes, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika and allspice for the other half. 

Also, if you have trouble with these staying together, don't add extra egg, just make sure you pack your crab cakes as compactly as you can. Then, after they've been cooking for a couple of minutes, press down on the tops of the cakes with a big spatula, and whatever you do, don't try to flip or move them until they're sufficiently cooked on one side.

I added a tad less of the old bay and dijon mustard--little less salty tasting.  Also, sprayed a cookie sheet and tops of cakes with pam and baked on 375--came out just as crispy and tasty as frying in butter!

I'm from Maryland and this recipe is to die for! I made mini crab cakes as an appetizer and my friends raved over them. I added another egg and it did stay together very well. I also used crabs that I caught the day before (15 small).

i have read other reviews and i understand that apparently, crab cakes from maryland are supposed to fall apart. i'm from texas, where we think of a crab cake as sticking together. so, if you're looking for a "traditional" maryland crab cake, this may be it. if you want something that makes an actual "cake", this isn't it. i added probably 1 cup of bread crumbs to keep the crab mix together; even then i had to smush the "cakes" like i was trying to make diamonds from coal a la superman. as per other suggestions, i added less old bay, and thank goodness. the flavor was okay but not amazing. sorry, but i'll keep looking.

I've never even attempted to make crabcakes, I was shocked at how easy these were to make.  I substituted bread crumbs for the  white bread, and doubled the amount of egg...seems to make it stick together easier.  Absolutely delicious and easy!!!

As an "old lady from Baltimore" (lived right up the street from Bo Brooks), I liked this version best because of the use of bread and not bread crumbs.  I do however, use regular mustard instead of the fancy kind (it's what we used in the old days)!  To keep them from falling apart simply make your crabcakes and place them on a cookie sheet in your fridge for an hour or so until they are "set".  This always works for me!

Mine fell apart too...think next time I'll use cracker crumbs and add another egg.  I'll likely also add some green onion to add to the flavor.

This is a truly authentic MARYLAND-style crab cake. In Maryland, you don't want a crab cake that is all tiny bits of crab, and you try to use as little bread/bread crumbs as possible. The goal is to have a huge lump of crab meat that tastes like you have just picked a crab or two and have saved all the meat to eat at once! 

One thing that I have found over the years that helps to preserve the crab meat so that it doesn't shred or break down is to mix everything but the crab before hand, and then gently toss the crab in at the end. I did cut back a bit on the Old Bay, and I prefer broiling my crab cakes to frying them. Since the meat is already completely cooked when you purchase it, there is no need to cook them for long--the goal is simply to have them heated through. And if you are using crab meat from a can, at least be sure to purchase the jumbo lump meat, not the "fancy" shredded up kind.

The texture this recipe creates is perfect. However, I'm curious whether the Old Bay shouldn't be "1 tsp" as opposed to the "1 tblsp" in the recipe - it overpowers the other ingredients in my opinion.        
     Maybe it's me - less is more and all that. (Even the crabcake recipe on the Old Bay Seasoning can calls for just the teaspoonful per pound of crabmeat.) Any other opinions?

This recipe fails to tell you to refrigerate your mixture for at least 30 minutes before making patties. THAT is your key to having your patties retain their shape while cooking.

This was pretty good! However I divide into 4 cakes. It is imortant to note that fresh lump blue crab is really much better than any canned crab. It also helps to refigerate the cakes for about a half hour before frying. It really helps them hold together.

this is a fantastic recipe.  I did cut back on the Old Bay to 1/2 of what it called for.  My family just raved about them.  Definately a keeper.  A must try.

Perfect crab cakes!  I used panko breadcrumbs and a little less Old Bay.  They are good fried but they are just as good broiled for 10 minutes (brushed the tops w/ a little melted butter first).

I made a couple changes:
1. used a hamburger bun instead of bread b/c it's all I had
2. used 1 tsp of old bay instead of 1 T
3. used olive oil rather than butter to fry
4. chilled the patties for 30 minutes before cooking
5. baked in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes after frying for 4 min on each side

I didn't have any problems w/ the patties coming apart... I had chilled them based on other reviews, so maybe that was it.  My husband said this one was a keeper!

I made this as an appetizer for a large party, doubling the recipe.  I added my own variation: after preparing exactly as described, I lightly coated the crab cakes in bread crumbs and then fried them until brown.  I didn't feel they were cooked through and through, so I baked them for about 15 minutes on 350.  They were perfect!  YUMMY!

This recipe is great! It was so easy and turned out great.  I usually don't care for crab cakes, but these are amazing! The Old Bay gave it a strong taste, but I liked them that way. These are by far the best seafood I've tasted in a while. And, yes, I do live in Maryland.

The Best Crab Cakes we've ever had.  The crab dominates which is a TRUE CRAB CAKE! you could cut back on the old bay a bit but I think the key to this recipe is to cook on VERY LOW HEAT. It does stick together you just have to be careful!

I used imitation crab meat, but the big chunks of it fell apart even when more bread was added.  After a couple attempts became a loose mess of imitation crab meat, I tossed the mixture into the food processor for a few pulses. When it was chopped into finer pieces, it formed into nice little cakes that cooked intact.
They all tasted great, but the minced ones looked like real crabcakes.

These are wonderful! I was looking for an authentic, simple recipe that would highlight the flavor of a beautiful fresh Dungeness crab and I found it! I used egg substitute and and light whole wheat bread and seasoned salt instead of Old Bay (that's what I had on hand). Also just used a pan spray and a dab of light butter to cook them to reduce the fat. They are still some of the best I ever had. Thank you, John!

i'm from maryland and this is how crabcakes should be made. i tend to use breadcrumbs and dry mustard though, those are my only differences in the actual recipe. and i prefer my crabcakes broiled/baked instead of fried. and i agree with krazi4, that the key is to use lump crab meat. it's generally more expensive but it's definitely worth it. if you're looking for a good MARYLAND crabcake recipe, this is it.

My husband LOVED these (once he dipped them in butter.)  Says they were the best crab cakes he has ever eaten.  Unfortunately, they fell apart, even after an extra egg.  (That is why the 4.)  If it wasn't for that, they would have been a 5.  Also, I cut the Old Bay in half so it did not over power the crab.

This recipe was great and so incredibly easy I will make this again and again.  My husband was super impressed.  I made a remoulade sauce which went really well with these crab cakes.

These are just awesome!  The only thing I would change is adding a bit more bread.  But I made them for company, and they raved over them!  Thank you for such a great receipe!

This IS a very good  crab cake recipe.  For those unfamiliar with Old Bay, it IS a key ingredient with eating crabs in Maryland...like corned beef and rye-they go together.   And adding it to this recipe is a great idea.  If one is able to get fresh crab meat, go for it...much better.

I love this recipe, reminds me of home on the Potomac...You have to use OLD BAY seasoning that's what makes the crabcakes...

Don't get all the rave reviews----?  Fell apart terribly, added more mayonnaise and bread, still fell apart when trying to flip in the pan, Old Bay was overpowering!  Major flop at my cookout:(

I orgininally made them exactly as stated in the recipe, but they wouldn't hold together at all.  I added another piece of bread and another egg and it held together a little better, though some did break up during cooking.  Next time I'll add more Old Bay Seasoning since the extra egg and bread made them a little bland, but I will try them again.

Grew up and Maryland and this is a great recipe!
I used lump crabmeat - even better.  I also used cooking spray to cut the fat down to almost nothing.  I would suggest adding the crackers slowly as you stir - you'll probably not want to use the amount it calls for - makes for too much filler.

This was delicious.  I made this for my Italian Christmas Eve Fish dinner and everyone loved them.  If I make them again, I may add another egg to make them stick better, but it wasn't a real problem - just had to be very gentle.  The taste was amazing.  Thanks!!

I only discovered this website a few weeks ago and I have made this recipe twice (And will be making it again this week too).  I confess that I use imitation crabmeat. I also add a minced green onion. I serve it with adipping sauce of mayo, orange marmalade and curry.  Even my kids love it.

I love crab cakes and now my own crab cakes are my favorite.  I can never stick to a recipe, so I added to this recipe and combined a few ingredients from "Maryland Crab Cakes III" , but it was great.  I used bread crumbs and corn meal instead of saltines or bread crumbs, I added green onions and some other spices, but it was great!  I served it with "Trader Joe's" tartar sauce and everyone flips over them!!

I just looked into this site and I see that these recipe comments were made quite some time ago.  In answer to METAPEDE the one who said don’t add an extra egg because they felt it would stop it from falling apart.  That is wrong! The eggs are a binder and breading and cracker crumbs are an extenders, which help make more but take away from the true flavor and cheapen the value.   Remember the more inert ingredients you put in the less crab flavor will be there.  However, if you want to accent it with your personal touch like a little( I mean little)wine, chives onion, or celery go a head but keep in mind that the more you put in the further you get away from that good old Chesapeake Maryland flavor crab cakes.  The think this recipe stands well all by itself!  Sincerely, the Flying Cook

OMG, very good and easy, only thing I did different, I spray cooking sheet with olive oil cooking spray, then brush olive oil on top of crab cakes,so they wouldn't be dry, bake in oven on 475, it was a hit everyone at work think I can really cook.

I am a native Marylander.  Since I haven't tried to make this recipe, I have given it 4 stars.  According to the Old Bay Seasoning recipe on side of container, it calls for 2 teaspoons of Old Bay Seasoning, not 1 tablespoon.

The ingredients for this recipe sounded perfect.  I read the reviews and felt it would be a great one.  However, the crab cakes did not stay together when I put them in the pan.  I removed them, added another egg, more bread crumbs before trying to cook them again.  Even with the added add and bread, the Old Bay seasoning (which I love, usually) overpowered the crab cakes.  I won't make these again!What were others thinking?

These Maryland Crab Cakes turned out great!
Next time I will just use a teaspoon of Old Bay.
They were a little bit to spicy for my children.
This is the best Maryland Crab Cake recipe I have made so far.

An excellent recipe (although I pan fried them, then finished them in the oven, which is the "Maryland Way;" I'm a chef and native of MD's Eastern Shore). I see the criticisms, and you're right: they can be crumbly...the trick is getting them just right. "Authentic" Maryland crab cake recipes can vary quite a bit; a Maryland crab cake is really less of an ingredients list than a philosophy: plenty of Jumbo Lump crabmeat, with just enough filler to bind it together. Thus, the "perfect" Maryland crab cake is the one that, if you were to add any less filler, would fall apart. Personally, instead of the bread, I prefer cracker meal, but you will find a different blend of filler in virtually every chef's kitchen...The crabs are the important part, and although I'll always be partial to Maryland blue crab, I must say that the blue crabs they harvest on the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina are (almost) just as good...but don't tell my folks!

Born and raised in Maryland I KNOW what a good crab cake should taste like and these are IT!  I add a bit more worcestershire sauce and the key is to use LUMP crab meat. I prefer mine fried in butter on the skillet (cause what's crab w/o dipped in melted butter? lol) and they taste wonderful!

I just made this with fresh Oregon crab.  Didn't have the Bay seasoning, added a little green onion and fresh parsley; used organic whole wheat bread; sauteed it in olive oil rather than butter for health reasons.  Flavor was exquisite.  Best since I was in Maryland some years back.

Best crab cakes I have ever made. And I have made hundreds. Used green onions and left out the other onions. Great done in the broiler and not fried. And no eggs, a plus. This will be the recipe I'll we will be using now.

Really enjoyed this with rice although I couldn't get the crab and mixture to really stick together.  I had more of a scrambled crab over rice.  It was good though.  What did I do wrong?

Fantastic recipe.  This was my first time making crab cakes and it was so easy.  My husband begged for these on his birthday.  I would suggest a little less Old Bay.

I did not like the flavor of this at all.  I put the crab mixture in the refrigerator for an hour and the crab cakes still fell apart.  My partner loved it, but I was not pleased.

They didn't look very pretty (I think that had more to do with me as the cook versus the recipe) - but they were very good.  I added some corn to the mix and then used it as a main dish for my 6 year old and I.  Very good!

Wonderful! I added some dried parsley, but followed the recipe otherwise. For a dipping sauce, I used equal parts dijon mustard and mayo, then added a bit of my favorite hot sauce, Pukka Hot Pepper Sauce. Enjoy!

I did this but I changed cracker crumbs instead of bread. Turned out great. Mix the wet ingredients first for better consistency.

Growing up on Maryland and a crab cake lover this is very close to how I was taught.  Some hints for those not from Maryland; Best to use fresh Maryland Blue Crab if possible.  If you have to use canned then use Lump meat and drain it with a strainer or towels for 30 min.  mix liquid ingred together first and fold in the meat; the idea is to keep the meat in large "Lumps".  A good cake does not need alot of additional ingred (onion, celery..etc) and Broiled is the best both for taste (in my opinion) and to keep it together.  Bread with the ends removed and ripped into little pieces makes the best cake...good luck and hope you enjoy.

Very Good!  I used 1/2# crab, reduced the Old Bay and Wor. sauce  to 1/2tsp. and kept the other amounts the same.  I also shaped into balls as another reviewer suggested and fried in EVOO.  I rated as 4 stars since mine were very mushy inside.  They didn't hold together at all when I used less bread. Also, same problem when I used imitation crabmeat another time. Looking at the photo, I do notice that the picture shows them much flatter than I made.  I do wonder if the white bread turned to mush once it hit was mixed in??  My husband and I liked them, but I probably won't make for company.

What type of mustard (Dijon or regular) and the amount of Old Bay is up to the cook. However, for true Maryland crab cakes don't add more ingredients than what this recipe calls for (some do substitute crushed saltines for the bread). No onion, no peppers, no celery, etc. You can call them crab cakes, but not true Maryland crab cakes.

Delicious crab cakes!  I made according to the recipe, except that I used wheat bread instead of white.  Also, I broiled the crab cakes rather than frying.  Will definitely use this recipe again!  

(Like other reviewers said, they do tend to fall apart easily, but that doesn't bother me!)

I think crab was one of the first pieces of solid food I ate!  I was born and raised in Maryland and crab cakes are a serious issue here!  This is a great recipe base, but I have to say...a little too much old bay. I would cut to 1-2 tsp/to taste....and yes, you can taste the raw mixture.  I also prefer a spice called J&O because it contains old bay and adds rock salt and some other essential ingredients!  I agree with others who say you should broil to preserve the crab flavor and NEVER shred or beat the crab meat.  It should be FOLDED in very last!  Gave it 5 starts cuz if you sub the bread for cracker crumbs it is my grandma's recipe!

A lot less of the Old Bay Seasonings, too over-powering, maybe 1 teaspoon and add lemon zest. Fry in a light oil instead of butter. Didn't like this recipe much

This is wonderful. I made it with sourdough bread, 2 eggs, and cooked them in 3/4 stick butter on medium heat. I made them into balls and flattened them only after cooking for 4 mins. They stayed together beautifully. I served them with lemon wedges and homemade cocktail sauce. Delicious!

These crab cakes are awesome, and are made even better because of they are nicely crispy on both sides.  It is a very easy recipe (NO chopping!) and so quick to throw together.  Just great.

Good tasting but would not stay together.  All the patties were mushed into like a stir fry by the end of trying to flip them.   Tasted good, but I wouldn't make it again if I wanted patties.

This recipe was very disappointing.  Not only was the Old Bay Seasoning too powerful, but the cakes would not stay together!  I have been looking for a yummy crab cake recipe and this one is definitely not it!!

I have NEVER made crab cakes before, wasn't so keen on them, but WOW!! Delicious!  I used 227gm of immitation crab (should have used more), used 2 eggs, and 1 extra piece of bread.  WOW!  Flaky, tasty.. I didn't have the Seasoning requested, so I used Cayenne, Paprika and Garlic Powder, Pepper and Salt.  And for an AWESOME side dip, A few pieces of jarred roasted red peppers, a half cup to a cup of mayonaise, and a few teaspoons to tablespoons of chili sauce *depends how hot you like it*  WHAT AN EXCELLENT DISH!!!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU!

Just what I expected. Like reviewer anchrista,  I too made the mistake of not rinsing my canned crab the last time. However, I thought the saltiness came because I was at the bottom of my old bay can and thought perhaps all the celery salt had settled to the bottom. Thanks to her post I now know where I messed up. I learned to also fill a bowl with cold water then empty the can of crab into the bowl gently swish the crab around then pour into a strainer . This keeps the crab from breaking up. Lay out on paper towel a few minutes to absorb the water. Don't press.

I think this is a great basic recipe. I read many of the reviews, and took several of the suggestions when making it. 

I used canned claw crab meat. I didn't wash it, but did put it out on paper towels to draw the excess moisture out. I think this is a must do to prevent it from being soggy. 

I used 2 eggs. Many suggested this, and its a good one. 

No way 2 pieces of bread would work. I used two complete hamburger buns, top and bottoms. Worked ok, but next time I'll use 3.

I minced some green onions and added them to  it.  Next time I'll use red or yellow onion, finely minced. I used about 1/4 cup. 

Added some finely diced celery too, about 1/4 cup. Gave it some crunch and texture. It didn't hide the great crab meat taste. 

I did use the tablespoon of Old Bay. I started with a teaspoon as someone suggested, but, after adding just 1 tsp, I decided to go the whole tablespoon. Didn't regret it, and it didn't overpower the taste of the crab to us.

Also added some black pepper, about a teaspoon, and some granulated garlic, a teaspoon. This was good, and it still didn't overpower the crab. 

Put the 2 tablespoons of butter in a cast iron skillet, but it wasn't enough. Added a bottom coat of canola oil to the butter, and it did perfectly. Fried the first couple of cakes about 4 minutes a side. This was too long. Next two I cooked for 3 1/2 minutes, just right for my stove and pan. Perfect crust. 

I noticed when forming the cakes, either in a ball or patty, they did tend to b

I lived in Baltimore for 10 years and since moving to Virginia, have attempted to find a genuine Maryland Crabcake recipe.  THIS IS IT!   Perfect!  Just like you find in the crab shacks.  THANK YOU! Flattening is optional...I flattened it so I could get the crispy brown sides.  I have broiled crabcakes and they turn out very dry.  Also...never use canned crab meat.  It doesn't taste anything like fresh crab.  If you live near the shore, buy a bushel of fresh or pre steamed crabs and pick any crabs that are leftover from your crab feast...If you don't live near the shore, buy a tub of fresh crabmeat in the meat section of a grocery store. I have made crab cakes that fall apart....but never when I lived in Baltimore so they should hold together...that's want the egg is for.

This is one lady from Baltimore who really enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to prepare and the results were excellent.  I would have given it a 5 star, but there's a restaurant in Baltimore that makes the ABSOLUTE best crabcakes around (G&M) and I think there may be a secret ingredient that they use that I still haven't quite figured out what it is.  Nonetheless, this was a very nice recipe.  Thank You John L.

Simply amazing. I've seen so many recipes that have endless ingrediants that in the end, overpower the main attraction. This recipe is so simple and the ingrediants are very small only to complement the crab. Very delicious and exactly the way Maryland crab cakes are supposed to be. I only made one small tweek and that was to hit the pan with a small shot of lemon juice to give a subtle hint of citrus. Wonderful job!

This is a terrific recipe! The 1 T. of Old Bay was just right for a little zing when combined with the Dijon mustard. Didn't quite taste like it had enough salt but will probably make it the same the next time because it grew on me as I ate it. Husband loved it!! I did add parsley to mine. I did have to cook mine a little longer to get a nice crust but it was still nice and moist inside. Keep those lumps! That's what makes crab cakes taste so good. Thanks John L., this recipe is a keeper for my family!

I ran out of worcestershire sauce and they tasted great anyway. I definitely recommend usingfresh or semi fresh crabmeat from the seafood section of the grocery store.  I used lump claw meat (on sale) which resulted in great flavor. I used 1 tsp old bay for a milder seasoning. I mounded them up like another reviewer suggested and broiled 10 min instead of fried.  They will be quite wet when you form them and place them in the oven so don't overdo it on the breadcrumbs because they will dry out. Great recipe.

This was excellent.  The crab meat I had purchased was Maryland backfin crab meat in a vaccum packed bag.  I had to add one additional slice of bread to get my desired consistancy.  I used potatoe bread rather than white.  It was yummy!  Thank you for posting!

The recipe is excellent - have made it many times.  Actually, my husband's friend has actually brought me over the ingredients to make it for him!!  3 changes I make - I toast the bread and crumble before adding, I add garlic salt, usually around 3 TB and  I dip cakes in bread crumbs before I cook.  It holds them together better!!

Very good recipe. I had to substitute my own mix of seasonings because I didn't have old bay. I also broiled them in the oven. May try adding a bit more mayo to make the mixture more rich.

I did not make any changes to this recipe. I made this for my husband for his birthday he loves it. Found out that my son who is autistic and has texture issues also loves these crab cakes so I will definitely be making this often. it looks like a traditional Maryland style crab cake and my wife made it perfect.

Made as written and my husband and I both liked it a lot. Only thing I would change next time I make this recipes is to use 2 teaspoons Old Bay instead of 1 tablespoon.

Followed the recipe pretty closely with the modifications suggested in other reviews...

1) selected a good white bread (probably made no difference but with the price of crab meat why skimp?)
2) less Old Bay - about 2/3 Tbsp
3) used yellow mustard instead of Dijon
4) folded in the crab after mixing the other ingredients well
5) chilled in fridge for an 45-60 minutes and then broiled for around 10 minutes

Crabs cakes stuck together nicely and came out excellent!

I liked the recipe. The addition of the egg was a good idea since it helped bond the crab cakes together as they cooked.  Having said that, a rich cheese/cream sauce is  needed.  For that, I placed some diced sharp  cheese in a sauce pan, along with a half cup of cream, and small amounts of garlic and parsley paste.. Once the sauce is heated to consistency, it can be poured over the crab cakes.

The only change I made instead of bread I used 6 unsalted saltine crackers. I let all ingredients marinade together about 30 minutes and carefully folded mixture into lumb crab meat.  I added about 2 table spoons of olive oil with the 2 table spoons of butter  in a frying pan waited until pan was hot place my crab cake in the hot oil and butter fried on both sides and they came out wonderful taste was good an texture of the crab cake was delicious.

Made them exactly as recipe fell apart and had a devil of a time keeping them as a patty. I always make them with bread crumbs not fresh bread. Taste was good but would not make this recipe again. They were not wonderful as others wrote.

"Maryland" crab cakes for sure! Seen many recipes here without the old Bay which borders on being sacrilegious! They will not fall apart if turned gently and the pan has sufficient oil. Yes, the first few times you make these they may fall apart but a little practice will alleviate that. These are great!

Needs more binder. I ended up using a lot more eggs and it needs more old bay, maybe a fresh herb like cilantro and how could they leave out the hot sauce?

Lots of good flavor.  Had a bit of problem with the patties staying together, so I made the patties and refrigerated them for half hour.  Held together better.  All 6 patties disappeared.

Sole recipe I use for crab cakes!  Only change I make is to use whole wheat or 9 grain bread for breadcrumbs, and I serve with the mango salsa recipe on this site.  We have them every year for Easter, and it is a top family birthday meal request.

I grew up close to Baltimore and these crabcakes are better than restaurant quality. I had fresh picked crab, so I'm not sure if i had a full pound. I think it was closer to 1/2lb. I used spicy brown mustard not Dijon because it's what I had on hand. Everything else I followed, and they are perfect. I strongly recommend this recipe!

I did add a few crushed crackers (Ritz) instead of all the bread to help them hold together a bit better. But, rave reviews from my family! I made them for us, our daughter and her husband (just had a baby) and our son and daughter-in-law...they just got married! I tripled the recipe to spread the joy! YUM! Daughter in law said one of her top 3 favorites ever!

Made a smaller recipe because I just was making a couple of cakes from leftover crabs. They were fabulous! A little spicy, but great.

I cut old bay to 1&1/4 tsp. Added 1/2 cup finely chopped onion. Formed into patties and LET REST IN FRIDGE FOR AN HOUR!!! This allows mixture to set and keeps cakes together. I broiled these on a greased cookie sheet 6 minutes each side. Yield was 6 good sized cakes. If you fry them, use only melted Crisco shortening!

Exactly right. These are true Maryland crab cakes. For the right texture, be sure to use back fin lump crabmeat.

Delicious!! The only thing I did different was 3 slices of bread & 2 eggs (my eggs were medium size). If you have 1 jumbo egg I think that would be perfect. I also read where you should rinse your canned crab meat (which is what I used) and squeeze out any excess water. It worked out perfectly. My family all loved this recipe!
