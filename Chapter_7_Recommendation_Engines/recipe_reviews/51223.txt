Yummy! This is a great and simple recipe. I made it a few times. The second time, I used two vanilla beans because I had a lot of them in the cupboard and I really like the vanilla taste. I put the used beans into my brewing vanilla extract (on this site).

This was great! A little sweet, but not too many calories. We added another 1 Tbsp of butter and a bit more sugar to coat better.

The tasters have spoken, and it was a resounding: "iffy" on the taste. The folks who liked it really liked it and the folks who didn't... really didn't.

This was amazing!  I was craving a sweet snack, but I'm trying to avoid cookies and sweets, so this was a great light way to get some sugar in.  Totally satisfied my craving, and so easy to make.

Thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family, and MUCH better than all the vanilla syrup-coated recipes I found before finding this one.  I wished the vanilla was stronger but it does say "hint of vanilla" in the description.  Here's what I'll try next time to coax a little more flavor out: I put the used vanilla bean into a container of sugar to make vanilla sugar, which I've been meaning to try for years now.  Next time I'll toss the scraped beans into the vanilla sugar to boost the flavor.  I think I'll also infuse some oil with another vanilla bean and pop the corn in that.  At any rate, I will definitely make this again and again for our family Friday night movie and popcorn night.

It's quick and easy to make, and the kids really enjoy eating it!  Can barely taste the vanilla flavor even after using vanilla sugar.

I made this for a girls' gathering. Everyone loved it! My vanilla bean crisped up in the Whirly Pop so I wasn't able to scrape the seeds very well but I could see plenty of the lovely flecks from popping the corn with the bean. Yum!
