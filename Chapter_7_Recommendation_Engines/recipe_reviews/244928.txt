This pie turned out great. It would have been easier if the recipe called for a particular amount of lemon juice instead of “juice from 2 1/2 lemons”. My lemons were huge so I had to research the equivalents. Other than that, the recipe was easy to follow and we enjoyed the flavors and zero refined sugar!

This is the BEST and easiest pie I have ever made!  When a neighbor shared from their abundant  lemon trees I wondered what I was going to do with them all? Being familiar with Agave syrup (we use it in our coffee) l figured I’d try it in this pie.  It turned out tart/sweet and very lemony.  I loved sharing it with my neighbor who is borderline diabetic.  It was a hit and I’m going to make another one today!  BTW, I don’t make crusts.  I’m “dough”  challenged!  Marie Calendar’s are great!

I wanted to try this since it didn't call for sugar & I use Agave regularly.  It was delicious.  I didn't miss the sugar at all.  The meringue was a bit funky, but still tasty.  I added a bit more zest for the twang, but other than that I followed the recipe exact.  I would be doing this one again.
