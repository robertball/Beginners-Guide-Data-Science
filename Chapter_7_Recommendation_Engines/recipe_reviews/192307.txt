4.16.16   Well, I'm giving this 5 stars because there's nothing at all I would change in this recipe...it's good! The lime juice gives this sauce just the right amount of tanginess, and then a little bit of heat creeps in from the chili peppers.   Although unorthodox, we used it as a dipping sauce for pork and cabbage dumplings, and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing this simple-to-make recipe.
