I added hot pepper rings for spice and a can of garbanzo beans.  Near the end I added a can of artichoke hearts.  The meal was excellent!  I served it over rice.  My turkey breast was frozen, I cooked it 6 hours on high and it turned out perfectly!

This was a good recipe. I added a little water to mine because the onions were burning to my slow cooker. The fregrence of the turkey filled my house in the first hour and smelled so good! I left out the olives but followed the recipe otherwise. The turkey was moist and very flavorful too! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Very complex, distinct flavor - a great recipe. I read some of the comments about dry turkey. I hate dry turkey. So I used a probed crockpot. It shuts down the heat when the meat reaches desired temperature. I prepared the turkey per recipe, using chicken stock instead of broth. I also added 3 bay leaves for clarifying effect. I substituted the roasted tomato with diced canned tomatoes. We opted to make this recipe healthier without any additional oils or salt. The end result was spectacular. The gravy went well with the potatoes we made as well as the turkey itself.

I made this for dinner tonight and had to give my dad the stink-eye-- he went back for so many helpings that I was worried I wouldn't have any leftover for lunch tomorrow!

I quartered a chicken instead of using turkey breast and sprinkled feta over the dish before serving which gave it a nice, lemony kick. I didn't like how tasteless the sun dried tomatoes were after cooking, so when I make this again, I'll add some in the last half hour with artichoke hearts so they retain their flavor. Cooked on high for four hours, served over rice, and delicious!

Flavor was good, the turkey totally dried out.  This would be better if it wasn't slow cooked.

This was REALLY tasty!  I did nearly double the olives and sundried tomatoes because we love them and it used the entire container of each.  Also, instead of chicken broth, I used some Pinot Grigio white wine, which added a ton of flavor and helped to tenderize the turkey.

One thing I did that I think really kept the turkey moist was to set it all up the night before and combined it all in a crock pot liner that I refrigerated overnight, so it basically marinated in the wine and brine.  I also just quartered and squeezed a lemon and left the lemons in with the meat and everything. The turkey was taken out of its net and I seasoned it directly then ladled a little bit of everything over the top and then put the little bit of skin on top to baste it naturally as it cooked. Added some artichoke hearts about 45 minutes before it was done and dissolved the cornstarch in some more wine and it was FABULOUS. I've been instructed this must be put into regular rotation!

My guests and picky husband said it was the best turkey they'd EVER had.  I didn't have greek seasoning on hand. I used Moroccan seasoning and some roasted red peppers.  Added yams and garbanzos. yum.

We really loved this as an alternative to the usual "roast turkey" in the oven. I couldn't find Greek seasoning at the store so I used a Mediterranean rub I make from scratch instead with a bit of lemon zest in it. Turkey turned out moist, very flavorful and easy to make. Can't beat that for dinner! :) Will make this again, for sure.

I made my own Greek seasoning, used diced tomatoes & some of the oil from marinated  artichokes.  Added the artichokes in the last hour.  I cooked this for 5 hours on low using a 2 lb turkey breast.  I also added a can of garbanzo beans and used cornstarch slurry rather than flour.  I served it over orzo.

I love this recipe, it is easy and a crowd pleaser on mashed potatoes. I always shred the meat (turkey or chicken) and put it on the potatoes.

Loved this recipe! Used less turkey because that's all I had and it came out very tender and juicy. Couldn't find the seasoning at the grocery store, but I made my own by googling online. Poured the extra sauce mixture over white rice and it tasted amazing. Even my picky 13-year old son ate it without a complaint. Thanks for the great recipe!

I added an equal amount of green olives, a small jar of artichoke hearts and two (one too many for kids) habanero peppers and doubled the amount of broth (so it is great with rice!).  Turned out great, in fact I ate so much that it hurt!

I'm always looking for new recipes that have a lot of flavor and my husband will like.  This one did the trick.  I did increase the amount of chicken broth as my husband likes his dinners with lots of sauce.  That is the only change I made.
Glad it was just the two of us so we now have lots of leftovers.

I like the tender taste to the turkey breast. My husband was not fond of the kalamata olives, but I thought it was a nice punch to the meal.

This recipe didn't work for us.  We used a bone-in turkey breast and we were constantly spitting out small pieces of bone.  Also, it was bland - low calories but not much taste.

My guests absolutely loved this, even the one who said afterward that she did not like olives or sun-dried tomatoes.. Cook a bit less time, as I put a meat thermometer in after about 5 hours and it was done. I used a three pound boneless turkey breast.

This recipe is terrific!  I used jarred bruschetta mix instead of the sundried tomatoes and added a 14 ounce can of artichoke heart.  My husband and I loved it!  Leftovers were great!

Followed the recipe with the exception of using a 3 lb Butterball turkey breast roll and substituting 3/4 teaspoon onion powder for the onion (only because I was out of onion).  The turkey came out very moist, but the marinade was pretty salty and also seemed to lack a strong flavor.  I served it over brown rice.  If I make it again I will add some peppers to give it more zing.   Family enjoyed it, but I doubt it will be in the rotation.
