I made a lot of changes. I used one small real onion, cooked it for a bit, put in the almonds, cooked until they were golden, added two cloves of  garlic, and cooked for another minute or two. Then I added two large pieces of candied ginger chopped fine, some "Better than Bouillon" chicken flavor and about a half cup of water, put a lid on it (cracked slightly) and let it cook until nearly all of the liquid evaporated. It was delicious. Everyone loved it, including the person who hates green vegetables and the person who hates vegetables in general.

The taste is fantastic.  It is very easy to put together once the nuts are shelled (I used pecans because I have them on hand!) The ginger adds to the flavor without distracting the taste or smell of the celery.  I'll be having this again soon!

A friend gave me this recipe in 1978.  I think it was a Southern Living recipe.  The only thing different is that the 2 tablespoons of white wine were left out!  Anyway, it is a delightful way to serve ce!ery.  It is especially good with sweet potatoes and a pork chop or broiled fish.  My husband always raves about this and I love it, too.

OMG with limited ways to use celery this one is a keeper! I too changed items but only bc I am a fan of using what I already have... so it was peanuts instead of almonds...French Fried onions and garlic saut√©ed in the butter... no sugar bc I used this amazing Honey seasoning. I looooooveed the end result!

Used walnuts toasted with ginger and butter it was AWESOME. Especially since we started the keto diet and my body has been wanting a pasta or rice dish. This was an incredible and healthy substitute

I made this for my husband who typically tuns up his nose whenever celery is in front of him, but he very much enjoyed this and asked for it again!  This will make its way into my recipe book.

I enjoyed this but my husband not so much. I would probably try making this with olive oil instead of butter to make it a little healthier.

Great recipe; whole family liked it. Since making it the first time, I no longer measure the celery. I just use all of the medium and large stalks of one head, trimmed. Comes out well every time.

Kind of bland. And that's after adding a clove of garlic and chopped green onion. Maybe some dried cranberries next time? But there probably won't be a next time.
