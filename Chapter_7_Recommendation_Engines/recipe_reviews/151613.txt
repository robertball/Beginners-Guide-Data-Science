Quite a few people complained that this lacked flavor/was too bland. That was not the case for us! I made the following modifications: I cooked the chicken in butter with garlic salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and a little McCormick taco seasoning. I added the cheddar cheese soup and the salsa, and blended until they had melted together. I tasted the sauce and found it was still a tiny bit on the bland side, so I added more black pepper and crushed red pepper. I made the fiesta rice with Uncle Ben's instant brown rice instead of white, and followed all of the same directions. I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of hot water at the end of the cook time to make sure the rice didn't burn and was cooked thoroughly. I added black pepper and crushed red pepper to the rice as well. These were spicy and delicious! My fiancé loved them, and ended up eating the chicken sans tortilla because the sauce was so good! Definitely a keeper! If you find yours is too bland, add your favorite spices! Stir, taste, and add some more! Cooking is an experiment...I never follow recipes exactly and they always turn out better for it! ;)

cooked chicken in crockpot with water.  Used this broth for the rice.  Added chedder cheese and milk to shredded chicken along with some taco seasoning.  Sauted onions with oil.  Added half the onions to shredded chicken.  added 1 1/2 cups of rice and browned.  Added chicken broth and a little extra water to equal 2 cups.  added a little salsa and left un covered to be done quicker.  Added chicken mixture to tortillas and bakes as directed.  YUM!

Sorry but I didn't enjoy this at all, and neither did the kids. I think I will stick to my original chicken Quesadilla recipe.

My husband hates Mexican food but he loved this.  It was cheesy and gooey, even the baby enjoyed it :) The rice turned out great also.  Not your typical Mexican dish, but delish!!

I used a McCormick fajita seasoning packet when cooking the chicken and mixed the soup and medium heat chunky salsa with it when it was nearly all evaporated and it came out spicy and amazing.

This recipe is great, but it seems that there is something else needed in the quesadillas and I cant put my finger on what. The rice was absolutely amazing. I have fixed both twice now and will definitely be fixing it again.

This shocked me by being very simple and quick and tasty as well.  My husband and children loved them and asked for them again.  I do agree that (to me, at least) it seems like there's something missing..  I definitely could taste that it was mainly cheddar cheese soup making up the content of the quesadillas.  I'll try maybe spicing it up more or adding some other type of sauce to it as well next time I make it.  I will definitely make these again though - so quick and easy for something so enjoyable to everyone in my home.  Recipes like this I hold on to!

It was good, but not great. I agree that there seems to be something missing in the Quesadillas - maybe a layer of refried beans would make them better? My grocery store doesn't carry canned Cheddar soup so instead we used shredded cheese and some milk - still came out great (maybe better?) We also added about half a cup of cheese to the rice and used real rice rather than instant - works the same. To add heat, use Cabot's Mexican Blend shredded cheese - I'm not really one for heat so we used the classic Fancy Blend.

I've made this recipe for years. As directed it is probably only a 3-star recipe. To make it four (I would have given it 4 1/2 if that was an option)--pre-cook the chicken (poaching in boiling water works great) and shred it instead of cutting it into pieces. While the chicken is cooking, make the rice and then add half of it to the chicken and soup mixture.

I add 1 whole diced seeded jalapeno pepper and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro to the rice dish. It kicks it up a notch.

My kids loved this, but it was a little too salty for my taste.  I should have used fresh/frozen chicken breast but instead used can chicken.  With the can chicken and the can soup, the salt content was a little high.  Also, I added beans to make these go further.  I will make these again, but I will not use can chicken.

As is is pretty bland but I added 1 can of black beans, drained, and some chili powder and extra cumin.  Really added a great taste and fiber from the beans.  My family really loves them this way!

I have been making these quesadillas for several years, and my family loves them.  I used to use the seasoned Tyson chicken meat, but now I use chicken breast & sprinkle them with McCormick fajita seasoning before cooking...great flavor.

The rice definitely made this dish. I used regular rice instead of instant so I had to add more rice versus liquid. It came out great! The quesadillas were very easy and also tasted great. I will probably try green chilies or jalapeños in the mix next time, just for some added pop. Thank you for this recipe! I think it will become a regular.

I totslly agree regarding the lack of flavor and too gooey consistency although my 10yr old loved it! Next time I'll season the chicken w/pkg Taco seasoning and add only half can of soup.

Excellent flavor, but I made the following changes: I added to the chicken 1 can of rinsed black beans and 1 small can of green chiles.  I also added a fajita seasoning pack and this all added together gave the chicken a great flavor!  The rice tasted fabulous, but I had to boil the rice for about 7 minutes with the rice in, and then let sit about 7 minutes to fluff. Great overall!

This was so good and easy to make! I don't know what condensed chicken broth is, nor does the supermarket have it, so I made the rice with regular chicken broth, and it all turned out yummy. Don't leave it in the oven more than 5 min because the tortillas will be too crispy.

I made just the rice - good rice, tad bit dry, was excellent if you dip  your fork in just a little sour cream with each bite.
