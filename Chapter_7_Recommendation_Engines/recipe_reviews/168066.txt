I had my doubts about this recipe; but my husband thought it looked good so I tried it.  I doubled the recipe and made it for a very small group of people.  I didn't have any leftovers to bring home!  Even what didn't get eaten, people scooped up and took with them.  I highly recommend making the sauce to go with these -- it's excellent.  Make it the night before so the flavors blend more before serving.

The one change I made to the recipe as written was that I added some grated Parmesan to the crab/shrimp balls in addition to the coating mix.

These were good.  If you're going to make them without the sauce I wouldn't bother, the sauce is what makes these so delicious.  I used imitation crab and would recommend this.  Also this recipe is so much easier with a food processor.  I put the raw shrimp and crab in it and it worked great.  I will make these again.

The taste was good, but the filler/shrimp and crab ratio was off to me. If spending the money on seafood, I to taste the seafood, not a lot of fillers. If I try again, I will double or triple the amount of shrimp and crab in the dish.
The cilantro sauce was very tasty!

Wishing I had a food processor. I sub'd imitation crab, regular mayo and rice chex. My balls never browned in the oven, not sure if it was due to the change in cereal?? After 18 minutes, threw them in a pan with light olive oil and crispied them right up. Everyone thought that sauce was ok, I don't care for mustard and  it was a little mustardy for my taste.
