Very good! I'm a little confused by the reviewer that thinks Columbians overdo cumin - I can't see how this dish could be called 'Columbian' without it. A bonus to this recipe is the excellent broth you are left with - I see soup in my future. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I have had this saved for a while now, I finally got the chance to make it this weekend.  I doubled the recipe to feed 10.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great, for the little taste I got!  They scarfed (is this a word?) it down and only left me a few shreds to try, since I was cooking tortillas for them.  The little shreds I tried were awesome tho!  Also, didnt even get a pic, next time I will.  This must be a keeper if its gone that fast.  I served it with re-fry beans, mexican rice and tortillas.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I never write reveiws for the recipes I use, but this was a huge hit for the WHOLE family! The first night I made it I realized at the last minute I had no cummin. So I cooked it without, which resulted in swiss steak (very good too) Now I am cooking it with the cumin, a beer, I added more garlic, and colorful bell peppers, and a little extra cummin. I had to make enough to feed my extended family too because they thought it looked so YUMMY! Kudos to wifeyluvs2cook! Even the Cuban at my work LOVED this and said it definetly needs the cummin to set off the sweetness! KEEPER!

My family really raved about this one. It was delicious. I would definitely try it in the slow cooker or possibly give it another half an hour of simmer time, because mine could have been just a tiny bit more tender. I made homemade pico and rice and beans with this...it was a huge hit in my house!

this was really good, I added a little more salt when I seared for the meat and whem i put all the tomatoes, and no cumin cause I personaly dont like it. I just added some garlic powder and some paprika. I cooked for two hours, and chopped the tomatoes really small.  I also cooked it with half water and have a beer, it was soooooo good.  nice and juicy and flavorful. thank you!

This is a great recipe.  Serve it with rice and plantains to get the real Colombian experience. Authentic Colombian dishes are not served with pico de gallo, sour cream and tortillas, leave those for Mexican dishes.

I absolutely loved this.  I simmered for about 2 1/2 hours.  I served over Mexican rice.  The next day I simmered the leftover steak (I used 6 big steaks) and rice together and served inside steamed tortillas.   We liked it even better the 2nd time around.  Nice change for steak.

This was OK, next time I might use a different cut of meat. Mine wasn't as tender as everyone else stated in their review.

What an easy and tasty recipe!  Followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used a yellow onion, 2 tsp of cumin (as per other reviewers) and cooked in the slow cooker 7 hours on low.  Will definitely make regularly.  Thanks for sharing.

Comfort food at its best!  I’m not Colombian nor have I tasted a lot of Colombian dishes, but I do know a good stewed steak (or Swiss steak) when I taste one.  My original plan was to have shredded beef tacos, but once I tasted it, I knew I had to go for the old fashioned meat and potatoes style dinner. As a last minute change of plans, I decided to pair it up with “Cilantro and Garlic Potatoes” (recipe from this site).

WOW Ms. Wifey! This was VERY good!!! I've tried many shredded beef recipes on here and none of them floated my or my hubs' boat - until now. :) Other than my hubs commenting about the mild, subtle flavor, we both thoroughly enjoyed this! My hubs added some fresh salsa to his meat, but I ate mine plain (with some of the yummy tomato, onion and garlic on top!). As Wifey did, I also served my stewed meat with (white) corn tortillas, avocado slices and refried beans (sprinkled with queso fresco... yum!). To appease my beans-hating husband, I also made some Mexican rice to serve on the side. I was afraid that my steak would be tough even after the suggested 2 hour cooking timeframe (I checked after an hour and was worried), but it shredded BEAUTIFULLY! My neighbor stopped by to visit and had a taco herself. All of us couldn't BELIEVE how good this was. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Wifeyluvs2cook! You made me look like a rock star. If only my neighbor knew how easy this was to throw together.... Ha! :-)

Good recipe. I added jalapeño pepper and I used beer with water. Pretty good flavor. ***UPDATE***Yesterday I made this recipe for the second time and I want to change my rating. I don't eat meat, so made this for my parents and they were really delighted (I wonder, why they did't say it for the first time, maybe, I did something wrong). I used jalapeño and beer. The meat had so much flavor. Very easy and cheap recipe with so good result.

I thought this was excellent.  The flavor was great.  I wish I had had more time to cook it, I stopped at just 2 hours.  Next time I will try the crock pot.  It was still a little bit tough.  It's a keeper!

I made this in a crockpot (on high for 4 hours) and it was good, but not great.  The meat was tender but the flavor was ok at best.  I would make this again in a pinch.

Good recipe. Only one but: We, Colombians, suffer from "cuminitis". We like to put cumin on everything. It is not necessary on this recipe.

This was good. The only thing I would suggest ist to soak the shredded beef in the tomato mixture for a few minutes to soak in that flavor. Thanks!

I loved the ease of this recipe and the delicious flavor.  That said, both my husband and I had difficulty eating the meat because it was difficult to chew.  I cooked it for 2 hours and the meat shredded easily so I'm not sure what I did wrong.  When I reheat the leftovers I will cook it longer and hope that the meat is more tender.  Other than that, we loved it.

We liked this-the long stewing process made the flank steak very tender and flavorful.  I served it over rice with a side of black beans.

Pretty good flavor... however there was too much liquid.  Because the tomatoes give off so much liquid already, I think the water amount is too much.  But it was still tasted good and the meat was pretty tender.

I must admit that I didn't have beef boullion (the store was out) so I tried to substitute with beef broth and it didn't work out.  I'm not sure if this was the only reason we weren't huge fans, but my husband and I felt like it was missing something.  It definitely needed more flavoring, I will try to add more if I make this again.
