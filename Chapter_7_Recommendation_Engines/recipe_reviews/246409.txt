7.20.16  Just one thing that you should be aware of if youâ€™re using roasted red peppers out of a jar instead of roasting a fresh red pepper.  The jarred peppers are wet, and even though you dry them as thoroughly as you can, they still will thin out your aioli...I just added more mayonnaise and adjusted the other seasons accordingly.  This has a nice blend of flavors, and was very good today on a grilled Asian turkey burger.

Super Yummy! Just as good as a high end burger joint. Would have used a tige less salt, but hubbie loved it!

OMG this is great! I bought prepared roasted red peppers at the store and used them otherwise followed the recipe. It was great. Had it with Air Fryer Chicken Wings for dinner.

Yum and simple. As I used a jar of roasted red peppers so I used lemon peel instead of juice to reduce excess liquids.

I made this according to the recipe.  I roasted my own peppers and used fresh ingredients.  It was delicious.  We served with filet and the next day, used with sandwiches using leftover beef.
