I like the idea of chocolate chai, but I found that the chocolate overpowers the tea and it just ends up tasting like spiced hot chocolate. Next time I will definitely adjust the amount of cocoa powder.

I don't know that I think chai when I taste this, but it makes a great cup of hot cocoa. I topped it with whipped cream. I thought it tasted as good as any hot chocolate drink from a coffee shop. I liked that it did not use packet hot cocoa, like other similar recipes. I just did 1 serving in the microwave. I boiled the water and seeped one bag. I then followed with 1/2 of the rest of the ingredients, to make one serving, heating in the microwave as needed. I may try it next time with Truvia. TY

pretty good! I agree that the amount of cocoa should be reduced a bit. I ended up using 2 teaspoons of cocoa instead of tablespoon without realizing that i read it wrong, and that was still a good amount of chocolate. I added more tea and less milk and its quite yummy. I shall be making this again!

I have made this so many times...I've lost count. Love Love Love. I made this for 8 teens the other day and they kept asking for more. The only change I sometimes make to it is that I add more water less milk. I make sure its half water half milk so that I get a stronger tea flavor.

This is basically hot chocolate with a hint of chai tea. I used a bag of chai tea and thought I wouldn't need all the other ingredients. Perhaps that's why mine came out lacking in flavor. I will continue to use the chai tea bag and increase the water, but decrease the amount of cocoa.

Made this today for Halloween for my husband and me. We both loved it. Put a dollop of whipped cream on top. I am a huge lover of chai drinks. Starbucks has nothing over this one! Some think it is too chocolatey. Chocolate is the most healthful ingredient in it, so I like the full amount. I wondered if it was too much spice, but I thought it was just right.

It's far too strong on the nutmeg and it tastes more like spicy hot chocolate than chai tea.

It was pretty good though I did put too much nutmeg for my taste. I'll know better for next time!
