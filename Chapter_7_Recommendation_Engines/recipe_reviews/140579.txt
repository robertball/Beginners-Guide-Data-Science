Wow! This definitely is some of the "best bacon-tomato dip" I've ever tasted! And, what it lacks in appearance it most certianly makes up for in flavor! I used light cream cheese, light mayo, reduced fat sour cream, and light Cheddar cheese along with green onions, smoked bacon and a handful of cherry tomatoes that I diced up. I let this set overnight to let the flavors blend together and served it topped with additional cheddar cheese and green onion on top! It went great with a variety of triscuit crackers, cut up celery, carrot sticks, and chips! It was gone in no time at all.......

This was well received by those in the family usually unwilling to deviate from the old familiar standbys. I have to say that I ate enough of this great stuff too-- with Ruffles potato chips! As others did, I also used green onion, as it provided color as well as a little milder flavor than chopped, regular onion would. I did cut back just a bit on the amount of onion called for as I knew that as it stood the flavor would become more intense. I know this will become a new favorite!

I made this as a quick after school snack for the kids.  I used onion powder in place of the chopped onions and added 1 teaspoon of dried ranch dressing mix. I served with crackers, tortilla chips, carrots and celery.  It was a hit!

This was good, but I felt it was missing somehting.  So I added, black pepper, green onion & garlic.  It was much better with the additions.  I will make this again. It was a hit.

Bacon, cream cheese, onions...what's not to love in this recipe? It is delicious! I used green onions instead of white.

Bye bye onion dip! This is my new favorite dip recipe. I also used scallions and added salt and pepper. Perfect! Thanks so much for sharing.

This dip was delicious.  It tasted like a bacon and tomato sandwich, but better.  I also used green onions instead of a regular onion.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sure I'll be making this one again.  Thanks.

The guests I served this to really loved it. I have to confess that I didn't bother to deseed the tomato. My husband isn't a fan of raw onion so I used chives instead. This will get many more outings I'm sure. Many Thanks.

Everybody loves this dip!  I always get compliments when I make it.  I double the batch-  makes a ton but it's worth it.  Definitely use green onions, and a couple dashes of garlic powder.

This ended up being very tasty, but I added garlic, onion powder, cracked black pepper and ranch dip mix.  I added more bacon than called for and would add even more next time.  It ended up being very tasty, but it would have been bland without the additions.

This is pretty good. I think substituting the onions for scallions (white and green parts) makes for a better dip. i've learned it's ok not to add the mayonnaise to this. The sour cream and the cream cheese is actually enough. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. It makes it easier to blend in.

I used two very large tomatoes and a whole pound of thick sliced, hickory smoked bacon. I used reduced fat sour cream/mayonnaise/cream cheese. I also added a little Frank's Hot Sauce and some fresh ground pepper. We liked this very much. I served it with Wheat Thins. Next time, I might double the cheese. My boys liked it, but I don't think they thought it was the best.

This is an awesome recipe! Had this at a party and everyone raved about how good it was. Instead of the tomato though, it had a can of Rotel tomatoes, drained. So good!! I'm making this for a Fourth of July party.

This dip is good but needs a little tweaking to make it better.  I used green onions, added more bacon, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

This was amazing and there is not a drop left! Brought this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I did use low fat mayo, sour cream and cream cheese....and I used green onions as my onion of choice....also upped the bacon to 1/2 lb. crispy and chopped......also added some fresh cracked pepper and some garlic powder.  I made this 24 hours in advance and the flavors were so very good. Served with Fritos Scoops and Keebler Sea Salt and Olive Oil Crisps....Delicious!

Made recipe as is and is good. Next time will try the ranch packet to add a little zip. Everybody liked and I served with pita chips. Next time I'll also bring the dip  to room temp as the dip was a little hard and kept breaking the pita chips. I thought at room temp it would be a little easier to dip in. Thanks for a great appitizer that was a little different from the same things I always make.

I thought the dip was only ok. I wound up altering it to my liking. I used probably twice as much (red) onion than suggested; also added some onion powder, salt & pepper as someone else suggested. With the changes, I give it 4 stars. A dash of liquid smoke doesn't hurt either. :)

My husband was eating this with a spoon all by its self… This dip was awesome!  Made it just as the directions said and it was wonderful.  Even better the next day.  I used it with fresh veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, bell pepper and cucumber).  Thank you!

My Husband loved this dip and has requested that I make it a few times (he never gets excited about food).  I made as written - only using green onion instead of white - he call's it the BLT dip.  yummmmm

Everyone (especially the men at my party) enjoyed this. I added a Hidden Valley Rach packet to the dip & this really gave it a great flavor. I also served it with a crusty French bread. It has been requested again.

Eh, this was ok, seemed pretty common.  I was expecting a spectacular dip, but it was like any other one there.  I have to say however, that it did go over well at my party.  I served ritz with it, you may want to consider something different to help spruce things up... otherwise it's really nothing special, common.

Tasty! After reading the other reviews, I added green onions, salt and pepper to this recipe, and still found it a tiny bit bland for my tastes. Next time maybe I'll try some garlic, but there will definitely be a next time. This recipe is a keeper.

Took this dip to work and everyone loved it.  People I hardly knew were asking me for the recipe.  Tastes like a old-fashioned BLT.  So easy.

AMAZING!!  I made this recipe and followed the suggestion of using chopped green onions. This was the first time making this and it was a hit...none was left and everyone asked for the recipe!  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing. :)

I doubled the bacon, and 1 tomato???  3 or 4 Roma's minus seeds.  DELISH !!!!   I also couldn't fit it all in my bowl, so I added a little Jalapeno to the extra for the spicy lovers.  They loved it !!

I substituted the 1/4 c chopped onion with two green onions because I like the flavor better when cream cheese is involved:)  I didn't add the chopped tomato until just before serving to ensure the dip wouldn't get watery.  BIIIG hit!!!

08-06-16 ~ Very good dip that presents well with crackers, tortilla chips, fresh cut veggies or a topping for a baked potato. I made as written and it is very good. We felt that it could use a little seasoning with season salt or a little garlic powder. I would make this dip again.

We all loved this dip at the party!  However I did tweek it s little to fit some dietary requirements. It easily doubles (it was a big party) and I omitted the onions and tomatoes but added two cups of shredded sharp cheddar.  Yum.  I tried the leftovers on a fried egg samich and a baked potato OMG good!!!

Made this recipe exactly as posted & it turned out awesome! To be honest, I'm not rating this 5 stars based on flavor alone, IMO it's 4 stars for flavor but, IMHO, I find it worthy of another star because it is incredibly easy to make with items I always have on hand. I used a vine-ripened tomato from our garden . Also, it tasted "just okay" when it was first made, but after chilling for 3 hours the flavors blended nicely, so now this is my go-to last-minute fave dip recipe that I can throw together rather easily with items I always have on hand.

This is a great base recipe.  I find that it was a bit on the plain side (great for picky eaters or children that just can't handle anything spicy).  I added a bit more onion, some garlic, salt, sour cream, and extra cayenne pepper and omitted the mayo: it was a huge hit at my last party.

I'm not big on ranch dressing, so I didn't want to do as others suggested, so I bought ranch-flavored potato chips for the dipper.  I felt a little of this dip goes a long way, and my BF, who is a big bacon lover didn't care for it. I love all the ingredients so I can't figure out what's wrong with it! I'm going to buy some corn chips and see if that helps.
