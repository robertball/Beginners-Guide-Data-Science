Wow--Five stars with the following changes: 1/2 cup each brown & white sugar instead of the 2/3 cup. Instead of the hot water, use very hot HALF & HALF with 2 teaspoons vanilla. This gives a MUCH creamier pudding and won't taste like a cake of flour and water, like some have said of this type of recipe. I've made it both ways and I can't believe how much better the recipe with half and half is!!! Why has no one published a recipe like this?!!! :-)

Lord have mercy, this is the most glorious concoction in the world. I baked it in a 9 inch cake pan, and  subbed half the white sugar with splenda. I baked it for 33 minutes, and allowed it to sit for half an hour before serving. The wait time is important because it allows the syrup to thicken and the cake to become brownie like. THIS IS AMAZING, it is easy and delicious and sure to become a family favorite.

Made it for a dieting friend, so substituted low fat soy milk for milk, and applesauce instead of oil. Still came out SOOOO delicious!

EXCELLENT! I just finished my first taste of this cake and it's awesome. It's almost like a brownie on top and a warm chocolate sauce on the bottom. I didn't have miniature milk chocolate chips so I used the regular size and that worked just fine. It is VERY rich and chocolaty and would be great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to help cut that a little bit. I did cook it for longer than the time specified, probably an extra 10 minutes. I kept an eye on it until it looked fairly dry on top. I let it cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes and then dug in! I will definitely be adding this to my recipe collection and thanks for an easy recipe using most things you already have on hand!

SO EASY AND SINFULLY DELICIOUS!!!! This wonderful cake is worth all the calories!!  I did decrease the brown and white sugar to half a cup each.  I also increased the chocolate chips to l/2 cup, using regular size chips since I didn't have the mini size. The chocolate chips add additional flavor and texture, and would consider them a must in this recipe! The perfect recipe for last minute company.  Thanks for sharing.

This pudding is so yummy!  I have been making the same thing for quite a while; I don't remember where I got the recipe from.  The only differences between my recipe and this are no chocolate chips (but I think those would be good) and adding 2 teaspoons instant coffee to the hot water.  I think that would make the difference for those people who said the pudding part was too bland/watery.
And the person who rated this poorly because they didn't bake it long enough, come on now.  Bake times are always estimates.  Don't give something a poor rating because you didn't bake it right.

After a recent dinner out my husband became obsessed with the chocolate pudding cake we had for dessert. So I thought I'd see if I could make it at home. I must admit I was a little skeptical of how this would turn out when I decided to give it a go.  My skepticism was all for naught! This is a FABULOUS dessert! It's so easy, and so good there is no reason not to make this every single day!!! ;) Seriously though, my husband was floored. He told me that mine was better than restaurant version! He was very happy! I made it for a recent get together and the hostess asked if I had gotten it at a local bakery that always has huge lines. She was shocked that this wonderful dessert came from my own kitchen! She said "It seems like it would be SO complicated!" Little does she know it's a SNAP!! Seriously folks, if you want to please and delight the chocolate lovers in your life, make them this chocolate pudding cake! They will thank you! As for the recipe, I also did a 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar instead of the 2/3 cup. The cake was plenty sweet and very decadent. I baked it for 30 minutes and let it set for about 20 minutes more. It was warm and gooey and amazing! LOVE THIS!!

What a hit! Although this looked weird, once baked and served hot with vanilla ice cream, it made a fabulous dessert. Just two suggestions. Firstly, I followed reviewers' advice and cut the white sugar by 1/2 a cup - no more is needed. Second, although the texture is perfect, the flavor is a bit bland. I think I'd add some maple, mint or almond extract along with the vanilla next time. Thanks for a winner!

This is EXCELLANT!  I have reduced the sugar a bit at times and it does not affect the flavor at all.  I have also used part Spenda and part sugar

Divine chocolate pudding cake! Aside from measuring cups and spoons, all you dirty up is a whisk to mix, and the pan you bake in! I made a small addition to the ingredients. Instead of 1 1/4 cup hot water, I microwaved 1 1/4 cup of whole milk (about 1:30 minutes depending on microwave wattage) and then added 3 tablespoons espresso powder to the hot milk + the vanilla. The espresso brings out the chocolate taste MUCH more, and the milk gives the "pudding" a creamier, silky texture. DELICIOUS!

This was sooooo good.  I messed it up as I was making it and it still tasted fabulous.  Didn't read the recipe all the way through and added all the cocoa powder at once, so I just added a 1/4 more at the end.  Also subbed some half and half and water for the water. It made it rich and creamy like a real pudding bottom. Let it sit for about 30 minutes before eating too. I think this helped the sauce thicken up. Had it with some coffee ice cream.  It was bliss!!

This recipe was a great big flop. I am a pretty good cook and make chocolate cakes and frosting from scratch often so I certainly know how to follow a recipe. I did everything right with this recipe, even subbed half&half for the water to improve taste per all the reviews. It was dry and not very chocolatey tasting. It resembled nothing close to pudding -- bread pudding or otherwise. I was utterly disappointed in every way with this recipe. I planned to make this cake for everyone over the 4th weekend but time got away from us. THANK GOODNESS because this recipe would have embarrassed me with its failing flavor and texture. Sorry -- just not a keeper.

I doubled this for a 9x13 pan, but reduced the sugar like others. I left out the chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand & it was still plenty sweet and chocolate-y! I did use all milk rather than the water on top to make sure it was nice and creamy, which it was! It reminded me of hot chocolate. My whole family loved this, I'm sure ill be making this all the time. Thanks!

This was great!  So easy and did not require a ton of time to time or dishes to clean up!   Next time I am going to add a teas. of coffee to the hot water...well actually I might just use hot milk instead.  Oh, I did sprinkle a little coconut  -which I love.

This was excellent - though I do recommend when it comes out of the oven to cover it and let it sit for a day.  Neither of my kids liked it fresh from the oven, but after it sat in the kitchen for a day they couldn't get enough of it.  Made one last week and just made another last night.  Delicious!

Really good for a pudding cake. I simplified it even more, just mixed all the cocoa into the flour, then dissolved the brown sugar into boiling water (our brown sugar here tends to be lumpy) and poured it over the top of the batter.  Took everyone's advice and reduced the sugar -- glad I did.

I just made this in an 8 inch round cake pan and it was delicious! Most of the time I hate chocolate but there are some rare odd times when I absolutely crave it, had one of those this morning so upon browsing this site came across this recipe. Already had all the ingredients on hand so decided to try it. I have no clue how the liquid mixture sinks down to the bottom upon baking but it somehow does and mine came out to be a liquid (kind of a cross between a syrup and a pudding) chocolaty amazing concoction on the bottom and a divine brownie on top. Anyway make sure that you do not stir the liquid in after pouring it on top as you're not supposed to. Just take it straight to the oven after pouring the water on top. The only things that I really changed was added some almond extract in with the vanilla extract in the hot water, and I only had like a half of a handful of Chocolate Chunks from the last time I made CC Cookies so not thinking that was enough for me, I took 8 melting centers hershey's kisses and put that on top along with the brown sugar/coca powder mixture. The only change I made other than these slight changes was I decreased the brown sugar TO 1/2 of a cup. It's plenty sweet like that, in fact I might decrease the white sugar to that amount next time as well. Would be perfect with vanilla ice cream although I only had mine with whipped cream this first time. Now excuse me while I go get myself another bowl of this deliciousness!!

This was DELICIOUS. I also did 1/2c. each of white and brown sugar...but other than that I followed the recipe and got rave reviews from everyone - including my friend who had requested a low-cholesterol dessert.    The only thing I'd add to this is some vanilla ice cream on the side because holy cow this is ONE rich dessert! Very molten lava cake'ish! Looks SO weird going into the oven, but WOW it looked/tasted great afterwards. Will absolutely make again!

I liked this because I have so much cocoa powder in my pantry and needed something sweet. My husband wasn't a big fan, but he doesn't have a huge appetite for sweets.

Great dessert. Gooey and wonderful. It could be a little more flavorful though. My husband added too much cocoa powder on accident and it made it even more tasty. Great dessert that serves a lot of people. Or just a lot of leftevers for yourself :)

I went by some other reviews, using 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Used half and half instead of water and baked for 30 minutes.  It did look a little "jiggly" when I took it out but I thought it would set up after a while. 30 minutes later I spooned some into a bowl. I love creamy, gooey chocolatey desserts but this was like spooning cake batter into a bowl. I put it back n the oven for another 10 minutes or so and it was better but still not quite right, consistency wise. May try again following the recipe exactly but I'm not too impressed so far.  Thank you anyway.

O-M-G...HEAVEN in a baking dish!!! I used half white and half brown sugar in the mix (very sweet so will reduce the sugar by a few TBL next time), unsweet chocolate almond milk in place of milk, and 3Tbl Earth Balance butter in place of oil. I also used half plain soy milk and half water in place of water, didn't put any chocolate chips on top because I didn't have any, and only used half brown sugar on top. This was good warm and DIVINE cold. Next time I will use some dark chocolate chips or carob chips on top but then I would need to add like 3 more stars I'm sure, I don't know how this could get any better!!

Yummy, but make sure you divide the cocoa powder 1/4 for cake and 1/4 for sauce I was in a hurry and forgot and added all the cocoa to the cake part, and then had to add an extra 1/4 for the pudding part.  Even with my mistakes it was awesome and extra chocolaty :)

My mom used to make one similar when I was a kid and I had lost my recipe. I think she may have had a little cinnamon in hers. This is wonderful as is. Both times I have used Hersheys 
Special Dark baking cocoa. Super yum! Thanks for postiing

Just as fantastic as everyone says plus fat free yippee! I wanted to add that I've scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and cooked it in a large microwavable mug around 1- 1.5 minutes I think? Use a deep mug because it will rise up and bubble and use a toothpick to check done-ness but it's worked for me several times and it's much better than the microwave chocolate mug cake! Be sure to let it sit a bit afterwards because it's super hot. Also it's the perfect serving size when it's just my boyfriend and I.

This was really yummy and chocolatey! I followed the suggestion of using 1/2 cup each of brown & white sugar. Served with whipped cream, would also be great with vanilla ice cream! I dont know how it could make 16 servings, I only got about 6-7 out of it! Either you are only supposed to serve a few spoonfuls or I served enough to give my guests a heartattack!! Next Im going to try Hershey's Hot Fudge Pudding Cake and see how the two recipes compare

This is soooooo good!!!!   I listened to what a reviewer had to say, and used half and half cream.  It was good dont get me wrong, but i felt as though it was too thick.  Next time i will try just regular milk, as opposed to water on the top.

This cake is to die for!!  Super easy to make and just decadent!  It looks kinda funky when it comes out, but it is awesome!  It really does come together quickly.  I didn't think it would, but I mixed up quick and it baked while we ate and was cool enough to eat once we were ready for dessert.  Awesome with ice cream!

This was yummy! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I think it was a tad bland. Next time I will jazz it up by using a different flavor of extract. Maybe rum extract.. or peppermint. Overall - definitely a keeper!

I made this twice today to test out a few variations.  With the first one, I replaced the hot water with coffee and added some cinnamon to the brown sugar mixture, and with the second one, I replaced two tbsp of the flour with cocoa and added chopped walnuts to the mix.  Both were delicious!  I gave this recipe four stars because as written, it's a tad bland and because it didn't quite satisfy an ardent sweet tooth/chocoholic/cake addict like me - but when you want something quick and simple, this is a great choice!

My boyfriend loves pudding and he loved this cake so much!!! Our whole house still smells like it and the suggestion of ice cream with it made it even better. It tasted like a 5 star restaurant quality molten chocolate cake but even better, I'll be making this again that;s for sure.

Great, and thanks for providing a recipe that does not use a mix. I live in Kathmandu Nepal and don't have or want to use mixes. This pudding cake was great, made with milk and the reduced sugar as discussed by many.

Yum! I have been looking for ages for the low fat version of my dad's favorite Denver Pudding, and this is it.  As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 brown and white, cut the oil by half, and upped the vanilla and cocoa slightly.  Came out great, just make sure use a deepish baking dish because I ended up with chocolate sauce splattered all over the oven.

I needed a dessert to take to a church dinner and didn't want to have to go out to the store for anything.  This fit the bill, and I'm so glad I tried it.  Nice and chocolatey, and nice and gooey, with easy one-dish preparation as well.  The only problem with taking it to a church dinner is that I heard several comments that it wasn't cooked.  Maybe better to serve to a smaller group where you can explain what it is.

This recipe was so easy my 3 year old helped me make it.  A wonderfull weeknight dessert when you want something rich and quick.  Excellent served with cool whip topping.  I also reduced slightly on the sugar(about less 2 tbsp for each kind of sugar)and it was still wonderfull.

I noticed the photo posted is of individual cupcakes, which according to the reviewer did NOT work out, so follow the instructions! This was amazing! My husband licked his bowl! Had it warm with vanilla ice cream. I was looking for a recipe for what we call in the UK chocolate sponge pudding and this was the closest I could find. I will be making this one at my next dinner party for sure! I cooked it for about 30 minutes in a fan assisted oven.

Quite good & VERY fast!  For best results use a good quality cocoa, serve WARM & w/vanilla ice cream. The sauce is very gooey but blends particularly well w/the ice cream. NOTE: I don't use the brown sugar. I use regular cane sugar and blend it w/ 2 teaspoons of molasses.

GREAT!  I did not have chocolate chips and I do not think it hurt the recipe.  I added chopped walnuts and increased the cooking time by 10 minutes.  My lord, it is rich and meant for chocolate lovers!  I was looking for an eggless cake recipe and came on this. Sent to my sister and I will definitely make this again.

Skimming through the recipe, I accidentally put all the cocoa into the main mixture. So then I had to add more for the topping.
It turned out so deliciously rich and chocolatey! I loved the addition of chocolate chips to the topping. It was a real special triple chocolate treat. I'd probably do it the same way again next time!

Yummy and easy to make. I divided it between 6 ramakins to dress it up a bit. I will try reducing suger as others posted, just to cut calories because I'll be eating more than I really should. :-)  You won't regret trying this one.

I used 1/3 cup of organic can sugar in place of the 2/3 cup of brown sugar, and then drizzled it with a couple Tbsp of fancy molasses before sprinkling with chocolate chips and chunks. It was sensational :)

There is absolutely no need to replace the water with half and half cream. That would be total overkill!

Wonderful! I also only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used milk instead of water.  I overcooked slightly the first time because I was worried it wasn't cooked enough, but it does continue to cook once out of the oven and will dry up the "pudding" if you overcook.

This was so yummy!  Especially with vanilla ice cream on top.  I will say that this recipe serves about 8 small portions, not nearly 16 as shown.  It was even better the next day heated up so don't be afraid to make it a day ahead!

Since I don't bake often, I liked the idea of this cake. I thought it was a little strange when I first scooped it out into a bowl but I did enjoy the taste. It wasn't so overpoweringly sweet. (I don't really like much sweets, I make them for the kids) I managed to eat a whole bowl of this. It was rather addicting. My kids loved it.

Very very easy, and delicious just as written! The 1/2 cup of cocoa makes this deeply chocolate, and THAT makes it absolutely perfect with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream! The ultimate hot fudge sundae!

Delicious! Had a taste for a sweet but was not going to write a review as I did not have a full 1/2 cup of cocoa and had no chocolate chips on hand. Made it to satisfy my sweet tooth and it was great! Let it sit for 20 min and it made a wonderful pudding on the bottom.  Next time I will use the chips for more chocolate flavor. Surprisingly low calorie for a desert which is an added bonus.

This was a big hit with my family. It was incredibly rich and delicious, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Don't skimp on the water or you won't have enough sauce to spoon over everything! I loved that this was a one-dish dessert that could bake during dinner so it was warm and ready afterwards. Yum!

Very good.  Easy and fast, too.  I used 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and reduced the white sugar a little.  Also used 1% milk.  I used milk choco chips, and probably used 1/2 cup (wanted to use them up).  Very rich and chocolaty- my 4 year old said it was "too chocolaty!!"  :)  It's nice that it's lower in fat than most desserts... but I made up for that fact by serving it with some vanilla ice cream!

I prefer this dessert after it has cooled to room temperature. It gets a rich pudding like taste and the chocolate chips add additional goodness.

WOW!  What sinful goodness!  I was apprehensive about mixing something in the pan, but WOW!!!  I can't say enough how WONDERFUL this recipe was!  I used cinnamon chips left over from cookies, and it gave it a delicate spiciness.  I can see using all sorts of different chips to change it up.  So yummy!  Will DEFINATELY make this again.

What an awesome recipe! I made it using mint chocolate chips and peppermint extract, and served it with candy cane ice cream (since it's Christmas). Can't wait to try it with raspberry chocolate chips and fresh raspberries with whipped cream in the summer.

So delicious. Didn't use the chocolate chips - didn't need it! I scooped out each serving of the cake, topped with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and then scooped out the fudge sauce that is created at the bottom of the pan and drizzled it over it all. Incredible dessert, incredibly easy. Made it with my 4yr-old.

This was delicous and sooooo easy! I love that it was made in the same pan that it was baked in and turned out perfectly. Next time I think I will leave out the chocolate chips though because it was almost too chocolatey (who new that was possible?). We ate it with whipped cream but it would be really good with some vanilla ice cream.

If there was a possibility to give this six stars, I would.  This is a FANTASTIC recipe using pantry ingredients and only one pan/bowl to make it in.  I only use Dutch-processed cocoa (I find the other stuff to be bitter), had a generous hand with the vanilla, and used the large chocolate chips.  I did use the extra 10 min. someone else recommended.  I served it at a Super Bowl party with some French vanilla ice cream and candied pecans and everybody RAVED.  It was gone in no time.  Nobody considered the strawberry shortcake.  If you love hot fudge sundaes, this recipe IS A MUST!!!

This is a delicious pudding cake.  I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 2/3 c. brown sugar. Also added 2 tsp. instant coffee with the vanilla to the hot water. I made a pudding cake years ago that boiled over so I put my 9" pan on a cookie sheet just in case. It didn't even come close to boiling over. I baked it for 29 min....turned out delish(or did I already say that?)

I agree with reducing the sugars to 1/2c. each.  I also replaced the hot water with strong coffee! And the chocolate chips with regular sized tri-color chips (white, milk and dark).
It turned out delicious! would definitely recommend the coffee substitution!

This is so easy to make and so versatile.  The first time I made it, I made true to this recipe.  Now we throw in peanut butter or butterscotch  chips, I sometimes don't use any chips.  I've thrown in toasted coconut, roasted and chopped pecans.  The 2 things I always do now is use butter instead of oil and milk instead of water.  Go out on a limb and put instant espresso in the hot milk before pouring over the cake mix.  It adds a LOADS of flavor and richness.  Great recipe and super easy

Substituted instant unsweetened vanilla pudding mix for the 1/4 cup cocoa in the dry ingredients, and increases the milk to 170 ml. In the last step, added the vanilla extract to hot milk instead of to water. Increased baking time to 55 mins.  Will make this many more times!

I made suggested adaptations: 1/2 cup of sugars (I use Truvia Baking Blend sugars) and  used almond  milk instead of water. 

My guests raved about this. Easy to make. Topped with fresh whipped cream - perfect!

Wonderful and super easy to make. The adjustment I would make is both brown and white sugar to 1/2 cup.

This is a recipe that my Mom made for me as a child in the 1960's.  It was part of a recipe collection in a Betty Crocker cookbook binder that she purchased in the 1950's.  I was always fascinated how the hot water changed to pudding in the oven.  If I remember correctly, the only difference in the recipe was that butter was used rather than oil and cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips. This is a great recipe, and adapts well to so many variations.

My family loved it despite my little blunder!!  The only thing I would change is to have the two cocoa amounts split because of course I put a half cup in the batter mix so then put none on top.  Still tasted good though!

We really enjoyed this topped with vanilla bean slow churned ice cream. Very easy to make. You mix it in the same pan you bake it in & you don't even grease the pan. There are no eggs in it so its okay to eat it not cooked all the way through. This recipe made 5 or 6 servings.

Oh boy, this is heaven for a chocoholic! Followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of a few teaspoons of Maxwell House International Cafe Vienna instant coffee powder stirred into the water. I served it with coffee ice cream...oh boy, this is heaven for a coffeeholic too! I'm so glad I tried this recipe, I was hesitant at first because I've tried a similar recipe using biscuit mix that wasn't that great. This recipe though will DEFINITELY be used quite a bit in my house! I love the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand AND you make it in the pan you bake it in AND it's quick to put together! Can't wait to try this again, maybe with a different coffee flavor and chips, french vanilla coffee and white chocolate chips perhaps? Thanks so much for the recipe, a definite keeper! :)

It's been years since I made this, every bit as good as I remember it! I read a review here describing difficulty in transferring the batter to the pan. DON'T TRANSFER - mix up all the ingredients in the baking pan and pour the boiling water over the batter - very important to the final outcome. Not sure why some reviewers find this bland - wonderful chocolate gooey goodness for my taste buds. I did use milk chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chips. AWESOME!

The taste was really good, I used milk instead of water but the cake part stuck to the bottom and didn't rise at all. I wouldn't think this was because I used milk but I use to make something like this years ago and didn't have a problem. Not sure what has changed.

Quick, easy, and with ingredients usually on hand. Rich flavor.

I did substitute Stevia for the white sugar.  Did not change brown (didn't have splenda brown on hand). Followed the directions with everything else.

I've made this many times and it's always a big hit. I use half a cup of each kind of sugar. Once I mixed all the cocoa in the cake part and it still turned out great. I'm sure it would be good with half and half, but I never have any on hand and I try and keep it an inexpensive recipe. It has always been great with just water on top.

This is a great recipe as it is but if you want to kick it up substitute the hot water with hot coffee. Mix 1 egg yolk into the batter for extra creamy richness. Wip the egg white into medium stiff peaks and fold into batter then place chocolate chips on top of batter, next brown sugar, followed by hot coffee & vanilla. Bake as directed. It should rise and crisp a bit on the edges and still be gooey and delish!

Really good for my chocolate craving! I took another reviewers advice & microwaved it for about 2 mins. Then instead of vanilla to the hot water I added some instant coffee powder to make a mocha sauce.

This is the best chocolate pudding cake!!! Absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make it again and again! A couple of changes I made:  I used only 1 cup of sugar total and used brewed haselnut teeccino (coffee substitute)in place of the hot water.

Made these as cupcakes despite the problems described by the cupcake reviewer.  Used stand mixer for all ingredients except the cocoa, brown sugar, choc chips and hot water (used part water part 1/2 & 1/2).  They rose nicely and even crowned a little with a nice 'pudding' on the bottom.  The cake had an excellent texture--I was surprised by the moistness and nice crumb though they contained no eggs. I docked one star for flavor, but it's a personal preference: the taste was a bit cocoa powder-floury, and I prefer my cake a bit more chocolatey.

I was very suprised that I didn't love this cake as much as most of the reviewers as I LOVE chocolate cakes, any kind but this was just OK for me. Add ice cream on top and it goes to a 4 star but I actualy thought it was a little bland tasting

I don't know if this is also known by the name "Chocolate dump cake" because it's all made in the same pan, however, it was very easy to make and I had ingredients on hand. I did use sweetened cocoa powder and cut back on the white sugar and used Splenda brown sugar mix. Still came out great using regular choclate chips. Husband and kids loved it.

Really easy and so good. I over-cooked it the second time I made it, but it was still good, just a bit dry. Try reducing the sugar--The previous reviewers were right, it doesn't need it all.

These taste good, but they did not turn out the way I was expecting them to.  I mixed the batter in a bowl and added the water as I as mixing, since the batter was too thick to put into a pan without it.  Big mistake - the cupcakes turned out sunken in, stuck to the paper cups, with the chocolate chips at the bottom.  They were also extremely oily on the bottom.  I may try making these again, but will do everything in one pan as per the instructions.

Wow! This recipe was EXCELLENT!!! We actually made this cake using fat free or low fat ingredients, and it worked out perfect! I've made a recipe like this once, and the pudding turned out way too runny. This one did not. Definetly has a yummy rich chocolate taste to it-Satisfied my chocolate cravings! Thank you!!

My family loved this quick and easy cake.  But it's definitely not enough for twelve people.  The sauce is better with less water but still not very thick.

yum. definitely add about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla paste or essence. served warm with ice cream it is absolutely delicious!
i put 1 1/3 cup of water in the last step - and the sauce was nice and rich. wouldn't want it any thinner or thicker.

It tastes great both warm and cold. Very simple to make and you don't have to do many dishes after baking!

INCREDIBLE! I love this one kind of chocolate pudding cake from a local restaurant, but now I have this even better recipe to satisfy my chocoholic craving at home. This was awesome and so easy to make, just one dish!! An instant favorite for me, and the boyfriend. Definitely going to make this again!

This was great! A bit weird to make but so quick and the results are very nice (and oh-so-chocolatey!)! We didn't notice any scorched taste, mixed everything in the pan, just as per the instructions, made the mistake of putting the whole 1/2 cup cocoa in the mix, so I just added another 1/4 cup on top and it was still great! (Will do it right the next time though). I also didn't have any mini chips so I used regular ones. We all loved it. Next time I will make it with the children as it's so easy and fun to make, and quick!! Thanks Carol!

This was great, even better the next day.  It is a rich moist cake, with a chocolate custard underneath, almost like a variation of a molten chocolate cake.

Was kind of worried that the sauce would be too liquidy, but it wasn't - it was gooey, as another reviewer said.  Anyway, it really hit the spot.  My husband wanted to have it for dinner!  I reduced the sugar to one cup (and forgot to use brown instead of white on top) and I used regular chocolate chips.  I did notice that scorched taste another reviewer mentioned, but I kind of liked it!
