I halved the recipe for a 9x9 pan but next time I would make the whole recipe in a 9x9 pan. I used 8 thin stalks of rhubarb and no apples 40 minutes was perfect in my oven for a full recipe I would use 16 stalks of rhubarb and no apples. We really enjoyed this combination of cake and crisp!

8x8 was too small.. used a 9 x 12... delicious! Now I've made it again and used frozen currants and gooseberries (cooked down) for the fruit!

I made this and definitely needed a larger pan. I used an 8x11 pan and it was full to the brim. I added a layer of sliced strawberries between the cake batter and compote which added some nice color and natural sweetness. Next time, I would reduce the sugar, or use brown sugar in the oats mix for more color and richer flavor. Nice cake texture and simple recipe to make.

I made this because I had some cooked rhubarb in the freezer that I wanted to use. I followed the recipe but exchanged the margarine for butter for both the cake and topping. I eliminated the apples and just used the rhubarb. As others suggested I used a 9 x 12 pan and it came out perfectly. It was really good. I was somewhat hesitant about using the oats in the topping but it added a wonderful texture as well as flavour. Thanks to Samantha.

Only thing I changed was I used brown sugar  instead of white in crumb topping.  LOVED THIS CAKE.

Beware this recipe states to make in an 8 X 8 pan. I thought it seemed like a lot to fit in and sure enough it ran down the sides and into the oven while baking. Also took longer to bake. It still was good yet I believe there is an error and it should be made in a larger 9 X 13. Even a 9" square won't be large enough. The photo looks like more of a bar type dessert than a cake which I believe you would get in the larger pan. First time I didn't read the reviews before making something and I later saw another review that pan size should be upped.
