This may be helpful...Some people seem to not be familiar with a traditional English (I think the Canadians may be using this also) pudding which is more like a gooey bread ie: figgy pudding, plum pudding, black pudding etc. The creamy stuff we call pudding in the U.S. would be referred to as a custard in most places.

First off let me say this is a decent recipe. For a non-steamed pudding it was nice. Simple, relatively quick, easy and inexpensive to make. The 10 minute beating of the initial wet ingredients is, in my opinion, not necessary. 3-5 minutes fo this small amount is acceptable, as long as you have a good smooth blend. Also, if you do not have (real) maple syrup, the average maple flavoured table syrup that the vast majority of us have in the cupboard is fine, and can often be flavoured more strongly than real syrup.  As to the complaints I read... I do not feel this is a good forum for complaints. If you had issues making the recipe, tips or tweaks to make it better then by all means, but the out and out complaints and bashing are in poor taste. Especially when wrong. Being an American living in Canada, I have a broader view than some. Try and remember, the net is not confined to the US. Therefore anything you see online has a very good likelihood of being from elsewhere.  Pudding is the British verb used to generically describe dessert ("If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding, hoe can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!"). American style pudding did not become common until around the 1930's. "Traditional Pudding" would be a bread or cake like dish, more often than not sweet these days.  So, if you are going to complain, please make sure you know what you are speaking of.  Thanks for the recipe by the way!

A traditional pudding has a spongy, cake like texture; it is not the pie filling most consider pudding.  Other examples are a steamed pudding or a plum pudding or even spoon bread.  There is no need to disparage this recipe as two different types of "puddings" are being confused by the cooks. Give it a try on its own merit and broaden your culinary knowledge.  Then try a traditional steamed pudding for your holiday meal; brought to the table alight - it's stunning.

this is not the traditional "pudding" as in a smooth jello pudding texture. It is a lot more like a soft cake. it is based on a recipe in Quebec called "pudding chomeur". It is served at most restaurants here and is a very popular dessert. Why it is called pudding we will never know!

I'm thinking that this should be called Maple Syrup BREAD Pudding so that everyone will stop being confused.

A very good pudding recipe. (Puddng as in bread pudding, figgy pudding, that kind of thing, not the custard we call pudding here in the states.) Add some nuts and this gets a five star rating. It's good to learn the tastes and foods of other countries. We in the states don't have to serve just what is familiar to us. Expand your horizons. Most cooks could look at this recipe and tell it is going to be bread or cake like before they make it.

I'm confused.  It's not pudding at all, it's cake plus it was kind of dry. My family really liked it but I was dissapointed.

I agree completely, this was a CAKE! What did I do wrong? There was no surup at the bottom and it was not a pudding. I was really hoping that it would be like the desert my husband and I order at one of our favorite resturants. It's called "Chomeur pudding". It's also got maple in it, but it's definately a pudding. Better luck next time!

"Very simple and easy," indeed. I gathered from glancing at some prior reviews that this was a pudding in the English sense (dessert) and not the American one (custard). But I didn't quite know what to expect. It turned out to be a simple, yet tasty kind of cake with a pronounced, but not too strong, maple flavor. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out fine. But in my case, I think the 45 minute baking time was a little too long, as it was fairly well browned. This is nothing fancy, but I liked it well enough for three nights' desserts. Worth a try, but I'm not sure I'll be making it again.

This is not what you think of as traditional pudding but was still good. It is more cake-like. I thought it needed a little sauce so I used a Vanilla Sauce from this website on the top. I really liked the flavor.

I am an experienced baker; and try as I might, this recipe did not give me anything beyond a light-textured cake and no sauce.

I used corn syrup because maple syrup in Italy is very expensive and I use it only for pancakes! This cake is not properly a pudding, but it's more like a plum cake with a nice flavour of corn (or maple) syrup. Not too sweet, the next time I will add more sugar. I added a 1/3 cup of flour because it seemed too liquid. The corn syrup didn't sink to the bottom as written in the recipe. I prefer it cold and I think it's a good cake only for breakfast. Cooking time is ok.

I made this as a steamed pudding in a basin/steamer instead of baking it in the oven. I also placed the Maple Syrup at the bottom of a greased and lined steamer and added the batter on top. Upturn the pudding and the syrup runs down the sides. In regard to it being "a pudding" to me this is what we Brits call puddings, and I guess other Commonwealth countries the same. SamanthaAust

While delicious, it still turns out to be more of a cake than a pudding.  No drippy maple syrup at the bottom.  Delicious nonetheless.  I think mixing in chopped walnuts would be good as well.

Sorry, but this was a  disppointment... the final product turned out nothing like described. I do feel that the recipe can take on a new life with great success as a maple muffin (including walnuts perhaps, or topped with walnut, just not as a maple pudding.

Loved it!  one of the best puddings I've ever had.  I'm glad it's so simple; I can make it more often & quickly for my son.  I may experiment & replace some or all of the flour with corn meal next time.

This recipe was not what I was expecting, as far as a pudding goes.  Not sure why the directions say to beat the butter mixture for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, it was no different than if I beat it for 2 minutes. Overall, it did taste good.  Not sure if I will make it again.
