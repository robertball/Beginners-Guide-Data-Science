I just made this recipe today and absolutely love it.  Super easy!!  But I did read the reviews and then tweaked it slightly.  I put in 1 can of each....cream of celery, potato, and mushroom.  I also cut up small carrots and sprinkled with parsley for color and presentation.  I did not add any salt, even to the instant rice, due to all the salt in all the soups and it was just right.  I rubbed the tenderloin with garlic/lemon/pepper seasoning very generously.  This is a definite keeper!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe and all the "tips".  Oodles_OR

Total comfort food for a rainy Saturday afternoon.  I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, and added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and cut up red potatoes.  I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery soup.  It made for a very tasty sauce with all the veggies added.  (highly recommend you add vegetables and/or potatoes; might be bland otherwise.)

WOW, was the first word out of my husbands mouth. I used one can of cream of celery soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup along with one package of onion soup mix. I also added cut up onion, potato & baby carrots. One hour before it was finished I added whole mushrooms. It was so tasty I could hardly stop eating it!!

Love it!  Be sure to brown the roast on all sides (in a skillet on the stove works best) for just a few minutes---it makes the end-product much more appealing visually.  The gravy with this is awesome!

The roast I'm using is 2.2 pounds and I lightly seasoned (with garlic salt and pepper) and browned it on all sides in a frying pan first. I used a can of cream of celery, a can of cream of chicken, and half a package of dry onion soup mix with a cup of water - I wanted to make sure there's lots of gravy, especially with the roast being larger.  I mixed the soups, soup mix, and water together, poured it over the roast, and.... Now I'm waiting to see what happens. :) I also put a few handfuls of baby carrots in the slow cooker. My plan is to serve this over egg noodles. I'll add to my review tonight... *** I was concerned that the gravy would be too salty, but it doesn't appear to have been! The carrots turned out awesome, and the gravy was great. I thickened it with some cornstarch to give it the gravy consistency. It was so good, and the leftovers were good for a few days! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was very good. My husband really enjoyed it.  Although, I don't care too much for the celery taste.  I used 1 cane of cream of celery, and one can of cream of mushroom.  In the future I'd probably skip the celery altogether.  But, the pork was very tender and delicious!!  Will make again!

Loved this yummy and easy slow cooker recipe!  Took advice from others and added 1 can each of crm of mushroom, chicken, and potato.  Didn't use the celery at all.  The potato addition was great.  I also added baby carrots to the dish.  Husband liked it a lot too!  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe turned out really good this evening. I made sure to brown my tenderloin before placing it in the crockpot. Instead of using cream of celery soup, I used 2 cans cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I rubbed the tenderloin with garlic powder, paprika, pepper and seasoning salt before placing the soups over the top of it. It turned out so tender and the gravy was amazing! Thanks, Anita!

This pork was so tender!  I read the reviews before preparing so I was able to tweak it a little.  I added the lemon pepper rub and it helped.  I believe someone called this comfort food and that's exactly what comes to mind.  Next time I will add some veggies!

Not bad. Pork was very boring-tasting, but the gravy helped and was absolutely necessary. I used 3 cans of soup and added baby carrots. To be honest, the carrots were the best part.

I love how easy and good this recipe is.  I used two cans of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the Cream of Celery soup, and used a 3 pound Pork Loin in the crockpot.  It turned out wonderfully tender, moist, and the gravy was really good to use over rice, noodles, or potatoes.  Using the pork Loin, we had enough for over two meals for two people.   The leftovers were even better than the first time.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy to modify and make it a little different every time.  I have made it a dozen times and different each time...used different soups, seasonings, browned or not, veggies or none...each time, my family devours it.  The gravy is to die for.  For those of you who are afraid of the salt content, make sure to use low sodium soups and salt it yourself.  I always use 3 cans of soup to ensure there is plenty of gravy.

Great!  I added some herbs and minced onion to spice it up.  Tenderloin completely fell apart when I took it out of the crockpot!

Added potaotes and carrots. Used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery. Everyone loved it. Would spice it up a little. Was a tad bland. Nothing salt and pepper wouldn't fix. Great dish

This recipe was super easy and turned out really well with lots of flavor but I did modify it a little. I used 1 can of potato soup and 1 can celery with a 1 lb boneless pork loin and added about 3 sliced celery stalks, a small bag of frozen red potatoes, half an onion (thinly sliced), a pinch of sea salt, and a dash of onion salt and garlic powder. I also cooked it on high for 1 1/2 hours and low for about 3 and it came out perfectly.

This was surprisingly tender and tasty.  After rubbing it with olive oil, poultry seasoning, black pepper and crushed dried rosemary, I seared the roast on all sides before putting it in the crock pot with the celery soup. I did not add anything extra in the way of veggies. The meat was very moist and sliced nicely. I served it with mashed potatoes, the "gravy" from the crock pot, steamed broccoli, and green leaf lettuce topped with sliced tomato, a sprinkle of oregano and a dab of mayo. Crusty rolls were used to sop up the extra gravy (it was all family, so no one cared!)and fresh cut fruit was dessert.

Instead of tenderloin, I used the cheaper pork loin (and had to use one can cream of celery and one cream of mushroom because it was all I had).  It was tender and delicious.  My family LOVED it!  One of the kids even asked if she could have it on her birthday (the highest of compliments).  Thanks for a such a simple winner.

The base recipe with the changes would be 5 stars. Followed others' suggestions on this one and also some mods myself:  browned the roast on all sides first. Used 1 can cream of celery condensed, 1 can cream of mushroom condensed, 1 packet of onion soup mix (dry), and 1/2 soup can of water. Added carrots and onions, a bay leaf, and pepper to taste. Served with rice. Extremely picky husband had seconds.

I just made this last night and haven't had a chance to actually sit down and eat it but let me tell you this recipe is a keeper!!  I added about 4 potatoes cut into chunks and some baby carrots- also added an additional can of soup, undiluted, which made the best gravy for the pork!  I also used 2 tenderloins which I seasoned and seared in a pan before putting into the slow cooker. YUMMY.

This is a good slow cooker recipe, but I honestly don't think you need to use a tenderloin for it. Cooking in a crockpot in a gravy is much more suited to a loin roast or chops in my opinion, they need slow cooking to stay moist and tender, a tenderloin doesn't really. Sauteed onion and black pepper are good additions.

I used 1 tsp of Alpine Touch Montana's Special Spice & pepper blend to give this recipe the kick it needed and served over white rice with green beans.  My husband could eat this every night of the week. Great easy recipe worth the 2 minutes it takes to put it in the crockpot.

So, so good! I took suggestions from others and browned the roast, then seasoned with garlic and lemon pepper. Added carrots, celery and potatoes, then mixed 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of mushroom, and 1 pkg. onion soup mix. Baked in the oven @ 350 degrees for about 3 hours. Excellent!

Add the extra can of condensed soup. You'll be glad you did. The only alteration I made was an extra can of soup & onion soup mix (per nother reviewer for more flavor). I found it to excellent & I always found any slow cooker times to be based on you crock pot.

I was looking for a very quick recipe.  It did the trick and it was very good.  If you have very little time to cook, this is a recipe for you.

So basic, yet so good!  The gravy this makes is delicious!  I have also added a package of dry onion soup mix before.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, WYLE3!

OMG!  This recipe was soooo good that we didn't want to stop eating! Mmmmmm!  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of potato soup.  I also rubbed the tenderloin with pepper and garlic powder and browned it first.  We had enough left over that we had it again the next night too!  Great recipe!

I browned the tenderloin with garlic powder, paprika, and ground pepper rubbed on it, then added it to the crockpot with a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of onion. (in addition to covering the meat, I made sure I had covered the bottom of the crock with the soup, that way it is surrounded) sliced fresh carrots added 1 hour before serving. Will definately make this again, easy and tasty. Having the yummy leftovers tonight!

Be very careful in how much pepper you use. Also, it's better like some of the other readers have said to brown the tenderloin before putting it in the slow cooker. Otherwise great recipe!

I followed the suggestions of others, and used 3 different types of cream soups; onion, celery, and chicken.  I also browned the tenderloin before putting into the slow cooker. The final product was fantastic!  A great recipe if you're looking for cold weather comfort food!

If you are looking for an easy but quite ordinary recipe, then this is the one for you.  The pork tenderloin is wonderfully tender, but this cut usually is.  The soups make for an o.k. gravy, but as is, this recipe is not as outstanding as some say.  You would and should modify it by adding spices and vegetables.  I expected more.  Although we enjoyed this ho-hum meal, I will not make it again.

I wanted to update my rating as I've been making it for quite awhile now, and I have found what works. This recipe as it stands is an excellent base recipe. What I do now salt and pepper the pork, and then I add 3 cans of cream of asparagus soup, and 1/4 cup of milk, stirring it in a bit. Then I sprinkle the top with one teaspoon of paprika. It is excellent (unless you don't care for asparagus).

The pork tenderloin came out very nice and not too dry as is the case with some slow cooked meals.  I mixed with egg noodles and served...  it looked a bit like stroganoff, and tasted good.

This recipe is so versitale, now that I've tried the basic version I can see how adding your favorite vegetables would only enhance the great flavor, the pork turn out so moist, tender and just fell apart in teh gravy, I will add another can of soup though, there did not seem to be enough gravy to go around for my family and I will add carrots and rutabega as well. Any of those root vegetables will do nicely ini the crock pot! Thankx Anita...

this was a great easy meal although i took the advice from others and generously seasoned the pork with lemon pepper seasoning.  then i combined 1 can cream of celery with 1 can of cambell's golden mushroom soup.  it made a wonderful gravy that was nice with rice.

i did add a lot to this recipe - seasoned the meat, i added potatoes, celery, carrots, and onion, and used one can cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken (didn't have 2 celery soups in the pantry).  all in all this was a pretty ok dinner for a slow-cooker canned soup concoction, but it's not something i'll likely make again.  appreciate the ease of the slow cooker though, as always!

Came out great, added potatoes, and blended the cream of mushroom since my wife hates mushrooms, she never knew they were in there. Used cream of potatoes also as recommended. Not a 5 because the inside of the tenderloin was a little dry, but good.

This was a success! I think its hard to find tasty crock pot recipes. I read other reviews and based on what I had in the cabinet, I used a big can of cream of mushroom, added French's fried onions, minced garlic, and a little white wine and poured over tenderloin. Makes enough sauce so I made rice to go with it. Cooked on high for 4 hours and came out good. I would have preferred to slow cook it on low for 8 hours but I didnt have that option! 7 yr old asked for seconds so it must have been really good!

THis did not have much flavor and was a waste of a normally tender piece of meat.  I am not harsh on easy/slow cooked recipes, but this one was a bust.  Sorry.

Yummy!!!   Tryed this on a day that both my husband and I had to work.  I used some of the suggestions, adding one can of Cr. of Celery Soup, and one can of Cr. of Chicken, 2 small onions; sliced, a few stalks of celery;diced, and a few cloves of crushed garlic and 1/2 cup cooking wine.  Added 3-4 carrots 2 hours before serving and great with mashed potatoes!  Will certainly make this one again and again!

I followed someone's suggestion and used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken. I also used pork shoulder instead of tenderloin, all of which is because that's what I had on hand. Turned out GREAT! Highly recommend trying it with these two soups instead of celery...although next time I'm going to try it as written, just didn't have cream of celery on hand. Thanks for an easy meal!

WOW!!!  I used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken soups.  I also added a can of mushrooms and one can of  diced potatoes.  It was an awesome meal.  I made wide noodles with it and it was supreme!  The sauce with the potatoes and mushrooms was to die for!  I will make it the same exact way next time.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy.  I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Celery as thats what I had on hand.  Pork tenderloin already cooks up tender but the soup gave it a great flavor.  I fixed mashed potatoes and spooned the gravy over it.  Will fix this again.

This was pretty good.  I have to admit that I didn't read the reviews before making...and I think that I should have.  The taste was a bit average and didn't have much to wow us.  Also, it was a bit salty.  I think I may try again and spice it up.  It really was an easy recipe.  Thanks.

Delicious!  So tender. Used low sodium cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. Pork fell apart while trying to slice while hot but easy to slice when cool.   Leftovers make great sandwiches.

Wow, this couldn't be easier and tastes great.  I seasoned the pork loin liberally with garlic pepper, used 2 cans cream of celery soup, and cooked on low 8 hours as directed.  The pork stayed moist and the soup makes a great gravy.  The only drawback is it doesn't look all that appetizing, something about the color of the soup. Maybe I could have done something better with the presention - definitely tastes SO much better than it looks!!!

Tasted great and was a cinch to make! I used venison loin, instead of pork. Using the tips from others, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. I added a can of mushrooms and a can of diced potato. I served this over whole wheat pasta.

This was really good, but I did add some stuff. I added carrots and potatoes, and some rosemary. I served this over mashed potatoes.

Absolutely delicious.  I seared the pork on all sides before putting it in the crock pot, both for presentation and flavor.  It didn't help the presentation because the meat was so tender after 8 hours that it fell apart when I tried to move it.  No matter.  Dinner was a hit.

This was great and so easy!  I made some changes...used 1 can cream of mushroom and a packet of dry onion gravy mix, added a can of water and a bunch of sliced fresh mushrooms on top.  I thickened the gravy before serving, it was delicous over white rice. The pork was fall apart tender.  Thanks for the idea!

Surprisingly my picky-picky 3 and 8 yrs olds ate this, told them it was chicken stew.  Tweaked it slightly.  Used a pork rib on the tenderloin, browned in olive oil.  Put the pork in the slow cooker on High for 10 hours to make sure it was cooked through and super tender.  Used 1 can each Crm of Mushroom, Chicken and Onion, plus 1/2 can white wine. Added a bag of baby carrots after 4 hours, and 8 oz sliced mushrooms 1 hour before serving.  Was a little watery because of the wine, but that added a nice flavor to it, so I would keep the wine and thicken slightly.  Served over rice and was shocked when I got thumbs up from both kids

I made this today with a turkey tenderloin that was already flavored with lemon. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery. I added 2 cans of water. Once all stirred together o put the tenderloins in and cooked on low for 6 hours then took out the tenderloin and sliced it. That way I could just scoop and have the meat in each scoop. Then added a can  of corn and a can of  green beans and cooked for 2.5 more hours on low.

Made as the recipe recommended, I wasn't a fan. It came out a little dry on the inside and very bland. Needs a little bit more kick to make it an actual dish.

Made this for supper a few nights ago, and will definitely make again.  So easy, and delicious. Whole family of 4 loved it, except for the picky 3 year old but he doesn't like any meat really. Like other reviewers, I used cream of mushroom soup, and am pretty sure that's what I would do next time too. I used a 4 lb pork roast, cut it into 4 large pieces and browned them before putting into the crock pot with the soup, some  carrots, and onions. Served with rice (poured the gravy over the meat and rice), green peas, mac and cheese and bread. Have been still eating off of the pork and rice for 3 days - 2 suppers off of it, lunch for one, supper for one of us again and there's still enough left for another serving or two.

Awesome!  I browned the tenderloin as suggested by other reviewers.  Added the two cans of cream of celery soup and cooked on low for several hours.  Then I added 2 - 14 oz. bags of "birdseye - baby potato and vegetable medley" frozen veggies and a sprinkling of frozen corn(1/2 cup?)for the last hour(give or take). Hubby actually enjoyed the veggies the most.  This will be included in our rotation of meals from now on! SSOOO SIMPLE!

This was very bland and gooey, pretty one-note on flavor.  I noticed in the other reviews people add a whole lot of spices, vegitables and other soups so I am sure it is better heavily doctored.  So I guess two cans of soup and meat really isn't a recipe.  I admit, I used this "recipe" because I was  down to a few pantry basics and was trying to get dinner going without going to the store.  I guess I get what I deserve for not going with something more creative.

A perfectly easy and delicious recipe.  I only had cream of broccoli soup in the house so used that and added a bag of baby carrots as I had read in other reviews.  The pork pulled apart into succulent shreds that I served over brown rice.

I didn't care for this at all.  I added Montreal Chicken Seasoning and some veggies, then used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom.  The taste was still bland - nothing enticing, particularly considering the cost of pork tenderloin.  It is one of our favorite cuts of meat, but this recipe just didn't do anything for it.  I would not make this again.

This recipe gets five stars for easy but its only average in taste. I did add some sliced onion in with the soups and served over hot white rice. You might want to consider using the low sodium soups that are available as we found it a tad salty...and we are folks that love our salt (sad to admit).  Its a nice recipe when you know your not going to have time to cook but we weren't "wowed" either. Thanks!

This is another staple at our house.  I use my crock pot alot, and this receipe can't be any simpler.  I rub both kosher salt and fresh ground pepper into the tenderloin before pouring the soup over.  Thanks for sharing this!

I love pork from the slow cooker.  This is a little bland, but smooth.  The pork is so tender!  Gonna try it with one can of celery and one of chicken and see if it spices it up.

Very easy! Meat was nice and tender, although the sauce/gravy was a bit thin. Not extraordinary, but good comfort food.

Simple and delicious. Used cream of celery and cream of mushroom soups. Added snap peas, baby carrots and one red potato, cubed. Also added 2 tbls soy sauce, two tbls Worcestershire sauce & 2 tbls of Louisiana hot sauce. Added broccoli florets in the last hour. Cook for six hours on low. Served over rice - the pork is fork tender.

Excellent basic recipe and easy to adapt to one’s own preferences.  Like most here, I changed the soups to what I already had in the cupboard and added one more can in order to stretch the gravy. Also added some sour cream to the gravy. I know it sounds like I changed too much to rate the recipe a five, but I would never have thought to cook the tenderloin like this and, as I said, is very simple to adapt to individual tastes. Thanks for this one!

The pork was very tender and the sauce went well with it. The sauce was good over rice. The amount of pepper is important. If you use a lot of freshly ground black pepper, it tastes hot.

Trying this today. Did one cream of mush, one can skim milk, one packet onion/mush soup,  garlic powder, potatoes and carrots. Browned tenderloins after cutting off silver. Inside of loins were still a little frozen, so definitely needed to be browned. Cooking on low for 6 hrs then adding mushrooms.

honestly, not a fan. Pork cooked up fine, but the entire dish, we felt, was too creamy and not fresh. I used cr of celery and mush soup, and added potatoes, celery and carrots. We ate it, but won't try it again.

Flavourful and creamy though the pork was a little dry. I may try this again and tweak it a bit.

I never would have thought about cooking a pork tenderloin in a slow cooker until I read this recipe!  This was wonderful!  I admit that I followed some suggestions of other reviewers:  I browned the tenderloin first and I didn't use the cream of celery soup (I just don't like celery!). Instead, I used cream of potato and cream of mushroom soup. I also cut up a potato or two and threw in some baby carrots.  One time I even threw in asparagus!  It's very, very good--the whole family loves it!

Delicious!  I only had a 1 lb. tenderloin, so I cooked for 7 hours.  It was on the verge of being dry, so next time I'll cook only 6 hours.  I also injected the meat with some roasted red pepper juice, and it was the perfect addition.  Added carrots and mushrooms, which worked perfectly.

Great recipe.  My family loved it.  I used one cream of chicken and one cream of celery and added some spices to the tenderloin and it was wonderful.  We make again.  Thanks.

My man thought this was simply OK. He did eat quite a bit, but I think it was more due to the fact that he was hungry, not because he really enjoyed it. I didn't get a chance to try it.

i really liked this. i started out though with a teriyaki seasoned pork roast, because it had been on sale at the store, and know next time to use just a plain pork roast! i added a can of cream of chicken, and a can of cream of mushroom, as well as the celery soups. we like lots of gravy.

I found this to be "OKAY."  Nothing really too spectacular... the pork was quite tender, though given the cost of tenderloin, I think another cut of pork would be more cost efficient.  If I made it again, I'd probably add some veggies - at the least, mushrooms...

This was good, very very easy. The meat was very tender and great w/the gravy over white rice. Celery soup was a bit overpowering and I think i used to much pepper.

Needs more spices.  The porky smell is really strong throughout the cooking time and it's a turn-off.

Excellent-a new family staple.  I used 98% fat free soup for a lighter version.
