I had to make a lot of changes to make this good. The proportions are all wrong. I give this version 5 stars: Use 3/4 of a cup of diced red onion, and 3/4 of a cup of diced green peppers, for one zucchini. Use half a jar (at the most) of sliced and pitted black olives. You need at least a half a cup of feta. When layering, mix in at least 1/2 a teaspoon of rosemary and a pinch of black pepper. (Or it will be tasteless). Also, layer in one teaspoon of finely diced capers. Non-stick oil is not required - it has a lot of moisture due to the veges. A thin film of olive oil on the bottom is plenty. I made these changes and it turned out excellent. It would have been tasteless and disproportionate if I had followed the original recipe. (Other reviews have mentioned that it is "missing something" and I agree. It is missing rosemary and capers and a little pepper)

Wow, this was among the easiest and yet tasty recipes ever. I got the greek vinegarette recipe here under  Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing. This was an incredible find and will be on the menu at least once a  week.

Made this twice, once as written, then next with the revized directions by 'famouscook', and as a consideration, I didn't review the first try. However, I love zucchini and tried the second time with wonderful results. I don't know who you are, but I love you... : ) Gave YOU five stars.

This was wonderful.  I made a few changes, by adding a clove of minced garlic, fresh basil, and 1 (4oz) olives.

this was pretty good.. however.. i think if i were to marinate the veggies before hand it would have taken it to a whole other level ..lol.. i look forward to making this dish again.. but i have to get olives! i love greek food, and this was so simple to make! and its fairly healthy.. i used a very light dressing instead of a regular.. but overal it was pretty good! but it was missing a lil something.. not sure what.. but something lol maybe the olives lol.. will definately make this for my sister when she comes next time!

There must be a typing error, I never would have put 2 cans of black olives!
It depends on your preferences too. You can add more or less of any veggie or try different ones as well as a different dressing. It's a very easy and versatile recipe.

I thought this was pretty good.  I followed the suggestions made by famous cook and am glad I did.  Had never had capers before, but found the to be pretty tasty.  Will definitely make this again using the suggested modifications.

The basics here are wonderful.  It took some adjusting to suit my tastes, and I baked it in the oven in a deep casserole, uncovered.  To keep with the Greek theme, I added oregano, garlic and used kalamata olives.  I baked the tomatoes with the other veggies and added the cheese the last 15 minutes.  The guests loved it.

One of the best zuchinni dishes ever! I didn't have a Greek viniagrette dressing and used a sun dried tomato one instead and it was fabulous! My kids even like this.  Excellent balance of flavors.

Definitely missing something. Maybe I'll try adding rosemary or tyme next time. Also You seriously don't need TWO 4 oz cans of sliced black olives. One was more than enough.

Definitely follow famouscooks' suggestions. I used 3/4 of a cup of diced red onion and 3/4 of a cup of diced green peppers, for one zucchini. Used 20 kalamata olives (I sliced and diced). I used at least a half a cup of fat-free feta. When layering, mix in at least 1/2 a teaspoon of rosemary and freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder; I didn't have Greek vinaigrette dressing I used an olive oil vinegrette dressing.  I also, layered in finely diced capers. I put about 1T. of the olive oil on the foil and omitted the non-stick spray.  YUMMY! But, the feta didn't melt for me unlike the picture.  UPDATE: I tried it in a casserole dish and did not like it at all. The ingredients and flavors didn't melt together; it makes a better presentation in a casserole dish but doesn't taste as good as the foil version. Definitely a keeper in the foil with slight alterations.

This was surprisingly very tasty. I had a little tomato & basil feta so I used the rest of that and combined with with regular feta which helped to give it more flavor. I also added the tomatoes at the very end and roasted them just a little. I think it gives the tomatoes and the dish so much more flavor. I also followed some of FamousCook's recommendations in his/her review. Overall: Very Yummy

This is a delicious way to get your veggies! Instead of baking, I just did mine on the stovetop, adding the tomoatoes and feta at the end of cooking. It was a hit and I would definitely make it again!

Like the previous reviewer, season the zucchini with ground pepper and dried rosemary and EVOO. Put in a baking pan and add a tasty hummus in between the layers. Bake in oven til bubbly.

I'm always looking for good vegetable recipes that aren't boring (i.e. just zucchini, just green beans, etc) - this fits the bill. Used the recipe as a jumping off point for my own version: red peppers instead of green, no tomato, lots of olives and feta cheese. Awesome.

I made this without the tomatoes (because I didn't have any on hand) and threw in some mushrooms (ecause they had to be used up) and it was still very good. I'm sure the tomatoes will make it even better.  I'm also going to try one of the suggestion of adding some rosemary. I agree about increasing the portions of onions and feta (but not the green peppers)

It was allright, although i wouldnt serve this as a main dish, more of a side dish. I think this dish would probably go well with a cheese omelette, or perhaps a filling for a Baked Potato. 

I made two adaptions. I used 3/4 the amount of olives that you suggested, and i also added a bit of fresh chopped basil on the top.

Oh and instead of cooking it in foil, i just layered up all the ingredients in a casserole dish, with the lid on, for 30 mins, then removed the lid and cook for 5 mins.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  It needed better cohesion and even though I cooked it longer than called for, it still seemed a bit sloppy to me. I wasn't sure how to present it so I put it in a small bowl.  personally I think the zucchini should be cut lengthwise and then that's it, not into slices. Then I would put some feta cheese on the zucchini and again on the top.  And I definintely would pan fry the onions and pepper first before layering. The flavor was OK with rosemary, salt and pepper but just a boring dish overall.

My husband liked this much better than i did.  I used more cheese and more dressing and hubby said the cheese made the dish.

Really easy to make though and no clean up.

Even if your not crazy about zucchini (which I'm not) you'll love the flavor combo in this dish.

Too hot to cook it, so I served it uncooked.  Great, fresh salad on a summers day!

Delicious! I've made it twice and will be making it again. I add extra oregano & black pepper to emphasise the Greek-style flavour.

This was so so when it was hot - 3 stars. Then i took the refrigerated leftovers for lunch the next day and it was fabulous as a cold salad - 5 stars. So much more flavor and crisper texture. I will make again ahead of time and serve cold.

My husband liked it! He liked the amount of olives, but next time we'll add some pepperoncini. I cooked it in a pie pan for ease of serving at the table and it came out just fine.
