Next time I will do the following: 
Add a lot more salt and pepper to the flour mixture. Also add some italian seasoning and garlic powder to the mixture.
 Dip chicken in egg before coating, brown chicken before placing in crock pot. Saute onion along with garlic before adding to crock pot, then use marsala to deglaze the pan.
 Those steps will increase prep time, but hopefully it'll positivelly affect the outcome.

Need cornstarch and water. I'm serving this with Onion Rice and Candied Carrots. Yummy! Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Yes it was delicious!  I didn't have the time to slow cook this recipe so I changed things up a little.  I used thin boneless chicken breast. 1 pkg fresh mushrooms sauteed in 2tbls butter 3-5 min till tender.  I added 1tsp onion powder 1tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper to flour.  I used 1 cup ck broth 1 cup true blue marsala wine in pan drippings to create sauce to pour on top of ck. I cooked ck 3 min per side then put in casserole dish pour sauce on top of ck and shrooms then add 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup parmesan and bake in oven on 425 degrees for 25 min. All done. Yummy!

OK...so I followed the other commenters feedback and dredged the chicken in eggs and a spicier flour mix. I also sautéed the garlic and onions and then deglazed with the marsala. It felt like I could have just cooked without the slow cooker. It tasted reasonable but not one I would be rushing to do again.

We eat chicken almost every supper. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, dredged it in flour flavored with garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, salt and fresh ground paper. I added a kick to it by putting a very small amount of cayenne pepper.  I cooked an onion in the same pan and  I deglazed the pan with the marsala and a tablespoon of lemon juice. I then transferred it to slow cooker and cooked it for four hours. Served it with rice. There were plenty of leftovers. My husband wants me to make it again.

I was told this was one of my best dinners! I did make some adjustments. I used more flour to thicken the sauce and added thyme and garlic powder.  I browned the chicken in a frying pan with olive oil after shaking it in the flour bag.  I added thinly sliced onions to the slow cooker. I also added the mushrooms the last 20 minutes because someone in the house can pick them out (does not like mushrooms). This kept the mushrooms more firm. Also, I used 1 cup of Marsala & 1 cup of chicken broth.  I served the dish with rice, fresh green beans with almonds, and hard round French rolls. YUM!

This was a hit with my family and I will definitely be making it again.  I changed a couple of things.  I put the oil, garlic, and mushrooms into the bottom of the crock pot and mixed it around.   I took a 3 lb package of chicken breast and sliced them into strips.   I put the chicken strips into a freezer bag with 3 packets of McCormick Chicken Marsala seasoning mix and mixed it well, coating all the chicken.  I laid the chicken strips on top of the mushrooms in the crock pot.  Then I added the wine (which I boiled for 2 minutes prior) and 2 cans of beef broth.  I cooked all of this on low for about 5 hours.  I added the cornstarch and water at the end which made a wonderful gravy.  I served this with mashed potatoes and sweet peas. Everyone went back for seconds, including my kids.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for convince. I made this recipe without any adjustments and was very disappointed in it. This is a very tasteless and bland recipe. You really need to kick it up in the spice department. I won't be making this again.

VERY disappointed in this recipe, as I was looking forward to making it for some time.  If I could give less than one star I would.  I read ALL the reviews and thank goodness I did, otherwise this dish would have been relegated to the trash.  I followed the recommendations to add ALOT more seasoning, but nothing could overcome the complaints that others echoed about the chicken breast being extremely dry.  Maybe this might be better if thighs were used, but I won’t be wasting time trying any time soon.  As far as I am concerned this dish was a waste of four beautiful boneless skinless chicken breasts that could have been grilled or broiled.... and succulent.  If I was served this dish in a restaurant I would have sent it back, and requested something else.

So delicious and easy!  I added cauliflower with the chicken and slow cooked for 6 hours then added chickpeas in the last 30 minutes with the heavy cream .  I served it over jasmine rice and  Naan bread.  This made it even more filling.

I loved it! There's just 2 of us, but the leftovers are handy. I did use some suggestions by other reviewers, and I added garlic and basil.  I believe next time I'd skip coating the chicken and just brown lightly as is, then add a little flour to the sauce at the end. I love white meat but my husband, not so much. He enjoyed this, but not like me! I will use it for company though.

Using the flour before hand, I believe, made for a weird looking sauce....   the flavor was good, but too powerful.     Should blend marsala wine and a broth.
I may make it again, without using the flour as I found in another recipe from another site.
Also, my crockpot may have been too big for this small recipe.

I made this recipe gluten free with a couple of changes and it came out outstanding! I changed wheat flour for half millet flour and half  tapioca flour. Then at the end of the cooking time I added tapioca starch to thicken the sauce a bit. I also changed Marsala for 1/3 of brandy and 2/3 white wine. This is a keeper . Everyone liked it!

My company loved it. I used the brandy and white wine, and a cup of chicken broth, and baked it in the oven, because I didn’t have time to cook it in the crockpot. I also used much more garlic,  and sautéed onions. It was quite good. Thanks for the tips to make it great.

Disappointed with this recipe. Used porcini mushrooms & added additional spices to the flour mixture as some suggested. It was still pretty blah. After thinking about all the things I could do to make this better, decided to just not use this recipe again.

We liked this very much. This is an easy dish to make. I followed the recipe exactly. The leftovers are just as good!  We rated this a 4 because my family likes restaurant chicken better!  Instead of being discouraged, this tells me this recipe is pretty darn good!

This turned out very well and my husband and kids loved it!  I chopped and sautéed 6 shallots in butter and browned the chicken before putting it in the crock pot.  I boiled the Marsala in the pan with the dripping and served this over mashed potatoes.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good flavor. The only thing was that the chicken was a little dry. Not sure if it's a fault of the recipe or perhaps my slow cooker. But, I really liked the recipe and it was easy to make.

Followed the recipe except I added extra pepper and italian seasoning to the flour, came out a little bland.  Chicken was tender but did need to add corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up.

Followed directions and turned out great. I have made this twice now and my family loves it.

Not sure what happened but the sauce was bitter.  Had to put it in a skillet and doctor it up to serve.
