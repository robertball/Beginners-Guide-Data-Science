I made this for Thanksgiving for my family and also for a covered dish at work.  My co-workers literally fought over the last portion!  We have a cook-out coming up in a few weeks and everyone at work is begging for me to bring this again.  It is a huge hit!  One thing I did find the second time I made it is that if you beat the eggs, half-and-half and cream first until fluffy, then slowly add the other ingredients one at a time - corn last, the consistency is much lighter and fluffier!  GREAT recipe - will make it again and again!

I've tried lots of corn pudding recipes with the same result--"It doesn't taste like my Grandmother used to make"--Gotta love your husbands! I found this one and it surpassed my husband's expectations. It came out creamy and not runny. Allow enough time to cook, depending on your oven it may take longer. I also used a water bath for even cooking in the oven. Give it some time for cooling before serving so your servings will hold shape better. Definitely worth the wait!!

I used this recipe Thanksgiving 2007.  Trust me, it was so rich and truly delicious.  Do not change the recipe.  I had to leave it in the oven an additional 15 minutes to gel in the middle.  It was absolutely the best corn pudding that I've ever made.

I found this recipe when desparately searching for a filling recipe to supplement my Thanksgiving meal for vegetarian guests.  

I went crazy with the scaling and had THREE 9x11" pans so they were able to take some home, too. 

Great recipe! Everyone loved it .. meat eaters included!

DISASTER!  Altho, having read other reviews, I carefully drained the corn, I ended up with a most unappealing soupy mess on the Thanksgiving table.  And that will remind me, once again, never to serve an untried dish to company.  Since so many other people had far better success, I guess I need to shoulder the blame--but I cannot imagine where I went so wrong.

Easy to make. Rich and creamy sort of comfort food. A dash of cinnamon cuts some of the blandness. Freezes well.

My wife loves corn pudding. This is the one dish about which she says her mom's is better.  I told her she's wrong. I think it's wonderful and her mom's is way too salty not as good, and no matter what she thinks, she cannot like her mom's more.

This was easy to make and fabulous taste.  I made for a Thanksgiving potluck and everyone enjoyed it.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and beat the half and half, eggs and cream together first, then slowly added dry ingredients - resulted in very fluffy texture.  I also added twice the sugar and salt and pepper to my taste.

It was excellent ~ a big hit at dinner with family. The recipe was simple and easy to mix (no special order or dividing of ingredients). Be sure to grease your pan thoroughly. I baked in a 9x13 glass casserole, using butter to grease the sides & bottom. The mixture filled the dish completely, but it didn't bubble over during cooking. Next time, I plan to add some shredded mild cheddar cheese and possibly a little sauteed onion to add flavor and texture. However, the recipe is great "as is"!

Delicious.  Texture was not what I expected.  It was pretty well done, and not pudding in texture at all.   More like a cake.  Maybe I over-cooked it.

This was o.k.. A little bland for our taste. Should have been sweeter. Maybe more sugar or salt Im not sure. Any suggestions?? I'm not sure if I'll try again.

So rich and wonderful.  Worth every calorie.  But like a dunce, and a new cook, I didn't know to drain the corn.  I was taught to always follow recipes to the letter and draining was not specified.  I know now!  I will keep this recipe for next year.

I adore this recipe.  I only make it on holidays, since it is so rich, but it is delicious.  I recommend making less than you think you'll need, as I have found people don't take huge servings, but I do like it as a leftover also.

I made this for Thanksgiving and followed the recipe exactly; it was quite disappointing.  The "pudding" had a watery texture and it was very bland tasting.  I could have just served buttered corn and it would have tasted better.  I am sorry to say I won't be using this recipe again.

A hit with wife for Thanksgiving '05.  To kick it up a notch I added nutmeg.  A real winner.

I've read all the corn pudding recipes and many mention they're a little bland.  My brother's trick is to add some chopped jalepeno peppers (or just lay sliced jalepenos on top before baking).  It gives just the right "kick"!

I made the corn pudding for the 1st time on Thanksgiving for my family. Everyone loved it and no leftovers.  I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and drain the whole kernel corn.  Will make it on Sunday for the church luncheon.  Thanks.

Just delicious!  Not overly sweet and had a nice consistency.  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and it was perfect.  I left it in the oven about 1 hr and 20 min and the center was still a little wet but it solidified nicely as it sat out.  I will be making this again at the next holiday dinner.  Thanks for sharing!

Good, took longer to bake than recipe stated. I felt like it was missing something, so next time I make it, I will play around with ingredients. Overall a good starter recipe.

I can't ever imagine this becoming anything but what it was: globs of corn with chunky goo all around it. I halved this recipe and cooked it for TWO HOURS and it was still just runny, chunky . I should've known when I was making it.

This was nice and well received around the table. It took a good solid 70 minutes at 350 to really firm up and turn a pleasing golden brown.

This is the most heavenly corn pudding I have ever tasted,  I made it easier by melting the butter in the casserole dish then adding  spices and flours. Then I removed from heat added all regular corn (so I doubled the butter) and everything eles in recipe . There is no need to whip eggs as I blended everything with a standing blender. The changes I made- doubled the corn meal and sugar, used semolina flour instead and doubled that also and used sour cream instead of heavy cream added tons of fresh ground black pepper and plenty of salt and it was really rich and peppery- delicious

The flavor is a bit bland. I halved it  exactly as recommended with the  3 eggs as suggested.  May absolutely NO changes. It cooked in a preheated 350 degree oven in 7x9 glass pan for exactly 1 hour. I think i would not half the cornmeal or sugar  next time. Its not quite sweet enough and needs more cornmeal. I think these two things would fix the lack  of flavor.I may even saute a few tablespoons of red bell pepper for a bit of color and taste. I've have it with the peppers  prior and they really bumped up the flavor. Still in search of the perfect recipe. I may have to create it myself.

DELICIOUS & Easy! I made it for the first time & it turned out perfectly! I got lots of compliments!
HOWEVER,, you need to add the sour cream, include the juice from the whole kernel can of corn ,and 2 beaten eggs. I used light sour cream. 
So much more interesting & tastier than just plain corn. This will be one of our new regular dishes!

Pretty much perfect in terms of texture and flavor, and that's making it with all half-and-half (no heavy whipping cream in the house since I used it all up making boiled custard for New Year's ;) ). I added just a pinch of ground nutmeg and an extra half-teaspoon of flour since I wasn't using the heavy cream.

This was a little different than expected. I was looking more for the Gooden Corral version of corn pudding. This was more of a custard

The recipe called for an hour, but it took my oven 1hr 45min. at 350°. In the end the taste was really good, but I prefer the recipe with just sour cream.

It was good, but not the corn pudding that I'd loved from previous pot lucks, which was made from a recipe including sour cream.  I made the recipe as written, only adding cinnamon, and it came out well.  It wasn't popular at the Thanksgiving dinner I attended, but they're an unadventurous crowd who go for the "traditional" green bean casserole and canned sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows.  I have plenty of leftovers, so I hope it indeed does freeze well.

If you end up with "a soupy mess" then perhaps you missed the part that says to cook an hour or "until set." You may need to cook it longer than an hour for it to set. Add a little more sugar if you like it sweeter. I definitely like it sweeter.

Delicious! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year for my family and it was a huge success! Slightly sweet, perfect consistency. The only issue I had was the baking time. I actually had to bake 45 minutes longer than the recipe stated even after splitting the batch into two pans. (Total bake time 1hr45min, last 15 mins using convection setting to brown the top) Also, if you are serving a smaller family/party, try cutting the recipe in half.

Halved the recipe so we didn't have too much; perfect!  Baked in a 9 x 13 glass pan and timing was correct.  Best corn pudding I have ever made!!

This either wasn't the recipe I thought it was, or it just came out terrible. It was very bland, and tasted like little more than corn with curdled cream on top.
