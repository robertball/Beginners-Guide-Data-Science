Sooo delicious!  Was a bit worried about lack of whipped cream in the filling (which most other similar recipes include), but I think the banana layers serve the same purpose by lightening the cream cheese and peanut butter mix.  And I used an extra banana in the filling plus a fourth to decorate the top.  Also, it needed a little longer than 15 minutes at room temperature for optimal serving texture.

This was really good and really rich.  I used a shortbread crust because that was what I had on hand.  I served it to guests and it got rave reviews.

I will have to tweak it a bit in order to amp up the flavor.t As others have suggested--skip bittersweet, go full on sweet! I used organic peanut butter, but I might go with the processed kind next time, since it tends to be a bit sweeter. AND, last but not least, I'll make my own chocolate crust next time. The store bought kind lacked serious richness, and really only tasted like banana come serving time.

I made this recipe as is....it was quite good, though not quite as sweet as I'd prefer. Most likely this was due to the use of bitter-sweet chocolate.

Not my favorite to this day. Peanut Butter pie to me is very traditional but I wanted to try the banana in it. I wasn't a fan. It really should be a clean smooth silky texture which this pie really did not have. It  just was not to my liking.

I used a regular graham crust and did a chocolate bottom using 1/2 c semi sweet and 2 T milk, melted and  spread over crust then chilled before filling.  Also used semi sweet for top.  Cut my bananas  WAY too thick   so I left off the second layer of pb /cream cheese and the middle chocolate layer.  Didn't have the nuts but will layer them in next time as well as on top.  I liked it much more than I expected specifically because it wasn't too sweet.
