We liked this! I did use diet cola b/c that's all I had on hand, but you couldn't tell. This marinade made the steaks nice and flavorful...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

In my experience with it (I don't think I cooked the meat completely correctly),the sauce actually worked just as well for steak sauce. Tasted much like an on brand steak sauce most would know if mentioned. Only slightly off from that recipe, and made basically a quart of it at one time. Was Very excited to learn this!

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.   Good balance to the flavor profile, nothing too
