Campbell's - I have cooked many of your recipes before with varying rates of success and although this was good and savory - it still needs a liquid ingredient.  An expert cook may know this but a novice may not. I started this recipe at 8am INCLUDING an added 1/2c beef broth (using 1/2c water and 1 tsp beef boullion) and turned my crockpot on low.  Around noonish - I checked it and it was looking pretty dry.  In my haste - I added (apprx) another cup of water - I literally filled a drinking cup with water and poured/stirred it in - so I'm guessing it was close to a cup measurement.  It was still awesome and your house smells delicious. Other than the liquid addition (and going reduced sodium but not reduced fat soups) I didn't change a thing. A very easy "winter" dish to make!

Yummy! This was very good and tender (and easy). I added beef broth, a large onion, some celery and garlic. My family ate this with gusto.

I have been making this exact recipe for years, and so did my mom before me.  It was a favorite of my brother and I growing up.  Althought others have suggested adding some form of liquid to the meat there is no need to do so.  As long as you cook on low your meat will come out perfectly tender 6 to 8 hours later.  I have cooked smaller roasts for slightly less time, and much larger roasts for a few hours longer, adding an extra can of soup or the larger roasts.  The only change we make is that we don't pour the mixture in then coat the meat with it.  We do as follows: 1. Line baking dish with aluminum foil (make it lon enough to wrap around the meat) or one of those reynolds oven bags  2. place the meat in the baking dish  3. spread the cream of mushroom soup over the top of the meat and down the sides  4. sprinkle onion soup mix over top  5.  add veggies around meat  6. wrap and tent the meat with the aluminum foil or close the oven bag  7. Cook at 275 for 6 to 8 hours  ENJOY!!!!  If done correctly the meat comes out so tender it melts in your mouth and it makes its own gravy.  My brother and I called this stringy meat when we were little because it literally falls apart and almost looks stringy.

I have been making this recipe for years. Before bed I prepare it. Line a small roast pan with foli ( enough to cover everything) add your meat, potatoes, carrots along side of meat. Mix onion soup with cream of mushroom soup and pour over everything, In the morning before I go to work I pop it into a 275 degree oven and slow cook for 6-8 hour. When I get home from work, make a few rolls and your meal is ready. Perfect gravy, perfect meat & veggies. Simple and easy.  Great to make a beef pot pie with any leftovers, just slice everything and add to pastry.Bake at 400 for 20-30 minutes.

My kids LOVED this recipe! And believe me they are not easy to please. I added two cans of the mushroom soup because one did not even coat the meat. I also only cooked on low for 6 hours because it was cooked by then. If I had cooked the full 8 hours it would have been overcooked. Will definitely make this again!

For those of you who read Cooks Magazine, it's a mistake to include the vegetables with the beef in a slow cooker recipe. They end up as mush after a 5-8 hour cycle. The solution is to toss the veggies in a little olive olive with herbs and fresh garlic. Put them in a foil package on top of the beef. This prevents them from becoming soft which would normally happen if they soaked in the juices from the beef. In other words, perfect roast and veggies!

Personally a bit salty for my taste, so I may consider adding 1/2 or 3/4 of the onion mix pouch next time.  Otherwise it made a great tender pot roast - didn't even really need a knife because it was just breaking apart (that's a good thing!)

Fantastic! I made this for my hubby's birthday dinner, the only things I did that weren't mentioned in the recipe:
1. Trim the fat from the roast
2. Liberally coat the roast with salt and pepper
3. Sear the roast until golden brown on each side (look literally 7 min altogether on medium-high heat)
and that's it, I followed the recipe exactly after that and it turned out moist and tender, the potatoes and carrots were tender as well. I am not a very good cook, and I rarely attempt red meat, but it was a huge hit and super easy, will revisit!

Great roast!  meat was very tender and had a lot of flavor with some modifications.  I made a rub for the roast then seared it.  added two cans of cream of mushroom and placed vegetables and potatoes on top of roast in tin foil so that they wouldn't get mushy.  About an hour before the roast was done I placed them in with roast.  I then ate myself into a catatonic state.  YUM!!!

I was concerned about dish being too salty from the onion soup mix and/or 'uninteresting' due to cream of mushroom soup (ho-hum):  It was neither.  This dish is Very Tasty!  I omitted potatoes, used regular cream of mushroom soup, and reduced sodium onion soup mix.  Cooked 2.5 pounds chuck roast on low for 6.5 hours but it was fall apart tender 5 hours into cooking (in a 4.5 qt cooker).  I added big baby carrots 4 hours into cooking, wedge cut onions 5 hours in, then sliced fresh mushrooms 30 minutes before serving.  Veggies were perfecty cooked and not mushy. Thickened sauce w/cornstarch on the stove top.  About an inch of the roast was exposed above soup mixture--probably because I omitted potatoes.  However it didn't matter because I flipped the roast 4 hours into cooking.  I did not add any liquid.

Wow... way too salty. Think I'll stick to my crock pot roast with fresh onions and spices without all that salt. And I like salt.

Delicious!  I've made lots of briskets, but I've never made a post roast before.  I had a 3 pound chuck roast and looked at a lot of recipes before deciding on this one.  

I used small gold potatoes instead of red, and I added a large onion and a few stalks of celery.  I browned the meat first in some flour with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  I thought about adding a can of beef broth because I didn't think the soup would be enough, but I'm glad I didn't.  It was so good, I don't think I'll look any further to replace this recipe.  I'll definitely make it again!

This was pretty good. I added some fresh thyme and chopped garlic and cooked it in a slow cooker bag. I followed the recipe and added only the can of soup, but if I make this again, I would add about 1/2 a can of water or beef stock just so there is some moisture to make the roast fall-apart tender.

Before I put the roast in the slow cooker, I browned each side of the roast in a pan full of a little hot oil, this keeps the roast moist. Best way to make a roast.

Like other reviewers I changed this a little.  I don't like mushrooms so I used cream of celery coup.  I skipped the carrots.  I also added an 18 oz. can of ready to serve french onion soup.  My roast was very tender and tasty but a little dry.  I cooked for 7.5 hrs. on low.  I think next time I will try 6.5 hrs.

I also have been making this recipe for years, and have never needed to add extra liquid.  I do, however, double the soups - the sauce/gravy it makes is delicious.

I am a food SNOB.  If I wasn't sick I would not have considered this recipe because it has pre-packaged stuff.  But the roast had to be made and this was as low effort as I could find.  Picky husband even liked it.  He considered it equal to the one I make with red wine and veal stock, etc and I am sad that I've ever gone to all that effort if this suffices.  (And I'm pretty sure that french onion soup mix had to be several years old).

SO good. I doubled the mushroom soup, added a whole onion instead of the dried soup package, and put the potatoes and carrots in tin foil instead of just in with the meat and soup. The vegetables did not come out mushy and there was plenty of gravy. Not too salty either. Will make this again!

Definitely a winner.  My mom has made this version of post roast my whole life.  I was a little nervous about making it for visitors myself the first time--but it turned out wonderfully--you can't ruin it!  I received so many compliments that night.  DELICIOUS!

I was stuck indoors due to snowy weather and without onion soup mix so I used:
1/4 cup dried onion flakes 
2 tablespoons low-sodium beef bouillon granules 
1/4 teaspoon onion powder 
1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes 
1/8 teaspoon celery seed 
1/8 teaspoon paprika 
1/8 teaspoon pepper 
Alond with a can of beef broth, one onion halved, and water as it cooked to keep it moist.

I have been making this for years, and it is a Sunday dinner favorite with my family. I have cooked it on low for 8 hours and on high for 4 hours. I think the high on 4 hours works better. The meat tends to get overdone when cooked on the low setting. I also brown the roast first.

I followed the recipe for this exactly listed on the instructions.  The only thing that was quite accurate was the size of the slow cooker needed, I have a 4 qt slow cooker and the roast itself would barely fit (2.81 lbs), let alone the carrots and potatoes.  I had to end up using a 7 qt slow cooker, and by the time this was cooked there was not much room to spare.  Also I quartered the potatoes rather than halved them.  Made this for Christmas diner and my girlfriend, sister and niece loved it!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I added a can of beef broth and two gloves of garlic per other raters' opinions.  Also added a halved cooking onion.  Followed directions and it does not need to be seared first.

Turned out great. I cooked it on low for 7 hours. It could have cooked a little longer to make it more tender but it was still great.  I used a chuck roast.  Followed recipe.  It is salty, but I love salty food.

This gravy was amazing!  I am really impressed and will be making this again. I do have to mention that I added beef boullian mix to the gravy, and it came out a little to salty to me.  Next time I will just stick to the recipe with no additions.

Good base recipe. I have never tried cream of mushroom for a roast. You really cant tell its cream of mushroom soup. I marinated the roast overnight in red wine, the seasoning, garlic, and some herbes de provence. Browned it in very hot oil first thing in the morning. When I added everything to the crockpot I also added the marinade for added flavor. It ended up thinning out the gravy so next time I will coat the roast in flour after marinading but before browning. This was my first time browning a roast before putting it in the slow cooker. It makes a difference if you have the time! Cooked it on high 2 hrs then low 4 hrs. I am going to add the leftover meat to spaghetti sauce.

Loved it!  I used the dry onion and mushroom soup and left out the veggies.  When the roast was done, I cooked wide egg noodles, pulled the meat apart, and mixed it all together for a beef and noodle fest!  My kids loved it!

this was my favourite thing i've ever made in my slow cooker!!  so tender and flavourful!  the only change i made was after the meat and veg were done, i put them in a casserole with a lid to keep warm, then i felt the gravy needed a beef bouillon cube for flavour and some corn starch in water to thicken it up.  so awesome and it made a ton of gravy - enough for leftovers the next night!!

came out great although I did make a couple changes bc I didnt have all ingredients on hand, such as I used spinach dip mix instead of onion dip mix and then added dried onion.  Came out great.  The whole family loved it!

This was a big hit with the family. Based on reviews that said it needed liquid I added 1/2 cup of veg stock. That was NOT needed. There was way too much juice in the bottom of the crock pot after. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

This was really good and really easy to make. The one fault I had with it (and it was my own) was I added some water to thin the soup.. and it was just too much. Oops! I think next time I will stick to a 1:1 ratio of soup to water. But other then that excellent! I used Campbell's cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic as the soup! No left overs. And this is the first pot roast I have ever made!!

I made this yesterday.  Was in the crockpot all day while I was at work.  The whole house smelled AMAZING when I walked in from work.  The meat was so tender you could use a fork to cut through it.  The seasoning was great with the Campbell's soup and dry onion soup mix.  I even added a small amount of Worcestershire sauce to the meat for some extra zing.  It was great!

This has turned out extremely well for me. The inexpensive beef bottom round roast is hard to get tender(it is, after all, the least tender of all roast cuts, also mediocre flavor), yet I was able to do it with this recipe. I did add some liquid ( this is necessary) and kept turning the roast over every few hours and basting it (for about 10) on low, because low and slow is the best way to get a tough cut tender.  It was delicious and extremely tender, better than a more expensive cut of meat to my surprise!

This was absolutely fantastic! I didn't need the veggies since I had alternative plans but I did slice up a medium onion and cooked on high for 5 1/2 hours and it was so moist and the gravy was delicious!!!! I highly recommend this recipe!

This is my favorite way to cook and eat pot roast. It does however need a standard can of beef broth added to the recipe to have enough liquid for the roast to sit in and cook to become fork tender and then it is 5 stars! The gravy this recipe makes is incredible ... rich and delicious. I like a thicker gravy and prefer to thicken mine with a little cornstarch before serving. I used a bottom round roast and like to cut with the grain so it shreds. Leftovers make an excellant open faced hot sandwich.

This is an old recipe and it works!  Really good....I use about a quarter package of the onion soup mix since I find it too strong.  It can be made with or without the vegetables........easy and delicious.

This was delicious!  For you people who think it's a fatty cut of meat, try trimming the fat off the meat before putting in the oven.

I added some extra veggies for me.  But my teenagers (I feed 3) devoured them along with the meat.  I left this in the crockpot with a note NOT to touch it.  I wanted the meat to steam.  I thought they were going to eat me when I walked in from work.  They decided it was cruel and unusual punishment to make them smell it all day and not be able to eat it. LOL  Once I gave the OK...4lbs of beef was gone in a flash.  I was worried about not adding liquid, but I had a whole pot of wonderful veggie and beef juice.  A keeper in my house.  THANKS

I've been making a recipe like this for years but mine calls for Golden Mushroom instead of regular Mushroom and a can of French Onion soup instead of the dry onion soup mix.  I always had a lot of gravy ... in fact more than enough to sop up with biscuits.  I think the next time I make this I'll try regular Mushroom soup and the dry onion but I'll probably add a little water to the recipe.  This makes the house smell sooooo wonderful.  Yum!

I came across this recipe one day the only thing I do different is I bake the potatoes and carrots seperate, I will never make roast any other way then this one, the roast stays nice and juicy and you dont have to make gravy. Even my picky 12 year old eats this!

This is almost my Jewish Mother's recipe and by definition, Jewish mother's MUST make a great pot roast!. She uses Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup, a package of dry onion soup mix and 1 can of water. Then add whatever veggies/potatoes you have on hand. I usually use a rump roast. Sear the meat 1st on the cook top in a bit of oil and then bake it in a covered casserole for 3 hours at 325 degrees. It is always delicious.

The pot roast was delicious!  I added fresh mushrooms and onions, which really added some flavor.  I also seasoned the meat with seasoning salt before putting it in the crock pot.

Love this recipe.  Its great just as written, though I do opt for the lower sodium mushroom soup.  I have also started adding some red wine and a tsp of herbs de province.  Absolutely delish, the gravy is so savory. Boyfriend loves it over egg noodles, string beans on the side. This is a favorite go-to recipe that I've served to company for a home cooked meal.

Delicious!!! We used a 2.3 pound roast, cooked for 6.5 hours on low in the crock pot, and only used HALF a packet of the onion soup mix with half an onion to still get the flavor without the salt. So, so good. We'll definitely eat this again!

Tasty and simple! This recipe was so easy I almost forgot I had set my slow cooker up with this recipe in the morning. After cooking for 9 hours, the meat was nearly falling apart and both the meat and veggies absorbed the seasoning wonderfully. I will definitely add this to my regular recipe stock.

Good and easy...pretty basic pot roast....nice creamy gravy. I did not add veggies to this because I made Zucchini and Potato Bake from this site as a side. Thanks!

this was pretty good.  let it cook for 7 hrs on low and next time will try for 6.5 hours on low because meat gets tough and a little overcooked.  8-9 hrs is too long.  no need to add water, you will have plenty of juices as it cooks.

Used this recipe for a small moose roast. The only thing I changed was to cut down the amount of onion soup mix that I added, and used the onion/ garlic mix instead. Delicious and tender. Great recipe!

This was not one of my family favorites.  I think it had more to do with the cut of meat.  It was very fatty.  The ingredients were also lacking something.  Maybe onion or garlic.

I have been making this recipe for years!  Everyone loves it.  I do change it a bit.  I don't put carrots or potatoes in the crock-pot.  I add 1/2 cup of white wine to the soup mix which gives it a little more liquid and a wonderful flavor.  1/2 hour before the roast is ready I add 8oz of sliced portobello mushrooms to the pot and when finished serve over egg noodles! Delish!

This recipe is a great base!  I've made it three times so far and it's gotten better every time. This is what I found out: It definitely does need at least a half a can of beef broth to cook in (a whole can works best). I followed another reviewer's advice and used McCormick's Montreal Steak mix on the meat first, and this gave it just the right kick (not spicy, but flavorful).  I also followed another reviewer's advice and added small golden potatoes and celery. Another tip would be to buy the low salt version of everything, since the extra salt is not needed.  My finicky husband and all my friends love it!

Wonderful and unbelievably easy! This was the first roast I've ever made. I did as some other advised in their reviews and added a little extra cream of mushroom soup, over the roast. Also added celery and onion on top of the roast, and used whole baby carrots. Assembled within 15 mins before heading out to work. My boyfriend, the 4 yr old, and 9 yr old all gave this a big thumbs up! My 4 yr old even ate the carrots, which he picks out of EVERYTHING else.

Wow... so much flavor and the tenderness of the meat is perfect. Although since I did not have a slow cooker, I tried cooking it on a pressure cooker, which cooked much faster. Ultimately one of the best Pot Roast. Definitely will consider making this recipe for my family more often. Thank you.

I've used this recipe for a while now, after having been passed it from my mother-in-law.  It is fantastic!  It is so easy you can actually just dump everything into the slowcooker on your way out the door, and when you get back it's hard to believe how delicious a meal you have for hardly any effort!  It's a favorite of my girls and husband, and I get begged to make it at least once a week when it's cold!

I broke in my 4-quart crock pot with this recipe and it was absolutely delicious! The roast was a bit over 3 lbs. so I used two cans of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom and 1.5 pouches of the online soup mix for the gravy. I also seared the roast with vegetable oil, salt and seasoned pepper before tossing it in the crock pot. My family raved about the unbelievable flavor and tenderness of the meat. Definitely a "do-over!"

I won't make again.  I made followed the recipe exactly,I actually added salt and pepper - and still wasn't a fan.  The beef wasn't as tender as I had hoped, and it was stringy.  I had to beg my husband to eat the leftovers.

Wow, great flavor! I changed the cream of mushroom to a simple cream sauce only because my family doesn't eat mushrooms. I would suggest waiting to put the carrots and potatoes in until later. I put them in at the same time as the meat and they were done within 2 hours, the meat still needed cooking. That's just my opinion. The recipe is wonderful and everyone loved it!

I have made this many times over the last year and it has become a must in our dinner menu rotation .  I usually double it as we have a family of 7 and 3 of those are beef trucks!  I never have leftovers...A++++ from our family!

So I changed this up maybe a little. I added a whole onion, a few stalks of celery, a pinch of garlic, a tablespoon of minced fresh parsley & a can worth of low-sodium beef broth (the cream of mushroom can)because my in my experience, slow cookers need liquid to do their job. I didn't use Campbell's brand onion soup mix but what I have on hand. Cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours. I don't generally like pot roast but this was pretty good.... my youngest son absolutely loved this and asked why I don't make pot roast more often. :)

This is a classic 1950's recipe. My mom's whole cuisine was based on cream of mushroom soup and Lipton's dried onion soup.  And she was a darn good cook!  Meatloaf, pot roast, chicken...all good.

I have made this a hundred times and it is alays delicious.  I only add a 1/4 cup of beef broth and I put a couple tablespoons of catsup on top of the roast.  Also, I add celery and garlic powder and cook the veggies separately.

This was awesome. I made it exactly as the instructions specified and at the end, I served a lovely pot roast coated with a savory, easy gravy that went well with the veggies too. My husband adores this pot roast recipe and really cant be convinced to eat any other. 2 thumbs up!

Absolute fantastic 
I did change the recipe a little though. Instead on 1 can cream of mushroom soup i used two. 
Also rubbed the roast down with some liquid smoke and spices. (Salt,Pepper,Basil,Paprika,Garlic and Onion)  Browned the roast in a pan on all sides to make sure all the flavor and juices will stay in the meat. 
I didn't have any onion soup mix in the house and used the ranch dressing mix i had instead. 
It was so delicious and perfect i could have eaten the whole roast myself. lol

turned out ok...my roast was done in 5 hours . vegetables were mushy and no one ate those. Meat was tender and flavourful. Easy to make if in a pinch but will skip the vegetables mext time.

Very tasty. The meat was very tender and the gravy was excellent. The simplicity of this recipe can't be beat, although I like the way the veggies turn out in the oven a little better, thus the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. I used the high setting on my crock pot and cooked for 5 hours. I did add about 3/4 C of water upon hubby's suggestion.

Delicious.  As many said you should add more liquid.. 1 to 1.5 soup cans full of water and a bullion cube, or the same of beef broth will work wonderfully.  I add-lib'd and added some onion, red pepper, and garlic

This is my first time to make pot roast.  This recipe was great.  I followed recipe and added a few ingredients. (I floured and seasoned all sides and browned in 1/4c. vegetable oil) 1 can beef stock, 2 tablespoons garlic, and then took some of the oil that i browned the roast in and added to my mixture. I was impressed with my own cooking as well as friends and family!!

I give this pot roast 5 stars. It is so easy.  And it's amazing how much gravy it has.  I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking it would be dry, being the can of cream soup is the only liquid..... but after slow cooking for 8 hours, the crock pot was filled to the brim with delicious gravy!

First time ever making a pot roast. Followed the recipe along with 1 cup of water added. This was better than any pot roast i have had in 31 years!! My husband loved it, which was a suprise because he is very picky with his meat. I will continue to use this recipe everytime i make the pot roast!!

Excellent busy day recipe.  I had two sheet cakes to make, so I put this in the crock pot first, then worked all day on the cakes.  At suppertime, all I had to do was throw a salad together and I fed 5 people!  Everyone loved it!!!

I couldn't believe how this roast turned out!  It was so moist & tender!  My husband had some left-overs the next day & he said he was surprised that it was still as moist as it was the day I made it.  I did add a can of beef broth & a couple of beef bouillon cubes.  I also added a little water as well. I used onion mushroom soup mix & added in a can of sliced mushrooms as well.  I used a whole bag of baby carrots.  It was superb & I will most definitely make this again!

WOW! Campbell's you did it again! Another GREAT recipe! My hubby hates mushrooms and onions and he said this was better than mine! LOL. The only thing different I did was sear the meat before I put it in. A++ Recipe! Thanks! (and NO, I didnt add extra liquid and stuff like other people had said to, you don't need it!)

The left overs also make a great beef soup. Use the left over meat, add more veggies and use the leftover gravy in the soup. Very savory.

For the most part I followed the recipe. Then I added a couple of simple changes that I thought improved it a bit..First I browned the pot roast in olive oil with garlic and Thyme.  Secondly I added carrots and an onion about half way through point.  Then I mashed the potatoes and used the juices in the crock pot for gravy....It was a fantastic meal on a cold winters day!

My husband always hated pot roast so I haven't made it in years.  He loved this one!!!  I made it just as it said and didn't add anything extra.  It smelled so wonderful all day!  He even asked for left overs the next day! 5 star Winner Dinner!!

My family loved this recipe. I cooked it as written but used others advice and cooked the potatoes wrapped in foil placed on top of the roast. They were fork tender.

I will make this recipe again.

My favorite way to have a roast. I have never tasted a better roast! I usually use a rump roast. I like it best in my Dutch oven baked in the oven but sometimes that’s not a option. I have never had trouble with over cooked veggies but then I leave them on the large side. My only complaint is how good it makes my house smell hours before it’s ready, the family starts looking like zombies wanting to eat it raw ??

This was so absolutely delicious!!! I'm not a huge pot roast fan, but I can't wait to make this again. Next time I will use 2 cans of cream/mushroom to make more gravy. This was a huge hit at my house!!

I am a lover of seasonings and much flavor.  I added several peppercorns, one can of Campbell's Roasted Garlic Mushroom Soup, two bay leaves, one can of water, and one packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.

Very good, especially considering the amount of effort involved (very little)! I just used a bag of baby carrots... put carrots and potatoes in crockpot first, then coated meat with the soup mixture and set on top. Cooked for about 6-7 hours (probably couldve cooked another hour).  I dont feel like it needed any additional liquid as others have stated. Served with buttermilk biscuits as suggested. Delicious, will definitely make again!!

Great flavor. I dredged roast in flour, salt and pepper before browning then  added 1/2c red wine and celery to slow cooker. Will make again with a leaner cut of meat.

Had a 2.5 lb. pot roast and decided to make this because it was fast and easy to prepare.  It took 6.5 hours on LOW to cook and I followed the recipe exactly as written, however, I did rub salt, pepper and garlic powder on the meat on both sides.  I didn't need any extra liquid, it made its own juice which was delicious to spoon over the meat and veggies.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting,

Great recipe. But don't leave out an important step.  Dust the meat in mixture of flour,salt and pepper and brown well in bacon grease or oil.  Then put it in the crock OT.  This step is key to a good gravy, enhanced flavor and tender meat.

This recipe was delicious! It was finished in 7 1/2 hours and the meat just fell apart. As most others did, I added a second can of cream of mushroom soup. I also put the potatoes and carrots wrapped in foil on top until it only had two hours left and then mixed them in for the remaining time. They weren't too mushy but they were just soft enough. We will most definitely be making this again!

Have made this with bottom round roast and chuck both came out great. I don't use the dry onion soup instead I use one large yellow onion and for extra liquid a second can of mushroom soup. So easy for a meal that tastes so good!

My mother in law made this one day when we were visiting and it was fantastic.  I tried to change it and did double the soup and double the onion( for a 4lb roast) because I felt it wasn't enough.  It ended up cooking for 16 hours and it still was terrible!  Trying again today with the exact recipie.  Well almost....i might add like a half of cup of water though, because to me, it doesn't look like that much liquid with the roast on top of the potatoes and carrots. .

You can easily reduce the saltiness by using sodium free beef bouillon (powder)  and a couple tablespoons of dried onion (or fresh) in place of the onion soup mix.  I do this all the time and you still get great flavor, but about 1/2 the sodium. This beef can also be cooked in the oven...wrap beef and soup tightly in foil and cook on low for several hours.

Very good! Easy to make and turned out perfectly! We decided to add only half of the onion soup mix and it turned out well. We used the drippings to make gravy to go with some mashed potatoes. Thank you for the great recipe. :)

Delicious!  My children LOVE this for dinner.  Definitely easy to prepare and spectacularly delicious and nutritious when served with a simple green salad.

One star for easy and one for being edible. No stars for taste. I didn't  like it at all, but my husband  said It wasn't  too bad. I'm  not even sure I would want to  experiment for a better taste. I'm  going back to my old recipe.

This was really good and easy. The only change I made was replacing the potatoes with a quartered onion for a little extra flavor and then we ate it with mashed potatoes. Yum!

My family absolutely loved this.  The meat was very tender, tasty and loved the gravy.  I rubbed the meat with salt,pepper and garlic powder before searing it.  I cut an onion and lined the bottom of the crockpot before putting the seared roast in with 2 cans cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 package of onion soup mix.  I did not need to add any other liquid and it created awesome gravy. I cut potatoes in about 1 inch squares and added them about 2 hours before dinner.

Stir a TB butter to the juices just before serving hot. Also I add some fresh mushrooms to the rest of the pot at the start.

I have been making this for years but I use Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup.  It is much better on a pot roast.  DREGINEK is right about adding water.

My family loved this!  I did sear the roast before transferring to slow cooker.  Also, added 1 can of beef broth to the recipe.  Once roast was done, I used remaining liquid to make a gravy.

GOOD STUFF!  Made us all :)         Used fingerling potatoes, mini carrots, added a large chopped yellow onion, beefy-onion soup mix, and a couple celery stalks at the very top of it all (removed celery after cooking)...very tasty and super easy.

We added a cup of beef broth & used a recipe I found, to make the onion soup mix.  This was really good & we didn't have to thicken up the sauce to make gravy.  We will definitely be making this again.

This was very good however the meat was tough.  I cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours.  Not sure if I accidentally chose the wrong cut of roast or if it's the cooking time that created the tough texture.  I did sear the outside of the meat on the stove as many others suggested and added Montreal Steak Seasoning.

this was ok, a nice basic but they left out the important part of browning the meat prior to putting it in. that's the only thing i can figure out as to why this turned out so darn dry. ive had better.

I also have been making this for years.  The only change I have made is I prefer Campbells Golden Mushroom Soup.  The Golden Mushroom soup gives it a much more beefy taste and the gravy it makes is absolutly yummy!

Just had this tonight!  It was excellent!  I added about a 1/4 cup water and a few onions.  I also seasoned the meat a little.  I only made a 1.5lb roast and coooked on low for about 6 hours.  It was very tender and juicy.  Will make again!

I added a cup of beef broth like some of the other reviewers suggested but it was just too much liquid.  Everything turned out really good but I think next time I would add only a fraction of that liquid.  Or add it slowly throughout the day.  Overall very good and easy recipe.

My complaints are in regards to the gravy.  I was unsure about using cream of mushroom but went ahead and made the recipe as instructed the only change was I added some celery and a little water (water was unneccessary).  It wasn't a beefy thick gravy, it was murky and I had to doctor it up with sugar, salt, and pepper to make it taste decent.  There is actually a recipe on the Lipton Soup Mix that I'd try, basically this recipe sans the cream of mushroom.  Chuck is always good so no complaints about the roast itself.  In regards to the people who had to add liquid, I believe it's probably because you don't have a tight enough fitting lid, because the roast itself created A LOT of juices, no additional liquid required at all...

Didn't seem like enough liquid at first, but turned out ok.  Roast was a little dry, perhaps due to the low level of liquid.  If possible, re-baste the roast from time to time, or add additional liquid to keep everything moist (I'll try beef broth next time).

It was an okay recipe, but I could tell it was going to be a little bland so I added two beef bullion cubes, a dash of bbq sauce, and some steak house grinder and it was good. So if you follow the recipe its going to be a bland.
