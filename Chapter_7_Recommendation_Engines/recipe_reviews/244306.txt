I used the right ingredients, but mine were fresh except for the tomatoes.  I sauteed the onions and potatoes together, so when the other ingredients were added, everything only cooked a few more minutes.  My chocolate mint really came out in this, and I loved it!  DH didn't notice there was mint in the dish!  Great idea!
