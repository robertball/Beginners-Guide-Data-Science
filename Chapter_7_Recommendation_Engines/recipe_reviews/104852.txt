Followed this recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS! im of indian heritage but had never made anything with eggplant before..but my husband asked me to make this...was happy to find the recipe here and he was raving about the taste. so that is proof that it was good-cause he's a good cook himself. tastes best with some fresh whole wheat chappatis and so healthy too! yum! thanks!

I saved the dish eventually, but I had to doctor it soo much, it wasn't recognizable from the original recipe.   Sorry, but I'll find another recipe next time.

This was such a hit with my boyfriend that his eyes lit up at the first bite! I decreased the amount of oil and substituted 1 tsp of ground mustard (added with the other spices) for the seeds. I also only had about half of the garam masala and caraway seeds on hand. But it was delicious anyway!!

Loved it! I used the small Indian eggplants. I served this to Indian guests and was told that the flavor tasted very authentic. Try it!

This recipe has great flavors, but the eggplant gets very squishy, giving the dish a weird texture.  We're having trouble getting ourselves to eat the leftovers.

Not good at all.  I was leary about using the soy sauce as I have never seen it in an Indian or Pakistani dish before, but made it as written.  Perhaps without the soy sauce it would be good, but the soy sauce really didn't go with it.

Great dish! I didn't have mustard seeds or caraway seeds at hand, but it still turned out great. Will definitely make it again, perhaps without potatoes.
