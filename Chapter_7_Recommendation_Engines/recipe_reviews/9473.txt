SUPERB !!  We have two evening services at our church on Christmas eve, and I made this for my fellow choir members to sooth our throats between services. It was a tremendous hit, and I've been advised to make it part of our tradition.  I was afraid it would make too much, but every bit was GONE.
NB...this recipe makes 2 gallons

Loved Loved Loved It. I used ground ginger due to the cost of crystalized ginger. Also used apple juice due to availability.I used 64 ouces of apple juice and 1 teaspoon each of ground ginger and nutmeg about 1 1/2 tablespoons of whole cloves and substituted brown sugar for white. I also adjusted the juices accordingly using 3 cups of Orange Juice and 3/4 c lemon juice, 3 cinnamon sticks.

I have been making this German favorite for over 30 years and I love it! The only thing I do differently is I cut the lemon juice to just one cup instead of two. I also make sure to use Apple CIDER not Apple juice. Apple Cider gives it a richer flavor and it holds up when heated better. Love the way my home smells when I make this during the holidays. Don't forget to try it with your favorite rum or brandy for a nice night cap. :)

Overall, very good wassail! I've made this a couple of time and I find the lemon juice to be overpowering. I now decrease the amount of lemon juice and add pomagrante juice. It gives a nice kick to the flavor.  I also use ground ginger instead of crystallized and it works just fine.

It was a good recipe but I think that the combination of the lemon & the orange make it too bitter.

Very good!  This is almost exactly like my favorite Wassail, the only difference being the omission of cardamom in this recipe.  I toss in a few whole green cardamom pods with the other spices. (Sorry for being inexact - the number depends on the amount of Wassail and the size and freshness of the pods... and personal taste.  Try 1 or 2 if you are not accustomed to the flavor of cardamom.) 
DO use real oranges and lemons (not juice concentrates) - the fresh juices make all the difference in the world.  Worth the work of all of that squeezing :-)

Very tasty and what an aroma!  Makes a ton...next time I will make less and also use less sugar - I found the natural sugars in the cider, oj and lemon juice to be very sweet, so adding all that additional sugar was too much.  But a very tasty combination of flavors.  This definitely makes my holiday drink list.

I've made this for Christmas parties, and folks really like it.  It's delicious and so nice, because it's a very warm punch when it's cold outside!  I just keep it simmering on the stove during a party.

A holiday hit!  Both church and work parties loved this.  Good with a bit of rum, too!

This is SO good. It's worth making for the aroma alone! (The house smells DIVINE!) I halved the recipe but used 6 cinnamon sticks. Also, I used ground ginger instead of crystallized. I'm going to make this again for Christmas Eve (and add a splash of spicy rum!!). Great recipe, Leslie!

Wow, this is good.  Definitely worth the time it takes to make it -- and pretty simple, too.  The recipe as it is makes just a tad over two gallons; it's so good, though, that we didn't have any problem finishing it off.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it! My dad must have gone back three or four times! I will definitely make it again next year.

I served this as the non-alcholic drink at my Christmas party last night and it was well received. I will make this again, but I would not put quite as much sugar in it. It was just a little too sweet, the cider is sweet and the orange juice is sweet so the ammount of sugar was a bit too much, maybe 1 cup less would be good. You could always add more when you're heating it if you thought it needed it.

Yum! I added a few cardamom seeds to a cheese cloth with the other spices and there was none left.

This is some top freakin shelf wassail. Made as directed with one exception--I used sliced fresh ginger root instead of the crystallized stuff.  It was neither too sour nor too sweet and all the people complaining are wrong.
