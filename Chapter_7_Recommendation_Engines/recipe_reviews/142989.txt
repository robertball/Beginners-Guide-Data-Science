I made just a couple of tweaks and this was really good. I added some minced onion and a little salt to the water when I cooked the rice. I toasted the slivered almonds in a dry skillet until they were browned before I added them to the cooked rice with the remaining ingredients. It made a nice change from plain rice.

I loved the recipe for both the final result and for the easy prep.  In my book it's a keeper and it goes well with "Curry Grilled Chicken" (another quick and easy recipe).

This was very good (with the changes/additions I made). I have made it with both jasmine rice and basmati rice. I used chicken broth to cook the rice in, add fresh garlic a little ginger and some cilantro to the dish. Very good!

Totally fantastic!  I use toasted almond slivers.  The family loves this.  It goes great with orange chicken.  This is real keeper.

Well I modified the recipe also, adding extra slivered almonds, and for the fruit I used a combination of golden raisins, dried cranberries and dried goji berries to equal one cup total. 
It was a little bland to my taste, so I added some McKay's Chicken seasoning, and then the flavor popped! Am thinking of also adding some finely chopped celery to add more flavor and texture. This will be a favorite for sure!

This dish looked exotic but lacked flavor. I should have followed previous reviews to toast the almonds and add other ingredients.

Easy and tasty. I made it without the onions. It doesn't have any oil or butter, so it is low-fat. Next time I will toast the almonds or use pecans or walnuts.

Hubby & I both liked this recipe, but I found the orange zest overpowering.  I made it as written but I toasted the almonds before adding to the rice.  Next time I'll reduce the the orange zest by half.  It's a nice change from plain rice and the flavor was interesting -in a GOOD way!  It's definitely a recipe you can play with.

I just got done making this and had a few changes. I used goji berries and cranzins as well as fresh reinder cherry's. I used chicken broth and the juice of the orange that we are using the skin for, I roasted my almonds but also added chopped pecans. A little dash of grated lemon rind and some juice at the end to freshen it up. Very tasty!.
