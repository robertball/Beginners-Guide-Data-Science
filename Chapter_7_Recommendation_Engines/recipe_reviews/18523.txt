This is just like the "Schlotsky" bread! I made it as dough in my bread machine & then formed into rolls, and baked in the oven.  These are great! My thanks to Chris for sharing the recipe. The only thing is, they disappeared too quickly - will have to double the batch!

These were a good, basic roll. I really liked the yeast-y flavor. A couple notes: 1.) grease your bowls well; my rolls really stuck to my soup bowls. 2.) in hindsight, I don't know if it was worth the effort of using 6 separate soup bowls. It does make the size of the rolls nice and large, but I think a muffin pan would be much easier. Overall good recipe, though- thanks!
