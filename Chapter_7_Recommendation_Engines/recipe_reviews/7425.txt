I made this cake twice yesterday.  The 1st time, I followed all directions and found the cake dry and bland.  Also, there were chocolate swirls in the baked cake even though I mixed the cocoa/food coloring paste well and beat the paste thoroughly into the shortening/sugar/egg mixture. The frosting was nice--I hadn't tried that before and liked it.  The 2nd time, I modifed the recipe based on a suggestion of another reviewer.  I substituted 1 cup oil for 1/2 cup shortening and 2 cups sugar for 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Also, I added 1-2 extra tablespoons of cocoa powder.  What a difference!  The cake was very moist with a stronger flavor (more traditional).  The color was gorgeous.  I split the layers and frosted with a double batch of cream cheese frosting.  Yummy! Everyone went nuts over the 2nd cake.  I have a small dessert business and I received 2 orders (for the holidays)for the 2nd version of the cake after friends/clients tasted it.  Thanks for the suggestions.

I'm astonished and amazed to find an  red velvet cake that actually uses the CORRECT frosting!!!  Not sure why so many think that "cream cheese frosting" belongs on a red velvet cake.  I'm so delighted that this cake has no cream cheese frosting -sorry but cream cheese frosting is NOT the traditional frosting on red velvet cake.  Kudos to you for posting a recipe that is *Almost* like my family recipe, ours calls for 3 Tbsp of cocoa, and no vinegar. The vinegar is un-necessary, especially when the recipe contains buttermilk.

I made this cake with the changes other reviewers recommended, and it was fantastic!  I used one cup of oil instead of the shortening, two cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups, and an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder.  Also, I only used 1 ounce of food color because that's all I had and it gave it a nice red color.  I think 2 ounces would be overkill.  I did make the mistake, though, of sifting the cocoa powder together with the flour, and the food dye with the buttermilk, thinking it made more sense to do it that way, but I ended up with some brown swirls.  
The second time I made this, I did everything except I made the cocoa powder and food color into a paste like you're supposed to and the color turned out an even red color.  Also, the second time I made it into cupcakes and baked them at 325 degrees for about 25 min.  The frosting is to die for!  I'll be using that on most every cake from now on!  Thanks for a great recipe and all the reviewers' suggestions.

If you don't have buttermilk on hand, mix 1T vinegar with 1C milk, allow it to set for about 5 minutes. This will allow it to curdle to the point where it is sour in a manner similar to buttermilk, and you can EASILY use THIS as a substitute.

I have this recipe that was deemed "original" from a newspaper clipping almost 40 years ago!  This recipe is identical and it is wonderful!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  And please keep trying on the icing.  It is wonderful!  It must be cold, as stated, and to be sure that it isn't grainy, I used powdered sugar instead of granulated.  I cut the 2 layers of cake (9") in half, and the 4 "layers" were beautiful.  (I also doubled the icing recipe and had more than enough).  Absolutely excellent!

This is a wonderful traditional Red Velvet Cake recipe and the frosting puts it over the top.   Having read through the comments I think this recipe is problematic because people have made modifications that effect the chemistry of the cake.   RV cake gets it's rich red color from the baking soda reacting with the Ducth processed cocoa. Vinegar and buttermilk are the acidic ingredients that are the catalyst for the b. Soda. This leavening reaction creates CO2, which effects the cakes volume, along with the taste, texture and color.  Substituting baking  powder can cause the cake to be crumbly,  overbrown and bitter.  It's also not recommended to exchange solid fats - shortening with liquid oils. Solid fats when beaten with sugar hold air bubbles making the cake moist.. Oils don't hold the air bubbles this makes the cake dense and dry. The baker's rule only substitute like for like. If you don't want to use shortening then you can sub butter so long as the fat content is at least 80%. For 1/2 cup shortening sub 1/2 cup butter+1  tbsp of water.  Also when greasing the pans it's best to use shortening, butter or oils can be absorbed into the batter as the cake bakes causing it to stick to the pan.

I really like this cake but only gave it four stars because of all the modifications I had to make.  I took other reviewers' advice and made the following changes:  used 4 tbsp. cocoa which I added to the 1 cup oil instead of shortening; increased sugar to 2 cups; only used 1 oz. of red food coloring which I added to the buttermilk (believe me, it was plenty and my cake was bright red); upped the vanilla to 1.5 tsp and upped the vinegar to 1 tbsp.  I did not use the frosting recipe because I wanted a cream cheese frosting and even though this one is advertised as cream cheese, it does not contain any.  Instead, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was divine (with modifications).  Thanks for a good bare bones recipe but do make modifications before trying it yourself!

This is the absolute worst cake recipe I have ever tried in my 3 years of cake baking.  Not only was the cake batter thick, but the whole mess was overwhelmed by the cocoa taste.  The so called frosting was a soupy butter, milky sugar-filled slop of pure liquid.  I reccomend this recipe to no one.  I waster two batches worth of ingredients on it.  Both time i followed the instructions exactly.  If you're thinking about making a red velvet cake this is not a recipe for it.

Very Yummy.  And I am not much of a chocolate fan. I added the one cup oil, instead of the shortening.  I also added 2 cups sugar, total. And increased cocoa to 4 TBSPs. I didn't make a cocoa food coloring paste.  I added the food coloring to the buttermilk and the cocoa to the butter sugar mixture.  The color was beautiful, no swirls, and the flavor was amazing. I used a store bought vanilla frosting.  This is one of my favorite cakes.  I think next time I will use 1 TBSP of vinegar, as most other redvelvet cakes call for that amount, even the other one by Eleanor Johnson (who did this recipie too.)

Overall, this recipe gets more points for appearance than for flavor.

This cake tastes and looks a lot better if you refrigerate it for several hours before serving it.  Before refrigeration, the frosting has the consistency and appearance of runny cottage cheese, but afterwards, it has a nice firm, creamy texture.

I found the chocolate flavor to be too subtle, even after doubling the amount of cocoa.  8 tablespoons would probably give it a nicer flavor.

Finally, I couldn't bring myself to dump two 1-ounce jars of red food coloring into my cake.  I used only half an ounce and the cake still turned out bright red.

Excellent cake with a few modifications.  I used 1/2 cup cocoa.  My Red Velvet Cake Roll uses 1/4 cup cocoa for 3/4 cup flour so I knew this cake was going to take way more than 2 tablespoons.  Increased oil to 3/4 cup.  Also be aware of the type of cocoa that you are using.  I learned the hard way after ruining several Red Velvet Cakes and 6 Red Velvet Cake Rolls.  If you are using Dutch processed cocoa be sure to replace the baking soda with baking powder.  It has something to do with the fact that the acid is removed from the Dutch processed.  If you are using regular unsweetened cocoa you can use the baking soda.  None of the recipes I found online or in cook books make this distinction in the recipe directions.  Once I started using the baking powder with the Dutch processed cocoa, my problems disappeared and the end result was perfect.

4 stars as written, 5 with a slight modification. Like many others, the only change I made was to add 1T of cocoa powder, and substitute veg oil for the shortening.  A couple of notes: First, these rise very high. Fill cupcake tins halfway and the cupcake will still rise slightly over the top. Second, don't delete the vinegar, as many people seem to do for fear of a strange taste. The vinegar does not affect flavor. The acid in the vinegar's reacts with the baking soda in a way that brings out a distinct red color in the cocoa.  That's its purpose.  Third, be sure to mix the cocoa paste and food dye well, and be sure to mix this paste with the flour well.  If you don't, you will have a dessert with streaks of cocoa which still tastes great, but isn't as pretty as a dessert with uniform red throughout.  Four, this recipe made 60 mini cupcakes.

I've modified this recipe quite a bit to where it's entirely a different recipe at this point, but this was the basis of my red velvet cake that people frequently tell me is the best they've ever tried.  Most importantly, people tell me that the frosting is divine, and just perfect for the cake.  Anyone who's choosing the cream cheese frosting over the butter roux is not making the frosting properly.  Here's how I adjusted the frosting, follow the instructions (modifications) exactly:  Increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and grind it down in a blender until it's powdery - this will remove the grainy texture.  When adding the flour to the milk, make sure you whisk CONSTANTLY, and when it says to wait until the roux thickens, that means you must wait until it becomes nearly solid.  It should hold its form for several seconds without melting into itself again.  Instead of waiting for this to cool on its own, put this mixture into a stand mixer while it's hot and beat with the paddle attachment until it cools to room temperature, this prevents lumps.  At this point, add the softened butter gradually until it's uniformly mixed, and then gradually add the finely ground sugar and vanilla extract (and for special occasions, vanilla bean).  Switch to the whisk attachment and mix at the highest speed for nearly 10 minutes, the frosting should be pure white (it will take a while) and fluffy at this point and ready to spread.  Trust me, the effort is well worth it on the frosting.

The BEST red velvet cake! I made this cake using the substitutions everyone had suggested (3 tbl cocoa powder instead of 2 tbls, 1 oz red food coloring not 2 oz, 1 cup oil for 1/2 cup shortening, 2 cups white sugar not 1 1/2 cups, and a tablespoon white vinegar). I did not make the frosting, so I can't rate that, but the cake is amazing! Rich, moist with the perfect combination of vanilla and cocoa as a proper red velvet should. I made this with red, white, and blue fondant for the 4th of July and it was a total hit at the bbq. This recipe is a keeper!

I am giving 5 stars for the texture alone. This cake is so light and fluffy it's unreal. I've never had a red velvet cake this fluffy before. They are usually dense cakes. The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of the shortning and I didn't add all of the food coloring (couldn't bring myself to do it) It still has a nice color but it's not clown red. This is going to be my new go recipe for red velvet. If you feel that the cake comes out too dry it means your most likely overbaking it. If you want to up the moisture a bit you can also add an extra egg yolk to the mix.

In all fairness, I didn't use the cake recipe but rather the frosting recipe. My curiousity got the best of me so I tested it before frosting my red velvet cake. I actually was surprised that I prefer this frosting over the usual cream cheese frosting! I think the trick is to allow time for the flour/milk mixture to reach the consistency of mashed potatoes over low heat while stirring and smoothing out any lumps. I actually chilled it after cooking to make the mixture cold. I creamed softened-not hard butter- with powdered sugar and vanilla thoroughly and added the flour mixture. I beat it for 5 more minutes. Turned out PERFECT! I will use this on my red velvet cake from now on. The strawberries compliment this tasty frosting nicely! **I used the Red Velvet Cake recipe on dianasdesserts.com

I made this recipe for a Valentine's Day party and it got rave reviews.  I made the following modifications: (4T cocoa, 1 oz food coloring, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 C oil, 2 C sugar & 1 T vinegar).  Also, I used a 9" x 13" pan.  The other slight change I made was for the frosting.  I beat the sugar and butter for 15 minutes (a suggestion from another cookbook).  The frosting was as good as the best bakery butter cream frosting!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be making this again.

Okay, I'm giving this a 4 star rating because I altered the recipe like most people seem to have done on here.  I used 4 T cocoa powder, 1 oz. food coloring, 1 c. oil, and 2 c. sugar.  I also didn't have buttermilk on hand so I soured milk using white vinegar.  Other than altering the ingredient list, I followed the instructions exactly as written.  The cake turned out wonderfully and everyone commented on how good it was.  Some of the reviewers on here commented on the difficult time they had with the frosting.  It is a more complex frosting to make, BUT it is totally worth it.  Some frosting tips:  let the milk and flour mixture cook long enough for it to get to nice and thick.  Once it is thick, be sure to let the mixture cool COMPLETELY (I stuck mine in the fridge for a bit).  For the final step, be sure to let everything whip for several minutes.  If it doesn't whip long enough, the sugar granules will remain in the frosting and it will be crunchy and gross.  I used the beater attachment on my KitchenAid to do this, and everything turned out really well.  If you follow those tips you shouldn't have an issue with the frosting.  I really enjoyed the frosting, but my brother likes the cream cheese frosting better.  It's all about personal preference.  Even if I don't make this recipe, if I need a vanilla frosting for other recipes, I will be sure to use this frosting.  Definitely try it!

I haven't made this recipe but the recipe I use isn't dry, and the frosting is no fail.  For the cake, substitue 1 cup of oil for the shortining and increase the sugar to 2 cups.  The frosting is 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 1lb powdered sugar, and 1tsp vanilla.  Let frosting ingrediants warm to room temp before mixing to avoid overheating mixer or make in food processor.

I grew up on red velvet cake & this recipie is the REAL MCCOY!  I am glad to have found the authentic recipie.  It is fabulous.  To the people who says the icing turns out runny, I am sure that you are not letting the flour & milk paste cool enough.  It must be absolutely COLD of the butter will melt & run & the icing won't turn out creamy like it should.  Put that pan in the refrigerater & let it cool for a good hour before you mix it with the butter & sugar!  Good luck!

Traditional red velvet cake?  This is it.  I've made this recipe several times, and I tried to skip some steps in my first attempts.  Don't skip steps.  The swirls of cocoa will happen, among other things.  I did add an extra heaping TBSP of cocoa powder, however, and only used one ounce of red food coloring.  Because you really need two ounces to make the paste (that extra liquid is necessary), as the recipe calls for, I added a bit of extra vanilla to the paste so I could mix the cocoa properly.  For those who say the cake is too dense - that is what it's supposed to be.  It allows for baking a flat cake because you can really spread that cake batter evenly into the pan, which allows for slicing in half for making the traditional 4 layers.  For those who say the icing is too goopey, they probably did not cook the flour/milk to a paste, or perhaps they didn't let it cool properly.  Either would cause that problem.  When making 4 layers, as I did, it's necessary to double the recipe for the icing.  Substituting a cream cheese icing is fine for those who think that's what they prefer - but this is the authentic recipe.  It's quite good.  Thanks for sharing!!  Oh, it really is best the next day.  Try to make a day ahead.  The moisture of the icing will help the cake, which can be dry at first.  But upon sitting over night as an iced cake, this is really top-notch.

I just made this cake for a family friend's party, and as an experienced baker I personally don't recommend using this specific recipe if you're a beginner. For someone who knows very little about baking cakes or never uses anything but a box mix and felt like trying something new, it's very easy to follow the directions to the letter and end up with a mess. 
I made the following alterations and had excellent results: Added 2 extra tablespoons of cocoa powder, because I like plenty of chocolate. Only used 1 bottle of food dye. Replaced the shortening with vegetable oil for convenience. Used less baking soda and added about 1.5 teaspoons baking powder, as well as removed the vinegar as it wasn't necessary. Also, MIX THE VANILLA IN WITH THE OIL AND SUGAR, NOT THE BUTTERMILK. And finally, the frosting will work fine the way it is as long as the butter and sugar are creamed thoroughly and you beat everything together with an electric mixer (makes it fluffy). 
I decorated the cake with more cocoa powder and chocolate shaving, but I honestly don't know what the 'traditional' topping is as this is my first time making red velvet cake. Either way, the cake turned out lovely and I'll make it again if requested :)

This recipes is wonderful but like some people have said it is a drier cake. I tried some of the changes a couple of reviewers did and the result was a much moister cake. I used 2 cups sugar instead of one and a half. and I used one and quarter cups buttermilk instead of only one cup. I used 1 cup oil instead of shortening. I also put 4 tbsp of cocoa instead of 2. i also used 2 1/2 ounces of red food coloring instead of 2. The color was gorgeous very rich and dark. I made luscious butter cream frosting, a recipe you can find on this site this time I made chocolate butter cream on the cake all I can say is yummmmmm!! this is definitely a keeper!!

For those of you confused about the "traditional" icing on a red velvet cake, the fact is that there just isn't one.  Nobody is sure where the recipe originated, other than 'the south', and the most popular topping is a cream cheese frosting.  Professional shops that serve red velvet cake use either butter cream, cream cheese, or butter roux.  As a matter of fact, the I have been able to find out about the original (or closest to it) recipes is that the red color is supposed to come from beets, rather than food coloring.  This cake, however, is delicious with the coloring it uses.  I would suggest following the recipe exactly.

The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the cake was pretty dry. It tasted great and the frosting was great. If it were a little more moist it would be perfect. I plan to make it again with more liquid.

Amazing reciepe! I used the one custom version of using 1 cup of oil and 2 cups sugar instead of 1/2 cup shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar. 
I've had to make this cake twice in a week, that's how much both sides of my family loved it!!

This recipe is actually great, but needed some alterations.  It turns out perfect every time with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups of white sugar, 1 ounce of red food coloring, and 1 cup of vegetable oil instead of shortening.  There are absolutely no cocoa swirls if you just add the red food coloring to the buttermilk mixture and put in the cocoa powder while mixing the vegetable oil, sugar, and eggs.  Due to the fact that it's a fan favorite and it's a bit hard to execute the flour frosting recipe, I use the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site and just add a little bit more powdered sugar and vanilla extract :)  If you are determined to make the flour frosting, it's easier to replace the flour with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I know you will love this red velvet cake recipe with the proper changes!

This is the same recipe my family has followed for years and is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE cake!!  To me, if you put cream cheese frosting on a red velvet cake you've just ruined it.  This frosting cannot be beat.  Note: the longer you beat the butter/sugar, the better the frosting will be.  I beat mine for about 5-7 minutes.

After reading some of the reviews, I modified this slightly.  I used 5 tablespoons of cocoa, substituted shortening with butter, increased the vinegar to 3 teaspoons and substituted the buttermilk with 3/4 cups heavy cream and 1/4 cup of water.  It was the best red velvet I've ever made and/or eaten!!!! It was super moist, and even tasted great before adding cream cheese frosting.

I have been making this exact cake for many many years. The frosting on this cake has to be beaten until it is like whipped cream. That is the secret. Otherwise it will come out looking curdled and gritty. This is a WONDERFUL cake if made exactly as the instructions state without any modifications. It never hurts to follow a recipe without changing it.

I was almost scared to make this cake, but my sister requested it for her birthday and I couldn't say no.  I made the cake twice in one day.  I don't know what happened to the first batch but I followed other reviews to use 1c oil instead of shortening and the cake sunked in the middle. Made the second batch and used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup oil instead of shortening, batter was thicker and fluffy.  Turned out moist and great consistency.

Absolutely fabulous. I made this with all the suggested modifications, plus a few blunders - I accidentally used a 1 1/2 tbsp measure in plan of 1 tbsp, so mine had something like 10 tbsp of cocoa powder. It was SO good, though. The frosting has to be cold, not just cool, and make sure to mix it very well to avoid soupyness. And don't be like me and fail to realize that the frosting will go bad after the cake sits out for a week!

I thought this frosting was wonderful.  Since others said it did not thicken well, I used 4 T of flour and 1 T cornstarch instead of 5 T of flour.  The milk and flour mixture thickened very nicely.  It seems to me that it would have thickened fine with just the flour.  Maybe others aren't cooking it long enough?  I also added just a pinch of salt (I think almost all frostings are improved with a pinch of salt).  Next time I might use a little less sugar (it is VERY sweet).  I would also put my sugar in the blender a little first (or use finer grained bakers sugar) as the sugar never melts in the recipe and it is just a tiny bit grainy.

I used this recipe for making cupcakes for my daughter's birthday at school. I baked it with the changes mentioned earlier: 3tbsp cocoa powder, 1.5 cup oil, 2 cups sugar, 1tbsp white vinegar. The cake turned out moist & excellent. With the modifications, I felt it was a little salty... that's why the 4 stars. I think only 1/2 tsp salt, & 4tbsp cocoa powder should be added. Bake it at 325F for 25 min for perfect cupcakes. It tastes better when chilled for few hours.
Regarding food color, I wanted to inform you all to use 1/2 tsp red gel paste food color or 1 1/2 oz liquid red food color or 1/2 oz red food color powder.
The frosting was yummmm... I think you need a kitchenaid mixer to get a perfect frosting. I just bought a new one & saw the difference.  I'm baking the cake again for my daughter's Hello kitty birthday party.... red theme. Shall post pics soon.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I was a little concerned with some of the other reviews in reference to the cake being dry and/or bland.  No problem with either of those issues.  My husband, who is not very enthusiastic about many cakes, raved about this one.  He had a slice right after Sunday dinner and went back for seconds, immediately.  Will definately add this to my repitoire....

This recipe is the closest I could find to the RV cake I had growing up in the 1960's.   

I tasted a store bought RV a few years ago, and it was AWFUL!! I have wanted to make one since, the last time I baked one was 25 years ago. 

Finally, I found my dad's 40 yr old recipe, which came with the famous story about the woman who paid for it and mailed it out in chain letters. 

I decided to look online just to see what was out there and I was surprised that there are so many variations. Yesterday I made dad's recipe for nostalgia sake, so I could judge based on the cake I remember as scrumptious.  

The difference in dad's cake ingredients includes only 2 cups of flour, 1 TB cocoa, 1TB vinegar. 

Many online recipes show more dry ingredients and some less food coloring (2 1/4 C + flour, up to 1/4 C cocoa), but they don't increase the liquids ratio. This may be why some cakes are dry ??? 

Variations my dad may have added to the frosting was 1 C powdered sugar, rather than cane sugar, and he sprinkled the cake with coconut flakes which really makes it, if you like coconut. It also looks great.  

I think I will need another slice to see if it tastes as good as it did 35 years ago.  My husband liked it, and he doesn't eat many goodies. It tastes so fresh,it puts packaged cakes/frostings and store bought cakes to SHAME. I forgot what real ingredients actually taste like.  

The only alteration I will consider next time is adding 1-2 T cocoa. Other than that, no changes on this ol

This is the original Waldorf-Astoria Red Velvet recipe, with the exception that it doesn't say to heap the tablespoons of cocoa.  It takes a bit of work, but the results are amazingly good.  The cakes turn out wonderful, but keep an eye on them.  If they are overcooked, they turn out dry.  In my oven at 350, two 9 inch pans take 28 minutes.  When I lived at a lower altitude, it took a few minutes less time.  The only change I make to the recipe is to substitute unsalted butter for the shortening and reduce the food coloring to one ounce.  In my opinion, butter makes for a richer, moister cake and one ounce of red food coloring makes it plenty red. 

The frosting can be challenging, especially the first time.  I have never had a problem with lumps in the flour and milk mixture.  I whisk it as it cooks.  It doesn't take long to thicken, and I stir it the entire time.  It may seem like the white sugar in the frosting recipe will not blend in.  It does.  After combining the four and milk mixture with the sugar, butter and vanilla mixture, expect to beat the frosting on high speed with an electric mixer for 8 or 9 minutes.  The frosting comes out a lot like whipped cream when it is finished.  

This is a very old recipe, and I hate to see that credit isn't given to its origins.  It is an award winner, too.  Wonderful recipe!

It's actually funny; I have the same recipe except with 1 1/2 c. oil instead of 1/2 c. shortening. I know it seems like a ton, but it makes the moistest, lightest, most delicious cake out there! Also, it has 2 tsp. vinegar and a bit less food coloring. For cupcakes, bake only 15 minutes and they rise beautifully. Trust me, if you want to make red velvet cake make these changes!

This is the exact recipe I have been making for years.  Perfect the way it is...no modifications needed.  It just may take a little practice.  And, I agree, this IS the correct icing for RV cake.  A little time consuming, but well worth it.  Delicious!

After following other reviewers advice about the oil and extra sugar, this cake turned out perfect! My family said that it was the best they had ever had. I put cream cheese frosting between the layers and frosted the outside with chocolate buttercream.  Everyone absolutely loved it. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I just made this cake. Don't know how it tastes yet. But I wanted to advise people on the frosting. DO NOT USE powdered sugar. It will make the frosting runny and unusable. So I tried again with regular sugar and it worked better, less runny. I would refrigerate it a little first before applying to the cake. :)

This is the exact recipe, frosting and all, that my grandma, mom and I have made for many many years. The frosting is temperamental. Humid days, it won't set up. If your beaters or bowls are not clean, it won't set up. I've only been successful with it a few times but it was well worth it each of those times. This frosting recipe makes the cake for sure!

I cant believe I almost did not make this cake after reading all the negative reviews.  I did follow other reviewrs advice and used 1 cp oil rather than shortening, added 4+ tbsp of cocoa pwdr, and increased sugar to 2 cps.  I did not have any vinegar so I used 1 tsp of lemon juice instead.  This cake came out light and airy not dense or dry at all.  Cake by itself is not very tasty, but after frosting the cake with butter cream frosting ... it is to die for.  It tastes just like Entenmann's chocolate cake I used to enjoy as a child.    The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I modified the recipe as per other reviewers suggestions.   Hands down the best cake I have baked thus far.  I will be making this cake again and again
Just a note, my cake did not come out red.  I was stingy with the red food coloring and maybe since I subsituted lemon juice for vinegar.  It was probably a combination of the two, but the cake was incredibly scrumptious.

Just a note to those having problems with the icing: the thickened white sauce needs to be near icy before you begin, and the CAKE also needs to be very cold. I put mine in the freezer -- always -- for several minutes before attempting to frost the cake. If you follow this one often neglected hint, you should have no problem. And as far as the red swirls, I always have mixed the food coloring with the buttermilk, added to the eggs and butter creamed together first before adding the other dry ingredients -- including the sugar (only exception to the old rule is this recipe). And, no swirls. Just a beautiful red cake. good luck!

Wow fantastic cake!! The icing is the "piece de resistance! " I was not sure if I was going to try it, and was about to make cream cheese icing, but realized I was out of icing sugar, and remembered reading that this icing was worth trying and trying until succeeding (that is is worth the work) . Well it worked on my first try, and it was amazing!! My son said he wished it was the only kind of icing in the entire world!  lol he key for me was to really whip it a klot. more then I would have thought. But once you combine your milk and flour mixture with the sugar and butter mixture, really give it some extra mixing time. :) The icing is SOOO worth it!(I also added a bit more sugar to the cake and used one cup oil instead of the shortening! )

I thought it was a bit on the dry side. I used oil instead of shortening, 2 cups of sugar, no vinegar, and only 1 oz of red food coloring (and it was still very very red).

This cake was a bit dry, not very moist as a red velvet cake should be.  The flavor was bland. Also, the original icing was very goopy and thin.  I was kind of disappointed with this cake.

Delicious! This recipe turned out to be very good w/the changes that others have suggested.  I used oil not shortening and I only had a 1 oz. btl. of red food coloring and it still turned out a deep red.  BTW, the baking soda and vinegar are important, they make the cake rise.  Also, I didn't use the frosting in the recipe, but used the cream cheese & butter frosting instead.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  It's been years since I've made a cake and the frosting from scratch (I'm more of a cookie and confectionery person), but I decided to give this one a try.  I followed other's suggestions and I used 1 cup oil, 4 tbsp Cocoa, and 1 cup sugar. The cake turned out beautiful!  Very moist, very tasty, not too sweet, not too chocolatey, really had a flavour of it's own. No problems at all with it rising. The frosting took some time to get thick on the stovetop, I ended up turning up the heat a bit (just under medium) and then stirring continuously, and that made it perfect.  Had a nice frothy buttercream texture and was easy to work with. This cake was a hit with everyone who tried it, and I plan to make it again for sure. I give it 5 stars with the alterations to the recipe. I should also mention that I mixed some raspberry pie filling in with the icing in the center of the cake, and it was just fabulous.  A suggestion for any raspberry and chocolate lovers out there.

I followed the recipe except I made cupcakes. They turned out perfectly and I received many compliments on the frosting. Make sure the flour roux is cooled completely and the butter is soft before trying to blend. some users said their frosting was lumpy - I used the mixer and blended the frosting until it was light and fluffy.

I tried this recipe for the first time and it was amazing! I followed the changes suggested by other reviewers and half of it was gone the very next day! I had the "cottage cheese" problem with my frosting. I realized that I just had too much butter, so i strained the icing and whipped it up and it looked perfect.

Yummy! I made the changes suggested by others (3 T. cocoa, 2 c. sugar, 1 c. oil) and it turned out quite well. My only problem was the cakes sticking to the pans. Maybe I didn't grease the pans well enough. Oh, still turned out great. Very moist and excellent chocolate flavor. My only other complaint was how difficult it was to find 2 ounces of red food coloring. I had to go to 4 different stores before I found someplace that didn't just sell packages of all the colors.

My first time to make a Red Velvet Cake was for Christmas.  I took the suggestions of other reviews and used 4 Tbl. cocoa, 1 oz. food coloring was plenty, two cups of sugar, and used 1 c. of oil instead of shortening. It was a hit with everyone from my two year old grandson to my husband.  One of my daughters loves Red Velvet Cake so leftovers went home to her.  Six year old grandson who is not big on sweets ate all his piece (he said it was his favortite color.  I used cream cheese frosting because that was what daughter #3 wanted.

This is not the original recipe I had and all the reviewers are pointing to what the differences are. I always made this with a little more cocoa so I had to add some of the buttermilk to make the chocolate and red (yes 1 oz. is on the original recipe) paste.  That is the secret to getting it red and not brown streaked.  That might be why this recipe called for the full 2 oz. but that didn't work for one reviewer.  I also switched to corn oil because I don't keep shortning anymore but 3/4 cup is enough. To cut calories, use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of sugar substitute like Splenda.  Yes, you don't need both the vinegar and the buttermilk but I have the best results with buttermilk and add that extra Tablespoon or two to the paste when you start.  It takes longer than 15 minutes to get this together and it takes longer than that to clean up all the red food coloring which is presently on my fingers as I type.  I have used all the frostings but the original butter creme is best JUST don't burn it.

I have made this recipe for cupcakes 4 times now, both as the original and with the modifications that have been suggested and given positive reviews by others. 

Although it's not normally what I'd recommend, in this case I strongly suggest skipping the original and going straight to the modifications, given again below:

Substitute 1 cup oil for the shortening,
Use 2 cups sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups),
Add 1-2 extra tsp cocoa powder.

I thought this cake was pretty good.  I was a little disappointed with the texture of it, however.  It was pretty heavy - moist, but heavy.  Maybe that's how red velvet is supposed to be.  Anyhow, the taste was very good.  Now to the frosting.  I was TERRIFIED to make something that sounded so crazy!  Am I glad I did!  It's the best frosting I've ever made.  This will now be my go-to frosting for cakes.  I'm willing to bet that you could add cocoa powder to it and make it chocolate frosting too.  The only thing I will try next time is to warm the milk before adding the flour.  It seemed like I stood there 15 minutes stirring it - maybe warming it first will cut back on that time.

I thought this was an okay version of what I look for in a red velvet cake, but I definitely wouldn't call it great.  I didn't alter the recipe too much, except I added more cocoa and used less food coloring and the cake still came out bright red.  I found the end product a bit too dry and it had too much of a floury taste.  I used exactly as the recipe called for, no more.  I know these cakes usually have this kind of taste, but this was way too overpowering.  I had to overcompensate on the frosting to not notice the flour.  I also didn't use the frosting because I prefer a cream cheese frosting.  Overall, I say it's average, but I will definitely try it again with the suggestions from other reviewers.

This cake was aweful!  I followed the recipe exactly. It was heavy, dry (even though I baked it a good 5 minutes less than recipe stated)& had NO taste to it.  Then the icing:  the taste was ok, but it was the consistency of liquid. This recipe will prevent me from making "from scratch" any time soon--all the time & effort, ugh!

What a color!  This cake looks like a stop sign with icing!  Traditional Southern flavor and good texture too.  I never heard of making icing this way, but it turned out creamy and mild--really good with this cake.  I'll be making this one again.

I was making this cake 50 years ago...the original recipe for the frosting calls for using crisco, not butter or oil....it is a very touchy recipe but if you can get it right it is to die for...tastes just like whipped cream...at first I had problems with it curddeling, but finally mastered it..

Instead of buttermilk, I used 1 cup milk and 1 tbsp of white vinegar and let that sit for about 5 minutes. Instead of 1/2 shortening, I used 3/4 vegetable oil and also used less salt. Other than that, I followed the recipe. The tops of the cakes were a little ugly with brown swirls, but I cut the domed tops anyway, and the color inside was beautiful! I also halved the recipe to make 12 regular sized cupcakes that turned out beautifully. I baked the cupcakes at 325 for 20 minutes.

Beautiful cake and the frosting was unbelievably good.  The cake, though was somewhat dry and not quite chocolate-y enough for me.  Glad I read the reviews on the frosting - or I wouldn't have known to heat the flour/milk mixture till the consistency of mashed potatoes.  I used almond milk instead of milk in the frosting.  Next time I make it, I will increase the cocoa, maybe add more buttermilk to make it moister (?)

The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 1 or 2 is because my guests ate up the whole cake and my husband loved it. If I went according to my taste though it would not be so good. I really hated it and that's with the changes the others suggested. I will be searching for a different Red Velvet recipe

I make this recipe exactly as is except I substitute the shortening with vegetable oil (more true to authentic southern red velvet recipes) and it comes out much more moist and perfect every time.  I've found that it's best when you let it sit for a day before serving much like good carrot cake and banana bread recipes.  Family and friends ALWAYS request this cake for special occasions.

Made a few adjustments per other reviews: 1 cup oil, 2 cups sugar, 1oz red food coloring. I had some issues with the frosting, but I was able to recover by adding more flour and a touch more of sugar. With the changes, this came out tasty

This cake was dense and not that flavorful even with the suggested changes from other readers. My husband and kids refused to eat it!! The frosting was also "cottage cheese " like in appearance as I read others comment and not that great tasting either ....overall a flop :(

I loved this recipe. I added more sugar,  3 tblsp of cocoa powder and 1 oz of food coloring (worked out I only had 1oz) this was so good, came out perfect. I did not use the frosting,didn't like the flour idea, I used a cream cheese recipe. it was awsome thanks

Sorry, after reading reviews I chose not to try this cake. However, I used this frosting recipe.  The frosting was EXCELLENT!! I used white granulated sugar and did not change a thing.  I beat for approx. 10 min. for consistency and it is worth it!!  I did refrigerate for a few short min before frosting. I then frosted the bottom layer and put cake in fridge for approx. 30 min to set so that the top would not slide. Then finished frosting cake and put in fridge for about an hour to set. After cake was set it was ok to be left out of fridge.  Did take extra steps but was well worth it!  Thanks for this recipe.  For those interested I used RV cake recipe from pinchmysalt.com and it was so very moist, flavorful, colorful and awesome!

This was a disaster for me...I have been baking for years and followed the directions perfectly, and even made the substitutions recommended by the other reviews....and the cake ended up tasting like corn bread! It was dry and had no taste. And the frosting was off as well. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and I am so upset that it turned out the way it did. I am baking him another cake just to make up for it!

The best cake I never made! I made this cake 3 times so far and it was just as good the first time as the third time. Made adjustments based on previous reviews (added more cocoa & sugar, used 1 cup of vegetable oil insetad of 1/2 cup shortening). I also added slivered almonds on top of the iceing for presenatation and texture.
Amazing!

This is such a great recipe. I followed other suggestions and used 1 cup of oil, homemade buttermilk (skim milk and vinegar), 3TB of cocoa powder, and 1 oz of food coloring. I also added more sugar than the recipe called for. I added a little twist to the frosting by reducing the amount of butter called for and replacing that with cream cheese. I did not even need to cook the frosting on the stove! This is definitely a keeper!

Note to anyone that needs batter measurements:  This only yeilds about 5 1/2 cups of batter, so if you are measuring your amounts for the sake of having this cake measure a certain height for cake decorating, you may have to make a second batch.

Everything about this cake is exceptional.  I made it with the adjustments suggested by the previous reviewers.  I just love, love, love the not too sweet icing also! Thank you for submitting this recipe!  It will be an outstanding Thanksgiving dessert!

This cake was actually good in texture, but lacks the cocoa flavor.  I think maybe 6-8 T of cocoa powder might do the trick.  Otherwise, it's a good cake.

I don't know what happened, but apparently this frosting cannot be made ahead. I made the cake and the frosting the night before, popped the frosting in the fridge and could NOT get it to a spreading consistency the next day (maybe I was impatient!) so I decided to beat it a little bit and it totally separated! It was toast so I had to make more and it turned out just beautiful and tasted great. :) The cake part was easy to make and tasted great!

I've been making this cake for YEARS, and everyone just loves it. My mom makes it, too! She puts her mixer on high and mixes the final batter for a good long time to get the cake nice and fluffy.  I've also made this into cupcakes, which are delicious.  For the frosting, you really do have to get all the flour dissolved into the milk first, otherwise it won't get that nice, frosting-like texture.  At the Holidays I add green food coloring to the frosting. It contrasts most festively with the red cake for Christmas!

I absolutely love this cake recipe!  Best tasting red velvet cake I've ever had!!!  And I made it!  I didn't use the icing recipe.  I used my own buttercream recipe that I always use.  3 cups confection sugar....1 stick of butter...1 tsp pure vanilla extract and some french vanilla coffee cream to make it creamy.

The first time I tried the recipe, my cake was great ( with the given modifications provided by the other members such as,  1 cup of oil instead of the shortening and 2 cups of sugar. Also the additional teaspoon of  cocoa powder) However the icing was difficult . It was extremely grainy  (my husband said it looked like grits, but tasted great) the second time around, I did what another member mentioned, I used powdered sugar instead and it came out better. The look was still a little off, but the taste made-up for it. I will continue working on the icing...... it taste soooo good.

I made this cake yesterday for my husband's birthday and it was amazing!  I did modify the recipe as suggested by other reviewers, adding an extra 1-2 tablespoons of cocoa powder, substituting 1 cup of vegetable oil for the shortening, and adding 1/4 cup more sugar to the oil/sugar/egg/flour mixture.  The result was a light, super moist cake with great, not too sweet flavor.   And the frosting?  This is the first time I've made this type of frosting and it's also a winner!!  Everyone loved this cake!!

This is the first cake I have ever made and it turned out beautifully.  It was also my first time eating read velvet cake.  I made it according to suggestions; I used oil, I increased cocoa powder, I had no buttermilk, made sour milk (1 cup of milk+1 tbls vinegar, I did not increase the sugar because with the frosting I think it is sweet enough.  Remember to completely fold in the baking soda and vinegar combination, people will be disgusted to take a big bit out of baking soda (very bitter).  I stuck to the frosting in this recipe because my family hates cream cheese frosting.  I had no problem with it at all, I did use powdered sugar, one suggestion; pour the milk into the flour and whisk at the same time, this prevents it from clumping.  I made this for my grandma's birthday with marshmallow fondant (also my first time) on top and I have never had so many praises.  FYI, this case stores in the fridge very well, I made it the day before, frosted it and put it in the fridge overnight.  I let it get to room temp. before we served it.  I then put the leftover in the fridge and ate some later on, this cake tastes better chilled.  I am going to make another one for another birthday, can't wait!

I'm very disappointed with this cake!  I was really looking forward to it. As another person reviewed earlier, the edges of the cake turned hard & the center fell.  I made the substitutions of 1 cup oil instead of shortening, 4 TBS. cocoa & 2 cups sugar.  I have no idea what happened but I'm disappointed that it is ruined. So much for red velvet cake for our Christmas Eve get together.

Ugh!!!!  After 30 minutes, the edges were hard but the middles sank down and were raw inside.  Cake was dry, too. What a waste of time and ingredients. :-(

this is basically the same red velvet recipe my mother gave me to make for my father's birthday. only differences is she uses 3 tablespoons of cocoa, 2 1/4 cups of flour, and 1 tsp of baking soda.  the icing i use is different, however. [ 1 cup Crisco 1 c sugar 3 Tbsp flour 1 tsp vanilla 2/3 cup milk ; start out real slow then beat on high for 12 minutes with electric mixer or until smooth and creamy. ]  overall, it's a great recipe :D

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday a few days ago, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I had to make some revisions. Like many other people I upped the sugar to 2 cups and substituted 1 c. oil for the shortening (I hate using shortening unless it's ABSOLUTELY necessary.) I did use more cocoa than most - a total of 5 tbsp and only one oz. of the red food coloring. It turned out to be a gorgeous, rich red color and it tasted amazing! There was more than enough batter and I ended up putting it in 3 9 in. round pans. Very rich and moist and my boyfriend LOVED it. I will definately make this again!

use 1 cup veg oil instead of shortening, and 2 cups sugar. also it should be on TBSP not one TSP vinegar. when you make the red and cocoa paste, use 1 oz coloring and add 1 tbsp buttermilk to keep the cake from marbling. beat the frosting to death and itll be perfect.

I've made this quite few times over the years and I still love it.  It turns out wonderfully every single time.  I usually add a bit more cocoa though.

A hint on the icing, I use a whisk to mix the milk and flour before heating to prevent lumps.  Also, it does need to be refrigerated or you will have a runny mess.

I made this cake last night for today, and unfortunately it did not turn out well.  I usually read all of the reviews but I missed them saying that you really need the milk to be Ultra chilled because as soon as I started to spread the icing it began to separate.  Luckily after being in the frige all night I was able to smooth it enough to at least look presentable in the morning.  I really think a cream cheese icing would have been much better.  Also, the cake cake out on the dry side, and like another reviewer said, I could see and I think even taste the chocolate in some of the bites.  I'm giving it a three because it is okay to eat, just not very exciting.  I'm glad I happened to decide to make two different desserts.

I made this cake and it was dry and bland.  This recipe is very close to the original recipe, but needs more cocoa and more shortening or butter.  The icing was the original recipe and turned out superb.  Although, I will keep looking for the perfect cake.

I followed the other suggestions of 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of oil, and putting the food coloring (1 bottle) in the buttermilk and doubling the cocoa powder.  I used 2 8 inch heart shaped pans and baked for 30 minutes.  My cakes were perfect--moist and oh so yummy!  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting (1 pkg cream cheese, 1.5 cups powdered sugar, 2 tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla).  I split the two cakes and made a four layer.  The frosting was just enough for a thin coat between each layer and to frost.  This is a KEEPER!  YUM!

I made this cake twice.  The first time I followed the recipe verbatim and it I wasn't very happy with the results.  The cake was dry and tough, and it tasted heavily of flour, salt & vinegar.  It reminded me of the consistency of cornbread (well - not exactly but close).  Then made it again with the recommended changes: doubled the cocoa, increased sugar to 2 cups; used 1 cup of oil in place of shortening; increased vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. and increased vinegar to 1 tbsp.  What a difference -- it was very moist, almost a bit oily but very good.  I also switched to a cream cheese frosting the second time which I preferred.

This recipe was a big hit! It tasted great and everyone loved it. Do follow the advice of other reviewers and replace the shortening with oil and add more cocoa. For the icing, it is a good idea to refridgerate flour mixture before adding the other ingredients. I highly recommend this recipe!

when the frosting doesn't turn out,
and just drips off the cake) is wonderful!

This was a great recipe.  I actually followed the directions to the letter and the cake turned out very good, moist and not try at all.  i also used this cake with fondant to create an Assassin's Creed cake, using the buttercream fondant and frosting recipes on this website.  Not the standard frosting, i know, but it tasted great!  It was very easy to make, too, and i had not made a cake from scratch in 15 plus years or from a box in at least 10, so that made me pretty happy.  My husband, whose birthday it was, loved it.

First of all, red velvet cake isn't my favorite, and that's mainly why it's only 4. But it's a great recipe for a friend's bday if they like red velvet.

The red food coloring took me forever to find (two boxes of McCormick's) and cost $5. I'm going to buy this online for next time. I also didn't do a good enough job of mixing the cocoa paste in, and the coloring was uneven.

The directions were confusing, but use a brown glass bowl to mix the baking soda and vinegar so it can react before you add it in. (obvious now).

Finally, the frosting took 2 tries, but turned out perfect. The key was to use a hand mixer to cream for you otherwise it may not get creamy enough. Then add the gravy like milk in four equal portions, mixing thoroughly between potions.

The picture shows strawberries with it. Must try next time.

Used the most helpful tips, and WOW, wonderful cake!  I've heard many people have trouble with the moistness, I removed my cake from oven 3 min. early (27 min) and it was perfect!  I also substituted 1/2 C olive oil and 1/2 C vegetable oil.  Was GREAT. I would add 4 T cocoa if you want a more chocolatey flavor, 3 wasn't quite enough.  So, good, thanks for this recipe!

This is the red velvet cake I grew up with - perfect in every way.  Do note though - the frosting is very picky.  It does not like heat or humidity.  The milk/flour mix must be totally cool before adding to the butter/sugar mixture.  Then beat them together like crazy - and I mean CRAZY - I usually beat 8-10 minutes using my Kitchenaid.  Be sure to keep the cake in the fridge until serving.  YUMMO!

Amazing. I inherited this recipe from my husband's family, and like many others, found it really dry and a bit bland. I was happy to find others with the same opinion and simple solutions. I re-made the cake a week later with this recipe and all loved it. I think we're just not accustomed to the flavor of Crisco (which my original recipe called for instead of the vegetable oil; I used canola oil) in a cake. I liked it with more cocoa (2-3 tbsp) and less red color. Great tweaks to a lovely recipe! Still very puttery but worth it in the end.

I am making this for a shower that I am going to this weekend, and it has turned out quite well.  I followed the advice to use 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of oil, which worked well.  I also used gel food colouring, which requires much less than the recipe calls for.  I mixed it with the cocoa (added 1 extra Tbsp) and a bit of the buttermilk.  The paste looked well mixed, but I too have some swirls in my cake.  I haven't been able to taste it as I am wheat free, but it sure smells delicious!

I don't know much about red velevet cake and was never overly fond of it but my kids love it so I decided to make one for Valentines Day.  There are so many versions!! So I did some research and found that red velvet cake can range from vanilla to chocolate to almond there is no 'right' way only personal preference.  As I thought it was a southern dish I decided to check Paula Deens recipe - which is about the same but has only 1 tsp of cocoa and 1 1/2 c oil.  Best tip on here is do not substitute ingredients, they are designed to work together.  Concerned about complaints of dryness, I followed Paula's 1 1/2 c of oil - which is preferable for this cake over butter according to my research.  I used 2 tsp of cocoa powder cuz I don't love chocolate cake.  The resulting cake was fabulous - the kids LOVED it!  Next time I will try the 1 C of oil and 2 TBs of cocoa....but the frosting is what gets the 5 stars - very delicious.

Cake:

Made these as cupcakes for my daughter's birthday today. Followed recipe to the T except adding another tblsp cocoa powder and 1 1/2oz of coloring as that was the whole bottle. Was shocked when I had to use the whole bottle of the red coloring.....didn't realize 2oz is quite a lot. The cake was soft and moist even though I didn't use oil as other reviewers recommended. My kids loved them.

Topping:

Instead of cooling the flour mixture I just put it in the mixer until it cools down to room temperature and add the rest of the ingredients. It definitely taste like whipping cream. My only problem was it was overwhelmingly sweet. So to save the cream and cut down the sweetness, I used a package of cream cheese and 1/2c shortening. Beat the cheese and shortening in the mixer  till lumps are gone and quite fluffy and add about 3/4 of the original topping and beat again till fluffy.

Was amazing, with the suggested alterations from other users.  The icing was also lovely, not overpoweringly sweet. Will make this cake again!

It is VERY light and fluffy, it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have any food coloring and I used butter instead of shortening.  I am a beginner baker and still managed to make it turn out great.  The frosting turned out strange, but I'm positive I did something wrong.  The frosting was still delicious even though it looked weird.  Wonderful recipe, I recommend it to everybody!

I made this cake with the modifications suggested (oil, more sugar, more cocoa).  I found it to be very dry and somewhat bland.   Confession 1 - although I'm from the south where Red Velvet Cake rules - I had never actually eaten it before.  I made it for my brother because he says it is his favorite.   I thought the flavor was OK but not great.  He said it was good "but".  It seemed a little off but I'm really not sure what it SHOULD taste like.    Confession 2 - He is diabetic so I substituted Splenda for sugar.  I increased the Splenda to 2 cups as suggested for the sugar.  I think I'll try it again at 1 1/2 cups to see if that makes a difference.  Sometimes Splenda, in large doses, can leave a chemical flavor/aftertaste.  I know it shouldn't in baking but I'll try anyway.  The cake was also very flat and dense.  I'm an experienced baker so I'm wondering if it had to do with the Splenda. This was my first try at a Splenda cake so I'm not sure.  The icing was really good and it worked great using Splenda.

I cannot tell you how happy I am to see the original frosting used with this cake - I cannot stand the creamcheese, as it is too sweet and takes away from the delicate flavor of the cake itself. It compliments it as it should - hence the saying  "that's just the frosting on the cake . . ."

Excellent cake. Tasted great and texture was good.  I didn't use the recomended 2 ounces of food coloring I used only 1 ounce and it still came out a nice red color. I also didn't use the frosting in  the receipe, I used my own.

Very very dry and not much taste. I made the cake with the original recipe.  Maybe I should have tried it with oil, but didn't and won't. I will just continue to get these types of cake from a bakery.

I was doing a bake sale and needed a Red Velvet Cake recipe.  After reading all the reviews, I was a bit nervous but went ahead and made the cake.  It was a hit~! But I did do the changes the other reviewers recommended:  4 tablespoons of unsweetened coco 1 cup of oil instead of shortening 2 cups of sugar  And for the frosting I used the Cream cheese frosting II recipe.  I was scared to use the flour one and everyone seemed to be use to the cream cheese frosting. I had no problems with the recipe and very happy with it.  Just know that it is a VERY heavy cake so using a mixer is key to make it moist.  The batter is really thick and would be really hard to mix by hand.

This was very easy to make. I followed the advice of a previous review and substituted 1 cup of oil for the shortening, used 2 cups of sugar, and 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I only used 1 oz of red coloring and my cake was nice and red. I thought 2 was excessive. The cake was moist and a hit with my dinner party. I paired it with a cream cheese frosting so I can't comment on the frosting provided with the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I wouldn't make this recipe again.  First of all you don't need two ounces of food colouring, that's a waste. I did not care for the icing, it was too liquidy.

I made this for my husband's birthday last night using the suggestions of other reviewers and it turned out fantastic.  I used a different frosting recipe though that I got off of a taste of home cake recipe.  I mixed two 8 ounce packages of cream cheese with 1/4 cup of butter and then added 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  Then I stirred in some coconut and spread it on the cake.  I also covered the cake with more coconut.  The frosting was really rich and complimented the cake nicely.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  I thought it came out moist and wonderful.  The icicng was also wonderful.  I did not have trouble with it but when it says "cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy"  I actually did that.  I creamed it until it was light and fluffy and then followed the rest of the directions. I did not need to beat it for 15 minutes as someone suggested.  It was a wonderful, light, whipped icing that beautifully complimented the cake.  Canned or even homemade cream cheese icing would have been too much for this rich moist cake. I took it to my sister-in-law's house for thanksgiving and everyone raved!

Unfortunately, I didn't read some of the suggestions posters made and I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was gorgeous and everyone oohed and aahed, but it was incredibly dry and the second everyone took a bite, they reached for their drinks. I was so embarrassed! I will definitely try it with oil, the extra sugar and cocoa as has been suggested. Red velvet cake is one of my favorites, and I won't give up until I get a good recipe!

loved by all that came within smelling distance but I had to take the advice of more experienced Allrecipes cooks and make these modifications (hence the 4 star rating)
  -4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder instead of only 2 
  -1 cup of oil instead of the shortening
  -OMITTED THE VINEGAR ALL TOGETHER
  -used and entire tube of red food gel. Made for a beautiful deep garnet color! 

  -I made cupcakes so I only baked for 22 min @ 350. Absolute perfection with these modifications, and passed the firefighter taste test, so you know they have to be awesome:)

I have been making this cake for almost five years now (since the first piece of Red Velvet cake I tried from Marita's Sweet Potato Pie Co in San Leandro CA).  Each time I modify the recipe slightly. So my rating is based on several cakes and taste tests.

I do not use shortening but instead oil and increase amount slightly for added moisture.  I do the same with the buttermilk (probably 1 1/4 c) and I free hand the red food coloring until I have the rich red color that I want.  I have tried the traditional butter cream frosting however, we have found that it is not as rich nor tasty as the cream cheese frosting we were introduced to.  My boyfriend is not a fan of the traditional frosting (I tried it out once) and asked that I never use it again!  I use a combination of cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and milk.  It makes for a nice consistency that my entire family loves!

Made this cake using the suggestions by other reviewer to use 1c oil, 2c sugar and 4T cocoa. Used a 9X13 pan and baked it for 50 min.  Was perfect, light and moist, with great flavor. The frosting is the perfect finish. Took it to a  New Orleans night at chuch and it disappeared. I got great reviews!!

The cake was AMAZING!  My first time baking a cake, and this one turned out wonderfully.  I used other reviewers' suggestions to increase the sugar to 2 cups, make the cocoa's measurement's heaping and substitute shortening for 1 cup oil.  However, I completely messed up the icing by using granulated sugar rather than confectioner's, taking the "white" as to mean normal.  I also did not know how thick the milk-flour mixture was meant to be thickened, so when I got frustrated I stopped.  I ended up using the canned cream cheese frosting that we had on-hand.  All-in-all, the cake was devoured by my class-mates!

I made this cake for a silent auction at our grade school. I was told by the winner that it was the best red velvet she ever had!I was happy because it was my first red velvet and my first butter roux icing. I did make a few changes after reading other reviews to play it safe. I did make the flour mixture very cold before adding to the butter/sugar. I also beat it forever and it just got creamier. I will use a finer sugar next time to prevent graininess in the frosting.

I made this with the other reviewers suggestions (3 tbsp cocoa and no vinegar) and was very pleased with how it turned out.  I had some trouble with the icing though - it tastes delicious but seems runny (despite my thickening the milk-flour mixture and beating it for a long time) and is a yellow color.  I did use Mexican vanilla, and wonder if that made a difference.  Any suggestions?

Interesting cake: I used 2c sugar and 1c oil as suggested. For buttermilk used 1c. milk and 1T w.vinegar. The cake took a little longer than alloted time. I thought the butter cream icing went very well with it. Actually, I made this for a Christmas get together and had to throw it together last minute. Everyone loved it and the taste was fantastic! Thanks

This was very good!! I have tried so many different recipes for this cake, trying to find just the right one. Often it tends to come out dry. I'm starting to believe it is in the exact amount of flour and chocolate used. I didn't have 2 round pans, had left one at my dads, so used a 9 by 13 and it came out fine. This is a keeper. I did increase sugar to 2c and vinegar to 1 tab.as recommended by others. I agree, better without the cream cheese type frosting.

This recipe is almost exactly like my recipe that I got from my mom, and have been baking for years for everyone's birthday, christmas and any other time that calls for a special cake.  Over baking will make a dry cake.  Also my recipe calls for 1 ounce of red food coloring, gets plenty red.  My icing is the cooked white icing made with shortening instead of butter.  My family and friends will not eat this cake with cream cheese icing.  I have friends who rarely eat cake but will not pass this cake up.

This recipe is very close to one I have used for 35 years. The only difference in them is I add 3tsp.cherry flavoring and 1/2tsp.almond flavoring and use a white cooked icing.  It is always a hit and these two extra flavorings just give it an extra punch.

This is the real thing!  I make this every Christmas, from a recipe my grandmother gave me many years ago.  I was looking for a recipe that was EXACTLY like my grandmother's.  Now I have one at my finger tips.  

But, I can't imagine Red Velvet Cake without cream cheese frosting.  Maybe one day I will try it that way.  Until then, I use Cream Cheese Frosting II.

Note:  This is an old-style cake.  It wasn't meant to be all that sweet (the vinegar in the ingredients may warn you), and is very sensitive to over baking (can you say dry).  When you get it right it is fabulous.

I was really happy I found this recipe and even more happy when the cake went over extremely well with my future in-laws. My fiance` loved it! I followed the modification directions of other reviewers: 4 tablespoons cocoa, 1 ounce food coloring, 1.5 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 cup oil, 2 cups sugar, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. 
I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site to frost the cake. It was delicious!!!

Ever since having this cake at Magnolia Bakery in NY, I have wanted to try to make it.  This was the first recipe I tried, and I thought it was excellent, ESPECIALLY the icing.  The cake can have a bit of a metallic aftertaste, but that may have been a baking soda issue - I will certainly make this again.

The first time I made this, I did double the chocolate as others had suggested.  The red dye that I used was a gel and unfortunately this did not blend well and there were swirls in the cake. Aside from the dryness it tasted delicious. The second time I made it for Christmas Eve, I used a liquid red dye (2 oz)- no swirls and replaced the shortening with the 1 cup of oil that other reviewers had suggested. Beautiful. It was moist and delicious. The icing was a knockout both times. This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my third time commenting on this cake. Skip the shortening and add a stick of butter. Also two bottles of red food coloring is too much. You only need a couple tablespoons, 3 at most. Anyway, when I watched the video the cake batter did not look nice and fluffy and creamy like mine. Also, the icing is exactly what I use only I cook the milk and flour mixture until it's thicker that what the video showed. The icing in the video also didn't have that nice creamy texture that mine has. It looked grainy and unappealing. I beat the heck out of mine with a Kitchen-aid mixer. Beat it for maybe 10 minutes. It will be fluffy and creamy and tasty.

I have never submitted a review for any recipe and I have been using Allrecipes for years. But this recipe called for a shout out. I made this cake for my son's birthday. I changed it into a 9X13 size, added 4 Tbspns of cocoa (dutch processed), and added 1/2 tspn. of baking powder in addition to the baking soda that is called for. I only did this because I didn't have natural cocoa powder. The color I added didn't show up and it remained a dark brown cake but that didn't really matter in the end. I also didn't increase the sugar as other reviewers have suggested. The cake was plenty sweet. The icing was incredibly easy and fantastic. I will always make this icing on cakes. 
The cake was out of this world. Every single person commented on how good it was. It was moist and flavorful. I had a professional baker as a guest and even she asked me for the recipe. All credit goes to JJohn! Thanks for making my son's 1st birthday a success.

This was ok - just average for me. I followed directions exactly, except subbing butter for shortening which I always do. I only used 1 oz color, because it was all that I had. My kids liked the cake; I found it ok. Not too sweet, which is a good thing, but it lacked something, I'm not sure what. The frosting tasted too buttery for me, but that could be just me; I'm not a buttercream frosting person so maybe that's why I don't like this frosting. It was fairly runny, I ended up not using the complete milk mixture, only about half or slightly over. However, once the cake was in the refrigerator, it did firm up. I might try this again, I'm not sure, but I will for sure adjust cocoa or sugar, and prb a different frosting.

See photo; only had half the amount of red coloring. The salt and baking soda together made this cake too salty. I´ll try it again with only 1/2 tsp salt. Tasted like a mild chocolate cake. Personally, I prefer the One Bowl Chocolate Cake over this one.

Really good! Fluffy and light texture, which I really liked. (Last RV cake I made was really dense, which I didn't care for.) I did take the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 1 cup oil and 2 cups of sugar. It was just the right amount of sweetness and was moist. Also, I used 1/3 cup of cocoa, which gave a nice hint of chocolateyness, not overwhelming. I tried to do the 1 cup milk/1 Tbsp. vinegar trick, but 1 Tbsp. didn't seem to be enough, so had to use at least 2. Not sure why. Like some others, I ended up with brown streaks, perhaps because I should have used my mixer to mix the baking soda mixture into the batter, rather than just folding it in according to the directions. Baked mini-cupcakes at 325 degrees for 15 minutes. The icing is good! A little stiffer than "Poor Man's Frosting" on this site. I think I'll stick with PMF, since the measurements for the icing for this recipe made it hard for me to frost the cupcakes. But I made my co-workers very happy! Everyone says they're delicious. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.

I followed the suggested changes by TLBRAN,--the cake tastes wonderful! I'm cursed with homemade cakes, I just can't get them to taste right. But this one was amazing! Great flavor.  The frosting definitely needs to be cold to work right, and use powdered sugar instead of regular, mine turned out grainy.

Just finished baking the cake portion of the recipe and plan on using a different recipe for a bourbon cream cheese frosting.  Before making the cake I read all the reviews and increased to 4 Tbs cocoa, 2 cups of sugar, and 1.5 t vanilla (you can never have too much vanilla) reduced to 1 oz food coloring, I also substituted the 1/2 c shortening with 1 cup of vegetable oil.  Other than that I made it according to the directions.  To test if the cake was done I used a toothpick and found it took 50 minutes for the center to be done.  By that time the edges were dry as can be and the cake actually was terrible.  I'm still giving it 4 stars because I didn't exactly follow the original recipe and you can bet next time I will.  I can't see how the original can be any worse than the cake that I baked.

My rating is for the frosting. Absolutely delicious!  Smooth, creamy, fluffy and great taste.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't make this cake tho.  Frosting was easy but time consuming because of the beating time.  Well worth it!

I just made this cake last night as others suggested where I substituted shortening with a cup of vege oil, but I kept the sugar at 1 1/2 cup as I don't like my cake too sweet, used 4 tbsp of cocoa powder, and use 1 ounce of coloring instead where I mixed it with buttermilk and it still turned out red. I didn't have white vinegar and used cider vinegar instead, but it works fine.

Make sure you put the cake straight in the oven after you mixed the batter with baking soda and vinegar to make sure your cake rise perfectly! I used whipped cream cheese topping in this site, to keep the cake on the lighter side, and put it in a fridge overnight, and it tasted AMAZING the next day!!!

4 star as I made all the substitutions.

My first red velvet cake. 
I combined all of the ingredients precisely as suggested. 

The batter looked extremely dry-- and then I tasted the batter--it tasted like nothing and I have very sensitive taste buds. There was absolutely zero flavor. Pretty red color--but we want our cake to taste as good if not better than it looks.

I just kept adding ingredients until the batter tasted yummy.  

I know I shouldn't taste batter with raw eggs--but I couldnt help myself:)
I used a total of a little over a 1/2 cup of cocoa--I added another egg, some more buttermilk and a little more sugar to balance the added cocoa... i had no shortening so I used equal aount of veg oil--and also added a couple tablespoons butter(next time i'll use butter in pace of the oil/shortening-- the batter looked really moist and was a good texture... ready for the oven! 

I was afraid I might have messed up the chemistry, but it rose beautifully and had a really nicely textured, velvety red crumb.

I let my husband taste the batter before I put it in the oven--he said it was yummy! 

Finished product: Everyone loved and raved about the cake. I used a cream cheese frosting--hubby's choice--yum!!

Thank you to the person who submitted this recipe--it gave me a base to which I could customize to our tastes...
we are foodies 'round here!:)

I made this cake on Christmas eve, and it didn't turn out as expected. It didn't rise, so I made red velvet brownies out of it instead. It was very rich to me, but my guests ate it all. I only gave it three stars because of all the adjustments you had to make. The fact that it didn't rise was purely my own fault, because I mixed it to long because it was so thick.

As per other reviews, I increased the cocoa powder to 4 T and only used 1 oz of food coloring.  Cake turned out nice and moist but I will add more cocoa next time because I think it was missing the chocolaty flavor. The icing was wonderful. I beat the butter/sugar  for 15 mins before adding the flour/milk.  Very nice.

Followed recipe with rec changes and cake was ok, a bit stodgy for my liking and not as tasty as my usual choc cake recipe. Frosting is good though, super smooth, tastes kinds like custard. The first time i made it i iced some sticky toffee cupcakes, its goot coz its not as sweet as butter cream but it doesnt pipe smooth in the same way as proper buttercream. The second time i made it (when i made the red velvet cake) i added 150g melted white choc...amazing!

Made all of the suggested changes but without thinking I used non-fat milk in the icing.  Not a good thing, it never thickened and it resulted in a runny mess. Sooo, I made the icing a second time using what I had on hand, a can of evaporated milk.  What a difference.  This icing is absolutely amazing!

This was my first time EVER making a cake, and it turned out very well! Very easy, too!

However, it was a bit dry. But the icing is AMAZING!!! I would def recommend trying one of the modified versions, to have a more moist cake.

It was for my boyfriend's birthday (and he is VERY into his taste buds and critiquing everything his tongue touches) so it was a very good sign that he enjoyed it!

Good but it wasn't as moist as I had hoped and it was a bit flat tasting. I was hoping for a bit more bite. My search for the perfect red velvet recipe continues.

This is the best red velvet recipe iv found. I make it all the time and everyone iv made it for loves it. Don't use the frosting recipe given its terrible I don't even understand why someone would make frosting this way! Very moist, works well as cupcakes and as a cake even better when its eaten cold. Be careful not to over bake, very good recipe all around.

Pretty good. I added 2 EXTRA tablespoons of cocoa for extra flavor. I also added a little extra food coloring to make sure the cocoa didn't turn it too brown. Very dense cake, like red velvet should be, but a little denser than I like it. I also added 1 extra tsp. vanilla. Made 22 cupcakes baked for 18 minutes. I might make it again. Slightly dry and a little too dense, but that may have been my fault.

This cake turned out very light and fluffy, and made beautifully domed cupcakes. I added gold rum and reduced the sugar by about half a cup so that the addition of frosting didn't make them too sweet. I think it would also be nice with whipped cream frosting. Great recipe!

This was the first time I made red velvet from scratch and it was delicious. I didn't have as much food coloring as required probably a little less that half and I was worried but it turned out wonderful. and not a problem at all. You do not need 2 ounces. The taste of chocolate is a little too subtle, so I will add some more next time. The frosting is delicious. I accidentally added 2 cups of sugar, but it still tasted really good. and easy to make

This recipe is a lot of effort for zero reward. This isn't a good cake at all. I followed the directions exactly, except due to the reviews that the cake was bland, I added a little more vanilla extract, and a splash of Franjelica, a sweet hazelnut liquer, and the cake is dry, and very flavorless.  I'll stick to my easy recipe.

I have made this cake twice already and it comes out great. The only change I make is I substitute oil for shortening. The icing is great also. I was weary of putting flour in icing instead of using confectionary sugar but it came out so smooth and not gritty.

Well the cake was quite dry, I will be trying this cake again and definitely taking the advice of others and trying it with vegetable oil instead that would make it super moist I bet!  I also used green food coloring instead (in honor of St Pattys day) that may have changed something?  The frosting was REALLY good I have never tried a frosting like that, I'm quite partial to buttercreams with powdered sugar.  Looking forward to an occasion to test this one out again :)

I followed a suggestion to add extra cocoa.  The cake was too chocolately, so much so the cake never turned red.  It got eaten, as well, it's cake, but I would stick to the original recipe with this one.

I only made the icing.  It didn't turn out very well.  It was runny and didn't look appetizing.  I think my mistake was not letting the flour and milk cool enough.  I will try it again.  I kinda like the flavor.

Very puzzled as to why this cake did not turn out well, but it was a bust. The cake was very dense and lacked flavor, and the frosting was way too buttery.

I was, not at all impressed with this recipe... luckily I made cupcakes so I only ruined the first batch. They were lacking in flavor, and fit the title "red velvet bread" more likely. To the remaining batter I added, a ton more sugar and cocoa, and a bit more vanilla. I used my own recipe for frosting... Confectioner sugar, butter, a splash of milk and half a bar of cream cheese. 
After the modifications, I was still left unsatisfied the cupcakes had a thick spongy texture... and never quite met my expectations... next time Ill try another recipe I believe.

Icing! You just need to beat for at least 10 min. I used my kitchenaid. Work past the cottage cheese stage and it really comes out beautifully. Follow all icing instructions and beat for 10 min and there will be no sugar granules left.

I made the recipe with the modifications. 2 C sugar, 1 C canola oil, 4 Tbsp cocoa and 1 Tbsp vinegar. The cake was great. We will definitely make this again!

This recipe as is, was a disappointment to me, I made it for a work picnic that my sister was attending and i thought it was too dry, however her co-workers loved it. So i decided to try it again, only this time i made a few changes and it is so moist and flavourful..............
I increased the cocoa to three (3) heaping tablespoons, 
used one and a quarter (1 1/4) cups of buttermilk, used one quarter (1/4) cup of butter and one quarter (1/4) shortening, 
decreased the sugar to one (1) cup, 
reduced the flour to two (2) cups, (using one (1) cup all-purpose flour and one (1) cup cake flour
Additions:- one (1) tsp instant coffee and one quarter (1/4) tsp cayenne pepper (I know it seems weird but it really works) which i added to the cocoa paste. Follow original directions usong these changes and u will have the moistest, most delicious cake that will have your friends begging you for more, I know I do. I frost the cake with cream cheese icing, sometimes adding crushed pecans or walnuts (or whatever nuts you prefer) between the layers and top and sides of cake. Although not the best cake, it was a great base recipe, which with a few tweaks was excellent.

My friend and I spontaneously decided to bake a cake for another friend's surprise birthday party. The taste surprised her and everyone else. This cake is amazing. I didn't have time to read other reviews and see if any changes were necessary. But the recipe by itself is pretty awesome.

Not sure what I did wrong - I followed the recipe to a "T" - I made the food color paste and the color of the cake was not red at all but a chocolaty / maroon color - more reddish in the middle, dark on the edges.  Also, it didn't rise all that much - unlike most cakes that have a bit of a rounded top, this one was flat, which I didn't like at all.  The taste was bland too - I was not sure what I tasted - a bit chocolaty but just a hint.  Certainly no other taste came through, other than what a typical white cake taste has.  The crumb was dense and a bit tough (and no, I didn't over mix or beat the batter).  The edges were quite hard / crispy too.    Boo - I won't use this recipe again and I'll continue on my pursuit!

I don't know why people think putting roux on a cake disguised as icing is delicious. i made this cake from these reviews and it came out as it was supposed to. i am an excellent baker and was craving a good red velvet cake--what a mistake this was

We were really disappointed with this recipe :(  I made the recommended changes - 1 cup oil, 2 cups sugar, 4 tablespoons cocoa - but the cake still came out incredibly dry and tasting like nothing but sugar. The cake was so dry that the edges were crispy! And I definitely didn't over-bake it because I took it out of the oven when the middle was just barely set (as I always do with cakes). Now I've never tasted a red velvet cake before, so I'm not sure what it is really supposed to be like, but what came out of my oven was inedible, so that can't be right!

Gosh...I just wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I am an experienced baker but I just didn't care for this.  I made the suggested modifications - 1 cup of oil for shortening, an extra tablespoon of cocoa, and 2 cups of sugar.  The cake was certainly beautiful, but I was disappointed to find out that it was tasteless - all I could taste was the icing.  It also had an oily flavor to it.  Not my favorite...can't say I'll be making it again.  It was gorgeous though!

Just got done making the cake and it turned out perfectly.This was the first red velvet cake i have ever made and it came out great.Very moist,not dry at all,the cake has a perfect consistence.I did make some changes and used the one cup of oil instead of shortening,2 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2, i used 2 teaspoons vanilla essence and 1 teaspoon vanilla powder,But NO Cocoa powder.I used almond essence to give some more taste to it.i am not missing the chocolate at all.Other than that i did not make the frosting myself,i used Betty Crocker cream cheese icing. I am German and our ways of baking and traditional cakes differ a lot from the American baking culture,i really have to find my way into it,but this was a good start:)Thanks!

I'm so proud of my self right now :) Did some of the things mentioned in the reviews added half a cup of sugar and almost doubled the cocoa powder. Also added some nutmeg oil in addition to the shortening.   Was pretty amazed how nice it came out, personally I had never tasted Red Velvet Cake before ... but had some guests over that are from the south and they loved it!

I followed the recipe with the changes made by other reviewers (oil in place of shortening, increased sugar, incrased cocoa) and the cake was terrible.  It was tasteless (even with an extra 2 Tbsp of cocoa), dry and the colour was concentrated to the center of the cake with brown top, bottom and sides.  I would never make this again!  I only have it 2 stars because it wasn't very difficult of a recipe to follow.

Exceptional cake! This was my first attempt at Red Velvet Cake and it turned out amazing. I used 4T cocoa, 1oz red food coloring, 1C veg oil, 2C sugar, and no vinegar.  I left the frosting recipe as it is and the frosting is amazing! I am going to use it for all of my other cakes! This recipe makes exactly 2 dozen cupcakes with lots of extra frosting, next time i will cut it in half.

I made this cake last night for the family. They loved it, I did the changes other reviewers recommended. 4 Tbsp Cocoa, vegetable oil instead of shortening, less food coloring (add to buttercream) etc. I did a cream cheese buttercream icing then covered in marshmallow fondant. WOW! This tasted great and was fun to decorate with the fondant flowers and leaves. This will go into my recipe book for sure.

Even with all of the customized ideas from the reviewers, the cake was difficult to time--the time on the recipe didn't cook it well enough--it stuck to the pan although the pans were greased, and even though I added more sugar, more cocoa--it was still quite bland.  Made it twice.  Not sure what happened--and the icing NEEDS to be refrigerated before applied.  It's very runny.

I gave it 4 because my husband ate it. He didn't tell me it was great. I used 3 tbsp Cocoa and 1 oz red food coloring. When I was rinsing the bottle I decided to add a little red water to the paste, because I know me and I would have never gotten that to mix. I did use oil and not shortening.

This cake is not as moist as I would have liked when I made it a few times as written. I followed other reviewers about the oil, except I added 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup pureed beets. The beets add great moisture, and also deepens the red color (I only used 1oz coloring) naturally. With the modifications, it is very delicious. The frosting is also scrumptious, but try melting 6oz of white chocolate into the milk and flour mixture! Extra good!

the frosting was excellent, to avoid a runny frosting you should cook the milk and flour very well and add it to the butter and sugar mixture very slowly and in steps to avoid it from splitting

The flavor of this cake was pretty good. However, the cake was too dry. I don't think the baking soda and vinegar was necessary. I used a different recipe for the frosting.

I made this cake substituting 1 cup oil and four tbsp on cocoa and thought it was fabulous, I've never had a traditional red velvet cake before only from cake mixes and with cream cheese frosting this is so much better it kind of has an old fashioned taste which is excellant.  I also used cake flour (still used the 2 1/2 cups).  Great recipe, worth the extra work!

This cake is wonderful. I used butter, one bottle of red food coloring, and this cake is moist, good raise, excellent texture. Yes, this is the correct recipe for the red velvet cake and it is perfect, not too sweet and it compliments it nicely. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I tried my hand at my first layers cake. I usually make small sheet cakes but I wanted to give this one a try. I made it yesterday for my boyfriends birthday. Red velvet is one of this favorites. I made it with the suggestions of 4 tbls cocoa, 1cup oil/1/2 shortening, and no vinegar. It turned out fine. I over filled my pans since I only had 8inch instead of 9s.  I will next time to a three tier. I think I will put the vinegar in next time to see if there is a difference. This was a little involved for me but I am better for trying. The frosting didn't come out right but it's my own fault for not cooking it long enough.  I mixed in butter cream already make frosting to make it fluffier. Everyone liked it so I will do again. I thought it was moist enough but I may try more oil next time. Enjoy this recipe and keep the comments coming to help baking novices like me!

I made this cake per the request of my 9 yr.old grandson and his mother for their birthday which happens to fall on the same date. I made it totally according to the given directions...except for using 3 8in cake pans. It turned out great and was absolutely delicious!!! Thanks so much for this recipe and particularly for the authenic Red Velvet icing.

The cake was fine, only used one bottle of food coloring and that was enough. I didn't care for this icing, however. I tried it because one reviewer said it was 'authentic'. It did not hold up well and had to be refrigerated at all times, even spreading it on the cake made it 'disintegrate'. Had a very odd texture and it didn't quite make enough to cover the cake. The flavor is okay, but was just to difficult to work with and the texture to weird to give it more than 2 stars.

This recipe was the first and only one I picked out to try from Allrecipes.  The cake turned out really moist.  I substituted the frosting for cream cheese frosting from another recipe in Allrecipes.  The cake turned out to be very moist.  We put leftovers in the fridge and it was still moist the next day!  Definitely a keeper.    I did make alterations recommended by other reviewers.  Substituted shortening for 1 cup of oil and put in 4 tbs of cocoa powder and only put in 2 tbs of red food coloring (the cake still turned up really red).

This cake is lovely as is - mine was not dry at all.  I did see a possible error in the recipe that may account for the issue: other red velvet cake recipes call for SIFTED flour rather than flour, sifted.  Sifting "fluffs" up the flour so that it measures differently.  If you are measuring 2.5 cups flour and THEN sifting, you are probably using too much flour.  Sift the flour first, then gently measure out 2.5 cups.   Also, for those of you who like cream cheese icing, I found this same icing recipe on the back of my cake flour box with a note that you could use 2 sticks (1c) butter OR 1 stick (1/2c) butter + 8oz cream cheese.  I haven't tried it, but it might be a nice compromise between the "traditional" and the cream cheese frostings.  I personally prefer the one included in this recipe - it is so light and fluffy and delicious.

Not as velvetty as I would have liked. Perhaps the addition of some buttermilk would be helpful.

this cake was super delicious! i like many of the reviews i read added more cocoa and used the 1 cup oil instead of the shortening. i guess if i didn't make those modification i would have given it 5 stars!   the frosting was SOOOOOOO good!!!! i doubled it because i frosted and decorated it. i did have some leftover...i migth try just doing it 1 1/2 times next time. it was a super hit! thanks so much for sharing!

WONDERFUL!!! I follow the recipe and it turns out perfectly every time. My boss LOVES this... he hires me to make it for every one of his special occasions. As long as it's not overbaked, will turn out perfectly, and the FROSTING... WOW!!

Ugh!! Made it twice, once exactly as written and once with all the modifications.  It came out tasting just fine but it had a huge dent in the middle.  All my ingredients were fresh and I have no idea what I did wrong...I've been making cakes for years and I've never had this problem before.  I'll probably try it again though...third times a charm?

I took the recommendations of a few reviews, I used 2 c. sugar, added a tablespoon of cocoa, and used veg. oil instead of shortening.  It was not to our liking!!!  I didn't even bother frosting it.

I've never heard of vinegar in a red velvet cake but it was pretty good, I love red velvet cake and I made a few adjustments. I used soy creamer, applesauce, and agave instead of the animal products and then skipped out on the frosting and used a vegan frosting. YUM! This is a keeper.

This cake comes out delicious and moist. I'm not sure why you have to mix all the ingredients seperately, but I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out excellent. Paired with a Cream Cheese Frosting and decorated to look like a Coffin, this cake was all the rave at my companies Halloween party.

Very good recipe, I do use a little more shortening, and I add a bit of almond extract to mine.  I am very pleased to see someone get the icing right!  A red velvet cake should never be frosted with cream cheese frosting!  It should always be frosted with a roux based butter cream.  Great recipe!

This Cake is perfect!!It turned out great and it was nice and moist. I think the way you made it is perfect, I go to alot of functions and partys and I always get request for this cake, and It turns out perfectly ever time, Nice and moist and the color is so pretty. However I have not tried to make the frosting all though I am sure it is great. I useually just do a cream cheese frosting, which every one loves on it!!With the Strawberrys. I think you should keep this recipe to the tee!!

i thought that this was really good, but i did take others advice and added more cocoa, and only used 1oz. food coloring and it turned out good. Next time i will sub oil for the shortening though. overall a great cake, i definately will make again.

This was an amazing cake. I got wonderful feedback from friends, family and co-workers (I brought the rest to work a couple days later). I doubled the cocoa, used 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of veg. oil instead of shortening. I also added one tsp of almond extract to the cake and 1/2 tsp to the frosting. I only used one red food coloring instead of 2 but filled the bottle with water to get the same texture the recipe called for - good move. The cake was moist and looked beautiful. My litte brother (27 yrs. old) said it would have been better with crystal sprinkles on the frosting for texture; I could see that :)

This cake looked great.  When I first tried it, I was disappointed, though.  It tasted sort of bland and flour-y to me--it didn't seem to even have a flavor.  The texture was moist and perfect, though.  After one day, however, the taste of the cake actually improved and it is quite scrumptious, now.  I did not like the frosting recipe, though.  It was too greasy and thin tasting--not rich and creamy enough.  I would make this cake again, though--with some extra cocoa powder and a different frosting:)

Im sorry but the cake was ok. It did come out a little dry. I dont know what I did wrong. I followed the directions completely and the icing still came out to a consistency that cannot be used to spread.

I made this cake twice with the extra sugar/cocoa and oil instead of shortening and it was so moist - I was really pleased with it - but, each time I made the cake, it hardly raised at all and once it was cool it had sunk a lot. It tasted great but it looks pathetic!

This was an awful recipe.  I followed the directions just as they are written.  I tasted the batter before I put it in the oven and it didn't taste as good as my chocolate cake.  After baking it and letting it cool, the cakes felt very heavy as I removed them from the 9" layer pans.  I was suspicious at that time.  I made the frosting that was recommended and when I tasted the frosting, it tasted like whipped cream and I was disappointed but thought maybe it would taste better when it was on the cake.  I served this cake to my family and they were gracious in giving me compliments but the cake and the frosting tasted terrible.  The cake was dry and heavy, and the frosting was too sweet.  I threw the rest of the cake away.

I made this w/ the substitutions (including cake flour)and made it "Blue Velvet Cake" for my son's birthday. The cake was delicious, moist, and tasty.

I didn't get the lumps out of the milk/flour mixture for the icing so it did not work out. It was not, however, runny, as some suggested. I cooked it long enough to make it mashed potato consistency, or more like oatmeal. I also cooled it plenty in fridge and it was not runny at all (the finished product) but had inedible little flour beads.

Question: when this recipe calls for food coloring, does it mean liquid or paste? I think the color in my cake was swirly on top because of the cocoa paste situtaion and the buttermilk idea sounds better. I used 3T cocoa, about .15 oz. liquid food color and about .5 oz. paste. It was very blue but brown/black in two corners. My paste was too thick.

I followed the recipe exactly and family loved it on Valentines Day. I think next time I will cut back on the food coloring and add more cocoa though as others have suggested. Kinda time consuming but I thought it was well worth it!

I only used the icing recipe off this recipe. It was excellent! My family loves red velvet cake and that specific icing. They know if I use a "fake" icing! I did use a box mix. They didn't care because the icing was SO good! % stars for the icing!

This recipe would be 5-star if not for the inexplicable decision to use a milk/butter/flour frosting instead a traditional cream cheese frosting.  For most people who like Red Velvet Cake, the cream cheese frosting is the most important part.  I wish Eleanor would tell me what's up with that, lol.  Great recipe, though -- I've used it many times coupled with either the Bourbon Cream cheese frosting or the frosting listed in Red Velvet Cake II.

It was alright.  All the guests loved it - I just wasn't wild about it.  I used 2 - 8" cake pans since that was all I had.  I needed to cook it about 10 min longer for it to cook through but doing that made the edges a little tough.  I think using the 9" may have fixed that problem.  I used the Cream Cheese II icing.  I have never had Red Velvet Cake, but my husband has and he said it tasted perfect minus the tough edges.

This cake was OK - I used the suggestions of the other reviews and substituted the 1 cup of oil instead of shortening and increased the sugar to two cups and the cake did not rise completely.  It tasted fine but I don't think I would make again.

This is a really good cake but it tastes nothing like the red velvet cakes I had when I was a kid in the south.    Also, I am used to cream cheese frosting.  I thought the frosting was OK but my husband loved it.

Awesome cake. Made it for my friend's birthday party and covered it in vanilla frosting. He was so suprised when he cut the cake open. Definately reccomend making this cake.

Made this for a Christmas party. It was a huge success. It was a beautiful cake to look at and a fabulously delicious cake to eat. I'm going to make it again for our Christmas dinner celebration.

I might even make it for Valentine's Day using heart shaped pans!

I tried this recipie for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit with everyone, especially the kids.  The frosting was the best I've ever tasted--I just made sure the milk and flour paste was VERY COLD before I blended it with the sugar.  It was creamy and not at all runny.  (I think the insructions call for 1 cup of flour and 5 tablespoons of milk for the icing, which couldn't be correct, so I reversed them and it came out beautifully.)  The cake wasn't as moist as some, but it was very dense and tasted great with the frosting.  Already I've been told that it's a "must" for Christmas.  It wasn't that difficult, just time consuming, but the kudos from family were worth it.

The icing isn't worth it.  It came out very drippy no matter what I did, and it looked clumpy and gross.  Next time I'lluse Best White Icing Ever or Bakery Shop Icing instead.

Thi is  my grandmothers recipe. It is exactly like hers.the only problem I had was I didn't flour the pan and the cake stuck terribly. So I remade half of the recipe and use the other two in a weird way and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe on the icing and have just enough.

This recipe is a keeper, I absolutely Adore it! This was made for a tea party, and every guest loved it and wanted more. I made the frosting from this link though. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-frosting-ii/
 Make sure you follow the directions, plan enough time to do this right, and DO NOT OVERCOOK. I checked on the cake about 5-10 minutes before I was supposed to, and found that it was completely done with the toothpick test. Fantastic Cake!

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  The cake looks very nice and great color.  No flavor and slightly crumbly (dry). Just not a cake I would ever make again! Not moist and flavorful.

It was good. I made red velvet for the first time ever with this recipe, and only have had red velvet cake 1 time before, so I thought it was pretty good, but not great. Then again I don't really know how its suppose to taste, but overall there wasn't anything special about it, but it did taste good and everyone enjoyed it.

This cake was awesome!! I didn't change a thing, and everyone loved it! I was a little skeptical about putting the milk and flour mixture into the frosting, but that really made the texture light and fluffy. I forgot to alternate mixing the buttermilk mixture in with the flour, but it came out great anyway. I will surely make this cake again.

My son requested a Red Velvet Cake for his 21st birthday celebration.  I read a lot of the reviews and on the advise of one of the reviewers who went into the science behind substitutions, decided to make it exactly as listed.  I split the 2 9" layers in half to make 4 layers and took the time to make the icing as directed.  It was wonderful.  I had tons of compliments and everyone wanted to know how the icing was made.  My opinion, if you use cream cheese icing, it is way too sweet.  Go classic and take your time and you will not be disappointed.

Incredible. Cake was moist, not to fluffy, not too dense. For the cake, I substituted 1 cup canola oil for shortening; 2 cups sugar instead of 1.5; doubled the cocoa powder. For the frosting I used half and half instead of milk and confectioner's sugar instead of regular sugar. My first try with the frosting turn into a mottled mess, with unappetizing curdles, this turned out to be because I hadn't cooled the cream and flour mix enough. The second time i tried it, I put the cream and flour mix in the freezer until it was very cold, but not frozen. The I mixed it very well and strained it. I added it to the butter and sugar mix bit by bit, until I had the consistency that I wanted (didn't use all of it), and it was delicious. The recipe doesn't state, but make sure that the butter is room temperature before you cream it with the sugar. Cutting it into small 1in cubes will help this a lot. And if you have to pop it in the microwave, do 5 secs at a time. 
Also of not, I used half of the recipe for cupcakes and the other to make a cake, cupcakes where just ok, I think 25mins was a little too much time for them, the cake though, cooked at 325 was phenomenal. Everyone raved about it. 
I have also made this recipe with Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was another success - doubled the sugar to cater to my sweet tooth. Cheers!!

Great recipe! I followed exactly as written and had no problems with it. I think you definitely have to carefully fold in the vinegar/baking soda mixture to allow for a light & airy cake. 

I only wish the frosting was a larger quantity. Next time I'll make a double batch of it, as I split my cake into four layers with the fluffy frosting in between each layer.

The cake was FANTASTIC. The icing was awful, it separated and I tried my absolute best to fix it after but I ended up having to make a cream cheese icing because this was so thin and wouldn't thicken. The cake was moist and delicious and got rave reviews. So overall good recipe just nix the icing!

I followed other people's substitution suggestions and also used chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder as I didn't have any.  Cake sunk in the middle (my fault, I'm sure, from over mixing).  Used the frosting recipe, thought it had curdled but read other reviews saying you need to mix for nearly 10 minutes.  Kept mixing and it came out great!
Just tried the cake - it's not dry, actually quite moist and the icing is wonderful.  
This was my first ever Kitchen Aid Mixer recipe so will try again and try to avoid the sinking!!

only 4 stars since I used the a fore mentioned changes and it was yummy. I'd use regular butter creme frosting as I'm not a chef and the cooking with flour just resulted in yucky floury lumps. but the cake was awesome and you really don't need two bottles of food coloring one is plenty, I brought it to work so I wouldn't eat it all myself. it was oohed and awed over.

I made the recommended alterations from the original recipe, batter was a little thick and cake was a little heavy, but delicious.  Used only an ounce of food coloring, (about 2.5 T Spoons) and the color was beautiful.  Also I used the coco powder to grease and dust the pans.  Cake needs to be lighter and fluffier, but will make again.

Edible, but I wouldn't serve it to anyone.  I'm really disappointed with this recipe; the cake turned out too tangy and was falling apart on the plate.  My husband said it tasted like play-doh.  I won't be making this cake again.  However, the icing turned out wonderfully.

slightly chewy, but turned out well with the oil and sugar changed per previous comments. Only one bottle of food dye needed, made it plenty red!

I am intrigued by the idea of making a red velvet cake, but then when I read that you actually have to add a full 2 oz of red dye (a quarter of a cup!) or even ONE full ounce for that matter, I get turned off.  That just seems so unhealthy, to add that much red dye to anything. And wouldn't it mean that eating it would stain your teeth/mouth, and anything the cake touched?

Like others, we used vegetable oil, and the cake still was dry. I will keep looking for the perfect Red Velvet cake recipe. The frosting was good, but didn't make enough for the cake.

This cake is DELICIOUS. The only qualm I had was that the icing recipe didn't quite make enough icing for my liking. I had to add shaved chocolate to the sides to cover up the lack of icing.

But otherwise, the cake turned out fabulous and had rave reviews from all who ate it! :)

This is one of my favorite cakes to make! They make amazing cupcakes too. The buttercream icing is definitely better than the usual cream cheese icing.

This recipe uses way too much colouring!  Made the recipe with changes recommended by other reviewers and I reduced the red colouring. Cake turned out bitter!  I'll never make this recipe again

This recipe was wonderful, but I think that it requires too much red food coloring and the frosting was too sweet for me.  I ended up having to make a cream cheese frosting using one package of cream cheese with a splash of milk, creamed until smooth, and one large container of whipped topping mixed until smooth.

I made a New Year's resolution to learn to bake this year.  This was my first try.  Boy was it a hit!!!!  I used the suggestions left by other users (oil instead of shortening, sugar, etc) and it was easy as pie!!! (Note to self... you should probably try a pie next and see how easy it REALLY is!).  Thanks for the recipe!!!!  And thanks for making my first time baking experience a wonderful one!

giving this recipe a 4 instead of a 5 because of all of the alterations I had to make. PLEASE take the other reviews advice on changes. Oh, and use real butter rather than margarine for the icing. it makes a world of difference!

I enjoyed this recipe. The cake tasted good but the frosting was too buttery. I would recommend adding more sugar to the frosting.

My husband and I made this cake for valentine's day. We had a great time making it, but neither of us had ever had a red velvet cake before and weren't sure how it was supposed to taste.
We followed the recipe except used oil instead of shortening. Although we mixed the cocoa with the food colouring to a paste the end result still yielded some brown spots.
Overall the cake is very moist, and stays moist for many days.

I think I did something terribly wrong. I tried making this into cupcakes, baking for 25 minutes at 325, as another reviewer suggested. I must have over-filled them, because they overflowed, and then sank down in the middles. I hope they taste good, because they look terrible.

Easy recipe to follow. But I found the criticisms of most reviewers to be true. The frosting was cottage cheese-like in appearance. Good flavor though. I also had swirls in the cake, crispy edges, and the flavor was a little bland. I'm willing to give it a second shot with modifications.

This is my FIRST CAKE EVER! so i didn't know what i did wrong, the recipes is only enough for one layer of 9 inch square pan. It was a very dense cake. It wasn't as good as my friend's red velvet recipe.  but my dad liked it ok. That's all that matter :)  I like the frosting! fluffy way without using too much sugar and butter. Instead of using somuch butter I substitute part of it with flaxseed. The frosting result is not pure white, I think it's more adorable than white. and I don't feel guilty eating it. it gives the frosting a bit of nutty feel.

The cake came out good for me.  I substituted pureed strawberries for the shortening, to add a little extra redness to batter, and it came out beautifully.    The frosting tastes delicious - very light, almost like a whipped cream frosting . It is, however, VERY runny and liquidy.  I used confectioners sugar and doubled the amounts and whipped it like I would whipped cream, and it stiffened up a bit, but I think next time I would cut back the milk by half or so.  Nice flavor though

I made this cake today and I am sure it was te best homemade cake I have ever made.  I gave it 4 stars because I changed something.  I used oil instead of Shortening.  But I think this cake was perfect!

I followed the suggestions of other people on this site and increased the sugar in the cake to two cups and the cocoa powder to 4Tbspns and while you could pick up the chocolate it wasn't over powering, which is how a red velvet should be...they are not red-dyed-chocolate cakes. However, I think I should have stuck to 1.5 c of sugar or maybe 1 3/4 because our cake was very sweet. I also substituted a cup of oil for the shortening and it was still dry. In fact, I over poured into my measuring cup and there was actually 1 and 1/8 and it was still dry and dense. I made it into cupcakes and it was kind of mouth full to chew. I prefer my cakes EXTREMELY moist, especially if I am not eating ice cream with them so next time I will increase the oil maybe to 1 and 1/4 cups. Also, while the batter was not hard to make the icing was a nightmare. I had fifteen minutes left on the timer when I started the icing and it took all that plus some to get the stuff to thicken. My grandma said while you do stir it over low heat, it will come to a simmer if not a boil before it thickens which is why you must continue to stir or you will get a clump of flour mess. Still when I added the butter it was so liquidy, there is no way it would stay on the cupcakes. The icing was also sweet. I guess next time I will thicken it even longer and add less sugar.

I am more the bakery cake buyer than cake baker so when I undertook the task of baking my daughter's favorite cake for her birthday I jumped in with LOTS of enthusiasm. Here were the problems. The cake was very dry. I did add both baking soda and powder to recipe. Cake was flat. Icing did not get very fluffy.  You could see all the little sugar crystal dots. It tasted wonderful but did not look too appealing. As I said I am not a baker. I think this would make a nice holiday treat and next years birthday cake will be stunning....Thanks! PS I hate to rate as I am sure this is a great recipe and the damage was due to my own hands!!

Would rate this higher if I could ever get it to come out right. I have been making this cake once a year for the past 25 years sometimes twice a year. Hubby's favorite and it looks so good at Christmas w/ 1/2 red and 1/2 green food coloring. But maybe its the high altitude in Colorado - but never seems to come out correctly!

I followed the instructions exactly, the cake is a little bland, will definitely add more cocoa next time, and perhaps follow with a creme de cocoa instead of vanilla. The color was beautiful and the milk buttercream was a pleasure to work with.

Four stars on the cake recipe! (Didn't use the frosting recipe, as I had been warned against it.)    Moist, easy to make, beautiful! Was a total crowd pleaser. I upped the cocoa amount as previously advised by other reviewers. Lovely.

Made this cake twice now. Once as written, once with most recommended modifications. The one with extra cocoa, oil & extra sugar was better, but still it was too dry for my liking.  I think I'll try a thrid time with more cocoa & more oil. I also used the gel coloring from Michaels and it gave a more uniform color. I did add 3tbsp milk with the cocoa/coloring misture to make it more of a paste and used 1/2 tsp of the gel coloring. GORGEOUS red color.

Delicious!  I had a hard time finding enough red food coloring as I didn't want to buy 8 boxes of the assorted colors at the grocery and the local specialty store was out of the normal red but I ended up using the red gel kind from Michael's and it turned out great!  I had to mix the dye and cocoa for a long time to make sure it wasn't lumpy like some other reviews mentioned.  But in the end it was fabulous and the frosting is a new favorite!  Easy to make and easier to work with!

I used the modified instructions of 1 cup of oil in place of 1/2 cup of shortening and 4 TBSP of cocoa powder. I also mixed in 1 oz of food coloring into the buttermilk. Otherwise, I followed the instructions as written. On the first run the cake was a bit dry even with the modification. The recipes is sensitive to temperture and bake time. Definitely not as forgiving as box mixes. The flavors of the cake was right on with the modifications.

I love cake, and this one didn't really impress me.  Following the suggestions of other reviewers I used 1c. oil instead of shortening, and 2 c. sugar, still found the cake to be a little bland and a bit on the dry side.  It wasn't over baked on my part as I watched it like a hawk.  oh well.

I made this using the modifications suggested by other reviewers (1 cup of oil instead of shortening and 4 tablespoons cocoa powder) as well and it turned out light and moist, and very tasty.  I did just put some vanilla buttercream frosting on it but I think next time I might experiment with something else.  This one's a keeper!

I followed the suggestions of adding more cocoa, 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of oil instead of shortening and I am finding the cake is still a bit bland. I made cupcakes with the recipe and I am going to ice them and take them to my friends place as dessert for the lunch she's making. Hopefully the icing brightens the flavour up a bit!

This was my first attempt at baking a cake from scratch and it turned out pretty good. I did follow some of the other reviewers substitutions with the 1 cup oil and increasing the cocoa to 4 T. My only problem with it was it did seem a little dry, so I think next time I will only bake it for 25 min and then check it, since 30 min was a bit too long.

light fluffy,and delish.  This icing is easy to make and tastes good if the cake is eaten quickly, but after a day or so the icing gets,... well hard to describe, but definitely less yummy.

I thought this cake was really good but I did follow some people's advice. I added an extra TBS of cocoa powder, 1 cup oil instead of shortening, and an extra 1/2 cup sugar. I also used a cream cheese frosting recipe. Everyone loved it!

I'm going to give this a 4 star, but I did follow the other suggestions from reviewer's, so I can't say about the original. I added 4 tbsp of cocoa powder instead of 2, 1 cup oil instead of shortening, 1 ounce red coloring, 2 cups sugar instead of 1.5, and 1 tbsp vinegar instead of tsp. The cake turned out really nice, I did have some brown swirls but it's not something that bothered me. It was moist and had a really good taste. The frosting I had some trouble with. It was very gloopy and had a really unappetizing look. I made this cake for 4 soldiers, and 1 of them was afraid to try it because of the frosting. When they ate it though they said that it was very delicious. Not your typical frosting, and though it didn't look very pretty and was very thin, it did taste good. I read other reviewer's say that it had a better consistency after being refrigerated several hours so I will have to try that next time, did not have time this time. Overall I would say use the recommended changes and it turned out very well. Thanks for the recipe!

Read other reviewer's tips before baking regarding the use of oil in place of shortening.  I make red velvet cake several times a year and resorted to this recipe when I couldn't find my usual one - I chose it because of the high rating.   This is the only cake recipe I've made in thirty years of baking that did not turn out well.  The flavor was good, but the cake would not "set" in the middle, resulting in a product that was overbaked on the edges.  I suspect it is the use of shortening in the recipe - perhaps results would be better if it were melted first.

The only thing about the recipe (and it might be that this particular cake/cupcakes are just not meant to be sweet) is that it is not sweet really.  Everyone still enjoyed them very much, but not very sweet.

My review is only for the frosting because I used a different cake recipe.  This is the type of frosting I remember eating on red velvet cake growing up in NY ("Waldorf Asotoria" style red velvet cake).  The first time I made it,  followed the recipe but thought it was a little too stiff. I saw other recipes that varied the amount of flour, so on my second attempt I settled on 3 Tbs.  I whisked together the Milk and flour (1 Tbs at a time) to make sure there were no lumps.  I heated the mixture until it boiled, stirring constantly.  I also increased the vanilla to 1.5 tsp, but I love vanilla.   It was perfect and not grainy at all.  I am a buttercream snob and hate he type made with butter and confectioner's sugar (too grainy, too sweet, and I can taste the cornstarch).  Usually I make one of the egg-containing variants, but this is just as good!

I have been looking for a recipe for Red Velvet Cake that doesn't taste like a vinegar cake for 5 years.  Thank you.  This is the one.  It turned out beautiful and very tasty.  I did mix the chocolate, food coloring and the buttermilk mix all together. No streaks, great uniform coloring.

Made this with the changes that were most noted in reviews.  added 4tbls. cocoa powder 1/2 regular 1/2 dark choc. Yummy! did the oil and more sugar.  added full 2oz. of red color and it was rather dark, next time i'll use maybe 1oz or 1 1/2oz.  the cake was delicious as was the frosting!  my 11yr. old son and i made this for his Birthday party for the family and they all loved it as well..only a few pieces left over which isn't usually the case!

i give this one four stars because yes it was delicious but i still got the chocolate swirl in the cake even though i made sure i mixed it before hand. not to mention the shelf life of this cake is less than one day. it was delicious if you eat it right away. but i will continue to look for a loner lasting cake1

I read all the reviews and everything, but decided to go ahead and make the recipe as is. It was made for a friend's birthday and it was a hit! My only complaint was that it wasn't as chocolately as I would have liked and it seemed tough, not nearly as moist as I think it should have been. In the future, I believe I will increase the sugar, cocoa, and substitute oil for the shortening as suggested.

I made this cakes using the recommendations of the other users, (like so many of you did), and it turned out really tasty. I made 24 cupcakes like another user did. I was however disappointed that they were very flat, and some sunk in in the middle. Kind of strange. I did exactly what you all said to do, with the 1 cup of oil and 2 cups of sugar. I also used 3 tbsp of cocoa. They tasted FANTASTIC though and they were all gone before I even got to eat one. Thankfully, I did get to try one when my 3 year old brought me hers with the icing all licked off. LOL!

Pretty good. I liked the taste it was different. Mine didn't turn out very red though but thats because I didn't know how much 2 oz of red food colouring was, so I just added all I had which wasn't nearly enough.

I just finished making this cake and though it looked rather delicious, the taste was kind of bland. I also attempted to make the icing and it turned out to be a yellow liquid goop. I don't think I'll be following this exact recipe in the near future.

I'm a pretty good cook, but I'm no baker.  I was quite pleased with this recipe - moist, big chocolate flavor, and nice body.  I did go with 3T of cocoa powder and skipped the vinegar.  Where things didn't turn out so well was with icing - to that, I suggest reading the instructions...don't combine and heat all of ingredients on the stove :-/  I was able to save the icing with substantial chilling in an ice bath and a little extra flour.  Nobody complained, in fact, it was compliments all around.

I was hoping to find a red velvet cake that was red, like the picture.  I used a lot of wilton's red food coloring but the cake still looked chocolate not red.  Was making it for Valentines Day Brunch at church.  All the lady's loved them, but I thought they were a little dry.  Won't be making this one again!

Best RV cake recipe I've found.  It is so rich, I only crave it now and then.  I will try a different icing though as I didn't care for this one.

I made this cake three times, and am basing my review on the first prep, when I followed the recipe exactly. It was all right, but it wasn't quite what I wanted. I wanted more of a pronounced cocoa taste and it was a little dry. The second time I made it, I substituted 3/4 cup canola oil for the shortening, decreased the red food coloring to one ounce, and increased the cocoa to 4 Tablespoons. Remembering what another reader posted about streaky chocolate, I mixed the cocoa with the dry ingredients and mixed the red food coloring with the buttermilk. It was much simpler this way, and was exactly what I wanted. The frosting listed above might be traditional in most of the US, but for better or worse, in my part of the US, red velvet cake is served with cream cheese frosting, so that's what I made the second and third times. The "traditional" cooked frosting turned out just fine, and I liked it, but the woman who requested red velvet cake wanted cream cheese, so cream cheese she got.

This recipe is great.  I had this same recipe, passed down to me.  I lost it, but knew the ingredients, just couldn't remember how much of what.  Even the frosting, as weird as it sounds.  This is the same recipe that has been in the family forrrrevver and I am so glad I found it. Love it

I made this  cake for my sons birthday at his request and he loved it. It was a hit. Better than past attempts though I was hoping for a moister, denser cake it was light and tasty and the icing was very  flavorful.

After reading the reviews for this cake, i used my fantastic cake recipe instead of trying to make all the revisions. But due to the lack of cream cheese, i made the "traditional" frosting. I followed the recipe for the frosting to the letter. You do use granulated sugar, but you have to follow directions and beat until the mixture is creamy. It does take several minutes of beating the tisugar and butter for it to lose its grainy texture, so be patient. the milk and flour part of the recipe was, pardon the pun, a piece of cake, again be patient. if you follow the directions, trust me, it will come out fine. And although it was quite good, my family prefers a cream cheese frosting. like my husband said, with this frosting you want to eat it on the cake; with cream cheese frosting you want to eat the frosting first! hope thise helps someone!

I added the extra 1/2 cup sugar and the extra tablespoon of cocoa as suggested. This cake was good, but a little dry. I think I might have overbaked it by a few minutes.

I only used the icing recipe. It turned out horrible. I think (but am not sure) that the "white sugar" is suppose to be powdered sugar. I used white sugar and it was a runny mess. Does anyone know if the recipe is wrong???

Fantastic! I grew up with this recipe, but always hesitated to make it due to endless amounts of folding. This recipe was much easier since I used a mixer and only had to fold the last step. When cooking the flour and milk, I like a thicker frosting, so cook until it's almost a paste and then place in the fridge to cool. Tastes great days later if stored in the fridge. Mom and Nana were thrilled to see someone improve on the family cake.

This was great! I did omit the vinegar since the recipe calls for buttermilk. I also added 3 tablespoons cocoa, and only used 1 ounce of red food coloring (I ran out). Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my daughter's birthday and it was probably the best red velvet cake I have ever had. The icing MAKES the cake. I have always made a frosting that takes 15 minutes to mix but is not cooked. No more. This is wonderful!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used the modified 1 cup oil, 2 cups sugar and 4 Tbsp cocoa, and I tried to make cupcakes. Tried. I am a very good cook, but something in this recipe did not work at all, the cupcakes had flat tops, were covered in giant holes like pancakes and tasted pretty bad. I suspect that there was some problem with the acid base ratio between the vinegar/cocoa/baking soda, but I don't really care to try this again and figure it out. Lets just say I am over my urge to try making a red velvet cake and will save my pretty frosting for something else tomorrow!

This cake is messy and putzy, but it's gorgeous and delicious.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations to use more cocoa powder (4 Tbsp) so I increased the sugar a bit as well (1 3/4 C).  I made three layers (baked them for 20 min at 325 for dark nonstick pans) and they were done but didn't turn out easily, so I would definitely grease AND flour the pans next time, or use parchment paper.  Humidity may have been a factor.  There wasn't quite enough frosting to do the sides, but it was pretty with frosting just between the layers.

This recipe is good!  I also elected to use a cup of oil in lieu of the shortening, 2 cups of sugar rather than just the cup-and-a-half, and omitted the vinegar all together.  I baked the cakes in a 9-inch round cake pans (lined with parchment paper) for 40 minutes at 325 degrees F.

I must be one of the lone crazy folks who doesn't like their tongue to be red after eating red velvet cake, so rather than use two 1-ounce bottles of red food coloring, I used one.  To compensate for the loss of liquid, I filled up the empty bottle with water and then used that water in place of the extra bottle of color.

The last modification I made was to use cinnamon buttercream frosting.  It's still a traditional roux-based frosting, but it's whipped with a teaspoon of vanilla and two teaspoons of cinnamon.  You can find it on Martha Stewart's website (many apologies to AllRecipes.com).

Overall, the cake could have been a wee bit more moist.  I didn't have a terrible problem with crumbs when I torted it.  I think I'll ask my mom for her red velvet recipe, but I'm sticking to the cinnamon buttercream!

This is the first layer cake I've made but it turned out great despite lack of experience (it's pretty simple!).  After reading a review I added only 1 oz of food dye and that was definitely enough.  I also didn't make the frosting (just bought some) so I can't speak for that, but the cake was delicious.

I was a little leary but followed the directions as listed (except added 2 Tbsp extra cocoa as I love cocoa).  This recipe was FABULOUS!  The frosting is THE BEST EVER!  I love cream cheese frosting but I am so glad I gave this a try.  It compliments the cake wonderfully!  Thanks for a new recipe.  Will use it again and again!

I made a few changes that others suggested, including substituting 1 C of oil for the shortening and increasing the sugar to 2 C.  I also used 5 (yes, 5!) tbsp. of cocoa for an extra-chocolatey flavor.  I experienced the same problem another reviewer had with the baking time:  after 30 minutes in the oven at 350, the center of the cake was only starting to cook.  I noticed that another reviewer cooked hers for 50 minutes, so I increased the time and crossed my fingers.  The result?  After 45 minutes only the outer part was done, so I covered the pan with foil to prevent burning and put it in for another 15.  I'm not sure what would cause this problem;  I'm not a very experienced baker but I usually don't have this issue with other recipes (or store-bought mixes).  A bit confusing there.

Also, I'm not sure what the frosting debate is all about...it must be regional preference whether to put one kind or another on the finished cake.  Just go with what YOU like!  Myself,  I didn't use the recipe that went with the cake, and rather, used a store-bought kind (buttercream) as a time-saver.

The flavor was intense, chocolatey, and delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, I'm not certain I'd make this recipe again due to the mediocre results I had this time with so much effort.  Four stars for great flavor but unreliable results...

I used 1c oil and 2c sugar and 4T cocoa like everyone suggested. I baked in a Wilton butterfly pan (for my baby's first birthday!) that accommodates a 2-layer cake and the edges got crusty/chewy. I covered those with foil so the middle would bake. This cake is very heavy and not very flavorful. (The best part was the chewy parts!) I've had RV only once before, and it probably was a box, but that was way better than this. I used whole milk and 'white sugar' for the frosting and got the typical grainy runny disgusting mess after beating for ages. I frosted with it anyway and was also a bit embarrassed to serve it. After mixing food coloring in to decorate the butterfly, the color melted down, leaving lumpy globs of butter sitting on yellow puddles. Really quite disgusting. The frosting tastes okay, but for 2 sticks of butter it should be fan-freaking-tastic to merit eating. If it should be superfine or powdered, the recipe should be changed. I keep eating the leftovers because the pie filling I put in the middle is so good, but I should really throw it away and eat candy instead for how rich, fatty, and not tasty this cake is.

I made this cake for my birthday.  I ended up substituting a 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup grapola oil instead of the shortening (shortening grosses me out).  I used an extra 1/2-teaspoon of cocoa and blue food coloring instead of red ("blue velvet cake").  For the icing, it tasted a bit too sweet and thin (probably the skim milk I had), so I added about 4oz of cream cheese and a quarter cup of confectioner's sugar.
It looked weird, but everyone gobbled it up and completely ignored the chocolate cake with fudge icing.

The cake was great after I read others' reviews and changed the original.  That's why I am only giving it three stars.  I also used 1 cup of oil instead of shortening and added sugar.  I would probably change it more after making it but it did turn out fairly well...oh and I extended the time to 35 minutes

I took other reviewers' advice and substituted the oil for shortening and increased sugar to 2 cups. After 30 minutes in the oven my cakes were still  as runny as water in the middle! I kept them in another 10-15 minutes after which time the edges were crispy critters and when I took them out of the oven, the middles sunk to about an inch thick. I was VERY disappointed with this not so great recipe!

This is my boyfriends favorite cake.  I decided to surprise him for his birthday and make one from scratch.  I took others suggestions and upped the cocoa powder to 3 TB and downed the food coloring to 1 oz.  The cake turned out great, except that it stuck to the pan.  Next time I would flour the pan too.  Now the frosting was another story.  The first time around, I used skim milk and when I mixed the flour/milk mix into the sugar/butter, it completely came apart, was greasy and curdled looking.  Sooo, I started over with whole milk, let the flour/milk mix chill completely, and voila! AWESOME FROSTING.  My boyfriend and his son ate the extra with a spoon - - and then requested me to make another batch of just frosting!

i made this cake for a ladies party. the cake i did following the reviews from other members by adding 1 cup oil,2 cups sugar,4 tbspn cocoa. i didnt use vinegar. after baking it for 30 min the cake was done but dry with a big crack on top.i used a cake leveler to level the top.i baked the cake in a single big round pan instead of 2, 8 inch pans.the icing was definitely the best. i added pink and yellow colours to it and iced the cake. i also added 1/2 can of mixed berry pie filling between the layers and sprinkled some sugar.it was a hit with my friends and  after seeing this cake i have recieved 2 orders for making birthday cakes.the taste of the cake improved with the icing and pie filing.

The cake was alright. No wild raves. I made the icing though and it was so grainy. All in all it was edible, but I wont make it again.

This recipe gets 4 stars from me only because it is freaking IMPOSSIBLE to make the stuff.  I didnt do the cake very well the first time, but it was GREAT the second time. I tried 5 different times to make the icing after reading the advice here over and over and over again, and I just cant do it.  It tastes absolutely wonderful but it separates and its liquidy and it totally ruined my cake when I put it on there.  Very dissapointing.  If I could get the recipe right it would be divine- but 4 stars for a cake only a true expert should be making! BAKER BEWARE.

This is a great recipe.  I added another 1/2 TB of cocoa and it had a great chocalate flavor.  You can vary the chocolate to suit taste.  The cake itself was moist but held together well.  I used the recipe to make 9 individual train molds for my ds 4th birthday and thus only baked it 20 minutes until just done.  The cake was a great color.  I did not use the icing as I needed a piping icing for decorating.

I did this cake for my birthday, and I had to make some adjustments because I didn't have buttermilk so I just melted some butter and mixed it with milk, I think this made the cake to moist, because the cake broke(the top,it was a two layer cake) when I added the cherry topping but the cake was delicious I will defintly try again with buttermilk to se how it turns out. It was amazingly moist and flavorfull. LOVED IT! Thanks!

I was actually quite surprised that the cake turned out GREAT n MOIST! Believe it or not, this was my first time baking!!!! I'm so proud of myself.
I did not really follow the actual recipe, I substituted certain items as suggested by some reviewer(highly recommend that). Definitely a keeper recipe!!

The first time that I made this cake the flavour was not as nice as I expected however, the second time that I made it, I replaced the shortening with butter and the results were fantastic. I'll be using this recipe all the time from now on.

I followed TLBRAN's modifications, but only used one ounce of the red food coloring. The color of the cake came out well, but even though I used four tablespoons of cocoa powder, it didn't come out as chocolatey as I wanted it. I would mix the cocoa powder with the buttermilk next time. The cake was moist and very easy to make. I'll make it again, but with more chocolate.

I followed the directions and the cake turned out good, it wasn't anything to rant and rave over, but it was okay. It had a beautiful color, and it tasted like pretty good. I didn't use the frosting recipe, maybe I just don't know how to thicken milk, but my frosting was a butter and milk liquidity mess. After two tries with the frosting I decided to use a butter cream frosting recipe instead. That turned out well, and really brought the cake together. I don't know if I would make this cake again, I might look for other recipes.

This wasn't bad, but the recipie calls for WAY too much red food coloring, I put in a little less than 1 oz and it was already getting scary. The cake ended up coming out a dark reddish-brown, and I made it into a bundt cake. The frosting was delicious!! I will definetly use the frosting for other cakes!

Followed the alterations like everyone else suggested; doubled the cocoa, increased sugar to 2 cups; used 1 cup of oil in place od shortening; increased vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. and increased vinegar to 1 tbsp.
When sliced, the centre of the cake was red, however the top, bottom and edges were brown.

I made this using the changes indicated in other reviews, and it came out pretty well. Baked up nice and fluffy in the oven. I only had .25 ounce of red food coloring, but that still made the cake fairly red. (I can't imagine what 2 ounces would have looked like!) I made this with the chocolate cream cheese icing in the frostings and icing section, and it went very well together. Not my all time favorite cake, but good for a change.

This cake is the perfect combination of cake and icing.  The cake by itself wouldn't stand alone, because it isn't particularly sweet.  So the texture and sweetness of the icing completes the cake.  I've already made it twice!

This did not come out very well.  I'm sure some of it was my inexperience.  Next time I will use cake flour rather than regular flour and buy icing rather than trying to make it.

I made this for Valentine's Day and it came out beautifully.  A really nice color and most people have never heard of red velvet cake so it always gets a great reaction.  I didn't make the frosting because I didn't want to keep the cake in the fridge, store bought vanilla worked fine.

This cake is a big hit with those who remember the old red velvet cake of their childhood.  The consistency was good and flavor OK.  Not extremely moist, but adequate.  I had poor luck with the icing and pitched it in favor of a traditional butter icing which was fabulous on it.  It's the look and the nostalgic value that really take the cake.

Although the cake is a hassle to make, it sure is worth it. I found it to be very delicous. This is my first time making this cake and it turned out excellent. I didn't use the recipe for the cream cheese frosting, I used a different one, and sad to say it burn my blender out because it was so thick in the beggining. I have now decided to only make this cake only once a year, and that will be for the holidays. Although it is great, it's a hassle. I would make it year round otherwise.

I was looking for a recipe that would closely match the red velvet cake we had made for our wedding.  This was not it. I dont know what happened, I followed everything exactly, but my cake turned out dry and tasted like a cake mix.

The cake itself was fine. The frosting, on the other hand, was just plain awful. It had a consistency like watery cottage cheese and tasted as much. Do yourself a favor and just use a different frosting/icing recipe.

This is an excellent old, tried and true recipe!  It is the classic recipe for the 1950's "Waldorf red cake" with the classic traditional and perfect compliment, ermine icing. ( I would NEVER cover up the wonderful flavor of this cake with cream cheese icing which should only be used on spice cakes.)

My mom began making the "Waldorf red cake" in the late 50's and I learned to make it from her.  The only change I have made to the recipe is increase the cocoa to 1/4 cup.

Folks, Red Velvet Cake is NOT a chocolate cake! My traditional recipe, very close to this one, uses 1 T vinegar and only  1 T cocoa. It is there for color! My grandmother’s recipe uses 2 sticks butter, buttermilk, full 2 c sugar,  otherwise about the same.  Take the time to make the traditional icing given here!!  Don’t melt the butter but have soft and cream the sugar and butter very very well. If butter is softened, you don’t need powdered sugar!  Make sure the cooked flour/milk (my recipe uses only 1 T flour) is completely cooled before adding and let it whip a good 5 mins!  Those who said icing was runny must have added warm milk/flour mixture!  This comes out like a thick whipped cream and so delicious.  My recipe adds 1 c coconut and 1 cup chopped pecans.  I used to double icing recipe so lots between layers, but yesterday i just did one recipe to be a teeny bit less decadent.  My cake is made in 3 8” layer pans.  This is a “real, traditional RVC!” It is supposed to be a dense cake, not light and airy.  Give it a try and take time to make the “real” icing.  It is fantastic.

I made this cake with Bob Red Mills 1 to 1 gluten free flour. I followed the exact recipe and the cake was perfect.  I really like the icing and will be using it on other cakes. You have to be very patient when you are making the icing. You need to cook the flour and milk over a low heat stirring constantly. I mixed the flour and milk well before placing it on the burner. I thickened it until it resembled porridge ( without the lumps ). When it cooled I beat it for a couple of minutes with the butter mixture. The consistency was perfect for icing the cake.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I just made this cake and the recipe is perfect as is.  I made and used cream cheese frosting instead of the version included. This will be in the regular rotation of homemade desserts.

I made this with most of the ingredients with specified measurements. I added 2 cups of sugar and used butter instead of shortening. I added 2 tbsp. of cocoa powder.  But it was super dense like corn bread. Idk , maybe I need to use less flour or more buttermilk . Also only used 1 oz of red coloring and the color was flawless. Its good the second day after sitting under frosting.

I followed the advice of another commenter and added 1 T extra cocoa, used 1 C veg oil instead of shortening, and 2 C sugar. It did need to be cooked for a longer time because of the extra moisture, but it was delicious!

Made a few small tweaks (1/4c extra shortening and another pinch of sugar along with adding 1 TBS of cocoa), but this was a big hit and was so moist and delicious!

I have not and will not make this recipe, but wanted to say to those who gave it a 4 or 5 star rating BECAUSE you changed a bunch of things - you were no longer rating this recipe. Changing out the shortening for a cup of oil and adding more sugar makes it a different recipe.

Being pressed for time, I used the Simple White Cake recipe from this site and added the red food coloring. 
I left out the cocoa and made a Texas Chocolate Frosting.
I made this for a family get together and it disappeared.

I've been baking for over 40 years, and this was not a great recipe as it is written, which makes me think there must be some difference in how the original submitter goes about their process than what I do.  I haven't done any experimentation with it, I'll just look for another recipe I think. 

If you want to try it, take a look at the changes others have made and consider them before you invest your time.

I made the cake only (used another recipe for the icing). I followed the recipe exact and it came out very dry.  Definitely was not very tasty at all.  I used gel food coloring so the cake never turned red.  Luckily I used a great Cream cheese icing recipe that made the cake edible.  Next time I'll try another recipe.

Like most reviewers, I made 1 adjustment. I Increased the chocolate from 2 to 4 tbsp. The chocolate flavor was excellent (Trader Joe's brand).  My problem was overcooking :(
I  left it in the oven a little too long and it was a bit dry. I will try again and try the frosting. I used the traditional cream cheese frosting.

I used the 1 c oil and 2 c sugar. Made a little village and used simple icing over the top. I tried using cocoa for some to prep the molds and flour for others. I like the four better. More detail. Also, I ended up with muffin tips because the cake really rose in the cups. Very good flavor. I used 1 oz red coloring. They're very dark red.

This did not turn out well at all. It was a tough non moist cake and there was a odd cocoa  taste through out the entire thing. The icing I messed up, by not cooking the milk/flour mixture long enough,  (Otherwise it probably would of turned out well). Overall I should have definitely read the reviews of the other members before having done it.

My mom has made this recipe for over 50 yrs... few differences, 2 1/2 flour,  1 tbsp of vinegar etc.  I made it years ago and it flopped.  Thinking I was inexperienced, I tried it again at age 55.. FLOP again!  I KNOW the recipe works... MOM does it.  I am a FOODS teacher and not sure the reason.  I left the house with my daughter in charge to get it our.  I am thinking our oven is cutting on and off... so I am thinking this is the problem.  Off to make another KIND of cake and see if oven is the culprit!!

I made this to have an "adult" flavored cake at a children's party, it was loved by all who tried it! I attempted to make it dark purple and epicly failed at so it turned out brown! Not the recipes fault... just saying that because I don't know how the color would have turned out otherwise..probably ok.  I included some suggestions from the other reviewers about adding a couple extra tablespoons of coco powder and used the non traditional cream cheese frosting. DELISH!!!  It is a very rich, dense and moist cake. Very tasty!

First time, I made this recipe exactly as written; icing and all. The icing was tasty but it was too liquid and not very appealing. The cake itself was moist and delicious! I swapped out the icing for my own cream cheese icing recipe the other times, and it paired well with the cake.
5* for the cake, 2* for the icing.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it came out so yummy!  I bake so many cakes, and wanted to try this.  Those people who modify it, then rate either themselves or the original recipe after modifications make my life so hard!  Just add a new recipe if yours is that good!  Now, its time for CAKE!!  Lol

I made this cake and the cake itself was delicious and easy.
The frosting, however, was horrible. Even after half a canister of powdered sugar it was liquidy and by then sickly sweet. I chilled it, hoping to harden it but it didn't help. I will make it again, probably , but with cream cheese frosting which is not nearly so sweet.

First time making a red velvet cake, a flour roux, a 4 layer cake, and that kind of frosting. I set the oven timer at 20 minutes and the toothpick came out very wet. I gave it another 5 and it came out totally dry. Next time; 22 minutes in oven will probably be enough. The batter looked red all across, but when it came out of the pans, the bottom part was brownish. I read multiple reviews after the facts, next time I'll put 1 once of food colouring only, and in the buttermilk as suggested. 

The frosting was very difficult to get to a nice texture. I doubled the recipe because I had four layers to frost. I left the butter out at room temperature at least 2 hours before creaming it with the sugar. I let the kitchen aid run for at least 5 minutes at high speed. Then I poured the flour roux mix, which I had put in the fridge at some people's recommendation. I mixed it very well, for at least 5 minutes at high speed. The texture looked great. 


I had frozen the cake layers. I had just enough frosting to cover everything, but it was difficult to spread and it seemed too granulated. I ran across 2 small lumps of butter that hadn't mixed probably, I removed those. All-in-all, the cake was very good, everyone enjoyed it. I'm looking forward making another with the new found knowledge I now have!

Made this for my sister's birthday dessert. First time making a red velvet with traditional icing (vs cream cheese)  and I have to say the taste was yummy!!! I modified the cake recipe as others suggested (more oil, sugar) but kept the rest the same. The icing has a wonderful flavor!!! I let the milk/flour mixture cool completely before going to the next step. Easy to frost the cake with. Will make again!!

I had never made a red velvet cake before and I actually had never eaten one before this and...WHAT AN INTRODUCTION!!!! I served this cake for the first time when we had guests over for dinner in early January. It's the end of March they still remember how amazing it was! So does my family. Hubby requested it for his birthday in February and my daughter ate her whole slice and asked for more...she never eats my cakes! Thanks for this amazing recipe and I look forward to sharing one as worthy with this great community someday soon. Next on the list Black Forest another first and I can't wait!

I made this cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day this year. He, his mother, and his friends LOVED it! It was my first time making a red velvet cake and I am very happy it turned out successful! I used the Special Buttercream Frosting for this recipe instead of the recipe for frosting that was originally provided.

I have a few comments on making it though. If you don't have buttermilk on hand, I suggest adding 1 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 cup of milk, mix that in, and let it sit for 5 minutes. It should have the same consistency as buttermilk (I promise you.) Also, my tip for those who want a very moist cake, add some instant pudding when you sift your flour (I used CAKE FLOUR for this recipe). Or for a moist cake, to your batter, add sour cream. 

I hope this helps for those who are having trouble! Have fun baking!

I love this recipe - I make this low carb with Carbquick and Stevia and frost with a low carb crisco frosting (also made with Carbquick) and the results are always tasty. I have made this many times and the cake is always consistently delicious  - Even my sugar eating friends request my low carb version of this cake.

The cake was absolutely AMAZING after substituting 1 cup oil for shortening 1/2 cup shortening, 2 cups sugar for 1 1/2 cups sugar, and adding an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder, which was what several other people recommended. However, the icing recipe simply did not taste good to me. I didn't have time to try out another icing recipe so I had to use store bought icing. Other than the icing though, the modified cake was perfect.

Finally! A REAL red velvet cake! A red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting is good, but nothing special. This cake with the butter frosting - wonderful!! This is very similar to our old family recipe, but my mother always made it in three layer pans, then sliced each layer through, to make six very thin layers. Then with this wonderful buttery icing in between each layer, ohhh -so good!

This is a great recipe. I used the advice of another review and perhaps i might add a half cup of mayo next time for the moisteness. I made my own cream cheese and my 90 year grand mother and my husband loved every bit of it... even the crumbs!

I liked the outcome although it was my first time with a Red velvet; my in laws don't prefer much sweetness, therefore it was ideal for them, and it was moist and dense. I used the cream cheese frosting for frosting, and it added the right amount of sweetness. It's a different flavor altogether, probably because I used mandarine juice to make the sour cream ;) but my family liked it :) And my daughter (5 yr old) loved the colour and the cream cheese frosting!!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!! I would have rated it 5star if there was a little more flavor to it; and a tad more of sweetness... probably that's the original flavor, but I'd make it a little sweeter next time :)

This was my first attempt on the red velvet, and I shouldn't have tried this for a present on the first try. It is not forgiving at all. I did increase the sugar by 1/2 cup and only put in 1 oz of red food coloring as the reviews suggested, and I used dutch-processed cocoa powder (I knew that the color wouldn't turn out right, but I didn't have the regular kind). The batter had a funny odor before baking (probably due to the vinegar), and while it went away after baking, the result didn't smell much better. The smell, along with the cocoa ribbons all over the cakes, reminded me of cheap dessert-scented candles. Although the recipe says to bake the cakes for 30 minutes, my batch took a little longer, with one of the cakes getting baked at 40 minutes and the other somewhere between 46 and 48. The latter was over-baked as I took it out of the oven at a 50-minute mark and it showed: an inch-thick dry, tough ring. Both of the cakes did have a thin crust on top. I tasted a broken bit of the crust, and the cake was flavourless. Just saccharine. I am now frantically searching for a quick cake recipe as a replacement.

Loved this recipe!!!  I used cake flour, instead of all-purpose, as I had it on hand and made the equivalent substitutions (1 c. + 1 TBSP. cake flour= 1 c all-purpose).  I also substituted sour milk (1c. Milk + 1 TBSP vinegar. Let sit 5 min. til curdled, mix, then measure correct amount of required milk.). Came out perfectly moist and had a nice crumb.  I doubled the frosting and had plenty left over.  Will definitely add this to the family favorites file!

I followed the recipe and suggestions to the tee, the cake was terrible. It was chewy and heavy, very bland flavor, so the modifications others made did nothing to help the original recipe.

Excellent cake! I made as directed, except used (nontraditional) cream cheese frosting. Thanks for the awesome recipe!
Edit 2/13/16:  Consistently good and moist. I always bake cupcakes - take them out after 15 minutes. Forget the fussy steps in all these recipes. Just mix the cocoa and baking soda into the flour, and the food color and vanilla with the buttermilk. Voila, NO STREAKS. Stir in the vinegar last. It's foolproof  and much easier.

I was looking for a recipe for red velvet cake for a co-workers birthday. I gave this one a try. I followed it exactly. It came out great! She said it was one of the best she's had! Mine was not dry at all. I did not try the frosting recipe, but the cake was excellent.

Good flavor. It didn't rise as well as I would have liked. I modified the recipe as suggested by other users, replacing the shortening with oil and using 2 cups of sugar. I'll likely make it again.

The cake itself was good, although I followed other reviewers advice and subsitituted 1 cup of oil for the shortening and increased the sugar to 2 cups.  I made the icing, and was very disappointed. I followed the recipe to the letter, only to find it was a soupy mixture that didn't thicken despite every effort. Luckily I had ingredients for cream cheese icing on had, although it's not my personal favorite.  Great cake, awful icing!

Based on suggestions, I used 1 cup oil instead of the shortening, and added an extra half cup of sugar. I also added 1-2 extra tablespoons cocoa powder. I did not use the 1 teaspoon white vinegar, figuring the buttermilk would be sufficient. It turned out very good. The frosting, while delicious, took a lot of time for the consistency to become even close to spreadable.

These did not turn out for me. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but they were quite bland. After about two days, they went bad and tasted like sour milk. I may have done something wrong, but I feel sure I followed the recipe. Hope others have better luck with this!

My friend asked me to make this cake for his early birthday celebration since he tried this once while travelling south and fell in love with it . Had no clue what it was, but being the authentic from scratch baker I looked around for a recipe. This was perfect (as he says) in texture, subtle taste, lightness and shape. The only different thing I did was add more coco powder and oil substitute for shortning.

This recipe is great. I made the recommended adjustments of using oil instead of shortening, and added a bit more coco. I didn't add the extra sugar, and found the flavor great. As for the icing, I used the recipe listed and it was amazing. Such a great flavor. It wasn't chilled so it didn't look that great, but the flavor definitely made up for the appearance!

I used the following subs; oil instead of shortening, 1 oz red food coloring and 4 tbsp of cocoa powder.  After cooking the cake for 30 minutes, the middle was still liquid. I cooked it for another 10 minutes and the toothpick still came out wet. Another five minutes and the cake was done.  I use the cream cheese frosting II after the cake cooled. I've never had red velvet cake before but am experienced at making cakes. The frosting was delicious buy practically over-whelmed the cake flavor. I tried the cake later, without the frosting and it didn't taste like anything special. It wasn't dry but it wasn't moist as others claim. I just don't see what all the fuss is about.

I must have done something wrong. The icing tasted like sweet grease, and the cake a little dry. Also, it had brown swirls even though I mixed the coloring very well.

On the day I baked it the cake tasted a 3.5 star. After leaving it overnight in the fridge it was pretty tasteless the next day. I did double the cocoa :-( Not sure what I did wrong.

This is the best red velvet cake icing recipe I have ever used.  It tastes wonderful and is nice and fluffy.  Only suggestion would be to make extra because you can't keep fingers out of the bowl :)

This was a good base recipe, my cake was dry, and I also had issues with the icing. I found a cream cheese icing, and that brought the cake to life. Work with it, and it gets better as you add to it!

Followed the recipe with the oil, sugar & cocoa modifications.  Taste overall was ok, just different than I expected. Milk & flour mixture must be boiled down to almost a pudding-like consistancy in order to work.  Cool completely as the recipe says. Be patient mixing in the granulated sugar.  It will work.

I have no idea what went wrong with this cake.  I am usually a really good baker but this did not turn out at all.  I took others suggestions and did an extra 1/2 cup of sugar, extra tbs cocoa powder and used the cup of oil instead of the shortening.  The cake would not cook all the way in the middle so i had to cook it for longer than 30 minutes and it ended up really dry and almost the consistency of cake like brownies.  I am however giving 2 stars because it did have a good taste.  I didnt even frost it though and threw it away.  I will not try this recipe again.

I used this recipe following a few of the modifications suggested by others, which usually always works for me.  However, I am not exactly sure what went wrong here.  If I ever make another red velvet cake I don't think I will use this recipe again.

I made this as cup cakes following all the changes recommended by other users and they turned out really good.. very light and well flavoured. My frosting however wasnt good.. the flour kind of lumped up and I didnt know to smoothen it.. Also I read that you had to really beat the frosting to death but after a while it started getting grainy and not smooth..

Followed the mods made by other reviewers, and the cake was still pretty dry! Used a cream cheese frosting and YUCK. First time ive ever tried cream frosting and it will be my last! But i tried it the next day after it had chilled in the fridge and it was a bit better. Still, it wasnt my cup of tea..

First off, WHOAH, we had more than enough food coloring!  My fingernails are still a little red...  That aside, I really liked this recipe.  The paste part was a little difficult, but it was otherwise pretty simple.  The frosting was to DIE for (and even though I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, I STILL felt bad!).  Everyone else has said it's very good too, and though I'm not a big chocolate fan, I gotta agree.    Dunno if it was just me or not, but my cake fell apart a little bit, which was sad.  I added some sliced strawberry inbetween layers and on top.    Overall pretty  tasty, I gotta say.

I am an experienced baker, but this did not work out for me.  I used the recommended alterations, but it stuck to the pan, and fell.  Also the cooking time was more like 55 minutes.  I do have a thermometer set up in the oven, so I know I had the temp right, and I also had a high quality pan, and had it greased well.  The part in the middle tasted pretty good, though, but you can't just serve it like that!

This cake lacks flavor. I substituted shortening for 1 cup of oil, increased sugar to 2 cups, and increased cocoa to 5T. It turned out perfectly but the cake is bland.

I don't know why so many people can't work with this frosting, I think it's excellent. Maybe they're not thickening it long enough before removing it from the heat? It's a tasty frosting and compliments the cake nicely.

Will use the frosting again but undecided about the cake.

With all the suggested adjustments (oil, sugar, etc) it worked pretty well, though not as fluffy as what I was hoping for. Just a bit dense for my liking. The icing is totally new for me. Interesting, but I think I'll use cream cheese frosting after this (even if it's not traditional!!)

This is very similar to a cake I grew up with.  My Mother had a newspaper article that called the cake "$500 Waldorf Astoria cake".  The only change I make is to cut each layer into two and then to add coconut to each layer on top of the frosting, the top layer I add a little more coconut. I do not frost the sides of the cake.  It looks like a 4 layer cake when you are finished.

I made these last night (they are time consuming!).  I made all the changes that were suggested and the cupcakes turned out amazing (22 minutes at 350) but the icing was a complete mess.  It was watery and sugary.  I spent over an hour trying to get a good consistency but they are still sitting on my counter without frosting.  I'm going to buy some after work, I suggest that everyone else trying to make this recipe do the same.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because the frosting part of the recipe wasn't very good.  The cake however was exceptional!  And I found it made great cupcakes if you decrease the baking time to 20-25 min at 350.

I made two dozen red velvet cupcakes with this recipe, and they turned out moist and delicious.  After reading the reviews, I substituted one cup of oil for the half cup of shortening and added an extra half cup of sugar as well as an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder.  I baked the cupcakes for about 23 minutes at 350 degrees F.  I used a separate recipe for cream cheese frosting, which worked perfectly with the cupcakes from this recipe.  Thank you to those who wrote such helpful reviews.  This was my first successful cupcake experience!

It came out a bit drier than I was hoping, but with a few minor modifications, this cake can be top notch.  Aside from being dry, it tasted great.

Followed the suggestions for replacing shortening with oil, and we added close to a 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, but my friends and I thought that the cake was still quite bland, even though the texture was excellent.  I would most likely not make this again, as the taste is just quite lacking.

I also replaced the icing with a cream cheese icing(upon request), which happened to be everyones favourite thing about the recipe.

This recipe was "okay"...I usually have really good luck with 4 star recipes but I guess not this one.  I think it needs more flavor and I probably should have put more cocoa powder.  The icing was a disaster. I think I'll keep trying to find a red velvet to my recipe to my tasting.

THe cake was not bad, the icing however was horrible. The icing is much to buttery for the already rich cake, and its appearence was far from beautiful. I strongly recommend trading this icing for a simple, delicious, and more attractive cream cheese icing.
This is one I strongly recommend:

One 8 ounce package of cream cheese, softened
1/4 c. butter, softened
2 tsp. vanilla
1 lb. pkg. powdered sugar

Beat together cream cheese, butter, and vanilla until creamy. Add the sugar a little bit at a time smooth.

I made this with the suggested substitutions and it turned out great.  The frosting is what really makes this - I used the suggested frosting once and cream cheese frosting the second time and the suggested frosting was a much better match for the recipe.

My daughter requested a red velvet cake for her birthday.  She didn't want cream cheese frosting, so I'm glad I found this recipe. This was my first red velvet cake, and I was very pleased with the results.  There were no leftovers!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted 1 cup of oil for the shortening, increased the sugat to a total of two cups, and used a total of 5 Tbsp. cocoa powder.  I also used a 1 oz jar of Wilton no-taste red coloring paste in place of the 2 oz of red food coloring.  I baked the cake for the time specified in the recipe.  The edges seemed a bit crisp, but the cake softened up nicely after it was frosted.  I doubled the frosting because I always seem to run out, but I had a lot left over.  I was glad I had extra, though, because I had to fill in the middle of the bottom layer, which fell after I turned it out of the pan.  I'm not sure why that happened, but it was all okay in the long run.  I gave this recipe four stars because I made so many modifications.  With the changes, this will be my "go to" recipe for red velvet cake.  Thanks!

following other's leads, I used the 1 cup of oil instead of shortening, 2 cups of sugar, and used 5 tbsp of cocoa powder. This is the first cake I've made, and it turned out really good. This was a trial run for a cake I'm making in a few weeks, and since I didn't have food colouring I didn't put it in, but for the real one I will. I also made my own buttermilk by using one cup of milk and 1 tbsp of vinegar and letting it sit for about 5 minutes. It took 35min to  bake, and the edges were a bit crispy but I cut those off and ate them myself haha. I made buttercream frosting, but next time I make it I'll be using cream cheese frosting, I was too lazy to go out and buy the cream cheese this time. I don't have much experience with red velvet cakes so I can't say how it compares, but I like it!

I made this recipe with the few changes that others recommended.  Such as 1 cup oil and 2 cups sugar and I doubled the amount of cocoa the recipe called for.  This cake came out moist with a nice red color.  I made a cream cheese frosting that really complimented the cake.  I will keep this recipe and make this cake again!

Loved the cake, but wasn't too fond of the icing from this recipe.
