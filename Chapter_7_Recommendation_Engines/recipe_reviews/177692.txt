I adjusted this recipe to use stew meat and to be able to be cooked in the crockpot. I browned the meat (I did season the meat with a little garlic/onion powder, basil, oregano and some fresh ground pepper) as the recipe stated and layered it in the crockpot. Then I browned the onion and garlic (I used half of one large onion, as that's what I had to use on hand) with a little butter in the hot pan, then added the beef broth and scraped up all the good bits up off the pan before adding it to the crockpot. Couple hours on high and we were ready to roll. I sauteed the mushrooms in a little EVOO/butter just slightly and stirred it into the stroganoff ingredients with the sour cream, a little worchestershire sauce and a little more basil, oregano and fresh ground pepper. Over buttered egg noodles, this was a very filling dinner never mind budget friendly, using both a cheap cut of meat and using a crockpot. More than enough for all of us to eat our fill......even the littlest who "mmmmmmm"'d his way through dinner.

My family LOVED this!  I didn't put any mushrooms in though, my daughter is not a fan of them.  I thought the beef flavor was a bit strong, but the family didn't think so.  Thumbs up from all 4 kids, under 6 years old!

This was super simple and lacked nothing in taste. I left out the mushrooms because I've never been a big fan of them. The juices from the meat cook right in to the noodles, giving them a nice beefy flavor. This tasted just like my grandmothers. I will be making this again and again!

Good recipe and very easy to make. I used hamburger meat instead of sirloin strips because it was what I had on hand. I also seasoned the meat with garlic and onion powder salt and pepper. It still came out great even my toddlers like it.

This dish has very little favor. Maybe it can use some tuning of some spices, black pepper and salt.

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was quite good, but a little bit bland.  I didn't have any beef broth, so I made bouillon, which might have had something to do with it.  I also had to add another 1/2 cup of bouillon, as my noodles just wouldn't get done.  Again, that might have been my error as my lid doesn't fit tightly on my skillet.  The only other thing I did differently was to deglaze the pan with about 1/4 cup of red wine before adding the broth.  I think next time I'll use a different skillet with a tighter lid and I'll use 2 cups of broth from the beginning.  I will also add a bit of Worcestershire as I feel it needs the zip.

Wow this was good and not to mention easy. I followed the recipe except using the mushrooms and I used beef tips. Loved the flavor of the noodles from the sauce.

Very good and easy. I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef, because that is what I had ready to use. I added some Worchester sauce and some Lowry's seasonings. I am sorry to say that I did not have any mushrooms on hand so had to do it without. I didn't have the canned soup but used Watkins soup base and I am sure it was just as good. Got compliments and requests for the recipe at church.

Excellent dish. My 5 year old isn't big on mushrooms and onions so the only change I made was I put only half of what it called for. He made a happy plate and didn't even notice. There were no leftovers:)

Good recipe, easy to make.  I added some salt and pepper while cooking it.  Other than that, it didn't need anything else.

I never used to enjoy beef stroganoff but after getting a pre-boxed "kit" from the store, I really enjoyed it and decided to give it a try, homemade. I wanted to be able to control the fat/calories, plus neither me or my husband likes cream of mushroom soup, so the quest was on. I really like this recipe and it is so easy! My husband is also a bit picky and hates sour cream but he enjoys this meal a lot. I use ground beef instead but other than that, I basically stick to the recipe. We make this bi-weekly. Thanks!
