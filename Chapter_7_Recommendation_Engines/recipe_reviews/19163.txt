This had a lovely red color, and tasted great!  I found it definitely takes pre-planning, though, you'll need at least an hour for the punch to cool enough to pour into containers and then into the freezer.  I've found one batch fits perfectly into 2 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bags.  Just one night's freezing left it at the perfect slushy consistency, more than that and you have a solid, unpourable block o' frozen liquid.  I suspect if we take the second bag out and put it in the fridge overnight, it should again be the perfect consistency.

I followed some of the reviews and used only 1 cup sugar.  I'm glad I did, it was perfect!  2 1/2 would have been WAY too sweet.  1 cup was sweet and just a little tart.  I froze each half in gallon ziplock bags.  I pulled out one bag 2 hours before the party, and the next about 30 mins before the party so it would start defrosting while the first was being drank, and be ready to go by the time it was empty.  Everybody loved it and it was a beautiful pink color. UPDATE:  I've taken this to 4 parties now and it's always commented on.  YUM.

I make this with Splenda, sugar-free jello and Diet Squirt.  It's perfect for those who can't have sugar and those of us who are watching our carbs and calories.  When I do make it with sugar, I only use 1- 1 1/2 cups, or it's too sweet for our taste.  It's become an instant family favorite and gets requested by my kids for their birthdays even.  This is a great punch, just allow extra time for freezing.  I follow the suggestion of dividing the punch into 2- 1 gallon freezer Ziploc bags that I place on a sheetcake pan in my freezer until frozen.  I have never had to wait for the punch to cool before pouring it, by doing it this way.  I take 1 bag of punch out of the freezer an hour or so before serving and with it in my punch bowl, I scrape it with a metal spatula to make a consistent slush when the 2 liter is added.  I've also sat it in my sink for an hour and let it thaw a bit on its own and/or microwaved it for a minute or so to get it to the consistency I wanted.  If you forget to get it out beforehand or have unexpected company, just throw it in the microwave and it'll be ready in no time.  This is very good with Gingerale as well.  Feel free to change up the jello flavors, I tried Wild Strawberry and Cherry combined for an extra treat.  I have made this for over 5 years now (updated 7/18/08) and everyone loves and requests it for all holidays and my Christmas cookie exchange. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!  :)

I made this punch for my daughter's wedding and it was fabulous!  I made it a couple of weeks before the wedding and froze it in freezer bags as another reviewer had suggested, & layed the bags on their sides on a cookie sheet to freeze so the frozen liquid would not be very thick.  Mixing it was a breeze.  We placed a bag of the frozen punch in a roaster pan, gradually added the lemon lime soda and used a potato masher to mix it into a slushy icy mixture. We then poured it into the punch bowl to serve.  Everyone loved it and many many compliments were received.  I will definately make this punch again.  It is so easy to make and so convenient to make it ahead of time and have it frozen and ready to go at any given moment....just add lemon lime soda and you have instant punch!  I froze half of one of the batches I made in ice cube trays in case I needed to add it to the punch when it began to melt & get warm but it never had the chance to loose it's slush!  I had some of the cubes left and they have been great to use to mix up a cup or two of punch at a time.  Adding a shot of Vodka to a cup of punch is also pretty tasty!  
You can't go wrong with this punch!
Thanks Valerie for sharing it!!

Only used 1 cup of sugar which was perfect.  Can't even begin to imagine how sweet this would be if you used 2 1/2 cups.  Didn't have strawberry gelatin, so I subbed using the tropical fusion gelatin mix of cherry, pineapple and orange.  Added watermelon vodka shots to each glass of punch served and WOW was it ever fabulous!

I submitted this recipe and it makes me smile to see so many people enjoying it.  Thank you for your kind words.  However, I have noticed that many of you have problems getting your "slush" right. I have one word for you, "MICROWAVE."  Recently I went to my great niece's 2nd birthday and her Mom was panicked because there was no "slush" in her punch.  I placed it in the microwave for a few minutes, then took a knife and broke it up until I knew that when the 7-UP hit, it would be perfectly slushy.  Once again, there wasn't a drop left.  The plastic containers make this easy to make ahead and then place in the microwave, however I haven't used the freezer bags as many of you have suggested and that seems to be a useful hint.  I hope you continue to enjoy and be sure to share!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! In all honesty, I have been searching for the 'perfect' punch to make 'Jungle Juice' with. This is definitely it! I made the recipe mostly as specified, except I cut the sugar (like others suggested) down to a little over a cup. Trust me, you WON'T miss the extra sugar. I also used one strawberry jell-o packet and one cherry jell-o packet and used 1 litre of lemon-lime soda and one liter of ginger ale. I added a liter and a half of Cruzan brand Mango flavored rum and WOW! That is all I can say. It was soooo good! Everyone at the party wanted to drink it! This is definitely worth the time. The rum was masked by the punch but it still did it's job ;] I can't wait to make this again! Hopefully this helps others with figuring out how much alcohol can be added.

I made this punch today for a tenure reception party I was catering and everyone LOVED it!!  I have made a less exspensive Kool Aid version before, but this is so much better and worth the extra money and prep time.  I made a double batch and froze it in 4 Ziploc bags for two days.  I took it out of the freezer about 2 1/2 hours before the party and mashed each bag seperately before adding to the punch bowl.  I used ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda, too, and the taste was wonderful!  This will be my basic punch for catering orders from now on!

This is a great recipe to tweak.  I reduce the sugar to 1 cup (we don't care for sugary sweet punch), and use ginger ale instead of Sprite or 7Up.  I've also used different colors of gelatin to coordinate with baby shower (I've used blue gelatin for green punch-when the baby's gender is a surprise).  Very good for parties!

Yum! I've never had disappointed guests after serving this punch; it's always a hit. I recommend using just 1 cup sugar though. It gets pretty sweet once all of the ingredients are combined.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made a few times! It always goes without any leftover no matter how many people I serve it to! Make sure you remove it from the freezer a couple of hours prior to serving or it will be to hard. Otherwise, it is wonderufl because it can be made ahead of time...days or weeks and stored in the freezer until the day you need it! Great for large groups, BBQ's, holidays, etc!! Highly Recommend......

I made this recipe using 1 cup sugar, very good!  Here's the utensils that made it easy:
6 quart pot
large 1 quart measuring cup
64 ounce pitcher
2 zip lock gallon bags
I lined the pitcher with the zip lock bag and used the measuring cup to fill the bag with punch.  I had a wet washcloth underneath to catch those drips that stain the counter.  I then sealed the bag and slid it out into the freezer.  Repeat with 2nd bag.  No sticky spills!

I made this for girls night and it was a big hit.  I spiked it and added 2c vodka and 1 1/2 c triple sec to the mix before I froze it.  With booze in it, it does make a nice slushy mix which is easy to scoop out and mix with 7-up.  I only used 1 and 1/2 cup sugar, as noted by others.  Was asked for the recipe 3 times.  Will make again for sure.

I honestly didn't have high expectations when I decided to try this recipe.  Afterall, it's just a punch, right?  I was thinking what's all the hoopla and five stars rating for something as simple as a punch... Well, I was wrong.  This punch is fabulous. I'd give it ten stars if I could. It was the hit of the party for both kids and adults.  EVERY PERSON who tried this punch said it was awesome.  There were no negative or even mediocre comments.   We whizzed through a full batch in a couple of hours and everyone was asking for more.  For the next party I'll double the recipe.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and it was just right.  I also used sugar-free jello and diet Sprite.  The results were fantastic.  I also followed the advice of others and froze the mixture in two one gallon ziploc bags.  I think I'll make another batch soon and freeze it in quart size bags so the kids can enjoy an occasional treat.  With a recipe this good, it's a shame to save it for special occasions only.  Give this recipe a try; you won't be disappointed!

I gave this 5 stars based on the idea - it's a great way to keep the punch cold without diluting it with ice. I was looking for a blue punch to make for my sister's baby shower in a few weeks. I tried this recipe, (cut down) but wanted to simplify it a bit, since we'll have 65 guests. I used Berry Blue Jello and cut the sugar in half. In order to keep the blue color, I used Limeade in place of the orange juice and lemon juice. I mixed it with Sprite. I tastes like a lollipop in a glass to me. :) I think it will be a hit at the baby shower.

The punch seemed sweet to me, but everyone loved it. I would probably cut down the sugar next time, as others have suggested. I used raspberry and cherry gelatin.  I used generic lemon-lime and ginger ale as the beverages.  Served it for Easter dinner. Children drank it straight and adults dashed in vodka to their taste.  Also, I kept adding orange juice, lemon juice, and carbonated beverages as the punch bowl emptied. Still fabulously tasty and had to do that because it was wildly popular and I just about ran out. This is a keeper! Later edit:  I have made this about a dozen times now.  The ziploc bags were beginning to be a bother for me, so bought the grocery store's huge generic tub of ice cream.  Once we ate the ice cream, I have made that the designated slush punch container.  Make the punch and put it in the freezer, no mess!

This is very good, people did ask for the recipe.
After taking out of the freezer, flake it out with a fork first before adding the lemon-lime soda so you don't get large blobs.  It's much harder to mix if it becomes large slippery blobs at the bottom of your bowl.  It's also more work.  Also, make sure you cool the lime soda first before adding or it will dissolve all the ice and won't come out slushy and also throw in a few floating icecubes to keep it cool.  The pineapple is found in the frozen section of the grocery store, mine was 48 fld oz. not 46.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is a good one to try.  I'll use it again.  Kids and adults love it.

I served this at a baby shower...everyone loved it.
I froze the 'slush' in the freezer the day before and then put it in the fridge right before going to bed.  I froze in 2 large bowls.  When I ran out of first bowl I microwaved the second frozen bowl and it turned out perfectly.

This went over very well at my kids baptism today.  I did the recipe as written and there wasn't a drop left.   I used the tip of freezing overnight in 2 Ziploc bags, and laying flat on a cookie sheet to freeze.  It was perfect the next day, not frozen solid and turned perfectly slushy when I poured in the pop.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks!  UPDATE: I made this again but used cherry jello.  Was still good but my family prefers the strawberry. The punch gets sweeter as the slush melts, which the kids like but adults don't - going to reduce the sugar to 2 cups next time.

This is by far the best punch I have ever tasted. I served it recently at a graduation party and this punch was the hit! I took some other reviewers advice and it came out absolutely perfect! Here's my version: I used 2 packages of raspberry gelatin and only 1 cup of sugar as other readers suggested. I boiled it with the water and immediately added the orange, pineapple and lemon juice. I let this cool for about 1/2 hour and then poured the mixture into 2 1-gallon zip lock bags. I double bagged them and let them cool to room temp. I froze them over night. The next day, they were not completely frozen, but I took them out exactly 2 hours before the party and let them thaw. As soon as the party started I added one 2-liter bottle of ginger ale to 1 bag of juice and the mixture was perfect! Slushy juice that stayed cold the entire time!! And the taste was amazing!! This will be my go to punch from now on! Heather

Absolutely wonderful!I did decrease the sugar to 11/2 cups and replaced 3 cups of the water with 3 cups vodka. It freezes to a perfect slush. In the summer time for our garage parties I use a 2 gallon insulated drink dispenser without the lid for a punch bowl. It helps keep it slushly in warm weather. We also prefer sugar free ginger ale instead of the lemone-lime soda. All of my friends request this punch w/punch! : )

I have been using this punch recipe for about 3 years now for baby showers, birthday parties, etc.  It is the best punch recipe I have come across!!  Everyone loves it and several people have asked me for the recipe.  It is delicious!!  I usually prep the punch the night before the party and divide it into two gallon ziplock freezer bags(double-bag it just in case it leaks) and freeze it.  It will take hours to freeze.  Let one bag sit out at room temperature an hour or so before the party so it has time to get a little slushy so it breaks up easily when the bottle of soda is poured over it.  If you don't need the second ziplock bag of punch mix it, you will already have it ready for the next party.

My cousins loved this (kids), but I found it too sweet. Next time, I will probably use sugar-free jello and cut the amount of sugar called for in half.

GREAT!  Served this last weekend (it was very hot outside) and it was a huge hit!  I did cut back on the sugar - 1.5 cups is plenty!  I also found that one frozen mixture is plenty for 2 2-liters of soda, so you can use 4 total 2-liters of soda with the frozen mixture.  Everyone loved this - will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was a DELICIOUS punch!  I made it for my daughter's 25th birthday and it was a huge hit!  No body wanted to drink anything else!  I made one change and that was only to the sugar.  I added one cup of sugar but next time I'll even reduce it to 1/2 cup.  I also used a 2L bottle of Sprite for the lemon-lime beverage.  I used the entire recipe incredients (minus less sugar) and divided in 2 extra large Ziploc bags overnight. About an hour before the guests arrived I simply let them thaw in the punch bowl.  I was able to break pieces off as the gelatin makes is easy to break apart. Garnished with sliced lemons and sliced strawberries for the bowl. For those adding alcohol -- coconut rum or raspberry vodka were big hits!  These go down fast so make the entire amount.  I also had some left over so I simply refroze what we didn't use.  Excellent recipe!

This punch recipe is a definite winner!  I made this for my daughters' birthday party this weekend and every last drop of punch was gone!  I followed the advice of many other reviewers and added less sugar - I went with 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect.  I poured the cooled mixture into two 1-gallon ziptop bags and froze them (this recipe makes 18 cups total so I poured 9 cups into each bag).  The night before the party, I took one bag out to thaw in the refrigerator and the morning of the party, I took the 2nd bag out to thaw.  The reviewer who gave the tip of using a potato masher to mix up the slush is a genius, worked like a charm!  My only regret with this recipe is that I didn't double it, because now I'm out of punch!
(And I'm pretty sure this would also be fantastic if you added some rum to it before freezing, and then after it's "slushy" just scoop some into a glass and top with lemon-lime soda...YUM!)

This is a very delicious punch!!  I have made it for birthday parties, wedding showers, etc. and have gotten so many compliments.  I only add about 1 cup (or less) of sugar since it's already plenty sweet with the jello, juices, and soda.  I divide it in half and freeze it in ziploc bags.  You need to take it out quite awhile before you want to serve it or you will be trying to chop up a solid block of ice.  At least a couple hours before you want to serve it or longer.  I've had to microwave it before so it would thaw enough to chop into slush.  I like to serve it with ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda.  So good!!  My go-to punch recipe!!

This is a very good punch recipe. I used ginger ale instead of 7-up and only one cup of sugar (which was plenty). Great punch for a party, but DO take the frozen mixture out of the freezer at least two hours before the party.

Definitely a make ahead recipe that takes some planning but wonderful once you have it served.  I found the measurements a bit confusing being Canadian and I had to do some conversions.  46 Fl oz of pineapple juice was 5.5 cups and 1 quart of orange juice was 4 cups.

Used 2 cups of sugar and it was almost too sweet.  I would suggest 1.5 cups.  Had a baby shower with 40 people and the punch needed 3 2 litters to serve everyone.  Kept the same amount of slush and just used more lemon/line.

I made this for my daughter's 21st birthday (no alcohol served).  It was very refreshing and tasty.  I cut the sugar back by 1 C and found 1 1/2 cup was perfect, using lemon-lime soda as the indicated, not ginger ale.  Only suggestions other than cutting back on the sugar are to take the frozen punch out at least 1 hour in advance and don't use refrigerated soda as it keeps the punch from melting.  We had large clumps rather than slush for an hour.  Other than that, it was very tasty.

Very delicious.  Definitely cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I used ginger ale and halved the recipe since I had 20 guests.  The punch was perfectly slushy if you take the bag out of the freezer and put on the COUNTER 2-3 hours before....make sure you do not thaw in the fridge or you will need much longer than 2-3 hours.  

Garnishing Tip:  Cherries, Strawberries and Orange Slices

be sure to mix at least 1 hour before serving otherwise it won't melt in time.

This is AMAZING! I added two cups of Bacardi Dragon Berry to the mix before I freezed it. I also put the punch into ziploc bags. It made it very easy to take out the frozen baggies and add it when I needed to add more to the punch bowl..the next day when I took ziploc bags out of the freezer..I added three more cups of regular Bacardi to the punch

Just sampled this in preparation for our Christmas party! Awesome! Wasn't sure if it would really be as good as people said (after all it's just punch), but it really is! Very refreshing and waaaaay better than the sherbet punch. Made it with 1 cup sugar, strawberry jello, and ginger ale. Added a bit of cocunut Malibu rum for the adults and wow! Delicious! So glad I tried this! Can't wait to see how my guests like it! Also want to try different flavored rum or vodka as the coconut rum really enhanced the flavor!
Update: Everyone at my party kept commenting on how delicious this punch was and quickly drained the bowl. I will definitely use this as my go to punch recipe. I had one bag of frozen mix leftover (I had made a double batch) and we have been enjoying it by single glass whenever we want a refreshing drink. Definitely recommend trying it with Coconut Malibu Rum. Also trid flavored ginger ale and sprite and my favorite by far was the plain ginger ale.

Fantastic recipe.First bowl went quick, heard people commenting on how good it was.Tried it myself and it was so yummy but then someone said try it with blueberry vodka. They were right it sends it over the top.Ended up running out of vodka cause everyone was adding it. Made a double batch and was glad I did. I used raspberry jello and cut the sugar to 1 cup, which was a good choice because people commented on how they liked it cause it wasn't too sweet. Used ginger ale. Made the night before and was perfect consistency. Laid the four bags into 2 roasting pan and placed in the deep freezer to stop them from sliding, to keep them flat and because I was afraid they might leak. Also someone said they had trouble filling the bags by themselves. What I did was gently folded down the top of the bag to hold it opened then placed the bag into a medium sized pot that could just hold the 8 cups or so of slush mix and it worked perfectly to hold up the bag until I filled it. Thanks for a great recipe. Will be making this again.

This is the best punch I've had - and both kids and adults like it as well. I froze the jello/juice mixture in a gallon freezer bag. It took about 20 minutes to become slushy after mixing it with the soda.

I made this punch for a Boy Scout Eagle Court and it was a big hit.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar, but not much.  I used 2 cups instead of the 2 1/2 cups the recipe calls for.  I used the gallon zip-lock bags and took a roasting pan and a potato masher with me...I emptied each bag one at a time
into the pan, mashed it up with the potato masher, added the lemon lime drink, mashed it in well, and then put in in the punch bowl.  The slushiness was perfect!  I used wild strawberry jello...One tip: if you want really red punch, you will need to add some red food coloring.

I was looking for a good fruity/slushy punch that I could spike with booze and this one fit the bill. Here's a couple things I did differently: cut back on the sugar like everyone else and used 1.5 cups, 6 cups water, 1 strawberry Jello mix, 1 orange Jello mix then added 23oz pineapple juice (instead of 46oz), 2/3 lemon juice, 1/2 quart V8 Fusion pineapple-strawberry juice.

To make up for the decreased fluid, I made up for it by adding 1 bottle Svedka Mango-Pineapple Vodka, half a bottle Captain Morgan's Lime Bite Spiced Rum. After I mixed all of that together, I divided it into 2 Ziploc bags as shown.

I also cut up chunks of strawberry, orange, lemon, lime and placed in a seperate Ziploc bag and froze along with the slush. I didn't combine it because the fruit would actually become too mushy that way. If you add the fruit to the slush after you mix in the 7UP and the fruit stays intact. I think the fruit really adds a touch of color and class to the punch.

Needless to say, my guests completely LOST THEIR MINDS over this punch, drank it all and no joke, my husband was slurping up the bottom of the punch bowl by the end of the night.

Love Love Loved It! Had a little problem with making it actually slush but that was probably just my doing. Next time I'm going to add sherbet ice cream (because I think that would just be awesome in this!) I myself like the sweetness because I am southern and I love love very sweet tea but if you are not a very sweet person (no pun intended) you may want to cut it a little.

I made 8 bowls of this for my daughters wedding last weekend.  We ran out of punch in 2 hours, everyone kept asking who made the punch, I will definately continue using this recipe for years to come and pass it along.

Made for son's graduation party with following changes: no added sugar, couldn't find pineapple juice so I used 5 cups of Welsh's pineapple/apple/orange juice mix. Used other ingredients as directed. When I got ready to pour the Mountain Dew into the punch bowl, my son begged me not to ruin his favorite drink! I said 'trust me' and the rest is history! He loved it! I'm thinking of a way to make individual servings for the summer. Maybe pour mixture into ice cube trays and then add mountain dew and blend. Also thinking this would make great freezer pops.

Fantastic! I first made this for our Halloween party. I did not freeze a portion. I just put it in the fridge until I was ready to serve. I made a double batch and added 750mL of rum and 750 mL of vodka. It was perfect and gone in no-time. I also made this for my daughter's 13th birthday, minus the alcohol and the kids LOVED it. It's so good i've thought about making some just to keep at home.

Great to the last drop!  The calories in this must be astronomical when made as-is (as i did) but it's pretty much a holidays-only thing for me.  I would be careful if you plan to feeze more than just 24 hours, it's slushy at that point, but any longer it's hard as a rock (at least in my freezer).

I've made this several times now and it's wonderful! I cut the sugar in half and stick to the receipe as is. Just serve with a good vodka on the side.

This was awesome!!  I made it for a baby shower and it was a huge hit!!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and it was yummy.  I filled the punch in 2 gallon-size Ziploc-style bags and put it in the freezer the night before my lunch party.  I took it out 2 hourse before the party was to start and it worked out perfectly.  One bag plus the soda made exactly the amount of the bowl.  I floated orange slices on top.  It was so pretty and best of all...delicious!

I am always looking for the best recipe of anything I make, thats why I use this site :) This is one of the best punch recipes I have ever used. I did love the suggestion of using freezer bags to freeze it, makes it so easy to transport it.  I think I will stop looking now for the best punch recipe.

I use this in my high school foods classes and the kids love it.  It has also been a big hit at all of my children's graduation parties.  It is so helpful that it is made ahead of time. Let it sit out a half hour or more before mixing.  Use ginger ale for more flavor.
Freeze in one gallon ziplock bags to cut down on party night dishes.

I followed the suggestion of others to reduce the sugar, to just 1 cup and we all loved it!! I wish I would have taken a pic, We have one of those 3 gallon dispensers, that you put ice in a separate core so it doesn't dilute the punch, and another piece that I put frozen strawberries in to give it extra boost of flavor.  
So I didn't have to freeze any of it.  I just put half of the mixture in with a bottle of diet 7 up, and left the rest in the fridge until I needed it.  I used diet 7up because, i thought regular 7up would be so much more sugar and too sweet.  My friends agree. 
It worked GREAT since we had a quick 2 hour party and we didn't have to wait for it to thaw in a punch bowl.  
There were about 30 of us, and everyone went back for seconds & thirds.  
All wanted to know how to make it and said I should be sure to write a review and say they all loved it and agree it is a 5 star punch!

A very drinkable punch. Made it for the first time with only 1 cup sugar to 6 cups water, and it was just right for a party of 25 older adults. Even the men were drinking it... virgin! I might sweeten it a bit more for younger palates.

I made this punch with lemon jello and less sugar (1 1/2 -2 cups) for a bridal shower. Long story short, they served it the wedding, and the next bride liked it so well that it was served at her wedding! Freeze half a recipe flat in a zip lock bag. slightly thaw the bags before adding the soda. We used 4 punch bowls and rotated full bowls in and empty ones out. We served over 200 people on a hot day with 6 recipes. I floated lemon slices on top.

Getting the consistency right with this can be a little tricky, especially if it freezes too long.  I use freezer bags for containers and lay them out flat  for a somewhat thin shape to make it easier to thaw and break up.  Just make sure to protect your freezer for leaks.  I move one bag to the fridge early in the morning and the second bag to the fridge right before the party to give some time to start thawing.  The flavor is fantastic so I give it 5 stars, but it can be tricky to serve.

I can't imagine how to make this recipe any better. I did decrease the sugar to 1 cup, but I don't like the really sweet beverages. I would probably just omit the sugar next time for my preference. I did find the mix fit nicely into two gallon ziptop bags, after about 22 hours it had not frozen solid but was nice and slushy. Thanks so much for sharing.

Wonderful punch!  I have made it twice, both time with rave reviews from my guests!  Once with ginger ale and the other with lemon/lime soda - both are very good!  It is a refreshing hit with adults and kiddos alike!

I keep this made in my freezer all the time. I have a 64 oz bucket from another drink mix and I mix 6 ounces everclear with it. The non alcoholic version has become my kids favorite. They get so excited when they see me mixing it up!!! Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good. I only rated 4 stars because there is WAY too much sugar in this recipe. Because of other reviews, I cut back on sugar, and next time I will cut back even more. However, the punch was very good and people loved it!

Not Bad at all! I did get comments on it too. As long as you poor chilled soda into it, there should be no reason for it to melt too quick, actually, it stayed slushy all the way through! I toned down the sugar to one cup, but I think I would have prefered the full amount as specified in the recipe.I prepared the frozen bags in the deep freezer that morning, and by that evening, they were perfect.This one is my new staple.

My kids loved this. I halved the recipe. Used an ice cream scooper and scooped it in their cups then added the Sprite to each glass.

I found by making this early in the morning & not allowing it to freeze all the way through worked best for us. I have been making this for 2 years, and both years our family gathering of 18, ages 6 to 98, have drained my punch bowl saying "Wow this is good". Next year I will be sure I have more in my freezer.

I've been making this for a couple of years.  It's easy, you can use whatever flavor jello you like, and everyone LOVES the stuff.  Super easy in the gallon freezer bags and made a day or three ahead of time.

Made this for my daughters 13th birthday~! We LOVED this punch.  I have more in the freezer now for our Christmas Eve family get together.  I did add 2 bottles of Diet Sprite instead of one so the punch was easier to drink.  Please give this a try, you will love it. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Wow, this was delicious! I made it for a baby shower I hosted in my home. I only intended to use half (one ziplock bag) for the party but it disappeared too quickly and folks kept asking for more, so I had to give up the other half back in the freezer. I threw that in the microwave for 2 minutes, then used a spoon to break it up some more before pouring the ginger ale over it. (Well, for the first mix, I used Ginger ale, for the second, Sprite. No one commented on the change but I prefer the Ginger ale mix) All of it went so quickly and so many people asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was using only 1 cup of sugar (as other reviewers suggested). I'll definitely make this again! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

I read many of the suggestions and decided to try 2 cups of sugar instead of the 2.5...it was fantastic!  I doubt the extra half cup would have made it too sweet.  I made it for a baby shower and the girls couldn't get enough of it!  I'll definitely make this one again and again.

Great punch.  I am always asked for the recipes.  I also only use 1 1/2 C sugar.  Freeze and it takes about 2 hours to become slushy.  With alcohol, only 1/2 hour.

I loved this punch!  I halfed it to try it before serving to a group and now I am hooked.  It is the perfect blend of ingredients.  I used Dole's Orange/Mango/Pineapple juice instead of lemon juce and it had just the perfect taste!

This recipe is awesome! Very easy to make. I've made it many times and its great for summer refreshment. I usually make a lot at one time and then store it in gallon sized freezer bags in the freezer.

I made this punch for my Daughter's Spanish Fiesta at school.  The children loved it so much that they bypassed soft drinks for the punch! The adults loved it as well! My only substitutions were 2 cups sugar instead of 2 1/2 and I used pineapple-orange juice in place of the pineapple and orange juice.  I used 2 large cans and this worked out really well.  The Teacher (from Mexico) said it tasted like authentic Mexican fruit punch. Great recipe!! Just remember to make base the night before or it won't freeze sufficiently.

I have my cooking classes make this whenever we have a reception, open house, etc., and everyone loves it. I do like the recipe made with strawberry jello but I had the students make this for a fall reception and we substituted 1 orange jello and 1 apricot jello for the 2 strawberry jellos but the other ingredients were unchanged. It was great! Several people said they liked it better than the strawberry.  It would go very nicely with a  Thanksgiving table presentation. I Wish I could give you more than five stars!!!

PERFECT!!  I only needed to use one frozen bag of mix & three 2-liters of soda for my party of 30.  It took a while to thaw...so I would recommend pouring in the soda about thirty minutes before the party starts.  I got lots of requests for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is absolutely FABULOUS punch!  I made it with a large box of strawberry Jello instead of 2 small ones and used 7-Up.  We made it the day before and took it out about 10 minutes before the guests arrived and had no problems with it becoming slushy quickly. There really, truly was not a drop of it left by the time my birthday party was finished - adults and kids alike LOVED it.  Two women demanded to have the recipe before leaving for home!!!  Highly recommended - no doubt about it!

Great recipe! Everyone enjoyed this drink at my baby shower. They asked for the recipe. Only a cup was left at the end. It made plenty of juice for a party of 20 people. I will continue to forward this recipe to others. :-)

My personal favorite punch recipe, but I may substitute this for Easy Punch, depending on the time I have and what the event is. When I want to WOW, then I use Luscious Slush Punch, but both recipes are frequently requested.

Great slush texture that doesn't melt away too fast, nice sweetness and tang. DEFINITELY cut back on the sugar by at least half, or even more.

Still TOO SWEET when I made it with just 1 cup of added sugar.  Just made it again for New Year's Day WITHOUT ANY added sugar and it's PERFECTLY sweet!  This is now my "go to" SLUSH punch!  The SLUSH texture really makes this punch extra special!  My family truly LOVES it!

Made this for my sister's baby shower today and it was a HIT! Every drop was gone by the end of the party and people were actually begging me for the recipe! I wonder if it would taste good with champagne, not for a baby shower of course. By the way, I only added 1 cup sugar and it was absolutely perfect! Any more and it would have been way too sweet.

A group of ladies and I get together once a month to play bunco so I brought this punch as a nice twist to our normal drink choices. Everyone loved it so much that it is now the groups OFFICIAL punch to be made for every bunco night! It made such a large amount so that I was able to add some watermelon rum to one and leave the other non-alcoholic so that everyone could be satisfied. Tasted just like a Jolly Rancher! YUM!!

Everyone loved it!  Ran out quickly and I made a double batch!  Used 2 cups sugar instead of 2 1/2.  Yummy!

I made a huge error in judgement when I made this, only making half a recipe.  Yikes, it went so fast, and was delicious.   I served this at my daughter's graduation party, and even had teenage boys asking for the recipe!  I froze the mix in Ziplock bags, and agree with other commenters to take the mix out of the freezer way in advance, it does take a long time to thaw.  I think I will next time freeze the mix in ice cube trays and have single serving punch on hand.  Wonderful recipe Valerie, thank you for sharing.

This was tasty - but I have to agree with the other reviews that said they had a hard time making it "slushy". Mine was frozen solid (I needed a lot for a suprise birthday party, so I made the night before) and even taking them out in advanced and hammering them didn't work so great.  However, it was tasty - so I'm willing to give it another go ...

Wonderful punch! I was asked so many times for the recipe! I wish I would have chilled the soda before I put it in the bowl because it melted the slush pretty quickly. Still, tasted great! Huge hit. Thanks!

I used 1&1/2  cups of sugar for this recipe, thinking the pineapple and orange juice would help sweeten it also. It turned out super yummy! Everyone at the baby shower really liked it! 
I also had to smash the chunks of frozen ice with a potato masher, but it worked!

This is very popular at our parties.  I make a double batch and the only problem is trying to divide up the bowls of mixture to freeze and then find room in the freezer for it all.  I may try freezer bags next time.

Yummy!  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and it was perfect!  I froze the slush in quart size bags so that if we didn't go through all of it I could save it for later.  I will be making this again in the future!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  We made a lot and froze the rest.  Three weeks later we had an impromptu large gathering at the house and scrambled around to pull off refreshments and viola!  We looked like we had it all planned... which was bad because the occasion was a funeral.  lol  Nevertheless, I think this is a really good recipe.  One note though, we tried it with Sprite and with Club soda and the Sprite was waaaay too sweet - club soda was perfect (Even for kids).  Thanks!

This is the best punch ever! I did only use about 1 cup of sugar though. And I froze it overnight in 2- 1 gallon size bags but it was still not "slushy" when I needed it at 3pm the next day. I would suggest freezing it two days ahead and just microwaving it to a slushy consistency when you are ready to use it. I suspect you could use other flavors of jello to make this different colors... The taste is amazing whether it's slushy or just a liquid. This will be my go-to punch recipe from now on!

This punch was SUPER good, but it did take some changes. The suguar, as most everyone has noted, is way too high. I knocked it down to one cup and still felt like it was a bit too sweet.  I tried this with ginger ale and hated it, but Sprite tasted great in there. I served it at my wedding reception and had people taking it home in flasks when they left....they loved it so much. I had one punch bowl with Sprite added for the non-alcoholic version and a different bowl with Sprite and Malibu Rum added for the adult version. Both were delish!!!

Use ginger ale.  We did a "dry run" to sample which kind of soda and alcohol tasted best.  We tried 7-up, sierra mist and sprite and the ginger ale was by far the best tasting.  I added a half bottle of the super-huge size vodka and no-one could tell, we probably could have added more.  Really great stuff!  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and put it in 2 gallon size zip-lock bags to freeze like other reviewers have suggested.  Leave out for a few hours so that it is more of a slush and not hard as a rock.

I made it with raspberry jello and it was wonderful. You definately need to take it out of the freezer awhile before you want to serve it. It was still completely frozen after an hour. It was tasty when it finally melted, but not slushy. Maybe I made it wrong or my freezer's too cold! I'll definately try again.

This is excellent punch, which is enjoyed buy children and adults.  It is always a hit when I make it.  I enjoy having two punch bowls worth -- it the party is big, enough for the night, or sometimes, enough for two different nights!

I decreased sugar to 1 2/3 cups, used 30 oz. pineapple juice (5- 6 oz. cans)and increased lemon juice to 1 cup and used wild strawberry jello as previously suggested. Great but not too sweet and pineapple did not overpower other flavors.  Received many requests for recipe.

The wait for freezing wasn't bad because I made alot of this a day before my party.  It was the making it into a slush that was a turn off.  I spent more time scraping the frozen mixture than entertaining!  I will use this again, but I will freeze it in small freezer bags, small bowls or icecube trays for more ease.  I gave this 4 1/2 stars.

I LOVE THIS PUNCH!!  I originally found this for a baby shower I was hosting and I now make it for every occasion that I can. Sometimes I even make it just because.  :)  I usually spike the second batch with a bottle of vodka for the adults.  It is wonderful!!

Made this punch for a baby shower.  Used 1 3/4 cup sugar and it was still way too much.  That's the only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.  I wanted blue punch so I made substitutions that someone else suggested: 1) berry blue jello instead of strawberry jello and 2) limeade instead of lemon juice and orange juice.  Unfortunately the pineapple juice still turned the punch green.  Had to use several drops of blue food color to get it to turn blue again.  Next time I will likely try substituting pina colada for the pinapple juice.  The picture I uploaded was taken right after I added the sprite so the punch looks really frothy and light colored.  It turned a deeper aqua color as it melted.  It did turn up very pretty and was a big hit with everyone.

Mmmm! I took some reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar.. I honestly wouldn't have minded the extra sugar, though. I did use sugar-free jello and I only found .3 ounce packages, so I wonder if the 3 ounce is a mistake?? Hm. It came out great either way. I didn't miss the extra sugar, but it was yummy with only 1 cup. If you do end up with a solid block of punch, you can easily scrape some of the ice if you just add a little bit of Sprite at a time. Thank you, Valerie! This is a great recipe and the whole family loved it :)

Love this recipe.  I have made this recipe several times (cutting down on the sugar) and I usually freeze this in disposable plastic containers which I divided into 4 portions to make a small batch at any time. :)

I wish I could give this six stars.  Only used one cup of sugar and sprite for the lemon-lime.  Effortless and amazing.  The guests had glass after glass.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe as written. I took the first bag out of freezer and put in punch bowl, and used a potato masher to break up somewhat and then added the lemon lime soda.

Made this for a shower and thought I'd only end up making one batch.  It went quickly, so I made the second batch up and everyone RAVED about it.  Thanks!  It is a really good punch for hot weather days.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I halved the sugar and that was gracious plenty.  I also used the tip to mash the slush was a potato masher in the punchbowl and that made it impressively easy to work with.

YUM! I split the recipe in half and made several batches so it was easier to pour in the zip lock bags. Make sure to take them out of the freezer in time to thaw out. It takes longer then you think. MAKE EXTRA! This punch tastes so good you will need more then you think. We drank every drop!

I made this for my daughter's wedding shower.  Everyone loved it.  I froze some rasberries and floated them in the punch. It looked beautiful. I too, only put one cup of sugar in it. I am making it again for another wedding shower.

I left out the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  I doubled the recipe and found it to be a little watered down.  Next time I'll use a little less water.  The flavor was good and guests all liked it.  it doesn't need too much time to get slushy before it just melts.

Excellent. Used 1c sugar and was too much for my taste with Gingerale.  Would omit the sugar completely and double the jello. Needs 48hrs to freeze or can quickly freeze with dry ice!

Made this punch for Christmas Eve and it was awesome! The flavour was wonderful. The kids and adults both enjoyed it. Adults can add a bit of vodka or rum if they like. It was cold and refreshing and easy to make. Thanks for a recipe I will use for years to come.

This has to be the best holiday punch our family has had. We made this for Thanksgiving. This was the biggest hit at my house. It made enough for all 13 people. I should have made more! It was gone in a matter of minutes! I had to revert to cans of sprite after it was gone. Funny thing was, my wife made this the day before. When I took it out of the freezer, I couldn't stop eating it even before we added the soda. I was just happy with my spoon digging in it! It was very good, everyone in our family expects us to make it again for christmas.

This punch was very popular at my daughter's 3 year old birthday. It is like a slush so a good idea for summer parties. I added the juice of two limes, which perked it up nicely. My husband had to do the mixing, which he said was very time-consuming (despite that I had frozen the mixture in small bowls). He said he had to 'nuke' it to soften it. It would be fun to experiment with different jello and juice flavors ie; lime or raspberry.

Wonderful! I reduced the sugar to one cup as suggested in the reviews. I may even reduce to 1/2 cup next time. This was the best punch I've ever had!

I just served this at a baby shower! I used only one cup of sugar and it turned out sweet enough. I think next time I'm going to use sugar free strawberry gelatin, stevia instead of sugar, and diet lemon-lime soda. It was delicious, but lots of sugar!!

I made this punch for a baby shower yesterday. my punch bowl was small so i cut everything in half.  I put in my bowl a half cup of sugar, 3 cups of water, 1 box of the strawberry gelatin, half can of pineapple juice, 1/3 cup of lemon juice, half quart of orange juice and 1 2liter of sprite. If you are in a hurry and dont have time for all the freezing and making it a "slushy punch" i highly suggest doin like i did and just add VANILLA ICE CREAM!..   made this punch in less then 5 minutes by just mixing all of the ingredients together and making it cold by adding the vanilla ice cream. I promise you the punch was gone before half the shower was over. I actually asked the crowd myself what would they rate this punch on scale 1-10 and literally EVERYONE said an 11!..   Ill definitely be making this punch on every occassion!

This is our new favorite punch.  I made it for Christmas Day.  I intended to only use one package but we ended up needing both because it was so popular.  I used one strawberry jello and one cherry, and the pop I used was raspberry ginger ale.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups but will cut down to 1 cup next time.  
I haven't EVER had a better punch.

Never a drop left and everyone asks for the recipe. I keep some on hand in the freezer for parties. It's also great for adult night frozen cocktails :-)  This is a permanent recipe for my house.

Yummy! I reduced the sugar too and found it just perfect. Easy and fun, good for a crowd. Great that you can split the recipe in half in case you don't go through the whole first batch you can save the rest.

This punch is awesome!  If you have a problem thawing it out or freezing it, then I can't help you go back to beginning cooking/baking!  If I don't make it the group when I have them over, I get disappointing looks!  Always have to double or triple it!  Would give it more stars if I could!  We are having a clam bake this weekend and going to make it for the group again.  Made it with Splenda and regular sugar and didn't change the taste.  NOW I can drink it w/o guilt!  GREAT RECIPE!!

Wonderful!  This batch goes a long way but it also goes FAST!  We made it as described but with slightly less sugar and it was fantastic.  Those who wanted to spiked their punch wih Coconut Rum which was a great combination - made a very tropical drink!   This time for a baby shower I used one orange and one lemon jello to get a nice bright orange color, only 1/3 cup lemon juice, one frozen lemonaide concentrate, and only about a half cup of sugar.  It is a nice change in flavor - slightly tarter with all the citrus and very good!

I made 4 gallons for my sons birthday figuring I would have a bunch left over to store in the freezer for another time. Nope. We ended up drinking it all! I froze some citrus slices and added them when it started to turn more liquid than slush which made it prettier to look at. People were really surprised when I mentioned jello was in the mix! Even my father in law, who is not a punch drinker at all, came back for more!

This punch was great! Made for mothers day, and didn't have any left, however I had lots of iced tea left!! :) I actually used Raspberry Gelatin instead of Strawberry, as my family is not a fan of artificial strawberry flavored food or drink. I will be keeping this one!!

Great Recipe.  I was a little hesitant, as I don't like sweet drinks, but this had great flavor and not sweet like I was thinking.  Made it for my daughter's baby shower, it was all gone 2 hrs into the shower.  We had about 30 people.  I'll definitely double the recipe for any large parties.  I used Ginger Ale and topped with Strawberries and Blackberries.  Making again this weekend for girl's night, but adding champagne in place of carbonated soda.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe. Everyone loved this at our party yesterday. Only thing I changed was that I used 1 cup sugar. Next time I will make it with no added sugar as the 7-up added lots of sweetness on it's own.

I made this for a christmas party. Big hit with the kids but I think most of the adults found it a little sweet (even though I had already cut back a bit on the sugar).

WOW! Never gets watery, and was a complete hit. We went though 4 gallons. I also made the lemon lime soda slightly slushy, and it stayed cold for hours.

This is an awesome recipe!  I've made it for several recent get togethers with family and friends and it has been a huge hit.  I made some for our New Years celebration tonight. We used club soda in one of the punch bowls that we put together and it was crisp and refreshing.  I like to slice up fresh lemons to float on top.  Thank you Valerie for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Fabulous!!! Made this for a party yesterday, and it was amazing. Worth the little bit of extra effort to boil and freeze. I added a few scoops of lime sorbet to make it more festive...so so good!!! Two punch bowls gone quickly!!

This is an outstanding recipe.  Made a double batch for a party of 40 (essentially 4 punch bowls full).  Every DROP was gone! For some reason, this is especially a hit with the men. They raved over it and drank cup after cup!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I knew the compliments were sincere when 2 months later one of the men came up to me at a church reception and told me our hospitality ladies needed to get rid of their punch and get mine! :)

Made this for bunco.  It's really good and really easy, which is the best part.  I cut the sugar back to 1 C., used ginger ale and low sugar orange juice.  It was perfect and still sweet.  I may even try to cut the sugar back to 3/4 C. next time b/c too sweet makes me cringe.  For a party, you can't beat this recipe.  You can make it well ahead (weeks) and pull it out shortly before you need it (if frozen solid, 1 hour to get alittle mushy.)  One question, there isn't a suggestion on how much vodka to add ... we winged it.

I made this for my sister-in-law and brother's baby shower on Saturday and made it for 100 servings (4 punch bowls full).  We ran out in about 30 minutes!  Everyone loved it to say the least.  I sliced strawberries to float on top.  It was beautiful and delicious!

MMMMM it was great....I put the liquid into Huge Ziplock bags...and set them inside of two large bowls, just in case they leaked, they didnt, and then the next morning took them to my parents for fathers day lunch. We used the first bag and mixed it with seven up, as my husband bought that soda thinking it would be better than gingerale....WRONG!! The gingerale was REALLLLLLY good...it was perfect...it gave the punch the pizazz without stealing the flavor like the seven up did...unless you're a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of seven up....dont go with it...for me seven up reminds me of being a kid, and having adults buy me that through the drive thu at mcdonalds because sprite doesnt stain/no caffeine...well the taste just seems grose to me...but this was delish with bag number two which I used yesterday...a few weeks after fathers day weekend.....it froze solid, and slushed up with the room temperature gingerale, and was a HUGE hit with my either year old nephew... who's starting to get into cooking....for the fourth of july im going to make this with him, along with red white and blue cake...where we put the colored drops into the cake batter (blue, red) and white frosting...he's adorable, but anyways im rambling on, THIS FIVE STARS...wooo hoo!!

I had to make a punch for a banquet (about 100 people) and this recipe was awesome! It was easy to make and I received many compliments and requests for the recipe. People loved it! I think I drank 6 glasses myself! After reading other reviews, I also cut the sugar in half (1 1/4c.) and next time I will probably only use 1 cup, maybe less. With the juices and soda added, you really don't need very much additional sugar. It has a refreshing sweet taste, not overly sugary. The punch, before the soda is added makes about 1 gallon (64 oz. of mixture for each bottle of soda), so I froze the mixture in 1 gallon containers overnight. I didn't want it to be too slushy so I put it in the fridge the next morning and by 5:00 it had thawed to where it was easy to pour but still slightly slushy. Once I added the chilled soda, the rest of the mixture melted and it was just the right temperature. I like that it doesn't use sherbert and that the punch mixture is made up in advance so that you're not adding 3 or 4 different ingrediants to refill the punch bowl. Not only is this recipe super easy, but becuase you can change jello flavors it can be very versatile. You can always change the flavor to get a different color punch - especially fun for showers and holiday parties!

Perfect punch!

Doubling the recipe made four gallons of punch, and the 35 people at our Memorial Day cookout drank every drop!

I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups per recipe, used raspberry jello, and cut the 6 cups of water by using 3 cups of rum instead. For soda I added half gingerale and half lemon-lime and it was good and tangy.

WARNING: we couldn't taste the rum! it seemed strong in the concentrate that I froze, but after adding the soda it was imperceptible. I think this is a good thing, because it still was potent, but thought I'd let ya'll know for your own taste.

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit.  I would suggest starting to thaw the punch 30-45 minutes before you want to serve it.  Very yummy!

This recipe was loved by everyone no exceptions! I'll defintely make this again.  I froze it in 2 2l containers (with a little leftover) and put the containers in the fridge the night before.  They came out perfect. I think next time I'll add a bit less sugar.  The end of the punch (once the slush was gone) was too sweet...that sweetness wasn't noticable when it was slushy though.  Very convenient to be able to make ahead of time.

Aloha Kaua e Mele Kalikimaka me ke Houoli Makahiki Hou!  Aloha everyone, and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!  I made this punch yesterday for my open house (apt.)... as with the major majority, it was a hit.  A dozen people killed 2 punch bowls (modified, I mixed in a gallon pitcher) in a few hours.  I froze in 4 cup containers; about half-way frozen (10 hrs) I stired the mix, this helps to keep from freezing solid.  An hour before the party I moved the containers from the freezer to the fridge.  I was able to scoop the mix into the pitcher and add beverage to easily mix into slush.  Be createive, I used; Strawberry/Kiwi, Orange/Passion, Pineapple and Lemon juice, with a Ginger Ale mixer, it looked like beer.  The moment it touched lips the receipe was reqeusted.  Mahalo nui.

This punch was absolutely delicious. I served it at our dinner party and it went over very well. Thanks for the hint to use 2 one gallon freezer bags it worked out very well. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Delicious! I served this at my son's 2nd birthday party and it was gone by the end of the party. Everyone drank this instead of soda. I took another reviewer's advice and let it cool an hour before putting it in freezer bags. I highly recommend this punch!

I had a large party and tried this receipe on those in attendance. THEY LOVED IT!!! The only thing I would add is to have a blender handy to help smooth the mixture out before blending it with the soda. It was an easy, and inexpensive drink that satisfied everyone.

We had this for a baby shower instead of the traditional sherbert punch.  Everyone loved it! I couldn't get the 2nd batch fast enough.  We'll be having this for XMAS too.

Used Sprite and decreased sugar to 1.5 cups, loved it! Put in freezer at 5PM in two zip locks, took out placed on counter at 11:30AM for 1PM baby shower. Broke it up with spoon in punch bowl, poured chilled sprite over, turned out perfect and slush lasted for couple hours!

I made a small batch and froze it in muffin tins. I can take out just a couple of the "muffins" and make enough for one or a few. Handy, dandy and tasty on a hot summer day. Added a shot of rum at Happy Hour and I had a strawberry daiquiri. Thanks for sharing!

I reduced the sugar that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  I made a half recipe and used 1/2 cup sugar.  It was super luscious.  This is a new favortie at our house.

Wow! This punch was so delicious! I made it for my sister's bridal shower and it was gone literally within minutes! Next time I will know to make a double or triple batch! Also it goes great with the premixed margarita tequila. We bought watermelon flavor and added it to our own individual cup. Sooooo good! I followed a tip from another reviewer about 1 cup of sugar. It was the perfect amount. 2 and 1/2 cups would have probably been too sweet for me. Thanks so much Valerie!!!!

Yummy!!!! Everyone at our New Year's party enjoyed this adults & kids alike. Made this as stated with the exception of the sugar, used slightly less than a cup. Froze the mixture in 12 square containers used for freezing vegetables/applesauce. First batch hadn't quite frozen, 2nd batch later in the evening was perfect!! Nice and slushy as stated in the recipe. Will make again.

YUM, loved it, only did 1 cup sugar, so it wasn't too sweet, loved it YUM will use it again, the kids loved and with a bit of Bacardi for the adults it tasted great too.  I did the ziplock bags and although it didn't freeze the whole way through it was pretty slushy when we got there.  Also we used Lemon/Lime mineral water which worked just as well.  Thank you will be doing this one again  :)

Made this punch for a birthday party & froze it in Halloween shaped ice cubes / molds.  It received many compliments from adults to kids.  I made it with sugar free jello and diet 7-up.  Had cocunut rum to the side for the adults to add it.  Very good!

This punch is simply fantastic.  I've made it for christmas parties and smaller get togethers, and it always goes over very well.  My friends tend to like "adult" versions of drinks more, so I add 1-1.5L of 80 proof vodka to make it a bit more fun for grown-ups!  Fantastic recipe, I've shared it with many people.

Valerie Lynne, i trusted you and 650 other reviews and you were all right, so that makes me 651.  I'm not a punch drinker, nor is my extended family, but as quoted the bowl will be empty and it was before late evening.  The adults and kids loved it.  Then the adults found that it was perfect to add a little rum or vodka in their cup to make it a merrier Christmas party.  I'm convinced that it should be named, The best  punch ever, that's what I called it and everyone laughed and wanted the recipe. Lil Bobby

I get complaints and sour looks if I forget to bring this punch with me to functions! I always have some in the freezer ready to make.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but mine didn't have a slushy consistency.  I followed the recipe exactly and removed from the freeaer about 2 hours before serving.  It went from large chunks of ice eventually disolving into liquid, no slush...still a great flavor, although a bit disappointed on consistency.

I made this for a baby shower, so I used blue raspberry jello instead in an attempt to make "baby blue" punch.  It tasted great, but looked a little like ectoplasm (Ghost Busters;).  I got compliments from almost everyone at the shower and we went through the entire recipe for about 30 people.

Great recipe!  I made it for a work lunch potluck event and everyone loved it.  I used ginger ale and added more if I felt like the punch was getting too sweet.

I never volunteer to do the punch as I'm not gifted in that area.  However, I served this (vocal recital for my son) and it was an overwhelming success with all ages!  Used the gallon freezer bags and it worked great.  Love the idea of keeping it "ready to go" in the freezer.

This punch is amazing! I would give it a million stars if I could. Here's what I did when I made this fantastic punch...I made this slush the night before my party so that it could freeze overnight, only using 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/2. I used (2) Gallon freezer bags and laid them flat in the freezer. I took the bags out 3 hours before the party to let them thaw. After the 3 hours passed, I emptied the frozen concoction into a stock pot, mashed it lightly with a potato masher, and stirred in 3 liters of Sprite and 1 Bottle (750 mL) of Grey Goose L'Orange Vodka.  I then threw the mix into a punch bowl and topped it off with frozen peach slices, maraschino cherries, and 5 scoops of Edy's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. It was truly delicious and EVERYONE requested a copy of the recipe!

I do have a another punch I usually make but it can be very pricey as it contains a lot of different types of alcohol so I gave this a try!  Sooo glad I did!  I made it as it says and then added a bottle of mango rum to the already frozen part, along with a little peach tree schnapps and sprite zero.  I also only used a cup of sugar and it was PLENTY sweet enough so I am glad I cut it back.  My guests raved about how yummy it was!!!

OMG best punch ever. I have taken this to every baby shower, wedding, anniversary and holiday. I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar as suggested by some of the reviews and that was perfect. SO GOOD. Make sure you write the recipe down before you leave the house, you will have at least 3 people ask for it during your event! Take it out at least 3 hours prior to your event in order to make it easy to slush with a potato masher or spoon before you pour the lemon lime soda over it.

We served this last night at a party. My husband said it tasted like Hawaiian punch mixed with 7-up. We had over 35 people at the party, this was the only drink served, we had a lot leftover and people were going to a vending machine to buy drinks. . .even the kids weren't very impressed with it. We won't make this again.

this was the perfect punch.  Full of fruity flavors.  I used gingerale, and cut the sugar down to a cup.  Everyone loved it and there was not one drop left after my party.  I do recommend that you freeze the slush atleast 24hours before you plan to serve because it takes a while for the liquid in the gllon bag to freeze up. Thanks for sharing I will be making this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated (with the exception of adding rum) for a big house warming picnic. I doubled the recipe (yes, it was a HUGE punch bowl) and it was nearly finished by the end of the night. Everyone raved about it!

UPDATED!!!! OK, I have looked at MANY punch recipes for a baby shower I am having this coming weekend.  I think I have decided to try this one out.  I think I might try to make it blue though, since it's for a baby boy.  I read many of the reviews saying any jello will work; cut the sugar in half; use unsweetened pineapple juice; try gingerale ... I will let you know how it turns out!  I am excited to try it out!   Ok, so I made the punch with 1 (and not quite 1/2) a cup of sugar, used ginger ale and left everything else as is...like the recipe called for; with the exception of using blue jello.  And it was GREAT!  Everyone loved it, said it was so refreshing with the cake (balanced out the sweetness of the cake) and cleansed the palate!  So I was thrilled with this punch and will definatly use it again!

WOW!  My kids helped me make this for my middle daughter's birthday and it was so good.  I had people asking me for the recipe.  I'm making it for a bridal shower soon.  I followed the suggestion of reducing the sugar and I'm glad that I did.

I froze this several days ahead. Punch was a hit....problem was I didn't get any. I made a double batch making 4 gallon ziploc bags as suggested. I took only 3 to party and if I had 4 it would have gone as well. I had only a taste out of my daughters cup. I cut the sugar to 1 3/4, but I may try using all the sugar next time to cut the tart and see how it compares. The slush was perfect come party time. I put 3 bags in the fridge about noon the day before the party (party at 10 am the next day). I checked it before going to bed and it was still quite frozen. The next morning still frozen, but could feel it was going to break apart nicely. Loaded 3 bags in a small igloo. They were in the cooler for 2 hours. I think they could have stayed in the fridge until needed if the party was at my home. When ready I dumped a bag in the bowl and used a butter knife to separate the "block" to a slush, then pured in refrigerated soda. If you break it up first your pieces won't clump together. If any clumped I broke them up by picking them up with the punch server and separated it with the knife.

We made this for a luau birthday party. We served it along with tea and lemonade. I had an extra gallon of both left over and no punch. My son absolutely loved it and has been asking me to make it for him again (it's only been 1 day!!!) This recipe is definately a keeper.

This was good, but the main problem I had was that it didn't melt fast enough. Basically I served 7-Up with a block of frozen punch in the middle of the punch bowl. When the guests left 3 hours later it was just about right. It was slushy. I still have the one container frozen and will serve it at a party in 2 weeks, but I am going to let it defrost about an hour before the party before pouring 7-Up over it.

When I was young, my Mom was always "the punch lady" for church receptions, so for her 95th birthday I decided to serve punch to her--I chose this recipe and she loved it! My only change was to divide into four smaller portions to fit into one of her old Wexford crystal bowls. I ended up using exactly half the recipe for 12 people, because everyone kept going back for seconds & thirds. We still have some frozen so next time might try some Asti Spumante instead of the soda for an adult version!

Served this yesterday at a bridal shower for 85 women and it was a huge success!  I made 4 "batches" and froze it about a week ahead of the shower.  I put it in punch bowls about an hour before the shower started and it was perfect.  I also used ginger ale instead of the lemon-lime soda.  I had two punch bowls going - one with vodka and one without.  Of course the one with vodka was the most popular.  I came home with a list of email addresses from guests who wanted the recipe.

This recipe was very good except It is better with 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 1/2 cups. I made it both ways and the 2 1/2 cups made it to sweet. But it is an excellent recipe and it tastes very very good. I recommend it to everyone who likes punch!

This is a really awesome punch. I was a little paranoid that others said to cut back on the sugar, which I did use 2 cups. Still a little sweet, but, hello, it's punch! I might use 1-1/2 cups next time. Beware this does make a ton of punch - so start w/ a big pan. I froze in 2 Rubbermaid containers and thought later that I should have used a jello mold ring or something. Plus, how neat this would be in the summer to freeze as punch ice cubes and just pop them into a glass whenever and pour the lemon lime soda over. I used Sierra Mist Free and it was excellent! Thanks for a keeper!

This is sooo good. I made it for a party at school, and it was gone very quickly. It's actually quite hard to get the mix out though if you don't take it out a couple of hours early, and I like it better completely melted.

I made this punch for a bridal shower last weekend and it was absolutely GREAT!!!  Very sweet and tangy and just delicious.  We received so many compliments from our guests.  I do agree with the suggestion about giving the punch plenty of time to defrost and get slushy - it is hard like a rock out of the freezer and it would have taken forever to "slush up" in the punch bowl on its own.  We popped the bags in the microwave turning over after each cycle and it was perfect.  Thank you for this recipe - we will definately make this again!!

At my party of 60 people of mixed ages last weekend, this punch scored a big hit.  My punchbowl is large and holds the entire recipe in one round.  I made 5 "rounds" for this party, and 3 were gone in the first 90 minutes, and the next two shortly there after.  I used sugar-free Jello, and Diet Sierra Mist soda to offset the high sugar content a little, and I placed a bottle of vodka next to the punchbowl as an option.  One hint:  using Ziploc bags is a perfect idea, but don't use a cheap knockoff.  I had an explosion in my freezer!  This recipe was highly requested and is reason enough to regret selling your punchbowl in a yardsale!

You will 100% not be disappointed if you make this wonderful, tasty punch.  I made it for a shower I catered without trying it first.  It was by far the biggest hit!  Easy and lushious!  Enjoy!!!

Very good! I did two things wrong....I was making two different recipes and the other one used ginger ale. I put ginger ale in this one by accident. I also read the recipe wrong and only used 1/2 of a two liter for each batch. I have never gotten so many compliments on a punch!! It was excellent. I froze mine in freezer bags, make sure you have enough time to freeze, I put mine in the freezer at about 6 o'clock at night and took them out at 12:30 pm the next day. One was just barely slushy and the other one hadn't started freezing yet. I'd probably freeze two days in advance.

Great tasting punch! I made it for a new year's party and it was a good thing I had made an extra batch. I Froze it in gallon freezer bags which worked great. Some of us opted to add some pineapple/coconut rum to our glasses. That was great too!

Very good punch! The first time I made punch and I actually ran out (even though 1 batch made 2 bowl fulls)! My ratio was 1 bottle of soda though for each portion, to keep the flavor from being to weak. So I used this recipe with 2 bottles of soda.

Another 5 star recipe.  I couldn't imagine Jell-o in a punch but with all the good reviews I tried it.  Wonderful!  Wonderful punch!  I got praises galore and had to give out the recipe.  I will replace this punch recipe with the one I usually make.  Thanks.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. I first thought it was way too sweet. We added more sprite and some more water. It's good to keep some in the freezer when people come over.

Excellent!!!  I made this punch for a family gathering around christmas and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!
 I had kids ranging from ages 16 to 3 1/2 about 12
kids and they all loved it. I made THREE punch bowls and every drop was gone. My husband, my brother and my brother-in-law loved it also. My two boys ages 5 and 7 asked me to make it again the next day.  I will be making this one again REAL SOON.    Lori

I just made this for 250 people.  It was a big hit!! Make sure you allow enough time for it to thaw  (some) before you put it into a punch bowl. I loved the fine, mushy slush texture.  It wasn't too sweet----just right.

Made it for a party and it was a huge hit with children as well as adults!  Made 2 punch bowls and have none left!  I did reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Most importantly, I put it in the freezer overnight and took it out around 9 a.m. the next morning and although my party wasn't until 8 the next evening, I am thankful I did.  The slush was perfect!

This punch is AMAZING! I did what most have suggested and only used a little over a cup of sugar. Glad I did, the punch was PERFECT!!! After bringing the mixture to a boil we let it cool down and then poured it into two gallon size freezer bags.

Everyone enjoyed this punch, I made it for a bridal shower, using peach jello, orange-tangerine juicy juice and orange juice.  I was told it tasted just like a fuzzy navel drink.  I thought so too.  The only drawback was getting it to be slushy.  So I think the next time I will use my Pampered chef ice shaver and go from there.  But wil be making it and using it again and again and again.  You are only limited by the flavors of juice and jello you can find.l

I made this for a work event.  I wanted to make it as near sugar free as I could get it.  Use sugar free jello, sub'd splenda in place of sugar and only use 1.5 cups and use diet lemon lime soda.  It was a hit!  Had many people asking for the recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe! All the guest loved it and wanted the recipe. I fallowed the recipe exactly and halved it again. I was also serving lemonade and thought for sure I would have enough for a 2 hour retirement open house for my mother. NO! Everyone loved it so much I ran out. The only bad thing about this recipe is that you can't make more on a moments notice!

Very good! This made enough for 1 serving to be served at the party and i have one still frozen. It does, however, need to be made a day before to make sure it gets frozen. I didn't know that before I made it and just had to serve it chilled instead of as a slushy. Still great!

Found this recipe, and stopped looking for the perfect punch recipe.  So easy to cut in half for smaller gatherings, and great to have made ahead.  We enjoy it with vodka, perfect for the adults!

Very good punch!  Made it as stated word for word. Served it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Our biggest problem was finding something to serve it in!  Could not find the punch bowl to save our lives.  We ended up using a big oval crockpot.

I agree, this is the best recipe for slush punch I have ever used. I used one package each of peach and orange flavored gelatin. It was good with either lemon-lime or grapefruit soda.

I made this for a football game party and it was the hit of the party!!  I followed others reviews and cut the amount of sugar (to 1 3/4 cups) and it was PERFECT! I froze mine for about four hours (decided to make this at the last minute) and it turned out  nice and slushy.  I then mixed the slush with 7-Up and served.  This went so fast that I will have to double the recipe next time!

This punch is delicious!!  Very pretty too.  It was a big hit at my daughter's baby shower today.  We had about 50 people and I had tripled the recipe, so I brought six 1 gallon baggies of punch with me, and we used four, so doubling it for a party of 50 was perfect.  I took the advice of others and cut the sugar in half, and it was perfect.  The strawberries in the punch were really good too.  Yum!!  This is my favorite punch recipe ever.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Thank you so much!!

This punch was soooo good. I also used only 1 cup of sugar and it tasted great. The first time I made it with my 8 year old, I was so concerned that she did not get burned - well, I mixed all the ingredients and boiled them together! It still turned up great. I had to make this in two different pots (as my serving bowls is not so big), and poured it in 2 zipploc bags just as one of the reviewers suggested. I placed it on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer. It was space saving and easy to transport to the party. I made it twice (the second time my hubby bought everything sugar free and it was still good) and will be making it this Saturday for my daughter's 4th birthday. Thank you so much Valerie for such a wonderful recipe.

Try it with CLUB SODA (unsweetened carbonated water, instead of lemon-lime soda) and use the sugar amounts listed; it comes out great, not too sweet.  This let's you skip the HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) that's in the pre-sweetened soda drinks.  I only made two other small changes using a raspberry and a strawberry gelatin (I was doubling the recipe) and my lemon and orange juice were organic variety.  Very well received at the violin recital reception yesterday.  Several requests for the recipe.

Yum!  Used one cup of sugar and froze in two gallon-sized freezer bags.  Pulled one bag out an hour before serving and the other one when the punch bowl was about half empty.

This punch is excellent!  Everyone loved it.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as some others suggested and used Ginger Ale.  Also, put it in 2 - 1 gallon baggies and laid it on its side in the freezer.  Took out 2 1/2 hrs before the party.  Could have sat out longer to be easier to mix.  Yummy!

WOW!  This punch is really good!  I couldn't wait to try to first batch for the mixture to freeze, so as soon as it was cold, I added 1 liter of Squirt and ice cubes and it was super delicious!  The next day I made it with the frozen mixture and the slush was amazing, too!

Made this for a Baby shower, and it was amazing!! Everyone commented on it and said it was the best punch they ever had. It didn't take long to thaw after freezing in 2 ziploc bags, except my punch bowl must be big because, I put the whole recipe (2 bags) in one bowl! YUM, I love slushy punch!

Fantastic! I made this for my bunko party especially for all of my pregnant friends, and spiked it for everyone else by the glass. It was a huge hit. My pregnant friends were happy to have a drink that made them feel like an adult. They also started to guard the punch bowl as it started to run out, saying "this drink is for the pregnant people only". I will warn you to take TUMS, as it is very acidic.

A winner! And the best part is its so interchangeable - you can really use any flavor of jello with this recipe. And I agree with everyone else - definitely put only half the sugar!

Very good Punch. Most non-alcoholic punches remind me of kiddie birthday parties but this one doesn't. I used the entire recipe and it filled my punch bowl. Had hardly any left at a party with many other drinks available.

Okay - What in the world was the big deal with this punch - let me tell you - IT IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
At first I added just 1 1/2 cups sugar thinking it would be plenty.  After tasting the second set of ingredients I thought that the full amount of sugar would be just right.  I am so glad I followed it to the letter!  It was so good and so deliciously slushy! All I can say is..Try it and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!  100 STARS FOR THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!

This punch was a HIT at the baby shower last week! It was a large baby shower so I made two batches (100 servings) and all 40 people that were at this shower drank it all. Both batches I made only had 1.5 cups of sugar as I was worried with other peoples reviews about it being TOO sugary! But with the 1.5 cups of sugar - it was DELICIOUS!

This was so delicious!  I made it for our housewarming party and everyone raved about it!  This is a great alternative to regular soda, not to mention refreshing on a hot summer day!  I did cut back on the amount of sugar, just used half a cup and it's plenty sweet.  Besides, with the lemon lime soda, strawberry jello, pineapple and orange juice, I prefer more of a tart punch.  5 stars!

I foolishly halved this.  You'll need to make the whole batch, because it's gonna go quickly (Mine didn't even last an hour!!).  Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup (still pretty sweet).  Froze it in a bundt pan, due to lack of freezer bags.  (Had to warm it for a minute or two in the oven to get it to drop out of the pan!)  Also, used Ginger Ale, and then floated fresh halved strawberries on top.  This will be made again and again!!!

Wonderful!   Made it for a bridal shower and everyone loved this and asked for the recipe. I did take others advice and I substituted 3 cups of water for 3 cups of vodka.  I did forget to take it out of the freezer before hand to let it get slushy but nobody seemed to mind.  Will absolutely make this again.

I have made this punch several times and always hear rave reviews. I accidently scaled it to 25 servings, but still divided it for 2 punch bowls using 1 2-liter for each frozen "block" and it is the perfect sweetness. I can't imagine having it any sweeter, so I keep making it this way - so if you make the full recipe, you could divide it 4 ways! That's a lot of punch!!!

Very good, and easy to make. Love it when things can be done in advance. The kids couldn't get enough of it. Froze in 2 plastic gallon bags like others suggested. What a breeze. Thanks for a great recipe.

I added strawberry ice cream or sherbert to punch 30 min before serving. Also added fresh sliced strawberries. Make sure you use room temp soda and pour over frozen jello before adding the ice cream otherwise the punch gets too cold and isn't slushy.Punch was a huge success on Christmas eve. Since I put it into 2 containers to freeze, I took the second container to a party on Christmas day where it again was the talk of the party. We'll be making this a traditional drink on Christmas.

This punch was really goood! My suggestion would be to decrease the amount of sugar, we also used diet sprite. Really good whether it's slushy or not!

Very Good!!  We followed the recipe exactly (using most pulp orange juice)and it was not too sweet for us--sweet enough yet still quite tangy.  We froze it in quart ziploc bags (five--none quite full).  We put some of the frozen portion in the punch bowl, broke it up a little bit and just added soda as it melted.  Altogether we used all the frozen part and 3 two liters of soda.  It worked out quite well.  It was very very yummy!  Everyone (from Great Grandma to two year old) loved it!!  UPDATE:  Try using orange jello and ginger ale for a twist!  We did this once and were not disappointed.  I'll make it with strawberry sometimes and with orange sometimes; good to switch it up.

This is great!! I only added 2 cups of sugar and used 7up (lemonade for us Aussies) and gingerale as the liquid.  This recipe made just enough for our 15 guests!! Take the frozen mix out of the freezer about 20 mins. before you need it and stab it with a knife until broken up, it will take a while to do so its self otherwise.

This punch was really good.  I made it for a holiday party and it was gone before everyone left.  Next time I will double this recipe!  I made this punch a day ahead of time and left it outside in the snow,  I got lucky with the snow...I'm in Ohio...I was afraid if I put it in the freezer then left it out a few hours before the party that it wouldn't be thawed when the guests arrived.  The only thing that I might change next time is reducing the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  The 2 1/2 cups made the punch really sweet.  I'd rather have it have a  little "punch" than too much sweetness.  Other than that,  this is a great recipe!!!  Thank you!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  Made this punch for a bridal shower this weekend and it was a hit!  It was a very hot day and this punch was just the ticket. A wonderfully fruity and fizzy punch with just the right amount of icy slush.    Just make sure you take your frozen punch "base" out of the freezer a bit ahead of time so it can thaw some before you put your soda in.

This was an excellent punch.  I made it for my sister's engagement party and it went quick adn I received many compliments.  I put the mixture into one gallon milk containers and it was difficult to get out, so I will definetly use the ziploc bag idea next time.  Great Job!

This was wonderful punch!  I received many compliments and inquiries as to how it was made.  I froze the first ingredients in four 1 quart freezer bags and then about an hour before serving I thawed in the microwave slightly before adding the soda.  I "mashed" the frozen part with a potato masher and it made it nice and slushy.  I will definitely make this again.  Our family drank it for probably 3 nights as it made a large amount.  Thanks for sharing.

Thank you so much, Valerie, for this great punch recipe! Every drop was gone by the end of the party. I used 2 - 1 gallon freezer bags to keep the slush in (as another reviewer suggested). This worked really well. Will definitely make this one again.

This is a very good punch recipe; however, I found it a little too sweet.  I think I'll cut back on the sugar as I found the sweetness a little overwhelming.  Take it out of the freezer a few hours in advance and mush it with a masher or fork before adding the pop for a slush consistency.  To get it out of the container straight from the freezer, place the container for a few minutes in hot water :)

This was really a hit for Christmas day.  I used Wild Strawberry jello.  Also found it helpful to start breaking apart the frozen mixture before adding the 7Up.  Next year will halve the amount of sugar...

The punch was good enough, but ours never was slushy. I froze the punch 2 days ahead & it was a solid block. (Reminded me of the ice rings I used to make for punch). I don't know how one reviewer could scoop it out of her freezer because mine was solid! It eventually melted in the punch bowl but never made a slush. I still have the second container left, so I will take it out several hours early next time I plan to serve it.

Yum! This was the best punch. I had a cook-out and 5 people asked me for the recipe. Everyone wanted to know how I made it. It is very delicious!

I had 20 poeple at my party and I made a double batch and it still wasn't enough. Everybody just keep drinking it.  My mother-in-law thought this was the best punch she had ever had. I think so too. This was the party!!!!

This was a big hit with my whole family. I served it on Thanksgiving day and everybody enjoyed it, especially my 4yr.old. It is very rich, but definately a good choice.

AWESOME. Used this past Sunday for my son's open house. I would recommend letting it set out and thaw some before using as it froze up in my decanter and I couldn't get it to go out the spigot. Punch bowl wouldn't matter.

i tried this recipe last weekend for a friend's birthday party. i prepared it a couple of days ahead using half the amount of ingredients & only 2 tablespoons of sugar and froze the mixture in a gallon bag. i brought out the frozen mix about 5 hours ahead and we had to break it up without too much effort and added a 2 litre bottle of sprite. i sliced up an orange and added it to it. IT WAS A BIG HIT. It was all gone in about one hour. i saw a couple of people trying to drain out the last bit of it. several people asked if i made another batch and some others came up to me wanting the recipe. i am giving it a four star because the sugar is way too much but otherwise it turned out great. i will be making this again. 
oh!! i poured the punch into a bowl that had about 1-2 cups of lemonade in it and it gave the drink an extra kick

Loved it! I made it for Father's Day and my husband was fixated on it the second he tasted it. He wants me to give it a 6 star rating. I used 1and a half cups of sugar and agree with other reviewers that it would be perfect with 1 cup.

I have made this twice now, the first time with 1/2 half the recommended sugar and the second time with no sugar added.  Everyone happily drank it with no added sugar.  There is so many sweet ingredients in it the extra sugar just isn't needed.

Best punch recipe to date! Freezing in 2 gallon size bags worked really well (kept them in a large casserole during freezing and thawing in case of leakage) and cutting back the sugar by 1 cup also helped! Took the bags out two hours before serving and added the lemon-lime soda 15 min. before serving. Stayed slushy for almost 2 hours! Love, love, love!!!

Made this for my daughter's wedding and it was great.  Followed the suggestion of dividing into gallon size Ziploc bags and freezing ahead of time.  Took our about 2 hours ahead and added one liter of lemon/lime soda per bag into punch bowl...GREAT!

Super easy, really great for a large group. Made this for a crowd. The taste was delicious, and it stayed cold all day long without needing ice cubes that would water down the taste. I froze it in gallon freezer bags.  Will be using this anytime I need refreshments for a crowd.

Good punch.  Agreed with other reviewers that it was too sweet so I just cut back on the sugar.  Didn't freeze it because I needed to put it into a dispenser.  Worked out well.

Very tasty.  We did not add alcohol, but premium vodka or rum would be a great addition.  Next time, I will replace the lemon-lime soda with gingerale - just as a personal preference.

This will be the third year I've made this punch. Guests from back then are asking if I will serve this punch again! We went through two patches in one evening. The kids went nuts with it. Adults can add their own spirits to the punch if they like. Make sure to prepare ahead and freeze then you can have ready for any event!  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

I found this recipe online and tried it at a shower. It went so fast I had to make more in a pinch. I modified it some to make it less slushy for our punch container and tap. I made it exactly how it reads but made a block of ice with 4.5 cups of water, 1 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup lemon juice and 3 oranges sliced in a bowl. Added that and over time it unfroze and added a nice flavor of orange to it. The orange slices gave it a nice touch to look at. I have already give this recipe out to about 30 people for their parties coming up this holiday season.

This punch is DELICIOUS !!!  I made this for my step-daughter's baby shower ....BIG HIT !!! And since it starts frozen, turns into slush and stays cold.  I did follow another readers suggestion and I only used 1 cup of sugar.

This is so good ! I made this for a bridal shower and before we even served the cake, it was GONE. I can honestly say this is the BEST punch I have EVER tasted and I will continue to make it. I am almost tempted to make it just to drink at my house. :)

I made this for a summer BBQ and it was a HUGE hit.  This recipe makes enough to last an entire party.  I like that it is easy to prepare on the day of the party since the mix is made a day ahead.  Just add the soda and mash a little!  I did alter the sugar... only 1 cup.

Unbelievably yummy! It is pretty quick and easy to make as long as you remember to make it ahead of time to make it slushy. It was gone almost immediately.

You can easily reduce the sugar by half and it is even better.  Or swap sugar for Splenda and use diet soda and sugar-free gelatin.   I really like peach gelatin and mango puree with lemon juice for brightness. (omit the OJ).

This is the best punch I have ever tasted! I noticed the recipe was for 50 servings, so I cut it in half because I had a small gathering. BIG MISTAKE! It lasted no time! I will use this punch for now on making full servings if not more! Thank you so much for this punch!

I made this for my sons birthday party and it was a huge hit! I got rave reviews from everyone! Actually, no one drank the other beverages we had available. I will definitely be making this again. My hubby suggested I use Ginger ale next time instead of lemon-lime soda. We'll see..I also liked the fact that I could make this days ahead.

Best Punch Ever!  Top it off with rum or vodka, even part of a frozen margarita - it's all good.

The "best" punch. Non-alcoholic or, use only 1cup of sugar and add strawberry, raspberry, or dragon fruit flavored rum to it for a refreshing cocktail. Easy and delicious!

Pretty yummy punch! Mine didn't really come out slushy even though it was frozen and slushy out of the freezer. Everyone thought it was good, and my husband even had it for breakfast.

OMG!! I made this for my moms 50th party. Its was sooo good. I only made 1 punch bowl and I wish I would have made more, it was the best punch I ever tasted. Every one loved it, it was gone in 30 min. I'm going to make more for my kids for a summer treat.

THis was great! I took it to a friend's baby shower & it was a HUGE SUCCESS! Everyone was asking for the recipe. The only change that I made was cutting the sugar down to 1 cup instead of 2.5 like previous posters had suggested. It was still sweet enough. This will be my "go to" punch recipe from now on. Thanks!

I agree with the other reviews that the sugar needs to be reduced. I also had trouble getting my punch to slush consistency. The frozen mixture was frozen solid, so it was just ice melting in soda.

I made the 50 servings- and had about 20 people and it was just the right amount.  Mine didnt freeze enough over night for some reason- but it was still perfect.  I used half of it with ginger ale and the other half with sprite.  I think the ginger ale was better- and I also used less sugar as was recommended by other people.  Turned out great- everyone loved it- and I will be surely making it again!

I made for the first time for Christmas Party. I filled the punch bowl up four times and it was empty before the nights end. I placed a bottle of chilled vodka and a bottle of Malibu rum next to the punch for the adults. This recipe was excellent with the additions too!!!

Amazing! Just as everyone else said and I also decreased sugar to 1 1/2cups as well, used ginger ale, took out of freezer 3 hrs before party and garnished with orange slices.  So many compliments and it was gone by the end of the party!!

I've made this for several holiday parties now, and it's always a big hit!  I would suggest freezing this overnight for the best effect.  It's excellent as is, but for those looking for an extra "kick," I add a splash of vodka.

HUGE hit at my party, however it was VERY sweet. I would reduce the sugar next time (and I love all things sweet). I still have the other half of the frozen punch...guess I need to throw another party? ;o)

I cut the sugar down to 1 C. & it was very sweet.  Also, followed others' directions to freeze it in gallon bags - this worked great.  I used ginger ale & it gave a great flavor - it disappeared at the baby shower I made it for!

Great punch.  Got a little sticky putting it in plastic bags, but is a great idea.  I was throwing a babyshower at the expecting parents' house, and it worked great to make ahead, put in a cooler, and was ready to go at shower time.

Ok I would completely give this a '10+'! It was AMAZING!!! Definitely the best punch I have ever had! I followed the recipe (except I only used half the sugar) and used Ginger Ale for the lime soda. It was such a good compliment to the other flavors and I got so many compliments. If you make this, everyone will love it and you will definitely not have any leftovers :)

This punch is awesome! I made this for a baby shower and made only one fatal mistake--I should have made more! Everyone was raving about it and the punch was nearly gone after only an hour. This was perfect because I could make it days ahead (which I did) and freeze it. Plus, since it was slushy, I didn't have to worry about an ice ring! Will definitely make this punch again.

This recipe was delicious! We made this for my girlfriend's shower and everyone loved it! It makes a lot, so we divided it and added about 1 1/2 cups of Bacardi rum to half of it.

This punch was PERFECT and made it as written.  I Almost reduced the amount of sugar based on other reviewers however; I am glad I stuck to the original recipe.  Yes, it is very sweet UNTIL you add the 2 liter of lemon lime soda.  I can see where one might think it was too sweet if they used sweetened pineapple juice...  I made this for two baby showers and a birthday party with rave reviews.  Nobody could stop talking about it and has been voted as the must have punch for all of our family celebrations.  I made the punch by myslef, stored it in two gallon sized, freezer bags with no issues or spills.  Thank you for sharing the recipe for this fabulous punch!

This is amazing punch! I made it for my baby shower the night before (froze it in 2 zip lock bags) and it was a hit! There wasn't any left over and so many people asked for the recipe. Some even mixed a little with their champange or white wine and said it was delicious! I took one of the frozen bags out 2 hours before and it worked perfectly. And then the second bag I took out at the same time but put it in the fridge to defrost. By the time the first one was gone (which didn't take very long) it was the perfect consistancey! I will definitely make again! Yummy! This is the first recipe I used on this site which ultimatly got me addicted! Lol! 
Thanks again!

This punch was perfect! I just did as the recipe requested - the only thing that i think I will do different next time is freeze the punch in ice cube trays rather than in a big block. But everyone loved it!!!

Great recipe.  I did 1 1/2 times the recipe for a bridal shower of about 25 people, and I didn't need the extra 1/2.  However, I did reduce the sugar and got did the following for 1 1/2 times the recipe.
Ingredients
1 3/4 cups white sugar 
9 cups water 
3 (3 ounce) packages strawberry flavored gelatin mix 
1-1/2 (46 fluid ounce) cans pineapple juice 
1 cup lemon juice 
6 cups orange juice 
3 (2 liter) bottles 7-Up

Absolutely yummy. I was short on time so I didn't boil the mixture and had a little stray gelatin, but I'm sure if I would have followed it it would have been perfect!

Awesome!! The only modification I would say is that you really need to take this out of the freezer a few hours before hand..or else it is very difficult to mash up. Thanks for this delicious recipe!!

LOVE this recipe!!! Turns out great every time I make it. Also, after a weekend of cocktail making with my friends, we poured in all our leftover alcohol into one of the batches and it tasted great. It was a bit of vodka, melon liqueur, and a bottle of Boone's Wine. Was very very yummy, couldn't taste the alcohol at all cause the punch has such a nice flavour.

I follow the recipe, but I make an "adult" version.  In a saucepan, I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 cups of water and strawberry jello.  Boil as directed.  I then add the other ingredients as directed but I add 2 cups of rum and 2 more cups of coconut rum. Freeze for at least 24 hourse.  I have never had any proplems with it over freezing; makes the perfect "slush" consistancy.  Instead of serving it with the lemon/lime carbonated beverage, I like to serve it with orange juice.  Fill your glass 3/4 of the way with the slush and the rest with OJ.  Mix and serve.  Great on a hot summer day.

I made this for a baby shower and have requests for it ever since!  I did use 1 cup of Splenda instead of sugar...I think the 2 1/2 cups would have been too sweet.  The second time I made it I used Cherry jello instead strawberry due to allergies.  Still tasted good, though not as sweet.

Made this for a baby shower - and it was devoured! Cut back the sugar to 2 cups, used fresh lemon juice and substituted ginger ale. It was great! Took other reviewer's suggestions and used freezer zip locks - taking one out 2 hours beforehand, and leaving one in the fridge. Punch was great, although I think I let the 1st bag defrost too long at room temp, because the slushyness of the 2nd bag coming from the fridge was much better!

Way too sweet for me and I only put in 1 cup of sugar. Maybe just needs to be omited seeing the jello would be sweet enough. Had to put more gingerale in to dilute it.

This has become a favorite. "You're going to make that Great Slushy punch again aren't you?" Everyone asks for it and asks for the recipe.  It does require a little bit of planning,  but what doesn't and it is SOOOO worth the effort (which is minimal).

Wow! I made this the day ahead and froze it in two large gallon size ziploc bags (doubled for leak protection). It was a little hard to get in the bags but worth the effort. Then I froze overnight and served the next day for Christmas, adding the lemon-lime soda. Every drop was gone! Very yummy. I did add a little more lemon-lime soda to keep it from being too slushy. My son has already requested this again for a party with friends. Thank you for the recipe!

This punch is very good. Everyone raved about this punch at my Christmas office party this week, and had several people ask me for the recipe. I only gave it four stars, however, as it was way too sweet, even cutting the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups (like other reviewers recommended). I will still be making this for my next party, but next time I will cut the sugar down even more (to 1/2 cup) and maybe use Club Soda instead of Seven-Up or Sprite(which doesn't have added sugar). Thanks to the reviewers who shared their tips in how to transport the punch. It worked great to pour the punch into ziploc bags. This way I was able to make the punch ahead and put them in a cooler.  When I got to the party, I poured soda over one bag of punch and it was ready to serve. Note, however, that to have it melt more quickly, make sure to lay the ziploc bags down horizontally in the freezer (I put them in and it took longer to melt as it was a thicker layer).

I made this punch during a family buffet I hosted. Everyone loved it and were asking for the recipe. It was the best punch ever. From reading the other reviews I cut the sugar in the recipe by half. I also used sprite instead of the lemonade. And just for fun, I cut out some fruits (melon, apple and grapes)and put them in a long toothpick. I then placed a toothpick in each glass before filling it up with the punch. It was great! The punch was the highlight of the buffet and every one kept asking for more.  Will surely make this on every dinner I host again.

This recipe was great to make ahead for a party.  It was VERY GOOD too!  I didn't have the flavors of jello called for so I substituted peach and raspberry flavors.  This turned out to be a hit.  The only bad thing was that the bees really liked, so if u are going to have this at an outside gathering keep that in mind.  This was definetely the best punch I have ever had and will definetely make it again.  YUM!

I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it. You have to let this cool for about 1 hour before freezing it. I altered the jello part, I used a few different kinds of berry & black cherry it was very good. I froze into 3 quart size bags it was perfect for one punch bowl. The frozen part was small enough to fit in the bowl nicely and it melted perfectly. I also took out of the freezer at least 1 hour before serving.

Pretty tasty! I didn't leave enough time for my ingredients to completely freeze, but it was good anyway. Strawberry jello makes a really pretty deep coral punch.

This is FANTASTIC! Both kids and adults love it! I've made it with strawberry jello, and Berry Blue (which turns green), and lime. All of them were fantastic.!! Thanks for sharing!

This goes FAST! I did make changes: reduced sugar to 1-3/4 cups and used ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda. It was delicious. Gallon zip lock bags are so convenient: 7 cups of punch in ea. and freeze on a cookie tray.

Awesome punch!!  I made this for a retirement party recently and people absolutely raved over the punch.  I had tons of requests for the recipe.  So many people said it was the best punch they've EVER had.  I used the full amount of sugar and froze the mixture in gallon-sized ziplock bags, as suggested.  Another tip I can add is to use a hand mixer to stir the frozen mixture with the 7-Up.  That made it so much easier for me to get it thoroughly stirred and into the slushy consistency.  I have requests now to bring this to several upcoming events.  This punch is a nice change from the kind that uses sherbet.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe saved me!!!  I made another recipe similar to this one and it didn't turn slushy, it was jelloey.  Luckily I made it a day before I needed it so I had a chance to do something else.  This one turned out perfect.  I halved the recipe, used cherry jello (cause that is what I had) and switched amounts of pineapple and orange juice because I didn't have enough pineapple juice because of the previous failed recipe.  I don't know if I would have liked it any better the other way around.  This will definatly be added to my favorite recipes!

Very Good!  I did reduce the sugar, though.  Everyone at the party loved it.  Too bad I'm off carbonation or I would have had more.  Just a sip was enough for me to love it! Thanks.

This is a fantastic recipe. Everyone loved it. I could not get all of the lemon-lime soda in my punch bowl so I added as much as I could. It was still wonderful.

Made this punch for a Christmas gathering of 14 people.  Everyone loved the punch and drank every drop.  I did decrease the amount of sugar to 1 3/4 cups after reading the reviews.  I will definitely make this punch again.  Making it ahead was a real plus.  I made the punch 2 days before the gathering.

I just made this for my 10 yr old sons birthday. It was a great hit! All the boys loved it. I would definately make this again. I only served 1/2. The other 1/2 is still in my freezer for another day. I would suggest putting it in the blender for a second or 2 to help break it up a bit.

I made this and put the punch into ice cube trays like an earlier reviewer suggested and we love it. I ended up using 10 ice trays. To make it slushy faster I put a few cubes in a cup, add a little sprite then use my hand blender to break up the cubes and add the rest of the soda. The boys love it extra slushy! Great recipe!

Excellent! My friend insisted on using ginger ale instead of lemon/lime soda. Not that it was a bad idea, not at all. I like to try recipes as they are written though. It kept itself cold without watering down and the flavor was great. People kept on asking me what was on it. It was very refreshing and not too sweet. I'm keeping this one.

Everyone loved this punch! I substituted 1 box of mixed fruit jello for the strawberry. I also used a bottle of cranberry ginger ale as a subsitute for one bottle of lemon-lime soda.  Only complaint was from my dieters who were avoiding sugar. I wonder if this would work as well w/sugar free jello and diet soda? (probably would still need the sugar to make the slushy part).
(This punch also tasted good with a little vanilla vodka added to the cup!)

This punch was yummy. It was a big hit at our party. My hubby ought the ingredients and instead of getting frozen pineapple juice, he got a large can of chopped pineapples. I put them in a food processor and added them. I thouht it was great because it added texture(bits of pineapple)

I didn't give this enough time to freeze, it was real cold tho and I didn't add ice cubes.  It was fantastic!  I'll make this often and its so easy to make in advance and keep frozen - makes lots, and its a good thing, it goes fast.

Because I have a small punch bowl and I only made this at noon for a party in the evening, I divided the mixture into 4 freezer bags.  It was just about right at party time, but would definitely need to sit out awhile if it had been frozen longer.  Everyone loved it and came back for more.  Quick, easy, inexpensive, and DELICIOUS!  This is a keeper!!!

My 4 year old niece said this tasted like bubble gum, my nine year old nephew said candy. I thought it was excellent, and will definitely make it again. I love the different taste, and the slushy texture. Thanks to other reviewers, I also found cooling it for an hour and putting it in a gallon ziploc bag was perfect.

I made this for the kids at New Years but the adults got into it and started adding an ounce of vodka to their glass. It was a hit all around thats for sure, although you need to take it out really early and attempt to break it up during the next few hours it does not turn into slush that easy.

BEST PUNCH EVER! I used the blue raspberry jello so it would match my son's themed birthday party and it was a HUGE hit with both the adults and kids.
On a side note, there was some leftover after the party so us adults mixed it with Malibu Rum and it was out of this world!! ;)

I too cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup. I also added sherbet when I put it in the punch bowl. Helped keep it cold and slushy.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner as an alternative to soda.  I made 1/2 of the recipe 2 days in advance significantly reducing the amount of sugar.  I poured the punch into a gallon zip-loc baggie and placed it in the freezer. Thanksgiving morning, I put the frozen punch in the refrigerator to thaw into a semi-hard slush.  Before serving, I poured the slushy punch mixture into the punch bowl and added the chilled soda with orange slices for garnish. My DIL and I also added Moscato to our glasses of punch for an alcoholic beverage. I would make this punch again; great recipe!

Fabulous! Made it with 1 box sugar-free Jello, 3 c. water, 1/2 c. Sugar (which could be left out entirely), pineapple juice, oj,  & lemon juice. Poured into 2 - 1 gallons and froze overnight. Next morning it wasn't even slushy. I kept in freezer & placed chilled 2 liter Diet Sprite in freezer at 10:00am. Took both out at 2:00. Upon pouring super-chilled Sprite (which wasn't frozen) into super-chilled punch mix - it made a fabulous slushy punch!   Delicious!!

I made this punch for a progressive neighborhood dinner just before Christmas.  I didn't use quite as much sugar- maybe cut it by 1/3- but it was just delicious.  I put a bottle of rum out so people could spike or not spike according to their own liking, and not a drop of punch was leftover. Almost all the rum was left. It makes a LOT of punch, but that was a good thing! It was the kind of punch that keeps calling you back to the punch bowl and you know it's great, but you just can't guess all the ingredients. Thanks for sharing this wonderful punch, Valerie. I can't wait for another "occasion" so I can try another favorite flavor of jello and juice!

Thank you Valerie Lynne, for a truly luscious punch! I did cut the sugar in half after reading other reviews and it was sweet enough for us. I also used ziploc freezer bags, laid flat to freeze. They were just right the next afternoon. I took it to a luncheon and put it together in a drink dispenser, just like Cookin' Mommy's photo. Next time, I might try my immersion blender to combine the slush and pop. There were many compliments about this punch.

This punch was definitely a hit!  I froze the mix in 2 Ziploc bags.  The first bag I took out 2 hours before the party and it was still a rock!  When adding the sprite, it broke up a little but I still had massive chunks to break up with a knife.  I made this for my teenage daughter's birthday party.  It was going fast, so I quickly microwaved the 2nd Ziploc bag.  After 1 minute in the microwave and some kneading of the bag - it was perfectly slushy!  Will save the 2 hour defrost time next time and just microwave!

I made this for our annual family Christmas Eve Dinner Buffet.  Everyone loved it!  The only change I will make next time is using quart sized ziplock bags instead of a gallon size.  I have a 4qt punch bowl and the gallon size bag of punch didn't fit.  I had to let if defrost and then chop it up so it would fit in the bowl.  If you have a smaller punch bowl use smaller bags to freeze in.  Great punch!!  I will make this again and again!

This is the best punch EVER.  I use it for every holiday, event, you name it.  Like others, the only adjustment I have made is to use only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, everything else remains the same.  I also freeze it in round quart containers, it then fits perfectly into my punch bowl.

Having NEVER made punch before, I landed on this recipe because the instructional video was very helpful, and I loved the color. Made it, and froze it a couple of weeks ago; just served it last night for an evening pre-event reception (only 45 minutes) at our daughter's school.  Only used HALF the sugar (1 1/4 cup), and froze it in 4 one gallon bags (instead of 2 separate containers) - (our punch bowl was on the smaller side). So with four "slushy punch ice starter blocks" and 2, two liter bottles of 7 UP, we made it in two punch bowls - so we could serve glasses from the kitchen bowl onto trays for our volunteer students to pass around - we ended up adding 22 extra CANS of SPRITE (only because it was available at the school during the reception) over the constantly melting blocks over the 45 minutes and it made plenty for about 100 or more 1/2 cup servings (we truly lost count).  We called it SLUSHY FALL PUNCH, and people could not get enough of it!!  It matched our fall themed decorations beautifully - the red ice block turns a slightly orangish grapefruit color when the lemon lime soda is poured over it and it starts melting.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!  What a blessing!  LAST TIP:  take out and pour one of the soda bottles on at least one ice block 25 minutes before you need to serve it.  Microwave the blocks if they are still too frozen and you need them to be a bit more quickly melted as the crowd keeps clamoring for more of the delicious punch!!

I just made this wonderful punch for a function this past weekend and was delighted with the results.
As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, used Ziplock bags, froze it in a thin layer, froze it for one night only, and used part Club Soda and part Lemon-Lime soda. It was an enormous success and many guests lined up for seconds, thirds and fourths! NO it's not "health food" (duh?!) but it IS a delicious and wonderful treat. THANK YOU VALERIE for submitting this recipe.

EZ! Good base recipe.  Use whatever jello you have on hand.  I omit sugar entirely.   Dissolve jello in just enough hot water - add cold water / ice to make 6C.   This lets it freeze faster - cuts down on your "ahead" time.   Wonderful to have in the freezer for the opportune moment.  Nice to have the tradition of punch added back into our events and it is fun to get to use a punch bowl - it just looks festive!!  Friends expect punch to be our contribution!  It can be separated into Quart sized freezer bags - adjust ginger ale amt - serve in a large salad bowl w/ a gravy ladle.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Well I made this recipe for our Junior Canadian Ranger patrol Christmas party last night. We invited out their families and ended up with over 65 people for a pot luck and I must say, the punch was a HUGE hit with kids, teens, parents and grandparents. I have multiple requests for the recipe that I am back on here to print off for them. I went with the 1 cup of sugar and used the sugar-free jello as well as I thought there should be plenty of sugar in the various juices and the pop. I, myself, got to have 1 cup and I really enjoyed it (that's all I got in the end between the serving, speeches and presentations). I did stretch it out by diluting it with more than  2 litre per gallon as they were going through it too fast....lol! Nobody noticed ;)   Thank you for a great recipe

I made this punch for Thanksgiving!  It was a hit!  I only used 1 CUP OF SUGAR as some of the other persons suggested.  It was so good that I kept 1/2 of portion for myself and took it back home with me!  I cannot wait to have my friends over the just add the 7UP.  Also if you can find lemons around this time that are inexpensive, they are better than the lemon juice in the bottle.  Very yummy punch!  BUT RECIPE LOVERS BEWARE! For some of us that have vegetarians in our family, let them know that it was made from Jell-o, which is an animal protien.  the next time I make it for my vegetarian friends I may go searching for an Jello- alternative.

Love this drink. The only thing we changed was we only used 1 1/4 c . sugar and 1 bottle of Sprite. I was afraid 2 bottles would water it down too much. Tastes delicious and received great reviews from family and friends...thanks you!

We used this recipe for my grandmas 80th birthday and everybody LOVED IT! It had a wonderful fruity and citrus flavor to it. The bubble was also wonderful!  I will tell you however that it really needs to thaw a little bit unless you want to sit there and hack it into bits with a knife in the kitchen like we did! LOL Other than the lack of good timing on my part it was WONDERFUL and very easy to make! You can make it way ahead of time or the night before! Great way to get a jump on things!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I served this at a bridal shower this weekend and it was a HUGE hit!  I did take others advice and cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups, and I think it would have been just as good with only 1 cup.  We had to double the recipe because people loved it so!  Thanks again!

This is a no fail punch. I made the frozen mix and stored it in two bowls, but forgot to add both to the punch bowl, and it was still really good. A lighter version if you want it not so sweet. I'd use 3 2-liter bottles of sprite is using all the frozen mix, it is pretty sweet.

I made this punch and followed the reviewers before me and used just 1 cup of sugar.  Everyone loved it !   I would say to definately use zip lock bags only because I used a store version and it took a little bit to make sure I had the grooves right and it was truly sealed.  The zip lock I could have slid and been sure it was sealed first time.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a great recipe. I made 6 large flower ice cubes  using a shaped silicon muffin/cupcake pan and put them in the beverage container to keep the punch cold. It was so tasty and the hit of the party!

Absolutely wonderful!  I used this recipe in late July '10 for a catering with primarily 25 adults and 5 children.  It was a big hit.  I used a square Tupperware container as opposed to a plastic bottle for easier dispensing because I wanted it icy in the punch bowl.  (We tempered it for 1/2 hour before scooping it out).

I served this for my daughter's baptism back in March.  All the guests LOVED IT!  I made it exactly as written.  The punch bowl was drained early.  I needed to make a blue punch for my sons pool birthday party.  So I changed the strawberry jello to berry blue.  I floated a mini beach ball on the top...it was adorable and a HUGE hit!

This punch was an absolute hit at my 7 year old daughter's luau party.  The girls kept coming back for more and raving over the yumminess.  I made it according to the recipe, except for cutting sugar down to 1 cup and using a grapefruit soda instead of lemon-lime.  I had moms emailing me that their daughters thought the punch was the highlight of the party!  Can't wait to make it again!

No kidding when they say not a drop left! I just made this for my sister's bridal shower and the ladies were scrapping the bottom of the punch bowl for more! I used one cup of sugar instead of two and used raspberry gelatin instead of strawberry. Delish, thanks so much for the recipe.

Made this for our staff party.  Phenomenal with rum or vodka for an extra kick.  Phenomenal as non-alcoholic punch.

Before trying this punch recipe I tried another one in the top 20. The other one was kind of bitter and wouldn't appeal to the taste buds of the kids/teens/young adults at the church social. So on the morning of the event, I quickly whipped up this concoction and placed in freezer bags and put them in the freezer.  This one is so much better mainly because of the orange juice. I used strawberry, raspberry and cherry gelatin mix. I accidentally pick up sugar free strawberry mix but it still tasted great! I omitted the lemon juice and reduced the sugar and it was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it.   Me and another girl were in charge of drinks and her supplies ran out within an hour. I guess she thought that eight  2-liter sodas would quench the thirst of 40 people for 4 hours. Boy, was she wrong! So I brought out my bags of slush and ginger ale and everyone loved it!   I can't wait to try this recipe with more gelatin flavors!

Easily the best punch I've ever had! I don't usually make punch, so I was kind of nervous. But it was pretty easy and came out perfectly. The slush is perfect for a hot summer day.

I made this for a bridal shower and it was perfect. I put it in two freezer bags, froze them over night and took them out about 2 hours before the shower, the first bag did not slush very well, but the second bag did after being out on a counter for about 3 hours. Next time I'll just take it out sooner. But so easy and delicious! Thanks

I made this for a Doctors Retirement party for 20 last October. I only made a half a batch which they finished in 20 minutes! I had to run back to the kitchen & mix up another batch which I had to blend pineapple juice with crushed ice tossed in some OJ & cranberry than topped it with 2 12oz bottles of Mountain Dew I got out of the vending maching. LOL! They still couldn't get enough of it! It has been the number one request for all office parties that I cater for our company ever since.  MAKE EXTRA.....they will drink it!!!

I made this at my sons 2nd bday party and it turned out great. I used less sugar as others suggested but otherwise followed exactly. As for the "slush" part, I took the frozen contents out of the freezer about 3 hours before the party. The first batch wasn't slushy at all, as it took a while for the pouch to melt with the soda. The second batch was perfectly slushy by the time I took it from the fridge and put it into the punch bowl. Next time I'll take the juice pouches out of the freezer 4-5 hours before I'm ready to mix and serve. Nonetheless, great punch.

This punch is amazing and my entire family loved it at Christmas Eve.   I used raspberry gelatin instead of strawberry and floated frozen orange slices and raspberries in it. I also spiked mine individually with almond champagne (Wilson Creek Winery) and it was delicious!   I froze the mix in four equal parts in freezer bags and thawed them in the fridge all day before adding the soda. It stayed fresh and cold in my punch bowl.

Everyone loved it at the party.  I am planning on making it for Christmas Eve.  Be careful to let the frozen part thaw for a bit before the guests arive.  Citrus Drop is also a good substitution for the soda needed in this recipe.

Made this for a cookie exchange party and as the others mentioned, it was a hit.  Cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  We kept it a virgin punch, but had a bottle of Absolute Mandarin on the side for those who wanted it spiked, and it was great.  Would definitely make it again.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, I made this for a christmas party last night, and like another reviewer experienced, there was not a drop left.  Everyone raved about it.  I also took the suggestion of other reviewers and used only 1 cup of sugar.  I also added about 2 cups of rum for each bowl (recipe makes 2 bowls) when I added the Sprite, this seemed to be the perfect amount for my guests tastes.  I started with 1/2 cup and kept adding more as several of us tasted it.  What I also like is that you don't have to keep it on ice, because it is already a bit slushy and keeps nice and cold on its own!

Fabulous!  Had 15 people for Thanksgiving and we went through both bags of punch!!  People who usually go for the beer went for this punch instead!  I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar, and used ginger ale instead of lemon lime. Very very good!

This was a hit!  Made it for a party and had nothing left!! It never got slushy for me.  The frozen mixture just melted like a huge ice cube.  Once it was melted and stirred together it was great.  I followed the other comments and suggestions and used less sugar than the recipe called for and it was still very sweet!

This was great.  I used peach jello because I wanted an orange color punch for a shower.  Also, I used 1.5 cups of sugar and that was perfect.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made the punch the night before the shower.  It definitely needs more time in the freezer than just the night before.  Mine wasn't very slushy but it still tasted great!

This tastes wonderful!  However, we had quite a bit left - and we had a pretty big party.  I suggest making half if you are having 10-15 people.

Made this for my sister's bridal shower. Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe! I also froze in ziploc bags which I placed inside a 2cup measuring cup to hold bags upright while I filled them.  Can't wait for the summer party to make it again!

Here are some tips I hope you find useful...putting it into bags seemed too messy for 1 person, so instead I used the Ziploc reusable containers, since they are marked by the cup.  That way, I could mix up half, then add the other half and know just how much mix to pop ratio.  The mix makes exactly 17 cups.  It also helps it freeze faster-I made it at 11AM, mixed it together at 6PM and it was perfect consistency.  Also, I used raspberry and lime jello, full sugar, and make sure you use unsweetened pineapple juice, and it definitely is not too sweet-and I prefer tart over sweet!  Very good punch, much better than adding sherbet.

Very good. Wish I'd frozen the mixture in shallow containers in order to mix it with the soda. Update: single batch fills two one-gallon-size ziploc bags. Froze flat and broke into big pieces - much easier to mix with soda (used potato masher). I'm glad to have a half batch left in the freezer for an impromptu party.

This punch is delicious!  The first time I made it, I used all of the sugar and it was too sweet.  Now, I only use 1 cup of sugar and it is perfect.

I made this for a baby shower and what a hit! Everyone loved it! DEFROST in the microwave a little before pouring in the soda my fist batch wasn't slushy enough. I can't wait to make it again. Oh, and 1 cup sugar is more than enough.

Made this one at a party and EVERYONE wanted the recipe! I did it exactly as is and thought it was the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. Just be sure to plan ahead with this one so you have time for the freezing process!

I used this punch for my daughter's 16th birthday party.  It was a great success! I did cut the amount of sugar originally called for down to 1 cup and it was not missed.  Otherwise, great recipe!

I've made this twice for showers and everyone goes crazy over this icy Hawaiian-style punch.  Very easy to make and for those vegetarians out there - don't be scared to substitute agar and strawberry kool-aid for the gelatin.  Tried it once with gelatin and once with agar.  Doesn't change the taste or consistency.

This is a great punch recipe. I never have any left when I make it. You technically don't have to freeze it (just cool it), but it's a heck of a lot better if it's a slush. Plus, someone always ends up sneaking in some kind of alcohol, which is just fine with me.

I tried this recipe for a Christmas Eve gathering and most everyone loved it. A couple people that said it was too sweet, even though I followed the suggestions of others and used 1cup of sugar. I also used raspberry jello and the flavor was wonderful.  It was very festive looking and a great alternative for those non-alcohol people. I think next time I will try it with even less sugar and see how that goes. I will definetly try it again, thanks for all the suggestions from everyone, it helps a lot when you're trying something new and don't have time to try again if it flops!

I made this for our Christmas party last Saturday night and it was a HUGE hit! I renamed it "Reindeer Punch" for the occassion. I had vodka & rum on hand for those that wanted a little zip which made everyone happy. I think this punch would be great for any occassion.

This punch is outstanding--light, refreshing. I cut back the sweetness a bit, using about half the sugar and it was better, we thought. I like it best with Cranberry Splash Sierra Mist soda. We also liked it with a little more of the soda in it. I also made a batch with sugar-free jello, Splenda, light fruit juices and diet Cranberry Sierra Mist. Absolutely wonderful.

I have given this recipe (with a few minor adjustments) to a few people and it remains a party favorite. The best thing about this punch is that you CAN'T really mess this one up. The recipe only gets better with your own personal "tweeks" it is never bad. OK, first, only use 1 cup of sugar, second, use whatever jello you have on hand (raspberry really is terrific, though), last, if you want to try something different from ginger ale, go ahead. I prefer grapefruit, but cranberry ginger ale, diet, or orange might be nice depending on your tastes.

This is the best punch I have ever had! It is SUPERB!!! The only change I made, was that I had to substitute the lemon juice for lime juice b/c I was out of lemon. Either way, it was awesome! I made it for a baby shower & 12 ladies knocked off 2 punch bowls full! Everyone wanted the recipe! Try it!!!

Made this for a farewell party with one cup of sugar, not 2 1/2 c.  Used gallon Ziploc bags (as suggested) and took them out of the freezer two hours before serving.  HUGE success!  Thanks!

Big hit and alot easier then I though it would be to make. I read in a magazine once when you freeze punch to put it in a bunt pan. Then when you have one half of the punch out for serving you can add the one from the bunt pan and it keeps it cold while looking interesting. I served this at my sons second birthday party and it was a success with the adults and kids. Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely the best punch recipe.  Everyone asks for the recipe and there are never any leftovers.  The only change I've made is to use Canada Dry rather than lemon lime soda, this makes it a little less sweet.

One and 1/2 cups of sugar is perfect.  I followed the recipe to the "T" (besides the sugar).  I spiked it with a cup of Everclear, and it went fast, and went well.  A+++ 10 stars if I could!  Next weekend, my friend asked me to make it again for his party!

This was a tasty punch, but we had a tough time turning it into slush.  We froze the punch in two freezer bags as folks suggested, but since we don't have a big punch bowl, the "bricks" were hard to get into our bowl and mash up.  If I made it again I would freeze it in four smaller freezer bags to make it easier.  I would also recommend taking them out of the freezer in advance or thawing them in the microwave for a minute or two.

This punch was truly wonderful! I am craving it even as I write this review. I made it for one of my childrens parties...kids and adults both loved it.  I cut down on the sugar to 2 cups.  I could have cut it down a bit more, but since it was for kids I am glad I didn't.  Rest assured if you make this punch it will be a huge hit!

This is by far the best punch I've ever tasted. I made it for a cookie exchange and it was all gone. I too cut down on the sugar and it was perfect. I think the reason this punch is so refreshing is that there's no sherbet to make it creamy like other punches. It is sooooo good, and I dont normally like punch. I'll be making this again tomorrow for Xmas!

Wonderful punch...but for those who said to cut the sugar down I think they were using lemonaid and not lemon juice...I would advise if you use lemon juice to use the reccomended sugar or it will be quite sour.  Was wonderful tasting!

Don't be scared off by any negative reviews.  This is absolutely the best punch ever.  I have traded in my old recipe for this one!  I have taken this punch to 5 huge gatherings and almost everyone has requested the recipe. I am now the offical punch person.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!!!

Made this slush for a Christmas party, It was quite good, a little to much pineapple was in it, but it stayed in slush form for a long time, everyone had a drink of it and none was left over as well. probably will make it agian. i also took the first bag out an hour before the party and the second bag half an hour before the party, then i added the pop.

Yummy punch!!  Everyone loved it.  It sayed slushy all night and I just kept adding soda to it.  

I used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of the full amount and also used orange/peach/mango juice instead of plain OJ.  

Highly recommend this simple punch to anyone having a party!

Made this for anniversary dinner party.  Dh and I squabbled because he wanted soda and I wanted this.  We made 5 1 gal bags and had one left over at the end of the evening :) 

As for the soda, we bought 70 cans and I noticed only 5 cans were missing the next morning.  Everyone loved it and I still make my own version (see previous review). Make this punch you won't be sorry.

This was a huge hit at my son's birthday party! The flavors were great (and so easy to put together the day of as I had frozen the "slush" the week before). The adults liked it "spiked" with Malibu rum. Definitely a great recipe for adults and kids alike!

This recipe makes a large volume of punch!  It was well received at a baby shower I hosted.  My husband loved it as well.  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it did not turn out slushy, but it was still good.

This was delicious - I made it at my recent BBQ and it was gone in no time.  Used cherry gelatin - I figure you could use most flavors and it would be just as good.

LOVED this punch.  We had it at a pot luck baby shower at the office and it was a hit.  I cut the recipe in half for a group of about 30 and it filled about 2/3 of my large crystal punch bowl.  Next time, I would probably cut down on the sugar.

Make sure to set the slush out early enough (at least a half hour before). I did mine in 2 freezer bags and it worked perfectly! Delicious!!

This is fantastic.  I've made it several times now and keep a batch split in my freezer - the extended family requests it.  Perfect especially for hot weather gatherings!

This was a hit!  Both adults & kids at my daughter's 6th b-day party couldn't get enough. It has great flavor & we loved the slush, however, I will reduce the sugar next time.  I used Sierra Mist soda and it was a little sweet.

I made this for a baby shower.  Since it was a small shower (20 guests) and my first attempt at punch, I wasn't expecting much and brought plenty of "back up" drinks.  This was gone in an instant, and the other drinks were hardly touched.  I wish I would have made more.  Highly recommended.

I made this at Christmas for my family and THEY LOVED IT! I have a small family so I cut the recipe in half and it still filled an average size punch bowl. I think i also added more soda than what the recipe calls for...instead of one 2 liter bottle (because im working with half a recipe) i added 1.5 - 1.75 liters so it was a little more diluted than what the full recipe calls for and it was still delicious!!!

I made the recipe exactly according to the directions, and it was great! I got tons of compliments....I agree, you could probably cut back on the sugar a little, but I didn't think it was too sweet.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Everyone at my toddler's b-day party loved this.  I used less sugar as suggested and the only thing I will do different next time is break the frozen juice up into smaller chunks so that it doesn't take as long to blend with the sprite.

Absolutely AWESOME!!!! Like others, I cut back the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, which was still a little too sweet, but it disappeared so quickly that I'll be making this for every get-together from now on! I really like that it can be made days or a week ahead of time and is very simple to prepare.

i LOVE punch, but its a rare occassion that it is ever served anymore. I made this recipe and froze it into ice cubes, into small (former) butter tubs, etc.  This made ALOT of single servings, i would cut down the recipe next time...but its awesome to throw a few of the cubes in glass and add the 7-up.  It actually seems to form a "froth" on the top that my 7 year old son just loved!

This is the best punch recipe I have ever had. I also used ginger ale since I like it better. I made the 2 punch bowls for a church luncheon and they were both gone in 10 minutes. My kids want me to make it and have it on hand in the freezer all the time now. And it stayed slushy the whole time. Yummy.

Made this for Christmas Eve party last night and it was fabulous!  Used cherry jello and ginger ale. Let the frozen punch sit out about 1hr before serving to soften.  Just like a slurpee- excellent recipe and will be making again!

This is terrific!  I love the fact that you make the "mix" ahead of time and then just thaw it until it's slushy.  I did cut down the sugar, to about 1 1/4 cups and got many compliments!  I'd be interested in trying it with some different Jello flavors as well!

I served this at a baby shower and while it was enjoyed by all, everyone kept asking for water because the punch was so sweet.  I cut back the sugar to 2 cups, and part of that was Splenda because I ran out of sugar, so I can't imagine making it with the full 2 1/2 cups.  I also must have let it thaw too long because the punch wasn't particularly slushy; I had large chunks in the punch bowl that I tried to break up with a potato masher, but once they were gone, there was no slushy consistency.  I liked the flavor very much, but if I make it again, I'll cut back further on the sugar and/or maybe use sugar-free jello.

Nice flavour, but way too sweet. I will leave out the sugar next time. I've had punches before with fruit, like strawberries and crushed pineapple. I think I will add them in next time.

So far it's the best Punch I've ever served. All my friends loved it. The taste and the name! And it costs less than $10 for 50 people... such a great deal. I love it!  :)

WOW!! I made this last week just for my husband and I! I did something different. When you split the two contents I put one in the freezer and the other in the fridge. Then, once the freezer juice was slushy I put one soda in it and we drank it just like that. Then about 5 days later when we ran out of that juice I had the other container in the fridge and did the same thing! It is meant for crowds but we both loved serving it just for us and immediate family. Everyone swore I had alcohol in it... they couldn't believe it was just the regular ingredients! LOVED THIS!

This was a hit at my luau. I used cherry 7up
to add a little more fruit flavor. I think I'll
try adding some fresh lime juice next time. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed the directions given.  It is awesome.  Someone said it sounded like a lot of work.  I found it easy and required very little time and effort.  If anyone is interest I measured my liquid between the gallon size ziplock bags and it is 9 cups ( maybe slightly more) per bag.  Hope that helps.

Thank you so much for this recipe. Everyone that tastes it loves it! I do a lot of entertaining,  so it is great that it can be made weeks before an event. I took the advice of others and cut the sugar back  to about 1 3/4 -2 cups. I also change the juices and jell-o flavours once in a while because I like experimenting with recipes. For a wedding , just by adjusting the jell-o flavour, you can coordinate the punch with the colour theme of the wedding.The original recipe is excellent just as it is but it's easy to tweak to your own taste if you like. THIS IS THE PERFECT PUNCH RECIPE!

this punch is great.  I used 1 cup sugar since I don't like sweet drinks, and added sparkling lemon flavored water instead of 7Up.  With a bit of vodka, it was perfection.

Tried this recipe yesterday for my son's first communion party. I wish I had doubled the batch. I am glad I read some of the reviews and I tried it with just the one cup of sugar. It tasted great.  What was perfect was  that the kids loved it and kept coming back for more and the adults would take some and then go put a shot of rm or vodka in it. It was so refreshing!  I will keep this handy and make it again.

I have made one like this but instead of sugar used sherbet, pineapple, lemon and lime. Vodka one time, champagne another, you have to tell you guest about the alcohol because it is so good they drink it up!

Way, Way, Way too sweet.  The texture is amazing!  It has a wonderful slushy consistency, but it is nauseatingly sweet.  People only took a couple of sips and we had half filled cups everywhere. If I make it again I will leave out the 2.5 cups of sugar since every ingredient except the lemon juice is already sweet.

This was a Hit! I omitted the high fructose corn syrup with the lemon lime soda and used soda water instead. I increased the sugar by about one cup or to taste to compensate. This would be perfect with champagne.

I wanted to try something different from my usual punch.  If I make it again, I will probably only use 2 cups of sugar.  I still like my other recipe better.  Thank you!

Everyone loves this punch! I have used different kinds of jello to fit specific events (blue or pink for a baby shower, etc.). Always cut the sugar in half though.

Loved this.  But kids weren't wild about the pineapple taste.  So, I divided the pineapple juice amount into 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 sprite with the 2 2-litre bottles both ginger ale. The kids and their friends love it.  I still find it a bit sweet (even with the sugar cut to 1 cup).  I think the next time I try it I will get rid of the sugar completely and maybe even replace some of the sprite with apple juice.  I have served this both slushy (frozen first), and just refrigerated - I'm not wild about a slushy punch and just wanted it as a drink.

I have made this numerous times, and it's a huge hit every time! And 
I love the face that you get two batches out of one recipe, each in its own ziplock bag. It's delicious!

Amazing! All my guests loved it (used only 1 cup of sugar & sweet enough). Made it for 3 different events & wish I would have made 2 batches for a 50th birthday party....punch was gone before dinner was served.

This recipe was great. I made it for my bridal shower this past weekend and everyone loved it! The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup of sugar rather than the full amount listed. I think it would have been way to sweet otherwise (hence the 4 stars rather than 5 stars). I was already asked for the recipe by a couple of people. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this punch for my daughter's first birthday party and needless to say it was fan-freaking-tasic! I read many reviews and decided to go with 1 cup of sugar. I also divided into two 1 gallon ziplock bags as suggested. I had a large enough drink dispenser to hold both batches together, I also had champagne on the side for whomever wanted that extra kick. I received nothing but complements and there wasn't a drop left by the end of the party. I will definitely make it again.

I read a ton of reviews before I made this recipe so I decreased the sugar from 2 1\2 cups to 1 cup and it was fantastic!  I will make this recipe for every birthday party and get together until the end of time! Thanks so much for sharing!

We really enjoyed this at Thanksgiving this year.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup as other reviewers suggested.  I think I would up it to 1 1/2 cups though, just for a little extra sugar.  It is definitely easy to have in the freezer and pull out to defrost for a bit before adding the Sprite, or whatever you decide to use.  I froze mine in 4 quart size bags so that I could have smaller batches if needed.

This was excellent (we took advice from other comments and only used 1 cup of sugar... anything more and it would have been too sweet!)! Made for a party my husband and I hosted and we got many rave reviews for it. One batch (the recipe includes two batches) was perfect for the 20 people we had, and we still have some saved for an upcoming event!

This punch is AMAZING! I am known for this punch and have made it for baby showers, bridal showers, BBQs, birthday parties, work potlucks, and even a wedding (with 140 guests). I am always asked for the recipe. It does take some prepping with freezing the jello oj/pineapple mix but it lasts in your freezer leaving you with an incredibly tasty and refreshing punch the day of the party. I use ziploc gallon bags to store in the freezer and when it is time to serve the punch, I simply drop in the frozen goodness and pour in my bottles of soda.  A potato masher is really helpful when breaking up the frozen block. I have yet to meet someone who didn't LOVE this.

I made this recipe for a baby shower this weekend.  The overall consensus was it was way too sweet even though I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and used soda water in place of the lemon lime soda. If I made this again, I think i would omit the sugar all together.

I liked the taste of this punch, but I found it way harder to make than I was expecting!  First of all, even though I tried to stir occasionally while waiting for the Jello/water/sugar mixture to come to a boil, it ended up sticking to the bottom of my pan and starting to brown.  I tried to rub the bottom of the pan to keep it from sticking and then bits of the dark stuff stuck-on stuff were floating around in my punch!  I had to strain it while pouring the punch into my Ziploc bags, which by the way, is definitely a two person job!  And even so, it made a sticky mess of my counter, stove, and floor. Also, I wasn't sure if the lemon juice had to be fresh squeezed or if bottled lemon juice would have worked just as well.  I opted for fresh squeezed, which just added to the time and work and I had to strain out the seeds.  Then for whatever bizarre reason, after 8 hours in my freezer, the punch was still completely LIQUID - no slush at all! I have no idea why that happened - everything else in my freezer is frozen solid!  Be prepared for it to take longer than 8 hours to freeze!  I had to leave for my dinner party with my 2 liquid bags of punch in a big bowl. Also, for some unknown reason, BOTH of my gallon bags leaked all over, including onto my coat and my white carpet. The punch still worked out okay, but I don't think I will ever attempt this one again.  Too much trouble!

Fantastic!  I have made this a few times for parties and it is always a hit.  Add rum before freezing and it's a fantastic slush for the summer.  From others suggestions, I also cut back on the sugar to 1 cup.  And I used Jello that was a strawberry mix (can't remember now strawberry/raspberry maybe) - liked it better than just plain strawberry.

Love this punch!  I poured the mixture into ice trays. That way I could have some anytime I wanted instead of having to wait until I had a big party.  Worked real well.  I put 4 ice cubes  of the mixture into an 8 oz class them filled with 7 up but you can adjust to suite your taste.

I made a half batch of this for my girls' birthday party. It was a huge hit!! I can't recommend this enough! I wish I had made the whole batch as everyone kept coming back for more. I will definitely make this for every party.

I made this punch for a bachelorette party and it turned out just ok.  I made the mistake of not refrigerating the ginger ale, so all the slush melted.  Since I only ended up using one batch, I saved the rest for home.  Well.....I did this one right!  It had a nice icy slush that we could not get enough of.  Thanks for the recipe.  I followed it exactly.

This punch is fabulous and it makes a lot!  I served this at my son's 1st birthday and I only went through  1/2 the recipe! I used diet Sierra Mist and low sugar orange juice for a slightly less caloric beverage!  Thanks for sharing!

Probably the best punch recipe I have ever had!  Make sure to take it out of the freezer several hours before using and mash to get slushy consistency before adding carbonated beverage.  When punch is needed, I wouldn't use any other recipe.

I went with the advise of other reviewers & used only 1 cup of sugar & ginger ale. I also used the 1 gallon freezer bags. They were all excellent recommendations. I made it for my daughter's baby shower. It was awesome!

This was a total hit at a young marrieds progressive dinner we put on last night - they loved it!! I used strawberry & raspberry jello - half 7UP and half Ginger Ale. Also threw in a few cut up and sweetened strawberries. So basically I stuck to the recipe. THANKS!

This is a wonderful punch.  I used 1 cup of sugar and sweetened pineapple juice.  I put 2 cups of rum in 1/2 of the recipe and both versions were perfect.

This recipe is awesome!  I made mine and froze it in 4 quart size bags.  Perfect to keep in the deep freeze and pull it out anytime you want punch.  My kids were so excited - who says the only time you can have punch is a party! :)

The first time I made this was a disaster as I did not let it freeze long enough. This time, I made the jello mixture the day before. I filled 3 disposable glad containers. I placed one in a bowl and kept refilling it with ginger ale as the punch disappeared. It was a big hit with my family!

Everyone is right. This is a great recipe and it calls for too much sugar. I used the bag trick and I also replaced the pineapple juice with grapefruit. I find that pineapple is too sweet and keeps me thirsty while grapefruit is thirst quenching and not as sickly sweet. I used 1c sugar and instead of fresh OJ, I used frozen concentrate. No booze, but I'm sure it could handle plenty. I also used 2, 1-gallon bags which worked well.

I made this last year and it was great.  However, I can't remember if I used a can of store brand unsweetened pineapple juice or if I went with the premium brand, Dole. Can someone tell me if it matters!

Absolutely delicious. Everyone kept asking me how to make it. I had to make several more batches of it for another party I had just so that it would last the night. People loved it!

I just served this at my first party of the Christmas season.  The entire recipe filled my green punch bowl, and looked beautiful garnished with orange slices and cherries, as shown.  It was a huge hit--only the orange slices were left!  Next time, I'll thaw the fruit mixture a bit more--we had more icebergs than slush, and the pieces were hard to break up.  I also reduced the sugar--1 1/4 cups.  Probably could have omitted it altogether.  I will do this recipe again--maybe with cherry juice instead of the jello . . .

This is good but not unforgettable that is why the 4 stars.  Reduce the sugar other wise it is way too much.

Very nice flavor, I used gingerale instead of Sprite or 7Up and it gave the punch a real bite in the back of your throat that was surprising and lovely. The slushy texture is key and received many compliments. You absolutely HAVE to freeze in gallon bags turned on their side, it works perfectly. Any flavor of jello works with this recipe, we used cherry for a beautiful red and it tasted wonderful.

I made this for my baby shower last weekend.  Everyone loved it!  I couldn't keep the punch bowl full...it went so fast!  Also, the frozen "slush" was almost a solid block of ice, making it hard to break up.  I made enough for 3 bowls of punch and I made Rum punch (for the non-pregnant adults) and regular punch.  People loved both of them!  I used half Squirt and half 7-Up instead of using lemon juice.

A big hit at parties!  I have made this punch three times and have gotten many compliments!  The first time I made it, the punch was a little too sweet.  Now, I use only 1.5 cups of sugar (for 50 servings), and it's perfect.

Mmmmmm...so yummy! I ended up combining all ingredients with only one bottle of sprite, and I have to say it was a very fortunate mistake! Ultra slushy, wonderful on a hot afternoon for a July birthday party. Pretty sure i'll be making it this way again! Next time i'll make two batches, because this went so quickly and was complimented by all. Wonderful recipe, nice alternative to the sherbet recipe punch (which i've never really liked!).

This punch was delicious!!  I made it for a retirement reception for my co worker and everyone loved it!  The only changes I made~I used raspberry jello instead of strawberry and sierra mist cranberry splash in place of the lemon-lime soda.  Wonderful and easy to make!!

I've made this punch for several occasions now and it is always a hit. I also freeze in smaller batches and thaw well in advance so that it melts more evenly. Even when I don't get the timing just right (and it's completely melted or still too slushy), the punch tastes great.

This punch was excellent!  I made it for a bridal shower and everyone raved over it and asked for the recipe.  The only recommendation I have is to let it thaw out for about 2 1/2 hour as opposed to 2 hours.  I also added sliced strawberries and oranges to the punch.

This punch was great, I cut the sugar a little. I made a batch for the kids and one for the adults(by leaving out the soda, and adding 1/2 cup of Sloe Gin, and 3 cups of Vodka, I put it in the blender with a couple scoups of ice) Everyone loved the punch, and they are still calling me for the recipe...

This slushy punch is so delicious but a huge pain to make.  Trying to get a huge baking dish filled to the top with liquid in to the freezer was not an easy task.  I ended up spilling it everywhere.  Despite cleaning up the freezer and all the contents, it was still months until I stopped finding pink remnants of my disaster. With that said, the recipe was a success.  I made it for a Halloween party that I threw and it was quite delicious...even after all the slush melted.

Great punch! I love the fact that the frozen slushy stuff keeps the punch cold without the need for ice. It was still cold after 3 hours. Delicious fruity flavor. I did cut the sugar in half like others suggested. This is now my go-to punch recipe.

Very sweet, even with a sugar reduction.  Next time I would probably only use 3/4- 1 cup of sugar (I made a half batch) at most.

Everybody loves this punch, from kids to adults. It's a great way to sneak some fruit juice into your kids! Since it is a "night before" recipe, my only comment is don't wait until late at night to make it because you have to allow the mixture some time to cool before you put it in the freezer. I made this mistake by making it at midnight for a baby shower at noon the next day. I froze it in two ziplocks and by noon the next day it wasn't quite frozen. The next time I made it I froze it in small plastic containers in the coldest part of the freezer and it froze better.

Very, very good.   I just made it for a group of 50 people, and they loved it.  I also cut the sugar in half, and found it plenty sweet.

Made this for my parents' 50th Anniversary party.  I used cranberry jello instead of strawberry.  Absolutely the best punch ever.  Made it several days before so that it had time to freeze which made getting ready for the party less hectic.

Excellent recipe! I made this punch two nights ago for Thanksgiving (11-27-2008) for approx. 15 people.  I used only one cup of sugar and my guests were looking for more.  This recipe will be come a staple in my home.  I highly recommend this punch.  I've added this to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

Really, really, REALLY good. 

I broke it down to 24 servings just for dinner. Super easy to throw together and my family couldn't get enough of it. I'd make this again and again. 

This would be good with a little rum, too.

The punch is ok.  My only complaint is that it didn't stay slushy long; by the time anyone got to the punch it was already completely melted.

Everyone seemed to like this punch. I used only 1 cup sugar as some people recommended and it was still nice and sweet. I took it out of the freezer about 3 hours before serving and tried to break it up but it was still in chunks and not very slushy. But it tasted good!

I made this for my sons 'tropical' birthday party and everyone seemed to love it. Couldn't even tell that it was made with jello. Would love to try different flavors for different colors as well. This punch is easy and nice that you make ahead.

I made this on jul 12th for an Anniversary party, I used on part with just Malibu for the adults and the other part I made with sprite, BOth were hits! Everyone kept complimenting me on this wonderful punch, Thanks! I did reduce the sugar to 2C and used Mango juice instead of lemon-lime. Great punch!

I have made this punch at every special occasion or party I have hosted for the past couple of years and it is without fail the best bunch in the world! Everyone who has ever tasted it requests it for any upcoming event. I did cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, but other than that it is perfect. I freeze it in gallon ziplock bags and defrost it only enough so that I can break it apart with my hands. I use a potato masher to carefully mash it once it is in the punch bowl. It is best if it is still very slushy. I have used 7up and sprite zero. Both taste great and it is a little less bad for you with sprite zero. I can't say enough how great it is!

This was super good and was my first time making punch.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 1/2 cups sugar, refrigerated overnight in two plastic ziplocs & got them out a few hours before the party.  One bag I let thaw a little bit in the sink and the next one I kept in the fridge until I was ready to use.  I was asked for the recipe and it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

SO yummy!! Everyone loves this! And if you want to spice it for adults only, vodka or rum both work beautifully with it! I freeze it in gallon zipper bags for less mess and easy clean up.

I made this for a baby shower with 18 people.  I made it (like many other people) in two gallon sealable bags.  I will play with the servings next time because one bag was not enough, but two was too much.  That said, it was fabulous punch.  I think if it had been frozen more than 20 hours or so it would be too frozen.  I put it into the freezer for 3 hours before I was going to serve it, then when I put it into the bowl, I mixed in half the lemon-lime soda and broke it up with ice tongs and added the rest of the pop - that worked great.  I loved the slushy consistency and everyone raved about it!

I just served this punch at a baby shower and I had the most compliments and atleast 20 of the 35 there asked me for the recipe!! I will be making it this weekend for the SuperBowl Party!!  I would get an extra 2 liter of ginger ale to make it stretch farther.  ***Update** I have made this punch about 13 more times and now every time a friend does a party they ask me for this recipe! Made it for my sons wedding and making it again this week for my daughters baby shower!

This is really good. I made this a couple of days before party and froze. I let it thaw out 2 hours before party and it was still really frozen I broke into chuncks and mixed with 7 up. The second bag I put in fridge 2 hours before party and took out of fridge half hour before party and it was impossible to break up. Next time I think I will just freeze the night before so it is more of a slush! But it was really good so worth all the trouble.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! It has such a sweet, fruity flavor. Instead of using 2 1/2 cups of sugar, I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect! I've already had several people ask for the recipe and I'm planning on making it for a get-together this weekend! It's easy to make and refreshing to drink! Enjoy!

I made this for an all teen New Year's Party. (mostly boys) They LOVED it!! One boy had the others convinced it was spiked due to the "tart after taste".  Definitely use RealLemon or other lemon JUICE (not lemonade). I froze two ziplock bags of mix, let them soften during the day in the 'fridge, and they were perfect at party time. 15 teens drank about 1/2 of the recipe. (pop was also available)  It's a keeper!

We loved this punch, I followed the reviews that said to put less sugar, so I only put 1 and 1/2 cups sugar instead of the 2 1/2 cups. I did not find it sweet at all so next time I will add 2 cups.

This punch is absolutely delicious!!  I made it for a Christmas party last night, and it just disappeared.  Everyone was raving about it and asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was that I only used 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

nice... but a little too sweet for my taste buds. Next time I will add soda water and 1 cup of sugar only.

Very good, sweet taste. The consistency was great because of the slush.  Minimal effort to make, and I had none left at the end of the evening. I got asked what was in it and did I have the recipe!  Good job!

everyone at my party loved this. I made it the night before and used the idea of other reviewers to use plastic ziploc bags. the next day all i did was take them out an hour before the party and it was ready! I also used 1 3/4 cups sugar instead of the full amount.

Prepared this last night for today's baby shower, and it was super.  Not quite sure what the reviews meant by "not slushy".  Had no problem with this...will make again; I still have the other half of the frozen mix left.

i made two batches and it still wasn't enough to keep a party of 20 satisfied! it also works well if you don't have time to freeze the punch. the only thing might be that it's a bit too sweet; i added a little bit of ginger ale to dilute it.

This is the best. This is the only punch I ever make for all the parties. It is the first thing to dissappear. It makes 2 punch bowl full, still It runs out. I used 2 zip lock bags(1 gallon)as others have suggested. Left everything else as it is. Got a family with a very very sweet tooth. Thanks a million for sharing this recipe.

This was very good!  I must say when I sampled the slush part alone right out of the freezer I was nervous... thought it would be way too fruity for my liking.  But adding the Sprite made it perfect!  I made the whole 50-serving size in one huge punch bowl, and after a baby shower with 15 guests there were almost no leftovers.  I also reduced the sugar to about 1-1/2 cups.  Thanks!

This went very fast at the party. I wish I had done second batch. I used Rasberry jello. Next time I will cut down on the sugar. The only thing I had a hard time with as the freezer bags getting stuck on the freezer shelf, but they were easy to cut off the frozen punch when serving. Thank you for the great punch recipe.

I used this recipe when I recently catered a graduation party.  There was NONE left.  Everyone young and old LOVED it.  As suggested by previous reviews, I cut the sugar in half.  I used standup half gallon freezer bags so I could press on the bag and make soft before putting into the punchbowl.  This was easier than using plastic containers. I also recently used Black Cherry jello and people commented it was better than Parrot Ice.

This was perfect punch for a baby shower - everyone commented on how good it was. But, I couldn't get it to a slushy consistency. The frozen juice just stayed in chunks. I let it sit out for about an hour before I poured the Sprite on it, so maybe it needed to defrost longer.

Absolutely the best punch ever! I wouldn't change a thing. I divided mine into quart sized freezer bags since it is just for my husband and I. We yank it out and scoop some in a glass and add some soda whenever we want a glass. Delicious!

Best punch ever.  Served this at a retirement party for 100+ people. Everyone raved about the punch and had many requests for this recipe.  Per suggestions from previous comments, cut down on the amount of sugar and it tasted GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe, it helped make our party a big hit.

I made this for my son's 2nd birthday party instead of having soda, and it was a HUGE hit.  We quickly went through both batches! Every time I show up at a family function, I get requests for it.  Thanks for a great punch recipe!

Absolutely amazing. We ran out before the HOUR was over. I did cut the sugar in half, and might even reduce it further next time.

Additionally, next time I will try storing it in plastic bags instead of containers. Had a bit of trouble getting it out of the containers.

I made this punch for a baby shower, which was a big move for me because I am a HUGE sherbet punch fan & would normally make that, but I was attracted to the slush element.  I froze my gelatin mixture in ziploc freezer bags for approx. 20 hours.  The mixture was the perfect consistency and easily turned to a perfect slush.  I used about 1 1/2 cups sugar, but I think it could have been sweeter, next time I'll try 2 cups.  Also, the taste was just a tad bland to me - next time I will try gingerale instead of lemon-lime to give it a little more kick.  But I would definitely make this again because the slush is just so fun!

I LOVE THIS PUNCH!  I made it for a Christmas party and with only about 10 of us able to make it, I thought I would have a lot left over - not so!  The whole recipe was almost gone by the end of the night!  I did decrease the sugar as other reviewers suggested (to 1 3/4c, I think).  I made the syrup and cooled it, then froze it overnight in 2 containers, and started thawing a few hours before the party.  This recipe is a keeper!

Used this punch recipe for a church event this weekend and everyone loved it.  It was gone in just a few minutes.  I should have made a double-batch.  I did add a few scoops of orange sherbert at the end.  I will definitely use it again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Great for showers, receptions or any time punch is served.   If you have any left, add rum!   Makes a great mixer too.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great.

This turned out very yummy!!!  I froze it in some pitchers and had to the bottom of the pitcher in some hot water to get the punch out because we left it in too long I guess, but it came right out.  It was great, will definitely use again.

I made this for a Christmas treat (something to enjoy throughout the day) and all of my family loved it!  It is very sweet and I only used half of the pineapple juice (I don't care for pineapple juice) but it was just as good!  Enjoy.

This punch was a huge hit, even though I didn't get the slushy effect.  (Discovered my freezer will not freeze it in 8 hours or even 9 hours.  I will definitely freeze it overnight next time--which will be this coming weekend).  As others have said, you can use other varieties of jello flavor for the base, and it'll be good.  I mistakenly bought only one package of strawberry, but I had a package of cherry on hand, so I used that.  It was excellent.

What a great recipe!!! So slushy and delicious!!! The best thing is you don't have to worry about ice melting into the punch and diluting the flavor. A new favorite!!!

This is such a fun drink and it's so easy to make!  I made it for Easter and it was a huge hit with both the kids and adults!  
It reminded me of the sherbert punch we used to have on special occasions when I was young!  I loved it and can't wait to make it again for our july 4th party!  What an extra special treat!

A total hit! I made it just as the video indicated, placing it in 3 bags after cool down...about 1 hour. I placed 50 ounces in each bag, placed it in a 9x13 pan, and froze it.  I added one 2 liter Publix lemon lime soda to the punch bowl.  Everyone raved about it.  It makes great frozen popsicles too.

This is requested by kids and adults!! It had such a good flavor. I use cherry jello instead of strawberry just because I prefer cherry. I’ve also used cherry-lemonade jello that I found in the summer. Easy to make. I also cut down the sugar by 1/2 cup and it’s still really sweet but good. You won’t be disappointed with this recipe!

I make this for EVERY event at work that requires punch.  I don't have an option because everyone asks if they are getting "Kelly's Famous Punch" - even though I always send the link to this recipe when the ask!  I decrease the sugar to about 3/4 cup at most because its definitely already sweet enough.  I mix one recipe with a 2 Liter of Sprite and a 2 Liter of Gingerale.  We never have leftovers.

This punch turned out great. I also lessened the sugar to 1 1/4 c but followed the recipe otherwise. I used strawberry ginger ale which was delicious and to keep it cold and slushy, i added frozen strawberries. Lots of complements!

This punch is a definite favorite! I’ve taken it to family gatherings and work events, and everyone loves it! I followed other people’s advice about cutting the sugar down. I only use 1 cup of sugar and substitute plain seltzer water instead and of the citrus sodas.

Way too sweet.  If I make again I will omit the sugar and instead make a sugar syrup that can be added separately at the end to taste.  Need to take the frozen mixture out of the freezer in plenty of time to melt enough to be able to thoroughly mix with the lemon-lime beverage.

Loved this recipe! Decided to make it again, with a twist and used cherry jello instead of strawberry (I prefer cherry to strawberry flavorings) and the used squirt/grapefruit soda with it instead of lemon-lime. It was a game changer! I love both recipes, but I tend to make it with a twist more often. I use it for every birthday/shower I host. This week I’m hosting a gender reveal, so I’m going to try following the recipe with a blue jello and a blue colored juice instead of orange juice so I can have two slush punches to represent both genders.

I always double this recipe so I have it on hand at a moments notice. It has been a hit at every party I have served it at. Beats the regular "cranberry punch" that everyone uses as a fall back. I have made it 3-4 times (doubled) and used it at over half a dozen functions. Sometimes it is a slush as it was meant to be sometimes it in mostly melted with small punch chunks still frozen and sometimes i need to keep it cold with ice. It has been a hit no matter how I serve it. Make it you won't be disappointed. Only change I made was I use Splenda instead of sugar. My best advise is just follow the recipe don't short cut   somehow the chemical reaction of cooking the jello is the "it" factor. Delicious.

I have never written a review like this before but had to comment on this recipe. I first made it for a girls get together and was such a hit I made it for a Christmas party at work and quadrupled the recipe for 100 people. I see again for family Christmas and now the Super Bowl! It is so popular. Everyone Loves it. The only thing I’ve changed is Raspberry jello and sometimes lime juice instead of lemon and about 1/2 sugar.  Best punch recipe ever and I know it by heart I’ve made it so much!

Very good using only 1 cup of sugar as other reviewers advised. No need for an ice ring because it’s already slushy & beautiful. Also great to mix with Prosecco!  We served it at a family party and adults could spike their own as desired. This punch recipe is a keeper!

This was a hit at my Christmas party. While I am not a big fan of using Jell-o, I figured once a year is okay.   I did only use 1 cup of sugar as others suggested and it was plenty sweet. I also probably only used about 3/4 a bottle of sprite for each half I made.  We used watermelon infused vodka which made it sooo yummy!  I would definitely make again.

I’ve made this many times as is for kids parties and it’s been a hit each time. This year for Christmas, I found cranberry jello and tried making it with that and both batches were gone! I had bottles of orange vodka and spiced rum on the side for the adults if they wanted. The orange vodka was perfect with the cranberry.  It’s going to be a tradition from now on.

We have added this to our family Christmas Eve party for the last two years. Everyone loves it!  If you live in a warmer area, sometimes traditional hot drinks just don't refresh you. This is fruity, festive,  bubbly, and refreshing!

First off, I love it.  I’ve made it at least 20 times since I’ve discover the recipe. The only thing I’ve modified is the sugar.  Instead of 2.5 cups I reduce it to about 1 1/4. I’ve always made it this way after reading a few of the reviews and it comes out just the right amount of sweet with a tiny hint of tart.

Used one cup sugar and one box cherry one box strawberry. Just right! Thanks!

Ps. 1quart is 4cups or 1L and 46oz is 1.36L. Using one frozen can OJ with the 3 cans water to make 1.18L plus a 1L of pineapple juice is almost same and cools the mixture a lot faster

Amazing!  I made a triple batch for a reception for 200. !it was a hit!  I used a second punch recipe so have about half of the base for this still in the freezer.  Will pull it out for the next house party.  I’m still sending the link to reception attendees.

I have never been a fan of fruit punch, but this was fantastic!  I used 1 c. of sugar and thought it was perfect.  I used 2 pitchers and froze 1/2 punch mixture in each pitcher.  I took it out 1 1/2 hrs.  before serving and added 7-up right away.  I had to work at it a bit as it thawed, but it turned out perfectly slushy.  It was served outside on a 90 degree day and stayed slushy until it was gone.  Everyone loved it.

It's good :-), it really does go fast.  I did cut down on the sugar though. Made this during a work cookoff, and this actually won the drink category!  Also was a hit during the past graduation party a month or so ago.  It's good, because you can also make in advance.

We make this regularly for parties and it’s always a hit with the kids. I usually freeze it in batches (ziplock bag in a loaf pan works great for portioning) and then mix each block with sprite or similar soda. Usually end up with four portions, and I also cut the sugar by at least one cup

Made it with 1.5 cups of sugar.  Tasted delicious, everyone said so, but was not completely thawed in time.  Made it and froze it the evening before my event.  Got it out of the freezer an hour and a half before serving time.  Mixed it with soda, which was cold, probably should not have been.  After sitting out for a good 45 minutes, still not thawed enough to make a smooth slush, was a very chunky slush.  Ended up adding 2 bottles of soda to one block of slush to get enough.

Delicious.  I halved the recipe and it served 10+ at Book Club. I received many compliments.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 for half a recipe  (so 1.5 cups for a full recipe).

FYI, the full recipe gives 2.25 gallons or 9 quarts.

This really did not go well for me :) I made the punch portion before hand and froze it. 

When it came time to combine the frozen portion with the Sprite, nothing went well :) The frozen portion would not melt for ANYTHING. I ended up with slightly red-tinged Sprite and then an incredibly syrupy slush after a while.

This was very well received at our church function. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2.5 and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I used 4 large Ziploc bags, filled them by lining a pitcher with a bag (it help to have 2 people do this part because the ziploc bag can slide down), and froze them on a cookie sheet overnight . Took them out 2 hours before serving. The first batch I did have to break into medium large sized pieces before putting in the punch bowl with the 7 up about 1 hour before service, and at service it just required taking a large spoon and breaking some of the pieces into smaller chunks and stirring.  The second bowlful about 30-45 min later was perfect texture without doing anything. This will be my go to punch recipe. So easy because it is prepared ahead and everyone loved it!

Made this for a baby shower and it was fantastic! I did cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and it was perfect. I froze it in two gallon-size bags and laid them flat to freeze. I ended up only using one so I have a bonus extra waiting in the freezer. I took it out a couple of hours before the party and the slushiness was perfect at party time. So easy!

I've made this a few times, and we love the flavour, but definitely find we have to use A LOT less sugar.  about 1 1/2 cups.

I just hosted an eclipse party, and this pretty, frothy, slushy punch was perfect for a hot summer afternoon. I found this recipe made exactly enough for two punch bowl sized batches. I cut way back on the sugar by using sugar free jello, only  1 cup sugar, and pouring over a two-liter of sugar free Squirt over each batch. It was perfect and definitely did not need to be sweeter.  I made it days ahead and froze it in two gallon sized freezer bags which I stored flat in the freezer. On party day, I moved the frozen punch to the refrigerator for one hour and then thawed the first bag another hour on the counter. It was right at slush stage at that point and I added it to the punch bowl and poured over the Squirt. Since we had kids here, I served them the punch out of the bowl, but I added a shot of sparkling wine (you don't need to buy the expensive stuff since you're mixing) in the adult cups before pouring the slush punch over.  Everybody LOVED the stuff.  Not a drop left.

Rave reviews from our BBQ guests!
I took note of all of the sugar in the jello, soda and the natural sugar in the juices...2 1/2 cups of additional sugar seemed way over the top.  I used a 1/2 cup (tops) of splenda ...next time I will try without any extra sugar at all. 
Its awesome - will be my go-to.

Very good.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup after reading other reviews and will reduce it even more in the future.  The drink just doesn't need the sugar.  I also used diet soda and no one could taste the difference. I made one batch with pineapple rum and triple sec and the other with no alcohol.  Both were great!!

Made this for Christmas and was a huge hit! Will become a regular tradition. We enjoyed it just the way it was and I made no changes to the recipe. They only thing I need to do different is find different containers to freeze. One or two large containers didn't work well as it took longer to thaw in the punch.

I have made this recipe countless times and everyone loves it. I tend to use a little less sugar because I think it is sweet enough, but other than that, I follow the recipe. Everyone (especially kids) loves the slushy part of the punch--including me!

We made this for the first time last year for a big family party and it was a MASSIVE success!  We call it Jingle Juice for holiday parties!  Definitely only add 1 CUP of sugar, I accidentally made it as written once and it was way too sweet.

I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cup, but I don't think the full amount would have been too sweet. Next time I'll try the full amount. I don't understand the lady who warned about the heat. I boiled (rolling boil) for 3 minutes then poured in room temp pineapple juice and it turned the mixture lukewarm. Added the cool OJ and lemon juice and poured it into two freezer bags. Into the freezer they went! The bags can be used in the microwave so the tiny bit of heat left in the punch was no problem. Can't wait to serve this "slushcious" punch for Halloween!! The video diluted the recipe by dividing it into three bags and using 3 (2 liter) bottles of soda. They also lost the luscious color!!

I used regular Sun Drop as the soda, and kept the sugar at 1 cup.  Took this to a church function and it was so easy to pack up the frozen freezer bags and mixing ingredients.  They drank every drop and wanted more!

I followed the recipe as stated with 2 modifications: I used vegetarian jelly (jello) mixes from the Mideast market instead of general supermarket jello mix which contains gelatin and isn't suitable for vegetarians/vegans or those who eat only halal or kosher products. And secondly, I used 1 cup of raw sugar rather than what the recipe calls for. For the lemon juice part, I hand-juiced about 3 large lemons to get the 2/3 cup. The frozen mixtures were pulled out of the freezer the morning of a baby shower and set on the counter to thaw for a few hours before going into a mason jar drink dispenser. I used Sprite lemon-lime soda. Really delicious! Everyone loved it.

I have used this punch for every birthday party since my daughters second birthday (July 2012) It is to die for! Can anyone break it down for me to make half of the recipe?  My daughter's turing 6 tomorrow and we're not having a big party like we usually do. I know I need to start it tonight but I'm exhausted. Her party is at 4pm central time tomorrow Saturday July 16th. So a quick response from someone would be great! Thank again for the best punch recipe ever!

I made this punch one time for an office party.  Let me tell you it was a hit!!  Now it's the only thing my co-workers want me to bring when we have a pot luck.  I like that it makes enough for 2 bowls and I get to keep one batch to save for another time.   Definitely recommend giving this a try.

This was fantastic!  The flavor were a perfect mixture, without any need to alter the recipe.  I chose this because it would satisfy a large group of people, and I'm so glad I did.  Everyone enjoyed it and we still had more left over... it would probably be a good idea to get extra lemon-lime soda since people want to keep making more and more, and some also like the weaker strenth balance.  I plan on making this over and over, whenever I have a large outdoor gathering, or in front of a fire during the winter.  Thanks for this!

I make several batches of this for the holidays. The adult version is with vodka, the kids without. It's very sweet, but everyone loves it.   I have found that freezing over night gets it pretty solid, so I put it in the punch bowl about an hour before serving to soften a bit.

The consistency is great, but way too sweet. I followed all directions, except left out 1/2 c of sugar. I think I might try this recipe again, but next time will start with 1 1/2 c sugar.

YUMMY!!! Would give it more stars if I could.  I have made this many, many times & I wouldn't change a thing! (Be sure to have copies of the recipe with you when you take it to a picnic or any other event!!)  Recipe is easily doubled & I like to make the "base" well in advance, freezing portions in ice cube trays or other smaller containers, then using as much as needed when preparing it to serve.

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out great! I did make a lot and I only used half for a 20-person baby shower. I made the full recipe though and now I have a frozen portion all ready to go - just add Sprite! Great color, great taste, great texture (slushy, but easy to drink, doesn't get watery as ice melts.
 
My one challenge was I didn't have a pot big enough to mix all the juices (i could have used a stock pot) and then I didn't have many containers with lids big enough to freeze two portions. I ended up using several small tupperware for freezing, which actually worked well. With the punch frozen in smaller portions, I was able to serve small batches at a time (I used a pitcher... don't have a punch bowl) throughout the party so it was always cold. Very easy prep for the day of... you can do everything in advance! Got lots of complements on the punch, loved it myself and would definitely make again!

I’ve made this a dozen times or more, just as instructed,  and there is never any leftover - it is a favorite for sure! Great for all occasions but especially pretty as a Christmas punch (a shot of vodka pairs nicely too). I never put mine in the freezer - just chill over night - it’s still great!

Delicious punch, and all the guests raved about it and wanted the recipe when I served it at a recent baby shower. Because the guest of honor was having a girl, I wanted to have a true pink punch, so I substituted Cran-Strawberry  for the orange juice. I also used ginger ale instead of lemon-lime carbonated beverage to keep it from being as sweet.

I started making this punch several years ago for our Thanksgiving gathering.  It is now requested (and expected) whenever we have guests over.  It is great on its own or can be used as a base for an adult  beverage.  It is loved by all!

I didn't think this recipe through...  Put the mixture in the freezer in pitchers the night before.  Then, when I was trying to finish the punch for Christmas Eve it was frozen solid... I thought I would put it in the microwave for a couple seconds like I saw in the suggestions, however, it didn't dawn on me that the pitchers wouldn't fit...  After soaking the bottom of the pitchers in hot water I was finally able to get it out and mix it up, but it was quite messy and time consuming.  Lesson learned.  On the positive side-- everyone did say it was the best punch they've ever had. I did use only 1 cup of sugar like others suggested.  I will definitely make again, but  thought I would save others from the same dumb mistakes I made :)

First off, this punch is a winner! Definitely cut down the sugar to 1 cup. Also, upon making it for the first time (and after reading a few dozen comments) I realized that something should be specified IF  you want a SLUSHY punch. (Although it is still spectacular without it.) So, if you freeze it solid, in a freezer bag laid on its side, as many suggest, then you do not need to take it out an hour or two early! Once the liquid hits the solid it will dilute quickly and you can lose the slush potential! I believe those who freeze this in a container DO require an hour or two to start the thawing process, as the frozen mixture is denser.  I added cranberries and mint leaves and served it as a holiday Jingle Juice! Have I mentioned how good this is!?!

One tip . . . I chilled my 7up which I think was a mistake.  (Keep the soda room temp)  When I poured it over the punch blocks, the punch blocks wouldn't melt.  It was pretty hilarious to see this awesome appetizer spread with the hostess (me) over in the corner hacking away at the punch block.  BUT once we got it thawed slightly and it was so slushy and good, every single guest wanted the recipe.  Delish!

This is great! It tastes like something you'd get at a restaurant, but it's so easy to make! I halved the sugar based on the other reviews and am glad I did, it was just sweet enough and anything more would have been overpowering in my opinion. This drink has a real kick to it for sure, very tart and delicious! The flavors blended together so well. No ingredient overpowered the others in my opinion, which made for a great drink! I'll add that I didn't end up making this for a lot of people, therefore I didn't bother with serving from a punch bowl. Since that's what the directions are based on I'll give some quick advice to others who might want to skip the bowl. For the container, I used a ziploc bag inside of a plastic pitcher. When it was time to serve I filled the pitcher with warm water (with the bag still sealed inside of it) and let the mixture sit there for a minute to soften. Then I used an ice cream scoop to get the frozen punch out into the glasses. Rather than using the big 2 liter bottle of soda, I just got some of the individual-sized Sprite bottles (the kind I got were the very small kind they sell now, I think cans would be a good size too). It worked out really well this way, since otherwise I think the punch would have gotten a bit too slushy as time passed - this way it stayed frozen, the soda didn't get flat, and each cup was as good as the last.  Another plus to this method is that it gives more freedom to adjust the drink to different tastes by adding mor

I followed the advice of other reviewers and only added a little over a cup of sugar. I froze the punch mix in two gallon bags just as others did and it worked out just fine. The only person in my family that didn't like it was my niece and that was because she doesn't like pineapple. I thought it was really good and I am definitely going to try other flavors of Jello. Great!

I make this for an annual holiday event I host. I love the punch! It is however, VERY sweet!!! Beware! 

Only downfall is that it is a pain freezing it and then getting it out of the bag and to the perfect slushy consistency (even using room temp soda).

I made this punch for a church function and it was heavenly. Everyone kept coming back for 2nds and 3rds, glad I mad sit for 100 servings and that was almost not enough. Some people just wanted the slush.

I've made this twice, once for a wedding shower and once for a baby shower.  An absolute hit both times.  I can't get over how guests love this punch.  At the baby shower, guests took turns slushing the frozen punch.  It became a party activity as well as a crowd pleasing refreshment.  It's my go to party punch!!

This a favorite in our home and has already become a tradition.  My children refer to it as 'birthday party punch' and now expect it at every family member's birthday dinner.  It is sweet so I tend to use a less sweet soda in it and cut back on the sugar just a bit.  I make it in double or triple batches and store in the freezer in zip lock bags so I can just pull some out for each birthday.

Served this a my daughter's baby shower and it was a big hit...everyone wanted the recipe. I floated frozen strawberries in it...awesome. Quick and easy to make ahead of time. I'm serving it this Thanksgiving and will float cranberries this time. Can't wait for the reaction :) It even worked with a punch bowl with a spout...poured out just fine and looked beautiful.

This was very good and i like that it included so many real juices (making it seem healthier) but it was a bit of a pain to make compared to the rainbow sherbert punch we normally make. And while everyone thought it was good, I don't think anyone was really Wowed.

This was a great recipe. However, I should have prepared this the day before but it was quite easy and because you split the portion, it didn't take long to slush!

I followed the recipe exactly. Once you pour in the ginger ale it turns the perfect slush consistency! But I did not care for the flavor combo and thought it was too sweet. And I like sweet but not this sweet.

Everyone loved this slushy punch which I made for a friend's wedding shower. I also used one cup of sugar and for more tartness I used Italian soda. 5 liters would have been better than 4 since there was ice and no liquid left at the end of the party. Many guests asked for the recipe too. Thanks, Valerie, for sharing this great recipe.

I made this for a bridal shower and it got rave reviews, so much that I was asked to make it for the reception as well. The only problem I had was that it definitely didn't thaw in the time frame given! The second time I made it I froze it in smaller containers (about 3 cups each), let it thaw in the fridge overnight and then threw it in my food processor and it came out perfect! Based on other reviews I also halved the sugar both times.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it would have been too sweet with the entire amount of sugar.  I used lime Jell-o and diet ginger ale.  I served it at my son's 5th birthday party.  It all got consumed, and people were asking for more.  Definitely a keeper with the reduction in sugar, unless you like your punch really sweet.

Everyone loved this recipe. It was a bit messy to prepare but it was worth the mess. My husband used this punch as a chaser. The kids and I enjoyed it as a slush. Very tasty and sweet.

I had 12 Ladies for Bridal shower and we drank the whole recipe!  I cut the sugar and used half sprite and half sparkling water to make it not too sweet - had a bottle of vodka on the side for those who wanted to add it to their invididual drink to make it fun!  Will make this again.

I went with other reviewers and used less sugar, a cup would be good, I used a cup and a half, because I forgot. I saved this recipe a while back. I made this up for my husbands birthday. My whole guest list LOVED this. We have small children, but could easily see converting this to an adult beverage with rave reviews! Great job Valerie, I will be keeping this one in my recipe book from here on in! Hoping the second bag works for my daughters birthday in 2 weeks, I will update so you all know!

It was so easy to just pull out of the freezer and add the soda (I used Gingerale instead of Lemon lime) when needed.  Everybody loves it every time I make it.

This punch is absolutely wonderful!!  I made it at my folks 60th anniversary party and everyone raved about how good the punch was.  I did use about half the suggested amount of sugar and it was perfect.  This will be my go to punch recipe from now on!  Thanks Valerie!

Made this for a Valentine's Day party for Girl Scouts. They loved it. I made a double batch and divided into many freezer bags. The extras came home and my son was so excited when I made him a big cupful last night. You can just pull some leftovers out of the freezer and mix it up on the fly.

Excellent punch! Half the sugar is plenty sweet. If you entertain often, this can be made in a large batch and stored easily in ziplocs in the freezer...such a time-saver for future festivities. Thank you for this great addition to my punch repertoire, Valerie Lynne!

Whew, sweet for sure, but if you like sweet, you'll love this.  The "slushiness" doesn't last long/melts quickly.  It does separate rapidly, so be prepared to stir often, and drink fast!  I reduced this to 12 servings, measuring the Jello on my scale, and it turned out well.  No little kids here, but I'm sure they'd love it!

We followed what others suggested about cutting back on the sugar. I made this for our family Christmas party. It was a huge hit. We ran out of punch within 2 hours. Most of that was b/c we limited how much the kids could have. Otherwise, it would've been gone in a half hour. We were getting asked to make more. We will definitely make this again, only I'll be at least doubling the recipe.

I loved this punch and so did my guests! As others have mentioned I used a lot less sugar, I actually only used 1/2 cup and next time I may leave it out all together. I can't imagine how sweet it would be if I used 2 1/2 cups since this was plenty sweet and I like sweet stuff :) I served it with white wine for those who wanted some alcohol I filled their glass 1/4 full with wine and then filled it with punch. Great recipe thanks!

I made this for our Christmas Eve party this year and can say, without a doubt, this will be the punch recipe we use every year!
I made it exactly as listed - no changes at all.  
I made this about a month before the party and took it out of the freezer about 1.5 hours before the party.  I grabbed the Wal-Mart brand lemon lime soda (they were out of 7-up) and will continue using the knock-off soda as it tasted terrific.
It stayed slushy ALL day - very impressed.  
Some adults added a shot of CIROC vodka to their cups and it was terrific. I was asked for the recipe no less than 6 times that day and have been asked to make it for a New Years party.  So, all in all, an absolute success!

Froze some in ice cube trays and freezer bags.  Works well with lemon-lime sodas and sparkling beverages.  Microwaved the freezer bags to just-softened-state and used potato masher to create slush.  Makes enough for several small parties.

WOW! I can't imagine how sweet it would be with 2 1/2 cups of sugar. I used just over a cup and it was fantastic.  I used a metal whisk to break up the ice chunks and it worked great!  I would certainly make this again!

This was AMAZING! I also only used 1 cup of sugar, and it was perfect. I split the punch into three ziploc bags and lay them flat in the freezer so they would freeze faster.  I honestly couldn't believe how fast this was going.  Since there was still frozen punch at the bottom of the bowl, I kept adding cans of sierra mist until I ran out of cans!  I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe!!  I am always in charge of punch for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year.  Last year I told my family I was going to try a new recipe (this one) and they were all very hesitant.  After everyone sampled this Christmas Day it was declared a winner hands down!! Thanks so much for sharing!!

I dislike standard punch recipes.  This, however, is really, really good.  I did cut back on sugar as a lot of reviewers suggested.  People love the taste and the look of the punch.

Delicious and refreshing! I served this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit! I used only 1 cup of sugar and found it to be sweet enough. It is difficult for one person to get the mixture into the large Ziplocs.

I made this for my daughters birthday party.  It was a big hit.  I may add a little more sugar next time, since our punch is usually pretty sweet.  It was nice however not to get a sugar rush after just one small glass.

I made this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it. We had 17 people and there was only a little left over even though we offered several other drinks. I will definitely serve it again.

I made this for a 100.00 a plate fundraiser reception.  Made two batches and ran out.  Didn't change the recipe.  it was 100 in the shade here so and it really quenched their thirst.  On my list of fav's.

This is fantastic punch.  I forgot to take it out to thaw before the party, but it still turned out great after I put it in the microwave for a bit and then into the punch bowl with lemon-lime soda.  I love that it didn't taste anything like those frozen punches at the store!

I served this at an outside baby shower, and it was a big hit! It didn't stay in slush form because it was too hot outside, but I served it over ice and it was still just as great! I also cut up strawberries and let them float in it,.. made it really pretty, and they tasted great in it. I am going to make it again for my upcoming luau. Thanks for sharing!!

This is hands down the best punch I have ever tasted! I made it for a baby shower last weekend and there was none left and everyone said how much they loved it. I made the recipe like it states except I only used 1 cup of sugar. This is now my "go to" punch! Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good.  I made enough for 100 people, it was easy to make ahead of time and then just use as I needed it... So good.  I made the recipe just as it was except I used only half the original amount of sugar.  I think this will be a staple for all parties from now on!  I must say I was nervous of how it was going to turn out with the jello, but as long as you take it out of the freezer and leave it on the counter, it will be perfect!

I made the recipe exactly as directed, and it was very tasty but too sweet.  I had squeezed fresh lemons for the lemon juice and had hoped that would cut some of the sweetness that I had read about in reviews, but I came away from drinking a cup of the punch feeling like I needed to drink some water and brush my teeth.  I think next time I'll cut out about a cup of sugar and see how that goes.  The flavor of the punch was very good though.

Yummy.  Lots of requests for this recipe.  Made it three times--we liked it best with GingerAle. Once had to use cherry jello still tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe I will never buy that frozen cube thing in the grocery store again!

The punch was delicious! I followed previous reviews of using only 1 cup of sugar and freezing in 2 one gallon ziploc baggies.  Everyone at Christmas dinner loved it! Will definitely use again!

I made this punch for Thanksgiving. It was an instant hit! I used fresh squeezed lemons, fresh squeezed tangerine juice and I added a bit more sugar, everything else I made per the recipe. Unless, it is summer I will freeze the punch for only a few hours.

I made this for our cubs scouts Blue and Gold Banquet - doubled the recipe and it was GONE quick!  I had tons of water and soda left because everyone drank this instead!  I also end up making this for every holiday, at the special request of my eight year old.  BEST!!!!

I made this for my daughter's 16th birthday party.  We had 23 teenagers.  I doubled the recipe and all that was left was a few cups.  I made it in the early morning and it was the perfect consistency for the evening party.

This is simply the best punch ever--not too sweet or too tart.  I make it for all of my families holiday celebrations or just for a get together with friends.  Children seem to love it just as much as adults.

Yummy...I spiked it with a whole bottle of gin and used about 1 liter of club soda with just a little lemon-lime soda, otherwise it would've just been too sweet.  It went quick at a couples poker night we hosted-I had to break out the second bag. Give yourself time to thaw it, too.

This punch was wonderful.  I made it for Christmas Eve when all of our family came over and they couldn't get enough.  I followed others suggestions and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I thought the amount of sweetness was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was great - adults and kids alike enjoyed it - although be careful on the serving amount you make - I still have tons of the concentrate in my freezer. (Can't hurt to be prepared for company, right?)

I followed this recipe exactly (except that I halved it and served it to 25 instead of 50) and thought it was wonderful.  Very good flavor!

The only thing was that I started letting the ice block thaw two hours before the party (because I didn't put into two different containers since I halved the recipe).  So we didn't have the "slush" part for very long once the party got started.  Once the slushy ice was gone, everyone just poured the punch over ice in their cups and it tasted just fine.  I think next time I'll pull the ice out of the freezer only 1 hour before the party starts!

This was really good but it didn't taste great until the frozen block melted quite a bit.  Next time I make it I'll only freeze part of it in ice cube trays so the flavors combine right away.  Also I cut back on the sugar like other reviewers advised.

Oh my gosh this is soooooo good.  I would drink it everyday if I could.  Just a tip, use a knife to break the frozen part into smaller pieces once it's in your punch bowl otherwise it won't be very slushy.

This was fun to make and tasted great.  I think the sugar needs to be cut back a tad, though.  Thanks!

Very hearty punch. Everyone loved it, especially those who usually avoid traditional punch.

Served this at two parties and it was a hit at both.  Cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it tasted great!

I made this punch for our Christmas Eve family get together and everyone loved it.  I also cut down on the sugar after reading the reviews.  The only problem I had with it was it never got slushy.  Everyone loved it anyway, I want to make it again for new years eve.

I had to give this 5 stars because it was the biggest hit at my last party. I thought it was a little sweet but everyone else really loved it.

This was a huge hit with my girlfriends at a group gathering.  I used raspberry jello, reduced the sugar to half as suggested, and divided the recipe into two tupperware containers to freeze.  One container served the eight of us with leftovers, and the second batch was used at a party 2 weeks later.  This will be my new GO-TO recipe for punch!

I made this punch for a bridal shower, and there was none left by the end of the party.  I also received multiple requests for the recipe.  I did decrease the sugar, and also used sugar free Jello along with diet lemon-lime soda.  No one seemed to notice!  My husband also likes to "drink" the semi-frozen slush without the soda for a refreshing treat by the pool.

It didn't turn out as slushy as I expected but it was still great. You can even stretch it by continuing to add more soda as it gets low and its still great. I didn't add as much sugar as it called for but it would have been good either way depending on your taste. This was a hit by everyone and is now requested at all our parties! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

Finally had the chance to make this, and I'm so glad I did.  I did a test run, and used the full amount  of sugar.  It was way too sweet.  For the next batch, I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and it was perfect.  I made it for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a huge hit.

Excellent. Recommend taking out of freezer and pouring in the soda about 30 minutes before guests arrive.
