One of my favorite sandwiches!! I melt the cheese on the burger, then put the egg on top - I don't cook it totally firm. It's messy but wonderful. Also good with a grilled chicken breast instead of hamburger.

Chef Danielson, my hat is off to you.  It is so nice to see a young person in the kitchen and your recipe works! It's delicious, but at my age it will have to be a once a year thing or my doctor will throw the book at me. Gotta watch the cholestrol. Your steps are all clear and concise.  I do hope you will contribute often.

Man friendly for sure. My husband loved this burger. He even asked me to make these for him to take to work. He did request adding bacon next time. I didn't care much for the egg and burger taste together, but he said, "This is a great burger!" as he was finishing off the last few bites. Thanks.

Love this recipe, the egg makes so much of a difference on the hamburger.  Adding bacon did bring out more flavor and made it over the top.

Yum.  One of my eldest ds' favorite sandwiches - I enjoy it too but rarely indulge.  :)  I prefer mine on a roll but it's good on toasted bread, too.

This is a once or twice a year burger for me.  Throw in some hash browns, bacon, and a little sausage gravy with hot sauce and it rocks.  It might just kill you, but it still rocks.

This is definitely a 'man'wich. My husband loved it! And, I could see a lot of guys would like this. I didn't find it as the best; I think I would put some ketchup on it next time. I grilled the burgers instead of pan frying them. We're not fond of fried burgers. Thanks for posting!

Delicious! Sometimes the simplest recipes turn out to be some of the best. I subbed Johnsonville's Italian Ground Sausage for the beef patty which proved to be a wonderful choice. This "anytime" burger was great for breakfast served with a nice big glass of OJ!

In Wisconsin, we have been making that hamburger in our bars for years, the only thing that is different is we add a couple of strips of bacon to it, and don't cook the egg too much, because you want to have some of the yolk run out, they also do the same with a grilled chicken breast, minus the bacon on that one.  Another one that I tried which I really didn't think I would like, but it is called the Gormet burger....1 1/4 pound burger with 2 strips of bacon, with a thin shmear of peanut butter on the grilled bun.....I was really surprised on it's taste!  My friend who is a firefighter in Green Bay told be about that and the place that makes it and also said about he and about 30 of his fellow ff's tried it and they all loved it, so I figured , well, now I have to try it, quite tasty and glad I tried it too

Yum yum yum!! I'm so happy to see so many people enjoy this recipe - I make these all the time and thought that I was the only one!

I like to throw a burger patty onto my George Foreman grill, crack an egg into the frying pan, and prepare my toast while the two are cooking. The burger and egg end up done at the same time and I have a hot, delicious sandwich ready in 10 minutes! Onions and jalapenos are my favourite toppings.

I do prefer to cook my egg over-medium though, to make the sandwich a little less messy. Over-medium still gives me creamy yolks, without dripping all over the place.

I use whole wheat bread, everything is the same except the cheese and there I use a mild limburger thinly sliced. To add a little zip I also use onion, again thinly sliced and diced jalepeno peppers, the hotter the better. If you want to spice it up a little use a few dashes of tobascco sauce. A cold beer on the side and you will soon be in heaven. My M-I-L tried one of these and I haven't seen her since, OK with me.

While living in South America during the early 80s, I was served cheeseburgers with fried eggs on top. This took me back to those wonderful years. I like the idea of white bread because I am Gluten Intolerant and find that white bread is much easier to digest than whole wheat bread. I sprinkled some crunchy fried onions on top that I made with gluten-free flour and really ejoyed that sandwich. Thank you Chef Danielson.

Love this recipe.  I add bacon and hot sauce...yummy!  Never would have thought of it myself but they have a similar burger at Hard Rock Cafe and it came highly recommended by the waiter.

This is a great combination that I never would have thought of trying. A popular restaurant in our town makes their burgers "dirty" by adding a fried egg. Don't knock it till you have tried it!

Soooo good. I did have to add the bacon as my family LOVES bacon. Toasting the bread (or if you use a bun) makes all the difference.

great burger,but I would add a few things to it.I would add mustard and ketchup-not a whole lot but just enough to tatse along with the mayo.I would add sliced onions to it,either white,sweet,purple,or vidala when in season.I gotta have a piece of lettuce,and as far as the cheese,I'd put swiss or pepper jack if available.The bacon,yeah,if I had some,but I am not a big fan of bacon on a burger.I do love bacon on BLTs and club sandwiches but not burgers.I would salt and pepper the egg before eating,cause eggs are so bland without salt & pepper.As far as the egg goes,I might would scramble the egg just for drippage reasons from the yolk.Oh and a nice big slice of tomato always works for me.

Love, Love, love this burger recipe. I make this often  and have been since I was a kid and my uncle introduced me to it. I thought an egg on a hamburger would be gross but it was delicious. Now I make this for my own family! My husband loves it with swiss cheese and bacon. I love it with swiss or pepperjack, and tomato, no bacon. All in all, great recipe!

This has been a favorite for years.  My dad used to make these when I was a kid (40 years ago).  In college we called these "awesome burgers".  Hamburger, egg, cheese, fried onions, lettuce tomatoe, bacon, and whatever else you happened to like or find to throw on it.

Having visited Australia many times, I found out that a hamburger is not a hambuger unless it has a fried egg on it there.  They also top with a slice beet root.  Waay too good!

Yummy :)  I sometimes like to vary this recipe with a slice of swiss cheese instead of american, and also add bacon on occasion.  Keep up the great work, Chef_Danielson!

You see hamburgers like this in Japan.  It's a fun combination and a nice change of pace from a plain hamburger.

Recently had a breakfast burger similar to this. As good as this one sounds, with the addition of bacon and served on texas toast it really rounds it out. The calories must go completely off the chart then, so enjoy as you shouldn't have another for a LONG time.

in 1960 while in apple valley calif. I use to eat at a little dinner and have a burger, I then asked for an egg on it. so he did and had one himself and said that was good, them the next day I asked to have cheese on it also. that started a trend in apple valley calf.

Excellent in its simplicity and non cluttered taste. Good job. A little mustard is good on this as well.

Great simple and oh so filling. Try using peanut butter instead of mayo...sounds weird but when it melts with the cheese....hmmmm.

Well-done, Chef D :)!  So cool that a young guy is interested in cooking!  Keep it up!  We call these farmer burgers here in PA and they're a popular treat.  My boyfriend loves them!  I've not tried it with bacon, but I'll definitely take that suggestion.  Keep on cooking!

I have made burgers with fried eggs before, but have never seen such detailed information for a burger that has only 6 ingredient and that includes the two slices of bread.The part where it said to top with the other slice of bread and when finished will look like a sandwich, was a bit much for detail. But it does make a good burger.

With some slight variations, we call this the Hangover helper! Use pre made burgers that have jalapeño and cheese in them. Substitute  pepperjack cheese for the american and add bacon. Throw it all on a deli style bulk roll and feel the hangover melt away! We cook these at every NASCAR event we go to!
