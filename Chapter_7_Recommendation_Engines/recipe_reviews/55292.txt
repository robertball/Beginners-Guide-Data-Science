I have made this recipe several times and it is found on the back of the Reese's package.  It went well with my godchildren, my mom, her co-workers, friends and my co-workers.  At my job, the staff always ask me to make this sweet treat.  However, for the addition of nuts, the recipe goes wonderful either way.  On one occassion, I only had those little small bag of diamond walnuts.  They are about 1/2 cup in serving size.  I am not a big nut person but I must say it complemented the recipe well.

These baked well and made a good batter, but you should be an avid fan of peanut butter because the pb chips are more easily tasted than the choco chips.  They weren't as chewy as the regular Tollhouse cookies and also, my chips didn't melt well.  Overall - good cookies for pb fans.

Yum! My teenage daughter made these and they were wonderful. Better than traditional chocolate chip cookies.
