I think the people that changed the recipe are not Italian. American 'ITALIAN" recipes are sometimes too thick and laden with garlic and oregano. Oregano is for pizza, people.
Make this recipe as the chef wrote it sans the oregano. Try Sweet Basil instead and you will thank me for it. You need all the broth to coat the pasta. Trust me.

I've made the sauce twice in the last week to keep up with a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes.  I doubled the sauce recipe the first time, tripled it the second.  In the triple batch I added some fresh garlic and a can of tomato paste with Italian Herbs.  I think this will freeze well.  To reheat I added a little milk or Half and Half for a tomato cream sauce.  It could also be served as a homemade tomato soup.  The flavors really do blend well, and it takes very little effort to make it.

4 stars as written, 5 with one modification - cut the chicken broth in half if not more. I heeded other reviews and made a double batch with only 2c broth ... I was worried it was a little too watery still, so I cooked my (fresh) pasta in it, and it was pretty much perfect. If you like a really thick sauce, I'd suggest cutting the broth back even further - you can always add more!  The flavor, the ease - absolutely outstanding. AND, I have a great use for all the cherry tomatoes and oregano in my garden. Thanks, Chef John!

Very easy and tastes excellent.  At first the sauce seemed too liquidy, as others mentioned, but it was perfect after pureeing the tomatoes.

Very tasty and a great way to use up our cherry tomatoes from the garden. Recipe is way off on amount of broth though. Start at one cup is my recommendation. We followed the recipe and the consistency was like watery soup.

I halved broth as others recommended and found no need to puree tomatoes- just smashed them after they got tender.  Also added roasted red peppers from a jar.  I had Gruyere to use instead of parmesan.  Absolutely no complaints on the substitution here.

This recipe is perfect if you switch out the oregano and put in basil, as suggested before. I don't like spicy, so no pepper flakes for me. You don't want to reduce the chicken broth; you;re not making a thick sauce. After the sauce and pasta are prepared, you pour the pasta INTO the sauce, not the sauce over the pasta. Then you stir it and let the sauce work its way into the pasta; the broth helps the sauce coat the pasta. Love this recipe - now my go to for pasta sauce when I have cherry tomatoes.

This is an amazing recipe and freezes great! It is a go to at the end of summer to use up leftover tomatoes. If you are going to only prepare the sauce (without the pasta), only use enough broth to cover the tomatoes. If you are going to prepare it as written and add the pasta to the sauce, you will need all of the liquid.

It feels wrong to review this recipe since I used a different tomato I had no idea was planted in my garden--beautiful large orange tomatoes I had no idea what to do with! I figured just use 2-3 cups worth (2 large orange tomatoes) and the result will be the same as the sun gold tomatoes—aren’t they orange/yellow too? Well, let me tell you...really delicious and light tasting, perfect balance of sweet! Other than the tomato, I followed the recipe to a T and did not find it too salty or spicy (used Chef John's chicken broth, which I froze weeks ago). The only difference for me was that I thought I had too much sauce and continued cooking my tomatoes (after blending) to reduce it (about 30 minutes while waiting for water to boil and cooking the pasta). Maybe 2 C. broth is too much or I had too much tomato. It was still a thin sauce, but when poured over the pasta and mixed together, the penne just soaked in the sauce. When the pasta was done, I added some cooked Italian Sausage (mild, casings removed) to the pasta and then poured in the sauce. It was my first time making sauce from fresh tomatoes. So, if you have large orange tomatoes, I would blanch them first, remove the skins, and chop/quarter them before proceeding with the recipe. Just thought I'd mention this in case someone new to gardening is looking for how to use low acid tomatoes. UPDATE 8/11/16: Made this recipe twice now as written and the results are the same, DELICIOUS! Don’t change a thing!

I added minced shallots to the garlic and tomatoes, cut the chicken broth by a half of a cup and added a fourth cup of cream.  I also added some roasted broccoli and mushrooms at the end.

I made it almost as noted. I reduced hot pepper flakes by half which was spicy enough for me, used basil instead of oregano and added a few sun dried tomatoes. I also did not add extra salt as it is already in the stock. Threw in my food processor after cooking and it was lovely. If you had roasted red peppers I think that would be nice addition as well or spinach. Very fresh tasting.

This was the best thing to do with cherry tomatoes.  We had tons of them.  I halved the chicken both as recommended.    Added more garlic and fresh oregano.  I also added some cooked chicken.  Delicious !   I bet Chrissy eats it for breakfast tomorrow.

Delicious! I made this because I wanted to use up some of the cherry tomatoes from my garden. At first I wasn't pleased with how broth-like the sauce was but it is so tasty that it didn't matter. You could add some vegetables and make a great soup base.

Four and a half stars, but not five. Wonderful flavour but the sauce was very thin. Maybe I'll try it with less than two cups of broth next time.

Just a pinch on the oregano.  Oregano is for pizza!  Lots of basil is the way to go with this sauce.  Plus, I had some leftover string beans that were prepared in garlic & oil, so I added them at the end.  Also grilled some chicken & placed strips on top.  Delicious meal!

Great recipe.  I used 1/2T each of oregano flakes and basil, only 1/8 T hot red pepper flakes.  Used 3/4 chicken broth (low sodium) and 1/4 cup half and half, totaling two cups of liquid.  Exceptional, not thin at all.

didn't like it at all, even added less red pepper than it calls for and it was still too spicy.  Ended up adding it to another pasta sauce because I didn't want to waste my tomatoes.  I definitely would not recommend this recipe.

This was very easy and tasted good.  I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used dried.  Also, I reduced the pepper flakes for someone else in the house.  There was still lots of thin sauce after stirring into the pasta for a few minutes, so next time I will use only 1.5 cups of chicken broth.  I'm sure we'll be making this throughout the tomato season -- what a great way to use our cherry tomatoes and yellow pear tomatoes!

Made it exactly as written except just a pinch of peppers and I used sweet basil instead of oregano since that is what I had on hand.  Then when I was about to add the pasta I realized i didn't have Penne so macaroni it is!  Pureed the tomatoes in a magic bullet.  Took one reviewers suggestion to add pasta to the sauce vs sauce to the pasta.  It is delicious!

I only used 1 cup of broth, and I just smushed the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. I used basil, and reduced the liquid down quite a lot, then added a splash of cream at the end. Served on tortellini instead of penne. Really good!

Used an assortment of tomatoes from my garden, about 3 cups in total once roughly chopped. It was superb! I highly advise heeding other bakers’ advice to halve the broth- was still a touch watery, even with half the broth!

This was amazing!  The only change I made was that I added ground turkey meat and added regular black pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again!!!

This is very good and I will definitely make this again! I was making it for my mother and myself. and needed to control the heat/ For myself I like the heat and added a bit of tobacco to my bowl.

Loved using up my garden tomatoes! I love cutting corners and since so many people said it was too much broth I put in the 2 cups but cooked my pasta in with it! That's right- one pot!!!!! I added pre-cooked chicken and it was a one-pot meal! It could have used some Italian seasonings with the addition of the chicken.

Very tasty. I would use less chicken stock next time. More watered down than I expected.

Boring. A waste of my cherry tomatoes. First time I’ve not liked a recipe on AllRecipes. It was watery, bland and boring. If I were to ever use it as a starting point for a new original recipe I would use less than half of the chicken broth. And add in lots more cheese to try to get more flavour.

Delish!  I added and extra garlic and italian seasoning.  I did one cup of broth after looking at other reviews.  It is tasty.  I am serving it over ravioli tonight.

I've made this twice and had it with cheese stuffed tortellini the second time . both were absolutely delicious.
I'm thinking of doing it with a little less broth and adding some heavy cream to see what happens (no offense chef John) I love all of your videos and you inspire me to create..
Let me know if anybody has tried this and the result was....

This was really good; I agree with other reviewers as there was a lot of sauce I compensated by using a pound of pasta vs. the 14 ounces.    I also added grilled chicken breast which complemented the sauce.  Will definitely make it again.

I don’t love cherry tomatoes but we have lots of them in the garden so this was a good variation from “popping them” straight from the vine. I will likely make it again.

Delicious!! I used 4 cups of yellow cherry tomatoes and only 1 cup of broth and it turned out excellent. The penne is the way to go as it does soak up the sauce very well. I froze extra batches for the winter. Can't wait!

Made this today.  Found it a bit runny but loved it anyway - used with gf pasta so maybe it did not soak up the sauce like regular pasta.  Has anyone canned this sauce?  I am a novice canner - I use the hot water method- and I'm not sure if this is safe to just can as is.

What a fun recipe to play with.  Not that it needs any tweaking as it is delicious, but sometimes I have basil instead of oregano in the garden.  I also grow a variety of tomatoes so don't just make the sauce with cherry tomatoes.  If I use larger tomatoes, then I blanch and remove the skins first.  
Sometimes I add langostino and shrimp and serve the sauce over spaghetti.  So many ways it can be used.

I doubled the recipe, omitted the red pepper (didn't have it) and used a bit of heavy cream and linguini.  It is a great sauce and turned out really well.  Great way to use up cherry tomatoes.  Be sure to blend it really well to minimize the skins' texture.

I made some modifications for the sake of this recipe being vegan: Replace vegetable broth with chicken broth, use imitation Parmesan cheese, and also add about two tablespoons of tomato paste and a pinch of cornstarch to thicken the sauce in the last step of the recipe. It will turn out absolutely delicious.

I simmered the totamoes longer than the recipe called for (probably about an hour), so the stock had reduced down some, probably making for a little thicker sauce.  I also added some fresh basil, and used dried oregano.  This sauce was very easy and tasty!

positively delicious! I added slightly less vegetable broth and I didn't blend it just smashed the tomatoes when they were soft.  I also added basil and much less red pepper just a couple of flakes.  let it cook down a bit longer to thicken.  perfect!

This was my first vegetarian dish and it was delicious. I don't have a blender so I just mashed the tomatoes. It worked really well. I think the little bit of tomato skin really added to the sauce texture.

So easy my husband can do it! Plus it's a nice way to put our crop of cherry tomatoes to use! Thank you.

I made it exactly as the recipe calls and just added half of the sauce and it turned out perfect. I just saved the rest. Also I added a shallot, a jalapeño, and basil and omitted the oregano. The end result was fantastic!!

Just made this yesterday...a friend gave me about 8 cups of cherry tomatoes, I adjusted the recipe/seasonings accordingly and it came out just great!  I did cut back on the chicken broth for the amount of tomatoes I had...and a lot on the red pepper--I thought it might have overpowered the delicate cherry tomato taste, and I'm pleased with the result!  It's a wonderful light, not dense or heavy sauce, perfect for going over penne pasta.  My friend can give me more cherry tomatoes any time!

I made this sauce with both red and yellow cherry tomatoes and it was terrific, I had to make a lot more and store it in jars. I did add some grated parmesan to thicken it just a bit.

I made this sauce for the first time today with a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes.  I followed others and reduced the chicken stock by 3/4.  I also tripled the garlic (we love garlic) and used Italian seasoning mix instead of oregano.  After cooking I used an immersion blender and then strained the seeds and skins.  While I did make modifications, it turned out to be an amazing sauce I will make again!

This is SO good! It is thin but so what. One can thicken it up if desired. I'm drinking it like soup right now.
