The flavor is GREAT!!  The dish is wonderful. But....  the sauce is not a sauce but a paste. I made it twice now, don't add the flour (none) and the sauce is perfect.

This recipe was great.  It was a nice surprise to find the olive inside the meatball and it added extra flavor that you weren't expecting.

This recipe was wonderful!  A good twist on the ingredients of ground beef, sour cream and egg noodles!  Very big hit!

These were okay. I love olives and dill but the two flavors didn't seem to blend here.

I was leery of the olive/dill combo but I tried this since it was so highly rated. OMG. My family LOVED this. It's the new go to every time we get fresh dill in our farm box.
