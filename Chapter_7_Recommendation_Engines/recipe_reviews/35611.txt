Wonderful! The sauce is what really made it a hit! Originally, this recipe stated 1/4 cup orange marmalade - not sure when it changed to 4 Tbl., but it was perfect as initially written!  I doubled the sauce to make sure everyone got plenty (which is 1/2 cup marmalade + 2 Tbl. mustard). I baked it at 350 for 15-20 minutes, then took it out, and turned up the oven to 450.  I put it back in when preheated, and let the coconut toast until golden.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy to throw together and I loved it.  I did dredge my salmon in flour before dipping it in the egg and instead of serving the dipping sauce on the side I spooned it over the salmon and used leftovers on my rice.  YUM.

So easy and fun!  What a great way to serve salmon.  A wonderful change of pace from the mustard/dill recipes.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Very easy and delicious! My husband, who made a face when I told him we were having Salmon, had 2 pieces!!! After 15 minutes the fish looked done but the coconut was still white so I put the broiler on for just one minute and it toasted the coconut on top very nicely, it really looked great when served!! I'll definitely make this again!

The orange juice and coconut enhances the salmon's flavor and adds the unexpected to a salmon dish - a little crunch, a tiny bit of tangyness, and just the right amount of sweetness.  Whatever you do, don't skip the dipping sauce - it is excellent! I'm very impressed that such a simple, easy recipe could make such a delicious, classy dish!

WOW -fantastic. An extraordinary and tantalizing affair with the taste buds and a change of scenery from the mundane diet. Be careful when using a toaster oven to prevent dryness b/c temperatures vary and the acidity from the orange juice already cooks it. Who likes dry fish? I would highly recommend this to those who enjoy a flirtatious flavor. LOVE it!

This recipe is definitely going in my 'favorites' folder.  We loved this!  I used finely shredded, unsweetend coconut ('Lets Do...Organic' is the brand).  I found that 3/4 cup coconut was all I needed for 4 fillets.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt to the coconut to enhance the flavor of the salmon and balance out the sweetness of the sauce.  And the sauce - it's so good!  It was hubby's favorite part of the meal.  I thought the salmon was great by itself, but when you add the sauce, it's excellent!

I kind of hacked this recipe, and it was still delish!  I can't wait to try to make it again with some forethought.

For anyone else making it on the fly, instead of marinading the salmon in OJ for 8 hours, I marinaded about 2 and then poured the oj into the dish to bake with them.  (Of course this meant the entire fish didn't have the coconut coating, but I toasted coconut to serve with it to compensate)

I also didn't have orange marmalade.. so I used apple and added a ton of orange zest.  It did lack something, (which was probably due to not really following directions) but it was still really good.  I might try to add ginger to the sauce, I think it might round the flavor out nicely.

Pretty good.  I didn't have marmalade, and bf is not a huge fan of mustard, so I made him a honey dijon sauce with a creamy honey dijon salad dressing and honey.  He loved the coconut salmon bit.  I liked it well enough but I guess didn't like it as much as other salmon I've had.  I'll have to try again when I have marmalade.  thanks for the recipe!

Be warned: I only bought a 5 oz. bag of coconut, and it was waaaay more than enough. I coated the salmon until there was no more room for coconut! Unfortunately, after dredging egg-coated salmon through the coconut, I had to discard a very large amount. What a waste.

I advise dumping a little at a time onto a plate and adding more if you need  it. Don't throw away 3/4 a bag of coconut!

Pretty good salmon, though. Even better sauce.

This was delicious!!  And easy, as stated.  We both loved it, though my husband complained that there was "so little" of it (I cooked 2 6-oz fillets!).  It's a pity that coconut is so high in saturated fat;  I hope the salmon helps offset that because I want to make this often.  The sauce is wonderful and would be good on a lot of other things,too.

amazing! towards middle of the fishing season we're always looking for original ways to cook the fridge/freezer full of salmon, and this fits the bill! Easy, delicious, and unique. One of my favorite recipes - I've made it many times already.

The hubs and I enjoyed this.  I didn't have orange marmalade, so I used my homemade peach jam instead.  I did add a splash of OJ to the sauce to give it that less-sweet flavor.  I also used spicy brown mustard as I had it on hand, and it balanced nicely with my jam.  Like others mentioned, I used far less coconut than the recipe called for.  I also made this spur of the moment, so only marinated the salmon in the OJ for about 30-40 minutes, and it was still quite tasty.   ***revised*** This tasted even better when I reheated it the next day on 40% power in the microwave until warm.  The orange flavor came through really well.

Everytime I have made this recipe everyone has loved it and wanted the recipe.  It also sounds completely fancy and full of effort when it is in fact simple and effortless.  I have made this many times and will continue to do so.

Wasn't that keen on this one. There was to much competition between the flavors of Salmon and Coconut. Possible a different Fish could be used?  I will reuse the marmalade/dijon sauce again with the Salmon....

I did not like this with salmon. I will try it again with halibut or other wild, mild tasting fish. With the salmon I found the flavors orange and coconut competed with the natural (and delicious) flavor of the salmon.

I tried this as something different. The first piece of advice (which I didn't think of) is to get dry coconut, not the moist baker's type, that way it will stick better to the salmon and won't need to be mashed on like mine was! In addition, the sauce was wonderful. I served it with white rice and salad and the sauce was being tried with everything. I'll definatly use this one again.

I enjoyed this very much - will try to use fresh (i.e., unsweetened) coconut next time, as it seemed a bit sweet.  Easy and delicious!

I just recently returned from Alaska and I brought back some fresh red salmon. And this recipe was FANTASTIC! My family loved it! The orange juice took the 'fishy' smell away and the glaze was unbelieveable...I highly recommend this recipe. And get this, I don't like fish! But this was great.

I'm not a huge fish fan but I thought this recipe
was good for fish. It reminded me of my favorite appetizer.....coconut shrimp. I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe required.

I used cod, marinated in orange juice for 7 hours. Used unsweetened coconut with salt, pepper to crust the fish. Baked at 350F for 15 minutes, coconut browned nicely. Added 1 1/2 TBSP honey dijon to marmalade, was good, could spice it up a little more. Husband enjoyed meal and suggested keeping remaining sauce for later.

Very interesting and good tasting dish !! Didn't change anything on the recipe. Such a different flavor with the orange and coconut pairing with the salmon. The dipping sauce was very, very good !! I will try that on other dishes !!

I don't know what happened, but I found that everything tasted extremely bitter.  I even followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe use orange jam instead of marmalade?

Not for me.  These are all ingredients I like, but it didn't taste good together.  Can't figure out what went wrong... but now I've got tons of leftovers of expensive salmon that no one is touching.

I liked this; my fiance did not. He didn't like the flavor of the coconut with the salmon, but I don't like salmon much and so I loved that it disguised the flavor.

The coating on the sides of my salmon did not cook well, so I think next time I will leave the egg out, since the coconut seemed to stick better anyway to the salmon without it.

Absolutely Wonderful!!!!!  My husband raved over it.  He said it was "worthy to serve to company for dinner."  It was a perfect combination of flavors - make sure you make the dipping sauce.  I will probably double the recipe for the dipping sauce next time.  I either cooked it too thick, or it just wasn't enough for four fillets.

I am living in Nova Scotia, Canada where we consider our Atlantic salmon the best!  I thought I knew just about every delicious way to prepare it, but Ellen, your recipe is fabulous!  It is easy to prepare, looks gourmet, and the taste is a 5*+.  I served it with mashed potatoes that had a little butter, light cream cheese, milk, garlic and pan fried onion (chopped fine)mixed in.  It was a wonderful meal that I will serve again and again!  Thanks for taking the time to give us this recipe.

Very good and VERY easy!  Only had time to marinate for about 2 hours and it still turned out wonderfully.  I usually have to tweek recipes to our liking, didn't change a thing with this one.  Of course, cooking time depends on how thick your fillets are.  Cooked mine for almost 30 minutes.  Thanks!

I have had this recipe twice and each time I thought I was in heaven.  This is a delicious way to serve salmon, and the dipping sauce is scrumptious.
Thank you Ellen for this delicious experienc.
