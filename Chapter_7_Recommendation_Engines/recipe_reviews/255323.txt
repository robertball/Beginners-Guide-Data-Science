Very tasty! I always love the green pepper-pork chop combo. Only change is I added more mushrooms. Will make again!

used ingredients as listed and cooked almost as posted. I did this all in one pan. I used an oven proof skillet, I browned the chops, and removed from the heat.I then cooked the onion, pepper, and mushroom in meat juices. Added liquid and loosened pan drippings added cream simmered a minute or two and then put chops into cream mixture, covered and put into an 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. Very good.

We liked this very much.  I did make two minor changes:  calrose rice rather than jasmine and orange bell peppers rather than green---both personal preferences (you fix what your husband will eat---lol).  I made my own creole mix from a recipe on this site, and I'll have to go back and add more of the cayenne to the mix because I was going a little cautious on that one.  I also added some of that seasoning to the sauce.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Nikki!

I  cooked bacon until it was still pliable and wrapped the bacon around each pork chop.  I also used a little of the bacon grease with the butter when making the sauce. Wonderful recipe even without the bacon.

We thought this was delicious! I did season the sauce a bit b/c I felt it was a little bland, but other than that I made this as written. Very easy to make and very tasty over the Jasmine rice, which I LOVE. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious, and very easy to make. The only modification I made was to add some garlic powder and salt into the heavy cream and flour mixture (as I tend to do whenever I am making a gravy-like sauce). My family loved it! I also chose to use boneless pork chops, but the recommended cooking time still worked just fine.

This is a great, homemade weeknight meal. I don't usually make cream sauce, but this one was really nice. And the peppers and onions add a nice crunch to the dish.
