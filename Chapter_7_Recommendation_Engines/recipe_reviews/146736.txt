I made these for the third time last week and agin they were loved by all. My top tip is to put cut the coconut first to make it a little finer and perhaps toast half of it so you get a bit of contrast. Try them people!

Have to add my 2 cents- these are fabulous!!  I like them with dark or milk chocolate more than white, but adding a white drizzle to the dark/milk coating is very pretty.  I also tried just drizzling dark & white over the balls without dipping, which is very nice.  Yum!  I'm thinking about plopping an almond on the top for the next batch.

These were pretty good but I just didn't care for the texture of the filling. It was grainy and too moist.

These were nice - I wouldn't say exceptional though.  the mixture fell apart easily, especially when trying to put the almond inside the ball.  I dipped these in white chocolate that was mixed with coconut - I loved the finished look.  I topped them off with some green/red colored coconut for Christmas.

Great flavor!  But, mine ended up quite mushy. I think the filling may need more to bind it together and for me, there was too much cream added to the chocolate so it didn't set up hard enough.  I am going to play with this recipe though and try to improve it because the flavor was AWESOME!!

Unlike everyone else, this recipe gave me a great deal of trouble & I don't even like the end product. I'm pretty sure it'll be a hit though. My issue was with that the white chocolate coating (I used Baker's squares) never would set up -- it remains tacky even after freezing, and nevermind what it's going to do in the refrigerator. My recommendation to others is to use a standard 12 oz chocolate to 1 TB shortening melt for dipping (half that is sufficient for this recipe, so 6 squares and 1.5 tsps shortening melted together). These will probably be loved -- if so I will re-rate this at a 4 but if it remains 3 that means that overall this recipe was pretty neutral for us. Thank you for posting, I'm not sure why this didn't work out for me like it did for everyone else, I do love trying something new :) EDIT: I promised to come back and change my rating from a 3 to a 4 if these were loved, and they were. People were thrilled. I'm not one of those people, yet I may wind up being requested to make this recipe again, so it deserves the 4th star.

Wouldn't make these again. The dough was to wet to work with and they did not taste as good as I thought they would based on the previous reviews.

I made these for a party and when I got home had an email from two of my friends wanting the recipe.  I love how pretty they are.  Also they are easy to make.  My kids had a blast helping me.  Next time I will double the recipe.  Thanks for this Christmas candy keeper!!

These were very good and rich, but I would have to say they were too mushy. It took mine almost 2 days to really set (and I followed instructions!)
