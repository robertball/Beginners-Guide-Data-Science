VERY IMPORTANT!! The pudding in this recipe is a SMALL PACKAGE-3.9 oz.  NOT 5.9 oz.  I weighted out 5.9 oz. and added it to the mix and my cake fell!  I don't want anyone else to make this mistake.  I am going to try it again with a small package of chocolate pudding and next time I am going to put chopped pecans in the bundt pan before I pour the batter in and bake it.

This is tasty enough, but there is nothing that really sets this cake apart from other mass produced cake mix variations. Subtle hints of chocolate and coffee and, love it or hate it, it is definitely evident there is liquor in the cake. I didn't care for how thin the glaze was, though it might be nice as one of those glazes that coats and soaks into the cake.  I just added enough powdered sugar to get the glaze of drizzling consistency.  Overall, a rather average cake mix cake.

This was a wonderful surprise.  The cake is very moist and very easy to make.  And it does get better after it is refridgerated.

One of the best cakes I've ever made! Only change was that I made a mix from scratch. So moist, rich, and delicious... If I made it again, though, I would put in a little more coffee liqueur and a little less oil; I would have liked that taste to come through more.

I love this kind of recipe because it's a jumping off point for what you can do with a cake mix.  I don't understand why the recipe doesn't call for a chocolate cake mix.  I'll try that next time.  The only other thing I did was use all Kahlua instead of any water (1cup Kahlua, no water).  I also ditched the glaze mix because that sounded like a big mess.  I used the glaze recipe from the rum cake from this website.  It's cooked butter and sugar. I subbed Kahlua for the rum.  The glaze soaked in and made the cake verrrrrrry yummy!  Again, a chocolate cake would make this truly "mocha."

This cake is great.  I did not however like the icing so I kept adding powdered sugar to make it thicker.

It was ok. I don't think refrigerating it first helped the flavor at all.  I think it would've been better warm.

OK, I've learned my lesson, I will read reviews BEFORE I make the recipe.  Unfortunately, this time I didn't have enought time to read the reviews, or at least one relly important review from Diana who warned others not to use the 5.9 oz of pudding, use the smaller pack instead.  Like her review predicted, my cake fell.  It looks awful, and the taste is just OK. So, for everyone wanting to make this recipe DO NOT USE 5.9 OZ OF PUDDING!

It's okay.  Nice and light and fluffy, however maybe it was the Starbucks Coffee Liquor I used.  It was just a little too "boozy" tasting for me.  I didn't even use the coffee liquor for the glaze, instead I used 1/4 cup of real coffee and the powdered sugar.
However everyone else in the office seems to like it.
Very simple to make and comes out of the oven nice and light and fluffy

Delicious!  Didn't make up as much glaze as the recipe called for, just enough for a quick drizzle over the top.  Will make again!

The base cake is very good - and I did use the 5.9oz package of pudding and it turned out very fluffy and light... but does have a definite liquor taste (again, like it or hate it).  If you could improve the glaze, maybe add nuts to the bottom of the pan it would make it stand out more.  Overall, a bit average without making it your own.

I didn't have coffee liqueur so I use chambord.  I also used raspberry vodka instead of plain vodka.  I accidently left out the sugar and it was still a hit.  Good to know.  I also use 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar for the glaze and added chambord tablespoon by tablespoon until it was the right consistancy.

I loved making this cake. Firstly, after reading all the reviews, I decided to double the amount of Vodka and Callua I used in the cake batter. Maintained the same amount of Jello. I added the icing with 2parts callua and 3 parts convection sugar. Refrigerated overnight, however I was not satisifed with how that looked, so I made another chocolate and marshmellow icing ( 3 cups of minature marshmellows, 1 cube of semisweet chocolate and 3 tablespoons of butter into a pan and heated until thick. Poured over cake. Everyone loved it. Last note: when you had confection sugar and callua mixture, it will settle at bottom of cake.

I, too, have made this cake many times, and my friends beg me for the recipe.  I only make one change...I use White Chocolate instant pudding instead of chocolate.  This week,for the first time,  I noticed the difference in the ounces of the pudding so I used 2 boxes [which totals more than the 5.9 oz. in recipe].So I added a little extra liquid.  The cake rose high and fluffy...then collapsed after cooling! However, it certainly didn't affect the flavor and it was more moist [but not pretty!]I'll probably go back to using just one package for appearances sake! If you want to use the 1/4 cup liqueur for the icing, you need 1 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar. This is not a glaze but an icing!  So, just adjust your amounts according to the taste and consistency you prefer. Some foods are just better the second day...it's like the flavors intensify. This cake is great warm or cold.  Quick and easy to make.  Thanks, Michelle!  You created a real winner!

I followed this recipe exactly and baked it according to the time given in the recipe. It BURNED to a crisp on the outside.  The inside was moist, but I could not serve it to guests.

I did not have success with this cake.  While I enjoyed the flavor, the cake itself was very spongy.  I could tell the texture was off when I was adding the batter to the pan.  No one complained about the cake, but no one really loved it either.  I won't make this again.

This cake is OMG good!!  Thanks to the previous review, I used the right amount of instant pudding.  I did, however, use a different glaze, but I'm sure the cake would have been just as good with the one called for in the recipe.  I would definitely recommend it and have already had to give out the recipe twice!

I followed this recipe perfectly except I didn't have any white sugar, so I used brown. Some people liked it...I expected more of a coffee/chocolate flavor, but it was kind of bland in that sense...but it had great texture-very moist.

I first made this cake a couple years ago and everyone LOVED it. It tastes sooo good and after you eat one piece, you'll want more.
