MMM good. I cut back on the chiles and used red bell pepper. Added chicken to make this a one dish meal and cut back on the cheese. May have added more seasonings but I really didn't pay attention. Will make this again for sure

I wish that there was more flavor, and I even added more cumin and garlic than called for in the recipe. It has great ingredients and could be delicious but it's missing something... but I just don't know what!

Really great, but I thought maybe using some fajita seasoning might spruce it up a bit, and I had some green chilies salsa too.  Gotta love those summer veggies fresh from the garden!  Use 'em or lose 'em!

This recipe was delicious. I used diced zucchini and yellow squash combined. To the onion and green pepper I also added red pepper for a little more color. I added fresh garlic to the vegetable saute in place of the garlic powder and also used garlic salt. I could not see the point of sauteing the zucchini because vegetables are supposed to be cooked until they are crisp tender, not mushy. I used 1 4 oz. can of green chiles and 1 4 oz. can of green salsa since that's what I had  on hand. I also did not add flour to the (low-fat) sour cream because I didn't feel it needed it. I used a little fahita seasoning to the mix as well as some chopped cilantro. I doubled the amount of tortillas and I added shredded chicken to make it a complete meal. Each serving was topped off with some diced avocado. It turned out perfect with the exception that it was not spicy for our taste so next time I will add a diced Jalapeno or Anaheim pepper to the vegetable saute. Corn would also make a nice addition. Thanks Brandi for another delicious way to use up our summer squash.

This was very good. I added taco seasoning instead of the spices. Added black beans instead of the eggs. Lastly, added plain yogurt instead of sour cream.

Rob really liked it and said it tasted like mexican lasagna.  In the future, I would ditch the eggs and add diced cooked chicken, black beans, and salsa.

Can cook raw chicken right in the skillet with the veggies.

Very delicious! My husband went back for seconds. I followed another review and replaced the eggs with black beans & made tortilla chips out of the extra corn tortillas. Great dish!

Instead of 2 cups of sour cream I used 1 cup & added 1 cup of cottage cheese instead. Excellent! I will definitely make this again!!!

This was tasty and not difficult to make. I will make it again. My husband and I really like spicy food, so next time I might amp it up a bit and add jalape√±o and a little more cayenne pepper.

Had an issue with the eggs so beat soft tofu with the sour cream to add protein. Top with Tapatio for added spice and flavor when eating.

This recipe did not have very much flavor to it. Maybe if I tried adding some more seasoning. My husband loved it, but I could not eat very much of it. Maybe 1/2 a serving before I decided zucchini is not for me.

This was really good.  I used less chiles, and it was still hot enough for me. I topped it with a little chunky salsa and served with tortilla chips I made from the corn tortillas.  Will be making this again.  Will probably use a smaller casserole dish so it will be thicker.
