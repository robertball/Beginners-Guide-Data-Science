Hey all. I'm usually very generous with my 5-star ratings. I am NOT a picky person, so most of the high-rated recipes I try are worth 5 stars. This one was NOT!  I followed the recipe to a T, and the brownies didn't get done. I baked them for a friend and ended up throwing the mush away.  If you're looking for the "best brownie", try the recipe on this site called "Best Brownies" with over 1200 5 star ratings. THOSE are perfect brownies. Even the taste of these undone brownies was too rich for my taste, and you can't often say that for I LOVE rich foods!  Sorry, just not my cup of tea I guess.:-) Ally

I have been using this recipe for years.  It became the most requested thing make so I had to restrict it to a "Christmas Only" item.  The only ingrediant that is different is the vanilla - I don't use it.  A couple of things I have found that have help me is to:
#1 Melting your butter is the way to go... it allows you to spread 1/2 the cake mix like frosting for the bottom cake layer rather than pressing it into the pan.  
#2 Melt the caramels (and evaporated milk) in the MICROWAVE (for about 3 minutes on high) Use as much or as little of the caramel as you want.
#4 The remaining half of the cake mix… I take a teaspoon and “blob” the mix on top. It allows for the caramel and chocolate chips (and whatever else) to peek through.
#5 The last helpful hit to cut the bars into a size of about 2 bits – more than that the richness overwhelms people.

I wish I could give this one 6 stars! Yes, it is THAT good! I made these last night for my husband to take to work, but of course I had to sample them first. They are sticky and gooey and "out of this world" delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly; the only thing I did differently was to melt the caramels with the evaporated milk in the microwave instead of on the stovetop. It was quicker & easier. Also, I lined the baking pan with non-stick foil and sprayed it with Pam for easy removal of these sticky little delights! I'm sure I will make these again and again; thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

If you need a fix for a sweet tooth...you've come to the right recipe.  These actually make my teeth hurt...but they are absolutely sinful!!  With the 1/2 cup of batter that's left over...we roll portions of it in our hands and then pat it out as flat as possible to try and cover the top.  We have a little "river of caramel" flowing around the top after it's baked.  We've also given this out as gifts to people who can't stop eating after just one...their that good!  Thanks so much Sandee.

I've made these brownies twice. The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. The 2nd time, I experimented a bit and they turned out amazing! Instead of baking the first half of the mixture alone, I did this- pour the first half in the pan, spread out. Top with the caramel mixture and then the chocolate chips. Bake on the bottom rake of the oven for 8 minutes. Remove from oven. Spread remaining brownie mixture on top. Continue baking as instructed on middle rack of oven. This makes the caramel and choclate layers absolutely incredible! Make sure they are cooled well before cutting! These brownies are now requested by my son's swim team for every meet.

These are absolutely incredible!  They appeared quite underdone when I took them out, but they were perfect when cool.

Very good recipe!!! As a previous reviewer stated, PLEASE MELT THE BUTTER. I made two batches, one with softened butter the other with melted. The melted butter one spread a lot easier. The topping browned wonderfully in the oven too. 
I substituted golden vanilla cake mix for blondies. 1 STICK OF BUTTER WAS ENOUGH.

I was a little leery about using a German chocolate cake mix as I’m not a big fan of it, but it turned out perfect!  I made these for my husband this weekend for Valentine’s Day as his favorite brownies are turtle brownies and I usually make them from a box… this was my first attempt at “from scratch” turtle brownies and they are delicious.  Definitely will make again.
Oh yeah, and definite begin melting the caramels before you par-bake the brownies… I waited thinking that eight minutes would be enough to melt them, but I was wrong… it took a few minutes longer.

Made these for my softball team, they raved and requested the recipe.  Only changes . . . used devils food mix, Pam w/flour, melted caramels in the microwave, cooked an extra 10 minutes.  So easy & turned out delicious.

Way to sloppy. Nothing like a brownie. Its really more like a cake with a runny filling. If I ever attempt this again I will try actual brownies, not a cake mix. Its also really rich, which its good, but I was really hoping for a gooey carmel brownie.

I made these as per the recipe (except no nuts) and they were great. I'm reviewing them because I read the review that said they were too goopy and doughy, and right out of the oven that's what they were like, and I thought they didn't turn out. After cooling for about an hour, they turned more brownie-like, I was able to cut them and put on a plate, and they tasted great.. everyone said they were yummy!

These are absolutely the best brownies!!!!  I have made them many times and received raving reviews!  After bringing them to a block party on a rather cold day, I discovered that they are awesome cold so now I refrigerate them!!  Makes them less gooey.  They are very rich and sweet so I make sure to cut them into smaller portions.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

These are THE BEST caramel brownies. I will use this recipe from now on. I followed the recipe exactly except I used one stick butter (1/2 c.) and 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce instead b/c I didn't have enough butter. It couldn't have made much of a difference b/c they were SO GOOD and went quickly!

I made these for a dinner get together. They were very good. My husband said they were some of the best brownies he's ever had. My only issue is thate the caramel gets kind of hard around the edges of the brownie. Even using cooking spray and a non-stick pan they were alittle hard to get out of the pan.

I was in a pinch trying to find something vegetarian to bring to a potluck. I remembered my sister had made something like this for years but couldnt get her on the phone. Allrecipes came through with the EXACT same recipe and it was perfect! This is a VERY rich dessert but so easy to make! It always impresses and brings people back for more!

Oh these are sinfully delicious!  I actually came across this recipe by accident.  I was trying to make Chewy Caramel (from this site), but it set up way too firm.  Not wanting to waste the caramel, I found this recipe  and melted 14 oz. of it with the evaporated milk to make the caramel sauce.  Also, I used a Devils Food cake mix and no nuts since that was what I had on hand.  Yum!

I've made this several times now and it's quite the hit with my co-workers. I couldn't find german chocolate cake mix, and use Devil's Food instead. The brand does seem to make a difference. I used a store/no name type brand once and it wasn't as good as when I made it with Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker mixes.  Didn't have a measuring scale for the individual caramels, counted out 40 individual squares instead. Omitted the nuts as there are some people with allergies and lastly completely forgot about the chocolate chips! LOL. Still excellent without the extra chocolate chips. It is very rich. And I like that they're easy to handle as squares, makes this excellent for packed lunches and picnics.

Very delicious! I made these for Memorial Day weekend, brought them to the cabin and were gone in one day! Next time I will try either a different type of cake mix or actual milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. If you are counting points through WW, a pan of 32 equals 5 point per brownie. .....Evil brownies....

I had made something almost identical from a recipe in a magazine several years ago, but before I knew how good these were, I'd misplaced the magazine.  I don't recall that the recipe that I had used butter, but I will give it a shot.  Yes, these are somewhat of a pain to make, but they are worth it.  I've always had rave reviews.  The possible combinations are endless.  I've made them using strawberry cake, chocolate cake, german chocolate cake, spice mix cake... I just vary the chip accordingly to match better (ie strawberry w/ white chips).  I would recommend not incorporating the nuts into the brownie mix itself, but instead just sprinkle them into the chocolate chip and caramel layer, that way you can just put them on 1/2 if you have people that don't like them.

My family has been making this recipe for years, it is always a hit. One challenge though is that now the cake mix and caramels are coming in smaller packages (probably cost the same though!). Bags of wrapped caramels are only 11 oz, cake mix is now 15.25 oz. So you have to use a slightly smaller pan and slightly less evap milk. I kept the chocolate chips the same though, but used belgian chips, slightly darker chocolate than semi-sweet.

These are wonderful!!  The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet (household preference - I didn't even have semi in the house).  I think I would like to try making it with margarine another time instead of the butter, and maybe cut back on it a little (fingers were oily when eating a piece) but otherwise, I didn't adjust anything, including the cooking times.  Just make sure to cool completely when it's done.

These brownies are so delicious - fabulous recipe!  Instead of the German chocolate cake mix, I used chocolate fudge and didn't put in the nuts, but other than that I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I did find it difficult to "spread" the last of the brownie mix over the caramel, but the end result was so worth it.  They are so moist, and served these for Christmas eve dinner dessert and got so many compliments.  I will be making these brownies again for sure.

These brownies are amazing! Super easy to make and they have just the perfect amount of caramel, nuts and chocolate chips... They are super rich though! Next time I'm going to try making them with only 1/2 cup of butter and maybe add a little bit more condensed milk....

I'm only giving this 4 stars because my recipe differs just a tiny bit.  Try using two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than just one.  They turn out gooier and delish!  Gone in 5 minutes at any potluck.

I made several times and everyone keeps asking for more!  It was a bit too sweet the first time so I only put half of the caramels in the second time and it came out perfect!  Also, it is a bit tough to spread the batter, but worth the effort!  will keep on making them!  thanks for the great recipe!

Although the taste of these brownies are delicious, the effort in removing them from the pan quite possibly is the reason that I may not make them again!  My advice would be the GREASE the pan heavily and be sure to not overcook them-- I think 30 minutes is plenty.

Wowzers!  This recipe was excellent.  I sent them to work with my boyfriend and they were gone in less than an hour.  Instead of a German Chocolate mix I used a Dark Chocolate Fudge box cake.  I also used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet.  I was a little worried since I misjudged and had much less than half of the brownie mix left to cover the caramel, but I continued to bake it as the directions stated.  Not a problem... after they cooked and cooled to room temperature I put them in the fridge to make them easier to cut.  Also, going by some of the other reviews, I used a little less than half a stick of butter, and they were still super moist and gooey.  Overall, these were delicious, and I will definately be making these again. Worth the effort.

These brownies are the best, especially when you consider it is just a cake mix. I have been making them for years and the original recipe that I had said not to use a cake mix that has pudding in the mix, so that is what I have always done. I use only 1/2 cup of butter and add the nuts to the top. I have tried to hide these from myself by putting them in the freezer, only to dicover they are really really good that way. Cut these small because they are super rich and super sweet.

Amazing. I cannot believe how tasty these gooey and nutty brownies turned out. I love it! Rather simple recipe that anyone can make. Patience is key when melting the caramel...it took 15-20 minutes over very low heat, as I didn't want to risk ruining it. A big hit with the coworkers--I didn't, and wouldn't, change a thing!

I like the fact that this recipe used a cake mix and not a brownie mix. I live overseas and many people send me cake mixes but no brownie mix! I used sweetened condensed milk instead of melting caramels, and they were great!I added nuts before the caramel to keep them locked inside. I never go by a suggested time I always watch carefully with a new recipe, this one does take a bit longer than suggested. Thanks for the recipe! I am sharing it tonight with friends from Bulgaria!OK today I am changing to 5 stars, these set up and taste like fudge, everyone raved!

These are by far the best brownies I have ever attempted to make.  For being the worst cook/baker, they made me look like an gourmet chef.
I baked these brownies for a good friend when he went away to another state, and all of his family absolutely loved them.
I give this recipe 6 out of 5 stars.

I've made these a dozen or so times and they're so good!  The caramel layer is a little too gooey to mail well or to take into work, so I made a couple modifications to make them less messy (and more mail-able and/or transportable).  First, add slightly less than 1/3 c evaporated milk to the caramel layer.  Second, after you pour the caramel mixture on top of the chocolate chips, wait about a minute and then spread around gently (very gently!) with a spoon.  This mixes the chocolate and the caramel together, which I think tastes better, and then when the brownies are cooled, the chocolate (which is firm at room temperature compared to the caramels which are runny) will help keep the middle layer less gooey.

A friend of mine gave me a recipe very similiar to this, except we used a half cup of softned butter and cut it into the cake mix with a pastry blender.  Also, we dropped the remaining cake batter by the spoonfuls over the top, we did not evenly spread it, the appearance is quite nice, it gives the top of the brownies a swirled look.  I had them at a party--their gone!!  I think the work is definitely worth it, I can't wait to try them chilled!

Lord have mercy, these brownies are RICH!!!   I was a little surprised at how thick the batter wound up being, and it took more than half of it to cover the bottom of my pan.   When it came time to cover the chocolate chips and caramel layer with the last of the batter I wound up having to thin it a bit with some water.    They got rave reviews at the dinner party I took them to.

This turned out pretty dry and crumbly for me.  I suspect it was my fault; I should have added more butter (I used about 1/3 cup, since I saw a lot of reviews recommending to cut down the butter to anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup) and I should have cut down on the stated baking time.
My advice: make sure not to overbake and feel free to use as much butter as you want!  :)

Got milk?  These are similar to a recipe my mom used to make.  She'd make them to give away, but we'd keep the edges.  Somehow we didn't think we were eating as much if we ate only the edges.  I swapped a Devil's food cake mix for the GC and I forgot to bake the first layer and did it all at once.  Still great and even better the second day.  I might try a little less butter next time b/c they seemed a little greasy, but, oh my, these are good!!

very yummy, all the men folk loved it! personally, I think I would have added some raw caramel chunks to the second layer to add a little more variety in texture. Swirl some melted caramel up top to make it pretty :o)

These are fantastic.  We made them multiple times throughout the holidays -- my kids kept asking for them.  Extra benefit is that there are no eggs, good for those with allergies.

OMG! These are so amazing! It actually didn't take me as long as some other people to melt the caramel. But I did use a large pan which distributes the heat over a larger area so maybe that's why it melted faster. I brought them to work and everybody said they were KILLER delicious!! I wouldn't change a thing!

I made these for my Christmas dessert baskets last year and they were a big hit. I omitted the nuts since most of my family and friends are not a big fan of them. They only thing I suggest is seriously spray the pan or butter/flour because that caramel will definitely stick! Very good and simple!

I don't think the baking time is correct on these.  Mine turned out like bricks.  I even kept an eye on them to make sure I didn't overcook them, but they still looked gooey when I took them out, so I thought they would be okay.  The flavor is all right.  Kind of sweet & not real brownie-like.  I used pecans instead of walnuts for a more turtle brownie flavor, but they were not all that great.  I doubt I will make them again.

This was a great recipe! The German chocolate mix added a very slight salty flavor that really complimented the caramel layer. I even messed up on the cake mix and used 1/2 cup of evaporate milk, but it still came out delicious.

They were good but too over the top sweet for me.  They were better the second day but still a little gritty with sugar.  Maybe a brownie mix instead of cake would have been better.  My co-workers loved them.

Very good! It was a little hard to spread the batter, but well worth it. I did do the first baking with caramel and chocolate, as suggested, and it came out delicious.

AWESOME AWESOME brownies!!!  The BEST!  I got sooooo many compliments of these, & was asked to make them again!  I left out the chocolate chips, because I thought it would make them too rich, but I actually MAY try them WITH them next time!  I think it would help them to set up better, although they were STILL VERY tasty withOUT the chips!!!  YUMMY YUMMY recipe!  RECOMMEND IT TO ALL!!!!!!

Very good, make sure to try and not get the caramel filling on the side of the pan if you can... it is hard to scoop the brownies out if you are not careful!  VERY TASTY!

These brownies were so awesome. They just needed about 25-30 mintues longer in the oven than the recipe called for but once they were fulley cooked they were out of this world! If you like caramel these will be your favorite brownies ever!

I made the brownies in a 9x9 inch pan, so they were thicker.  They turned out great!  You definitly have to wait a few hours to cut them, but they are worth the wait!  I will make this again and again!

REALLY yummy and SUPER rich! Don't make these if you're on a diet...I don't care how much willpower you SAY you have! I made this for my sister's friends and my mum's coworkers...THEY LOVED 'EM! One thing though: there's gotta be an easier way to get the caramel sauce...maybe I'll try buying a jar of it next time...

too sweet, and the cake mix really tasted "artificial" you could tell they were not from scratch. My boyfriend and his co workers liked them that's why I gave them a three.

This recipe is absolutely divine! I have made it for 2 events and have gotten rave reviews at each! It's delicious still warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! I would recommend using a double boiler for the caramel so that it doesn't cook too quickly. YUM!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  I love, love these brownies.  This was downright sinful!!!  The only alteration is that I did not have German Chocolates cake mix so I replaced it with Devil Food Chocolate cake mix.  Holy  was this good.

Big hit!  I suggest flattening the top layer into "disks," as others suggested.  It was SO much easier to work with.  Just a little pressing here and there made the top layer completely cover the other layers.  I left off the nuts because I wasn't sure if my crowd ate them - was still great!  Thanks for the recipe!

These brownies got rave reviews! I followed others advice and cut down on the butter, and made flat dough circles to cover the top.  That really helped because the dough was so thick.  Also, I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated so that the brownies did not fall apart.  They were excellent, we microwaved them to get the caramel warm and melty (about 25 seconds) then served w/ vanilla ice cream... they were incredible!!!

These brownies were great! I love caramel and would even add more next time around. I do agree with another user that the butter should be halved. In fact, I used only a stick and they were still a bit heavy. Overall, a chocaholic's dream!

These were terrible! I followed the recipe exactly as written. They burned around the edges and were still completely underdone in the center. The few that were usable in the middle of the pan were greasy and heavy. A real disappointment. Don't know how it got all those rave reviews. Will not make again...will probably trash the few I salvaged from the middle of the pan.

These are increadably sweet and rich brownies.  I made these for a get together, along with 4 other desserts, and I was one of the only ones to eat them, they don't have sweet tooths.  For those who have a Sweet tooth these are for you, other wise you will not like them.  They are very easy to make.  I did not use a double boiler.  I just microwaved the caramels.  I did not use nuts, they aren't needed!!!

As noted by other reviewers, it looked very undercooked when it came out of the oven, and I still think it could've gone another 5-10 minutes in the oven. Even after cooling, they are still very messy and undercooked. The taste is very rich and good, but they are difficult to eat.

I love making these brownies!  Even my friends that hate brownies love these!  They are much easier to make with Kraft Caramel Bites instead of unwrapping all the individual caramels.  Do not try to use caramel sauce.....it doesn't work.  :-)  I have also left out the walnuts for my non-nut loving friends and they are just as good!

I love these, they are the same thing my mom and grandma have made at Christmas each year since I was young. We called them something different, but I looked at the old recipe it is the same. I use a whole bag of chocolate chips - why not! Otherwise I make it as stated.

This is the exact recipe I have been using for the last 35 years. Always a hit. Never any left. They seem to turn out better if you use the mini chocolate chips. If you don't have any chocolate chips, you can use Hershey syrup. Don't use a lot though as they will turn out very gooey. Still very good.

I took these to school for a teacher treat day and they were gobbled up.  The recipe was requested by many.  I did have to cook them longer than receipe stated.  Very delicious and easy.

I read this recipe, and was excited to try them. Sorry, but I didn't like the taste and I didn't like the texture.  My brownie loving gang didn't like them.  The idea was good, but taste-no.

I didn't change a single thing about this recipe.  It was fabulous!!!  When I was making it, I thought there was no way the small amount of batter was going to fill up the 11x8 pan I used, it just didn't seem like there was anything there but the batter spreads out quite nicely and next time I'll probably use the larger pan to be on the safe side and prevent a possible mess.  Best brownies I've ever eaten.  Very similar to TGIF's brownie obsession dessert.

So yummy!!  I used half and half in place of the evap. milk, and I left out the nuts, but this was amazing and I'm not usually a fan of brownies.  Not too chocolatey and just the right amount of caramel to be heavenly!

I substituted butterscotch chips for the caramel candy.  They are totally delicious!!!  The best part is dropping the remaining batter over the top.

I Love this recipe!! Our family for years have been making this recipe. We call them Killer Brownies. When I lost the written recipe, I was in a panic. It was so nice to find it. I baked mine for an additional 5 minutes. And waiting for them to cool down so you can cut them is never easy. But these still don't last at any party I take them to.

OMG, Wowie!  Soooooo good!  I was worried at first that the German Choc Cake mix wasn't going to be sweet enough for my taste, but with the caramel and choc chips, wow, I can't imagine them any sweeter!  I took another reviewers suggestion to microwave the caramels and evaporated milk.  3 mins was right on!  I think I doubled the choc chips.  These are sooooo good, I will definitely bake them again!  ;-)

Ok, I usually am the last person to respond to anyone's recipe review, but, I couldn't help myself this time!!!  In response to the review that stated the brownies were "mush", any baking instructions ALWAYS state that "oven temps may vary"!!!!  I have made these brownies numerous times, and, I still don't follow the baking times to a tee.  I just use them as a basic guideline.  But, anyways, these brownies are a HUGE hit whenever I make them.  In fact, every time my son and his friends take a "roadtrip", these brownies are a requirement!!!

I am a very novice baker and this recipe turned out AMAZING!!! Took it to my family picnic and they were completely gone! It was super easy to make. Usually I find a way to ruin a recipe (I can't make non-gooey nobakes for the LIFE of me!) but this turned out better than ever. Followed it exactly. The person before me had to have messed up something major for it to ont work. I recommened this over any recipe on this site for picnics because you cant go wrong with brownies!!!! ESPECIALLY THESE ONES!!!!

These are SOOOOO good. This will definitely be my staple brownie recipe. I love them. They are great with icecream, and are super rich. I didn't put the nuts in, because i'm not a fan of nuts in brownies.

Great brownies! Made exactly as recipe said except substituted pecan halves for walnut pieces. My husband is a serious caramel brownie lover and said these were some of the best he'd ever had. The caramel actually stays gooey in the middle instead of getting hard and chewy by the next day like some recipes. One thing, do not bake any longer than recommended, 20 min max 2nd bake time. Next time I may even take mine out after 15 min for a little softer brownies.

I followed this recipe exactly but just was not impressed with the result. They were so gooey that they were almost impossible to get out of the pan, and I did grease the pan and let them cool completely. I'm not sure if they were done and I cooked them 5 minutes longer than the recipe said to. They were also just way too sweet. I won't make these again.

These are really good!! I followed the recipe exactly as indicated, except I did not put nuts in. The batter is kind of hard to spread on the bottom, but not too bad. I think the addition of the chocolate chips totally takes this recipe to another level. I do wonder if they would be better with a brownie mix rather than a cake mix, so I might try that next time. But overall, these were really good and I got a lot of compliments!

Made these for a potluck dinner where I met a lot of people for the first time.  Now that's all they associate me with.  "the guy that brought the caramel brownies".  Yes, believe all the reviews, they are really that good.  I was a little unsure what to do with the remaining batter which was to go on top of the caramel because it was too thick to pour on.  So I just crumbed it up evening on top and they turned out perfect.  Had to cook them for a lot longer than the recipe called for but just kept an eye on them (and a toothpick) until they were done.

Made these last night and they are even better than I remember. LOVE them.  Used recipe exactly as written and was perfect.  Be sure to allow to fully cool (over an hour) before trying to cut and make sure to cut into small pieces because they are so rich.

These are very good tasting, especially if you like very rich, sweet desserts.  My kids devoured them.  I just took a teaspoon and dolloped the second half of the brownie batter on top.  I think I will try reducing the butter next time.  One thing I would advise is to definitely not try to cut these until they are cool.  If you can't wait 2 or 3 hours, then I would chill them in the fridge before cutting.

Very good. I didn't have a German 
chocolate cake mix, so I used a Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix that I already had in the house. Really rich. I think that I will use a mix not so rich or leave out the Chocolate chips. I layered the nuts in with the carmels as suggested in one of the reviews, turned out well and the carmel was not runny. Thanks Sandee

This came out awesome. Recipie was very simple, followed exactly and they came out perfect. My husband and office loved them - even the ones who didn't like brownies. I was told they were the best brownies ever!

very good...I too reduced the butter to 1/2 cup.  I didnt bake the bottom layer, I only pressed it in, drizzled about 3/4 c. carmel ice cream topping, then I added the chocolate chips and nuts to the remaining dough and sprinkled it over the top.  baked for 25-30 mins.
I also chilled them for easier serving =)
thanks for the recipe!

This is the first caramel brownie recipe I have tried.  I followed the recipe closely but just varied it with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  My husband really liked them and took them to work to proudly share.  I thought they looked great and tasted even better.  The caramel unwrapping and melting was probably the most tedious part of the recipe.  I did take others advice and flattened the top brownie layer into discs so I did not have to spread the thick batter over the caramel layer.  I just wonder if the results would have been just as good using a more no fuss caramel sauce in the middle like some other recipes I have read called for - I guess I will just have to try and see!  All I know is I will definitely be making this recipe again.

These are a little bit of a pain to make (unwrapping all the caramels, and trying to spread a very thick brownie batter on top of caramel) but they're worth it.  Best brownie recipe I've found, and my co-workers are constantly asking me to make them.

These are good.  I was a little concerned because the batter was thick, but it turned out just fine.  I only used 1/2 cup butter and used about 1/2 cup water to thin the batter a bit.  I did taste the cake mix, and I am a big homemade brownie person so I just might try this with my own brownie recipe next time.  Tasty caramel swirl, though!  Hershey's caramels are the best quality to use, in my opinion!

This is the recipe that garnered me a 'reputation' with my husband's co-workers.  I made it once and now, everytime they have a work function, they beg my husband to bring it again.  They all think I am some kind of fabulous cook and I will not be setting them straight anytime soon.  Thank goodness for Allrecipes!  This one is a diet buster but oh so good!

Really good! I omitted the nuts, you never know who likes em.. I used semi sweet chips (milk chocolate seemed too sweet). And I took another users advice and flattened disks of dough between my hands for the top layer. These were soooo great! Everyone loved them.. I might never use another recipe!

My husband is a brownie lover and he is really enjoying them. I like them too!
They are pretty close to the ones my grandmother makes. (Her name of her recipe is "Frownies")
I only used 1/2c butter and they still turned out a little greasy for my taste. Next time I will use 1/4c and see how that works. I also took another reviewer's advice and patted down the dough on the top layer to create flat discs. It worked beautifully. The other alteration I made was to sprinkle the nuts into the middle with the chocolate chips (I used milk choc) instead of into the cake mix. We used chopped pecans and I only used 1/4c. Just right for us! 
Thanks Sandee for the great directions.

I already have the same recipe and have made this MANY times.  It's awesome.  The only things I do differently are to use slivered almonds instead of walnuts as well as a dark chocolate cake mix.

WOW!!  These were wonderful!  I made them once and had to make them three more times in one week!  They were a huge hit with kids and adults...I gave out the recipe several times.  So yummy and worth the extra effort that the box doesn't require!  GREAT!!

SOOOOO  good!   I even overcooked the caramel a little and it became kind of grainy with burnt bits, but I used it anyway, and they were simply amazing!!

We have a similar recipe in my family, and it has always been a favorite. Hershey makes a caramel candy that has chocolate creme in the middle, and I like to substitute these for half of the regular caramels. I also prefer milk chocolate chips, but that's just me! Have plenty of ice-cold milk on hand when you serve these! Yum!

These are fabulous! Can't say enough about how easy and delicious they are. They are extremely rich and taste like they came from a gourmet bakery. My highest praise for these!

The batter did not spread easily.  The timing and temperature was all wrong.  I didn't like it at all.  sorry

It's a downright SIN how good these are. Directions needed no alterations, either. Thanks, Sandee, for a perfect recipe. We're brownie fanatics and these are the best we've ever had.

I made these for a party and they were quite popular.  Very moist and gooey.
