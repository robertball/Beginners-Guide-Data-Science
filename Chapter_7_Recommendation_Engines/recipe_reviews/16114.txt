Kinda spicy for the kids with the peppers, but a nice, easy quick one skillet-meal. Will probably add some chicken next time too.

Husband & I both loved it!  I used spicey sausage & added some chili powder also.  It was even better when reheated for lunch! Also sprinkled cheddar on top before serving.

I fried ahead of time as well and added cheese as others have noted.
Next time I will add more rice.

I can only rate this a 4 because it was too spicy for the kids and husband. But, I LOVED it! I cooked the sausage though, following others suggestions. It turned out great!

I thought this was very good!  I used Tomato Basil Rice by Uncle Bens and mild sausage that I my Uncle gave me.  The sausage is mild and doesnt produce any oil! I have no idea what its called. I cooked the sausage on low with the peppers, onions and celery.  Quick and Easy!  Can't ask for more!

My husband and I loved this dish, although it was too spicy for my toddler. I highly recommend frying the sausage first, then draining it and lightly rinsing it to remove extra fat and salt. Otherwise, we both agreed that this is a keeper. Try topping with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar and serve cornbread with honey butter.

this was really nice, i used it as a bouncing off place, & made what is known as valencian winter paella.  but i used this as a base & it was very helpful, & a great entry into a winter paella.  i didn't use snails (dh hates them) or rabbit, used a large pork chop, 2 chicken thighs, 2 breasts, moroccan sausages & spanish sausages from our local butcher.  i used rosemary to give it that smoky flavour along with spanish paprika, & of course garlic, a couple bulbs, chilis & 3 red peppers, 2 orange peppers.  i used a jar of charred peppers, artichokes, & a handful of sundried tomatoes. to begin,  i made my own bed of tomatoes & fresh veggies: tomatoes, cherry mostly, celery, including leaves, parsley, cilantro, including stems finely chopped, carrots, onions, a bulb of garlic, turmeric, spanish paprika, hot chilis, red peppers, some rosemary, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, a hit of tomato paste, worchestershire...once that was essentially a paste i began.  browned the meat: sausages, chopped, next the pork chop, chicken thighs, tits, set that aside while i charred 4 tomatoes quartered, & then browned 4 potatoes, quartered & nuked a bit in the oil left from browning the meat & the tomato juices.  removed the potatoes, added wine deglazed the pan, added the rice, bompi, softened it for some minutes, added the meat, another garlic bulb, put the tomatoes, peppers, a jar of charred red peppers, a few sun dried tomatoes, artichokes around the meat, sprinkled green peas, corn, & green beans

If you're comparing this to jambalaya, you're making jambalaya wrong. The recipe is good. It could be better, but it's good. What would make it better: ditch the rice mix and use real rice, garlic, and seasonings, add a little whole fennel seeds, and add a lot of smoked paprika. Or ground chipotle pepper. Yes, I know, chipotle isn't Spanish. But it does combine smoky flavor with mild pepper heat, so two birds, one stone.

I made this two days ago and it is still good. Minor changes were left out olives. Used 1/2 Andouille sausage and 1/2 regular smoked sausage, added a cup more rice and used 2 cups of chicken broth to compensate for the rice I added. Still used written amount of water.
Turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing

We all liked this. I wasn't sure if I would like the green olives in it, as I normally don't use them in cooking. I was going to use black olives instead but decided to give the green a try - and it was great! I did cut my sausage into quarters and fried it with the bell pepper, celery and onions. My boyfriend said he would like me to make it with shrimp added in next time. :)

My husband loved this.  A new and easy way to make summer sausage.  I left out the green olives and substituted black olives.

Tastes similar to jumbalaya, and isn't
that much quicker to make.  Would rather
have the real stuff.

Maybe a little too spicy for small children, the teenager in my house loves it.
