this was very good! it was absolutely perfect for a cold winter night. the only thing i did differently was pull rotisserie chicken, which probably helped add a lot of flavor as it was lemon-peppered. i also added a little salt and pepper to the vegetables when cooking them over oil. i loved it!

Hubby & kids liked it, definitely on the rotation. I added some garlic and a dash of Worcester sauce (I don't usually change a recipe I rate but this was just a bit bland for me).

It was ok, kind of bland tasting for me when initially made. So I changed it up a bit-I used precooked chicken strips found in deli aisle (for nites when I REALLY need a quick meal), which saved me a step. I cooked the carrots in pan so I didn't have to boil as long, with onions and some spices (garlic pepper, basil, various ones from the cabinet I experimented with), then I boiled in chicken broth. Before carrots got too tender I added more frozen veggies (broccoli, corn), the chicken, and the tortellini. I added a bit more cornstarc/water mixture to make it a bit thicker.  It helped, but I want to try to make more of a cream sauce with this recipe as the backbone next time.

This was incredibly easy and actually very good.  The tortellini have delicious flavor after being cooked in the broth.  One modification I did was boiling the chicken breast instead of frying it.  Then I shred it and put it in the soup.  I also used corn in the place of green beans which I just threw in the broth as well.  I would recommend this for sure!

Good pasta, chicken and vegetable combo, but thought it was too bland.

GREAT recipe.  I've made it often, especially as a way to use leftovers from a roasted chicken.  If I don't have tortellini on hand, I've substituted whole wheat couscous.  It's a very different, but a nice change.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe that can be modified to your taste, what you have fresh at the time. I usually add fresh carrots, celery and peas to mine as well as shirmp. I have also used both dried and fresh parsley and both are fine. I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it more healthy. Double or Triple the recipe most of the time to freeze, which it does beautifully. Thanks for adding, we all LOVE this soup.

This is a very good, basic recipe. I made several changes to the original recipe - that's why I didn't rate it higher. I saut√©ed the chicken in olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper. I added garlic, celery and mushrooms to the veggies. I added Italian seasoning with the chicken broth and I cooked the veggies for a bit to soften them before I added the chicken and the tortellini. I thickened the soup with whole milk and cornstarch, instead of water. With these changes, it was awesome. Next time, I'd probably omit the green beans and add spinach instead.

I did make some changes.  I used 2cups of chicken, carrots and green beans.   Also used 4 cups of low sodium chicken stock and 4 cups of no sodium chicken stock.   Also added a bunch of Kale.  My family loved it.

This is a very light and tasty stew. I made very few modifications. I added 1 stalk celery, 1 clove garlic to the veggies and rounded the onion to a whole cup. I added some Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to the broth and let all that simmer on low, covered for about an hour. (My veggies were still pretty crunchy before I added the broth.) I substituted 2 lbs refrigerated tortellini for the dry. I let the tortellini and corn starch simmer on low until tortellini was done, then added a little whole cream (about 2-3 Tbsp) after it had finished simmering completely, as you never want to boil cream. Delicious. Served with salad and garlic bread sticks. Also a big hit with the kids. The stew was their favorite thing. Bonus points!
