I do not like black licorice, but I really enjoy the crisp, subtle anise flavor of fresh fennel.  Roasting the fennel in this manner mellows and sweetens the flavor even more.  It was unclear to me if the fennel pieces should be completely separated, so I paid close attention to the roasting time with my individual pieces.  While the fennel was roasting, I marinated the beans in the lemon vinaigrette.  This dish is a bit salty, but I am partial to salty foods, so I liked it very much.  (Although next time I might tone down the salt; I used my own Greek seasoning which already has salt in it.)  I did not have any salad greens, so I used red, ripe tomatoes in this and liked the flavor they added, although it could be argued that they overwhelm the fennel.  Next time I'll do the salad greens.  I also omitted the parmesan in favor of sprinkling crumbled Israeli feta ontop.  This is a wonderful complement to grilled lemon chicken and I think it will be a summer salad staple this year!

This is SO delicious. The roasting absolutely mellows the sharp licorice flavor, and the garlic and Greek seasoning compliment everything perfectly. I actually prefer it without the Parmesan - it just doesn't need any additional flavors, imo. I would not hesitate in making this again - especially for guests. Thanks so much!

This salad had a good flavor.  I don't know about other cooks, but I don't have a lot of experience roasting a fennel bulb.  Additional instructions on handling the fennel would have been helpful.  I probably won't make again.

This was delicious!  I made it while my husband was out of town, he tends to not like unusual vegetables.  However, I think I can say that this will be one that I will make when he is at home.  The fennel flavor was very mild and yummy.  It was fantastic as is, but, was equally delicious without the lettuce.
Absolutely my next dinner or side that needs to impress.  It plated beautifully.

I was looking for ways to use fennel, and this was really good.  Instead of Greek seasoning, I used fresh oregano and thyme from my herb garden.
