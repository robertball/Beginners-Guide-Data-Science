I made this for Easter and it was a hit with the family.  I did adapt the recipe according to what others have suggested.  I used two 29-oz cans of cut sweet potatoes instead of cooking my own.  I substitued evaporated milk for the regular milk and I think it made it more creamy.  I used dark brown sugar for the white sugar and I cut that back to 3/4 cup since others said 1 cup made it too sweet.  I upped the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I was going to add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. salt to the mixture but I forgot until it was too late.  But I did manage to get a sprinkling of cinnamon on the casserole before I put the topping on.  I made a double batch of the topping and baked it all in a 9 x 13 pan.  It was fantastic!

This was delicious. I tried it a few days before Thanksgiving and even my husband (who will never eat sweet potatoes) asked for me to make again it for Thanksgiving dinner!!!  You need about 5 or 6 medium sweet potatoes to get 4 1/2 cups mashed.  I made a few adjustments the second time I made it and it was even better.  1.) used 1/3 cup evaporated milk instead of regular  2) seasoned potato mixture with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

I have made a recipe similar to this one for several years. One of my best recipes. I use real maple syrup instead of white sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes and don't use flour in the topping. You may want to double the topping. Very yummy. Tastes great warmed up but doesn't look as pretty. You can make it ahead of time but keep the topping separate until ready to bake.

I noticed this receipe and just had to comment. It has been in our family for years. We always have it during the holidays and even our daughters in-laws ask her to bring it. The only difference I noticed is that I usually use canned sweet potatoes (one large and one small) this way it is always on hand. Also, I place the pecans on top first then add the flour, brown sugar mixture on top. I melt the margarine and drizzle on top of this mixture. Does not need to completely cover as it will flow over areas not covered as it cooks. It is a receipe that I have had for about 30 years from my mother-in-law and now my daughter makes it also for her in-laws. It is great!!!!

This is a great recipe, except for the fact that the directions are not set up to correctly to properly make this item right.  Such as the butter, one part you melt it, the other part you don't, but it doesn't state that in the recipe on which.

Everyone loved this dish at my Christmas dinner.  It was not too sweet had just the right texture.  I roasted the potatoes in the oven (instead of boiling; it's easier and they are more flavorful) and made 1 1/2 times the topping.  Be sure to use a shallow baking dish as it will take much longer to bake if you don't. Great recipe and Thanks!

My family has the traditional Italian Christmas so I thought I throw the family off and bring this casserole.  My father is a big major food critic in our family and he loved it.  My mom is a sweet potato lover and will basically eat them just plainly baked.  My family never really had this before so it was great new addition.  Since we have American additions to our family through marriage we had to tweak our Christmas dinner.  This recipe is awesome & the kids love it!  I am a new lover of sweet potatoes & I wanted to try to make a casserole so I did this receipe.  It turned out great however the pecan streusal was way too much so next time I think I will half it and use it sparingly, I also think this would just be great with the marshmallows on top or even by itself.  But the marshmallows is always good presentation.  I also used a half cup of sugar which was plenty of sugar for it and I used a tad bit more of vanilla.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.  The sweet potato part was creamy, perfectly sweetened with the half cup of sugar and it was fluffy and light.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!

This is easy to make and a huge holiday hit! In fact I made it Christmas morning this year and it took about 20 minutes.   I use half of the white and half of the brown sugar the recipe calls for and it is sweet enough for us. The only trouble I have is estimating how many potatoes
is equal to 4 1/2 cups.  I buy 5-7 sweet potatoes depending on size and am usually in the 4 1/2 -5 1/2 cup range in the end.  I highly recommend giving this one a try!

Used canned sweet potatoes and reduced the amount of white sugar to compensate for the syrup. Loved the crunchy topping.

I found this recipe looking to break the traditional marshmallow/sweet potato combo. I pulled this off Thanksgiving.com and WOW, it was a huge hit. My husband's family couldn't get enough! My sister-in-law asked me for the recipe and is making it this year as a side with Christmas dinner.
MAKE IT WITH FRESH SWEET POTATOES ONLY! It's great.

Updated Review - 
I made these last night for a work potluck.  Didnt have the time to bake the sweet potatoes, so I used canned.  Everyone is raving about the dish! So if you're crunched for time...Canned works!!!
If youre baking your sweet potatoes - 1 1/2 hour at 350 degrees..wrapped in heavy duty foil!!  Baking retains the flavor and the skins come off so easily!  I modified the recipe a little: 4 cups of mashed sweet potatoes (4 large yams ive found = about 4 cups) (If you're using canned - 2 29oz cans + 1 smaller can (I believe its 16oz?), 1/3 cup of condensed milk, 2 eggs beaten, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp cinnamon. 
The used the same ingredients and ratios for the topping.  Baked in 2 pyrex baking dishes at 400 degrees for 30 mins.  SUPER TASTY!!  :)

I have had this recipe for years and everyone is always impressed with this dish.  The one thing that I think makes a big difference in texture is to use a food processor when mixing the sweet potatoes with butter, milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Boil whole unpeeled sweet potatoes for about 45 minutes.  Drain, cool, and then peel off the skins.  Put these potatoes in a food processor with the other ingredents and blend until very smooth and well combined.  You will have to do this in two separate batches (dividing other ingredients equally between the two batches) and stir them together when all is processed.  Will make this casserole even better, fluffier, and smoother.  A definate winner!

This recipe is nearly identical to the one I have been making for about 15 years.  It is the only sweet potato dish I will eat.  My recipe varies slightly in that it uses 32 oz canned-drained yams, has 1/2 cup white sugar (so you can successfully reduce that) and many years ago I began eliminating the butter from the sweet potatoes and we actually like it much better, its fluffy and delicious that way (and less calories).  You MUST however have the butter in the topping.  I also bake for 45 minutes because we like it nice and bubbly.  This is the best sweet potatoes you'll ever have, the topping is exceptional and it is not  Thanksgiving without this dish it is a family tradition.

With all the great reviews, I had to try this. Adjusted the servings to 2 and the measurements automatically adjusts. I made this small serving to test the recipe. 

I used 1/2 the sugars (white/brown), You can try more - pour the sugar slowly so you can taste to sweeten as you like.  I doubled the vanilla extract, added the 1-teaspoon cinnamon, and (didn’t have nutmeg to add If I did I'd include it), 1-Tablespoon dark syrup. I baked one big yam about 1 hr. and the peel off was easy. Followed directions as written, used elec. mixture to combine the yam and other mixtures.

IMPORTANT: The white sugar is for potato mixture; the brown sugar is for the topping. It doesn't specify this in the recipe.  The topping is the other half of listed ingredients of recipe.

For the topping, I doubled the nuts. Used walnuts, finely chopped (would have preferred pecans if I had them). ALSO followed JOAN FOX's advice on the topping – “1) place the pecans on top first then 2) add the flour, brown sugar mixture on top. 3) Melt the butter/margarine and drizzle on top of this mixture. Does not need to completely cover, as it will flow over areas not covered as it cooks.” Due to this small serving for 2, I used a regular round cake-baking pan, which was perfect.  RESULTS: Baked all for 30 minutes.  Topping came out perfect and crunchy, sweetness was fine.  Not too sweet, not too bland. Sweet yam came out light, fluffy.  Divinely delicious and this little baked serving is all for me!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews from everyone.  I told my husband, who doesn't like sweet potatoes, that he had to try it because someone else posted about her husband eating three helpings even though he didn't like sweet potatoes either.  Sure enough, he loved it!

I did make a few changes:  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the 1 cup white sugar, margarine instead of butter and yams because sweet potatoes are hard to come by around here.

I have already been requested to bring this dish to my in-laws' for Christmas dinner, and my husband told me I could make it once a week at our house.

I took the advice of other people and added the sugar slowly to the sweet potato mixture, tasting each time.  I ended up adding much less than the recipe called for, and adding less sugar balanced out the super-sweet topping.  People at the party were asking me for the recipe all night!

My extended family always joins us for Easter dinner, and this is always on my table!  I have been using this recipe for years, and have tweaked it just a bit.  I use heavy cream instead of milk for a richer consistency.  I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and up the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I also like to place a few pecan halves on top of the pecan mixture for a pretty presentation.  I have also made this dish with a lower fat content by substituting light margarine for the butter, 2% milk for the milk or cream and used 4 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs.  Not as rich and still delicious for those times when I'm feeling more health conscious.  I have read a few reviews that added mini marshmallows.  May try that this year!

Yummy! This is definitely a keeper. Per others' comments, I used less sugar (3/4 cup) and more vanilla (1 tsp total). Doubling the topping is a must! I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon. This was my first time making a sweet potato casserole and it was a HUGE hit with all my guests.

This was the best sweet potatoes I have ever made.  I tripled the recipe for a baby shower and the entire pan was gone.  I roasted the potatoes the night before in the oven at 400 degrees for about an hour.  In the morning, I peeled them and it was so easy.  I will make this casserole every year for the holidays.

Absolutely great!  Tweak it if you want, but it's really wonderful as is.  Ideas:  adding autumn spices to the brown sugar mix, using heavy cream instead of milk, or using all brown sugar and no white sugar.  But you really don't need to change a thing.  One note:  cool your sweet potatoes prior to adding the eggs.  It is possible to slightly cook the eggs in super hot sweet potatoes, and that would not be good (think bits of scrambled eggs in your casserole--ick!).

I tried this dish on yesterday for my Thanksgiving feast and it was absolutely wonderful and very tasteful. But I did add 1/2 of teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg because sweet potatoes just doesn't seem right without. But anyhow two-thumbs up for this recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year; I HATE the sweet potato/yam casseroles with marshmallows, so I was excited to try this one...sooooo glad I did!  It was delicious, and every one of my 16 guests gobbled it up.  I followed the recipe exactly, and baked my sweet potatoes in the oven for about an hour and a half before mashing them.  I made the topping and mashed the potatoes a day ahead of time, and then just assembled everything and baked right before dinner.  Delicious!!!

The same recipe my aunt uses who always gets asked to bring her casserole to Thanksgiving get to gethers.  She uses 4 large cans of sweet potatos instead of fresh and oh, it is perfect!

I made this last year for Christmas dinner and everyone liked it.  It's okay to use canned potatoes.  Don't waste your time boiling sweet potatoes.

We just celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday and I last minute tried this recipe. Wow! It was a hit. The pecan topping is wonderful. Being a diabetic I had a taste, and I was in heaven. I made this dish 5 hours before dinner and 30 minutes before dinner, I reheated this at 350 for 30 minutes covered with foil, the last 5 minutes I took the foil off to get the crunchiness. Yumm. This will be my annual dish. Many thanks.:-)

This is delicious!  I would make a little less topping next time. Also, I followed the advice of some other reviewers and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for the 1 cup white sugar, and then added a little white sugar after tasting it. With the topping it is plenty sweet.  I also added a tsp of nutmeg and a tsp of cinnamon. Great recipe!

This was soooo good! My 2 yr old and mom were especially crazy about this casserole.  What's funny is that I actually used canned sweet potatoes (2 29oz cans). Also, instead of pecans, I added marshmallows to the top. Yummy!

Just fixed this for Easter dinner.  I am a major sweet potato fan and this is by far the absolute best I've ever tasted. Next time I'll cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. It will be sweet enough I'm sure.  The crumb topping is fabulous.  Pecans definitely set his off nicely.Everyone and I mean everyone came back for seconds on this one.  I doubled the recipe.  Thank goodness there are some leftovers!

My husband and I are on a special diet, so I didn't add the topping and used Splenda instead of the sugar and it was still delicious.  I used about 1 tablespoon of molasses to give it a brown sugar flavor.  I guess the butter flavor (which I probably should have left out or at least have decreased but didn't) came through and made this dish just scrumptious even without the topping.  Will definitely make again--not too often because of the calories, but maybe for the holidays--with the topping.  Oh diet, I must not betray thee (too often).

This is the best sweet casserole I have ever had! A few things I had to change... I ran out of brown sugar... so I just didn't make the topping... and I only used 1/2 cup of pecans and mixed those all together with the casserole before I put it in the oven. My husband tried it and he said they were amazing and he forbids me trying the topping next time! The amount of pecans I used was perfect... and the casserole tasted amazing!

Amazing.  I baked fresh sweet potatoes and used those.  I halved the amount of sugar and used panela (whole cane sugar) instead.  It gave it a warmer taste.  I made this for a party I had this Christmas and there was none left over!

I made this last minute for a weekend dinner and it was amazing. It was a nice change from the traditional sweet potatoes with marshmallows you usually see. Even the kids who stray away from sweet potato's loved it. I will definitely make this again and it was very easy to make.

Excellent recipe! I used fresh sweet potatoes (two large ones will yield 4 1/4 cups when mashed) and reduced the sugar a bit. As suggested in another review, I upped the vanilla to a whole teaspoon, and added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Absolutely delicious!

I like the best of both worlds (fun, yet sophisticated) so I went ahead and made this recipe w/both marshmallow and sugar crumb topping... it was perfect.  I also followed the advice of many on here: increased vanilla to 1tsp & added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg & salt, used evap. milk & all brown sugar and (because I am a busy mom of 4) used 2-40oz cans of sweet potatoes... one of these days I will make this w/the real deal. I have made this w/pecans & without... I prefer without (which suprises me, I usually love them).  I think in the future I will attempt to add oatmeal to the crumb topping. This recipe is always a hit!

This is a miracle worker! I've never liked sweet potatoes (nor has my father). Made these and LOVED them, they are so rich and the topping is heavenly. No more canned potatoes for this group. Can't say enough.  I used 5 sweet potatoes, not yams. Thanks for the keeper!

I made this last night for a Christmas Party at my job and they ate it up!!! It was so good! The only changes I made were to use canned yams (2 large cans) and sweetened condensed milk. Everything else remained the same and it was excellent!!!! I will continue to make this dish

HOLY SMOKES THIS WAS DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly and the result was DELICIOUS! We could not stop eating it. After cleaning our plates my boyfriend and I had several extra heaping fork-fulls right out of the baking-dish. What a GREAT dish, this would be ideal at Thanksgiving! THANK YOU!!!

This has been a "must have" dish at my holiday dinners for many years.  I usually make 1.5x the topping. This recipe says to bake it for 25 minutes, I usually bake it more like 40. I put it in the oven without the topping for about 20 minutes, then take it out, add the topping and bake for about another 20 minutes.

Delicious.  I've made this twice now and will be making again this Thanksgiving.  Only variation was that I decreased the white sugar to 1/2C.  We found it too sweet for our taste with 1C sugar.

I have absolutely never tasted sweet potatoes this delicious in my life.  I made this recipe for Christmas and my family is now demanding I make it again for Easter.  If you even remotely like sweet potatoes you have to try this recipe.  I made everything according to the recipe (I did use cookie nuts - the finely chopped nuts, not just standard chopped nuts because they're easier for children and elderly to eat) and it's incredibly easy, and just amazingly delicous!

This was so yummy, everyone asked for the recipe. For the topping I used walnuts instead of pecans, and covered it with foil for part of the cooking time so that the topping didn't get burned. Definitely all thumbs up over here!

This is a great recipe! I used sweet potatoes and yams for the 4 1/2 cups. The taste was great and it wasn't too sweet. I did make a double batch for the topping and used the evaporated milk instead. I highly recommend this for thanksgiving or any large meal you plan on making! Delicious!

This only get's better the more times you make it. Directions were super easy to follow and I only deviated in not adding nuts becuase my husband is allergic. Regardless, it comes out super yummy and everyone always asks for more!

This is so good, it tasts almost exactly like my moms.  Definantly a keeper.  Like BARBARALB, I used evaporated milk and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used baked sweet potatoes.

This was WAY too sweet for a side dish, in my opinion. It made the dessert taste bland and boring. It tasted like a cross between sweet potato pie and pecan pie. Actually, I think the sweet potato mixture was sweeter than the pie I usually make. It was incredibly yummy of course, but if I make this again, I would definitely cut down the white sugar to a 1/2 cup. We happen to love sweets so we couldn't stop eating it but two cups of sugar is a LOT for a side dish.

I have made this recipe many times now, often during the holiday season. I'm giving it only four stars though because I find it too sweet in its literal incarnation. I usually put in 1/3 cup light brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, and add 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. I also change the composition of the streusel topping to 2/3 light brown sugar, 1/3 flour (keeping the butter and pecan the same). I find this is the perfect sweetness for myself and for guests I have served it to. Some people who like it less sweet can avoid the streusel topping and eat the milder sweet potato cream. Guests usually comment on the "je ne sais quoi" quality of the casserole (it's the vanilla).

These were the BEST sweet potatos I have ever eaten - and I hate sweet potatos.  I accidentally used brown sugar in the potato mixture, but only half a cup and it turned out perfect.  Will definitely be saving this one!

The potato part of this dish was very good, however, I could not get the topping to "crumble." It still was a good standard sweet potato casserole dish.

Very nice side dish that my family loved. I halved the sugar and do to allergies, I used toasted walnuts in lieu of the pecans. Thank you so much Suzanne!

Moist, fluffy and yummy.  HINT:  Taste your sweet potatoes after mashing and adjust added sugar accordingly.  I used less than 1/2 cup.  Baked it in a 2.5 qt. casserole dish and used half the topping.  This is now a Christmas tradition in our home.

Way too sweet!  I made this, following the recipie exactly, and we found it to be much too sweet.  I will make this again because I think I can adjust it, but will cut the topping to 1/4 of the recipie, and cut the sugar mixed into the potatos by at least half.

If you are a sweet, sweet potato fan, you'll probably love it.  Everyone raved about it, but it was too sweet for me.  The topping was like candy.

Made the recipe for the family and there was company too.  They all totally loved it!!  Considering most of them never really ate sweet potato.  The recipe is really delicious... and yes... do put half the sugar required because it will taste awesome regardless!

This could've almost been dessert! Wonderful dish. I made a few changes. I substituted 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup in place of the 1 cup of white sugar. I baked in an 8x8 casserole dish and baked for about 35 minutes. The topping was perfect and crunchy!

I've used this recipe for years. I do find a whole stick to be a little bit much butter to put in the casserole, so I cut that back by half. I also used the baked potato function on the microwave to cook my potatoes and then mash as I would a mashed potato. I also find the evaporated milk to be a great change. I also don't think that 25 minutes is long enough in the oven. That's what my original recipe says too and I just find it is usually too short to get the middle set. My oven cooks fast usually, and this takes at least 50 minutes if not an hour. Just be aware of that the cooking time may be different and get it going with plenty of time, especially since it's easy to keep warm once it's done. Also fabulous reheated...as if you'll have leftovers!

I really liked this receipe. I did make a few adjustments. 

In my mix I added: 
1/2 tsp lemon extract
1 tsp vanilla extract (instead of 1/2 tsp to even out the flavors)
1/2 nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
2 tbs all purpose flour (to add some consistency)
1/3 cup of evaporated milk (not regular)
1 1/2 cup of chopped pecans

For me with the slight adjustments, this dish came out delicious.

I have been making this recipe for five years now (ever since it was first on allrecipes). People don't just request it at Thanksgiving and Christmas, they demand it! One holiday I did not make it and everyone was very upset. I highly recommend this recipe, but once you make it you will never be able to bring anything else to holiday functions :)

This recipe is fantastic!  I did make a couple of changes though: I baked my potatoes (1 hr @ 375) instead of boiling (I try to avoid boiling veggies because you lose a lot of nutrients that way) and I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the potato mixture.  I will probably end up making this for our dessert on thanksgiving.

I loved this recipe ~ so simple and tasty!  I didn't have pecans so I had to leave those out. I did cheat and use canned potatoes and my only suggestion is if you go that route that you be careful that your mixture is thick enough ~ mine was a tiny bit too thin.  I'll definetly use this recipe again & again.

DELICIOUS!  I did cut down on the white sugar and only put in a 1/2 cup and that was sweet enough. I would even say you could get away with 1/3 cup but you can taste it as you mix it in either way.
I didn't have the entire amt of pecan so I added walnuts, which worked but I prefer the pecans in this recipe.
This will be a Thanksgiving staple!

it's hard to tell how much sweet potatoes 4 cups is when you peel and boil them.  i used 4 large ones.

i also used heavy cream instead of milk only because i thought that's what the recipe called for (didn't notice until just now it was supposed to be milk).  

als0, i only dirtied the pot and the final dish.  i mashed and mixed everything into the original pot that i boiled the sweet potatoes in. 

i also tripled the topping as one person suggested, but this was WAY too much; i have tons left over - i think the original recipe toppoing amount would have been fine.

everyone loved this!  another keeper!

This recipe has become a tradition at family gatherings.  While it is very good as originally written, I add a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture to spice it up just a bit.

This recipe was a hit with all my friends.  Even the ones who don't normally eat or like sweet potatoes. The only thing I changed about it was the fact that I didn't want to take the time to peel, cook and mash the pots. So I used canned. Two 40 oz. to be exact. It saved so much time and as far as everyone thought they were fresh. I also left the pecans kinda big so those who didn't like nuts could pick them off.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I used canned sweet potatoes, mashed them, did the sauce on the stove-top, mixed together, then baked in a loaf pan-Yummy ! (Used heavy cream instead of the butter,milk mixture.)

I don't even like sweet potatoes and I loved this!  I made it for my MIL's birthday because she loves sweet potatoes.  I used walnuts because that's what I had on hand and it was delicious.  I did double the topping and leave out the flour as suggested by other reviews, I also added cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was perfect.  Very sweet and yummy!

I love candied yams and had never tasted sweet potato casserole. One day I tasted it in my cooking class and now I love it. It's more healthy than candied yams and to nuts on top are delicious. Now I make it for every holiday. It really is good, you should try it even if you don't like sweet potatoes.

These sweet potatoes were a huge hit.  Everyone wanted seconds.  I cheated a little and used canned sweet potatoes and just mashed them up and used the proper cup measurement.  These are so good they could be dessert.

Oh my, this was delicious!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, but other than that, I kept all the ingredients the same.  I made sure to chop the pecans very finely and the topping turned out perfectly!

Made this for Thanksgiving 3 years ago and it is now a staple at Thanksgiving Dinner. The first time I made it I used 2 29oz cans of cut sweet potatoes instead of fresh.  The following year I used fresh sweet potatoes.  NEVER EVER USE CANNED! It is 10 times better with fresh sweet potatoes. THe only variation I make is that I top it mini marshmallows the last 10 minutes of baking.  The pecan topping really makes this dish. So easy and so delicious

Excellent.  A local restaurant has what my family calls the best sweet potato casserole.  The first time I made this, they all agreed it was better than the restaurant’s.  I've made this several times.

I quit searching for a Thanksgiving star when I found this recipe.  My only changes are to substitute Grand Marnier for the milk and roast the sweet potatoes in the oven before mashing.

Good potluck food, received lots of compliments! My family doesn't care for nuts so I omitted them and it still had a nice, crunchy crust. It was hard to judge doneness as it was still somewhat soupy, it thickened in-transit.

This recipe is wonderful! It's the only way I can get my kids to eat sweet potatoes. As for the melted and solid butter, you can only "cut in" solid butter, so that should help.

My brother and I hate sweet potato casserole, but usually I go down to my Mother in Law's house for thanksgiving and Hubby gets Sweet Potato Casserole, so I had to make it this year.  I was only going to make a half batch, but I am so glad I didn't.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my brother (who gags at the thought of Sweet Potatos and has even thrown up after eating one) loved this dish.  My Sister in Law somehow convinced him to try them and he had *4* helpings!  There was barely enough for hubby and my Mom to have a second helping!  I tasted it myself and thought it was  pretty good for a sweet potato!  I made it again this past weekend and it turned out beautifully again!
Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dish again this Thanksgiving, and once again it was outstanding. Everyone was impressed and thought it was the best dish there. Even my sister, who is the pickiest eater every enjoyed it. I used mashed sweet potatoes that I made myself instead of from the can.

I'm going to rate this a 4, although I haven't tried it, I use have used one very similar for years and love it. The difference in the one I use is that the receipe calls for 3 cups of potatoes not 4 1/2 and for the topping I also add 1c coconut. No use in duplicating a good thing. I love the addition of the coconut and the 3 cups of potatoes is plenty.

Made this following the recipe exactly--and it was amazing!! We brought this dish to an "orphan Thanksgiving" pot luck with about 14 friends, and this was by far the most popular dish at the event. This tasted like pie! We will definitely make this one again.

This is one of the best side dishes for Thanksgiving  (or any time for that matter).  My kids ask for this at every Thanksgiving.  Really delicious and a twist on sweet potatoes other than a marshmallow topping.

FANTASTIC, I liked this just the way it was. My husband, however, opted to make a second casserole and added raisins to it. I don't like raisins but all those that tried both versions, loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving at my daughter's request. She loved it, of course. I thought it was a bit too sweet for a side dish - even though I could not stop eating it. It is like candy.

This was my first experience making or eating a sweet potato casserole and while it was really good, next time I will make some changes.  For my taste this recipe was both a touch too sweet and too soft.  So next time I will reduce the amount of sugar and milk.  Thanks for the recipe though, everyone enjoyed it.

i like sweet potatoes, so of course i enjoyed this casserole.  It is almost a dessert, but hey it's thanksgiving.  a healthier dessert, eaten with a huge meal! :D  anyway, this was great.  i left out the spices some used, it's almost dessert anyway. there was pumpkin pie to use the spice in.  we cut the sugar in half, used light brown sugar.  i also used evaporated milk and fresh farm eggs.  very great flavor.  my 19 year old son requested leftovers to take with him.  he really loved it!  a good sign for picky eaters!

This was so so good. I love sweet potatos no matter how they are done but this was the best I have ever had. I did mess up and ad the brown sugar to the mixture forgetting it was for the topping because I was so busy multi tasking but it didn't hurt it...I also used canned sweet potatos to cute down on time. Even some of my kids who don't like sweet potatos thought it was good! I know some people like cinnamon and all but this doesn't need it. It is perfect as is.

RAVE reviews when I made this for Easter. Next time I will omit the white sugar - made it too sweet. The brown sugar topping makes the dish sweet enough. I used real sweet potatoes and forgot to let them cool before mixing with the other ingredients. So, my eggs started to scramble a little bit! Oops. Rookie mistake.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon.

Loved this recipe.  Made it the night before and just had to bake right before my Mother's Day company came over.  Made this with the wake-up casserole which I also found on this website and ham.  Both the adults and the kid's loved this!

This is the easiest and tastiest sweet potato casserole! I made it for the first time for Christmas and it was a huge success!  My husband keeps asking me to make it again and again.  Even my dad, who is a chef, couldn't stop with the compliments.  Try it!!

This dish is really wonderful.  I used considerably less sugar (they are sweet potatoes after all) and only one egg to about 5 cups of sweet potatoes and then placed in a 9x9 glass baking dish.  The topping was more than ample for that size dish.  If you use a larger dish, you'll need more topping, but then the dish will really be more of a dessert, not a side dish.

This is my all-time favorite sweet potato recipe!  I was unable to locate the recipe that I had, but was lucky to find this one.  Followed the recipe as written, except maybe a tad more vanilla.  Too heavy to make regularly, but a great holiday dish!

I followed other's suggestions on this recipe.  I used evaporated milk instead of regular.  I also mashed the sweet potatoes the night before & added cinnamon & nutmeg to taste to the mashed sweet potatoes.  Then the next day I made the casserole.  It was awesome!  I've never liked Sweet Potato dishes at Thanksgiving but this was a hit!  I received alot of compliments!

After years of trying to make good sweet potato casseroles, I made this one for Thanksgiving.  Even members of our family who don't care for sweet potatoes tried it and liked it. We have several diabetics in the family, so I substituted the sugar/brown sugar with the Splenda variety and the dish was still absolutely wonderful. (Splenda brown sugar is really good even for non-diabetics). Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut the white sugar down to about 3/4 cup because other reviewers said it was too sweet. It was still sweet. I decided to try to fit the whole thing in a square pan (9x9) because I wanted to fit more in the oven on thanksgiving. Hmm this was a mistake because by the end of the cooking time it had run over and the brownsugar mixture was smoking on the bottom of the oven. Oh well, live and learn hehe. But I did cook my potatoes the night before and added the butter and milk and refrigerated so that in the morning I had less prep... this worked great! Overall very yummy and will try again!

Very Good recipe.  I used evaporated milk so it would taste richer.  I also cut sugar to 1/2 c.  Added 1 teasp of vanilla, 1teasp of cinnamon, 1/2 teasp salt, 1/2 teasp nutmeg.

I doubled the topping to 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of flour and 1 stick of butter.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  I modified the recipie a little bit - I baked 4 large sweet potatoes at 350, each  individually wrapped in aluminum foil, until they were very soft, at least an hour or so, and then peeled and mashed them; I used only 1/2 of sugar (not the 1 cup of white sugar called for),but split it up by using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar; I used half-n-half instead of milk, less butter than called for and used the "lite" variety, and added cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, both to the potato mixture, and to the pecan mixture.  Hardly anyone touched the regular mashed potatoes!  This dish is a keeper.

It was GREAT!!!!!My family loved it. I thought the recipe was perfect, not too sweet at all. I always do the traditional yams with marshmellows for Thanksgiving but this year I will be making this recipe for my family. My husband loved it and ate it for 4 days straight.

Absolutely wonderful.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but my husband is.  I was looking for a recipe that would tickle my fancy.  Well, this one did it!  It was great - I don't think I will make sweet potatoes any other way.  The topping is what does it for me - thanks for sharing :)

HO-LY CRAPPP!!  I nearly screamed with joy after taking a bite of this delightful dish. I had actually cut up a sweet potato to use in a different recipe and decided last second that I didn't need it. I was just going to use the extra potato to make sweet mashed potatoes, but stumbled across this highly-rated recipe, and decided it looked easy enough to make. I used a mixture of maple syrup and stevia instead of white sugar to reduce the glycemic index and almond milk instead of regular milk to make it vegan. Next time I'll probably use coconut milk and reduce the amount (since I'm using up part of the liquid consistency with maple syrup). I also used egg replacer (vegan). I doubled the brown sugar mixture, because I like a little extra crunch, and I didn't have any pecans. Anyway, it's delicious.

Huge Hit at Thanksgiving, even for those who don't normally eat sweet potatoes.  I used Yams instead, and topped with marshmellows instad of the pecan topping.

It was a great start for my own recipe! I did change it just a little. I did not use the white sugar at all, added 1/4 cup more of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon more of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. My mother could not eat pecan so I just added mine marshmellow instead. It reminded me of what I ate when I was a kid!! Thank you. Will have to make some with the pecan crunch next time for myself!!

It was ALL GONE before Dinner was over!  Made this as a passing dish for 12 people at Thanksgiving and it was gobbled up quick - several people had seconds and thirds!  I baked the sweet potatoes wrapped in foil (put on a cookie sheet to catch the drips) for 1.5 hours at 400 degrees first.  Then cooled and peeled easily.  I only used 1/4 c of sugar in the potato mixture - it was plenty sweet once the topping was added.  I used a hand mixer on the potato mixture and it came out light and creamy.  The rest of the recipe was followed exactly and it came out perfectly proportioned in a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Thanks for this great Holiday recipe!

Been using this recipe for about 5 years now. Family wouldn't let me leave it off the menu even if I wanted to! Only thing I add is about a half a shot of Bourbon. Try it, but not too much. Really just a splash.

HUGE hit!  Everyone loved it!  I would suggest using less sugar next time.  I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 3 hours.  Will be joining our Thanksgiving feast every year.

Stellar recipe!  I made this with 3 14 oz cans of sweet potatoes, and made the casserole one day in advance (put in refrigerator).  On Thanksgiving Day, merely popped it into the preheated oven.  Rave reviews!  The presentation, consistency, flavor and "crunch" of the topping were all excellent.  GREAT leftover also.  The topping maintained it's crunch even in the microwave.  Amazingly easy--thank you for a fantastic recipe.

A hit at Thanksgiving!  I did alter the recipe according to what the reviewer "Lisa" said to do.  I did feel that it was still a little too sweet but it was so great!  Thanks for this great recipe!  PS I hate sweet potato casserole with marshmallows, what a great alternative!

I was a little nervous about putting this dish on the table today...first time making from raw potatoes. Baked them last night (they seemed a little underdone) and prepped the filling part, using 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar. It almost tasted a little bland by itself. Set in fridge overnight, topped it today and baked for about 40 minutes. Hesitently took a bite at dinner...MMMMMMM! DELICIOUS! The topping was perfect and the whole dish wasn't over-the-top sweet! Don't know if I will use raw or canned potatoes next time, but I will use this recipe!!

Good recipe..I used Heavy whipping cream instead of milk (good for creamier texture).  I put cinnamon in the potaoes, and I used two cans of sweet pot.  So I reduced the sugar by 1/2 a cup so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Dont' forget to drain the canned potatoes if you use those! Added cinnamon to the topping as well.  Wonderful!!

I personally like the fact that spices are left out.  I want to taste the sweet potato.  Leave the spices for the pumpkin pie or add your own preference to the sweet potato casserole.

This was served at our early Thanksgiving dinner and it was AMAZING.  Got rave reviews from everyone.  The topping is a nice sweet crunch and better than more "traditional" marshmallows.  We'll be making this recipe for every Thanksgiving dinner in our future!

Most delicious sweet potato recipe I've ever tried. I did what some people suggested and cut the white sugar down to just 1/2 a cup. Made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit!

This is by far my favorite sweet potato recipe.  The first time I made it was for a luncheon at my husband's work.  He doesn't like sweet potatoes but tasted it since I had made it.  He liked it, had a serving of it and eats it at home when I make it.  I boiled and mashed my own potatoes and followed the recipe as written.  Thanks so much!

Was a little leary of not making the traditional sweet potatoes with marshmallows this year for Thanksgiving but wanted to try something a little different. This was PERFECT! I took the advice of others and substituted 1/3 cup half & half for the milk and 3/4 cup brown sugar for the white sugar. I also doubled the topping and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. It turned out light and fluffy and perfectly sweet. The whole family loved it and this recipe will become a new traditional holiday dish!!

EXCELLENT!!! I made this for our Thanksgiving lunch at work, and it was a hit!  After reading through the reviews, I adapted the recipe: definitely use BAKED sweet potato (I used 5 medium-large), substitute evaporated milk, use only 3/4 cup BROWN (not white) sugar, increase to 1 tsp vanilla, add 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I made the potato part the night before, added the topping in the morning and baked at 350 for 45 minutes in a 9x13 baking dish.  If you are wondering which sweet potato recipe to use this holiday, choose this one.  It will be devoured!!

this was good. I liked it very much, I just cut down the sugar a little bit because the brown sugar topping will balance it out nicely. A good side dish for sunday dinners or holiday dinners!

Excellent, Excellent and Excellent.  I did make a few changes:  1)  I used canned sweet pot. 2)  I only used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup butter 3)  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar 4)I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk 5) I skipped the topping completely  With all my changes I still received raving reviews.  Definitely a keeper...:)

You don't have to like sweet potatoes to LOVE this dish!  I found this recipe 3 years ago and have been making it for the holidays and for work potlucks.  I have had countless people rave over this and ask me for the recipe.

Great casserole! I prefer a marshmallow topping. I take it out 5 minutes early, throw on some marshmallows, and let it finish cooking.

I served this dish when my in-laws were here.  My father-in-law loves sweet potatoes.  Well, he liked it but I felt like brown sugar and pecans were a little too much.

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make, and always turns out perfect. I do make one change in the recipe. I am not a fan of chopped pecans in my sweet potato casserole so I discard them. Instead I top the casserole in the last ten minutes in the oven with an even layer of marshmallows. I continue cooking until they are perfectly browned, which usually takes about 10 minutes, maybe less. This is the perfect topping. With this small change this recipe makes a perfectly sweet and smooth casserole.

This was really good. I am giving it 4 stars, and not 5 since I had to cut the sugar in the potato mixture to 1/3 cup. That was plenty sweet! Keep the topping just like it is though- perfect. I did, however, miss the marshmallows on top this year- so I'll have to bring those back next year. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the 3rd year in a row that I have made this tasty dish!  Being that 3rd times a charm, I finally found what makes this recipe such a hit.  First, it is MUCH better taste wise and consistancy wise to bake your potatoes wrapped in foil for 1-2 hours, depending on size.  I also found that it needs more potatoes if you don't want a runny casserole.  And finally, at least double the crumb topping.  I also used both Slenda Brown and White sugar and wheat flour!!!  I personally thought it tasted even better.  I couldn't get enough reviews.  Even my 1 yr. old nephew was gobbling this down.

Hmm, I love sweet potatoes, but I wasn't a huge fan of this one.  I thought it was much too sweet, even though I used the lighter, yellow sweet potatoes instead of the usual "yam" style sweet potatoes (which are sweeter).  I added a little cinnamon and cloves, and even so, it tasted pretty bland, and just too sweet.  This has enough to it, nutritionally, to make it a main dish (as I intended it to be), but I would only ever have it for dessert.

This recipe has become a family tradition -- they practically beg me to make it for every  family get-together we have! One way to make it easier is to use canned sweet potatos. No one can tell the difference and it saves a lot of time peeling and cooking the yams.

This was awesome!  I made this for Thanksgiving and because there were a lot of people watching their sugar I used a Splenda mix for the potatoes and a brown sugar Splenda mix for the topping.  I also added cinnamon to the topping.  Simply mahvelous!!

this was awesome! this was my first attempt at a thanksgiving dinner, and this really gave my dinner an extra kick. i'm a terrible procrastinator though and since i didnt remember to pick up pecans, i used almonds in the topping instead. it still turned out delicious and satiated my sweet tooth quite well.

I've been making this recipe for several years...taking it to office Thanksgiving lunches as well as making it at home...and it always turns out perfect. (I've even substituted canned sweet potatoes and it's still perfect.)  In my opinion, this could double as a desert.

If you alter this recipe, it's VERY good.  The nuts really add to this dish.  I made it with half the white sugar, 2 tablespoons of butter witht the potatoes, 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for the topping.  I kept everything else the same.

I can't fathom making it with any more sugar or butter.  Even this much made my stomach ache after I ate a bowl, and I'm the kind of person who can eat a pint of haagen daazs at a time without a problem.

I got rave reviews when making this dish for picky family members at Thanksgiving.  I did make some substitutions, though:  I used heavy cream in place of the milk, and I added a teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also, I highly recommend that you use fresh sweet potatoes (I used 5 large) rather than using the canned shortcut.  It's definitely worth the extra time.   Yummy!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I think it would have been excellent if I would have followed the directions.  I used canned yams instead of cooked sweet potatoes.  I thought this would save on time, but I think the extra time would have been worth it.  My husband thought the topping was too sweet.  I will make it again but make a few adjustments.

Delicious!!  I love sweet potatoes anyway, but this one is outstanding.  Not overly sweet or heavy, yet the pecan streusel topping is almost like a praline topping. Perfect!  I will definitely keep this one handy.

Beware of making this dish in too deep of a pan.  The first time I made it, I doubled it and the middle didn't set up.  Needs a shallow baking dish for success.

way to much sugar. Instead of adding the cup of white sugar to the potato mix just use the brown sugar and flour for the topping

This recipe is great, have been using a variation of it in my family for years.  Use a hand mixer to mash the sweet potatoes and the "strings" in the potatoes will wrap around the mixer, removing them easily for a better texture.

Oh my gosh! This stuff is delicious! I live in Quebec, Canada and I had honestly never had a sweet potato casserole before.  I was looking for a side dish to bring to our family Thanksgiving potluck, and I thought I would give this a try. Everyone loved it! I am now requested to make it at Christmas too! I used about half the sugar it called for, and it was still plenty sweet.

This is a four star recipe. With the changes I made based off other people's reviews, it's definitely a five star. The dish was scraped clean. I used 6 baked sweet potatoes (wrap in foil, 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until they are soft). For the filling I also subbed 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the cup of white sugar, subbed evaporated milk in for regular milk, and doubled the amount of vanilla. For the crust I added more pecans but other than that kept it the same. However, when I put it in the oven for the 25 minutes, the top wasn't crunchy... the flour and sugar mixed together were just sitting on top. So I melted some more butter, poured it on top and baked it until I was happy with the topping. A lot longer... at least 50 minutes of total baking time. And it was great!

Very delicious and easy to bake!  Instead of boiling, I cooked my sweet potatoes in the oven without foil directly on the rack for about 25 minutes.  Make sure to poke them with a fork.  You can also microwave 1 potato at a time for about 7 minutes and then once they were cooked, I slide a fork prong under the skin long ways and cut it all the way down lengthwise and then pulled it off quite easily.

I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it for a large Thanksgiving feast. I microwaved the sweet potatoes because that's just who I am as a cook... don't judge. It was very easy, even for a less experienced cook like me. It really was delicious and there were no left overs. It was such a hit I was just asked to make again this year. Sadly, my green beans were not as well received.

Very tasty. While others at the table would have given it five stars, I thought it was too sweet and would try and cut down on the sugar next time.

YUM!!  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes in general.  My husband actually found this recipe and made it as part of our anniversary dinner.  We made it as stated, except we cut back on the sugar a bit.  This is absolutely delicious!!  I have even been snacking on leftovers cold out of the fridge!  We'll definitely keep this one around.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

WOW. I used about 12 potatoes (baked, not canned), added about 2/3 c bourbon, replaced most of the white sugar with light & dark brown, and cut out most of the butter in the sweet potato part.  This thing is DIVINE. Downright sinful. Be sure to send any leftovers home with your guests, otherwise it'll be calling your name from the fridge..

This is DELICIOUS!!  Due to previous reviews, I only put 1/4 cup of sugar and next time will omit it all together.  Rave reviews at the Thanksgiving table.  This is the new staple for us at the  holidays.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  I made it last year and everyone loved it.  I added marshmallows to the top b/c my husband grew up with that but personally I don't like them.  This year I made it with only 1/4 cup sugar added to the sweet potatoes.  They are so delicious on their own that you could omit it all together and it will still be sweeter than your pumpkin pie!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent. Based on some other reviews, I used evaporated milk and halved the white sugar because I didn't want both parts of the casserole to be very sweet, just the topping. I made this to bring to Thanksgiving dinner because I know no one in my family really likes sweet potatoes, so if I messed up, no one would really care. But it was the highlight of the dinner. Everybody raved about it. I baked 6 yams and cooked it for maybe 35 minutes. It was really delicious. I'm a terrible cook and still managed to pull it off. Try it. Seriously.

Used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the pecan topping. (We also added marshmallows to the top at the end because it's tradition) My brother said this was the best sweet potato casserole he's ever had.

I've been making something similar for years. I omit the white sugar all together, since I find the dish sweet enough without it. I add a pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger to the mix as well. I mix together a little maple syrup and orange juice to pour over the top, rather than the sugar crumble.  Rave reviews.

I made this for a Veterans luncheon and it was really good. I acidentially put the cup of brown sugar into the potatoes (whoops) but it didn't affect them at all. It needed to bake for 40 minutes to get brown in my oven, but a good dish. Thanks for sharing... "G"

Fantastic! My in-laws raved about it. They confessed that they didn't like sweet potatoes much, but they came back for seconds of this casserole. I baked 4 sweet potatoes, reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup, and used evaporated milk. Next time, I think I will reduce the white sugar even further.

Since I was a child, I have put down that I hate two things:  Sweet Potatoes, and Liver.  I no longer hate sweet potatoes because of this recipe!  In fact, I think I can say I LOVE them!  Fabulous recipe!!!

Good recipe, I ended up with a very thick layer of streusel - but my husband said to not change a thing, so this recipe is now in my box. I served it at Thanksgiving this year, and it went over very well.

Yum!  I made this for Thanksgiving, very good!  I did cut back the sugar by about 1/3 cup, the first time I made this I thought it was way too sweet, but I don't like overly sweet, so you should be fine to follow the recipe exact.

I have just downed the last portion of this delicious casserole - COLD!  It was even delicious that way.  This would also make a lovely winter dessert.  I just love it.  Thanks for the post!

I have been making this for years and it is soooo good.   I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh just to save time.   At Thanksgiving I usually make the sweet potato filling the night before and the next day just top with the pecan mixture and bake.  So easy and yummy.

I made this for the first time yesterday (thanksgiving) and it was a HUGE hit, everyone, including people who did not like sweet potatoes, LOVED it. I baked the potatoes for an hour and a half before hand, wich made a huge difference to me, the skin just peeled right off, and i added a dash of cinnimon and nutmeg as others suggested. I would recommend this dish and i will be making it again!

So yummy. I was able to make it healthier. I used cubed(not canned)yams. I cooked dotted with butter and covered in the oven at 350 for about 50 minutes. Then made the struesel exactly as written and then put in the oven for 25 minutes as the instructions said.

This is really good!  But a whole cup of white sugar is a really unwise choice for so many of us.  I used 3/4 cup pure maple syrup instead and it came out wonderful!

Yummy!   I made this for my family using 6 large baked sweet potatoes and yams (3 each), so I probably had more then the four cups the recipe called for. I added one additional egg, but kept everything else the same. It came out perfect, and not too sweet at all. My family loved it and there were no left-overs!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I have a made a version of it for Thanksgiving for the last few years.  The only difference is using half & half instead of milk.  It has a souffle-like consistency.  I don't even like sweet potatoes, and I eat this for days after the holidays!  It is wonderful!

Okay, so I am a little late on the rating of this, seeing as I made it on Thanksgiving, but it's better late than never, right?   In one word, this was: delicious!   I will be making this again, and perhaps halving the recipe, as this makes a TON of deliciousness!

I would say the secret to this recipe lies in the topping. Never use melted butter(only softened) so it can be cut into the mixture, So that it can be sprinkled. Otherwise it will turn out wet and doesn't spread well. I always start out with less butter than called for, you can alwasy add to. I have been making this recipe for holiday dinners for a couple years now.- just now taking the time to rate it. It realy is the best "as is" No changes needed. Thank You!!

I made this for Easter.  Like a previous reader, our family has a traditional casserole that we do for holidays, but I decided to bring something different and found this recipe!  I've never seen a bigger hit-recipe before!  My family LOVED it, and asked for it again!!!  I followed another reader's advice too, and substituted evaporated milk instead of regular milk, used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, upped the vanilla to 1-tsp, and added nutmeg and cinnamon.  BRAVO!

Delicious!  I followed other reviewers and used 6 sweet potatoes.  Peeled, quartered, boiled, then mashed and added other ingredients.  This DEFINITELY does not need as much sugar as the recipe called for.  It was borderline too sweet so next time I will probably use half the amount called for.  I took this to our Easter dinner yesterday and it got rave reviews!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, but decided before making it to cut down on the richness.  I cut down the white sugar to 1/2 cup, the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, the flour to 1/3 cup and the butter to 1/4 cup.  It turned out plenty sweet and rich.  My grandchildren loved it and cleaned the dish.

This is decadent. I love sweet potatoes, but I wanted something without the marshmallow topping. This recipe was every bit the treat that you would expect it to be for a holiday dinner. Sooooo yummy!  (But it's not one I would use on a regular basis- it's a treat)

This is a winner!  A few changes due to my own "issues" with eggs.  I couldn't make myself put eggs into the mix, I just don't know why it needed eggs.  Also, I used honey to sweeten rather than the sugar in the potato mix because I wanted to really make the topping stand out!  It had rave reviews and none was left at Christmas!!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  My kids, who hate sweet potatoes, totally devoured it and asked when I was going to make it again.  For those of you who are skeptics, definitely try it.  I used the canned yams and it make for a fast side dish.  I had it prepped and ready to go in the oven after the turkey was done.  I agree with the reviewer to double the topping.  It was definitely a must have!

Best recipe ever. Everybody at the table thought that was the best dish. I have been making it for 2 Thanksgivings already. I did not change the recipe at all, I added Marshall Mellow on part of the dish and this dish is better without it for sure. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is the BEST way to make sweet potatoes!!  Goodbye marshmallows, HELLO pecans!!  I've been making this recipe for a few years, but at Thanksgiving yesterday everyone went back for second and third helping of this.  I normally follow the recipe exactly, but yesterday, for my dad who follows a special diet, I tweaked it so he could eat it.  I put NO butter in with the sweet potatoes, used egg beaters, skim milk, and I used smart balance butter with the pecan mixture, and I have to say that it still tasted great!!!

There are quite a few recipes for Sweet Potato Casseroles and they all differe, slightly.  Ruth's Chris restaurant has a video on You Tube and it uses a similar recipe.  They're based in New Orleans and they use 3 cups mashed potatoes, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 eggs, slightly beaten, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup).  For the topping they use 1 cup light brown sugar, 1/3 cup self rising flour (you can make your own), 1 cup chopped pecans and 1/3 stick butter.  I also added a half teaspoon of nutmeg or cinnamon, if you prefer cinnamon.  You don't need the milk or cream.  I have dined at Ruth's Chris in Chicago and their sweet potato casserole is to-die-for.  Try this variation and I am sure you'll love it!

This was delicious.  I made it yesterday, but unfortunately did not have any pecans, so I had to modify it with what I had on hand.  It still came out great.  I plan on making this again for Thanksgiving and making sure to use the pecans.  I bet it will be even better.

Really delicious.  Per other suggestions, I halved the amount of white sugar, added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon, and used whole pecans.  It was a big hit!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a big hit. I made it the night before.  The next day, I covered it with aluminum foil and reheated it in the oven.  I accidentally left it in the oven way too long, but it was delicious anyway.  My family has always made candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows, so I was a little nervous about trying something new.  My father, brother, and daughter are the three sweet potato lovers in my family, and they all gave it two thumbs up.  I'll definitely make this again next year.

As other reviewers I used 1/2 C sugar and added some cinnamon. I tend to usually not like sweet potato casseroles because they're way too sweet, but this with reduction of the sugar was very good and my guest all said they liked the less sweet version. The topping was very good.

This recipe went over very well with my family for Thanksgiving. I only made a few modifications out of personal preference: I used 1/2 cup white sugar instead of one whole cup since it also has brown sugar and added 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg & 3T. of orange juice.

Really liked this and it will my staple sweet potatoes for thanksgiving from now on as it wasn't nauseatingly sweet.  The only thing I did was use 1 and 1/2 time the topping.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an excellent recipe.  I served it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  
I reduced the white sugar by 1/2 and used Splenda.  I also reduced the light brown sugar by 1/2. It was yummy.  
Be sure to watch carefully, because the pecans can burn easily.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Since we prefer to top it with marshmallows, I will definitely reduce the white sugar to 1/2 C next time.  I think the marshmallows took the sweetness over the top for us.  But, oh so good!!

Our family's favorite! I would be in big trouble if I didn't make this for our Thanksgiving meal! It is really fabulous. The only thing I do differently is that I add cream to the potatoes instead of milk. Only for special occasions. ;)

I have used this recipe every Easter and Thanksgiving for the past couple years, and it is the best!!!  I like to up the vanilla to 1 tsp and substitute light cream for the milk (makes it richer).  I will be making this for Easter again this year!  My whole family requests it!!

This is the BEST sweet potato recipe I have ever had.  I make it every year for Thanksgiving.  The topping is what makes it so good.  I love that the potatoes aren't overly sweet, just enough to make them delicious.  The chopped pecans are a must.

I am not a huge fan of sweet potato casserole but after this I will be making it EVERY year for Thanksgiving.  I did lower the sugar a tiny bit and used half white, half brown in the potatoes. This was gone in a flash, delicious!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I used a 9x13 pan to bake in and next time I will double the recipe for the topping because there wasn't quite enough to cover the entire surface of the casserole.

I brought this to a family Christmas party this past Sunday and it was a huge hit.  Already got requests to make for Christmas Eve.  The topping is great.  I used a bit less sugar and whipped the sweet potatoes with an electric mixer-they came out very light and fluffy.

Great recipe! Even my husband who usually will not touch the sweet potatoes on Thanksgiving, gobbled this up. I baked my sweet potatoes and cut back on the sugar. Very sweet, even then! I loved it, and the topping is nice and caramelly crisp.

FANTASTIC.  My family (most of whom usually turn up their noses at sweet potatoes) actually loved them.  i probably made more topping than called for (wasn't really measuring) but the entire thing was tasty!  Thank you!

This dish was a huge success at Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I should've made copies of the recipe and took it with me.  Thanks.

Delicious and will now become a stable of our Thanksgiving feast!

Can't state how impressive and delicious it tastes.  People were fighting over the leftovers!

Oh my gosh! I am from the West Coast, but have been living in the South since 1992. The first time I tasted a sweet potato casserole, I loved it. It was so different that the hum drum sweet potatos I grew up on...chunks of sp with brown sugar. Well, friends came in from Utah and never tasted anything like it. The combination of the pecan/brown sugar topping over smooth sweet potatos...it was a hit! I will never go back to chunks of sp served a la boring. Even the kids loved it and this recipe is a great "ploy" to get the kiddies to partake of their veggies! Truly a keeper! You will not be dissapointed!

Spectacular.  This was such a great side dish.  Everyone loved the topping.  It just added something extra special.  It was a nice contrast of textures to the creamy potato.

This is truly fantastic, I didn't change a thing!  Don't save it just for the holidays, I'd eat this anytime.  It went especially well with pork chops, since the sweet balanced the salty.

Awesome!  My husband pointed out that this really tastes like pecan pie; he's right!  So, if you like pecan pie, you'll love this casserole.  This was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner.

I got rave reviews for this recipe!  I had to use more sweet potatoes, about an extra 2 cups, to fill up the dish I was using.  I kept the rest of the ingredients the same and it was still perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe

You will convert even the most vocal sweet potato-haters with this recipe! I never cared much for sweet potatoes or yams before making this casserole. I stab sweet potatoes with a fork and microwave til soft(they will ooze, so microwave on a plate). I add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. cloves to potato mixture. I sometimes substitute yams for sweet potatoes. This could also be a dessert. I want to lick the bowl kind of yumminess!

I have been serving this casserole for several years. It turns all my non sweet potato eaters into lovers!!  I too have added cinnimon and nutmeg to the recipe and it only adds to the flavor. My entire family insists this be served at all holiday dinners and beg for it all year long, it is so simple I don't mind preparing it upon request!!

This was a delicious way to make sweet potatoes. I would definitely recommend cutting back on the sugar unless you like it really sweet. I did half the white sugar, and half the topping and it was still sweet. I will definitely make it again, probably with even less sugar. Very tasty, kids love it!

I decreased the sugar in this recipe (in both the topping & the potato mixture) to a very scant 2/3 cup. This kept it from being so sweet that it tasted like a dessert instead of a side dish. Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving, there was barely any left! Thanks :)

This Thanksgiving was my first time making sweet potatoes of any kind and to be honest I was not crazy about sweet potatoes in the past.  This recipe made me a sweet potato lover.  This recipe is AWESOME!  My whole family raved over it!  It was the most popular dish at our Thanksgiving table.  I have already passed the dish onto 2 friends.  Make this dish it is a keeper!

Family raved. For optimal sweet potato flavor, I cut them in half lengthwise, brushed the inside with olive oil and sprinkled with nutmeg allspice and cinnamon, then baked them face down on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Able to peel the skin right off with you hand by that point, and the sweet potato’s are juicy and flavorful. Be sure to mix well with and electric mixer

This was an easy recipe to make. I baked the sweet potatoes the night before and assembled it on Thanksgiving day. The only change I would make would be to decrease the amount of sugar in the base as well as the crumble by half. Maybe the potatoes were sweeter on their own.  The sweetness made it more of a dessert which was fine.  It was also pretty tasty the days after as left overs. Definitely would make it again.

This was a great hit! I did use a little less sugar in the sweet potatoes and I substituted chopped walnuts. Forgot to add the vanilla but didn't change the great reviews from the willing consumers at the table. Will definitely make again.

This was good, but I decided while making it that a cup of white sugar had to be too much. I was definitely right. Next time, I will probably only use half a cup. It would probably be better with slightly less butter as well.

#Costco size recipe.

6 lb can yams
4.5 cups pecans
1.5 cups white sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp nutmeg
double all other ingredients
baked 45 mins at 350 in large disposable aluminum pan
also sprinkled more cinnamon before topping

pros: good crunch to the topping, great taste when you get a full bite of topping and potatoes, good ratio of topping.

cons:. 1.5 cups of white sugar is 'almost' the right sweetness. I want to try 1 2/3 cup, probably about right.  Topping mixture was very hard to whisk / combine with the butter, but could be because my butter wasn't completely soft, and my brown sugar was clumpy. Just a little aggravating.

Not a bad adaptation of the recipe. Happy with the results.

I really liked this recipe!! It was my first time EVER making sweet potato anything, so I definitely rate this as a success.  The only thing I did was add a little cinnamon (personal preference - they were fine as is). Thank you! I now have another solid recipe in my arsenal!

I have made this several times. I don't change a thing except instead of the pecan topping sometimes I will just add marshmallows on top and broil for a few seconds. Both are amazing!!

This was a real hit with my family.  My oldest daughter (who hates sweet potatoes) LOVED this dish.  She ate over half of the leftovers!  Of course,  there weren't many leftovers.

I would lessen the amount of sugar when I make this again, which I definitely will!!

This was really delicious and a hit with the family.  I would cut back on the white sugar next time though as it could be less sweet and still excellent.  I like the suggestion of BARBARALB to try sweetened condensed milk, cinammon and nutmeg...will likely do that next time in lieu of the milk and will adjust the sugar.  I forgot to put the eggs in so the texture was likely different than intended but not an issue.  It's on my Christmas dinner menu!

Update:  I made this for Christmas dinner and cut the white sugar in half which suited our taste better.  Everyone loved it!

My sister made this on Thanksgiving.  It was the best sweet potato casserole I have ever eaten.  Better than the one I make too, and mine was great.  So then I made it myself for Christmas Eve.  It was easy to make.  I even used gluten fee flour.  Couldn't tell the difference.  It tasted so delicious.  I have officially replaced the SP casserole that I used to make with this one.  I will make it again and again.

Yummy!  I tried this recipe for thanksgiving dinner, my mother in-law freaked out at first because it wasn't traditional  sweet potatoes.  This last year it was requested because it was such a hit!! I made some changes: I used Agave instead of white sugar and used soy milk.  No one even noticed.  I did keep the topping just like the recipe.

This is WAY too sweet.  Two cups of sugar?!
I took some of the other cooks' advice and used less sugar than called for but this still tasted like dessert.  I did like the underlying tastes. will maybe give it another try in the future with half to 3/4 less sugar.  Just need to figure out how to make the topping without a cup of sugar.

Amazing recipe! I stuck to the recipe as followed, but broiled the top for five mins before taking it out of the oven. That gave it some extra crunch which my whole family loved. Will make this again.

I have been making this and only this one since I found this recipe.  I have done the recipe to a T and done some revamping..  The difference, it only gets better every year.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe!  Oh an FYI, my husband hates nuts, but this casserole is the exception!

This was a great quick fix. The only thing i did different was reduce the ketchup to 2 tablespoons as other reviewers had recomended. but i am not a big fan of ketchup anyway. But as for the ketchup flavor it is different strokes for different folks. I would try adding a little at a time and taste to suit you. I used jumbo biscuits because that is all i had. Next time i will use regular size as i found that i was getting more biscuit than the filling and it was drowning the flavor out. To make the cream cheese mix smooth microwave for 30 seconds, stir, add the milk and microwave for 30 more seconds and mix until smooth then add to other ingredients.

Far too sweet of a topping. I love the idea of the pecans... if there is a way to take out the brown sugar and still have a crispy top, then this would be great. Otherwise its just a dessert.

This has been my go to recipe since finding it on All Recipes!  The only changes I made was use 3/4 cup sugar, and evaporated milk in place of regular milk!  My family raves over this, and look forward to me making it!

Tasty and easy. Used canned yams and evaporated milk and no sugar IN the potatoes. May add suggested spices next time. Will use three large cans of yams but the same amount of topping as I thought it was too much.

Followed the 1/2 sugar (white and brown) advice and the reduced (by 1/3) butter advice. A wonderful change and I believe healthier way to make than the marshmallow version. An instant family classic.

Changed just a few things - I used two 29 oz. cans of yams instead of spending the time making my own. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup white sugar and I used pecan chips instead of the chopped. This was wonderful!!! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was very good!  I did make changes to what others suggested and I did add cinnamon.  What is sweet potato casserole without cinnamon?!?  I got a lot of compliments and even from those who don't normally like sweet potatoes.

Fabulous! Had two new recipes for sweet potatoes and so did both by cutting this and the other recipe in half. Should have done all of it this one. Followed the recipe exactly. The sweet potato came out custard like because of the egg and milk. Delish!

We never have sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving, no idea why though. I made this with our thanksgiving feast. It was fabulous! The only thing I changed was instead of all white sugar in the mixture I used half brown sugar. Absolutely scrumptious!

Perfect.   I roasted five sweet potatoes and that made it really easy to pop right out of their skin.  I made this for Thanksgiving and refrigerated for a day or so until I was ready to bake it.  I did use brown sugar instead of white but it turned out delicious!

Great recipe, but waaaaay too sweet for my family's taste buds. I made it with a third a cup of brown sugar in the topping and nothing but the eggs, vanilla, and some Smart Balance in the potato. It was plenty sweet -- and the family LOVED it! :)

Perfection.  I have made this by following the recipe exactly and it was great.  I have also "modified" it by using canned sweet potatoes (ran out of time) and it was equally good.

These were soooo good. I halved this recipe and followed it exactly except that I reduced slightly the amount of white sugar, increased the amount of vanilla slightly, and added 1/s tsp of cinnamon, a 1/4 t. of nutmeg and salt each.

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and the only changes that I make are that I 1/2 the sugar and double the vanilla.  The topping is wonderful and it's tempting to double it but you really don't need to.  It does seem to take longer to bake though; I bake mine for about an hour; which seems like the perfect time to me.  Great recipe; thank you!

Great recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and made everyone try it, even those that said they did not like sweet potatoes and everyone loved it! I followed the advice of others and cut back on the white sugar (1/2 c). It definitely taste more like a dessert than a side dish. :O)

I followed the directions exactly and it didn't taste right. Not sure where I went wrong. I might try again and use some of the other suggestions.

I have made this for the last few years for the holidays and it is always a hit. I do substitue as others have said. I use evaporated milk - I started out using regular milk but the texture with the evaporated is better. I also cut down on the sugar to 1/2 cup and add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. Great recipe

not being a sweet potato fan myself, i am going off of the oohs and aahhs i received at the dinner table. as per my father in law, this was by far the best SP casserole he'd ever had. everyone loved the topping, and i had no leftovers.

A great recipe indeed. I added a few additional ingredients to give this a nice kick: 4 tbsp of disaronno amaretto, dash of cinnamon, and 1 tspn of vanilla butter nut extract. I also substituted the milk with half and half.

The search is over, people! This is an amazing recipe. I've made several different versions of a sweet potato casserole over the years but now I have THE recipe. I did half the amount of white sugar in the base but it was still wonderful. My husband always eats a little bit of the sweet potatoes but for the first time ever, he went for seconds. The casserole is fluffy and light and the topping is the perfect complement; some are just TOO sweet. I am calling this the Goldilocks of Sweet Potato Casseroles because it is "just right." Also, I prepared it the night before but took it out of the frig about 30 minutes before I was ready to pop it in the oven. All I had to do was prepare the topping and in to the oven it went. YUMMY!

I need to put another rave review!
I make this every year and always get asked for the recipe. I do cut back on the sugar b/c it is really sweet and I add marshmallows on top.

This turned out pretty good.  I did reduce the sugar a bit, and will probably reduce the amount of butter on the topping next time.  I would make ths again.

This was so good! I used canned sweet potatoes and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture and topping. I also like others was afraid it might be too sweet so I used less sugar and brown sugar. My son's loved this.. and how many young men will even try a sweet potato dish. This was very good and my son said I need to make this more often, not just Thanksgiving.

My family is not a sweet potato family... we just never like them or eat them, yet my aunt makes them every year.  I guess more for tradition.  This year I knew she wasn't coming over, so I figured I'd try my hand at it this year with this recipe.

What a great idea!  These were delicious!!!!  My family couldn't get enough of them and they were sooo good!  I did do a few adjustments, but not much... I used about 5 cups of mashed sweet potatoes, used the light butter and splenda, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and that's about all I changed.  Thanks for making my family love sweet potato casserole!

This was delicious! I lost my old recipe so decided to give this a try. The topping is a great treat. My husband was disappointed at first when I was making sweet potatos without marshmallows on top. He loved this! Definitely will be saving this one!

OH BOY! Well I had to adjust this recipe to  
22 servings. Its amazing, everyone loved it. I cannot tell you how many family members at our thankgiving dinner event wanted this recipe. this recipe will now be a part of our family dinner from now on. Thank You for this wonderful recipe. Oh by the way I baked the sweet potatos at 375 degrees for 1 hour. I used 7 sweet potatos for this. bake em and pull of the skins shortly after removing from oven. Then mash em and follow the recipe from there. Trust me you will love this. Again thank You mary48  :)

Absolutely delicious!  Whatever you do do not use canned sweet potatoes. What a difference using fresh sweet potatoes make!  I baked mine in the oven at 375 for one hour and the peelings just came right off.  I've never used them before but decided it give it a try when I saw this recipe and I'm so glad I did, major difference in the taste.  The recipe was just right and not too sweet for our taste.  The topping was wonderful. You could decorate the outer edge with marshmallows if you are torn about the topping but really they are not needed  I did use heavy cream in place of milk just because I wanted it very rich, it's not necessary though.  This will be our holiday sweet potato casserole from now on for sure!

OMG!! My kids who are the picky-est of eaters LOVE this!! They prefer just marshmallows for the topping but I like the suggested topping. My parents who own a restaurant couldn't get enough of this. My dad suggested you could get away with this as the filling for sweet potato pie!!! YUM

the most perfect sweet potato casserole ever.  i added about a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne for some spice and it literally sent it over the edge of deliciousness. but the recipe is amazing as is.

I tend to alter most recipes but this one is great without any alterations! I did leave it in the oven an extra 10 minutes to brown the topping. I took it to a church dinner & was asked repeatedly for the recipe.

Ever since I started making this recipe, it's been requested at every holiday gathering I attend.  I followed the recipe as is.  I debated using the nuts, but I'm glad I did.  For someone who isn't a big nut fan, they sure do make this recipe even better!!

Excellent and easy...I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping and used walnuts that I had on hand.  It took a bit longer than 25 minutes but was well worth it.

This is a great recipe with a few changes. I only used 1/3 cup sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes & it was as sweet as pie. I used soy milk and seasoned the potato mixture with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I roasted 6 orange "yam"-type sweet potatoes and had a litte extra potato left over. I will make this again, but will make it lighter by reducing the amount of butter. It was great - like a cross between pumpkin and pecan pie.

This has now been my sweet potato casserole for 2 years now....HOWEVER.... It is WAY TOO SWEET. I suggest mashing the potatoes then adding the white sugar 1 Tablespoon at a time to the desired sweetness. I use about 3 Table spoons of white sugar, that's it. Any sweeter and it belongs in a pie crust and not in a casserole dish. I also cut the brown sugar in the topping in half.

Everyone raved over this at Thanksgiving dinner.  My grandmother is diabetic, and many of us are trying to watch what we eat, so I subbed margarine for butter, egg beaters for eggs, splenda for sugar, and the Splenda brown sugar blend for the regular brown sugar.  It still turned out great.

This recipie worked with great success o nthe maiden voyage. I precooked the dish the nigth before with exception of the marshmellows. When I was rady the next day I added the marshmellows and baked for 40 mins. Note: I used 1.25 cups of brown sugar in lieu of the specified amount. Sweet results.

Sooooooo good. My first attempt at sweet potato casserole, and everyone at THanksgiving loved it.  I made it for two small get-togethers, so I just halved the recipe (but kept the topping recipe the same). I followed some suggestions given by other reviewers, and just used a 29 oz can of sweet potatoes for each half-batch, doubled vanilla, added cinnamon, and substitued evaporated milk for the reg milk.  I also cooked it for about 10 minutes longer to get the topping in the middle of the dish a little bubbly.  I will absolutely make this again and again.

I made this receipe at Christmas and got rave reviews.  My husband and I don't care for sweet potatoes, but actually LOVED the taste of this receipe.  Anyone that doesn't normally like the taste I would encourage to give this receipe a try.  The nutmeg, vanilla and brown sugar give such a delicious flavor and the pecans make it unique and excellent!

Delicious! Everyone at Christmas dinner wanted to know where I'd found this recipe. I did cut back on the sugar (used 1/2 as much as the recipe called for) and it was plenty sweet!

The best ever!!!  I made this for the holidays and it was soooo delicious.  It was the hit of the dinner.  Thank you for a new twist on an old favorite.  (Although, some youngsters complained of no marshmallows, but surprise surprise, they had seconds anyway.)

Great recipe if you like sweet potatoes. I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe exactly and my parents RAVED about it! My kids and hubby weren't impressed, but they don't like sweet potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!  I will make these again and so will mom.

I LOVED this recipe. I will be making it for Christmas day. The first and only time I made it, I thought that I might like it a bit more "solid" so I will have to take a look at maybe lessening an ingredient next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit!  The recipe makes a lot so next time I will cut it in half.  I usually hate the stringiness of sweet potatoes, but in this recipe since the potatoes are mashed, there are no strings!  Will definitely make this again!

I made this last year for Christmas and my Grandpa, who is 94 years old, said it was the best he had ever tasted. He took home all the leftovers. The topping is really sweet and crispy and the whole family loved it.

This was amazing!  I didn't change a thing.  I was a little nervous making this on Thanksgiving Day for the first time.  But, I trusted the reviews and just went for it.  It was a huge hit, everyone loved it (even those who said they didn't like sweet potatos). Everyone wanted the recipe!

Will be making this again for Christmas.  Will try to remember to take a photo too. The one listed isn't very appealing.  Mine was very pretty.    I made this for Thanksgiving.  Used pecan halves for the topping.  So yummy.  Used 2 giant cans of sweet potatoes to save me the time. Also only a half cup of the white sugar instead of an entire cup but then used a half cup of brown sugar in the mixture. Very good. A keeper for sure.

I love sweet potatoes and loved the concepts for this casserole, but I wanted to make it a little healthier.  I often like to mix butternut squash with sweet potatoes because I think they go well together.  So I used 1 butternut squash and 2 medium sized sweet potatoes, baked in the oven until soft.  I also eliminated the butter altogether, used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white, and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix.  The mixture was a little runny, so I added a Tbsp or so of flour.  I just sprinkled chopped walnuts on top instead of the streusel topping.  Altogether, I think this made the recipe healthier, and I personally didn't miss the butter at all.  One friend thought it was good but needed some more sweetness, but I thought it was sweet enough, and with the extra spices, it actually tasted a lot like sweet potato pie filling!  Yum!

Way too sweet.  I even used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of a cup and it was still sweet.  I will definitely cut out the white sugar all together and let the natural sugars from the potato stand alone.  As far as the pecan topping it was delicious but again too much brown sugar there too.  I will cut that amount as well.  Otherwise this would be a hit.

I followed everyone's advice and halved the amount of white sugar.  This recipe is excellent and everyone at my Thanksgiving table loved it.  At first I struggled to figure out how to cook the sweet potatoes (yams), but I referred to my Joy of Cooking book and they told me to boil the potatoes with the skins on.  Boil until you can pierce through to the middle with ease, tender but not soft. After they are done, remove from water and let cool.  Once they are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin.  I discovered it's easiest if you make a shallow slice down the skin and then peel it off like a jacket.  I prepared this dish the day before serving, and did not bake it until the serving day.

Very good latkas (or potato pancakes, depenting on who's talking).  They weren't quite a 5, but still good.  I'll make them again when the mood takes me. And do squeeze out as much water as possible, that is key.

This was fantastic!!! The only change I made was I added a little bit of cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture and I ground up the pecans in my food processor and added them to the streussel topping. I think it came out better that way instead of chopping into huge bits of pecans.

Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Made this as last minute choice.  Substituted canned sweet potatoes instead of cooking and peeling potatoes due to time.  Worked well.  Everyone liked.  No left overs.

This was an absolute hit! I fixed it exactly according to directions, except for the white sugar.   The topping is so sweet, that you only need half the white sugar. I used the recipe conversion utility to make this for 16 people, and it was such a hit! No leftovers here! :) This is my new thanksgiving day staple!

Absolutely Yummy! I made this for Thanksgivung and it was a hit! My 92 year old grandma even called me the next day for the recipe! My husband didn't think he liked sweet potatoes 'til he tried this! Some of the changes that I did: I only used brown sugar; I added some cloves and some nutmeg; and I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it is by far the BEST sweet potato casserole I have ever had! It was the first dish to go! I did add cinnamon and nutmeg as previously mentioned. Also, do add the sugar gradually to suit your taste as others suggested.

I made this this morning for our Thanksgiving dinner this afternoon! How's that for being stupidly brave!?! But I wasn't really worried. I used to make a recipe similar to this many years ago and it was excellent too. I know some have said this was too sweet...but I'm Southern. We like a little whatever with our sugar anyway...it seemed find to me! :-) It was simple... I baked the potatoes several days ago. Kept them in the fridge til I got ready for them, followed the recipe directions pretty much to the letter except that I probably let it cook 10 minutes or so longer, just because I was busy getting ready and it didn't seem to be bothering anything. It must have been aggreable to everyone, because the bottom line is that there weren't any leftovers! I will add that some folks suggested doubling the topping, and I don't know why...it worked out fine for me, using the 9 x 13 pan as the recipe says. Anymore would have been too much, I think.

This is recipe is my signature addition to the family Thanksgiving feast.  Occasionally I will suggest I try something new and the entrie family gasps in horror.  Delicious and very well-loved!  One suggestion....make sure your potatoes have cooled before adding the egg...seems logical, I know, but I learned that one the hard way!

Very good recipe. Since I was in such a hurry, I ended up using canned yams and drained it out, then I put some marshmallows on top. If you plan on using canned yams you want to test it out before adding sugar since the canned yams already have a lot of sugar on it. Its also good when you add some quick oats on top or corn flakes to give it a crunch.

This SPCasserole recipe has been the star player for the last few years at all three Thanksgiving dinners my husband and I go to!  And since I am asked to bring it year after year I am glad it is easy enough that I can whip up even juggling a very active 7 month old!  The picture doesn't do it justice- it turns out much prettier than that.  I also make additional topping, which makes it taste like Pecan pie- YUM!  I actually tried this recipe looking for a SPCasserole dish that would rival Damons Restaurants SP dish for my mom.  She thinks it's way better!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Friends at my Thanksgiving dinner loved it! The Pecans really added the ommppff. I used Yams instead of sweet potatoes, worked just as well.

This had a really good flavor, however, it was way too runny.  I also added marshmallows on top and that was really good.

This was outstanding.  I hate sweet potatoes and have only ever tried them in a casserole like this.  This was by far the best I have ever tasted and anyone that has tried this has raved about it.

* DELICIOUS !!!! *  I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving dinner at my mothers house. Mom usually makes candied yams but a couple of my family members wanted something different. I made this dessert without the pecans and added 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the mixture (just to make it a little sweeter) and also added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the topping mixture. Absolutely DELICIOUS! Without a doubt the best sweet potato dish Ive ever eaten and several others strongly agreed. Highly recommended! TYVM for sharing this recipe.

I forgot the vanilla (oops!) but this dish was still more than delicious. It's very light and the topping makes it really special. Everyone loved it.  This has replaced my old "candied yams with marshmallows on top" for all holiday meals. Thanks for this winner of a recipe!

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last week and it was awesome. I used 5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled, so the casserole would not be dessert-sweet (and so I'd have more leftovers!). It was the perfect flavor. The pecan topping provides a great crunch. I'll be making this every year!!

I used Sweet potatoes like the recipe called for - not yams...and I thought they were perfect and not too sweet.  I wondered whether some of the other reviewers had used yams..which I think would have been TOO sweet.

This was the easiest and most delicious sweet potato casserole I have ever made!  The topping was especially delicious.  I didn't use quite as much sugar as the recipe called for in the topping or the potatoes.  I substituted vanilla soy milk and squeezed some lemon juice over the top of the potatoes before adding the topping. (Next time I'll stir it in.)  Also, in place of butter in the topping, I used country crock spread and it turned out mushy instead of crumbly.  I ended up adding whole grain oats to it to try to get it closer to the right consistency.  In the end, it was so delicious that I will make it the same way next time!

Served this at a large Christmas gathering.  Many remarked that this was the best they had ever tasted, and such a nice change from the typical marshmallow variety.  Yummy!

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmmm..... almost enough said. Even my veggie resistant 10 year old son asked me if it was dessert. He really loved the topping or "caramelized pecans" as he called 'em. Five big, shiny stars for this one. There, enough said.

This was great... unfortunatly, I decided to make it as a side dish to go with stuffed eggplant (also on this site) which was lovely. It's a great flavour, but I didn't realise it was a dessert!! Did I miss something, or is this really a side dish in America?? Either way, I didn't make enough to feed everyone who wanted to eat it after thier first bite. It was a huge hit with everyone, even the very fussy who won't normally eat a vegetable!! Brilliant!

Outstanding!  Put a layer of marshmallows on before you bake, however and it is even better.  (Plus, kids are drawn to it.)

We don't usually serve any type of sweet potatoes for my husband's family.  However, I like them so I went ahead & made this recipe.  I got lots of compliments from everyone who tried it including my husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes!  I did reduce the sugar by a third and it tasted fine.

Got tons of compliments, but it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar (and fat) by half.

I wish I could give 10 starts to this recipe because it's really worth it. It was such a hit during Thanksgiving Meal that I had people asking me for the recipe. I had to make almost double the amount told for this dish and I had a little problem making the pecan crust to become crunchy. I fixed it right away by letting the crust broil for 5 minutes. It was GREAT and soooo tasty!! Thanks a lot.

We like alot of topping, so we doubled that.  But the potatoes themselves needed more butter and a little sugar mixed in.  Otherwise it was good.

Excellent!  I've made this recipe twice now, and all I get is rants and raves about it!  I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I doubled the topping both times.

Let's call this casserole what it is:  DESERT!!!  I would also recommend cutting back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and omitting the vanilla if you want to serve it as a true savory side dish.  Otherwise, I think the best accompaniment for this dish is a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!

I'm not a great cook, nor am I big fan of sweet potatoes, but I had to make something with sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving.  I made this and was very suprised at what a hit it was.  I even enjoyed it!  It's very sweet so if you're not looking for sweet, opt for something else.  But if you don't mind sweet, go with this recipe!

This was a good recipe but very sweet! I am usually the one with the sweet tooth but this recipe was so rich, I couldn't eat too much of it. I would suggest cutting down on the amount of sugar.

A HUGE HIT!  We tried this new recipe instead of the usual sweet potato casserole with the marshmallow topping, and we absolutely loved it!  The family went on and on about it requesting the recipe!  Thank you and it has become a favorite of ours as well!  Very delicious!

This was a big hit at at a Thanksgiving pitch-in.  However, I had to microwave the potatoes and it took a little longer than 20 minutes to put everything together.  I also would recommend you cook about 5 fairly decent sized sweet poatotes to get the 4 1/2 cups required for the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again.

great! Scaled this recipe to half, Blended three huge potatoes which I had boiled well over an hour in food processor, then combined other ingredients and added them in.  Used half the sugar called for and plenty sweet. I had a craving and it was very satisfied. Thanks.

After years and years of the usual sweet potatoes with marshmallows, my family has decided this is their favorite way to have sweet potatoes.  I've made them them last couple of years for Thanksgiving and Easter, and there is never any leftover.

I made this souffle twice.  Now I can't try any other one.  This one hit the mark.  Deliciousness abounds.  I thought I bought it from picadilly or somewhere else.  BUT I MADE IT.  Printed and will keep it for many future dinners.  Thank you for posting..

The only change I would make is perhaps a bit less sugar.  Given that the sweet potato is already a bit sugary I might cutting back on that a bit.  Otherwise it was  DELICIOUS, liked by our guests, and definitely one I will be making again!!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the potatoes because I use them when I  make candied yams. I think next time I won't use so much topping because it came out really sweet, but I love the recipe.

Came out perfect. For those allergic to nuts, I toasted the pecans for 5 minutes and those who wanted nuts on top can add them afterwards. That way the the whole baking dish will not contain nuts.

I’ve made this casserole many times over the years and my husband even prefers it over his Mother’s. The only changes I’ve made is that I roast the potatoes so they’re good and sweet and reduce the amount of sugar that I put into the casserole. Sometimes I switch out the pecans on the outside (and mix them into the casserole) and put marshmallows on top to please my MIL. My 1” daughter has even started using this

No one in my immediate family likes sweet potatoes, but Grandpa was visiting for Thanksgiving and really wanted them. My cousin suggested this recipe and so glad she did!  EVERYONE, including me, loved them!!! Might have made some sweet potatoes converts.

Usually, I do tweak a recipe as I go through it, but everyone started these rants about judging the recipes as is. This one I did verbatim. I don't like it. I know drowning something in sugar is usually enough for most people, but I needed more or different flavors which this didn't provide.  I can't offer a solution. I can only say this isn't what I was looking for, but in the right direction. Thank you.

This  recipe is very flavorful and delicious — and disappears quickly!  I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven (instead of boiling them) prior to mashing.  I also added extra brown sugar and pecans to the topping because I have a huge sweet tooth.  Everyone loved it!

I can't believe I haven't written a review for this yet. I've been making this for years. My family requests it every Thanksgiving since the first day I made it over 10 years ago! Great for people who don't like the traditional, overly sweet, sweet potatoes with the marshmallows on top.

We always cut the  butter and sugar in the potato mixture in half.   I love the brown sugar topping but the kids insist on Mamaws marshmallows.  So we split the topping right down the middle of the casserole!

Love it love it!   Mixed crushed pineapple and some pecans and marshmallow in the sweet potato mix.  Then did a layer of egg/brown sugar/pecans/butter/marshmallow across the top and baked the thing for 25 minutes.    Awesomeness

I made this with my granddaughter who is just beginning to cook. I may not serve this because it may be too sweet.  There are a couple of mistakes in the directions that I did not catch either.  There should be 4 steps, not 3.  The instructions for the custard and the topping are blended together in step 3.  For a novice, as well as someone (me) who was a little distracted making a pecan pie, this mistake was not caught so she added 2 cups of sugar...1 white and 1 brown.   I just hope it won't be too sweet because she is so proud of herself.  Oh yes, the word "sugar" does not show in the printable.

Misunderstood the directions and accidentally added the brown and white sugar in the main mix. Aside from it being extra sweet, it was also extremely runny. I'm not sure if this has to do with adding too much sugar? I used canned sweet potatoes, drained.

Light airy, the eggs make all the difference in terms of the weight of the finished product.  And the crispy topping adds just the right touch of sweetness.

Made this yesterday. Sorry, but I too made some very slight adjustments. Used ½ and ½ instead of milk, and ½ cup packed brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar. I have never made sweet potato casserole before but this recipe looked wonderful so I tried it. I brought it to a potluck dinner and everyone raved about it. Even the two women from "down south" gave it high praises and one had more instead of dessert! Thank you for a great recipe that I will make over and over and over again! Lunch lady Elaine

I've made this recipe many, many times during Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family never tires of it!
I don't like the taste of raisins after they are cooked, so I have experimented with a couple of variations that I would like to share. Everyone at my holiday table usually ask for second helpings!
I drain a small can of crushed pineapple and squeeze it out in paper towels to remove all the juice I can, then add a tablespoon or 2  to the potato mixture, I also add a little flaked coconut and dried cranberries, (all in amounts to your liking), and bake as directed. Really good!
I have also made the recipe, partially cook it without the topping, then fill small fillo pastry cups, topped with streusel topping and bake until pastry cups start to brown.
They make great bite sized "casseroles" when the menu is lighter!

I used 1/2 the sugar in the recipe and next time will use 1/4 (i.e. only sugar in the topping) unless it is for a dessert as that is what it tasted like to all of us.

I make this for every major holiday. I usually have to double the sweet potato goop. I use half white, and half brown sugar in the sweet potatoes, and cream instead of milk. It makes them super creamy and yummy. I've had people who do not like sweet potatoes try these, and they love them.

I  only used 1 cup coconut sugar and skipped the flour. Covered it with mini marshmellows. Soooo good! Tasted like dessert, like crunchy pumpkin pudding. It's a keeper.

I used about 2/3 of the sugar and I would definitely use less next time. I think 1/2 of the sugar called for. This is a delicious way to eat sweet potatoes & squash. Oh, I also used a butternut squash along with sweet potatoes. All in all, a hit with those who tried it.

This is excellent I made it both with fresh sweet potatoes and canned. The fresh version is so good! The canned version is barely edible... noticed someone in reviews says canned was good too. Definitely not! As suggested I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and doubled the batch of topping.

Didn't have any pecans, but I had some left over walnuts from a cookie recipe, I ground up a 1/4 cup of walnuts and added it to the white sugar in the recipe. Added strusel topping and mini marshmallows on top. Everyone loved it.

a little too rich for me. very tasty, but I thought it had more sweetness and butteriness to it than was necessary. Rather have a healthier version, where I can taste the goodness of sweet potatoes.

Yes I will make this again.  Did the sweet potatoes in the mircrowave and saves time and peels right off. Made for two and used only three potatoes.  Will cut back on topping next time.

I made the mistake of using Yams instead of sweet potatoes.  Next time, I'll make sure to usual actual sweet potatoes.  I baked them for about 90-120 min at 375 degrees, then scooped them out.  I baked it covered the entire time.  I think you definitely need to uncover and brown the top for the last few min of cooking.

Made it with the 3 most common substitutions suggested of using evaporated milk, brown sugar and white sugar.  I baked it the night before thanksgiving, cooled then refrigerated overnight and reheated in the morning at same amount of time and temperature suggested. It was perfect!

I  made this recipe by boiling the sweet potatoes in skin first  and didn’t change the recipe at all. DELICIOUS. My family and guests, and me, LOVED it and raved about it. Thank you for this delicious keeper recipe. It will be on the menu at all of my dinner parties.

Turned out great, it disappeared on Thanksgiving. Made a few changes as recommended by other reviewers. Baked the potatoes first then mashed them with cinnamon and nutmeg as well as evaporated milk instead of regular. Kept the rest of the ingredients the same. The crunchy sweet pecan topping was fantastic. I will definitely make this again!

It was ahuge hit, however I didn't need to make the mashed potatoes like I make mashed potates. I added milk and butter and then added the other ingredients. It was a little watery because of that. So if you just boil and mash without extra milk and butter, it is amazing

this was so easy to make & really delish.  I baked the sweet potatos & peeled & sliced them. Dotted  with butter &  some  nutmeg  and cinnamon,  and toasted pecan pieces & sprinkled over the top, covered with foil  & baked.  Just loved it!!

I sent my sister in law to pick up some pecans.  She accidentally came back with glazed pecans.  It ran them through my food processor and it worked very well.  I’m not a sweet potato fan, but this dish is outstanding.

Delicious!  Do not sub brown sugar for the white w/the sweet potatoes.  I found out the hard way that it turns the orange flesh an ugly brownish color.

Delicious! I followed the suggestions to substitute brown sugar for white and to double to topping. I also used 29 oz cans of sweet potatoes rather than fresh. Fresh might be better but it was excellent and so much easier with canned. The only other change I made was to toast the pecans before making the topping. I made this two days ahead, including the topping but left out the butter from the topping until the day of serving. Then I mixed in the butter to the topping, spread it over and put back in the fridge for a few hours until I was ready to bake it. It turned out great and the topping stayed very crisp. The recipe as is makes plenty and would be enough for 12 people plus leftovers easily. Super easy and delicious!

Love this recipe! We used slightly more pecans than suggested and added marshmallows to half for the last 10 minutes. This is a great one for those who love sweet potato casserole with or without marshmallows. Will make again for sure!

One of the best dishes on my thanksgiving plate this year! The only minor change I made was using 1/2c brown sugar & 1/4c white sugar bc there seems to be mixed reviews on the sweetness level. It was PERFECT!! Pecan topping (no marshmallows) added the perfect crunch & flavor pairing as well!

This was the hit of  our Thanksgiving dinner!!!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, and half-and-half instead of milk.  The nutty, crunchy topping was amazing!!

This is the recipe I've been making for years!  My mom made this for Thanksgiving for the first time probably 35-40 years ago and I've had it for T-giving ever since (in fact, just whipped it up for tomorrow).  The best ever!!!

This is a good recipe, however the first time I made this I added all of the sugar to the mix, instead of just the white sugar, as it did not specify (just says add sugar to mix...) until later in the recipe the brown sugar was for the topping. Huge problem when cooking for a diabetic family and can't get out.  Please correct this in the recipe so no one else has this problem.

This was excellent everyone loved it! I did half the sugar and even that seemed to be more than enough. I think I would cut it to 1/4c next time.

I have  made this casserole using canned sweet potatoes and again for Easter 2018 with butternut squash.  The recipe was doubled both times with no leftovers.  I replaced the white sugar for brown, decreased it by half of a cup and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  When doubling, the topping does not have to be doubled as well.   Super easy and delicious recipe!

I have made this a few times and it’s always a hit! But this time, I changed a few things and everyone said this was the best I’ve ever made! First, I microwaved the potatoes because I find it’s too runny when I boil them and they were hard when I baked them (I think they weren’t moist enough). In my crust, I added about 1/2-3/4 cup of oats and some cinnamon. It was sooooooo good!!

Excellent casserole! I halved it and cut back on the sugar added to the sweet potatoes with no problem. A reviewer mentioned that there was a ton of topping. Since I put this into a small deep 1 qt casserole dish, I cut back on the amount of topping which worked fine. Instead of putting it all on top, I put half of the sweet potato mixture into the casserole, topped with half of the topping, and repeated. If not having this as part of a meal, it could be good as a dessert with a little whipped cream!

I made this for Christmas dinner instead of my traditional candied yams. My roommate loved it and I liked it, too. For my taste, however, it has too many ingredients. Call me boring or old fashioned, but I think I'll make it simpler next time and see how it turns out.

This was absolutely delicious! I doubled the potato mixture (I had too many potatoes & nothing else to do with them), using 1/2 a white Sugar & 1/2 Brown Sugar. The topping I kept as is (didn’t double it), and it was perfect. Would definitely make again.

Oh, YES! I configured the recipe to 10 servings and should have stuck with the full recipe LOL. It was gobbled up and I was hoping there might just be some leftovers for my hubby and me but nope, ALL gone! I wasn't sure how it would go over since I didn't think anyone liked sweet potatoes, but boy was I wrong. I microwaved the sweet potatoes, easy peasey, and let them cool before mashing them up. I reduced the white sugar to half of what the recipe recommended and could have reduced it even more or substituted brown sugar in  lieu of the white. Do get the orange sweet potatoes/yams. This is a winner!

Omg. This was amazing. I made it for my family I do not like sweet potato anything. I followed the recommendations used brown sugar instead of white and used half the sugar in the receipt. I subbed evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I put it in a 9 by 8 the cook time was 3xs as long. But this was amazing was a hit with everyone I tried it and liked it a lot as well. Perfect sweetness perfect creamy texture. I give it ten stars.

I made it with the canned sweet potatoes and mine turned out kind of runny. I’m not sure why it was runny, I assumed because of the canned sweet potatoes but the flavor was great! Any advice to fix this would be greatly appreciated!

The reason I made this was, I burned the sweet potato's in the oven ( cooked to mushy ) so then found this recipe for mashed sweet potato dish. Boy, am I glad I did. Everyone raved about this dish. The only dish that was completely empty.  The topping was so good. Will be making this again.

Really good.  Like, really good.  Very sweet so it could be more like a dessert if you wanted to serve it as such.  Good enough that after I made it for Thanksgiving, my picky Southern Baptist mother in law specifically asked me to make it again for Christmas, which I will be doing!  May try reducing the sugar at some point for health reasons but for now, this recipe is a keeper.

I usually like my sweet potatoes more savory  but I made this for thanksgiving minus the white sugar- the brown sugar was plenty.  Half in the dish and a little more than half in the topping.I ralso added 1 chopped shallot because we love them and it was delicious! None was left unfortunately. This will definitely be a permanent recipe for me.i microwaved  fresh potatoes for this recipe

Perfect as listed. I halved the recipe and used 3 fresh NC Sweet Potatoes. Even had a little extra left over. Will make again. 

Note when adjusting the recipe that the directions do not change so they need to be changed manually. It can get confusing.

Very good. But way way to sweet. Cut back on sugar and even can cut back on topping (especially sugar) if put in a deeper casserole dish.

MAKE SURE YOU USE ORANGE POTATOES!
This would have been better if I would have used traditional orange or even red sweet potatoes.  But, due to mislabeling at the grocery store and me being rushed and not paying attention,  I ended up mistakenly getting the sweet potatoes which have the light yellow/white flesh. ?? They are more starchy and have less flavor...which was not so good!  I even baked the potatoes to get as much flavor out of them as I could.  The family liked it,  the pecan topping was good, but it definitely would have had more sweet potato-y flavor with the orange potatoes.

Followed the recipe. It was really good. In my opinion, I think you can cut back on the sugar in the topping.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!   I did make a change as I'm trying to cut back on my sugar intake so I only used the brown sugar amount that the recipe stated and it was still plenty sweet.   My 6 year old granddaughter said it was delicious and named it "our pumpkin pie".

My first time to ever make sweet potato casserole and this was such a hit with me and my son (it's just us 2, okay?!).  I couldn't believe how delicious it was and that it was so simple to make.  I will be making this going forward for each year for Thanksgiving AND Christmas.

Everyone loved this even those who did not like sweet potatoes. I used half the sugar and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I'm already getting requests for Christmas.

Outstanding. I did make a few changes. I used 2 29-oz cans of yams (drained). I omitted butter from the main dish (not the topping), as one reviewer who has made the dish many times said it's not needed. Instead of 1 c. white sugar, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. stevia -- trying to minimize sugar for a diabetic family member. Next time I will try using 1/2 c stevia and no brown sugar, just to see how it works.  The topping has brown sugar, so that may be enough. I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the main dish. Sprinkled flour-brown sugar mix on top of layer of pecans, and topped with melted butter. Prepared the day before. Removed from fridge about 1/2 hour before cooking. Delish! A big hit all around.

Love this easy recipe!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out deliciously.  I used one can of yams and halved the recipe.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans.   I usually cook my yams and make a thick gooey sauce.  I wanted to try something different this year.  I'll be making this again for sure!!!

Loved it!!! I made for Thanksgiving and this was a hit! I made this with canned sweet potatoes, and instead of white sugar I used 3/4 C of brown sugar. The only problem I ran into was the butter ( I had country crock) for the topping. Instead of getting crumbly topping I ended up with a softer texture of topping (assuming butter needs to be stick butter) which I still used!  It still turned out great! The sweet pot. was just right with the topping having a crispy bite. I will be using this recipe again, thanks for posting!

I added a 1/2 tbsp of allspice, 1 tbsp of cinnamon and and extra 1/2 tbsp of vanilla extract. All the extra depth in seasoning meant we didn’t miss anything when we cut the sugar in half (only using brown sugar) Result: A new favorite. Thank you, Mary48!

This will now be my go-to recipe for sweet potato casserole! Just made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. Like some of the other reviewers, I used canned sweet potatoes  (drained) and it turned out fine. For the butter, I made sure to use melted butter for the sweet potato mix and only softened butter for the topping mix. We usually don't prefer nuts in the dishes we make, but I think for this one, the nuts were necessary and perfect! So delicious, thank you!

With two minor adjustments, this was a favorite at our Thanksgiving dinner and already requested for Christmas dinner. Following the suggestion of others, I used less than half the white sugar and also added some salt which perked up the flavor considerably.  It’s a side dish that can be made well ahead and held for a while because the topping keeps the heat in so well. I took it out of the oven at 1:30,  covered it tightly in foil, put it in an isulated bag and it was still piping hot at 6:00!

This is THE best sweet potato casserole around.  I have made it every Thanksgiving for the past 8 years.  It is always the absolute hit of the dinner.  I didn't make it one year and, boy, were there some grumblers at the table. :)

Awesome! This was very easy to put together and tasted great!  I used some maple sugar that I had in the potato mixture instead of the regular sugar and that was a nice addition. The topping was so delicious too. Hubby does not like regular sweet potatoes, but he loved this and said I could make it anytime...a keeper~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made it substituting evaporated milk for regular milk and light brown sugar for regular sugar. It was fantastic. My family loved it. Will make it again.

This casserole has been a hit at our Thanksgiving table for several years. I did use fresh sweet potatoes, and cooked them ahead of time in the microwave to save time. Also at the urging of my daughter-in-law, I completely eliminated the white sugar and doubled the vanilla extract. Although I was skeptical, I must say you could really taste the flavor of the sweet potatoes. I used a little extra brown sugar in the topping to compensate for the lack of sugar in the potatoes.

I used 6 cups of cubed sweet potatoes for our large group and cut the white sugar back to 1/3. Excellent casserole, and none left over.

This is amazing !!!I added coconut to it to give it a bit of a crunch. Hubby loves it i decreased the white sugar a bit because of the brown sugar topping. If you haven't  tried this you need to. Almost tastes like a dessert!

Excellent! I did make one change- I used maple syrup rather than white sugar since that's how we Vermonters roll. However, when I make it again I'll substitute cinnamon for the sugar instead. The topping is plenty sweet and we enjoy the flavor of the sweet potatoes. Totally worth a try.. this is a great side dish for holiday dinners!

This is addictive! Even though I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving, I couldn't stop eating it and ended up eating this instead of pie for dessert too.  It is very sweet but so so good. You could probably use a little less white sugar in the potatoes and not miss it. I cheated and used two large cans of drained sweet potatoes. This will definitely be a tradition for Thanksgiving in our house!

Yummy.  Instead of using the topping they suggested, I used marshmallows.  I put them on at the end of the baking time and toasted them on broil.

Great for Thanksgiving.  I think it could also be used in a pie shell!  I halved the sugar and butter in the potato mixture but kept the topping the same.  I roasted the potatoes at 350 for 90 min in foil which created nice syrup that I included in the potato mixture.  Also added some sprinkling of cinnamon.  Delish!

Wow!!! This is the best ever.  I took it to Thanksgiving lunch and everyone raved about it, even my nephew who said that he doesn't like sweet potatoes.  This is one that I will keep and make again and again.  I followed the recipe but I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and a dash of salt.  After I added the pecan/ brown sugar topping, I gave the top a light sprinkling of cinnamon.  Soooo good!

Good recipe, though I'm not sure why it doesn't have some spices added to it. I added ground dry spices in the following proportions: 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp clove, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Also doubled the amount of vanilla, substituted light brown sugar for white sugar, and doubled the topping (because it's delicious!). Family favorite!

Be sure to read ENTIRE recipe 1st & do NOT add all ingredients at 1 time. I forget each year. It is a great recipe just need to bread down into main dish & topping.

I've been making this recipe for more than 10 years and it never disappoints. I have recently started to make the crumbly topping without pecans as my daughter is allergic. It's smooth, sweet and delicious. It practically replaces pumpkin pie.

I made this today for the first time and it came out great. I made half the serving size because it was just for my husband and I. He liked it and that's a plus because he's very picky. I'll be making this again. Perhaps I'll make it at my jobs holiday potluck. Thanks for this recipe.

My family Loved this recipe!!  I also followed the exchange of sugar for maple syrup and found it to be perfect!  Seriously simple and made it the night before which I LOVE!  Easy and delicious.  Even the little ones ate it up! I was asked to make it at every dinner so its a keeper!  Thanks!

Awesome. The kids love it and I usually make with half the sugar and no brown sugar topping to save calories and sugar.  We've made probably 10 times and they ask for it all the time now.

I make this for every special dinner.  For me, I whip the sweet potato mixture in my large mixer.  It makes it so light and fluffy when it's finished.  I have never had anyone dislike this recipe!

I made this recipe for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. Turned out perfectly and I even used two big cans of the cut sweet potatoes. The topping was delicious!

Really impressed with this but will do a quarter cup less sugar in the potato mixture next time. Used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.

The whole family loved this. I used canned yams, strained and microwaved for 5 minutes before adding it to a mixer. The only changes made to the ingredients were substituting truvia brown and truvia white sugar, for the sugars and using gluten free flour. I also skipped the pecans and put walnuts over half. One half teaspoon of cinnamon and a little nutmeg was sprinkled on top.  So good!!!

I actually messed up. I forgot to add the eggs ( even though I mixed eggs for it) I also used sugar instead of flour in topping. It was so delicious. My kids won't eat candy yams, but loved this. The family actually said it tasted like pumpkin pie. I added cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg to yams. I will definitely be saving this one. That's to whoever shared it!!!

We made it just like the recipe stated. The only problem we have is we have to double the thing just to be able to have leftovers. It gets taken home by guests a lot. It is just as good the next day. We find ourselves making it for events and never bringing any home. Thanks, this hits all the right taste buttons for a whole lot of folks.

I usually make this dish from this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I made it for the first time 4-5yrs ago and it was a family favorite from the start.  To be honest, I was unsure if I was going to like it or not but I made it based on the star rating and reviews.  One of the best decisions that I've ever made.  Thank you!

So delicious! I served this at Christmas dinner and everyone complimented the dish. It was perfect. I did make the following minor changes:
1. 3/4 brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar
2. 1 tsp vanilla essence instead of 1/2 tsp
3. added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg + 1/4 tsp allspice
4. roasted sweet potatoes instead of boiling them

i made this, and it was a hit. I did, however, change a few things. I roasted the potatoes prior to mashing them[not steamed]. Instead of using half a cup of white sugar, I used brown .And instead of regular milk, I used canned condensed milk[ half a cup].AMAZEBALLS!

This was an excellent dish! After reading many of the reviews, I decided not to add a whole cup of sugar to the sweet potato mixture. I only put in 3 tablespoons of sugar into the mix, and let the sweet topping carry all the sugar. I'm glad I did. The topping is so sweet and the yams are naturally sweet.  I also didn't measure the sweet potatoes in cups, I just used 6 fairly large yams. It served 8 people (almost everyone went back for seconds) and I had about 3 helpings leftover.

Great recipe. My family loved it, very creamy and yet has crunch from the topping. I baked the potatoes for flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.....no changes. Perfect!

These were phenomenal. We made them for thanksgiving and everyone was saying they were the best dish of the night. I doubled the recipe and it took an hour to bake. I also cut the sugar by 1/3 and used half brown sugar in the casserole instead of all white sugar.  So delicious and tastes wonderful leftover.

I used fresh baked pumpkin, and even though I forgot the milk the recipe turned out fine. I think the pumpkin might be moister than the sweet potato? Loved the recipe. Thought it might be too sweet with  1 cup sugar and the streusel, but it was fine.

Made this today.  Baked the potatoes in the oven.  Misread the recipe and put 1 cup of light brown sugar in the potato mixture instead of white sugar. Added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the potatoes and doubled the topping as suggested in another review.   Also topped with a small handful of mini marshmallows in the last 15 minutes in the oven.  Everyone loved it.  Going to make this from now on.  Loved it!!!!!

I made big changes.  I baked the sweet potatoes but only used 3. I added sweetened condensed milk (half a can) and added only 1/4 cup brown sugar, pineapple chunks, cinnamon, and nutmeg to it.  I also increased the vanilla to a teaspoon. I completely cut out the white sugar, but added the two eggs. I made the topping as instructed but added a little water to make it more crumbly and I chopped the pecans up finely to it.  So yummy!  Not overly sweet, but just the right amount and flavorful.

Yummy! Adjusted the recipe to 35 servings the first time for my son's school event.  The second time was even better with an adjustment to 6 servings just for me.  I did not make any substitutions in the recipe. The crunchy texture of the pecans complements the sweet potatoes and sugar. This will definitely become a go-to dish for gatherings.

I made it exactly as stated. The flour mixed with the brown sugar made it taste too floury on top. Was not impressed. I would use much less or no flour, just add the pecans and brown sugar on top separately.

Always a crowd pleaser.  One year, by accident, I put in the sugar twice and everyone was raving about it.  Little too much sugar for me personally.  The family loves it.

I love this recipe, I find it a bit sweet though so I usually half the amount of white sugar. I usually make it as is but for a nice change I substitute half of the milk for bourbon and add a bit of cayenne to the topping makes for a great side dish for Thanksgiving.

I used four small/medium sweet potatoes.  I baked mine.  I went exactly by the directions, using all the measurements as stated. I did use brown sugar in lieu of the regular sugar the recipe called for. I also added 1 heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of Nutmeg.  

And let me tell you how WONDERFUL that butter streusel topping is!  Yum, yum!  I do not care for pecans, so I omitted them.  I simply mixed the brown sugar with the flour.  Then, I cut little cubes of my (solid) butter and tossed it together.  I baked it for 40 minutes, because like someone else said, I too love a crunchy topping.

This recipe is a keeper.  It's worth the time to make and it's fun to make, too!

THANK YOU to Mary48, for sharing this.  I will definitely be making this again.

I had some leftover sweet potato mash that I didn't need for pies so I cut this recipe in half and quickly made it for Thanksgiving dinner a couple hours beforehand. It turned out to be the star side dish! I'll be making a large amount for Christmas. I drizzled honey over the top before baking as well for an extra layer of sweet flavor. So good!

We've made this for Thanksgiving 2 years running while living abroad in Spain. It's a huge hit, though sometimes we have to substitute walnuts because we can't find pecans. So, so good, even reheated. May reduce the sugar content because I think it is a bit sweet for the Spanish pallet.

I made the pie for Thanksgiving and it turned out delicious and picture perfect!  After reading the reviews I sprayed my cast-iron skillet with nonstick spray and every piece came out of the pan just right. I also tossed all the apples with the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl instead of dividing it in halves. I added extra cinnamon nutmeg and two heaping tablespoons of flour.  I will definitely make this pie again it was very easy and delicious. I did have to cook it 10 minutes longer than the 45 mins suggested.

I made this recipe for our family's Thanksgiving gathering.  It was a huge hit!  The only two minor changes I made was to use two 29-ounce cans of sweet potatoes, and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the cup of white sugar.  The topping I increased by 50%. I like this much more than the recipe I use that requires marshmallows.  I will definitely make this again, probably for Christmas Eve.  I

I added less sugar. About 3/4 cup. Added cinnamon. For the topping didn't use flour or butter. Just sprinkled chopped pecans and a little bit of brown sugar. The sweet potatoes have their own sweetness.

I made this for my new office for our Thanksgiving sales meeting.  I used 2 lg cans of Yams, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, used evaporated milk, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and clove, doubled the pecans but not the mix.  I made it the night before, but melted the butter for the topping, mixed it, then put it in the refrigerator, then put it together the next morning and cooked it.  The topping mixes better with melted butter and crumbles better if it's cold.  This was the hit of the dinner.  I highly recommend it even for those who don't like Sweet Potatoes or Yams.  They all thought I was a gourmet cook.  That, I am not....  I've made it from the recipe for family gatherings and everybody loved it, but this year I'm changing it up like I did for the office.  It's been a big hit but I have to say these changes made it the best I've ever done.

I was OK but far too sweet for my taste.  Need to reduce the amount of sugar in this one.

I used canned sweet potatoes. Must not have used a large enough can. This came out like a very thick soup. Was disappointed in the texture and it was way too sweet.

I made this recipe for our family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. The white sugar may be reduced by half without changing the texture or taste. The eggs lighten the heavier texture of the sweet potatoes. It will become a tradition with us.  PatJ

We love this recipe and use it all the time, though I only use half the sugar it calls for. It was way too sweet, unless you are looking for a pie-like treat instead of a veggie side dish.

I made this recipe as directed except I reduced the amount of sugar mixed into the sweet potatoes by half, and used brown sugar instead.  Everyone loved this dish at our Thanksgiving dinner, and requested I make it again at Christmas!  I can see this becoming our go-to recipe when making sweet potatoes in the future.  Sure beats the marshmallow yuck I've had in the past!

This was a huge hit this past Thanksgiving. Both my sister and nephew called me the following wknd and wanted the recipe. My nephew (who doesn't 'care' for sweet potatoes), had 2 helpings at Thanksgiving! They wanted the recipe so they could take it to his girlfriends house that wknd to impress her mom...!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving, and accidently mixed all the ingredients together (except pecans) before baking. So I took some marshmallows and sprinkled them on top of the pecans and it turned out perfect.

I thought this looked good, but sugar content was off the chart!  I cut the white sugar in half and added 1/4c of stevia to the mash.  I then cut the ingredients for the streusel topping in half.  Also, I used Land O Lakes Light butter.  Turned out beautifully!  Plenty sweet enough...everyone said it was best sweet potatoes ever.

This is so good, I was eating it right from the bowl. Just made this to take to Thanksgiving dinner. I had to make enough for 25 people, so I boiled the potatoes. It may be better if you bake them, but it was still the best I've ever had!

I have used this recipe for years, my family loves it!  My kids don't like any other type of sweet potatoes.  It's creamy, not overly sweet and the crunch from the pecans is fantastic.

Delicious!!!  I wanted chunks for sweet potatoes so I left the yams/sweet potatoes whole drained right out of the can (2 39 oz cans)and I only used 1/4 cup melted butter and used 1/2 cup white sugar. Omitted the milk but still follow recipe for vanilla extract. I followed the crumb topping as directed.  People where asking for the recipe.  It was so good.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. Only way I really like sweet potatoes. It tastes more like a yummy desert than a vegetable casserole. The pecan topping is the best part. I just made this for our Christmas dinner this year and my sister kept going on about how good it was. I told her I make this every year and she admitted that she never tried it before because she doesn't care for sweet potatoes. She got busted!!! Now she's a fan. :) Everyone raves about how good it is.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was a big success. I did however use half and half instead of milk-and I cooked it a tad longer to make it slightly more crunchy on top.

I just made this recipe a couple days ago but I cut it in half just to test it out. It was soo easy to make and absolutely delicious! I am already boiling some more sweet potatoes to make the full recipe! The only thing I added was a pinch of pumpkin spice to add a little more flavor. I love what it did to the taste. Thanks for sharing! :)

Excellent - everyone loves this.  Can't say it's low on calories, but to make it on special occasions is SO worth it..and easy!

I made this the other day for a party and doubled it. I did enjoy the flavor of it but the sweet potato part was too sweet and I didn't use full cups of sugar. I would leave the topping as is, maybe add cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll make it again, cut the sugar, maybe do 1/4 white & 1/4 brown sugars. Not really sure why the recipe calls for melted butter since my sweet potatoes were hot from boiling them, maybe if you use canned? I used room temperature butter for the topping.

Made this Thanksgiving day and it was a hit. Don't tell mom, but I'm making this at my house instead of candied yams w/ marshmallows. It's not as messy either! I doubled the topping as suggested and it was great!

When I made this recipe the first time I thought it was too sweet. The second time I made it I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar. It turned out great then!!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it will be added to our future feasts.  The recipe was easy to follow and I didn't change a thing.   I prepared the sweet potatoes the day before and mixed the rest of it up a few hours before we ate and baked it a couple of extra minutes to make sure it was baked all the way through.  Also good the next day!

This was excellent! Instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of raw sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I used 3/4 tea spoon of vanilla extract.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk. In addition , I baked it in little Custer dishes for individual servings.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving!  I will make it again for Chritmas, but might add marshmallows on top next time.

Excellent!  A little on the sweet side, so I would likely cut out the sugar in the potatoe mixture next time and just keep the topping sweet.

I made this as the recipe says and it turned out perfect! I ended up boiling about 6 large yams to get the 4.5 cups of mashed yams. The texture was very creamy inside and crumbly on top. This definitely beats the old marshmallow toasting.

My family loved this recipe for thanksgiving.  I used 1/2 cup fat free half & half in place of the milk and eliminated the sugar from the mash, since the streudel on top is already sweet enough.  My 18 mo old and 3 year old both gobbled up healthy portions too.  This recipe is so creamy and flavorful, and very easy to make.

My mother insists that I make this every Thanksgiving.  It's amazing.  I don't measure my sweet potato or my milk.  I just add til it looks right.  Recipes have always been just kinda guidelines for me and mom. lol.  I also add a little cinnamon. And instead of mixing the chopped pecans with the butter, flour, brown sugar mixture.  I decorate the top of the mixture with whole pecans.

Very good but I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice and some cinnamon to the mashed sweet potatoes.  It just gives it a little more of the traditional holiday flavor that everyone loves.  I think I will definitely make it again though, incredibly tasty with the pecan topping!  I recommend it!!

Perfect!  I kept the pecan halves whole which gave us the unexpected benefit of kids actually eating it since it was easy to remove the pecans!  Always a consistent winner in our house.

Wow!  I just made this.  I cut the sugar & butter in half for the portion that was mixed in with the sweet potatoes before the crumble. All the other stuff, I followed the recipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, but made a ramikin so that I could try it!  It was delicious!  I can't wait to serve it to my guests!

I made this for Thanksgiving and I got so many compliments for it! I made double the topping and added the teaspoon of vanilla and salt as others suggestions. Really wonderful dish. Much sweeter than a normal vegetable side, but fits in really well with Thanksgiving flavors!

This recipe is very nice but very sweet, and I even cut back on the white sugar by a 1/4 of a cup.  Seems like a very good Thanksgiving dish.  Next time I may cut back on some of the brown sugar in the topping as well.  I saw another recipe that added crushed cornflakes, so I may try that if I cut out some brown sugar so the topping still goes as far.

This recipe was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Sweet potatoes and yams are naturally pretty sweet, so I omitted the 1 cup of white sugar. I recommend tasting the potato mixture before adding any additional sugar. The crumbly mixture on top was enough sweetness for me. I substituted chopped almonds for the pecans and it was delicious!

Everyone LOVED the topping, which compliments the sweet potato texture more than marshmallows. I finely crushed the pecans and even the non-nut fans enjoyed this dish. My family will make this over and over.  Sweet and yummy!

The sweet potato part is really, really good. The topping, however was MUCH too sweet. It was an overwhelming amount of sugar for the amount of potato. I would cut it by a 1/4 next time, or skip it altogether. I'm normally a person that loves brown sugar, and its saying something that it was too much for me!

It was good, probably too sugary. I accidentally made the topping too mushy instead of crumbly so it was basically impossible to spread on top, I ended up having to just mix it in to the potatoes which didn't make me happy. I'll try things differently next time. Thanks!

I made this for Thankgiving and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was I used about 1/2 cup of sugar instead of a full cup and I did make a little more of the brown sugar topping so it would pretty much cover everything in the 9x13 pan I used. My boyfriend who isn't even a fan of sweet potatoes loved this dish too. It was awesome.

Really good.  A bit sweet... I think I'd cut the sugar in the sweet potatoes down a bit next time. Also topping needs more butter for the crumble.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as is except added a little less white and brown sugar than called for. Came out delicious like a cross between a pecan pie and a pumpkin pie! Oh, and I added cinnamon at the behest of my cinnamon loving boyfriend. Will make this again for sure!

I have made this for years. When a group I belong to is making a cookbook, this is one of the recipes I am instructed to contribute. I often use mashed squash (butternut or Hubbard) instead of sweet potatoes. My brother who says he doesn't like squash likes it this way. I suspect it would make a wonderful crustless pie if made with pumpkin instead.

Yum!!  Although we loved this casserole dish I have to rate it a 4 because we all thought that it was to sweet.  I will definitley make it again but with about 1/2 the recomended amount of white sugar next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a Home Run wit the entire family!  I just cut down the sugar a bit because it was too sweet.  This has now become a new Thanksgiving tradition in my home!

Yum, yum, yum.  This recipe is so wonderful.  I also love that it is vegetarian.  I have such a hard time finding vegetarian recipes that the whole (meat eating) family will like.  This year at Thanksgiving, I'm following the advice here: http://www.ehow.com/how_5677469_enjoy-thanksgiving-vegetarian.html to make it a good time for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!

This casserole is holiday comfort food at it's finest! I've been making it for several years now and the only change - reduced the white sugar by half. This is very sweet-my DH loves it as a dessert. Canned pumpkin works well. You could kick it up a bit with some spices but it truly does taste divine just as it is. I serve it at every southern-style Christmas dinner I host.

I got this recipe from a friend with a slight difference: they added a small can of crushed pineapple and in my opinion it TOTALLY made this dish! My brother was already a huge fan of traditional yams with marshmallows but he gobbles this stuff down every Thanksgiving so much that it dominates any leftover space on his plate, with several more helpings to boot. I don't think I'll ever make a sweet potato casserole any other way again.

Delicious! I just slightly altered it. I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar in with the potato mix. I took others advice and made extra topping.  I'll definitely make it again!

My family always made sweet potatos with marshmellows and not many of us cared for it, so i brought this dish to Thanksgiving about 10 years ago and it has become a family tradition. They call for the recipe if i am not around to make it for them.

Excellent -- this dish got loads of compliments at Thanksgiving dinner!  I agree with other suggestions to cut down the white sugar. I'd start with a couple of tablespoons and just add gradually to taste, especially since the topping is very sweet.

This is delicious, but I must warn you, that it is like a dessert and very sweet.  I only added 1/2 cup of sugar, and it still was too sweet.  Probably won't make again, but thanks for sharing.

I made this for Easter and my 7 year old daughter thought it was dessert.  Only changes I made were that I used 2 29 oz. cans of sweet potatoes instead of fresh and I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  And since my Mom is allergic to gluten I omitted the flour in the topping.  Absolutely delicious!!

I'm rating it a 4 only because it made way to much and I didn't get to enjoy it much as I was the only one to eat it. But its a very high 4. This is the recipe I've been looking for for many years now. My mom had made this once and I loved it! She never made it again and couldn't find the recipe. I will definately make this again however I will reduce the portion to 2-3 and put the brown sugar after its done baking as it was hard to cut into it. Thanks for sharing and I almost guarantee the rating will go to 5 next time I try it.

First time I made this it was good (4 stars)-- a fancy mashed sweet potato, but the 2nd time I doubled the nuts and added an extra egg, and it was much better (5 stars) as it had more texture and was more like a casserole.

I would recommend twice as much topping.  I liked this and even my husband, who hates yams/sweet potatoes, said he would eat this again.  I would make this again to go with ham or turkey.

This casserole had a good taste and was pretty easy to make.  It was a nice change from the regular sliced sweet potatoes that we usually have for Thanksgiving.  Next time I will keep it a bit chunkier, because my family wasn't a big fan of the smoother texture.

This was very good as the recipe is written - most in my family really enjoyed and now request me to prepare it for holiday meals.  I however think the butter flavor is way too strong and overpowering, so I adjusted it to not crumble the butter on top.  There is plenty in the casserole mixture itself.  Depending on what your family enjoys you can make the call.

A friend tried this and loved it so we had at Thanksgiving. My family LOVED it. My husband asked for this from now on.  I baked the potatoes in foil and then mashed as one reviewer suggested.  Wonderful flavor and easy.  Thanks for the new tradition.

Really, really good.  (Although I made with about 6-7 cups yams and only 1/2 cup white sugar.)  This will definitely become part of my thanksgiving repertoire.

Update- My original review was in 2008. I have made this recipe MANY times and tweaked it to make it the best ever!  1st, some of the reviewers say to bake the potatoes instead of boiling them.  I've done it both ways and I prefer to boil them they do not taste better baked but NEVER used canned potatoes that will make a HUGE difference!  I use at least 3.5-4 lbs. of potatoes.  I whip them in a kitchenaid mixer with the flat beater.  All the strings from the potatoes stick to the beater so I'm able to remove them - this makes the mixture smoother.  2nd, always use whole milk.  I have used evaporated milk, etc - whole milk is always better.  3rd, I also add a few light dashes of cinnamon to the potato mixture.  4th, on the topping I use 2 C. brown sugar, 1 C. flour, 1/2+ C. pecans and I keep the butter at 1/3 C. sometimes I may add a little more (1 T. or less) so the topping resembles cookie dough.  Put it in a 9x13 pan and spoon the topping across.  There will be a lot but it's worth it!  Then bake for about 30-35 min. until the top is brown but not too hard.  I have made it the night before just do the potato mixture as written, spoon it into the pan you are going to bake it in, wrap it up and keep it in the fridge.  The next day all you have to do is make the topping and bake (45+ minutes) and it turns out just as great!  This is my family's favorite dish and now with all these changes it's the best ever!  People are always wanting this recipe!  I hope this helps you!

This was the best sweet potatoes my family has ever had.  It went over very well.  I added mini marshmellows to the potatoes just because I had them and it worked very well.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and got rave reviews. It was even declared the star of the dinner. After preparing it according to the recipe a few days before Thanksgiving, my husband and I decided that it was too sweet and seemed too much like a dessert. So for the day of we halved both amounts of sugar making it much more enjoyable. Everyone loved it. I will be making this every year. Super simple too!

I took another reviewer's advice and baked the potatoes instead of boiling; saved time by throwing them in the oven with whatever was cooking and preserved the great flavor! The only change I made was to use half brown and half white sugar in the taters just as a taste preference. The topping was delicious and hard not to gobble up by itself. My family raved! Fluffy, sweet, and delicious!

The biggest hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!  I halved the amount of white sugar in the sweet potatoes and used the full amount of brown sugar in the topping.  It was just the perfect sweetness.

This was delicious though I made minor changes.  Instead of milk, I used half and half.  I cut the white sugar back to ½ a cup and used another ½ cup of brown sugar. I also added nutmeg and cinnamon.  I made 1 ½ batches of the topping, too.  

I would HIGHLY recommend using fresh sweet potatoes, not canned.  And make sure you bake them without foil.  

This dish is still divine the next day, too.  I just ate a small plate of it for breakfast.  The topping doesn’t get mushy, still crunchy and yummy.

I married into a family of extremely picky eaters.  A few years ago the Thanksgiving torch was finally passed from my mother-in-law to me.  It is now my quest to get Thanksgiving back from bland to fabulous.  I found this recipe because in my heart I knew there was a better alternative to canned yams!  I am so glad I tried this.  It is soooooo good!  I used evaporated milk as one user suggested and it was very good.  I also added mini-marshmallows over the pecans during the last few minutes of cooking for the kids.  While I could not convince some in the family to even try it, everyone who likes sweet potatoes loved it.  We did manage to convert one person, and I will definitely make it again next year.  And I am not worried about the leftovers because it means I get to eat it for breakfast tomorrow!

I wanted to try something besides the canned yams with marshmallows and brown sugar this year, so gave this a try, and am so glad I did! I used about 4 large yams (instead of sweet potatoes, because that's what my husband came home with - apparently they were marked incorrectly at the grocery store!).  This was very good! It is quite rich, so next time I may try to cut down on the butter slightly.  This is going to be on the Thanksgiving menu from now on!

This turned out totally delicious! We decided to forego the pecans and instead used Honey Bunches of Oats brand "Just Bunches." The only problem was that the brown sugar mixture was too clunky, but it ended up working out.

Normally, sweet potatoes are put on our holiday buffet more for tradition than taste.  I made this delicious casserole for Thanksgiving and over the Christmas holidays, and there were no left overs.  The only minor changes that I made were to incorporate 1/2 and 1/2 instead of regular milk, and I toasted the pecans before I mixed them into the topping.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok, so I made this at Thanksgiving and Christmas and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it. I loved this dish and my man couldn't get enough of it! I did double the topping portion and exchange the milk for evaporated milk as others had suggested. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I think that this became as instant tradition in our house as we couldn't get enough. I can't wait to make it again this year.

I made this for a potluck at work and it got RAVES. What's even better is I work in the midsouth, the sweet potato casserole capital of the world, and the ladies I work with said it was the best they've ever had. One lady wanted to take home the leftovers, but there weren't any!  So I shared the recipe with her and told her, to her surprise, that I used canned yams and a mixer like some have suggested in the reviews.  I must say...It was fabulous!  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

This was just delicious and very simple to make.  It would be a wonderful dish to bring to a holiday celebration.  Leftovers also heat up beautifully.

It was very good. Next time I'll use less sugar. Also the pecans don't taste well reheated the next day; will substitute.

Made this in no time.  I didn't have the pecans for the topping mixture.  So I put about a cup and 3/4 of marshmellows on top to completely cover the sweet potatos.  When it popped out of the oven they were a beautiful golden brown.  Delicious!

I expected this recipe to be the tops with all the rave reviews but I honestly found it to be a bit bland. I followed it as written except I used walnuts instead of pecans since thats what I had. For anyone who makes this after me, I recommend following some of the others advice and adding maply syrup or sweetened condensed milk. I will try that next time and it definitely needs a little kick to heighten the flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family thought it was tasty.  All agreed the topping would have been better with either plain marshmallows or a combination of the two.  I substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar for the 1 c. of white sugar.  I just can't bring myself to use that much white sugar in sweet potatoes. I will make this again with modifications.

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it.  They took leftovers home and called me upset when it was all gone!  I, like others baked the sweet potatoes and used less sugar and added marshmallows (my brother's favorite) to the top.

This was really good, but next time I don't think I will put as much sugar in it.  It tasted a lot like dessert.

This recipe was really easy and it tasted really good, so a definite keeper in our house.  Be careful with the sugar though - be sure to add only the white sugar to the potato mash and reserve the brown sugar for the strudel on top.  The recipe doesn't clarify that and I added the brown sugar to the potato mixture and it was too sweet.  My own fault, but just something to watch out for!

I followed the recipe and reduced the sugar per the suggestion of several others. I actually did not enjoy this recipe. It was easy to make, but there was no wow factor to it for me. I was expecting more of a dessert flavor, instead it was rather bland, and the topping was not cohesive, it seemed like it's own separate afterthought. In the future I will serve sweet potatoes baked and topped with butter, or try a more decadant recipe that calls for maple syrup and marshmallows.

This is a SUPER SUPER recipe! I have been making it for almost 3 years in a row and I get asked to bring this at every holiday gathering. 
The topping is really what makes this dish - and using really great sweet potatoes of course!

This is our new sweet potato recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving this year and followed the recipe exactly except I did add a little pumpkin pie spice to the potato mixture, about 1/2 tsp. with a little cinnamon. Let me tell you, do not be afraid to leave the marshmallows behind, my husband was bummed when he saw there was no marshmallows and after he tried it he never wanted me to use them again.

This was excellent! I used fresh sweet potatos and boiled them until soft then mashed.  I left out the eggs (personsl preference) and I doubt it made any difference in the taste.

a cute way to serve is to hollow out oranges,  fill the skins, top with the crumble.  I've made this a bunch of times.  Some alterations, additions, a little orange zest, and some times i've used a splash of bourbon.  You can also add some of the pecans to the potatoes them selves.  Delicious recipe.

Oh my Goodness!
This was one of the best recipes I've ever made from this website! This could win an award!

I made all of the afore mentioned changes, and actually cooked it for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated, and it was delish!
NOTE: Don't worry if your topping isn't hard right away. It will harden as it cools.

5 Stars! Everyone asked me for this recipe! It's my little secret now though!

I hate sweet potatos but my sister made this and it was soooo good!  She mixed in nutmeg and cinnamon for added flavor.  And she kept out the nuts in a part for me because I am allergic to them.  But it was delicious, I will make this again soon!!!

It was quite delicious.  I did cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  I think next time I would cut it to 1/3 cup.  Based on prior comments I added 1 tsp vanilla instead of the 1/2 and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  If you are looking to cut fat, I don't think it really needs 1/2 cup of butter, but since it was Thanksgiving I added it.

What a hit at our Thanksgiving! My fiance isn't a sweet potato fan, but he loved this. I made a few changes to keep up with some of our dietary issues: I used a liberal amount of sugar-free maple syrup instead of white sugar, brown Sugar Twin in place of brown sugar and one cup of applesauce in place of eggs. Delicious!

The flavor was okay, but not outstanding. Cinnamon and brown sugar would have improved it.There was too much butter in the topping; cutting back would improve the texture.

This was my first attempt at baking such a dish for my latin family and everyone loved it!!  This recipe had the perfect amounts of flavors with the added suggestion of adding the cinnamon, nutmeg and even topped it off with marshamallows.  This was delicious and I will definately make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got a lot of raves. I even overheard my Mother say that they were the best sweet potatoes she'd ever had. I think the best reaction was when I made my hubby-to-be try them--and he doesn't like sweet potatoes. He had a weird expression on his face and when we asked him "Oh, you don't like them?", his response was "Actually, they're pretty good". This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The whole family enjoyed this for Thankgiving.  I also used evaporated milk, and some extra spices in the potatoes, but the big hit was the yummy topping!  Thanks for the recipe!

If you like sweet potatoes you have to try this recipe.  Make sure the potatoes are fully cooked so the texture is smooth.  My brother does not like sweet potatoes and said he enjoyed this recipe.  I forgot to add the vanilla but it turned out great.  Would be nice if calories could be cut without compromising the flavors.

I thought this was a very good dish. The topping was not as crumbly as i expected it to be while putting it on the sweet potatoes, before baking. But it turned out to look very pretty when it finished baking. It did take a bit longer to bake than called for, but my oven is older so that might be why. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to the sweet potatoes before putting them in the casserole dish. I think that is the only thing this recipe is lacking.

Very sweet, but fantastic!  It was so sweet even that I cut down the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  It still turned out great and fluffier than anticipated.

Very good.  My daughter is allergic to tree nuts so I omitted those and they were not missed.  The casserole was light and fluffy;just the right thing with ham. My family loved it.

I've never had sweet potatoes like this. I loved this recipe. I peeled and chopped a bunch of sweet potatoes in the oven until soft. Then I mashed them up and started the recipe. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and added a bit of Myer's Dark rum. It really added a niec flavor to it. I added the topping and cooked it according the recipe. My husband said he loves this recipe.

My Word!!  Took this is a Thanksgiving dinner where no one said they liked sweet potato.  They all changed their minds when they tasted this recipe.  Outstanding.  I took others advice and changed a few things.  replaced milk to evaporated milk, reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, increased vanilla to 1 tsp., added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Also double the topping recipe.

Sweet potatoes are so full of vitamins and soooo much better for you than potato.   Also I can't eat potatoes - because they're nightshades. 

I made this for Thanksgiving tonight and Wow!  This was GREAT! It surprised everyone especially ME.   I'll be making this more often!   Next time I will cut down the sugar in the sweet potatoes.  I think the topping is already sweet enough.   Thank you for the recipe!

I couldn't decide whether to use this recipe or the Sweet Potato Casserole I, so I combined the two.  I used 1/4 cup of melted light butter, 1/4 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp salt (probably didn't need it) mixed in with the mashed potatoes.  I skipped the topping all together and just mixed 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and the chopped pecans in with the potatoes.  It turned out great with much less sugar and  butter.

I made this for Thanksgiving and just finished emailing the recipe out to two friends--they loved it.  I made it nearly as written - just went a little lighter on the white sugar.  This is definitely my favorite version of this casserole.  I've made others that were way too sweet and too fluffy.  This one has a great texture!

This was a delicious recipe!  I live overseas where you cannot buy sweet potatoes but I had a large can of candied yams and a can of pumpkin.  I used a little less sugar because of the candied yams and I added a little nutmeg and cinnamon.  I will definitely make this recipe again!  My husband said that he liked the pumpkin mixed in better than straight sweet potatoes.

Really great!Everyone loved it. Looked at others suggestions and made a couple of changes.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup which was plenty.  Also, sprinkled a little nutmeg and cinn. over potatoes before putting on the topping.  Topped with a few marshmellows for fun.  This was a great recipe and enjoyed by all!! Thanks for entering it!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was an instant hit! Some said it was a bit to sweet while others absolutely loved it. (I think I will cut back on the sugar a bit next time) But other than that it was absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was  a big hit! I used a deeper casserole dish (corningware 2.5 liter) rather then the 9x13 baking dish... I used about 7 large sweet potatoes and cut the sugar by 1/4 in both white and brown... this helped with the sweetness. Because of the size of the dish I used I'll cut down the amount of crumble topping to make... I cooked this the night before and then reheated topping with mini marshmellows in the last 5 minutes.

I used Splenda in place of the white sugar to cut back the calories a bit, as well as 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 in the potatoes and it was very good. Next time I will cut back the amount of white sugar though, probably not using more than 1/2 a cup, if that.  It was almost too sweet.  The man who printed the recipe off for me had brought it to the office and added 1/3 cup of rum in it as well.  That was a nice addition.

OK, I've used this recipe for the past like, 5 Thanksgivings so I thought I would write a review (not that this recipe needs another glowing one).  Everyone goes coo coo for this casserole every year and I am now DEMANDED to make it :-).  Of course I have to add marshmallows too, but it would certainly be amazing without them.

Ok, I have made this twice already!  One for Thanksgiving and since we didn't have any leftovers, my boyfriend wanted me to make another for just us!  This is such a good recipe!  I had a little more sweet potatoes than the recipe called for, about 6 cups and I didn't sprinkle the entire streusal topping on otherwise I think it would have been too sweet!  I kept the leftover topping in a container to sprinkle on baked sweet potatoes at a later time.  Other people might like all that sugar on the top but I don't.  The sweet potatoes were sweet enough.  Very fluffy!  Everyone loved these so I will be making them every year!

Very Sweet! I loved it- my hubby did not- he likes things a little more savory- you may even want to put it in a pie crust and serve it for dessert.

Very good.  Took the advice of others and watched the amount of sugar I used.  These are just as good the second time (if not better) and I wouldn't think twice about making these a day ahead of time for a gathering.

This recipe is SO GOOD!  Everyone at Thanksgiving just loved it and begged for the recipe.  It was simple and so quick and easy.  I baked the potatoes the night before, then I just had to throw everything together and bake before dinner.  I did follow other recommendations and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  Superb!

This was unbelievably good. I made this as a side dish on Thanksgiving and it won rave reviews. Two things: first it makes enough for a crowd so if you have many to feed this is perfect and it was incredibly sweet. It almost could have been dessert. I will make it again, thanks.

We love this recipe.  I have shared it with two families and they both asked for the recipe.  We will use this to replace the yams that we usually eat on Thanksgiving.  My husband likes more topping, so I doubled the topping.

HUGE hit!!! a must for any gathering.  a little sweet for my taste but im the only one who said so out of 10 people.  the only thing i did different was sub-ed the sugar for brown sugar and added some cinnamon.  keep this one a secret so you will be the popular one!!!!

I tried this and it was wonderful!!!  It made way too much for just my husband and I  and I cut it in half. We had plenty of leftovers but it tasted better each time I reheated it.  I plan to use this recipe this week when the in-laws come to vist!!!!  It will go great with grilled Iowa pork chops.

I served this with chicken marsala last night and it was absolutely delicious.  I only added a 1/2 cup white sugar and it was perfect!  I will make this many times in the future.  A keeper for sure.

I'm reasonably sure I'd give this recipe 5 stars if I'd baked it at the recommended temperature and time.  I was warming a fully cooked ham at lesser temperature, however, and tried to adjust for that -- less than successfully.  Flavor was great, but texture left much to be desired.  Rather soggy.  Perhaps next time I'll try baking it ahead of time, and then just re-warming it for dinner.

This recipe is good, however, I used brown sugar instead of white, 4 oz. of cream cheese instead of milk, a teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. This was a big hit at my office Christmas party.

this is the dish to win over non-sweet potato lovers!  i used canned yams (2 40ozcans) and changed the 1 cup white sugar to 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown sugar and it turned out great.  i ran out of sticks of butter so i used margerine for the butter for the top mixture.  it turned out more of a paste than crumbly but i just spread it on and it turned out fantastic!  like a glaze.  wonderful dish!

This is my new favorite sweet potato casserole. Very easy and a great alternative to the marshmallow covered kind of sweet potato recipe. we don't really like pecans but they tasted great with the brown sugar mixture! I scaled this down and had a little trouble figuring out how many sweet potatos to use but the flavor came out great!

Delicious! Can't go wrong. Different look than the traditional sweet potatoes but great taste. Sometimes I make with nuts, sometimes without. Either way, the taste is great!

Delicious! I added just a bit of cinammon, and next time i think i will cut back on the sugar. But i know i will be making this again. The only problem was, was that it was really sweet, so i could only eat one serving. I would of like to of had more. What? Im doing weight watchers, it was Thanksgiving, i was trying to us all my extra points for the week.

Topping very sweet and there was plenty of it - almost 1 to 1 ratio of potato thickness to topping thickness.  I would cut the amount of topping I put on next time but overall it was a wonderful dish.

This is a GREAT recipe for sweet potatoes!  Rave reviews & no leftovers.  It's now my job to bring sweet potatoes to Thanksgiving every year!  My husband, who has never cared for sweet potatoes, had 4 helpings!!  I made this ahead of time & popped in the oven to warm right before dinner.  Travels well!

I would give this an extra star if I could... I made this for our Thanksgiving supper. I said I would bring the sweet potatoes. I was told that sweet potatoes are what I bring FROM NOW ON. Everyone RAVED over how great this was, and I must say... It was great! I didnt have seconds of anything BUT the sweet potatoes! They are awesome and I will make them every thanksgiving, and whenever I have a meal that will go well with this. They ROCK!

 I did add some ciniman to the potatoes and to the strusel, just because. It turned out wonderful. Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe!

This was so easy to make and came out deliciously!  I cut the amount of sugar used in half and it was still very sweet.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner, I'd definitely recommend it.

A big hit! Kind of a cross between and casserole and a pie. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and folks had seconds and thirds. Even my hubby loved it and eat normally doesn't like sweet potatoes. I use walnuts instead of pecans.

This is just like my mother in law's. I love it and it is always asked for. I used canned yams (drained) and cut back on the sugar since the yams were in heavy syrup in the can. I had to cook a bit longer in my oven. Incredible!!!

I wish I could give this recipe more stars!  It was a hit with EVERYONE.  The things I changed were instead of 1 c. white sugar, I used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c brown sugar.  I also added a little sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg.  This recipe will definitely be our family's new tradition!

For a family of people who do not care for the sweet potato and nuts this dish sure went quick!     It was perfect and not too sweet.    I only wish I had made more.

Lately I've taken over Thanksgiving cooking responsibilities for my extended family and sweet potatoes are a must.  This recipe was absolutely unbelievable.  I added more pecans.  My 85 year old grandmother said they were simply delicious.

Awesome! That's what even my Southern, great-cook mother-in-law said about this dish. Some people announced they liked the streusel topping better than the usual marshmallow topping. I used 2 40-ounce cans of yams (drained) and added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and an extra 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I kept the topping as-is. Perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were good, but to me still a little dry and needed more flavor. But all in all a good recipe.

My 10 year old son would never eat the yam casserole with marshmallow topping served at Thanksgiving. We live near Gilmer, Texas where fresh sweet potatoes are grown.  I tried this recipe and he loved it!  Now i make it throughout the year.

Will make you want to cry in your turkey it's so good. I used heavy cream instead of milk and although it was much more fattening, it really gave it a great flavor. I also threw some bourbon in the streusel topping last time I made it but it really doesn't need it although it added a twist on the flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make.  This made a great side dish to our London Broil.  Definitely on the sweet side so I may try cutting the white sugar in half next time as I don't think it will affect the overall taste.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon but may add 1 tsp next time along with a little nutmeg.  My family loved it (and my 4-year-old even asked for thirds!).  Even the leftovers reheated well which makes me think that it can be easily prepared ahead of time.  This one's going in the recipe box!

If I could give this 6 stars I would!  I did cut the sugar in half. It was the talk of our Christmas dinner.  My husband's 97 year old great aunt said they were the best sweet potatoes she's had in over 60 years!!!

I made this last Christmas and it was a BIG hit!  I also made more traditional candied yams in case no one liked this but there was no need.  Everyone loved this recipe!  I added a bit of nutmeg & cinnamon and cut back the sugar a bit.  Fabulous. I'm making it again this year by popular demand!

WOW!  All I can say is YUM!!!  I made these for Thanksgiving and people who swore they would never eat sweet potatoes were eating seconds and thirds.  My husband wanted to put vanilla ice cream on top! He said they were good enough to eat for dessert!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  I'll be making these again for sure!!

I made this casserole last Thanksgiving and again this year because everyone LOVED it so much!!  The only change I made was to add more pecans on top and it comes out perfect every time.  Very easy and it is the first dish to disappear.  If you are making sweet potatoes, this is the only way to do it!!

This is the ONLY dish that was completely gone by the end of Thanksgiving lunch.  Everyone, but me, loved it.  I thought it was good but very very sweet.  But, like I said, there where no leftovers with our crowd.

I made it again this year. I added 3/4 cups of sugar and didn't do the pecan topping (can't have nuts) and it was perfect! Thanks!

I found this recipe 2 Thanksgiving's ago.  It was a hit.  I made it today for a Potluck we had at work.  I was asked for the recipe, and had to come print it out.  Didn't realize I hadn't left a review.  It's FANTASTIC, easy to make, and sure to become a family favorite.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband, who rarely ate sweet potatoes previously, and then only when they were baked like a regular potato, surprised me by asking me to make this when we were hosting a dinner for his business associates - and they loved it too.   My 3 yr old son cannot get enough of this dish. 

The topping is very sweet and the almost reminds me of the topping on apple struedel.  YUM!

I made this with canned yams. It turned out great. It is sweet, but the kid's loved it!!!! It didn't seem too sweet. I also put marshmallows on top. Thanks for the new recipe.

Very sweet. Wonderful side dish. I wouldn't use it as a main dish because it is very rich.

This recipe is so delicious!!  I replaced some of the sugar in the sweet potoato mixture with maple syrup which really adds to the taste.
