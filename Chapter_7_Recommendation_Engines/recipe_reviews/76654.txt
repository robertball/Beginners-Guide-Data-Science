This isn't the real Canadian poutine recipe - you use cheese curds instead of shredded Cheddar. However, I tried it, and the difference just doesn't compare. You can find cheese curds at a specialty grocery store, dairy, etc. It is also recommended that you make your own gravy for best results, overall I wasn't impressed with this recipe, it turned out mushy too. Will not be making this again.

OMG I love poutine and freaked out when I saw this recipe. I like to deep fry fresh fries and I buy poutine gravy from Canada but it is more like chicken gravy then beef and you cant get the correct cheese in th US but cubed white chedder works best. You can buy St. Hubert poutine gravy mix online as well as cheese curd. You have to have it the right way to appreciate it.

Poutine was originally created with cheese curd and real beef gravy. This recipe is incorrect and I suggest you do some research on poutine if you would like to try the real deal ;) It's very delicious with cheese curd- cheddar cheese is wrong. You MUST use white cheese curd or you're not having poutine.

This a bland, lazy interpretation of poutine. If you are planning on making poutine, do yourself a favor and look for a better recipe.

Gotta love the real thing though :)

Tweak your ingredients for...
-Home made french fries
-Cheese curds
-BBQ sauce

Best results with, home made fries (not the frozen type). Cheese curds room temperature and preferably fresh from the day not refrigerated (squeaky factor is a must!). The BBQ sauce has to be thick, we have poutine sauce back home (a mix between gravy and bbq sauce)

Rule of thumb preparation: mix cheese curbs with the hot fries and poor the warm sauce on top of everything. Don't drown the fries. Some top it off with a handful of curds. Also, consider serving in a bowl. This may sound crazy, but hey
! We invented Poutine in Qu√©bec.

Fun fact: McDonalds actually tried to add poutine on their Canadian menus in Eastern Canada / Quebec. No need to say they have failed miserably.

Enjoy!

Poutine is not made with cheddar cheese anywhere in Canada, to make real poutine you have to use cheese curds, they aren't any more expensive or difficult to find than cheddar cheese, so there's no reason not to make them correctly.

I live in New Jersey and around here these are called disco fries!  We use mozzarella instead of cheddar and I sometimes opt for the gravy on the side for a less soggy fry.

I LOVE poutine, and it just isn't the same with frozen french fries and canned gravy. I do my poutine like this sometimes, if I'm just looking to spend a few bucks at the grocery store, but nothing compares to homemade fries with homemade gravy and cheese curds!
EDIT: something that would make this taste better is if you deep fry the frozen french fries according to the package directions, instead of baking.

This may not be "real" poutine, but for someone who has never eaten the Canadian version, this is really good. I did not use canned gravy. Instead I made the Simple Beef Flavored Gravy recipe from this site. It turned out really good! Thanks for the recipe! I will make it again.

I love poutine but poutine isn't real poutine unless you have real cheese curds. It's not poutine unless it does the "squeak, squeak!".  I also use St-Hubert BBQ gravy (you can buy it anywhere even in Walmart in Lloydminster, AB!!!)

I had poutine for the first time last summer in Canada and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had some really good gravy left over from a pot roast last week which needed to be used, so I thought of poutine.  Yes, the real deal does have cheese curds, but tI've never seen them anywhere in my area.  I thought the shredded cheddar worked O.K.  as a substitute.  I used Ore-Ida's Cracked Black Pepper & Sea Salt Frozen Fries which  held up well to the gravy.  Don't mean to sound snooty, but I would never use canned gravy.  However, whenever I have leftover beef gravy, this dish most likely will be made.  With the gravy mentioned above and garnished with some sliced green onions, we thought this was 5 stars.

This is probably more appropriately named "Cheese Fries".  Poutine is actually made with cheese curds and beef gravy as others have stated.
That said, in a pinch, it is a perfectly acceptable substitute and one I can make at home!

Ths is not "incorrect" If someone makes chili with turkey it's not wrong, it's a different version! French canadians tends to use cheese curds, but everyone I know uses shredded cheese, and I prefer it this way personally! Shredded cheese melts to gooey perfection while curds clump and don't melt as well.. Try cheddar cheese, or marbled for a variation. I just finished eating a big bowl of this and it really hit the spot. Pure Canadian comfort food! lol

We love chips and gravy. The addition of cheese takes it to another level. I put the whole thing under the grill to speed up the cheese melting. Thanks for the post!

sorry but i have to agree with everyone else.  i currenlty live in montreal, qc and here "real" poutine is made using poutine gravy (which is probably hard to find anywhere but here) fries and mozarrella cheese curds.  if you are lucky enough to get a taste of poutine from quebec, all other poutine will never be the same.  i have a close friend in albany and i mail her poutine gravy every so often.  apparently, she can't use anything else!

Real French-Canadian poutine must be made with cheese curds. The cheese should go on the fries and then be covered with the hot gravy (to ensure that lovely melting). Don't knock it 'till you've tried it!

It's OK, but I've always prefered home made fries (with the skin on) to store bought ones.  Also, I have to admit that the cheddar cheese curds really do add that je ne sais quoi to an authentic poutine.  That being said, it really is just fries, cheese, and gravy, so have fun with it and experiment!

The standard poutine does indeed use cheese curds rather than shredded cheese. However, you can make it however you want to as long as fries, cheese, and gravy are included. The best poutine I've had in Canada uses shredded mozarella and cheddar cheeses and it's far better than the standard cheese curds. Shredded cheese melts much better than cheese curds and because of that more fries are coated with the cheese. While it may not be the standard version, many restaurants in Canada make it that way.

I am originally from upstate NY and we always ordered out french fries with gravy.  When I migrated to NC and ordered them that way I got funny looks.  I tried this adding the cheese and it is a nice finishing touch.

This sounds like an alright recipie but to make a really good poutine like they sell here in canada you should use either mozzarella cheese or cheese curds.

I  used "Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries" and made my own beef gravy.  Having never been to Canada to have the real deal I'm not sure what the actual taste should be.  This was good fries with good gravy with good cheese but I kept wishing I was eating cheese fries with bacon, green onion, jalapenos, and ranch dressing.

We even have Poutine available at Burger King here in Nova Scotia. Its great comfort food. However, I haven't ever had it made with cheddar cheese; we use mozzarella cheese or cheese curds and we always use chicken gravy. I'm thinking that the beef gravy and cheddar cheese variation is pretty good too though. Yum! :-)
