The recipe was probably four stars as is, but I made some changes and it was DELICIOUS! First, I used egg noodles instead of spegetti. I used shredded chicken that I had left over from the night when I made enchiladas. The meat was seasoned up already and was great. I used fresh mushrooms (sliced), added frozen corn, used cream of celery instead of chicken broth (just add the cream of celery and ¾ of a can of water), left out the pimentos, added 3 sliced green onions, and put ground pepper on the top of the cheese (I used Italian cheese and cheddar-and prob about ¾ of a cup total). It was delicious! The kids loved it, my hubby loved it and the left overs were great too! ?

This is a good recipe, but after making it a few times I have found a few tricks to make it better.
Drain the pimientos over the mushrooms in the same colander. 
Instead of using canned chicken broth, stir 3 tsp. chicken boullion granules into 2 C. boiling water.
Cook the Roux for 2 - 3 minutes before stirring in the liquids.
Add the parmesan with the liquids. (reserve some to top with if desired)
A few miscellaneous things that work to add flavor (sometimes together, sometimes separate): add 1 tsp. minced garlic or 1/2 tsp. garlic powder; add splash of white wine; add either more white pepper or a pinch or two of coarsly ground black pepper; and use freshly grated romano to sprinkle on top.
I've also used tuna instead of chicken with great success. Use 3-4 cans of tuna in water.

YUM! I didn't have heavy cream...substituted sour cream and the white sauce turned out absolutely cravable. I used italian seasonings and for speed pulled chicken off a pre-made rotisserie. Big hit with my kids. I added romano and mixed it throughout as well as on top. My kids are not mushroom eaters, but even sans veggies this is great with a salad and bread to scrap up every bit of delicious sauce! Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have anything but milk, so I used that, and it turned out great.  I also added parmesan cheese-freshly grated.  I spread mozzerella cheese all over the top.

Bf really liked this.  I was okay with it, but white sauces and mushrooms don't do it so much for me, so we'll go with bf liked this.  ;o)  I used cream only bc I had some I needed to get rid of, and it worked extremely well.  Bc of the comments of it being bland, I added seasoned salt and garlic powder to make it pop a  bit.  Worked just great.  I used both parmesan and cheddar as a topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome!  My family said it's a "keeper."  I made it for alot of people, so I poured half the recipe in a 9" by 13" pan, sprinkled a cup and a half of parmesan on top and repeated with the rest of the recipe.  I also added seasoned bread crumbs to the top...yum!!!

With a few changes from past reviews this was a HUGE hit! It was a great way to use up some left over chiken from the evening before.

This was good although I would break the uncooked spaghetti into halves or thirds before cooking. It is of course not a low fat recipe and not one to eat often due to that, but lower fat versions are available. I would like to give them a try to compare.

VERY good. I only used 1/2 jar of pimentos and 1 can of mushrooms. I cooked 1/2 and froze 1/2 - I can't wait to cook the frozen one and enjoy it again!

This was great! My family loved it. The only thing I left out was the pimentoes because my family does not like them. Also, I used whole wheat pasta. I will definately make this again and again.

YUMMY!  The only thing I did was add a little more salt, but that is because I am a salt-a-holic according to everyone.

I made it for the first time tonight.  I read all of the other reviews and made a couple of changes.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of in a can.  I put in 3 onions.  I didn't put in the pimientos (I don't really care for them).  It was an excellent dish.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was all gone by the end of dinner.  I paired it with some freshly made bread.  =D

I followed the recipe exactly and we found it to be bland. The taste is not worth the fat content ;-)
