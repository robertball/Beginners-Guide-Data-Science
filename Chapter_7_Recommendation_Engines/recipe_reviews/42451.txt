Way to punch up the underappreciated green bean! I didn't measure ingredients, just kind of eyeballed seasonings to taste. I blanched the beans for about 5 minutes, put them in an ice bath to stop the cooking process, then simply added them to the vegetable mixture and heated them through. For added color I used orange and red bell peppers as well as red onion. We really liked this creative take on green beans.

Very good, strong tarragon flavor.  I didn't use salt-free lemon pepper and I was grateful for the salt.  The celery and green pepper adds some nice texture to the dish.

A good recipe to use fresh tarragon if you have it. I used red pepper instead of green. It gave a nice color instead of the drab green that you otherwise get.

Loved this! Very easy and delicious with Curried Rice Pilaf and Tilapia with Pineapple Salsa. We used a red pepper instead of green which made it more colorful. The spices made for an excellent flavor. We used frozen green beans and it worked well, but we overcooked. When we make this the next time, we won't cook the frozen beans as long.

Delicious! They were perfectly cooked. I didnt have green peppers so I used a few orange bell peppers Instead. It was delicious. No leftovers for these veggies. Even my husband who hates green beans and onions ate them and said they were good. He didnt take seconds but the fact he ate them at all was a big deal.

I really liked this; but to make it really great there are a couple of changes that need to be made. First I used olive oil instead of margarine because it's healthier.  Secondly 3/4 tsp of tarragon is too much; it drowns out the flavour of the veggies I only used 1/2 tsp and I might even cut it back a little more, my lemon pepper seasoning had salt in it and like another reviewer I too thought it needed the salt.  Over all it was well received and I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Fantastic dish, used fresh tarragon.  Made for 100 servings for a Mother/Daughter Banquet at our church. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Introduced numerous people to Allrecipes.com.  All the dishes I prepared for the meal for the last 3 years came from this website . Each year I try something different and always have positive results.  Thanks everyone.

Well, the topping was very good, but the beans themselves were watery and bland.  I think gently steaming them and skipping boiling would really help this dish out.  Also, maybe a bit more tarragon as it was hardly noticed.  Hubby gave this just 2 stars, but I think fixing the beans could make this 4 stars, as it wasn't THAT bad.

This is a great green bean recipe. I used fresh tarragon, and omitted the lemon-pepper seasoning and they were so tasty! The sweet flavor of the sauteed celery is a perfect compliment to the beans, as well as the tarragon. Will definitely make this again.

I will make this again....I had fresh tarragon on hand and I may have used a bit too much much though, as it was almost too overpowering.  I do not care for green peper and left it out....didn't miss it at all (of course).  I sauteed the onion and celery, then just dumped in the bag of frozen french cut green beans and let it simmer...turned out great.

These are a great variation on traditional saut√©ed green beans. They go great with fish because of the tarragon and lemon pepper. I served them with beer battered cod and corn fritters. Yum!
