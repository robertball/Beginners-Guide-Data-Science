Very easy to make for a yeast bread.  It didn't need too much time to rise, and it made three fairly large loaves.  It has a sort of mild taste, so if you want a lot of flavor, this is not your recipe.

This makes a very tasty bread. Slightly sweet and soft. I did not have any rye flour so I subbed an extra cup of whole wheat to the recipe. Next time I will try it with the rye. My family loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy, makes 3 good size loaves--well, probably 4.  I made this in my bread machine but failed to look at the amounts prior to starting, so I ended up with a rather sticky dough since I couldn't fit the last cup of whole wheat flour in the bread machine.  My fault, certainly; there is no reason I couldn't have halved it, which is really what I should have done.  But, oh, well, no harm done, and I ended up with a somewhat hearty but not too hearty loaf (hubs didn't complain, always a huge plus) that worked well for sandwiches and toast equally.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time working with rye flour and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. The dough rose well and the texture wasn't as heavy as I was expecting. I think when making again I might reduce the honey slightly as the bread was just a touch too sweet but that's just personal preference. Thanks Denise.
