Had a craving for rice pudding but doesnâ€™t agree with me these days.  Thought I would try this recipe.  Was not disappointed at all.  Delicious .  Made a few changes .... used almond milk (regular flavour), brown sugar instead of white for the pudding.  AAWhen doing the nuts I used natural cashews as I had no pecans.  My husband and I loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Going to try with whipped cream.

I will make this again it is really amazing one thing I will do next time for sure is temper the eggs the first time I made it I had sweet couscous and eggs!! the next time I tempered the eggs and it turned out amazing!! for those who do not know how to temper eggs you add a little of the couscous and milk mixture to the eggs a bit at a time to bring the temp of the eggs before you add it to the mixture. ENJOY!!

I'm a lover of rice pudding so I thought I'd give this a try.  It was good, I did not have fat free milk so I substituted 2% and I only made the pudding not the  pecans to go on top  because I was only using what I had in the pantry and there were no pecans although I'm sure they would have added a nice sweet crunch.  It was creamy and good and I would make again.

This was a unique way to use up left over couscous. It was creamy, and the texture was similar to a rice pudding. I liked the touch of pecan brittle pieces on top. Thanks for sharing
