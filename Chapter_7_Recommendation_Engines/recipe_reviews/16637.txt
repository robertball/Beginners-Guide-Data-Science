A little clarification please...Does 15 graham crackers mean 15 sheets (of 4 crackers each)? I thought that it meant 15 crackers so I don't think that I had enough graham crackers in mine. Also the 8by8 pan of cookies did not work really well but that might be because I did not have enough crackers.

These were absolutely delicious!  I followed the directions to the letter and they came out phenomenal.  I will change just two things next time, though:
1) Instead of forming cookies, I will line an 8x8" baking dish with wax paper and pour the batter in, then put it in my fridge to set.  These cookies tasted exactly like fudge, so why not make them look like fudge?  I think it would make life a little easier to do it that way.
2) I will not crumble the graham crackers to dust.  I think leaving bigger pieces in there would be delicious, as they absorb so much liquid and soften.  Not leaving bigger pieces was MY fault, though.  The owner of the recipe said to crush them until they are small pieces, not turn them into dust. :)
All in all I am extremely happy with this dessert and ever grateful to the creator.  Great job!

Yum! These were great! I halved the recipe, reduced sugar and peanut butter, added peppermint extract, and used chocolate grahams. They were sooo good! I boiled the chocolate mixture for about two minutes and they set just fine. A little on the sweet side, otherwise Deeeee-lish!!!

Quick and easy with very minimal-staple- ingredients.  I went ahead and made it the "fudge" way in an 8X8 pan.   I used fifteen SHEETS of graham crackers - broken by hand - into a mix of dust and pieces.  Threw in a pinch of salt and used just a bit less sugar.  It doesn't present very well, and is rather "crumbly". It's just alright and did it's job taking care of my sweet beastie - however, seemed to be "missing something."   Next time, I'll just go with Buckeyes...

I had a sleeve of graham crackers that were embarrassingly old.  So I found this recipe and figured I could salvage the crackers.  Since I only had one sleeve (9 crackers), I halved the recipe, reduced the sugar by more than half, and followed the rest of the instructions.  I did take a reviewer's idea, making it the "fudge" way.  Oh wow, it was so good!!  I wish I was not forced to half this!!  Next time, I make it, I will keep the original portions but half the sugar.

A wonderful treat!  I was a bit terrified by how it looked, but appearances are deceiving with this one.  The whole family loved it.

Despite the fact that I forgot to add the peanut butter before adding the graham crackers, this still came out great!  (I went ahead and stirred it in.)  I love standard no-bakes made with oats, but the grahams give this a whole new twist.

These did not set up for me. I don't think 30 seconds after it reaches the boil stage is enough cooking time. There was no way I could drop this by spoonfuls, so I had to line an 8X8 pan with wax paper as suggested by reviewers. Still, they could barely be cut, and they are thick and sticky. The taste was not all that appealing to me either. Also, the directions mention nuts, but nuts aren't mentioned in the ingredients.

These were very good.  I left the cocoa out but otherwise made it as written.  Please change the serving sizes.  I like small cookies and don't make mine large, but I got NINE out of this, not 24.  This recipe is misleading.
