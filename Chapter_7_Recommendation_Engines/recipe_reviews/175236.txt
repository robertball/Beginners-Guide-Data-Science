I love these potatoes. I'll be honest though, I didn't use this recipe, but I did throw together almost the exact same thing last night. It was so good I wanted to post it...but I didn't need to, thanks Valerie! The only difference with mine was, I used minced garlic (jarred, fridge kind) and a little less cream cheese. I also added a little milk, just because I didn't want them too thick (although using Val's amount of cream cheese would have done a better job). Thanks again Valerie!

Tastes like a warm (but mashed) potato salad. Has great taste, even though I used Fat Free cream cheese. Will definitely make again. I made as a side dish for baked crispy chicken and fresh steamed green beans. Went excellent together. Thanks Valerie, for a yummy alternative to mashed potatoes!

Very good!  Green onions add lots of flavor.  I did end up adding just a little milk to it.

I upped the butter to just over 1/2 a stick but otherwise left it as-is and this was delicious. Everyone raved over the potatoes at our Thanksgiving table. I didn't have the heart to tell everyone they were LOADED with cream cheese and butter! I'll never tell my secret...

Fan-freakin'-tasic!  Of course, if 2 tbsp of butter is good, then 8 is better!  Yes, I use a whole stick, and it's WORTH it!

Just wanted to say I know several people have wanted to thin them, which is fine, but I never have.  Yes, they are way thicker than normal mashed potatoes, but they are supposed to be thick and lumpy.  That's why you just stir in the cream cheese and butter with a fork instead of a masher, to gently break up the potato but leave it somewhat chunky.  To each his own...the cream cheese makes it regardless of the thickness

These are delicious!  I used regular sized red potatoes (about 7-8) since they are less expensive than the petite and cut them into eight pieces.  I served them at our family Christmas dinner and again at a pot luck with teenagers and both times they were a hit.

Good. I did use garlic powder and sea salt. That was the only change I made. I think these would have been better had I sauteed the onions in the butter, then added them to the potatoes. I'll do that next time.

It was really good but nothing spectacular. I had to add milk to make it less dry. Will probably use again.

I prepared these per recipe and found, like other reviewers have noted, they needed thinning.  I had cream on hand, so I added some until I had the consistency I wanted.  Superb.  But potatoes, cream cheese and cream?  Most of the mathematicians in NASA can't calculate those calories.  Oh, well...Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we diet. Thanks, Valerie.

These potatoes are so delish I had to post a response right after leaving the dinner table! I used reg potatoes instead of red though. My kids loved them & asked to have them more often & my husband ate more of them then anything else! Perfect for the busy mom to escape the boring same mash potatoes! Thanks Valerie:o)

Very quick and oh so creamy!! Well atleast I thought (but I did top these with a cabbage sausage mixture). I left out the green onions since I had onion in what I was serving with these.

Good and easy. I used regular potatoes peeled and threw in a handful of shredded cheddar cheese with the onion. Great with meatloaf. Thanks!

Didn't have garlic salt or onion....  I used fresh chopped garlic and sea salt and didn't have any onion but used everything else accordingly.  This is a great recipe, simplest mashed potatoes recipe I've found (besides the boxed stuff).  I gave it 4 stars because flavor wise it's not the absolute best but I think it would require a lot more work (more prep and planning ahead)to make it a 5.

Very good and definitely do not use a mixer - more character this way.  Do agree with the reviewer that uses extra butter - for us only a few more tablespoons but depends on your taste.

I used 8 tablespoons of butter (a whole stick) and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I also added 1/2 cup of milk. Prior to adding the extra butter and milk, the potatoes were very dry.

I have made these twice now. The first time I followed the receipe exactly.  It was just okay for me. I didn't really care for the green onion taste. The second time I made it I omitted the green onions. While it was better,  it tasted like it had way too much cream cheese. I doubt I'll make these again.

This recipe was awesome!!! Absolutely loved it! The only thing I didn't add to the mixture was the chopped onions and I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt but it still turned out great!! I will be making this again very soon!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!! :-)

I think I liked these better than my husband -- but with the ingredients list, what's not to like.  Had to add some milk to thin them down a bit as they were pretty stiff.  Flavor was excellent.

Great recipe!...Followed recipe exactly, except I used light cream cheese and whipped in the kitchenaid blender. The potatoes were creamy and just the right consistency!

Amazingly good! I recommend adding just a pinch of milk to get it a little smoother, but we tried it as written and it was great!

I made this yummy recipe for my grand daughter's 1st Communion dinner to accompany grilled London Broil.  I made it the night before, increasing the amount to serve 24, and kept it in a slow cooker on "keep warm" until ready to serve.  Everyone, young and old, absolutely raved about it!  I will definitely keep this as a "go-to" recipe.  So-o-o easy and luscious.
