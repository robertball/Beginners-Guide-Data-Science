this was very tasty and had an authentic mediterranean taste to it. I thought the sauce needed a little pep though and added tabasco and some cayenne pepper. I used canned tomatoes which worked fine. we'll definitely make this again :)

I made this for dinner tonight, as a side dish with steak, and we found it very tasty.  It might have been even better if I had remembered to add the oregano, but truthfully I didn't miss it.  I only realized that it was missing when I came to do this review. I used Portabello mushrooms and since I was out of olive oil I used a bit of saflower oil and a bit of butter for the sauce. Thank you Mary for a lovely dish. Next time I will make sure I have all the right ingredients on hand and that I add them all. LOL..

This recipe was awesome.  My whole family loved it.  I added in the black olives with the garlic and mushrooms to saute.  I also didn't blanch the tomatoes, and they turned out great.  I just chopped them up and added them to the saute pan for the last few minutes.  Then sprinked with feta when done.  Yummy!!   Will make again.

Overall it was good, although I do not know of one Greek person who would use canned black olives. Only Kalamata olives would do, as well as a tablespoon (at least) of Greek oregano.

I did not care for this.  Without taste - needed a little more seasoning.  It honestly just didn't work - it was a very water-downed version of a classic Greek dish.  Not recommended if you are a fan of Greek food.  Possibly good for young kids???

I looked foward to making this as it contains several of my favorite ingredients.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the total lack of flavor in this dish.  There is definitely something lacking in this recipie and I will not make this again.

Excellent!  Even with exceptions - canned tomatoes, no mushrooms, and used fettucini.  Very fast prep. Very good!

Since my husband doesn't like mushrooms, I followed the advice of others and used artichokes and zucchini.  We thought it was just ok -- not bad, but maybe if we would have used half of the amount of pasta called for it might have been a bit better.

I feel the olives and feta are optional.  (If someone in the family doesn't like them, the recipe is still very do-able.)

The tomatoes don't really have to be blanched.  Next time I'll just cut them up.

This also works with Basil instead of Oregano.

For a variation, add marinated artichoke hearts.

The whole family loved this.  I used less oil--maybe 2 tbs and left out the mushrooms because I'm the only one in my family who will eat them (go figure...).

very good.  I added the olives, marinated artichokes and feta after I covered the pasta with sauce.  Probably could use some italian seasoning, garlic salt.

Made this for a Greek Easter meal and it turned out great! I would allow extra time than stated but otherwise great! Was a hit with the crowd. We used the feta and olives as an optional topping. I would make it again too for regular dinners. :) Fun to make too.

I thought that this was a pretty good recipe. The one inprovement I made was just to use fresh oregano instead of dried oregano. In my opinion adding fresh ingredients instead of dried ingredients adds so much more flavor. If you like flavorful food, i would use fresh oregano not dried oregano. Overall this was a tasty recipe!

This was pretty good. Definitely needed the feta cheese. I also don't think it was entirely necessary to blanch the tomatoes.

I was amazed at the ease of the recipe and how much my kids really liked this dish. However, in the future I will omit the FETA cheese, it doesn't need it, unless you really like it (I too think it should be optional)

Pretty simple. There are lots of ways to spice up and add to this dish... And it can go either way - Italian or Greek. Sub the feta cheese for parmesan and it's not greek anymore IMO.

We slightly edited this recipe by adding more olives and shrimp for the seafood lovers.  We didn't blanch the tomatoes which made it a much easier and faster recipe.  This is great for parents with picky eaters, as everyone cleaned their plates.

It turned out good but I added some parsley, used stewed tomatoes, and added marinated chicken to bring up the flavor a bit.

I liked this one.  I added some primavera sauce and red onions to it and it was wonderful.  Next time I think I am going to try it the way it is supposed to be done next time.  I made this as a bed for the 'Feta Chicken'.  Really good combo!

I made this recipe exactly as the directions said and my husband and I LOVED IT! 
We will definitely be making this more often than spaghetti, as it's much better than spaghetti could ever be! My husband hates black olives too, but in this dish he said they go perfect with the fresh tomato sauce and feta! He's right!

This pasta was amazing! Everyone loved it, including my 2 year old. I omitted the black olives, and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and it was still great. I also added some onion salt to season. Overall, fast and yummy. I will make again and again.

GREAT RECIPE! Me and my roommate made it one night and it as awesome...easy prep quick to cook and went very nicely with some garlic bread...the only thing we changed was that we added a 1/4 c white wine when cooking the mushroom and it was fantastic, the mushroom soaked it all up and gave the dish a slightly sweet note which complimented the acidity of the tomatoes the bitterness of the olives and the saltiness of the feta. Next time we'll try adding other vegetables as suggested.
