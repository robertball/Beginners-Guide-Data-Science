Our first words were, "It's interesting" and "It's flavorful". Won't make again but if you love basil, you'll like this.

I really liked these! I do have to say, they are heavy on the basil, so if you're going to eat them on their own without the bun you might want to cut back on the basil because I felt it was too overpowering.  But with a bun and all the other toppings (cheddar, lettuce, tomato), the flavors balanced each other out and it made for a great burger!  I loved the addition of the Parmesan.

These were good! I liked the addition of Parmesan. Only thing I did differently was add a bit of bread crumbs, I wanted to grill them on the bbq and they seemed to hold together better for the grill.
