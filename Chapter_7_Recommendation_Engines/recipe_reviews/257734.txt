This is a standard recipe for clotted cream which I have made many times.  I have used ultra-pasteurized cream (by mistake) and it works just fine. The lactose caramelizes delectably overnight. You can leave it longer in the oven if you keep the temperature at 175 - the longer it cooks, the more the cream fat will solidify. If you only save the solids, it will be very firm. I normally leave some of the liquid and mash it together slightly. YUM!

Ambrosial. This was SO great. I made it for Mother's Day and served it with scones and blackcurrant jam. When I pulled it out of the fridge a day later, it was solid, like butter, so be sure to bring it up to room temp for easier spreading.

I had never tried clotted cream before, but had to prepare a menu around the book, Anna and the King of Siam, for a library fund raiser. My savory was a Thai dish, and my sweet was fresh scones, with clotted cream and jam. What a pleasant surprise! You have to admit the name is not appetizing, but the result is absolutely delicious!! What a simple recipe. The 12 hour cooking time is perfect, and the cream will appear a bit runny while cooling. After the overnight in the fridge, the cream is spreadable with a buttery crunchy top, exactly as presented in the video. Chef John is right, you will want to leave the crunchy part on the top, as it is the "prize" as long as it lasts!!

Incredible! This is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The leftover liquid was perfect for using in the scones I served it on. My oven does not have a setting below 200, but the results were excellent, and for what it's worth I left it in there for about 11 hours, but 12 probably would've been fine, so no worries if you have an older oven like I do.

Oh, my!  Hadn’t had clotted cream since a trip to England in the 1970s.  My husband has often commented that he would love to try Mrs. McCarthy’s prize-winning strawberry scones often talked about in the PBS Father Brown series. I made buttermilk scones with strawberries (Joy of Cooking recipe with dried strawberries from Aldi), strawberry jam, and this wonderful clotted cream.  Chef John never disappoints!!!

My kids and I really liked this. We’ve never had clotted cream before. This reminds me of a mix between creamy butter and rich condensed milk. I made it for a girls’ tea party and I think the little pieces of crust were off-putting to my younger guests.

I used heavy whipping cream and made sure the only ingredient is "cream." A tip. Make sure that all the butterfat is out of the container. Shake it a little or scrape out the inside. Make sure any solids are in the liquid and mixed up well.

Most difficult thing about making this is finding the non-ultra pasteurized cream. I have heard that some ovens don't have a temperature setting low enough.

I have to admit I had my doubts about this recipe, baking it in the oven as well. I followed this recipe to a 'T' and both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how great it tasted. John you have another winner.

I love this with scones.   It's very rich, I couldn't eat nearly as much as I imagined I would so I gave some to a few coworkers and everyone loved it.   I wish that I'd had enough time to make the scones that Chef John suggests using the excess liquid for.

After trying clotted cream for the first time, I wanted to be able to make it. This recipe was easier than I had expected, and made enough to last a little while.

I've made this twice and had great results each time. The first time I used local heavy cream and it came out just like the video. The second time I had to use an organic heavy cream that might have been ultra pasteurized. It came out a little more liquidy even after I drained off the whey. But I whipped it for a few minutes and then it had a lovely texture.

My British hubby loved this.  Really easy to make-just have to wait it out.  I liked it a lot too but I think I like Devonshire Cream just a little more.  It's got a bit of sweetness to it and it's creamier.

This is an incredible recipe. It is easy to make; albeit time consuming. The cream stays stable for a really long time provided it is kept refrigerated.

Followed the instructions to a "T", including the type of cream to purchase. It smelled delicious out of the oven and absolutely tastes delicious. I put the final clotted cream product into a glass mason jar with a canning jar lid on it. Then I made several other dishes to use up the cream that was poured out (the part that doesn't get baked) and so nothing was wasted at all. I will definitely be making this again. I'm now going to try out Chef John's scone recipe : )

I've never tasted clotted cream but this tasted pretty good. I dunno if I'd say it's nutty, but kind of like a thicker tastier butter
