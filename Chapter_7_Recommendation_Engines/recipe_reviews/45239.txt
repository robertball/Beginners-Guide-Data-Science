This reminds me of a dish that my mother used to make only she used fresh green beans from the garden and also added cooked cubed potatoes. When I make it now I play around with the consistency sometimes making it thicker or thinner. My sisters and I try to make it as good as mom did but fall short but still yummy!

This is not soup!!!! The broth in most soups is not pure bacon fat! If you drain the broth (pure grease)you have green beans and bacon period!!!!!!

I don't even LIKE green beans but I found this soup to be outstanding. Everytime I've prepared it I get complimented. Easy to prepare and very tasty.

Yes Jason my German/Austrian grandparents were all about flavor too; that's why they all died from "bad diet" related illnesses. However they ate like this ALL THE TIME and I'm all about the occasional indulgence and this soup is one that everyone should enjoy at least once in awhile. I used chicken broth in lieu of the water. This is one EXCELLENT soup and I thank you for submitting it!

Very Good but it is called heart-stopin because of the greese. Great on the taste buds but not heart healthy. Now after saying that I will still make it again.

This was a quick and easy side dish. People shouldn't be mean. Hey if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all.

We add tons of vinegar and potatoes. Super delicious and very traditional!
