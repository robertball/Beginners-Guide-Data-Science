This is the best barbecue sauce. We used with home made pulled pork sandwiches. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is great.  A few years ago I was desperate for a BBQ sauce, and came up with almost this identical recipe...

I made this sauce..at first it looked a little strange but then after really whipping it up over the stove it started to look like sauce. I had to add honey, more garlic, lemon juice and cayenne pepper to give it more "taste"...was a little bland at first...but it came out wonderful..will make again!

I made bar-b-que pork sandwiches for my bridge club luncheon.  I had left-over pork tenderloin, but did not like the bottled sauce I bought.  I made this sauce instead and it was delicious!  It was so good, in fact, we were using the rolls to sop up the sauce that fell on our plates.  Thanks for a great recipe.
