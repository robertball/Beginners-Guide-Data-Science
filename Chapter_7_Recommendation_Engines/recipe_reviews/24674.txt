Made this for Opa B-day, huge hit. Instead of the caraway seeds used nutmeg (what germans use in almost everything, for them is like pepper for us) and yellow onion, can´t beat that flavor.  I cook the bacon, discard almost all the fat from the pan and sautee onions in there.

Excellent. I would only change a couple of minor details. Cut the recipe down to at 1/3 or 1/2 the size. The entire recipie filled 3 standard frozen pie crusts for me. You can use frozen pie crusts, but use a very shallow pie pan (similar to a creme brulee dish). It tastes better in a shallow dish with more crust rather than a deep dish quiche style crust. The taste was perfect.

this is very close to the Zwiebelkuchen my grandma used to make
an easy yeast dough would be more authentic 
in germany you can buy this in every bakery where it is served with very young wine
(wich is sparkly and sweet)
it is a seasonal dish
so when you serve this...
add a light sweet wine and a cheese platter with some rustic bread

Very rich, but very good.  I did add a little garlic and pepper and was thinking that next time I make it, a little parmesan cheese would probably be good.

We do family dinner once a month with a different theme...  my grandma chose German and so I made this.  I left out the bacon as I'm a vegetarian and it turned out really good.  She especially loved it.  Thanks!

This was very good. It's pretty rich and kind of like quiche but not so egg-y. The recipe makes ton.  I halved it and we still had leftovers twice. I don't think the bacon added much flavor. When I make it again, I think I'll double the bacon. If you're an onion lover, this is definitely worth a try.

Absolutely, positively NOTHING wrong with this recipe. It's just a matter of taste and although both my parents were born and raised in Germany/Austria this was just a bit too sweet for us. Yes, that's what happens when onions are cooked, but I guess we just enjoy our onions in the raw. No complaints whatsoever, however, no WOW's either.

I used a 9x13 baking dish to make this.  It turned out great.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to double the bacon and use about 5 lbs of vidalia onions.

This was amazing!  The changes I made were minor in that it was only going to be me eating it.  So I used less onions 5 large videlia(sp?) onions, 1/2 lb bacon, 1/2 sour cream and put it in a deep dish pie (with piecrust).  I didn't have any caraway seeds, but it was outstanding w/o it.  I did add a dash of cardamon and nutmeg.  Amazing dish will make again!

Nice, rich and wonderful. If you are new to German food, this is almost like a onion quiche. If you leave off the caraway seeds it will still taste good. This recipe make enough for 3-4 pies, especially if you use a shallow pie crust.

Made this for our Oktoberfest.  Everyone loved it except my husband.  He's a picky eater anyway.  I thought it was great & had several people ask for the recipe.  I will make it again, but it does make a big pan & you don't want a big serving of it.

This was excellent!! I made this for our neighbor's Oktoberfest. I also cut the recipe down to serve 8 and prepared it in a rectangular casserole dish, it was more than plenty.  BTW: be sure NOT to put our onion skins in the garbage disposal :)

It's delicious. My husband loves it. If you don't have bacon, you can also use Prosciutto ham. There are a couple of stores selling it already diced.

We had Zwiebelkuchen in Germany which was prepared on cookie sheets rather than pie plates.  Taking that into consideration when I tried this recipe I calculated it to 6 serving size and rolled the pie crust to fit a 14" pizza pan. This reduced the bake time to 45 minutes.  I also omitted the caraway and sprinkled the top slightly with nutmeg and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  I will also try this recipe with a pizza crust base rather than a pie crust base just for comparison.  It was easy to prepare considering I did not lattice the top of the pie as shown in the photo. It was exceptionally good.

Just a comment on Jim Whitford's description of when/where this pie is enjoyed.  The correct name for the "Stube" where you will find these is a "BesenWirtschaft".  This translates to a Broom Economy.  The Stubes will hang a broom outside the door where this is served (along with the new wine).  These only last for a few weeks and they they (by German Law) must close until the next year.  And these delightful Zwiebelkuchens no matter which BesenWirtschaft you visit.

I was not really impressed.  I did cut this in half because it's just my husband and I and I could tell it would make way too much.  This reminded us of a quiche which we both really like, but this just was missing something.  I'm glad we tried it, but we won't be making it again.

i changed the recipe a bit, made it more of a pizza style and halved the measurements of everything, i think it might taste a bit heartier if you use pre-made crescent roll dough or other biscuit dough as the crust instead of pastry dough, i also melted some cheese on top with 5 minutes left of baking, delicious!  the pizza-style zwiebelkuchen bakes in half the time and would be quite nice to take to a potluck dinner!

Just made a whole German Cuisine meal for my parents 45th wedding anniversary and this was everyone's favorite dish!  It turned out great and everyone raved! My brother suggested adding shredded hash browns and I might do that next time and make it more of a breakfast dish! VERY YUMMY!

Thanks for the nutmeg suggestions Lucy7.  I'll try that.  Though I'm German thru & thru (mostly), I just don't really like caraway seeds.  And I didn't realize Germans used nutmeg as one would pepper.  Love to learn new things!

When I first read this recipe I read "4 lbs bacon". I thought it seemed pretty high, but whatever. I proceeded to cook the first pound...while it was cooking I checked the recipe...OOPS, only need 4 SLICES. *blush* I added 8 slices and saved the rest for sandwiches the next day. My children (6 and 4) just love onions so this was huge hit with them, the whole house actually! I won't make this too often, but when I do I'm sure it will be devoured.

This is a great basic recipe but I did make a few changes.  First, I made a yeast dough because it's more traditional.  Also, I used a 10" spring form pan and cut the recipe in half.  Also, more than 1/2 tsp. of salt is needed.

I thought I reviewed this a couple of yrs. ago but couldn't find it. 

I didn't use bacon. I cooked some sausage, then cooked the onion with grated apple and mixed it all together before adding to the pie shell. 

Wonderful fall recipe

My effort was a flop.  The biggest problem was the excessive amount of onions in the recipe.  Much less would have been much more.

Spent 2 weeks in Germany and ordered zwiebelkuchen many times. This recipe is better than any eaten in Germany. I doubled the bacon. Served it at a German dinner party with 20 guests as an hors d'oeuvre. Great also as a first course. It was the favorite dish at the party. Will definitely prepare it again.

This is the recipe our German neighbors make every fall for their "first wine" party. Due to illness they couldn't do it this year, so I did. As usual it was a huge success. I served wurst,salad and wine. Apple tart for dessert. All was a big hit.

I made this for Christmas Eve and my German boyfriend loved it - several other people asked for the recipe.  If I made it again I would probably just make 1/2 as it makes a very large pan.

This recipe has all the ingredients to amaze, however the process is completely hosed.  First of all, cook the bacon first and remove.  Then, cook the onions in the bacon fat.  Season to taste (remembering you will be adding unseasoned sour cream and two eggs also) with s&p, add 1 tsp nutmeg.  Next, once the onions are cooked as noted, add twice the amount of flour as the recipe calls for to the onions.  Add chopped crisp bacon to onion mix, cool to near room temp.  Add sour cream, combine well.  Add eggs and again combine well.  This will make a world of difference...as will lowering oven temp after 20 minutes to 375 for another possible 30.  Clean knife and done crust are key, not time....

I will admit I was more than a bit skeptical due to the amount of onions but it tasted so much better than I could have ever imagined. I did half the recipe for one pie pan and doubled the amount of bacon.

This is the second time I've made this. I halved the recipe each time. The changes were a little more salt, uncured bacon, more caraway seeds, white onions. I also cooked the bacon first and took out most of the fat and sauteed the onions in about  1 1/2 T of the bacon drippings. I served the pie with bratwurst with a grainy mustard and  Affentaler Winzer, Valley of the Monkey, Spätburgunder Pinot Noir.  The wine was recommended and so was the zwiebelkuchen.  The wine was really good with the meal. The zwiebelkuchen is easy to make and it will something I'll make often.

I've made this several times but have always used hash browns for the crust rather than a pastry. Everyone raves about it and asks for seconds!

Thank you for the great recipe.  Just a little correction on the intro from a southern born German. The farmers restaurants are called Besenwirtschaft.  My favorite places to eat when we are back in fall.

I'm about to make this - sounds so good.  Suggestion, you won't need to add extra flour to thicken if you cook down the onions, it takes more time but to me the caramelized onions are the only answer! ( Also you are far less likely to have any explosive effects later  if any at all !- LOL )

Supremely delicious!!! I loved this recipe; savory and satisfying with a wonderful flavor blend.  I caramelized my onions and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  I only used 2 pounds of onions, which was plenty for my taste.

Excellent recipe, just like Oma's.  My (German) family actually adds the caraway right into the mixture as opposed to on top.  My mom likes to omit the bacon, and truth be told I almost prefer it that way!

Yum! So happy I tried this recipe. It surprised me how much I liked it!!
"Cheated" with pre-made pie crust. Modified to use about 3# onions and half of other ingredients. And I spent the time to make the lattice topping...Beautiful. 
Cooked in less time- I think it was done in about 40 minutes. Definite repeat!
Great with soup. Served it with veggie-cabbage soup. Leftovers were great, too.

This was very close to the way I remember it tasting when I lived in Germany 40 years ago. Thank you!
I adapted the recipe for my vegan diet, omitting the bacon and substituting mashed tofu for the sour cream. I found one large onion was sufficient for two small pies.
Excellent recipe!

Really liked this though it seemed a little bland / in need of more salt to me.  (I notice, however, that no other reviewers thought so...hmmmm.)  I halved the recipe and did not make a lattice crust but the top browned nicely, as did the Pillsbury All-Ready pie crust I used in my shallow ceramic tart pan. My out-of-state mom is of German descent (me too, of course, though more Italian than German); wish she lived nearby so I could make this for her.  I like to make a few German dishes every year in October, even without having an Oktoberfest; this one will be repeated.  Thanks, Bill, for sharing.

It was OK tasting, you cant eat much of it though because its so rich. I used Vadalia onions though and it might have been too sweet. if i make it again im cutting down on the sour cream, maybe subing some of the onion for potatos, and i might add some immitation crab meat for more flavor

I made this last year for Oktoberfest and it will be returning for this year.  It is wonderful.  The flavors mesh well together and it slices up very nice.
