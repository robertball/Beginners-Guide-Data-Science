Very tasty sauce, but I'm going to try grilling the chicken next time - didn't really like the way it worked under the broiler...  also, double the sauce would be good too.

This sauce is the BEST!  We added fresh cilantro (and extra Tequila!).  Grill instead of broil, then pour sauce on.  Great on steak or fish filets, too.

I made this recipe while on vacation in Florida. It was my first big meal ever :) I was surprised at how simple it was yet how elegant it turned out! The kitchen I was using in the rental didn't have baking sheets or broiler pans, so I used a frying pan stove top instead. I also omitted the tortillas and garnish and served it as just a main chicken entree. It worked great! I paired my meal with homemade Mexican rice, mango/black bean salsa, and beer margaritas. My boyfriend proposed to me the next day, so it must have turned out :D  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This recipe was awesome! I doubled the sauce (also had extra chicken). My husband liked it better without the tortilla. Next time I might also cut up green/red peppers & onions, cook them on the grill then add the sauce to that too!

Very nice flavor, however the meat was a little tough.  Next time, will try to cut some slits on the breast so it cooks faster.

This chicken dish was delicious!!  I found it very easy to prepare, a quick dish to fix on a weeknight.  Anything that takes 30min or less and tastes this good is wonderful!  I added some spanish rice as a side dish!

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't change the ingredients but I made it into a marinade by doubling the ingredients and let the chicken soak for about 4 hours.   My hubby grilled it and he said "wow, this tastes great".  We'll make again and again this summer.

This recipe is good. It does taste a lot like a frozen margarita.  The sauce if very easy to make.  I didn't have any limes, so I used bottled lime juice.  I also grilled the chicken and then basted with the sauce the last ten minutes of cooking.  I will probably make this again simply because it was so simple.

This was okay but a bit bland for us. Maybe some of that can be attributed to the fact that I baked the chicken rather than broiled, but I don't think that would have made too much of a difference. And I did season it first. But the sauce was alright, if a tad sour. We ate it, but I probably won't make again.

i think this dish was just not our taste.  i grilled instead of broiled as many reviewers suggested, but found the lime-y flavor to be kind of unpleasant.  perhaps it was too sweet for me, i'm not sure.  the kids just kind of picked at it, and although i finished mine, i'm not excited that i have three leftover breasts in the fridge.  i think i will keep my margaritas in a glass from now on :)

I used the juice of 3 limes, and 2 cloves of garlic with no cornstarch! It was DELICIOUS as a marinade for chicken on the grill. Big hit.

These was pretty good.  Only made a few  changes...we added shredded white cheddar and monterey jack cheese.  Also, instead of tequila we added some of Jose Cuervo's golden margarita.

This was wonderful!  Great flavor!  I marinated the the chicken all day in the tequila, honey and lime juice.  I also grilled it, served it with the sauce and but without the tortillas.

I give this 4.5 stars.  I LOVE IT.  I made the sauce exactly as written, however, I grilled the chicken (seasoned with garlic/onion powder, s & p).  Served with avacado & lime slices.  Awesome!
Thanks Rayna!!!

These had a great flavor. I followed Zipp's advice and seasoned one half with black pepper and the other with red pepper and then threw them on the grill. I started basting the chicken four or five minutes after putting them on the grill. The sauce carmelized on the chicken making the chicken nice and juicy when it was done. Served it with warm tortillas, salsa and avocado. Great, easy, quick dish.

I doubled the recipe and spooned a little bit of the sauce on the chicken as it first went in and then added more sauce every 10 minutes or so. Wonderful flavor, served it with Cilantro Lime Rice and mango avocado salsa and it was just perfect!

Delicious marinade recipe.  Four stars this way, five stars mine.  I took the advice of several commenters and doubled the recipe, except for the lime.  (I also omitted the cornstarch and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.)  I didn't have fresh so used lime juice instead and used about four or five tbs.  I started by rubbing bone-in chicken breasts(2) with vegetable oil, then liberally sprinkling each with Greek seasoning.  I grilled instead of broiled and after browning on each side started basting with the marinade.  After slow grilling for about 45 minutes, they were absolutely delicious! Served with white lime rice, corn, fresh avocado and a salad.

I thought the sauce was ok, but the hubs said it had too much honey.  I didn't broil the chicken, but pounded thin and sautéed in a bit of oil so that it didn't dry out.  This was super fast/easy to make, but the taste was just average.

Besides using tenders instead of breasts, I don't alter this recipe at all, which is rare.  Love the chicken sliced and used in tacos.  I do grill the chicken instead of broil.  Makes a nice "fresh" meal on a summer day.

Very tangy and flavorful!  My husband and kids all enjoyed it.  I liked it so much I made it again several days later for company.  Very easy, too.

I'm not sure if I was me or the recipe, but I was not very impressed with this dish.  I even squeezed the limes myself, but the sauce tasted funny to me for some reason.  My boyfriend liked it so I may make it again and try adding things (like more honey).

I did make some changes to this recipe. I just felt it lacked some ingredients. 

First off, I doubled the ingredients for the sauce. 
After heating the sauce I set it aside.  

Next I fried a couple of strips of bacon in another frying pan. After removing the bacon I sautéed an onion, a red bell pepper,  a green bell pepper and cilantro  in the drippings.

Also I grilled the chicken along with wood  chips to give it a smokey flavor. With five minutes remaining on the cook time I removed the chicken from the grill. I placed a sheet of foil on the grill then put the chicken back on top of the foil. I then basted with some of the sauce.

I then added all of the sautéed ingredients along with some fresh diced tomatoes to the remaining sauce and stirred until hot. I did add a small amountof water to thin the sauce. 

Next step was to remove the chicken and top with the sauce. Add the diced avocado and serve with Spanish rice and seasoned pinto beans. (I dislike black beans)

This dish was sooo good!! I will definitely make this again!!

WE really liked this recipe.  I did add some cilantro to the marinade and grilled instead of broiled it. I boiled the marinade and reduced it by half and drizzled it on the chicken. I also added some chunks of onion and red & green bell peppers to the marinade and grilled them also. I've already make this twice and will be making it again tonight!

I doubled the sauce recipe and it was so tart we could barely eat it. I also used leg & thigh meat, which was a whole lot of work for not much difference. So I'd skip that. I loved the combination though and will try it again and not double the lime juice.

Read reviews and other colorful pictures available...the one featured is bland!  Reviewers suggested doubling the sauce, grilling the meat, and eliminating the tortilla.

Yes, I would try it again. Very tasty. Tried to broil in toaster oven. Tough. Not sure if it was the Walmart chicken. Served it with baked potato and veggies and double the sauce.

My family loved it! Next time I'll add a little less honey and a little more lime and tequila. I doubted the sauce recipe this time just because we are "sauce people" - and we grilled the chicken like others had suggested (I'm not super broiler comfy!). It was excellent!! Severed it with a cilantro lime rice - yummmm

This was so good, and super easy to make on a weeknight! I actually ended up cutting up the chicken after broiling it, and poured the remaining sauce over it to make a taco filling. Then I served it in the shell with black beans, rice, red onion, tomato, and avocado. It was delicious!

I was really pleased with this recipe! I followed it exactly for the chicken and sauce. I'm not really used to broiling, so I didn't realize that you should put the chicken on the top shelf very close to the heat. But once I realized my mistake, I moved it and the chicken had a nice charred look to it. I think broiling it tastes just as good as grilled and was super easy. I didn't serve the chicken on the tortilla, but instead served it over Spanish rice and black beans. Then I added tortilla strips to make it a bit crunchy (like they do in "that restaurant") and cut up the tomatoes and avocado with some lime juice as a topping. I also took another reviewer's advice and cut slits in the chicken prior to cooking, the marinade seeps in and makes it extra yummy. It was fantastic! My husband loved it. Adding it to the rotation for sure. Next time I may pound the chicken to make it a bit thinner and experiment with different salsa toppings. Thanks for a great summer recipe!

I made the sauce as directed, but cooked the chicken in a skillet and added the sauce to the second half for the cooking time.  We really were looking forward to this recipe.  It sounded so good, but unfortunately it just didn't suit our taste.  We found the sauce to be very bitter and it's just not something I would make again.

I read all the reviews about the chicken being tough and since I didn't have access to a grill at the time, I cut the chicken into strips and sautéed in the sauce.  (I doubled the sauce as well and highly recommend that as well.)  Instead of just tomato and avocado slices, I made fresh guacamole and put that on top.  With those few changes I give it 4 stars, next time I will add some green chilies (or even some fresh chopped jalapenos if I'm feeling adventurous) into the chicken mixture and I think that would take up to a 5.

The sauce is delicious! I would suggest serving it over plain rice though...no need for a tortilla. I grilled the chicken then just put the sauce over at the end. Liked it with the avacado and tomato on the side. Nice enough to serve to company!

I added cilantro and left the cornstarch out of the sauce and instead used it as a marinade for 2 hrs, then grilled the chicken. Then I tried to make the sauce as directed for a topping, but not sure what happened because it seized and was unusable. Probably not the recipe's fault though. I served the grilled chicken with some cumin and cilantro spiced ranch and shredded cheese, placed under the broiler for a few minutes. It was great!

I made this last weekend for a crowd... 8 chicken breasts, tripled the sauce, marinated them in it overnight (midnight to 6pm grill time the next day) then basted with it the last few minutes on the grill.  Topped with lime zest, and it was AMAZING.  Oh, I added 4 TB of triple sec (to the tripled sauce amount) and it was great!

This turned out pretty well and my kids really liked it.  The sauce was a bit tart but once it was drizzled on it complimented the chicken nicely.  I chose to grill my chicken on the bbq and then just sliced it up and drizzled most of the sauce over.  Tasty, healthy, quick dish.

We liked this recipe a lot...relatively healthy and allows me the opportunity to eat avocado (which I love by my DH is indifferent to).  The only thing I didn't really like about this recipe is the broiling aspect of it (set my smoke alarm off), so next time I will probably grill the chicken.  Thanks for a great/easy recipe.

I used the sauce as a marinade and marinated the chicken for a couple hours before grilling, which worked out just fine.

This was even more delicious than I anticipated, and I'm glad I served it to company.  I used 1800 Silver tequila, and I imagine better quality tequilas make better tasting dishes.  My only change was to use 1/2 tsp. minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  I'll be making this again, and trying it on fish, too.

This was quite tasty.  I skipped the tortillas and just served as whole chicken breasts that I grilled on the bbq.  I think next time I will use some of the sauce to marinade the chicken first and see if it will soak up even more of the flavor.

So GREAT, I changed nothing, although next time I may increase the amount of chicken, it didn't seem to be enough!

I wasn't too crazy about this.  I love anything lime and margaritas too, so I expected to love it.  I was at least willing to eat the leftovers, though.  I added fresh cilantro and a little bit of taco sauce with my second meal, and I liked that better.  I probably won't make it again, though.

I wish I could give this 6 stars.  It was amazing.  I grilled the chiken and then basted it with the sauce.  Wow.  I can't say enough about how great this was.  The chicken was perfectly tender.  I almost wanted to skip the fixin's and just eat the meat.  My husband has asked that I add this to the rotation.  I will!

pretty good recipe. I didn't necessarily think it tasted like a margarita but it was a nice flavor sauce for chicken. I cut the chicken into strips and stir-fried with about half of the sauce. Then served the chicken strips in the tortilla with the tomato wedges, avocado and I also added sliced white onion to make a soft taco and drizzled the remaining sauce over the top.

We loved this recipe.  With 3 small mouths in the house I cut the chicken up.  You also get more sauce that way.  It is a regular meal in our home.  Good in the tortilla bowls too.

This recipe was really good. It's definately a keeper. I might have used a bit too much lime, but none the less, loved it.

My husband and I loved this, but the kids wouldn't eat it.
