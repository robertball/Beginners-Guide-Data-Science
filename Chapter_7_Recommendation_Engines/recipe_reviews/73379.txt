I'm giving it a five but I did make some changes. I added some dijon mustard and light soy sauce to the tomatoes and onions. I put the TVP in a small glass casserole dish and then spooned over the tomato mixture and sort of pressed it into the cracks between the pieces. Then I put just over a cup of shredded marble cheese over top and baked it for 15 minutes at 350, then on broil for a couple minutes to finish it off. I really enjoyed this meal, but my boyfriend hated it. I think he's just scared of it!

This is the kind of recipe that wasn't bad enough to throw away but wasn't good enough to make again.  It was a little heavy on the TVP for me, I would recommend using an extra tomato and maybe even a little tomato sauce.  Also, maybe some more cheese?

I thought this was nice. I had some TVP and wanted to use it up, so I made these. Made them into burgers by adding some egg whites and a few bread crumbs

Great recipe - I didn't have the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so that probably would have made it taste better, but it was still really good for such a healthy dish.  I also used 1/3 less fat mexican blend cheese.  I used it for stuffed peppers, but ended up liking it better just by itself.  Great healthy recipe; I will definitely make it again.

Really pleased to see a recipe for TVP. I haven't made this, but wanted to share the following: reconstituting the TVP with a seasoned liquid makes for a more flavorful dish. For example: tomato or enchilada sauce; bouillon or broth.  For chili, I make the chili first, then ladle off some liquid to reconstitute the TVP, then add back to the chili.
