My whole family loves this recipe!  The only thing I do differently is leave the pickling spice out.  Tried it once with it and did not care for it.

I don't have a dutch oven, so I cooked the roast in a crock pot instead.  It worked beautifully!

This was really great with a few changes.. nothing drastic, but instead of corn syrup, I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, melted with a couple of tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet.  Instead of the prepared mustard, I used stone ground.  SO GOOD!

I didn't use the oven for this recipe, just simmered the corned beef on the stove, then glazed it and put it in the toaster oven for ten minutes.  The glaze was really excellent, both for the dinner and as a spread for corned-beef sandwiches. I thought it would be too tart and "mustardy," but it was just right--a really wonderful, super-easy sweet and sour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cook my corned beef on top of the stove the old fashioned way and make my glaze as follows:  Glaze for Corned Beef
This is for a 3-4 pounds of corned beef (flat cut)
pickling spices are included in the packaging
Preheat oven to 350
After the meat has cooked with the cabbage, carrots, etc., remove from pan and place into oven proof dish,  fat side up
Spread the fat side with French’s yellow mustard,  
then mix together :
1/4 cup brown sugar with ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves

Pat this on top of mustard and bake for about 15-20 minutes or until nicely glazed….cut across grain into slices and serve
THIS IS RICH AND DELICIOUS….A NICE ELEGANT TOUCH TO THE USUAL CORNED BEEF!...ENJOY!

We just used the spice packet that came with the corned beef. I only had spicy brown mustard so I used 1/4 cup corn syrup and 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I ended up upping the mustard to 1/4 cup also. It was very watery from heating it on the stove and didnt coat it as thickly as I would have liked so I mixed another 1/4 cup brn sugar with 1/4c mustard coocked it and let it cool a bit to thinken before applying that as a second layer. Turned out fantastic, I've never seen my boys each so much meat at one sitting.

Having never really been a fan of corned beef I sure was surprised at how well this dish turned out.  The glaze is superb and really adds a nice finish to the meat.  After it came out of the oven, I let it rest for about an hour prior to slicing it up on our handy dandy Cabela's meat slicer which was set on a no. 2 setting.  It provided just the right thickness for sandwiches which adorned some wonderful homemade buns that the mrs. had made.  I know it was a hit because she went back for seconds, something she seldom ever does.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy, and it comes out so moist. Before you place the beef on the roasting pan line it with aluminum foil for easy clean up.

Since I had a point cut of corned beef, I trimmed as much of the fat as possible before cooking.  I used only maybe a scant teaspoon of the spice and it was plenty pungent enough for us.  Instead of corn syrup, used honey and brown mustard; didn't bother with the boiling.  Did not take long to broil up.  The meat was very tender and flavorful, the glaze gave just the right sweet/tart.

This dish is excellent, and very simple to prepare.  Even better are the Reuben Sandwiches you can make the next day from leftovers.  I served it with fried potato's and green beans.  My family has already requested to make again.  If you don't have a duchoven any covered casserole dish will do as long as you can put it in the oven.

Very tasty, my whole family loved it. I could have cooked the meat longer in the crock pot to make it more tender...but the glaze was wonderful!

Pretty good recipe. Very easy to prepare, I didn't use pickling spice (unsure what that is) so I just used the packet that came with the brisket. Overall I would make it again. I made it in a dutch oven and it cooked much faster than the 4 hours the recipe states. When I pulled it out at 2.5 hours it was at 210 degrees so a little overcooked. Broiling only took a couple minutes. So unless I am missing something I don't see how this is 4 hrs. Thank you for the recipe JAMVS!!

I just made the corned beef. I did not use the spice packet with it because I don't like all those hard seeds, so I didn't add any seasoning to it; believe me, it doesn't need it! We made two of them so each of our sons could take home leftovers. This was the BEST corned beef I have ever made and I've made some pretty good ones in the past 37 years. I had never baked/roasted one in the oven before. I didn't have a dutch oven that would fit both, so I used a very large, deep roasting pan. Put both of them in the one pan, filled it with water, but did not cover the top of the roasts. I then sealed the pan with foil, cooked it for two hours, checked it, recovered it and cooked it an additional one hour. I then made the glaze, while keeping the roasts in the hot oven. I poured the glaze over the fatty side of the roasts, turned the broiler on low broil and broiled them for about 15 minutes. Turned off the broiler, closed the oven door and let them rest for about 20 minutes while I cooked the rest of the meal. They both turned out perfect! Easy to slice, but didn't fall apart, yet very tender to bite into and the glaze was perfect! I used one full cup of the light corn syrup and 1-1/2 tspns of French's yellow mustard. I'll be making this again real soon.

Excellent I  followed the recipe almost exactly as written. My only differences were 1.that I do not own a Dutch oven so I used a deep baking dish with a lid and foil to ensure a good seal 2. I quartered red potatoes  and placed them around the meat on the broiling  pan and glazed both! A huge hit with my family  tonight! Thank you

I am rating this as an inspiration and not as an exact recipe.  I cooked a 4 lb. corned beef as described, but without the pickling spice, as I did not have any.  Just water in a covered dutch oven for three hours.  I prepared a glaze with 3 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. brown sugar, and 3 tbsp. dijon mustard on the stove top.  I broiled the beef on each side for 4-5 minutes, with a generous amount of glaze.  This was excellent!  The best corned beef we have ever had.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Good taste. But if you are used to slow cooked corned beef, this will appear tough. Just the noral difference in cooking methods, but...be warned.

Nice alternative to corned beef and cabbage.  Used honey instead of corn syrup though.  Very tasty.

After taste testing, I went with the 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of the syrup with the mustard for glaze, as another reviewer suggested. Was a tasty dish.

VERY GOOD DISH MY FAMILY LOVED IT. I COOKED ON TOP OF STOVE. THEN GLAZED IT WITH THE MUSTARD GLAZED. I USED BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD. MUCH BETTER THAN CORN SYRUP I THINK
