Reading the reviews is very important on Allrecipes. It made sense to me that cold ingredients might work better. Mine worked perfectly with EASY tweaks as follows.

1) I CHILLED the oil first in the fridge for a couple of hours.

2) First I used a mortar and pestle to grind together garlic and salt into a paste. (Keep salt to a minimum). This step is optional but worked well.

3) I added the garlic mixture and eggs to food processor and blended until just combined.

4) Turned the processor on and added the oil, scraping the container regularly during the blending.

I used a food processor for the whole thing and it came together very quickly. About 10 minutes for entire process, and it's really the texture of mayonnaise. I added the lemon juice at the end of blending and it smoothed it out to a lovely consistency and gave it a nice little acidity. Highly recommend.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I am vegan and found if you use 1/4 cup of Nayonnaise instead of the eggs, it is fantastic and my non-vegan guests were none the wiser!!

I added more garlic gloves than specified, and it increased the intensity. The recipe makes quite a bit of aioli, so I would probably half it the next time.  I served it on crab cakes and it was delicious.

There is an old wives tale from Spain that says, when beating in the olive oil 1) always go in the same direction and 2) don't look at it while beating it, look away.  Else the mixture will be too watery.

nice simple base. i roasted my cloves of garlic in the oven in their jackets, then squeezed them out, gave a nice little variation.

This is very good!! The best way to make alioli is using a blender. Mix the eggs, garlic and salt in the blender for a few seconds and then start adding the oil in a fine stream with the blender runing (don't stop it). When the desired consistency is adquired add the lemon juice. It will be ready in less than 6 min.

Tastes like home. I like to use an electric hand mixer its so much faster and gives the exact same taste and texture. Granted the traditional recipe does not have eggs but it is a lot harder to make and wears your arm out. My family uses this egg recipe all the time. Grill sliced potates and pork chops and use this as a slathering or dipping side and WOW, welome to SPAIN.

This was my first attempt at making aioli from scratch - and I don't know whether I messed something up, or if this is just a gross recipe, but considering I'm a pretty good cook, I believe this just isn't a very good recipe.  We found the flavour of garlic to be waaaay over the top, half as much would have been plenty...so I ended up trying to add more lemon juice. oil and another egg yolk (don't do this, it turned out horribly).  So in the end, I just added about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise.  It still wasn't very good, but edible at least.

This is a classic aioli.  It has a nice kick to it but yet not to much of a bite.  It goes wonderful dolloped on an oyster, and sucked right back.

This is a PERFECTLY GOOD RECIPE.  It just requires that you use the old "noggin'" a bit to get it to come together for you.

What everyone below who was unsuccessful seems to be complaining about is that the aioli didn't thicken.  Making garlic mayo is like making ice cream or butter.  You need to CHILL before, during, and after you beat the eggs and oil together.  I used a "double freezer" method - same concept as making ice cream - to keep my mixing bowl cold while I beat the eggs and oil.  Use an ice bucket or a big bowl of ice and put your mixing bowl on top of that and mix away!  That will cool and congeal the eggs and oil.

Easy recipe, I roasted the garlic then whirled everything together in the blender on low speed while slowly drizzling in the oil. I added a bit more lemon juice and it went extremely well with BBQ cedar planked salmon that my son had just caught earlier that day.

Not sure what I did but it tasted bad.  Seemed like to much olive oil in it.  It looked very good but the taste was gross.  Friends thought so also and it went down the drain.  Crab Cakes were a hit though with Dijonnaise out of the bottle.

I liked the way the Aioli came out. I used an expensive brand of first-cold-pressed-EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). Any other olive oil may overwhelm the recipe.  I used a garlic press which presses out the oils and sweet part of the garlic clove while retaining the bitter parts . I also chilled the bowl and beaters (I used and electric hand egg beater this time). I am able to buy pasturized eggs at a local grocery store, which is much safer when eating raw eggs - no fear of salmonella. Next time I think I will try an electric hand (stick) blender with the round-flat whipping blade attached.

I love the basic overview of the recipe, however, I agree with the other reviewers....the garlic is sooo0o overwhelming it stings.  I also ultimately added mayo and more lemon in attempts to combat the pungent flavor.  I will make this again, but I think perhaps I will half and saute the garlic to give the aioli a more subtle taste.

Perhaps it was just me, but this didn't seem to blend very well, and as an end result didn't turn out to be very tasty. Perhaps it's just easier to buy jarred mayonaise and put the garlic and lemon juice in there? Will not be making this again.

I have been making aioli for 40 years or more. The trick (like mayonnaise) is to go slowly, oh so slowly with the oil in the beginning. I think 4 cloves of garlic is far too much for 2 eggs and 1 cup of oil, but it depends on the size of the cloves. I don't chill anything and I don't use a blender or a whisk......just a plain old wooden spoon.  If the whole thing won't 'take' after a while and it looks curdled, use another yolk in another bowl and pour the mix into it , slowly, until it has taken and then go ahead.

This did not work out for me & I have no idea why.  I mixed this for a very long time (probably 20 mins in total) and it was still runny. I tried mixing it when it was cold & also tried adding another egg yolk, still too runny :/

I halved the recipe because I just wanted to try it first and use it with sandwiches.  It turned out perfectly delicious.  I had no problems with the consistency and the flavor was good.  I spread it on two pieces of bread, added my meat, topped with pepper jack cheese, and put it in the broiler.  When I took it out I added some lettuce and tomato and put it back in the broiler to toast both sides of the bread (flipped it).  I thought it was wonderful as far as sandwiches go.  I will definitely make this again and try with more of a meal recipe next time.

No matter how much I whisked and no matter the food processor I could not get the base to be "light and creamy."  Creamy it was, light it wasn't.  I ended up using store mayo with the lemon, garlic, salt, and pepper added, which is likely what I will do anymore.

Too eggy for me. I have made home made mayo before and know how to pour and beat the oil in just right, but something was just wrong with the portions here. . .
And I agree with most in here that more garlic and a bit more lemon in needed. . . Personally you can never put a max on garlic and lemon when it comes to seafood. . .

Aioli was great - very little effort, nice sauce, perhaps a bit too garlicky for our tastes.  Maybe three cloves? This seems like it would be a great recipe to omit the garlic and add other flavors to if desired, as well. Boyfriend added small amount of tabasco and enjoyed.

This is a terrible recepie for aioli! I've done aioli from scratch many times and never failed. Now I wanted to try a new recepie and tried this. To "mince" the garlic is not a good idea and besides its far to much garlic! It should be made in a food processor with half the garlic, and I am truly a garlic lover. When I then read the reviews a lot of people who gave it 5 stars totally alterered the recepie and used a blender or food processor, less garlic and added salt.

THIS WAS not to my liking! I've had awesome Aioli before and this was nothing like it. My boyfriend and I LOVE garlic and this just had way too much. Other recipes like it have just one clove . . . maybe they are onto something. I don't know I just know that this was awful. I tried adding it with mayo and everything but it just wasn't good. I tried to like this recipe but I just couldn't.

This aioli didn't turn out the way I had anticipated (consistency-wise) but served as a pretty decent condiment for toasted bread.

This was really good! I didn't chill the olive oil, and just whisked the ingredients with a fork -- it turned out perfectly with a nice creamy consistency. I did add a bit more garlic than called for, and also a titch of honey -- just my own personal preferences. My husband said it was the best aioli I have made yet. It was very nice on cold smoked salmon. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I hated this recipe.  I made it twice back to back to try and get a better flavor but YUCK.  The garlic was WAY too strong in the first batch (4 cloves).  And the second bath was bland even after I added a lot of sale and cayenne pepper.  I think I would be better off just jazz-ing up some mayo next time...lol.  I wanted to try it to make it from scratch, but failed on this one.

Good recipe but a little heavy.  I usually just make a quick aioli using mayo, milk, garlic and lemon juice. (Weight Watchers)  Much lighter even though not true aioli.

There was too much olive oil and it tasted of raw egg.  I followed the recipe precisely, and used a hand mixer but the consistency was not one of a creamy Aioli.  I definitely think the ingredient portions are off somewhat.

Took another reviewer's reccommendation to cut the recipe in half and that was plenty for several sandwiches. We like lots of garlic, so we used a garlic infused olive oil. It was easier than I thought!

Yikes... I didn't like this.  But I had never had aioli sauce before so I didn't know exactly what to expect.  It's probably more just a personal taste than the recipes fault.  I wouldn't make it again.  My boyfriend said it tasted like cardboardy butter.

I'm giving this 3 stars, it get a 5 if it hadn't been missing an ingredient.  I tried this as written and nothing I did make this fluffy or creamy.  It was liquid.  Smelled great but it was liquid.  All of my ingredients were all chilled prior to preparing.  Everything was dry.  I've made mayo before so I know the tricks.  Seems to me, one of the key ingredients to aioli/mayo is missing.  Vinegar.  Thought I would try it as written it didn't work.  The second I added 1 teaspoon of white vinegar, it got creamy and fluffy.  That one item made the difference.

I will remake this but I will get out the good evo!  I was able to increase the flavor with some more lemon and salt!  It was also much better after chilling in the fridge.

First attempt and it turned out good. I really liked it. only change I made to this recipe was i cooked the egg mixture over slow heat continuously without scrambling the eggs and put it in ice bath immediately.

I make mine in the food processor.. i throw the garlic cloves in and "mince" them.. then add the egg, salt, pepper.. let it mix. Now when making this is is crucial that you add the oil veeeeery slowly with just a tiny stream.. Do not stop in the middle, keep adding the oil until it is gone at the same pace. When it is set add the lemon juice.

Works best with room temperature eggs; additionally, when using a food processor or blender use one yolk and one whole egg. Dash in some of the lemon juice, add eggs, 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt and peppers and then blend until bound. Then add the rest of the ingredients and blend for two minutes.

This is very good.  My mom suggests adding: 
1 tablespoon sweet paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco

This will make it a little bit spicy
