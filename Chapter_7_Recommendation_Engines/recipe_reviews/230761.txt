I have a friend who is a bartender who taught me how to make this drink years ago. If you don't have cinnamon schnapps, Fireball whiskey works just as well. This is off the charts delicious. May not technically be "carrot cake" flavored, but it's still darn tasty.

This was a very interesting cocktail; didnâ€™t taste anything like a carrot cake, but it was a nice try.

I didn't like it much until i added 1.5 to 2 jiggers kahlua. Now it is somewhat carrot cake-ish, definitely good and drinkable.
