This is pretty good. The chocolate sauce is really yummy! It does not fit in a pie pan, however. I put it in a bundt pan instead.

This was pretty tasty. I used chopped nuts out of a pack from the grocery, and whipped cream! It was like a real sundae. It was just so difficult to spread the ice cream on the wafers in the bottom of the pan. But pretty good, anyway.

IMO too much chocolate sauce.  I made it all but only used half or it would have overpowered the ice cream.  Didn't taste bad - how can you go wrong with ice cream and chocolate - but just wasn't great.  Probably won't make again.  Sorry!

Replace the pecans with toffee chips, the chocolate is tooooooo strong, try a bit less chips and a bit more marshmallow.

I made this delicious dessert for a holiday party and no one could believe I made an ice cream pie all by myself!  It was a hit - within 5 minutes the pie plate was empty!  The best part about it was that it took only 10-15 min to make!  I highly recommend this for those who want to make something original, tasty and easy!!

It was great hit. I reduced the chocolate a bit. I also made it in small individual pie crust and let everyone fix their own topping which was really fun.

This tastes really good and it's simple to make, but it's way too much for one pie dish!
