The recipe is very good. The name is very unappealing.

I didn't read the recipe through so I never had a chance to marinate the brisket.  Even though the meat did not marinate, it was so tender.  I thickened the marinade with cornstarch after it was done cooking.  It made a delicious gravy.  I did not have liquid smoke but I don't think I would have liked it anyway and I only had one can of beef broth.  I really don't think that two cans are necessary.  I will definitely make this again.

I have always thought that if you are going to use marinade for sauce you should make extra and set it aside.  I made the marinade and it is really good but I made extra and discarded the meat soaked marinade in the bag.  Very tender...and the name doesn't fit.

This brisket met with approval when I served it to family and a guest.  The meat was tender and tasty and the pan juices made a nice addition on the plate.  I had hoped for a little more flavor in the center of the meat, so I sliced the leftovers and sealed them up in a container with the juices poured over the top.  The next day, the flavor was a lot more consistent.  Next time I make this, I will seal the marinated meat and the marinade in heavy foil, place in a roaster, and bake at 350 for about 4 hours, as I do with another brisket recipe, in hopes of working the flavor deeper into the meat.  We will be trying this again - it's well worth the experimenting time!

Strange name that brings strange comments but this is a winner and crowd favorite. Makes the kitchen smell great as a bonus.
