A great peanut brittle recipe. However, the recipe needs one little correction. Boiling the sugar, water and corn syrup to the "hard ball" stage makes a sticky, chewy candy. Heating to 300F degrees creates a more traditional peanut brittle.

The trick is to let it get golden brown for that buttery, caramel flavour.  We made several batches, tinkering with the proportions to get the taste and texture just right (for us!)  Peanuts 1 1/3 cups, 3/8 tsp sea salt, 3 tbsp real butter and we decreased the baking soda to 3/4 tsp.  We prefered batches that were fork-teased.  The result was tender, buttery and not too foamy. I also found adding peanuts a little later - two or three minutes after syrup had come to a bubbling boil - helped prevent the nuts from becoming too toasty.  Also fabulous with whole almonds.  Thanks to all above reviewers, you helped!

One of 2 very similar recipes on here.  Combine the instructions together for best results.  I used 1C of peanuts and would use more next time.  When you add the peanuts the temperature will drop, resist the temptation to crank up the setting on your stove.  Mixture will shortly return to temp and begin climbing.  I think where most have problems is they cook on too high of a setting.  After adding peanuts, continue cooking until it reaches 300 degrees (until it is "light brown" is too vague for me when making candy).  Until water initially boils off, temperature will climb rather slowly (this is NORMAL for all candy making), just have to give it a few minutes.  Recipe says to cover for 3 min. but I don't see that matters, the whole point of the initial cooking is to boil off the water.  Certainly recommend a candy thermometer for best/most consistent results since that ice water method is very imprecise unless you have extensive candy making experience.  Would also be great with other types of nuts (i.e. almonds or cashews).  Pour hot mixture on lightly buttered aluminum foil, let sit until cool then break into desired size pieces.

This was my first attempt at making peanut brittle, and it turned out great!  I always use a candy thermometer, and had read on another recipe to cook it to 300 degrees.  I did that for this recipe, and it turned out with just the correct amount of brittleness.  It's buttery and sugary...tastes wonderful.  Next time, I will add a few more peanuts, but I really love the brittle just as it is.

Delicious!!! On my first batch I didn't know what to expect so I over used the butter and under used the peanuts, Next batch though I doubled the peanuts and left the butter to just what I greased the pan with...PERFECTION!!!! My husband and kids will have it all gone by the time the holidays even start, which is fine because it was a cinch to make! Enjoy!!!

Maybe I did something wrong I don't know I have never tried to make hard candy before but I thought this was the one since I did not have a candy thermometer. I followed the directions plus cooked it for another 12 min. that is how long it took to get to hard ball stage. I ended up with a very chewy candy. Needless to say I bought a candy thermometer. Will try again.

Delicious! It's important to allow the butter to brown to give it the proper color.  I took it to 300 degrees. Make sure that the baking soda is still good and I have been told (by granny) that the humidity in the air can also make a difference.

This recipe worked well for me and I have a fear of peanut brittle--it never worked for me before. My first batch scorched slightly but still tasted good. I doubled the recipe for the second batch and cooked it to just slightly above the soft-crack-stage; turned out perfect! 

I think many have forgotten that this recipe reads to add the peanuts and butter at the soft-ball-stage and then continue to cook. If you do not bring this to at least the soft-crack stage
then add the vanilla and soda mixture it will not set up.

Good stuff! Thanks!

I'm only giving 4 stars because I forgot to take the advice of others and bring the sugar up to 300 degrees (hard crack stage).  My peanut brittle, although very tastey, is really sticky.  I had to put it outside on the ice to get it to set so I could break it up.  I have to eat it very carefully!

I really liked this recipe. Loved the bit of salty with the sweet. This is the 1st time I've made peanut brittle on my own. And I followed to a T. The only thing negative I would say is...more peanuts. Other then that, excellent recipe.

I made this recipe with cashews rather than peanuts but otherwise followed exactly and it came out pretty good. Just really make SURE that you get the temp up to 250F and let it linger there for a few minutes, otherwise you end up with something that's not "brittle" but is too stick-to-your-teeth to be taffy. I'm not kidding, it'll pull the roots right out of your head!

This was my (and my daughters) first attempt at Peanut Brittle.   It turned out perfect!    I was always intimidated by making candy - but after this I will try more.

my candy turned out good and the taste was excellant.  but when I put in my baking soda at the end of the cooking process the candy started sweeling up over the top of the pan. it just kept boinling over and over, the next time I put it in a large pan so it wouldn't boil all over the stove.

I'm sure after reading the other reviews that I did something wrong. I have a chewy, teeth removing mixture. Cover me, I'm going back in for another try.

This was my first time making peanut brittle and I followed the advice of other readers and added 1 cup of peanuts, used a candy therm. and cooked it to 300 degrees.  Well, this batch I had to throw away!  It started burning before it ever got to 300 and there were far to many peanuts...So I adjusted the temp. and added the butter and 3/4 cup of peanuts to the sugar at 250 degrees.  I pulled it from the heat at 275 degrees and added the baking soda/salt/vanilla and water, stirred quickly and poured it out on the buttered pan.  The peanut brittle is perfect, but I can only give this recipe 4 stars because the lack of details such as what to set the heat at to cook the sugars ( I chose medium/high).

Yum! I would've given this 5 stars, except that I took other reviewers' alterations and doubled the peanuts and cooked it to 300 -- without those changes, I don't think it would be nearly as good. But WITH those changes, fantastic.

This was my first time making brittle and I followed the directions precisely using a candy thermometer and it turned out great!  I added a full cup of the Spanish peanuts and the only trouble I had was when I put it on the buttered cookie sheet, my peanuts weren't all cooperating.  My peanuts all went to one side only.  I completely think my issues were operator error and I will be using this recipe again and mixing it up with other nuts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This could not of came out more perfect!! It was gone quickly. I do not have a candy thermometer and I did not need one. It's easy to know when it's at the hard-ball stage when u can hold a spoon over it and it drips stringy and "web-like." Deffinately took a while to get to that stage, but was well worth the wait!

Just made this easy recipe.  Wonderful!  I added a little more peanuts and some vanilla.  I stirred continuously which prevented burning the peanuts.  Lovely caramel color and tastes delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made two batches and would have been nice if the directions stated it had to come to Hard crack stage before pouring into pans. Mine came out real chewy and I wasted all those ingrediants.

After burning a batch of the "easy microwave" kind, I reverted to the tried and true stovetop method.  After burning another batch at the sugar stage (gotta watch it close and keep stirring), I successfully made my first batch of awesome, buttery peanut brittle.  The only modification I made was to heat to the 300 degree stage.  Sounded like a winner to me to avoid pulling fillings out.  Great recipe!!

First time I made this, I didn't think it was as great as everybody said. Second time, I cooked it to about 305. I took it off the heat, added the baking soda with a tiny pinch of cinnamon, 2 cups of hot peanuts, and the butter. And then I loved it.

If you add popcorn to the mixture when it is being boiled, it tastes great! Just roll the popcorn into balls about the size of a small apple and let it dry. My class loved it!

It was OK, but it wasn't special.  It was the first time to make peanut brittle and I was expecting a more baking soda fizz to it so I was disappointed.

IT'S PERFECT! (Think Santa Claus 2) this is my first time trying peanut brittle. I have always thought it was way too difficult for me. I do have to say, it took me two batches to get it right. My first batch was too chewy. i thought i was going to need dental work, lol. However, I did not have a candy thermometer for the first batch. I highly recommend one. I did increase the amount of nuts to a cup and left all other ingredients the same. Being the first time, this is what I encountered while making this.  First, I thought it took quite a long time to get to the hard ball stage (if you insist on trying this without a thermometer, another description of the hardball stage is I stirred the mixture with a fork and then held it above the pan, when a drop fell back down, it left a string like a strand of spider web).  It taking longer than i anticipated could have been because I had read that you shouldn't cook too fast/hot, so I had my burner on a medium high.  During cooking, I did turn up to high.  Once you reach the hardball stage and put in the nuts, it doesn't take too much longer.  It will foam up some when you put the nuts in. Make sure you do have everything ready for the next steps as you won't have time at this point.  One thing that I noticed on my first batch, it didn't seem to brown at all.  I'm sure this is all because I didn't get it hot enough. This is really a great recipe for brittle. I will definitely use this recipe again.

First of all, I didn't like the color of it.  It turned out sort of a beige color.  Not very eye appealing.  Second, the taste was off.  I will not make this again as my family thought it was not very good.

I am not a fan of peanut brittle.  My 83 year old boss is a fiend for it and once threw out a whole box because it didn't taste right.  So, for Christmas this year, I decided to make this recipe for him.  First time EVER making peanut brittle OR anything candy-like.  I bought a candy thermometer and cooked it to 300° like the instructions on the package said.  I shelled roasted peanuts (1 cup shelled) because I couldn't find Spanish peanuts.  Everything else I did as instructed (though perhaps used too much butter when buttering my cookie sheet...).  The brittle was perfect!  Even I liked it!  The cooking went smoothly, except when the thermometer fell into the pan, and my boss was very happy with his gift! :)

I love this recipe. The only thing that I add is vanilla. I use spanish peanuts which are not cooked so I add them into the mixture before it reaches 300. It will drop the temp. a little when you add them but it fine still goes up after awhile. Only down side with them is that you have to becareful so you don't burn the peanuts but i like them better then roasted peanuts for this recipe

Thank you for posting this recipe! It reminds me of my mom's just like she made when I was young! This was my first attempt at brittle, so I learned a few things! You really do need to keep your eyes on brittle! I slightly scorched the peanuts when I turned to the sink for only 2 seconds! However, people told me it was better that way, because they hate when the peanuts are still raw! So I guess my oops turned into a success! I did add a bit more peanuts, and didn't use a thermometer, but it turned out excellent. (Don't worry, the candy thermometer is on my Christmas list!)

Made it once then read the reviews.  I tried it again with the adjustments suggested on the temperature.  Still so chewy it pulled my husbands filling out.  Will not try it again.

Cant imagine what I did wrong - I have made before and have had success but that was years ago - so I sought out a new recipe and follow this to a T.  See my pics - can't figure out what went wrong.  Wish recipe would give an idea of how long it should take to get to 270 - it took a long time for me.  
I started off med low and dissolved sugars w corn s and h2o...rasied heat and left it untouched until it came to 270 - each time I checked on it was progressing - but when I checked when it was at 240 it was dark brown and the air smelled burnt.
Decided to go thru and make it as maybe the butter and baking powder would adjust color but no luck - anyone know what might have happened?

This recipe needs an exact temperature at which the soda is to be added. The mixture was light brown at various temps so I chose to add the soda mixture at 295 deg. It did not get foamy as most recipes I am used to and did not get very dark in color. If you want a brittle that can be teased this might be the exact thing you are looking for.  After it cooled a bit, I attempted to tease it and found it quite easy to do. Also the peanuts seemed undercooked to me. Not my kind of brittle.

i had followed the recipe "exactly" the way it was here and the results I got were not that great. I put the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, 2/3 cups of water, and the 2/3 cup of the light corn syrup in a pot and brought it to a boil. Next I added the 2 tablespoons of butter and the peanuts. Then in a separate bowl, I put the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, the 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water. I mixed that all together and poured that into the boiling mixture and stirred. I took it off the stove and poured onto the cookie sheet. I let cooled for 2 hours but nothing hardened to look like peanut brittle.  It is still in the gooey state.  Why is this like this ? Where did I go wrong that it did not turn out like peanut brittle? if you have any suggestions, please let me know. I would definitely appreciate any feedback. Thank you.

Easy and good brittle! I used a little more than half the salt and I like it better. Also, make sure it's not too brown when you take it off the heat to put in the baking soda mixture, the liquid in that mixture can burn your syrup and peanuts slightly if too hot.

This needed a whole lot more peanuts in my opinion.  Mine didn't come out well at all.  It was tacky.

Came out perfect on my first try. Did not have a candy thermometer, cooked until it was brown and thick.  Will definitely buy a candy thermometer.  Recommended to all!!!

Boiled it to 300F, put peanuts (1cup) in at 250F, followed other reviewers advice. While end result did harden, it got really chewy after a few seconds of being chewed. Does that make sense? It didn't stay crunchy. I don't know if that's because of the humidity (I'm in Alaska, so that shouldn't be a problem) or the baking soda. Maybe the soda was old? I dunno. I found another recipe that doesn't call for baking soda, so I'm going to try that one instead.

Unfortunately, it came out very chewy, despite using a thermometer to make sure I got to the right heat before taking it off. The consistency seemed fine as well. Oh well. It's much like a hard candy jolly rancher that gets chewy after so long. 

So it came out well, just not hard like it was supposed to.

I really like this recipe as it yields a very flavorful peanut brittle.  Usually I just cook a recipe on AllRecipes as originally written and tweak it the next time I make it, but I read the other reviews and implemented other people's suggestions. I prefer my peanut brittle to be more, well, brittle, and cooking to 300° gave the perfect result.  I like lots of nuts, so I doubled the quantity to 1 cup.  Again, perfect. The only thing I would change next time is that I wouldn't make a "slurry" of the salt, baking soda, vanilla, and water.  I'd keep the wet and dry ingredients separate.  Overall, excellent!

I tried this recipe today. I doubled it and had 2 cookie trays. I kept the cookie trays warm and just tilted the pans to spread it. Awsome brittle. Now to keep the boyfriend out of it till Christmas.

Delish!!!  Easy & my first attempt at brittle or candy for that matter.  Not sure how I actually already had a candy thermometer in my drawer, but I used it all the way up to 300 degrees.  Best tip was having butter & soda ready to add in at the end (vanilla too).  You do have to constantly stir or it can burn quickly.  Next time, I'll grease the cookie sheet with butter rather than Pam- was concerned about how much mess was left over & there isn't any! It quickly set up & I was breaking it into pieces within 10 min.  Family loves it!!!   Will make many times over!

This is pretty good.  Maybe could've used some more peanuts.  I'm not a huge fan of peanut brittle so I don't quite remember if it supposed to stay stuck in your molars for a while or not.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. After looking at all the rest, I decide to try this one, and we sure are glad we did. It is so easy and delicious. My husband and I have made it for the past 4 years every christmas and give it out as gifts. Our family and neighbors look forward to it every Christmas. Absolutely wonderful!
