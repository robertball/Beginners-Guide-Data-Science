This came out very moist, dark and rich. It took a bit longer to bake than stated in the recipe.

Not sure what it tastes like yet, but I followed this to a T, and the batter was so think it would not pour..... I some how got it in the baking pans, and baked it so we shall see...... I keep looking back to see what I did wrong and I still cannot figure it out....
