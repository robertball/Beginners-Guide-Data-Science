Great recipe! We are gluten-free so I replaced the all purpose flour with brown rice flour.

This was a hit!  I made it exactly as written and it was yummy.  It was wonderful served with a sweet and sour sauce.  My family is already requesting I make it again.

I did NOT make changes to the recipe.  I did, however, read MANY of the comments and all of them helped make this dish a success (better than Outback, folks!).  The best tip that I got was cold, cold, cold.  I made the batter the night before and refrigerated the shrimp in coconut milk (I don't think that added anything).  I coated the shrimp and rolled them in unsweetened coconut (Bob's Redmill) and refrigerated them for 6 hours.  The next tip is to have your oil the proper temperature.  If the oil is not hot enough (357 degrees F) or your shrimp/batter not cold, the coating WILL fall off.  A lot of people mentioned using smaller shrimp.  It seems to me that if you want to get that perfect golden brown color, it takes 3-4 min and a small shrimp will be mush.  I don't know for sure, but I used colossal shrimp and they were PERFECT.    I also used, as did many, the wonderful recipe for the orange marmalade sauce.  I did have one guest say that she would have preferred the sauce without the honey.  Everyone else loved it and I can recommend it with, or without, the honey.   I did use a deep fryer, but with the cost of avocado oil, the level was not very deep.  What IS great about the fryer is the ability to control the temperature.  When it says 375, it IS 375. I have a smaller fryer and only did 4-5 shrimp at a time in about 3" of oil.  They were not at all greasy and the paper towels had very little oil on them.  This recipe is a bit time consuming, but you can do everything

after a while the coconut would get clumpy and it was hard to keep it stuck to the shrimp.

I found this to be a great base for a beer batter.  I used bud light lime and didn't have coconut on hand so I added grated orange rind to the batter and rolled the shrimp in plain bread crumbs.  It had a great flavor. My husband was impressed with the taste as he hates shrimp and LOVED this meal.

Followed recipe and only adjusted oil temp down to 350f. At 375 coconut burned too quickly. I used coconut oil . Friends loved it and can’t wait to make for my visiting daughter!

It was easy to make.  Tasted like the Coconut Shrimp from Bahama Breeze.  We loved it!   Made a dip of Marmalade jelly and honey.

Really great recipe. My batter was the perfect consistency. I accidentally mixed the flour with the coconut. I will do it as it advised next time because some of the coconut didn’t stick very well. Also, I only had unsweetened coconut on hand and I’ll correct that next time too.  I’m not fond of reviews when recipes changes were made. BUT, even with my mis-steps this was delish. I also made the orange marmelade dipping sauce mentioned. However, I did heat it up a bit with more horseradish and hot sauce,  as we like spicy and hot.

These were great! I chilled my shrimp after coating them and had no problems with the batter not sticking. I ran a little short of the coconut and had to bread about a half dozen of my shrimp in panko, and they were great too. The coconut ones were better though!
