Thanks Michele!  These bars were just delicious.  The frosting is a big part of their appeal for me.  I added Cinnamon, Cardamom, Nutmeg and Cloves to the batter to make them Orange Spice Date Bars.

Excellent flavor and fairly easy to prepare. I have never made or eaten date bars before so I can't say how the date flavor comes through, but I thought they were very tasty as did my whole family. I ommited the orange zest in both the bars and frosting as I just don't care for zest.  I increased the amount of OJ in the batter by a couple of tablespoons instead.  The batter is very much the consistancy of a thick pancake batter. The recipe didn't state when to add the pecans so I mixed them in last. I put it in a glass pan instead of the jelly roll pan because I think it would have spilled over.  The recipe for the frosting makes way too much.  Half to 2/3 of the recipe would have been enough.  I also added two tablespoons of milk to make it creamy before adding the OJ.  These were very good and I will definately make them again.

This is to die for good. The cake part is yum by itself, but the frosting takes it from good to amazing. I followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe! I made it without any sugar by substituting apple juice for the water. I am also gluten free so I used almond meal in place of the flour. It was delicious!
