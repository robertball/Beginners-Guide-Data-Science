We love roasted asparagus.  I don't know if the initial steaming (blanching) is really necessary.  We like our asparagus on the crisp side though.

I did not bother messing with the steam step. I just layered the asparagus on the baking sheet and followed the rest of the instructions as listed. I did add a sprinkling of salt. I did bake mine just a touch longer--almost 15 minutes. Pretty good. No leftovers--what my family did not eat, I did.

Delicious! Only thing I did was add the lemon juice before baking, because I like my asparagus green. Other than that, this one's a keeper!

In my opinion, steaming the asparagus before roasting it is not only an inconvenient, unnecessary step that uses more pans, but it may even result in overcooking the asparagus once it finally makes it to the 475 degreee oven.  I roasted mine in a 400 degree oven alongside the fish I prepared for dinner.  Both were done in 15 minutes (as a point of reference my asparagus were on the thicker side)  For a seasoning twist I used Penzey's Chicago Steak Seasoning instead of just ground pepper.  Easier and five-star excellent if simply roasted in the oven, period.

So delicious! Did NOT steam the asparagus....just roasted it. Squeezed the fresh lemon over the asparagus after it was roasted and that gave an awesome fresh flavor. My family inhaled this veggie last night and I ws glad I mande 2 bunches because it was gone. Skip the steaming and go right to roasting....you wont regret it. Thanks!

This was an absolute success. I normally have leftovers, not tonight. I used some tips from other people who made this. I baked it at 475 for about 12 minutes and then broiled it for about 4 minutes. I added the lemon juice prior to cooking and it kept that vibrant green color. I added a little salt as well. I did skip the steaming as we prefer a little crunch to our asparagus. This is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the tips.

I made this recipe two ways - one with the blanching, as written and one without.  Really cannot see a reason to blanch. The taste is there, and the Parmesan cheese is a nice touch.

I make this all the time only I add 4pcs minced bacon and 1 tbsp garlic and only a touch of oil to kick this up a notch. You can skip the steaming step all togeher.

I love this simple recipe for roasted asparagus! And I defend steaming asparagus beforehand (or blanching - my preferred method). While that is debatably optional and indeed time-consuming, if you like asparagus as much as I do, and buy a lot of it, steaming/blanching in advance is great so you can have some "tenderized" asparagus to use a lot in a lot of ways, like roasting in this recipe, sauteing for a pasta sauce, slicing up cold for a salad, or just enjoying  a quick asparagus snack on the run.

Did not steam.  I also didn't use the lemon, just my preference.  Baked them at 475 for 5 mins and then turned oven off and left in for another 5 mins.  They were good but not as good as the other recipes I've had from this site.

I did not steam the asparagus and forgot the lemon. I baked at 400 for about 10 minutes and they were a nice firm but tender texture.

I did not love this recipe, i followed it exactly and i feel as though it was missing something on the topping, it was however better than regular asparagus and it was something that i will make again but maybe add more seasonings.
