Really good homemade honey bbq sauce.  If you're not a sweets person, then add 1/4 cup of honey rather than 1/2.

Delicious!  I upped the honey and used an onion instead of a shallot... We used it for ribs and chicken and everyone RAVED!

This made for some decent BBQ sauce. I agree with another reviewer, I don't usually like sweet BBQ sauce so I did 1/4 cup of honey instead of the 1/2 for that reason. It needed a little extra tweaking so I also did 3/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I suggest modifying it a little if you decide to make it. Otherwise, good recipe. I'll probably do it again sometime.
