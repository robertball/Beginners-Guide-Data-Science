Delicious!  Easy enough for family, impressive enough for company.  Only change I made was to add the pan drippings to the gravy and use a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it just slightly.

We - four guys - made this for our wife’s Valentine dinner.  It was a huge hit.  We followed the recipe exactly.  I should have started the sauce earlier than I did, it took longer to reduce done than I expected but it all worked out fine in the end.  Another Chef John keeper.

The flavors all come together nicely. I probably used twice any much cranberry, but otherwise I followed the directions. Since I have a single oven and needed it at 350 for my vegetable, I cooked it for an hour. I enjoy all the prep stuff, so it was fun to make. Mine was not as uniformed as the picture in the roll configuration, but tasty none the less.

Another amazing recipe to impress for holiday! I used aged balsamic vinegar so it’s a bit acidic so I added some sugar which was just great! I will also use more cranberries as chef John did next time :D you can never get too many  cranberries can you ;)

Flavors are wonderful. Next time I'll have to pound the pork out much thinner, as I didn't get enough overlap. I seared the wrapped pork before putting it in the oven to give the bacon a headstart, which probably helped. We were too lazy to make the sauce and just used balsamic, which was nice, so can't comment on the sauce.
