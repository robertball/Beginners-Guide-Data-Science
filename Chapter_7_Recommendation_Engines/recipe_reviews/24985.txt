This was a great recipe.  Only thing I did differently was to add 3T cocoa, so that it wasn't such a bright red.  Very moist cake.  Frosting was perfect!  I've made a lot of red velvet cakes and this by far is the best tasting one.

Didn't so much care for the frosting but the cake was very moist and delicious. Too much red dye though- I agree to add some cocoa.

I felt sorry for this lil guy. I decided to give it my best shot. Hubby and kids liked it and I was OK with the fact that it was lower fat and calories. I did add the 3 Tbls of coco powder to it as well.  I wasn't crazy bout the frosting tho. The cake was completely cooled and the frosting was kinda falling down the sides. I have made a zillion bundt cakes and have never had a whole I the middle of my cakes, I did with this one, not sure why. Thank you Rhonda.

I don't know whether I did something wrong, but the cake flavor was way off. It had a great texture and the distinctive red velvet color, but I never would have identified it as red velvet by the flavor alone. I do agree with Louise that the icing was lovely.

I made this with store-bought applesauce, it was moist and soft and all BUT it tasted like apples!!! and no, i did not put too much of it, just as much as the recipe called for! I do remember having made this recipe before with homemade applesauce and it was fine, but it is just a red apple cake this time :(
