Okay I've made this twice and for those having trouble with the batter being to thick and pasty add more milk I've done this recipe with wild blueberries and it is awesome but I've added a crumb topping of  1/4 c brown sugar 1/2c flour 1/2 of stick of butter 1/2 tsp of nutmeg with chopped diced almonds mix together till crumbly crumbs mixture and  sprinkle over top then you can drizzle a cream cheese frosting for a coffee desert I'm doing another one but with cranberries and maybe pecans instead of almonds ... Always love to play around with it thanks for sharing we love it!!!!!

The cake batter was REALLY thick, and I had a tough time even spreading it into the bottom of the springform pan that I used.  After adding the strawberry-sugar mixture, I literally had to just drop the rest of the batter on the top.  The cake itself is more biscuit-y rather than cake-y, and even though it had both baking powder and baking soda, it didn't rise much.  It appeared to be a little dry coming out of the oven, so I added a glaze on the top.  I followed the recipe to the letter but ended up with a pretty small cake that wouldn't yield 10 servings in this house.  It's an OK strawberry coffee cake, but there are others that I prefer.  Thanks Manasi, but I'll probably stick with the other recipe which works better for us.

This is excellent.  Add a little more milk in the end and Yes it is thicker than you'd think, however it rises up beautifully.

I did not care for this recipe. The proportions are wrong and hard to mix.
