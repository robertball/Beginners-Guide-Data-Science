While I did make quite a few tweaks to this recipe, I feel that shows how versatile it is and how easily it can be tweaked to meet YOUR culinary needs.  This isn't really up my alley and I was prepared to "suffer" through it, but I LOVED it!  I'm normally a crust girl when it comes to pizza, but I loved the *guts* of this so much I forewent the crust!  I used homemade crust (Jay's Signature Crust from this site, previously frozen) to start and floured then dusted my pizza pan with cornmeal.  I just can't do nacho cheese sauce, so I spread a bit of salsa (I used Spike's Black Bean and Corn Salsa) and topped with some shredded cheddar for my base.  I used a little less than 16 oz of shredded frozen potatoes (enough to cover the entire pizza) and subbed chopped ham for chorizo (just don't care for sausage, though, obviously, chorizo would make this pizza if you like chorizo, but the hame worked well, too, if you don't).  I was a bit concerned about scrambling the eggs first, as I like some runny yolk when I have egg on my pizza, but they worked, too.  I topped with a Mexican bland shredded cheese AND a bit of shredded mozz/provolone.  I had to bake well longer than 20 minutes (and upped the temp considerably), but that may just be our oven.  This makes a really loaded pizza, so one slice is quite filling.  THANKS for the recipe!

One suggestion: I cook my meat with the salsa and reduce it down.

This recipe was outstanding!  I made it exactly as directed, and it turned out great!  I would definitely make it again.  The only change I would make would be to pre-bake the crust for 3-5 minutes ahead of time to help make it more firm and crispy.  I may too it with some chopped green onions for color.  Otherwise, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing!

We decided to try this for Cinco de Mayo. We liked it but both agreed it might be just as good as an omelet and skip the pizza crust.

My main complaint was with the crust. If I made this again, I would try the thin crust dough or pre-cook it a bit. The crust was soft and floppy even after cooking extra time. There were a lot of leftovers
