This is my recipe, except for all the changes they made, no water is added, and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar or dry wine should be added, and the peppers and onions should be added much sooner, to absorb all the flavors together, and I don't add any cayenne pepper, but do add garlic salt, garlic powder, and seasoning salt, done in this way it is 5 stars, done the way they listed, can't honestly tell you but doesn't sound right
Also, some other helpful tips, I use the same kind of beef you get for pot roast, and don't cut it up, after about 7 pr 8 hours of cooking it will start to fall apart, at this point open up the crock pot and pull it apart with a fork (if it doesn't happen easily - it's not ready yet) then cook another 15 minutes or so to absorb flavors best. Also I've found that half a can of tomato paste OR tomato soup works.  Once this starts cooking it makes a bunch of "sauce" itself.  
Adding some red wine didn't hurt either :)
hope you enjoy

I made this recipe using the red wine vinegar instead of water as NCBaking suggested.  It was excellent and my roommate who is cuban thought the same!  I will definitely make this one again soon.

I made it like the reviewer (the owner of the recipe) said to make it and my husband and I really liked it. This was something good to eat that was different from your traditional pot roast (which I still love). I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  As per other reviews, the more garlic the better.  We put the Ropa Vieja on tortillas last night and are going to eat the rest on rice for dinner tonight.  My wife cut up some fresh avocado to top the tacos and fresh lime is a must.

I add a can of tomatoes instead of paste.  I prefer the whole tomatoes; just add the entire can, juice and all.  That is usually all the liquid required.  If I don't have whole tomatoes, I just use what is in the pantry.  Onions, peppers, lots of garlic and pepper --- yummy and easy!

Awesome! I read others' reviews and added 2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar, 14 oz can of canned tomatoes, a can of tomato paste, a splash of red wine, garlic,  a beef boullion cube,and minced garlic, four bell peppers and 2 chopped onions.  served with the juice of 2 fresh squeezed limes,and added cilantro and avocado.  The beef cooked on high for 6 hours and fell apart, barely had to pull to shred it, it was so tender! Thanks for a great, easy, homemade meal! Leftovers are also amazing, have made this three times before this review!

As per author of the recipe, used red wine instead of water. Used a 'Bavette' (Flap) Beef and after 7 hrs, it came out quite tender. Wasn't crazy about the taste as it mostly tasted of the tomato paste and not much else. Probably my fault as I used one 13oz can of paste (too much).I also put all of the required spices, red pepper, green pepper, onion in 3 hrs prior to serving. Don't think I'll try this one again.

The dish was good. Not great, but good. My husband loved it "better than regular roast."  My 13 yo said it was ok.  I thought it could use something extra for some kick, but I wanted to try it the original way first.

I made this yummy dish and didn't make any changes to it. It was simple and easy to use. I enjoyed this recipie the way it was written. By adding several other ingriedents it becomes a whole different recipie.

A bland for my taste. I have to admit I forgot the garlic and I know that would have added flavor but this recipe reminded me of a plain pot roast, bland! The taste of the chuck pot roast was so overwhelming and disappointing. A true ropa vieja should be made with a flank steak. Trust me, I was born and raised on ropa vieja growing up in Miami. Trying so many different versions, this recipe was missing something, not just the garlic ;)

This roast beef turned out fabulous, everyone absolutely loved it! I had an eye round roast that was almost 4 pounds so I doubled the other ingredients. I also added a can of drained stewed tomatoes, which added a delicious, slightly sweet flavor. I chose to serve this as a roast, not shredded, with mashed potatoes and green beans with mushrooms. It took exactly 8 hours to cook, then I just slightly broke apart the roast and let it cook in the sauce for the remaining 30 minutes. This really is delicious, the sauce was great over the potatoes also. It doesn't seem like alot of sauce at first,  don't worry because as this begins to cook, it makes a TON of sauce on it's own. It actually reminds me of a wonderful tomato based chili sauce, and the beef was so tender. Very nice change from the basic, classic roast beef. I had many requests to make this again, it really went over well at my dinner party. Thanks for sharing, I will definitley use this recipe again :)

This is a fine base recipe, but served as-is, definitely lacks a certain "zing."  I always need to add extra vinegar, salt, and pepper before I serve it, and it still feels a bit bland to me.  There's something missing, but I haven't quite put my finger on it yet....

I've looked everywhere for a good ropa vieja recipe. My boyfriend is half Cuban and is very picky, because nothing is as good as his mom's, but he approved on this recipe. Its best if served traditionally, with white rice, blacks bean and fried plantains.

This recipe is basically "shredded Pot Roast", Not Ropa Vieja.  Ropa vieja is always made with FLANK steak (which allows for the long 'ropes' of shredded meat, which resemble the 'old clothes' from which the name is derived.  No proper Cuban restaurant in Miami or Victor's Café in NYC would use chuck pot roast; they use Angus Flank steak.  It is fine for what it is, but this is not Ropa Vieja.

I have to say, being Cuban and growing up with my Mother making this dish, I was not impressed. It lacked serious flavor, and the recipe was missing the green olives; so I added them in as well as some other spices.

As a Cuban growing up eating this and making it the old school way with either a pressure cooker for the meat or boiling it for hours then shredding the meat by hand. (Tedious) I hated making this dish..but tossing it in the crockpot not only makes my life easier but the meat is juicier.  The only thing about this recipe I don't add is the vinegar.  I don't like the taste it gives the sauce..I instead use about 1/2 cup beef broth and 1 medium sized can tomato sauce instead of paste. I also add the traditional spices of any Cuban dish..cumin and oregano. But overall this recipe is pretty good.

Simple easy recipe, can't believe that up until 2 months ago I only ever used a slow cooker to keep soup warm!  I did add all the ingredients from the start, also added a couple of Jalapeno's.  I'm not sure this is something I would make again but it made for a nice easy dinner tonight!

Very tasty.  I accidently bought chopped meat instead of a whole roast...shortened the cooking time and all was well.

It was excellent.  My husband loved it.  My meat was a little tough and next time I will let it cook a little longer.  Very nice flavor and will make it again.

This is good but I add a few white potatoes , a few tablespoons of Goya Capers & Olives and chopped cilantro and a cup of Burgundy wine.  The meat is so delicious and tender.  I serve it over white rice.

Dang!  This is tasty!  I put a spoonful of it in a warm and soft corn tortilla with a little sour cream and ate it taco style.  The sour cream mellowed out the tanginess.  My husband loved it over rice just like in the picture.

This also turns out well if you need to cook it in the oven!  I had defrosted the meat the night before, but forgot to put it in my slow cooker.  I set my oven at 275 and let it cook for a little over 2 hours.  It was delicious!!  Very moist and tender.  Keep in mind, every oven cooks differently!

This turned out really delicious! i was skeptical of the very little "liquid" i put in with the meat in the beginning, but in the end, the fat and juices from the meat itself provided plenty of yummy juice. also, i used a 4 qt slow cooker and not all the veggies fit! i would recommend using maybe half of each onion? i left some of it out myself. very very good recipe!

This was the best Ropa Vieja (and only) I've ever had!  This was good.  Hubby really liked.  I was afraid it was going to be too vinegar like so I added a pkt. of liptons beefy onion soup mix.  Good sauce and surprisingly sweet.

Wonderful!  Not the same old pot roast.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and all green peppers since that was what I had and it was delish!  Will make this again.

Excellent! My 12 years old inhaled this one on soft flour tortillas with a lil cheese and low fat sour cream. Did not change a thing...I did use a boneless chuck roast. I loved how the peppers and onion cooked down with the tomato paste. Very flavorful and delicious.  Served with Sweet Corn Cake from this site. Thanks!

Pretty easy, pretty good. It gets better, I'm sure, when you add spices depending on your own tastes. I will definitely try it again with a few tweaks.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I only used 1/2 of a green and 1/2 of a red pepper because that is all I had but, everything else was the same.  We had two last minute guests and they loved it also.  I served it with yellow rice and plantains. Two men and two 11 year old boys ate almost all of it!!

Delicious!  After reading some of the reviews...I only used half of the can of tomato paste and added a quarter cup more of the red wine vinegar.  I also added a chopped up jalapeno.  I only used a pinch of salt and pepper and the flavors from the peppers and onions after slow cooking for 8 hours were perfection!  I served it on top of a tostada shell with chopped lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream.  My party guests loved it!

Very very good.  I made it like the original chef said to do it and it was really good.  Actually the taste got even better the next day (not sure how that happened)  it was a HUGE hit with my teens and my husband.  Didnt change a thing and it was perfect!

Tasted great.  My husband didn't like eating the meat plain - he wanted it in a tortilla.  Super easy to make.  I guess I have a smaller crockpot because I could only fit in 1/2 the veggies.  But it still turned out ok.

The taste of this dish was all about the bell pepper. (Not in a pleasant way.)  I cut down on bell peppers and made this the original way according to NC;s directions, but using fresh tomatoes (tis the season) and it was very good.  The rating is for the botched up recipe, not the original.

Awesome recipe! Like everyone else I made a few changes for convenience but I'm rating with the original recipes: using half fresh bell peppers and one bag of frozen bell peppers with onion (all fresh is expensive here!),  adding 2 tablespoons of dry taco seasoning from the packet, 1 teaspoon each of cumin and oregano and upping the amount of salt to a full tablespoon. I also had 2.8 lbs of meat as that was the only portion available so please keep that in mind! We cooked it for 7 hours on low which kept the meat tender and seasoned without it becoming too soft. I served it on slices of thick bread with avocado slices and cilantro crema. Also used it in scrambled eggs the next morning with tortillas. Yummy!

This was really good, it smells salty while cooking but it really isn't. It has good flavor. I did add a little water while cooking because it looked like it was going to dry out/burn around the edges. I don't know how much of a difference it made. I put this over rice. I used the leftover rice and meat to make stuffed cabbage rolls. They were fantastic too!

It wasn't very flavorful.  I ended up adding cumin, coriander, and paprika which made it a lot better.  I eventually added barbecue sauce and made a bbq sandwich.

I wasn't a big fan of the overpowering tomato paste taste. I had to add a lot of extra seasonings to give it more flavor as well.

This is a great recipe.  My kids who don't care much for meat, couldn't stop talking about it.  I added additional spices, but other than that followed the recipe.  Thanks!

I never give a 5 but this was perfect- delicious and so easy.  I used flank steak instead of a pot roast and added in some length-wise sliced oonions from my garden (we like spicy) as well as a bit of cayenne.  Leftovers were used in a quesadilla.  Thanks for the great recipe!

So very yummy.  Although, I did change very minor things due to nutritional and time reasons, this was the most awesomely tender roast ever!!  I used a 1.5 lb sirloin tip roast(one that was actually larger, but I split since this only a family of 3) rather than the chuck, for the nutritional reasons.  Since I didn't start this until 2pm, I set the crock to high for about 3.5 hrs, then cut it down to low for another hour before shredding.  I did not use the green pepper(personal preference), plus used the yellow onion, since that is what I had on hand.  Otherwise....superb.  I served this on soft taco shells with sour cream, lettuce & cheese(which I had pico de gallo, though).  Yum

This is delicioso if you cook los platanos (plantain) when tey are yellow and you fry it..the sweet of the yellow planton, and the sauce of the ropa vieja mixed with rice is wayyyyyyyyyyy more better.....I used the fry green plantain chips with fry fish...delicioso and jamaican picante (hot sauce) better mmm....

We also found chuck roast to come out a bit greasy and went with flank steak the second time. The sauce is perfect! The cheaper meat gave us a better result for our family but the taste of the recipe is why we went for round two. So good! Served with rice. Thank you for sharing!

I used this recipe but added 1 cup green pitted kalamata olives packed in vinaigrette brine. I included that brine instead of red wine vinegar. I also used two large cloves of garlic sliced finely in place of powdered garlic. I added about 2oz. - 4oz. Of red wine when I started to shred the meat.

Made this to be used for the filling for street tacos, and it was absolutely fantastic.   My guests loved it, including the one raised with Spanish cooking, who'd had ropa vieja before.  He couldn't believe it was my first time making it.  Will absolutely be making this again.   Maybe for nachos, next time.

Followed the recipe exactly as posted until about 6 hours into cooking. The meat was very tender, which was 
 awesome! The downside was that despite the onions, peppers and garlic, it was pretty bland in flavor. 

So I doctored it up with some ground cumin, celery seeds and extra seasoning salt and garlic. I then shredded the beef so it could soak up all those extra flavors and let it cook for the last 2 hours. 

The result was very tasty. So this is a great starter recipe, but I would definitely up the spices next time. Hope this helps.

This was good! We added some red wine based on the comments, and also threw in a jalapeño pepper. Next time I will up the seasoning a bit to make it even more flavorful.

Great recipe! Flavors were nice & it was super easy to make. Next time I’m going to add a bay leaf and sear the meat prior to slow cooking to add some depth of flavor.

This was a very good recipe. However, I did change one thing.  I did not have any tomato paste, so I used a seasoned paste (Maeil Ssamjang)  from the Asian grocery.  I think it really added to the flavor.

This is incredible.  I had to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire, but I'm sure it would have been even better if I had added it!  I served it over red rice with cheese stuffed sweet potato balls on the side.  SO good!  I think I might add a can of green chiles if I make it again, but they are definitely not necessary.

I have had ropa vieja several times in cuban restaurants and this was not as authentic as i thought. I cooked it in a pressure cooker.  There is a strong vinegar taste to the dish and the sauce is very thin.

We thought this recipe was excellent as written--we enjoyed it over rice. I thought a bit before adding the vinegar--it seemed like a lot--but was so glad I did! I don't think red wine would give the same flavor at all. The only thing I added initially was cumin and a garnish of fresh cilantro at the end, simply because we like it. I was glad to see the author's reply to all of the changes--if you want to publish your own recipe, please do, but I find it rude and unfair to totally overhaul someone else's recipe in the context of a review, and especially then to find fault with it.

I am a novice cook. The recipe was very easy; I followed it exactly but was disappointed with the end result. It was ok, but very bland compared to the Ropa Vieja I've eaten at Cuban restaraunts or cooked in home by Cubans.

very good recipe, maybe because I used a previously frozen roast there was a lot of liquid after 8 h. Also I would add the peppers in the last 1-2 h of cooking, mine turned into mush.

I grew up in Miami and have eaten Ropa Vieja from countless Cuban restaurants. I was EXTREMELY happy with how this turned out. I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception; I marinated the meat in mojo (a Cuban garlic based sauce) and small combination of black pepper, onion powder and powdered cumin the night before. I also threw in a bay leaf while it slow cooked. I served this to my family and everyone was absolutely ecstatic with how delicious it was. The final confirmation on how amazing it was was when my mom got seconds, and she hardly ever gets seconds on anything! I served it with black beans and rice to complete the meal. Simple, easy to make, makes a good amount of portions and delicious in every way!

Sounded good, so simply tried it out of the blue, and loved it.  It definitely is my style of food, which was great.  I did not modify it, besides reducing the size in half.  I would say if it needed anything, but it really did not.   I served it over white rice, like the picture, and it was perfect.  I loved that it turned out the very first time.  I will use this recipe as a staple!  Try it, you will enjoy it a lot!  I'm glad I found it.

Fantastic recipe. I followed it to the letter (because I don't cook) and it was fantastic.  This and Picadillo are my 2 favorite Cuban foods so I feel as though I know what its supposed to taste like and it was even better. 

Ill be making this again in the future.

I generally don't try out a recipe when I have company coming but it was last minute and this was the only thing I already had all the ingredients for that could feed all of us. It was ah-mazing!!! I always try to follow the recipe as closely as possible with a few tweaks based on other reviews the first time I make it. I only made minor variations: I used 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper in addition to the 2 green, I did the tomato paste but also added half a can of diced tomatoes (I'll probably use the whole can next time just because), I chopped about 6 cloves of garlic because well, garlic is my everything, the meat I used wasn't the chuck roast but a less expensive 2.3lb roast that was labeled as 'pot roast' at the store. I shredded it about 45 min before serving so it could bathe in all the deliciousness. After tasting I also added about 1 tblsp of sugar, some extra salt, pepper, Adobo, and garlic powder and stirred it in to soak. I served it with black beans, yellow rice, and Cuban bread. We fed 3 adults, a teenager, and 2 pre-teen boys and still and enough leftover for my husband and I to have it again. This is totally going in my rotation and I'm not varying from this version I made.  It was THAT good!!!!

My husband Tony is Cuban and this is one of his favorite dishes. I was hesitant to cook it ever let alone in a crock pot. But the first bite he took his eyes widened and much to his surprise said it tasted just like in a restaurant!!!! High praise indeed!!!!!  I did follow the recipe but did not have to take the meat out.  It fell apart in the crockpot so it was ready to eat in about 8 hours.  I was completely surprised at how good it tasted.  I highly recommend this recipe and it will be added to my menu from now on!!!!! Thank you NC baking girl!!

Excellent, followed NC's recipe. Used wine added some more spices. The meat was falling apart and very, very tasty. Served it with Tortillas, pickled jalapeno's sour cream and coleslaw.

It was aiiiigght. It was tasty, but I thought it was very greasy and fatty.  I used beef chuck as of the recipe called for, and I thought that made it very greasy. I don't know if I would have used a better cut of meat if it would been less greasy...?
Like I said, it was tasty, but I just felt very guilty eating it.

It made the house smell amazing. I was so excited to try it, but once I did, I really didn't care for the red wine vinegar taste of it. It seemed like it over powered the meat. My husband on the other hand LOVED it and told me I shouldn't change a thing. Even my picky eater 13 yr old daughter enjoyed it. I paired it with yellow rice. And it took longer to cook then the recipe said it would. I'm sure I will cook it again one day for them, but no time soon.

This was a nice change from pot roast, and I'm glad to have another recipe for the slow cooker.  I followed the recipe very closely, only making one change:  half red wine vinegar and half red wine, because I ran out of vinegar, lol!  I recommend the full cooking time.  I forgot to start it, so I did half on high and half on low, and it didn't really get tender.  It was tasty, though, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers on a tortilla.  Thanks for posting.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except for using red wine vinegar instead of water and sprinkled entire bottom of crock pot with cayenne powder. This was amazing with just enough kick and plenty of sauce.... so flavorful- an all time favorite for now on!!! It couuldnt be anymore low maintenance either... give it a try and you will emphatically agree...

Fantastic!  I added some grill seasoning and a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes to mine.  We demolished it!

Super yummy.  Instead of the spices indicated, I used 1/2 pkg of taco mix.  I also added a can of tomatoes with chilies.  Family loved it.

yum!  I used a tri tip roast since that's what i had on hand, added some red wine to the mix and used only 1 of each type of bell pepper.  still tasted great, and the company was impressed by it.  love that it's  super easy!!

It's missing something. I never have any luck when I put peppers in a slow cooker. It was in the slow cooker for 7.5 hrs and my peppers turned to mush and skins. If I ever make again maybe 6.5hrs is plenty.

This was fantastic! Kind of had a sweet flavor to it that was really nice. I served in tortillas and topped with shredded cheese, sliced avocado and sour cream. There was a lot of excess juice that I drained off at the end. Really tasty!

This was delicious.  Couldn't find sweet onions, so I used two yellow onions.  Also used a whole tin (5.5 oz) of tomato paste.  Otherwise followed the recipe to a tee and will definitely make it again (and again, and again).  It is quite meaty, so I may add another onion and some more peppers next time but it was definitely great as is.

This was wonderful, I didn't change much just substituted a white onion for the sweet onion and added ¼ cup of brandy. This was so tender and tasty, I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was ok, but my husband LOVED it!  I only used 2 red peppers no green-my personal preference.  I also only used 1 onion (dh & dd are not fond of them)  I thought it smelled VERY "peppery", but I didn't think it tasted very peppery.  I used the whole can of paste- I hate having it sit in the fridge always seems to go to waste and it was fine.  I wish I had started it a little earlier then I did because I think my meat could have used about 10 hours of cooking time.  I have leftovers that I'm going to use tonight in tacos or burritos so it will be interesting to see what happens with the flavors.  This is certainly easy to do.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and flavorful. A word of advice for those who are not crazy about peppers- this dish tastes A LOT like peppers. Cut down some if you prefer, you will be ok. I added 5 fresh garlic cloves minced and 1 whole can of tomato paste (and I regretted doing that, 1/2 can is definitely better in my opinion)

Excellent recipe!! The only thing I added was 2 tablespoons of crushed red pepper to add a bit of spice. My family loves their spicy foods!! Served with some home made refried beans and spanish rice in tortilla shells. Great!!

This was my first time making Ropa vieja, so i was a little worried about how it would come out. I had nothing to worry about, because it was great! My husband raved about this dish. We had it over rice, and it was perfect. I only used 3 peppers and half a large onion since hubby doesn't really like them, and it was still yummy. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was the best. I put one pickled jalapeno in it for a little spice. There are just two in our household and we had it over rice and in a tortilla and my husband put it over scrambled eggs. I plan on making this a regular.

Pretty good, & definitely easy.  We (husband & I) decided there was something missing, but couldn't put our fingers on it.  My 14 month old loved it!
