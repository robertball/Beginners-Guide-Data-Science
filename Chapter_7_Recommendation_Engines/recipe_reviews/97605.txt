I made this dish as a side to pasta for my DH and I and we thought it was a good unique side dish, but that there was WAY too much soy sauce and not enough ginger.  I added some roasted garlic and almost double the amount of ginger; I also added a squeeze of honey (in addition to the brown sugar) for a bit of added sweetness and it was pretty good.  I will probably try this again, but will modify the recipe to suit our taste.

My first impression when I read this recipe was - "Interesting, but warm lettuce?" Well - I like to experiment so I tried it. Not awful, but it is still warm lettuce. Imagine the pieces of lettuce that fall off your fast food hamburger. Thanks what the texture is like.

What a change of pace! I made these exactly as stated but I added some black pepper and garlic. I made this for the first BBQ of the season and everyone was really suprised at how good they were! I used romaine hearts that come in a 3 pack. One of my friends said this would be really good as a bed for an asian stir fry.
