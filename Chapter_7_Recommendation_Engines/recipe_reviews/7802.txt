Cake was pretty dry, if I make it again, I will add buttermilk in place of the whole milk.

This is a good recipe.  Only problem I had was that it was still a bit runny in the center after the specified cooking time, though it still went very well with ice-cream.  When I make this again I might play round with the temp and cooking time and I'll probably leave out the cinnamon as I found that to be a bit much.  Otherwise this was a good recipe and really did go well with ice-cream.
