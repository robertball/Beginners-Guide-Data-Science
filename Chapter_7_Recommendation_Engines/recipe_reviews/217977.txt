A very nice, simple and somewhat different salad.  I didn’t care to add the basil pesto to the dressing, so I just cut up fresh basil, chiffonade style, and sprinkled it over the salad just before serving.  I used  “Our Favorite Balsamic Vinaigrette,” also from this site.

Perfect. I used basil pesto that I had in the freezer for the dressing, and fresh arugula out of my garden. The man doesn't love arugula, and really only likes to eat it if I mix the greens, BUT he liked this, and he loved the dressing. The fresh mozzarella and tomatoes were just perfect for this time of year. If my garden keeps producing, we will keep eating this for sure!

We liked this salad better than the traditional Caprese that uses only tomatoes basil and Mozzarella. 
The only change I had to make was  using a handful of torn fresh basil leaves for the basil paste. 
We will be making this one again soon.
