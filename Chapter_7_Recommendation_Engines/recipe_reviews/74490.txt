Made this for my 78 year old Father who was gonna burn down the house if he kept cooking his own meals. He didn't throw it across the room so I knew it was good. I used a bit more Cayenne than it called for because he likes spicy foods. I also tried a pinch of dried rosemary the second time.. was even better!
