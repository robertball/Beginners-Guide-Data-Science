This roast is BY FAR the most flavorful roast I've ever made and the sauce that comes from the broth is amazing. I also reserved about 1 cup of the broth, added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to it and cooked carrots in it. Best carrots I've ever had. Husband and 2 year old daughter also loved every bit of it. This goes very well with sweet potatoes sprinkled (heavily) with paprika, chili powder, and salt and sauted in coconut oil. If I could give the whole thing more stars I would. Thanks for sharing.

This is delicious! I made mine spicier with more chili powder and added more dry cilantro when serving though.

Deliciousness! Even got a compliment of, "This is the best spiciest dish you've ever made" from my husband who usually orders 4 stars. Only difference I made was using 3 dried chipotle chile peppers in place of the red chilies as that is what I had on hand. Definitely needs to be served with rice.

The spices were right on. Love the taste of this. Next time, I might shred the meat instead though as we ate this with chappati and the slices were difficult to deal with.

I liked it shredded and served over potatoes.  I am not a huge fan of these spices on meat, but the rest of my family enjoyed it.

I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of two whole tomatoes and tomato paste.  I also added 3 tbsp of better than boullion to the sauce, and I did not cook the meat in any water.

Depending on which cut of chuck roast you buy, this could come out as a very dry, fairly tough piece of  beef accompanied by a very aromatic, lovely sauce.  Well, that's what happened to my meal, anyway.  I think it would be better if the beef were cut in smaller chunks, coated in flour, and seared in some oil before slow cooking.  The spice mixture and gravy are delicious though.

Everyone I cooked this for thought it was better than the restaurants we go to (our level,anyway!). I did add a couple steps. The night before, I trimmed off the excess fat, made a rub of approximately equal parts black pepper, chili powder, and garam Masala, and let the chuck sit in the fridge overnight. Then I seared the meat on all edges before setting up the slow cooker. Served over rice. People thanked me.

Really tasty but I substituted the ketchup for more puree and doubled the chilies for a spicier meal. Thanks for sharing!
