This is one of those recipes you will use weekly. I’ve made it four times and loved it each time. I even used pickled okra and it was out of this world delicious. No slime at all!! Add hot pepper flakes, sriracha salt, or whatever spices you like. I even used bacon grease once. Just awesome! You can’t go wrong. Thank you for the recipe.

I cooked at 375 X 5 min, stirred then another 5 min at same temp.  Wanted more crispy boosted the heat up to 400 X 3 min.  Spices: garlic powder, soy, cayenne, smoked paprika, pepper and olive oil.  Loved it!  Would like more crispy so will start off at 400.

This is very good.  I did add some garlic powder just because we love garlic.  Next time I will try the temp at 370 as we like it a little crispier.  It will be a new regular side dish at our house.  We used to make this in the oven but much better in the air fryer.

Great alternative to frying or heating the oven (AND the kitchen) to roast!  I mixed pickled (rinsed) and fresh okra since I didn't have enough fresh.  Although the pickling would be tasted slightly, the dish was delicious!  I had to air fry longer and higher temperature than suggested.

With growing okra in the garden, we have made this over and over as a go to. Simple, quick and glad it was submitted. No changes to the original recipe.
