Hello Bakers! Recipe creator here! A great way to spice up this recipe is to add Rum Extract instead of Vanilla extract to the icing mixture, as well as a dusting of Nutmeg for an even closer Eggnog experience!

I loved the batter this recipe makes. It just feels right. I made this cake for my friend's birthday. I replaced half of the butter with applesauce, (I know that sounds random, but just hear me out) and then i baked it in two eight inch round pans. I then mixed a cup of peanut butter woth a cup of powdered sugar to make a firm and sweet peanut butter filling, because bananas and peanut butter are bomb together. The moisture and density was brilliant and the flavor was THE tits. I love this cake recipe! Next time i might see if i can replace all the butter with applesauce rather than half to get a slightly more dense cake, but that might effect the banana-nog flavor of the cake. I would add a photo of it, but i frosted some foul language in cursive on the cake because i knew my friend would like that.

Made this cake tonight. I am a novice cook and followed the directions exactly as written. The cake was done in one hour and came out perfectly. The house smells as delicious as this cake tastes!

I was looking for a recipe to use up the after Christmas eggnog and came across this one.  Boy, this exceeded our expectations!  It was moist and landed an amazing flavor from the eggnog.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this for the first time today, and this is my new favorite cake!! Of course I made some changes...but nothing major. I didn't have any eggnog so I had to make my own. I added spiced rum to the eggnog. I also had four bananas that I needed to get rid of, so I probably put closer to 2 cups of banana. For the frosting, I did not have any powdered sugar, so I made my own frosting with 1/3c. butter, 3/4c. brown sugar, 8 oz. cream cheese, a splash of rum and some almond extract. The finished product was a dense, moist, rich cake with great flavors (sweetness, banana, spice, cream)and a very light, whipped frosting...this was absolutely AMAZING!

I made this cake exactly as written. Bake at 275 degrees for one hour. At the end of the hour it was not close to being done, so I turned the oven up to 325 and baked another 8 minutes.  Each oven is different, so maybe your oven will bake it as written. For taste alone, I would have given it 5 stars!  I could not even wait for it to be frosted!  It was moist and so very good. I would use a butter cream frosting instead of cream cheese frosting, but that is personal preference.  This is a keeper!

I rated this five stars because it was so easy and tasty. I was searching for a recipe to utilize our leftover holiday eggnog, and found this. My six year old and I made this cake and brought it to a new year party. The reviews were all positive. It needed more than an hour at 325 though. I gave it another ten minutes. The best part was getting everyone to guess the mystery ingredient!

Just like most reviewers, I was happy to find a way to use up my eggnog, the flavor of which was not very discernible. The cake was like a very sweet banana bread. It puffed up a lot in the oven and the center was moist while the edges were dryer. The icing was the best part, I used just shy of the three cups sugar that was called for and I could almost eat it by itself. I  took it to a potluck and people said they liked it, especially the icing, but there was more left at the end than the other desserts I usually take.

I made the cake part of this recipe for a party tonight!  It was a huge success - many compliments.  I used a storebought cream cheese frosting instead of the one described here, though.

I took the recommendation of using rum flavor instead of vanilla and adding nutmeg which took the frosting to the next level. Everyone loved the cake and commented on the moistness. This is a keeper.

This is one of the most delicious cakes I’ve ever made. I did everything the instructions said but one thing. Instead of using 3/4 cup of Margarine I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 of applesauce. It makes a lot of batter so I made a bundt cake and two small loafs. I put it all in the oven at 325 degrees for exactly 1 hour and it came out perfect. This is definitely a keeper. Oh, one more thing I forgot, I added some real rum because I didn’t have flavoring it was the finishing touch!

The cake was delicious. Hardly a hint of eggnog. I'd probably add more nog or maybe even rum flavoring. But it was moist and delicious. Pretty good without the frosting even.

I made this but did not frost it and called it "bread." I used store bought alcoholic eggnog and black bananas.It is a really well balanced, egg noggy and banana-ish recipe. A new favorite!

I tried to make a less "guilt provoking" version.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda, instead of the white sugar, I used 2 cups of brown sugar ( I think I could probably get away with 1 1/2 cups next time) and I added 1 tablespoon of canola oil, a dash of rum and nutmeg.  I didn't do the frosting.  It turned out great!  Very tasty and moist.  More of a banana flavor than an eggnog flavor but oh so good!!

Since egg nog and bananas are already sweet, I didn't think the recipe needed too much sugar and I was right (well, for my taste buds). I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and added dark chocolate chips because I was having a chocolate craving. It was sweet enough. I can't imagine putting anymore sugar in there as the recipe asks for. I also tried to make a cream cheese frosting that is a bit healthier. I used a package of cream cheese 1/4 of a stick of butter, I added the brandy as suggested and sweetened it with pure maple syrup to taste and it was sweet enough. Hit the spot.

I made the cake exactly as directed, although without the icing. Delicious! And I loved being able to use up the remaining eggnog. I had everything else in the house. Yum!
