A great weekend breakfast/brunch recipe. I do not have an ovenproof skillet, so what I did was saute the sliced apples, sugar, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg, then poured the mixture into a prepared 10" glass pie pan. I then poured the pancake mixture on top. Baked as noted in the recipe. The result delicious--and vanished quickly!

This was delicious. I did cut the butter and sugar in half, as I often do in recipes, and it turned out great. I also doubled the apples, which seems like too many when you put them in the pan but they bake down quite a bit.  
For all of you complaining that it is too eggy...you would think the fact that it has 4 eggs and only a half cup of flour would tip you off? Yes, it is eggy and that is why many of us love it. Don't give a poor rating because something that is SUPPOSED to be eggy IS!

I've made this twice, and both times resulted in superb breakfasts!  I doubled the apples, and halved the butter in the pan (not the batter) which improved the health factor and actually tasted better too.  Wow.  We used to go to a restaurant to get this particular dish, but now my family exclaims that this recipe is even better!  Thank you!!!

I am a kid so it does very well on Kid Friendly.  I did this for Mothers Day because my Mom lived in Indionapolis Indiana where they have the original pancake house with apple pancakes, and she thought that she couldn't get them anywhere else.  Ta-daa!
Thanks allrecipies!

Made for a very interesting flavour that I've never tried before! We didn't have the right size of skillet, so transferred everything to a pie dish for the baking. It rose so much that it spat some apples and butter into the oven! Oops, use a higher rim next time.

I recommend using 2 apples instead of 1! We used 2 apples, and it still didn't seem like enough!

Everything else worked out perfect. It had just the right sweetness, and the texture and flavour was fun and interesting. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a fabulous oven pancake suitable for guest presentation!  I am going to make it for Christmas morning.  My family loved it!  Please note:  This is not a cakey recipe like a stove top pancake.  The batter has a thicker crepe-like consistency.  If you have ever had Dutch Pannekoken you will probably like this.  Be sure to add all the sugar (it won't need any syrup, just whipped crea and a dust of cinnamon), increase the cinnamon in the recipe as suggested by others.  I used tart apples from our own tree (about 3 cups sliced) and cooked them in the sugar mix for about 2 mins on the stovetop.  I only let the batter sit about 10 mins and everything rose beautifully.  If your pancake does not perform as expected, check the expiration date of the baking powder - if you don't bake a lot and use it up consistently it can expire and not work as expected.  Also be sure to use baking powder not baking soda! (LOL) I suspect that these might be the reason some did not get their pancake to rise.

YUM!! I've tried this with fresh apples, and with apple pie filling, tastes much better with fresh. Definitely worth the little extra time it takes to make it with fresh apples!

Made this tonight for a breakfast/supper, & it came out super!  All 4 kids and husband loved it.  I did it in 2 saute pans, and doubled the recipe, it worked perfectly.  I omitted the nutmeg by accident and it was still fantastic.  If anybody from the NorthEast remembers going to Bickford's for the "Big Apple" this recipe is a ringer.. The only thing that would have made it more authentic would be to have it served up at 2AM by a surly waitress that reaked of cigarette smoke.

This recipe was very good!  If you like custard and apples this recipe is a must try.  Anyone who is looking for a recipe similar to Walker Brothers Rest., this is NOT the same, but very good.  Another reviewer recommend the recipe from Cooks, but this one is far Better!!!!  I followed suggestion of using 2-3 apples(which is a must) and used 1 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, my husband does not like nutmeg.  If you are preparing this recipe with Granny Smith Apples, the amount of sugar is perfect or TBS less, it gave the pancake the nice crust.  Some reviewers suggest reducing sugar, I would only do this if you using a sweeter apple(see note below).  The butter could be cut by 3 TBS but I used the 1/4 cup(4 TBS) because my cast iron skillet was recently seasoned.  I am giving this a 4 1/2 stars.  I would definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!  *A mix of sweeter/tart apples are Jonathan, Stayman-Winesap, Cox's Orange Pippin, and Jonagold.  *Sweet Apples are Braeburn, Fuji, Mutsu, Pink Lady, Suncrisp, Rome Beauty and Empire.  I would definitely use less sugar with these apples, but go with the Granny Smith, you would probably would use little less butter as well.  My Suggestion, go with 2 Granny Smith apples.

We just tried this today and we were all very pleased with the result.
 However, we made a double recipe and used six eggs rather than eight. We also cut out the nut-meg and reduced the sugar.

This is VERY GOOD and we will be making it again. (Soon, I hope!)

Very good, easy recipe.  My family liked it very much.  I did add extra cinammon as suggested, about 1  1/4 teaspoon.  I didn't have time to let the batter sit overnight or for a few hours.  It sat for about 10 minutes and turned out fine. I found it easier to remove the pancake from the baking pan by placing a serving dish on top of it and turning it upside down.  Thought it looked quite nice that way too.

I have been eating these from the Original House of Pancakes since I was a kid.  This recipe is almost a spot on match. I did make some changes in the Cinnamon Sugar topping.   3.5 tablespoons dark brown sugar,  2 tablespoons white sugar,  2 1/4 teaspoons Saigon Cinnamon (Makes a huge difference),  1/4 teaspoon  cornstarch,  3 tablespoons  butter. Combine sugars, cinnamon and cornstarch. Sift breaking up any large lumps.  Melt butter in pan, add sugar mixture to butter in pan and mix to combine. Spread mixture on the bottom of the pan. Continue with recipe as directed. Enjoy

great german apple pancake! I used splenda and egg whites and it turned out so tasty. I'll definitely be making this again. My version has under 150 calories and 8 servings.

*** update:  I tried it with the healthy suggestions ( like cutting the butter in half) and it was just okay.  I recommend making this recipe as-is --->  Amazing.  I added 1 tsp of salt but otherwise did not change the recipe.  My husband I both raved about this and it will definitely be a staple.  I didn't have an oven-proof skillet so I melted the butter in a saucepan and added the apples to the mixture, boiling about 5 minutes until the apples were a little cooked.  Then I transferred that to the bottom of a glass pie dish, added the 1/4 sugar, and poured the batter over all of it.  Delicious.

I make this recipe with some small modifications all the time and it's one of my family's favorite breakfasts/brunches. Today, I decided to try it with all wheat flour, and it was DELICIOUS that way!! I always add the original amount of butter to the batter, but when it comes to the second amount of butter for the pan, I always use just enough to grease it and no more. 1/4 cup is way too much. I also cut down a lot on the sugar. Instead of 1/2 cup divided, I just add the apples to the skillet with butter and then just sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of the sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mixture over the apples and that is the perfect amount for my family. I could never imagine adding a whole half cup! I recommend just eyeballing how much you think you would like. Try it with wheat flour! It's the only way I will make mine from now on!

I saw this on the recipe buzz yesterday and just had to try it. I like anything with apples and have always liked German food. I I used whipped butter, because it was what I had on hand. After it was baked the taste was like a cinnamon and buttery soft apple pancake with a slight custardy center. I thought it made more like 6 servings though, and liked that it all fit in one pan and looked like a fancy breakfast dish. Plus, I got an excuse to use my cast iron pan, which I hadn't used in awhile. Thank you submitter.

Mollie I love your recipe!  I made it first following you directions exactly which we all loved, but the next time I made it I used my large muffin tin instead and made 6 small pancakes - also very good.  I did adjust the baking time to 8 min at 425 and about 8 -10 min at 375 and I did use a little more apples.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This pancake is delicious!! I followed some reviewers advice and used less eggs (only 2), reduced the butter to 1 Tsp for the batter and 2 Tsp for the skillet. I also reduced the sugar to 3 Tsp for the skillet + topping and still this fluffy concoction was wonderful. 
I fried the apple slices in the butter on the stoven, sprinked part of the sugar cinnamon mix over them, then spread the batter and baked it. It turned out very fluffy. 
After baking I spread the rest of cinnamon and sugar and I sprinkled it with lemon juice. Hmmmm!! My husband loved it as well.
Thank you for the recipes!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it had super good flavor, however I am a texture person and couldn't eat this due to the texture. It was like a bread pudding. I would never give a bad rating on my oddities but thought that someone should mention the texture of this recipe.

I've made this dozens of times. I even spice it up with different fruit (apples, peaches, strawberries, blueberries, even mixed fruit) sometimes and my family of 8 love every one.  I double the recipe due to my large family and it's barely enough.  I occasionally switch sugar to brown sugar but not always.  It's fantastic with no changes at all.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Excellent. Be careful when cooking the apples, this is carmel and it will go from syrupy to crispy pretty fast. I will be making this often. TFS

Very good. Be careful NOT to boil the sugar/butter mixture--or to JUST barely let it boil. Otherwise it will harden to the candy stage and when it comes out of the oven, the carmel will be brittle vs. a sauce that flows like a syrup.

We had this at the Original House of Pancakes and have tried to make it at home with mixed results using our Dutch Baby recipe and adding the apple/sugar mixture in. This answered a big question why ours was good but not perfect. This is perfect. Really didn't change anything, it is a fantastic recipe and a delicious dish. Highly recommend this one. We do Turn the pan over onto a serving place so the presentation is amazing with all the stickygoowy sugar and beautifly backed apples on top. Similar to the picture. Ours in the pan is all pancake on top and you don't see the apples until turned over. Ours rose very nicely. If it doesn't rise for you either don't mix it so much if you can't allow the batter to stand for an hour or 2. I prefer to mix the night before so all I need to do is work on the apples in the morning. I let the batter come to room temp while working on the apples. Two apples are better than one. I have a 12 inch cast iron skillet so I double the batter as well to serve more. A lot of work to make a second batch with the cleaning of the pan.

Awesome! The whole family loved this! I also doubled the apples. I just got a convection oven so I adjusted the temp to 375 for 13 mins then 350 for 10 and it was great!

Easy and delicious! I lightened this recipe by replacing eggs with Egg Beaters; milk with skim milk; sugar with Splenda; and, butter with fat free margarine. Since I prefer sweet foods, I used a red delicious apple. Great dish!!!

Really good! We had this for breakfast this morning and really enjoyed it.  I followed the suggestions to add more apple (I used about 1 3/4 Granny Smith apples) and to add a bit more cinnamon.  The only change I will make when we have this next will be to halve the nutmeg - it was a little strong for our tastes.

Awesome recipe, I have been making it for years and am just getting around to reviewing-opps ;) I always have to make this recipe X2 for my family, they love it!! I use no nutmeg, more cinnamon in the apples and add a little to the batter, and reduce the eggs to 6 or 7 for a double batch depending on the size of my eggs(we use farm fresh eggs), I also use salted butter and omit the salt. Great weekend breakfast. My son has to have some put up for lunch, he loves it THAT much!!  Tip: to get the apples to stay on the bottom of the pan, let them sit for 30min to an hour after cooking(I cook the apples, make the batter, wait 30 minutes and put the batter in and bake)

Seriously delicious and very simple.  If you're tired of making regular, boring, American pancakes...then you have to try these.....even if you don't have maple syrup a little powdered sugar on the finished product is all you need.....highly recommended....I always make these for family get-togethers....everyone thinks I'm a master chef but little do they know how easy they are!!!

This is absolutely wonderful. Just made it for my husband for Father's Day. . Easy and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, except used my Pamper Chef deep dish pie plate. Melted butter in oven in pie dish, placed sugar mixture and apples in dish heated in oven until bubbly, then added batter and baked according to directions...Perfect. Will make again.

I thought this was very tasty and my toddler gobbled it up!  Here are the tweaks I made or would make in the future:
- cut the butter in half, it felt like it was way too much butter
- I don't have an ovenproof pan at that temp, so I used a pie pan, which worked out perfectly.  In the future I'd saute the apples in the butter/sugar for 10 min or so before baking because even extending the baking time they were a bit crunchy
- I don't know if it is because I live in high altitude but once I reduced the temperature, I wound up needing to bake an extra 10-15 minutes
- I used two medium sized Gala apples, and in the future I would probably use three
- I cut the nutmeg/cinnamon ratio.  I doubled the sugar to go with more apples along with the cinnamon but only kept a bit of nutmeg - that is just personal preference.

All-in-all this was fantastic!

Delicious. Wish I'd read the reviews first, I would have added a 2nd apple! I'm not a fan of nutmeg but I cut it in half and liked it at that level.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations.  After reading some reviews I was worried it would be too custardy.  I added 1/4 cup extra flour to the batter.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and double sugar to the batter.  I omitted the nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon in the apples.  I baked in a 10 inch skillet and had to add 10 minutes longer at 375 because it was still liquid in the center.  The end result came out delicious.  The family actually liked it too, which is unusual :)

Oh my gosh, this was great. I used 2 apples (personal preference) and the rest of the recipe was followed exactly. My son and his girlfriend are here for Christmas break and I thought this was a good opportunity to try this and they loved it as well. This is, without a doubt, a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.

Perfect made exactly as the recipe calls for. The first time I made it was a true winner, and then the second time I made it, I tried some of the suggestions in the reviews-big mistake! Additional cinnamon is overpowering and knocks out the delicate nutmeg flavor in this recipe, and decreasing the butter simply doesn't work. I also prefered 1 apple instead of 2, as 2 seemed to make it soggy. I went to a thrift shop and purchased a $5 cast iron skillet for this recipe, and it was so worth it! And it came already seasoned! What a bargain.

Yum!  I have made this for brunch the last two weekends.  I followed the suggestions to use a pie plate to bake and to use 2 apples and less butter in the pan.  I also used more cinnamon and nutmeg, in addition to sprinkling over the sugar in the bottom of the pan, I stirred in cinnamon and nutmeg with the sliced apples.  Very yummy!

This was incredible!!  The presentation was beautiful and it tasted amazing.  The outer edges were crispy and reminiscent of the "elephant ears" my parents bought me at the Iowa State fairs when I was younger and the middle was softer and just plain wonderful.  I took the advice in the write-up and mixed the batter together the night before.

Terrific recipe, easy to make. We used to get something like this at a restaurant chain, but my husband says mine is better, lighter.  Make sure you get the butter up the sides.

I really liked it, kids did too.  It reminded me of the custard pies my Mom made as a kid (with the addition of apples)  Not too sweet and very good.  I used two apples and reduced the nutmeg.  If you don't like custard pie then you probably won't like this.  My husband doesn't care for custard so this wasn't his favorite.

This is one of our favorite breakfast recipes and I have been making it for several years. 

The recipe works really well with other fruits such as pears (or a mix of apples and pears) and peaches. 

I make this in my cast iron skillet. Although the recipe is great as-is, I have been making the following modifications to suit our taste: I usually add more fruits than called for (2 apples at least, sometimes 3) and I decrease the sugar to about 1/4 cup. I also put only 3 tbsp of butter in the pan to cook the apples to cut on the calories slightly. 

But even without these changes, this recipe is a winner! Highly recommend.

This was very good, very like an apple custard. I made this for christmas brunch and there wasn't any left. I did adjust the recipe as follows: doubled the apples, halved the nutmeg.

I tried this instead of my usual Cook's Illustrated German Apple Pancake.  I should have stuck with Cook's!  This has way too much egg and is very "meh".  I highly suggest the Cook's Illustrated one!

This tasted good but was a bit of a disaster.  It didn't look done so I baked it another 5-8 minutes.  Removed from oven and tried to slide on a plate.  It still wasn't cooked and fell apart completly.  I scooped it all back into the pan, baked another 8 minutes or so and served it in bowl.  It sort of reminded be of bread pudding.  I might try it again but I'll use a larger pan and let it cool longer before trying to move it to a plate.

What an awesome way to start the day. I would give this 5 stars, but my wife wasn't so thrilled. Following the directions exactly (except adding one additional apple) the batter portion was slightly underdone. This is what turned my wife off, but I still loved it. Next time I'll probably add 5 minutes cooking time to compensate for my oven, but my wife didn't like how eggy it was (which is exactly why I loved it). Great recipe!

I thought this was delicious, but it wasn't my husband's favorite. It was kind of custard-like, somewhat eggy, which I loved but he didn't. I wasn't paying attention to the first part of the directions, but I would mix the dry ingredients before adding eggs, milk, etc. I also used two granny smith apples and would add even more. I also halved the butter for the dutch pan. My dutch skillet is 12" so it was a little bit flatter, but it turned out pretty well.

This was very tasty. I'm dairy free, so I made it with coconut milk and earth balance spread. It definitely doesn't need all of the sugar called for; I used less and it was plenty sweet. My 2.5 year old daughters just gobbled this up like there was no tomorrow, so I will definitely be making it again.

Very tasty and a special treat. Next time, I may cook it an additional five minutes at the lower temperature to get a bit firmer set in the middle.

I was so disappointed in this recipe!  This was much eggier than I was expecting.  Calling this a pancake seems like a bit of a misnomer.    About halfway through the cooking time, I took a peek at it and noticed how eggy it looked.    I decided then to read through some of the reviews and that's when I realized that this is actually SUPPOSED to be an eggy/custardy sort of dish, not a cakey one.   Darnit!   I'll keep looking for a good skillet pancake recipe...

3 eggs, 2/3 cup of milk, and no sugar or butter in batter.

3 TBSP butter in pan, cut sugar in half for sprinkling over butter and sprinkling over apples

Use 2 apples

I didn't have milk so I used heavy whipping cream...more fat is always good! I also wanted it thicker so I used a oven safe pot instead of a saucepan. I also had 4 small granny smith apples then I needed to use. I let the batter sit overnight in the fridge and then promptly spilled half of it. :-( I added more whipping cream and it still turned  out amazing!

Delicious! Some changes that worked for me include substituting light brown sugar for the white sugar, using apple pie spice in place of all the spices, and tossing the apple slices with 1 tbs of whiskey. These changes give this dish a more complex flavor. I used two medium apples instead of the 1 large, and did not add any additional sugar over the top of the fritter, choosing instead to drizzle with agave-maple syrup when done. Also, I didn't have a deep oven-proof skillet so I used a regular one and used most but not all of the batter. BTW, give the batter a quick whisk before you pour it into the skillet so it's uniform. The batter should sit below the rim of the skillet before you put it into the oven as it will rise. I also cooked the fritter at the lower temp for a total of 20 minutes and it turned out fine. The key is that the fritter should be dry to the touch, which means it's done.

This was one of the most disgusting things I have ever tried to eat.

I expected at least a pancake texture to this thing. However with 4 eggs (!!!!!!!!) and just a tiny bit of milk and flour this thing is just a sweet oven cooked omelette with caramelized apples on top. 

Ever wonder why that is not an usual topping for omelettes? I'll tell you why, because they don't match.

The worst part is it was a complete waste of the last apples I got apple picking with my dad. Maybe I'll dig them out of this disgusting concoction and use them to top regular pancakes.

I just made this today, and I thought it was awesome! I used a Lodge iron skillet, and the edges were crisp, and the middle was very soft and creamy, like a baked french toast. I grated fresh nutmeg, and would highly recommend that! I did not have a tart apple, so I used another variety. I think a granny smith would have been better, as a nice tart contrast to the sweet apple-goo made by the sugar and spices. This was delicious, and a definite keeper. It looks so impressive at the table!

I was very disappionted with this recipe. The pancake part was way too eggy and a weird texture and the apples floated to the top and didn't cook.  The cook time I found was also too long because the edges were close to burnt.  I followed the instructions exactly and cant think I did anything incorrectly.

Brings back childhood memories of going to "The Original Pancake House" in Southfield MI and having to stand in a long line every Sunday morning after church.  My parents always requested a table as close to the fireplace as possible (which usaully meant an additional 20 minute wait).  Well worth the wait when our German Apple Pancakes came to the table steaming and waiting to be devoured.  This recipe does not dissapoint, although may have carmelized better had I made it in a preheated cast iron skillet (used glass pie plate, turned out well, but lacking authentic rustic feel of finished product.)

I made this for breakfast this morning and whlie hubs and I loved it, the kids were a bit indifferent. It was very easy to throw together and although I thought the 1/2 cup of sugar would be too much, it wasn't. We will definitely make this again (and make 'toaster pancakes' for the kids!)

This recipe is straight out of the Bon Appetit 'Breakfasts and Brunches' cookbook...word for word. Anyway, I used all 4 eggs but think I'd cut back to 3, maybe even 2 next time. I also doubled the apples like many other people here. It was enjoyable enough, but I'm not sure I'd bother making it again.

this pancake was very tasty, but I found it a little too sweet and buttery. Next time I will halve the sugar and butter in the batter, I used 2 tbsps melted butter, 2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 apples in topping was very good we did not need syrup.
If your pan is not ovenproof cover the handle with foil.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing that I did differently is I used cake and pastry flour instead of all purpose.  (Added 1 extra tbsp).  I also doubled the cinnamon, and cut back on the butter and sugar by about 1/3.  After coming out of the oven, delicious with some powdered sugar on top.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I cut back alittle on sugar and butter and also added  1 cup fresh blueberries along with the apple (fresh cherries would also work).  It was very good.  Served with alittle maple syrup. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I have made German pancakes before and was expecting this to be a jazzed-up version, but after it came out of the oven it was really greasy and the texture was more like a watery omelet like others have said rather than the more firm texture of the German pancakes I am used to.  I will not try this again!  If anything, I will sauté my own apples and serve them on top of my regular German pancake recipe.

I was looking for a skillet type of apple pancake that was about an inch or more in height -- very disappointed!  This turned out to be "flat as a pancake".  Also, way too much nutmeg.

I tried this recipe without knowing very much about what exactly my product would be. It was more of an apple custard than a pancake. I really enjoyed it. The apples are delicious! The perfect mix of sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg! My husband however did not like the eggy texture with the tastes of the apples and cinnamon. All in all, very tastey and I will make it again.

This is amazing! I like so many other reviewers have been trying to figure out how to this since I first experienced it's deliciousness at the Original Pancake House. This is the closest I have come. Awesome!! I halved the nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon, just the way we like it in our house. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I recommend a cast iron pan for cooking. Tried it in a stainless steel pan, it didn't come out nearly as well as the one in my cast iron.

I used two apples instead of one (I would definitely recommend this) and it turned out great! It tasted delicious cold, too.

Over the years we have visited a local restaurant with the kids for this family favorite, but now I make it myself.  It is by far the closest recipe to our favorite.  The pancake is fluffy and eggy, but that's the way it's suppose to be... souffle.

This was absolutely wonderful!!! I did change the recipe slightly. Since I was trying to get rid of eggs, I used 6 eggs instead of 4 (this worked well). I also subbed brown sugar with the apples instead of white. I think next time I will decrease the sugar and butter in the recipe. . .perhaps 2T butter and just 1/4 c brown sugar in the apple mixture.

I didn't really know what to expect, but it turned out to be DELICIOUS. It's like eating hot apple custard. I did everything just as written but doubled the cinnamon and the apples. I had some the next day too and still delicious!! Mine looks *exactly* like LESLEYfromWI's photo, too, edges and all. Keeping this recipe for a lonnnnng time.

Really delicious.  Great recipe.  Thanks.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves to the batter.  I used 2 tart apples and sauted them with butter and cinnamon and sugar.  I uses a pie plate to bake and server and added brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg to the pie plate bottom before layering on the apples.  We loved it.

Came out great. I used 1 extra apple, and cooked the apple mixtre on the stove top for a couple of minutes. I do not have a cast iron skillet, so I used the pampered Chef deep dish baker. I heated the baker in the oven first, poured the aplle mixture in the hot baker and then the egg mixtre, and baked it the recommended time and it came out great! Thanks for sharing!

This is very similar to the house special I had at the "Original Pancake House" in Portland, Oregon. Easy to make, I did cut back on the nutmeg cause I'm not a great fan.

I made this exactly as the recipe called, no alterations. It has the texture of custard, so if you don't like custard, you probably won't like this.  The nutmeg was a little strong for me and my husband, but all in all, it was good.  I might make it for a special occasion, but just for breakfast we will stick to regular pancakes.

This was astoundingly delicious!
I only had three eggs, so I used a 1/4 cup of apple sauce in the place of the one egg.  I am a health freak, so I used whole wheat flour instead of regular and olive oil in the batter instead of butter.  I also used evaporated cane juice in the place of white sugar.
For the apples I used 3 extra and mixed them with evaporated cane juice and spice in a bowl and just stir fried them in a little olive oil, then transferred them to a baking dish.

I added double spice as well.

This was a really good recipe. I will make it again and again.

I thought this recipe had good flavor with the apples and the spices, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that the egg mixture was just kinda weird.  It almost didn't seem done, even though I kept it in the oven longer than stated in the recipe.  It just had a very weird texture to it.  If I made this again, I would use my own oven pancake recipe but use the apples and spices as stated.

Way too much nutmeg. That was all I could taste. I thought it was an odd amount, but followed the recipe anyway. I think if I used 1/8 teaspoon instead it would have been much better.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time.  My Swiss grandfather was a chef and would make this for us whenever we would visit.  I've been looking for this recipe for years.  I'm so glad I found it.  Most times I cut this in half (except for the apples) and cook it in a smaller pan.  I've also made it with oil in the batter instead of the melted butter.

I tried to make this without pre-cooking before the oven.... did not work. It came out more like an apple custard, despite cooking for much longer than suggested.

The only thing we liked was the apples.  The pancake came out rubbery.  I have had this type of pancake before and enjoyed it.  Perhaps I did something wrong but I will not make this particular recipe again.  Also I think it is too sweet.  I would cut the sugar in the apple mixture.

This was quite good.  I took the advise of others and sauted the apples in the butter, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and the put it in a pie dish to bake it.  It baked beautifully and was not at all runny.  Just great!

I wanted to try this recipe before Mother's Day.  So last night I made it for my husband and it was delicious and so easy!  It reminds me more of french toast than a pancake.  I couldn't get it to slide out of the pan, so I cut it into wedges and used a pie server to serve it.  I also only sprinkled 2 Tbsp. of sugar over the apples, not a 1/4 cup.  I'm looking forward to serving it next weekend for Mother's Day.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since moving to Western PA, I've eaten many German apple pancakes, and tried several recipes, but this is the best!!  Lots of flavor from the spice.  I used fresh Northern Spy apples.  My kids loves it. Thanks for the great recipe.
PS To the cook that complained that it puffed and then fell and was too eggy--that's what it is suppose to do!!  This has a creamy, custardy center, it is not a cake!

This recipe is AMAZING!  My husband requests it quite often, and he loves it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!  I'm disappointed with the other ratings where people complain that the recipe wasn't that good with apple pie filling.  The recipe never said to use that.  I've used numerous types of apples (whatever's on hand), but the best is definitely with Granny Smiths! MMMMmm  goood!

A huge disappointment. Butter and apples floated up when pouring the batter carefully. The batter rose in the oven and fell when taken out of the oven. The final product has a heavy egg flavor. I'd look for an apple upsidedown cake recipe next time and just use less batter for a pancake effect.

This is very good, it is quite easy to make, it looks very nice and it taste delicious.  My husband loved it.  Using an apple instead of apple pie filling is the best way to make this recipe.  Enjoy.

So good! The only thing I changed was to add another sliced apple, and I baked in a 12 inch cast iron rather then 10 inch. I served with yogurt and the entire family loved it!

This recipe is awesome  :) I was craving the German apple pancake and my husband and I usually order it at the "pantry" the taste is amazing however I made it with whole wheat flour cause that's what I had on hand and the taste was good but abviously looked like it was burned but it wasn't. I will definitely make it next time with white all purpose flour 
How do I get the corners of the pancake to rise beyond the apples?

Awesome. Easy to make. I used a 12-inch cast iron skillet, and it nearly overflowed. I used 3 small Granny Smith apples.

Tried this and it was yummy. I used two apples instead of one and increase second half of baking time to 20 minutes. The recipe was a bit hard to follow; should have been more specific as to dividing butter and sugar.

To achieve the effect in my photo, you must use a 10-inch skillet instead of the 12-inch. Great recipe, taste like the holidays!

We cut the sugar and butter in half as others suggested (the part that goes into the pan not the batter) and used bananas (we had no apples).  It was really good and extremely easy to make in my cast iron pan.

I made this following the directions as best I could - I only had 3 eggs and 1 sweet apple. I used 100% white whole wheat flour and much less butter in the apple mixture (used some coconut oil). The recipe was really good. The 3 eggs were fine, but I think a Granny Smith apple would balance out the flavors better and next time I'll add 2 apples.

This recipe was super delicious.  I didn't let it sit over night, I just let it sit while I was peeling and cutting apples and it worked great. I made it exactly as suggested except I doubled the apples. Also, I am not classy enough to have a pan that goes in the oven so I just dumped it in a pie pan & it worked really well. My only suggestion would be use a BIG pie pan because your apples might fall off while it's puffing up if you double the apples like I did. Either way, it was still really easy to make and super yummy. The most tedious part was just peeling the apples. I hate peeling apples and I still think this recipe was worth it so that's saying something! I will be making this again!

This was delicious.  I made only two changes to the ingredients themselves:  I used 3 1/2 apples, peeled & sliced, instead of just the 1, and I used 1/4 cup vanilla/sugar in place of the regular sugar when sprinkling on the apples.  I have a real "argument" with the number of people this is supposed to serve.  Really - 4 people???  My husband & I polished this off for supper - just the two of us.  But I guess that says more about my husband & me than it does about the recipe.

Again - wonderful recipe!  Delicious & perfect!

We make this a few times each September after our apple picking trip. Awesome breakfast. We do cut the sugar down but that is our only tweak. Well we don't necessarily let the batter sit for 30 minutes either but it still comes out quite tasty!!

The directions need to be rewritten to identify the butter options better.  I found it is a bit better with about 2 more tablespoons of butter.

My husband calls this "Apple Pie Pancake."  We both liked this a lot!  I followed another reviewers advice and sautéed the sliced apples, sugar, butter, cinnamon & nutmeg, then poured the mixture into a 9" glass pie dish.  Then I poured the pancake mixture on top and baked as noted.  I used 2 apples, and next time, I will halve the butter in the pan.  And yes, there will be a next time!

I made this exactly as written except that I doubled the apple and accidentally left out the 1/4 cup sugar at the end, but I think it would have been too sweet with it.  If you're using large eggs I suggest using 3 instead of 4 and I will be halving the butter in the pan and sauteeing the apples, just coating them in the butter and spice mixture to keep them a little firmer.  I also have found in other recipes that it's a good idea to warm up milk slightly before mixing melted butter in.  It was very yummy and my family loved it the first time, but I'll keep tweaking until it's perfect.

I was looking for something different to make for breakfast on a cold and snowy day, I'm so happy I tried this recipe it was really simple to make and yummy.  I followed the directions exactly with the only exception being I added some chopped pecans on top of the apples.

Loved it! My husband and I cut back a tablespoon on butter for the pan and reduced sugar to 1/3 cup. Added a second apple (to finish up what I had t the house) and this was a true weekend breakfast treat. Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe but used only 6 eggs (per other reviewers) and added 6 apples as mine were small. I cooked the apples on the stove with the butter, sugar and cinnamon (doubled that), then poured into a big pyrex dish. I didn't wait 30 minutes to pour the batter on top and I added pumpkin pie spice to the batter versus nutmeg. I cooked it per the recipe and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Everyone loved it!

This was perfect, I even increased the recipe by 1.5 to compensate for larger skillet. Very similar to kaiserschmarn only in Germany they add fruit on top after cooking the pancake!

German boyfriend loved it!

I've made this twice now, once with apples and the next with pears and craisins - both time delish.  Yes it is "eggy" and you can cut back on both sugar and butter, but it is truly a baked crepe and yummy!  I used a cast iron skillet with great results.

I love this recipe, however if you make it the night before does the batter need to be refrigerated and if so do you need to let it come to room temp before using or just straight out of the fridge?

I think this is my favorite German Apple Pancake recipe so far-almost perfect.  I did add a second apple, though I kept the topping ingredients otherwise the same.  When melting the butter, I let it brown accidentally, but really liked the flavor that added to the batter so would do that again next time.  Served with apple syrup and apple butter; fabulous breakfast.

Delish and easy! I substituted egg beaters for the eggs, and whole wheat flour for the white flour; made a mixture of brown sugar (instead of using white sugar), cinnamon and nutmeg for sauteing the apples at the end. And used almond extract instead of vanilla. I didn't have time to let the batter sit, and it was still puffy and wonderful. Everyone raved.

Made this today for our Easter brunch. I had to transport it so I cooked the apples and put them in a 13x9, and then made the bater and kept it seperate until it was time to cook it. I think next time I'll cut the sugar even more, becasue we serve it with maple syrup so it became a little too sweet. I did double the recipe as we had 6 people. But overall itwas really good and I will make it again!

This recipe is outstanding.  I fixed it for a German friend of mine and she said it was the best she had eaten and asked for the recipe.  I used a cast iron skillet.

This is very good and easy!!! Next time I'm going to try making it in individual serving dishes. It's very filling. It's more like a soufle.

This was a very tasty recipe, but I felt that it could have used more apples. We made it with 2 apples and it still felt like it wasn't enough! We also cut back on the butter, and didn't end up sacrificing any of the flavor.

This is fantastic! I made it with gluten free flour and nobody could tell the difference. I do change it up a little- I add more apples than the recipe calls for and it works out just fine.

I do not want to comment on the pancake batter, since after I had started cooking my apples, I realized I only had 2 eggs.  So I had to improvise a bit there (it still turned out good.)  However, I agree with those who say to cut back on the sugar in the apple mixture.  It is very good, but very sweet.  I did use 2 apples as per some reviewer's suggestions, but next time I would like to try with just 1, as the apples really overpowered the pancake (probably at least partially since I didn't make the pancake as directed.)  All in all a good recipe, will definitely be making again.  Edit:  Made this again, this time following the pancake batter directions.  It was good, although besides too much sugar, I also feel there is too much butter in the apple mixture.  It also needed longer than 10 minutes to finish cooking after I dropped the oven temperature; more like 20-25.  Next time I would probably leave out an egg and use a bit more flour, since the batter is very custard-y and a bit too eggy tasting for my husband.

DONT REDUCE SUGAR! If you're going to do anything, reduce eggs--the best part of the dish is the crispy/syrupy stuff on the bottom, and the more of the sugar/butter combo you use the more candied the bottom is...really yummy!! I would only advise reducing sugar if you were making it as a weekday type breakfast (more nutritious), but for a "weekend" feel, or special occasion, definitely use the suggested amount of sugar and butter.

It was so good! Like a bread pudding! I didn't know it would puff up so high in the oven...then within 5 minutes of taking it out, it aired out and sank. It was cool, my 5 year old thought it was fun to watch and yummy to eat!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made this many times and every time it is just as good as the last. I will add for anyone looking to reduce calories I minus the white sugar use only a 1/4 c of brown sugar and 1/4 c butter. I did spray my pan before hand. Also I used honeycrisp apples in it and they do not need any sure added it is wonderful and the apples do stay whole and not mushy.

Made this all the time growing up and make it now for my daughter. My brothers never liked apples, so my mom just made it plain and doubled it in cake pan for our family breakfasts. We loved it drizzled with warm syrup or homemade jam. Also called it Pannekuchen.

this was REALLY good.  only used 3 eggs and used 2 apples instead of 1.  Used Splenda and Smart Balance for sugar and butter.  I would probably add more spice and maybe some Splenda brown suger on top of the apples.

This is an excellent recipe that I made for Easter Sunday. The only issue that I had was I tripled the recipe and only put it in a 13x9 pan and the pan was NOT big enough. It cooked for almost an hour. The end result was fantastic though.

Very good, but I think less eggs and cooking the apples in butter first might be helpful.  But very close to the Orig. Pancake house receipe.

Update:  I made this recipe again since there were soo many great reviews.  This time it I used store bought eggs - it turned out great.  Still cut the butter in the pan by half - 2 T instead of 1/4 cup.  Used 1 apple this last time too.  The only complaint is that there isn't enough - it seems like there should be more.   Maybe the first time I didn't let it sit long enough too...  Original review: Good taste, texture was off though.  Perhaps it was the farm fresh eggs I used - I tried to use the same size as a typical store egg, but I'm sure it was more egg yolk than the store brands.  The batter was very runny and after baking, the texture was kind of clumpy.  I also think something more can be done to create a great texture with the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and apples at the bottom.  I did add double the apples and halved the butter as several other reviewers did.

Fabulous though filling, especially for the ladies.
using a 5" skillet mixure can be cut into 1/3's and works great, still cook for 20 min. though.
Top with Apple pie filling and or "Orange sauce for crepes" (on AllRecipes).

Yummy!  I cut back on the butter and sugar a little, and it worked fine. I might cut back even more next time.

Tasty, but eggy - more than normal "German" or Dutch-baby pancakes I've had before. Also way too much nutmeg!  Probably won't make again unless I cut back on both the egg and the nutmeg.

i realize that it has been made clear that this is a fairly eggy recipe.  i think that is an understatement.  i'm not sure why this recipe is titled as a german apple pancake.  for those who have ever had or made a true german apple pancake, this is nothing like it.  i lost my fav recipe and pulled this one because, aside from some comments about eggy-ness, it got great reviews.  made it for a brunch for 8 adults and not a single one of them believed me that is was a german apple pancake.  it tasted fine but did not rise at all (my ingredients were all fresh) and turned out like a thin custard with apples in it.  i would recommend it if you are looking for an apple custard... not a german apple pancake (which normally puffs up alot and is quite filling).

I loved the idea of this, and it was okay. The texture could be better- it was a bit mushy and eggy in parts, but it was a nice change of pace for breakfast. No complaints from the family, but no raves either.

My family loves this as a weekend breakfast treat.  I double it and put it in a big glass lasagna dish and it works very well (also tried it in the Pampered Chef 12" family skillet, but it took quite a bit longer to cook).  We serve it with some whipped cream, too.  I often "cheat" and use two cans of sliced apples to save time.  Makes it extra easy!

I give this recipe a "high" five. I thought the preparation was easy and cook time, quick. This makes the perfect Sunday breakfast considering you can prepare the batter the night before. I actually ended up using two medium size granny smiths since I thought one would not be enough. My kids loved this as much as traditional buttermilk pancakes. This one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Extremely tasty.  I don't have a cast iron skillet so I followed other reviewers advice and used a pie dish.  I also 1/2ed the nutmeg per others recommendation.  I still give it five stars because those things are just matter of preference.  My 2 and 3 year old gobbled it up and my husband couldn't stop saying how good it was.  Will make again for sure.

just awesome! my husband and i made this for a sunday morning breakfast to get out of the chocolate chip waffle routine, and these were amazing. some other recipes for this use too much egg (in my opinion) but this was just right! i added a little extra vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and it was delicious! thanks!

Really enjoyed it.  Fun to do.  The kids loved seeing it put together.  Will decrease an egg and perhaps add some cinnamon next time as other are suggesting.  But, this is just fun and tasty.  I did use a minimal amt of butter w/ sugar - just enough to line the iron skillet I used.  That worked well w/ the sugar and it didn't stick, so no problem doing w/ less.

I made this on Christmas morning.  My Mom and Dad liked it, but I thought it was way too eggy (I used 3XL eggs).  The apples were good though.  I agree with the post that said this is more of a custard than a pancake. Probably won't make this again unless Mom & Dad ask for it.

This was good...I also didn't have an oven safe skillet, but cooking the apples seperately worked fine. It was good warm, but I found that the leftovers that were cold were even better!!!

This was good.  I cut the sugar in half because I wanted to put a bit of maple syrup on mine.  I used a Honeycrisp apple.  I would cut down on the nutmeg- it's the dominant flavor and overpowers the cinnamon.  I don't have an oven-proof skillet, so like others, I cooked the apples/sugar/spices in a skillet w/one TBS butter while I melted 2 TBS of butter in a 10-inch pie dish in the oven.  Then I poured the apple mix into the pie plate, and poured the egg batter on top of that.  Had to bake about 5 minutes longer than specified.  It's tasty and looks good too.  (And this is supposed to be eggy/custardy, it's NOT like a traditional buttermilk pancake).

This is much more of a sweet omellette than a pancake. I should have realized that based on the ratio of egg to flour. My mother used to make German Apple Pancakes in the oven and they were lighter, more crepe like than this recipe which is more like a custard. I used nice granny smith apples for this recipe and that part was delicious. I'd strongly suggest using real apples and not canned pie filling.

Ive taken alot of recipes off this website before and have not ever had one go foul. Until today. I thought something was fishy with only using a half cup of flour for pancakes. It was like a gross oven omlet with apples, sugar, and butter.

Superb!  Suggest using a steep sided sauté pan over an omelet skillet with rounded sides.  This will help keep the growing Dutch baby contained while baking

Fantastic recipe!  My whole family loved it including my 4yr old and 1 yr old!  It has such a great look and tastes like if came from a restaurant!  The only thing I will change next time is add less butter to the pan.  I will probably put 2 or 3 tbsp instead of 1/4 cup.  I will definitely be making this again!  :)

I LOVE this recipe. My mom used to make something similiar when I was a kid. Making it in a skillet really makes a difference. I have made this several times and it came out much better when it was in the skillet. I also cut down on the amount of butter I put on the skillet. I use just enough to cover the skillet thinly, 1/4 of a cup is too much and causes the dish to be too buttery.

It’s about time I give this a 5-star review. Over the past 5yrs or so since finding this recipe it has become a staple for Saturday and Sunday mornings. It’s perfect for those slow days we get once in awhile and just get to chill as a family. Love it!

OMG, Love it !!!
However it was a little confusing, for me anyway. 
In the directions, the amount of sugar to use for each step wasn't listed. The ingredients said 1/2 cup divided. But the directions just said sugar, not the amount. 
I will definitely make it again. Also, sharing recipe with family.

Oh wow, puffy pancake winner!! I’ve been trying variations of this B type of recipe over the past years because, well, I love them. And yes,  so does the fam. This one is great because it is more dense due to the larger amount of eggs and it tastes so good. Used a cast iron skillet and because of previous experience added a tblspn more butter to prevent sticking. The cooking in the pan prev to going into the oven works great. Because I didn’t have the overnight wait time, I did it in the blender and let it sit while I cooked....BACON! Oh yes, I crumbled bacon onto the sliced Granny Smiths. Was wanting to try this for a while and I loved it. My wife not so much but did enjoy the pancake otherwise.

I did make some changes, I used the cast iron to cook the apples with the butter and I used a recommendation of brown sugar/white sugar w cinnamon, no nutmeg. then I poured the mix over it and baked it. 
very good.

I thought it was good, but it was very, very sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar, probably leave out the last 1/4 cup.  Grandchildren did not care for it at all.

Cinnamon & "Chinese" 5 spice at your peril... also check an orange  & milk use in traditional "Mexican" Carnitas.  Be sure to "mash & drizzle" the meat  while  under the broiler. 
Otherwise a good start for a non-traditional pork shoulder (Boston Butt)....  Carnitas.  Like most home "chefs", review several recipes and read the suggestions to 'cherry pick' to your tastes.

So good! 
Made a Paleo version with Paleo Flour and Coconut Sugar. 
Added extra apples and top it with maple syrup. 

It's gone or I'd post a picture.

I have always wanted to make a baked apple pancake and I am so happy how this recipe turned out! Personal taste Changes:  I always cut nutmeg measurements in half.   Other notes:  I started out making this with a different recipe so I had already coated two large Granny Smith apples with 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar.

So delicious!  I don't have a skillet I can put in my oven so have to pour butter and apple mixture into a pie pan after it bubbles and pour egg mixture over the top to bake it. Still works great!

This is the recipe I’ve used for years. I’m so glad I found it on here so I can access it easily. I usually use two apples and double the cinnamon. I also pour the apple mixture from the pan to a deep dish pie Plate and then bake, but only because I have family members that don’t understand “don’t touch the handle!! The whole thing is hot!” I throw one Tbsp of butter in the pie plate and toss it in the oven while I’m cooking the apples. It keeps the Dutch baby from sticking and gets the pie plate nice and hot, which for some reason makes a difference.

I let the batter sit for 30 minutes. Came out delicious work with no changes. Next time I will try to reduce the butter by a little bit as well as the sugar to try to make it healthier.

I used 4 smaller Pink Lady apples for the filling, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was lovely and simple... its soooo rich.  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet, it came out nice though I had to do the Pineapple Upside Down cake method of flipping ti get it onto a plate

I made minimal changes like using cinnamon sugar as I am not crazy about nutmeg, . I mixed up the batter in my blender and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour and I poured the batter in my hot skillet then spread the apples on top of the batter before putting the skillet back in the oven.

I make this regularly and it is honestly one of my very favorite recipes. I would say that this recipe is really best with a tart apple like Granny Smith. A sweet apple would make the whole balance of this too sweet in my opinion.

Thanks so much for the recipe. This was wonderful, my husband even said YUMMY! Made it pretty much the same as recipe but a little less sugar and butter. Didn’t have a cast iron skillet that big so precooked the apple and poured into a large pie plate. Worked out perfectly. Much like Cooks country’s Cherry Clafoutis , but easier. Will make again!

This was my first time making and eating a German Pancake/Dutch Baby.  I've always wondered what they tasted like and if I could make them successfully.  I must say, I've been missing out on something wonderful.  At first I was disappointed with the way it flattened out after taking it out of the oven.  But I think this is the nature of this dish.  What I loved the most was the crepe-like, custard-like texture and also the flavors were wonderful.  I can see that I'll be making this again, using other fruits, etc.

Pros: Directions were clear. It was easy to make. It did puff up in the oven. After baking, it was removed from the pan easily with minimal sticking. My favorite part was the caramelized effect on the bottom.
Cons: There was an excess of butter seeping out and I felt the nutmeg was a bit heavy handed. The puff deflated quickly. Sweet and more like a custard dessert than breakfast. Is it a dessert?
Changes: I baked it in a pyrex pie dish. I served it with whipped cream.

Flavors are delicious!  I would make some changes.  I added two apples and was glad I did.  I made it in a slightly smaller Dutch oven and increased cooking time by 15 minutes.  I followed the directions, but I think it’s better to prepare the apples and sugar in a separate pan, then pour the batter in to the cooking pan, and put the apples on top.  We had some sticking in the pan that was pretty severe even with all the butter.  Great flavors.  A personal preference is I doubled the cinnamon and would probably triple it next time as we love the spice!  Wonderful flavors and everyone requested I make it again.  Some said tomorrow!  A very good recipe.  Letting the batter rest is key to having it rise nicely.  Not enough recipes tell you to have the batter rest!

Followed other reviews and added a second apple. Otherwise kept it to the original! Word of warning to put a pan on the rack below your frying pan as my oven is all Smokey now lol!

I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used half a tsp and added the inside of one vanilla bean, which turned out delicious. I have made this recipe with normal flour but tgis time I used gluten free bread flour (Jovial brand - mix of sorghum, teff, millet, brown rice, & xanthan gum) and its very similar either way, so I can recommend it for those who are looking to make it gluten free. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that its a bit on the eggy side, and doesn't puff up and then flatten out like an apple pancake from a restaurant. I end up with a egg cake at the end, but it's definitely delicious, so it deserves a solid B+.

Made recipe as suggested, except I cooked the apples and spices in the microwave in a pie plate while the oven was heating up. I poured the batter over the hot, cooked apples in the pie plate and then placed it in preheated oven. I did have to cook it a little longer but it was so good, my husband, the man that always refuses pancakes, ate it and requested I make it again! Success!

I believe I did everything according to directions except added a little more apple and lessened the butter in the skillet. We felt it came out very dry.  I won’t make this again.

Made it just as the recipe says. 

Way to much butter. And not Enough Apple. 
Felt that the sugar on the pan was kind of a wasted step. As it disappeared when we put the pan on medium heat before the batter was poured in.  I think it would have been better on the top of the whole thing before baking.

This ia delicious! I didn't expect the apples to float, but they ended up beautifully crisp at the top, with crisp edges (I cooked it a little longer). It reminds me of the apple pancake from the original house of pancakes, but this is a fluffier recipe! It is wonderful!

I made this exactly per the directions.  The skillet really added to the flavor of the dish because sautéing the sugar mixture and apples turned it into a wonderful caramelized bottom.  I would make this again and I highly recommend it.

I’ve made this following the exact recipe and it’s great. This time I used what I had on hand: Asian pears, regular pears and walnuts. When I melted the butter I roasted the walnuts in it first, added all the sugar and spices and added quick oatmeal to give  it some more texture. It worked out really well - it is sweet,  so maybe it’s more of a coffee cake than a pancake.

Very good. It’s called a pancake and I can see how it would be misleading and people complaining it about being too eggy. I used half of the sugar because  it just seemed to much as I was using it.

Four eggs is way too many. If I made it again I would maybe reduce it to three eggs and add a little more flour, but there's no way I'm making this again. I've eaten other German apple pancakes before and this was nowhere close to those - it was more like a clammy omelet than anything remotely resembling a pancake.

This was very good. I prefer the texture of a different dutch baby recipe (that doesn't have baking powder). This one is more of an eggy French toast whereas the other is more flat and dense. I  will probably try the apple/sugar yummyness from this one and the batter from the other next time.

Don’t do what I did! The first time I made this recipe I thought it was odd to layer all the ingredients in the bottom of a hot pan. So after I sprinkled sugar on the apples, I mixed the whole thing up, poured the batter on top, and I put it in the oven. The result was that the entire recipe stuck to the bottom of the pan, and when I dug it out, the whole pancake deflated. The second time I made the recipe, I followed it exactly. It didn’t stick. The apples floated to the top, cooked perfectly, and there was a beautiful caramel crust on the bottom of the pancake. This is an awesome recipe! Just follow the directions!

My wife loved this.  This was the best Apple Pancake I have made.  I made only three small changes.  I used a glass pie pan as my cast iron pans are in a different state right now.  After sprinkling some of the sugar spice mix on the bottom of the pan, I tossed the apple slices in a bowl with the rest of sugar mix to coat them.  This made it easier to seperate the slices and lay them in the pan.  The glass pan probably made the cooking time a little longer, but that was all.  Great overall.

I have been looking for a recipe for this for a while.  It is definitely an eggy dish and not to be compared really with a traditional pancake.  I didn't have an oven-safe pan (it seems like they are disappearing as we all move toward non-stick) so I simply used a 9" cake pan.  I placed it on my stove top, melted and simmered the butter/apple mixture and popped it in the oven. Worked very well!  A note on the spices: this has a very strong nutmeg component, and if you don't care for it you should reduce or eliminate.  It would have been great with a bit more cinnamon. A few more apple slices would have been fine, but it was fantastic"as is"!  I'll probably try mixing brown sugar in next time, but I would not reduce butter since this is where the pancake is so decadant and quite the treat!

If you “double” the apples, use two medium sized apples instead of two large apples and allow for a little extra simmering time on the stove before pouring the batter over.

Too much butter and sugar.  Teen complained was too soupy.  Toddler complained too sweet ( yeah you read that right).  They made me finish it, I might need to visit the dentist.

Previous recipes were much more robust in flavor and definitely not soupy and overly sweet.

Thanks for the attempt, but moving on.

This was delicious! I did not have a proper skillet and instead cooked my apples in the oven before I poured the batter in. Mine was not cooked fully following the time exact times given,  but that could be because of either how I cooked the apples or the glass pan I was using or even my oven. That is my own fault and not the recipe :). I will surely be making this again!

This dish doesn't require baking powder. It doesn't require a leavening agent because it soufflés on its own. One of my all time favorite holiday dishes!

Never made it, but seeing the recipe reminded me of my (German) grandma's apple pancakes. They were the best & I miss them terribly!

Nice,  fancy breakfast for Christmas morning.  Didn't have granny smith (tart) apples,  so used 1 Fuji and 1 Gala.  (doubled the apple called for,  as some reviews suggested.  Because they are sweet apples,  and to make it healthier,  used a little, e less than 1/3rd cup sugar (not 1/2 cup) . I also only used 1Tbsp butter to coat the pan,  not 1/4 cup.   Doubled the amt Cinnamon as some suggested.  It came out fantastic... Very light,  not overly sweet.  Dusted with confectioners sugar and served.

very custardly, next time would add 1/4c flour for more pancakey.  
didnt use all that butter to grease the pan- just about 2T and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the 2 apples before piling on the batter.
easy peasy and quick to bake- perfect for our Xmas mornings.

Made as directed.  Tasty although eggy, which I think is to be expected.   Looked great in skillet,  but fell apart when removing slices.  I used iron skillet.  What I thought were burnt edges were actually delicious areas of caramelized sugar.

Yeahhh. I don't have an oven proof pan so I put this in a cake pan. I should have put it in a pie pan. Baked for an extra 5 minutes. Probably should have increased another 5 minutes. It came out and stayed more like a souffle. Hopefully with a pie pan the baking time will be closer to the recipe since the surface area is larger and will collapse like a dutch baby. Will make again next week.

Absolutely great!  Easy and not your average pancake.  The slices and sharing just make it more special.  I prepared it exactly as directed, with extra apple, and I still would put more apple, but that's just me.  Came out exactly like the photo.

I've tried several different recipes for this type of pancake.  This one is a bit sweeter than others I've had.  Normally, I have to serve with a little maple syrup; I'm glad I tasted this one first because it was sweet!  I would make this recipe again, but I would cut the sugar a bit.  It baked up nicely in my cast iron fry pan.  I would also ensure I used a very tart apple instead of a sweet one.

I was looking for a recipe my grandmother and mother use they would call this "apple Washington pancake" and use a can of apples. I doubled this recipe and cut the sugar in half since I was using  Apple pie filling. I used 3/4 of the suggested milk and added a small punch of extra flour and it came out wonderful. I love this recipe because of the eggy taste and fluffy, light texture.

This was amazing, almost like an apple omelette/pancake thing? Hard to explain really but delicious. My son loved it. Will definitely make it again. I used four or five small apples because I didn't have one large one, but other than that kept to the recipe. Very tasty!

Absolutely delicious! A new family breakfast staple!
It rose perfectly and had a great souffle like texture.
I only used half the nutmeg suggested because of personal preference, and it still had a great nutmeg flavor without being overpowering.

This was wonderful.  I  did make a couple of changes to suit my preferences:  I added 1/4 C of flour, used four apples and added  brown sugar on top of the apples before baking.   When I was ready to serve it, I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.   I love that I was able to do all of the prep work the night before.

This was divine! My kids gobbled it up.  The only thing I did differently, was stir the apples a little bit as they were bubbling on the stovetop. 

It came out perfect-- custard-like center with the flaky pastry sides.

I love this one and have made it many times. I'm dying to try it with other fruit (pears, peaches, plums, quince) or a savory version without the sugar made with potatoes, onions, or leeks. Right now I'm making it with a bit of honey because I don't have sugar. Seems fine so far.

I use 1/2 sugar because I like to drizzle maple syrup after it's done baking. Very tasty.

The first time I made this we only had 2 eggs. The second time I made this I only had 1/2 cup of white sugar. So I used brown sugar in the batter and white in the pan. It was more custard texture the second batch. And very moist. I like the first batch better because I'm not a fan of sweet custard. But I'm going to try to dry it out more. The edges are nice.

FOLLOW THE RECIPE!  Shocked people give it under 5 stars and then proceed to mention pie dishes,  doubled apples,  apple pie filing, half the butter...if you want to make it healthier,  eat a banana and have a bowl of cheerios while dreaming of eating this.  No wonder you didn't like it,  you made your own rendition and ruined a perfectly fine breakfast!

I've made  this recipe 4 times since I found it. It's simple and delicious. It's not the editors fault but I wish it were a little less eggy. Other than that, yu-mmy!!

This was very good.  I followed directions exactly  except using  Honeycrisp apples as that is what I had on hand.  Used the Cast Iron Skillet and it came out beautifully.  I did have to add an additional ten minutes to the cooking time.   Don't think I would want this on a weekly basis, but rather a once in  a while treat.

We loved this. It was a study in contrasting textures - dense, moist, and eggy in the middle, sticky toffee chewy on the bottom, light, airy, crispy edges. I'll keep this recipe handy for weekend breakfasts.

I made this recipe exactly as it's written. It was good. It reminded me more of French toast. I think 4 eggs is too much. I really tastes egg with each bite. I expected more of a pancake taste. Next time I make it I'll use less egg and more apples

Very easy to make. I halved the sugar and increased cinnamon to 1 and 1/4 teaspoons, as recommended by others. I used three medium-large sized apples and I'd say that's a good ratio. They were the sweeter kind and quite soft but it wasn't an issue. I sautéed the apples in a skillet and then transferred to a pan, as I don't have an ovenproof skillet. One piece of warning: the egginess and the texture may not be for everyone.

Pancake? Not even close. Sweet quiche? Almost. Delicious? To each their own.
I was really looking for an apple PANCAKE recipe similar to what they sell at Egg & I but this is far from that. This is a super moist sweet quiche with sweetened apples. Not my taste and will not make again but it did come out looking beautiful out of the oven.  I halved the nutmeg and glad I did. If this is the egg recipe you're looking for I would also reduce the butter by at least 2 Tbls and reduce the sugar. This was too watery/moist for a firm quiche, consistency was almost like flan.

EXCELLENT! I didn't have apples. I only had pears from our tree. The pears were still a bit crunchy, so I sauteed them in lots of butter, then added brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. The pears were soft and coated in a nice syrup. I added them just like the recipe says to do with the apples. The actual "Dutch Baby" pancake was perfect. Everything about this recipe makes it a keeper. It will be made for my family on many Sunday mornings to come.

This was very good and pretty easy to prepare. It really puffed up a lot in the oven (I used my cast iron skillet) and my 7 year old had 3 servings. The  middle was still a bit wet, however, even when the top was dark brown. Next time I will play with the temperature to make sure everything cooks at the same time. Also, the leftovers didn't heat up well.

We really enjoyed this. However, I would likely double the recipe and make it in a larger pan next time, since it didn't quite quite seem to be enough for 4 people. It was delicious though!

GLUTEN-FREE, NO SKILLET REVIEW: I've probably made this about 15 times now. My family LOVES it. We have to avoid most grains, so I have used Pamela's Artisan Flour or Perfect Health Diet flour, which I mix on my own, (with about 1/16 tsp of xanthin gum added to the 1/2 cup flour in this recipe). They are both perfect substitutions. I at least TRIPLE the amount of apples. I leave the skins on the apples, sauté the apples in butter and cinnamon briefly in a regular frying pan, and then transfer the apples to a butter-greased glass pie dish. I pour the batter on top and cook as directed! It's AMAZING!! (However, it NEVER cooks in the amount of time directed. It usually takes 45mins, checking often to see if it's done.)

My husband is just crazy for this.  In one cooking, I used fresh peaches, and he said that it was better than peach cobbler - that's saying a lot coming from him.  Then, I topped it with whipped cream.

Thought it was really good, my son who is the authority on a things pizza and pancakes said it was good but more like French toast. It however didn't just slide out of the pan, it was no longer round by the time I got it to the plate.

I made this as written with the exception of replacing the nutmeg with additional cinnamon.  I wish that I had followed other reviewer's recommendation to reduce the baking powder because this puffed up WAY above my cast iron skillet and some of the apples toppled over into our stove.  The product was delicious nonetheless, but a bit messier and puffier than I think necessary. I'd maybe use 1/4 or 1/8 tsp of baking powder next time.

Delicious and aesthetic to look at. I used Granny Smith apples. Next time I will try Honeycrisp. I'm also going to try a bit more flour and a tad less milk. Just because we like a bit more "cake".

Looked beautiful (puffed nicely). However, many problems in recipe. First, way too much nutmeg. Second, the cook time is way off, it came out under-cooked. Third, too much butter. Finally, only major change we made was cutting 1/3rd of the sugar and it was stilltoo  sweet.

This was my first time making this as an adult (I remember helping my mom make this). I didn't have a Dutch oven pan so I used a 9 inch pan. Also I forgot the last 1/4 cup sugar on the apples so sprinkled it after the batter was added to the apples. Still turned out GREAT! My two year old devoured it! Why go out to a pancake house on a busy Saturday, wait in line, wait for the food, eat the food and pay a big bill! Do it yourself!

Friends, a little tip: put it on the top oven rack so it has room to bubble up! Also, who only wants 1/2 tsp of cinnamon? Make it 2 glorious heaping ones.

Looked at the recipe, thought about making, made it, then ate it.  GREAT.  Taste just like Walker Bros. in North Chicago.  Didn't, quit look like Walker Bros., but sure did taste good.  Haven't have one in a long time.  I'll make it again for sure.

Well, I'm a cheater.  I used Krusteez pancake mix for the batter.  I also split the sugar - half brown sugar, half white sugar.  I've made it both ways, and each tasted great, but the original has a different texture..more like an egg custard taste.  But for a quick morning breakfast, this worked!

An excellent recipe that I tried on my own after my dad made it for me while visiting. It can also be used with other fruits like bananas, peaches, or blackberries, by themselves or right along with the apples!

My family loves this recipe.  We have probably made it a dozen times.  I always skip the nutmeg, and I frequently skip the cinnamon.  I also reduce the sugar in the apples by half.  My oven runs hot too so I reduce the initial temperature to 400.  It is really great though.  My kids adore it.

Sorry, but this wasn't to my taste at all. The texture and flavor were more like a souffle or omelet than a pancake. By itself that would be OK (I like souffles), but I didn't think it went well with all of the sugar and apples. I was surprised to see how little flour there was for the number of eggs. Also, even though I like nutmeg, I thought the nutmeg flavor was overpowering - I suggest cutting back on it (you can always sprinkle more on top when it's done if you want). I won't make this again - next time I'll try the recipe from America's Test Kitchen, which uses half the eggs for the same amount of flour.

Really good! I made it almost exactly as written, my only oven-proof skillet was a little too small, so I did the skillet steps and then transferred to a pie pan. I sprinkled powdered sugar on it, served it warm, and it was delicious, a unique texture, but good. The one thing I thought might be a good addition to try as a topping is a cinnamon/pecan streusel, so I might try that in the future. I know some people commented on adding additional cinnamon, but I put the amount in the recipe and didn't feel like it needed any more, it was good as written. I might try a little less butter next time, but it was definitely good as written.

Awesome and a definte "do-over" per my husband. More like a cross between fruench toast and bread pudding. Made as the recipe called for however, next time, I will cut down on the 1/4 cup butter called to melt in the skillet. It was a bit much for my liking. Thank you for this great recipe!

It looked really nice until I tried to flip it over, it stuck really bad and tore in half. :( I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it and ate it anyway. It is like a really eggy apple fritter. tastes good, looks like a mess. i might try this again using a pie dish instead of a cast iron dutch oven.

I changed this recipe quite a bit to accommodate my low sugar/fat diet.  I wanted more of a fluffy pancake, so decreased the eggs by  1 (would just use 2 next time) and added 2/3 c flour.  Used splenda instead of sugar.  Only 1 T butter in batter and Pam in the skillet.  Used Winesap apples, so didn't added any to them.  Cooked them in the microwave first, then into the skillet.  One T Splenda on top of the whole shebang and baked.  I'm still going to look for a more cakey apple pancake recipe though.

Yum!  Got 2 thumbs up from my 3 year old and my husband practically licked the pan.  Like others have stated I used 2 apples (fuji) and only 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan.  Will be making it again!

I thought this was a delicious change from our typical breakfast fare. It was easy to make and my family all liked it as well. We served it with a homemade applesauce that has some golden raisins in it, and maple syrup. I did double the recipe and used 2 pans for it and that turned out fine.

All the butter made it heavy and too much nutmeg for our tastes.  Also read directions and plan ahead if need to; this recipe is not "Ready in 45 minutes" as the recipe page states.  The batter has to "stand for 30 minutes or overnight" which is in addition to the 45 minutes.

Delicious.  I have been making the Pampered Chef version of this for years, but always found it had too much flour.  This is much better.  I did double the apples with the same amount of butter.  This alteration required a few extra minutes of baking time.

I made this for breakfast and it looked and smelled so good and I couldn't wait to eat it.  I was disappointed in the texture after it was cooked.  I left it in the oven longer than directed because it looked like the batter wasn't cooked.  It did not firm up, and it still tasted like raw batter after being in the oven for 25 minutes.

Quick and easy, but did not turn out like another I had made in the past. This one was more like a custard in the middle when it was done. Tasted good, but not the texture I was looking for.

I had apples that needed to be used so I typed in "apple breakfast" and this recipe popped up.  Being of German decent and loving my grandmother's apple yeast cakes.  I thought I had to give it this a shot.  The only change I made was to double the apples.  This was delicious. It was a sweet eggy goodness.  Since my husband is a diabetic I did use splenda blend...  so I guess I made 2 changes.  Nevertheless, I will make this again.  Thank you so much Mollie Cole for a wonderful tasty morning!!!

The flavour was good but mine really was too egg-y. I followed the recipe exactly. I was expecting closer to a crepe-like texture only thicker (not doughy) but I had scrambled eggs/quiche in the center. I used large eggs and I think they might have been too big. I plan on trying this again with only 3 eggs to see if the texture improves. I liked that it wasn't doughy but I really don't think mine turned out right, it was too egg-y. Hopefully next time I can find the right balance.

I use 2 large apples instead of the 1 called out in the recipe. This recipe is a hit with everyone in our household.

This is my third straight Sunday  I do not think I will ever get tired of this recipe. My Mum said the taste brought her back to her childhood. Nummers. : )) I am going to play with the recipe and try with bananas now, I will let y'all know how that worked out.

The flavor was great!  I did have to cook it for about 10 extra minutes on 375.  However, it was a great recipe!  Thank you for sharing.

This was great and easy to make in the morning for everyone. The texture wasn't quite like I anticipated- don't expect a regular pancake! Mmm, sweet, buttery and delicious- what more could you want to wake up to?

Absolutely delicious! Flavor and texture are wonderful. I tried it both with fresh apples and with canned pie filling, the flavor is definitely better with the fresh, crisp apples. This is a favorite breakfast for company.

It looks so good I wish it turned out better for me. I made the batter the night before and refigerated it... i dont know if that was my problem of wha, but it cooked unevenly, after cutting off the puffed edges I put it back in and in the end it tasted good but way to much trouble for what i end up with--especially in the morning, haha.

I have never had a German pancake before.  I thought it was really greasy with not enough apples.  The kids said "too eggy."

I agree, this recipe is quite eggy and could probably scale back on the nutmeg.  I haven't found another recipe yet that matches what I am looking for in this type of dish.  I've made it twice and it is just okay.  I may try it again with a few changes.

Not quite.  The caramel got hard, instead of gooey.  The pancake and apples were mushy.  My search continues.

Outstanding!  First time trying something like this and it was flawless.  I did add double the cinnamon, and used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup sugar to add a little more depth of flavor.  Custard like middle, crispy outside.  Can hardly wait to make it again!

My husband isn't a breakfast person but he went for seconds!  I've made German pancakes before but this recipe is by far superior to the other one I tried.  The next time I make it I'll add extra apples and definitely half the amount of butter.

I enjoyed this - the flavors were very interesting.  I used a slightly smaller pan, which made a thicker pancake.  This made it taste a little more egg-like I beleive and would have been better if a little thinner.

My huband absolutely loves the dutch baby served at the Original Pancake house in Portland.  We moved out of state and I've tried to replicate it with this recipe without success.  I agree with less or no nutmeg at all and I am yet to get it to cook right, but if you have patience it is definitely a recipe worth toying around with becuase it is a to die for combination when done right.

Gooey and good!  It's more sugar and butter than I am used to, however it was really good and the kitchen smelled wonderful.  Used 1 and 1/2 Granny Smith apples to fill the pan.  Also the pancake was not going to slide onto a platter so I served it in the cast iron skillet.

This was very good ! I made it for my mom as a thank you gift and we sat up all night eating it ! My mom has a great set of cast iron skillets so i used the 10 inch one to bake it. Yes it is sorta eggy but it does have 4 eggs in it so I can see why. We still loved the taste, texture, and the aroma that was left in the house for hours. We loved it so much I was asked to make it again tonight, can't wait !!!

It is like 'custard', not the 'american pancake' taste or consistency. It tasted great though and very easy to make.

We loved this recipe.  We love German pancakes, so this was right up our alley.  I followed the recipe with just a few minor tweaks.  I didn't measure the cinnamon, vanilla or nutmeg...just put it in.  I also used about 1/2 + cup of diced pineapple, which my family loves.  I made the batter and it sat only as long as it took me to prepare the apples and cook mixture on the stove.    Great recipe and super easy. Thank you!

OMG! Very yummy..go the extra mile and purchase an iron skillet, season it properly over time, and you can't beat the difference in the taste of this and other dishes like it. Great dish for breakfast, brunch, or dessert served warm with ice cream!

It was ok...I probably would not make again. 2 out of 3 people in my household tried and said it was tolerable....but not nearly as good as the other things I normally make.

I didn't care for the texture of this -way too eggy -I should have known with 4 eggs!.  It has good potential.  I decreased the nutmeg to 1/8 tsp in both areas (it called for an awful lot).  After baking it seemed raw in the center so I kept adding time -I don't know how long I ended up baking it but the texture was still kind of eggy/mushy but the flavor was really good.  Next time I'll cut back to 2 eggs, add an extra apple and keep everything else the same to see how that comes out.  I think this could be good with some modifications.  Oh, and my dad loved it as is.  I served it with a little powdered sugar and syrup but it really didn't need it.

This recipe was okay.  The presentation is outstanding.  The flavor was more "eggy" than I was expecting, but it did have lots of eggs.  Seemed very rich.  We put cranberry syrup over it to add some flavor.  It really reminded me of bread pudding.

This pancake is tasty but I think that there is a bit too much butter in the recipe - it seemed really greasy. Next time I'll use less butter in the pan before baking it. Also, mine turned out a bit soggy - i did pull it out a couple minutes early because the edges were getting "done" but it seemed really mushy in the middle - still tasty.

Very good.  Like others I cut the eggs down and doubled the apples.  Nice to have something different than the same old breakfast food.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this was not what I expected. The filling was very mushy and eggy.

Excellent. Tasted a little eggy, but that was to be expected with this recipe and nobody minded. I added a bit more cinnamon and completely cut out the nutmeg, but it was still really good!

This was excellent!  Reminds me of the Baby Apple I used to get from Bickford's in Portsmouth, NH. I used four apples of various sizes and followed the rest of the recipe to a T but would probably add more apples next time.  The kids loved it as well!

My family loves this recipe.  We really enjoy the different tastes and textures this recipe gives from common pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  The nutmeg in this recipe is heavy, so if you don't care for it you'll have to adjust.  I did have an oven-proof skillet though next time I'll choose a different shape with steeper sides.

This was good, but I think I will try a different one next time.  As other reviewers stated, it tastes very eggy, just a taste I personally do not enjoy.  My husband did like it though.

I can't convey in words how much I enjoy this recipe. First time I made it I was expecting more of a cake, but what it turned out to be was better than any regular apple pancake imo. Easy to make, and impressive when making for company.

Maybe it was me, but it never rose and ended up just tasting eggy and flat. The apples tasted great though!

Very tasty.  Made this morning for the wife and kid.  Good cinnamon and nutmeg flavor.  Might cut back on the number of eggs due to "eggy" taste but will definitely make again.  Thanks.

I would recommend using the "pie filling" apples and reduce the nutmeg by half.

I made this for company, despite the fact that I'd never tried it before, and I was so impressed by how easy it was! It presents very well, too- it looks like you spent much more time on it than it really takes. And it tastes delicious! I used a slightly bigger cast iron skillet, 2 Granny Smith apples, and just liberally sprinkled powdered sugar onto it. It's a keeper!

Terribly well written, actually. Easy to follow directions, and, with the sites ability to convert to metric measure, the recipe came out smashing.
Its not a "5" star recipe by any means, but 4 didn't do it any justice.
Its so easy to make, I can hardly wait for next years new apple crop. The Gravenstein beckons...

We tried this recipe hoping to duplicate a dish we have loved at restuarants.  This came close and was very good, but did not quite measure up to what we were looking for in two areas.  First, this was almost too sweet, even though we made it with Granny Smith apples.  Second, although we were seeking an eggy taste, the final product had less of the consistency of popovers and more of the consistency of scrambled eggs.  I would try using proportionately less eggs next time.  Still, this was very good.

This was very good!  I used a 10 inch square stoneware pan instead of the skillet and it turned out fine.  Next time I will not put the nutmeg in with the cinnamon sugar at the bottom, it was a little too "nutmeggy" for the kids.
