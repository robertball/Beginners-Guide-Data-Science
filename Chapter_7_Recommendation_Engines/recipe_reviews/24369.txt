A little too much peanut buter and vinagar for my taste.  I don't think I'll keep it in my recipe box.

Surprisingly delicious.  WOW!!  Who would have thought Miracle Whip and Peanut Butter would work well together.  I have made it twice and the second time I only put 1/4c peanut butter and 1/4c vinegar and it worked better for my family.  I also used this recipe for coleslaw and omitted the fruit and marshmallows...it too was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My mother made something like this in the 70s and I was craving it. I used honey to taste instead of sugar, used only 3 ounces of vinegar, and only apples with crunchy peanut butter. Just like Mom used to make. Thanks, Juli!

Has a little bit of an odd visual apperance.  Not really something that LOOKS appealing but it is definitely something worth making.

I was craving apple salad, but didn't have all of the ingredients on hand for the more traditional recipe.  I thought this one sounded good.  It isn't the prettiest salad to look at.  The dressing is good on the first bite, but then the tanginess almost becomes overpowering.  I think I would like it better without the peanut butter aspect of the dressing.

This recipe had an interesting flavor.  The salad dressing and peanut butter complimented each other well.  I found this recipe to be a bit too tangy and sweet for our family.  I may make it again and cut down on the sugar and vinegar or perhaps try a different variety of apple in it.  I give it an A for originality!
