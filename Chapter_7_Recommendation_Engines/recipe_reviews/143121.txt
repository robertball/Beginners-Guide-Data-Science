This marinade was fantastic! I marinaded it for at least 4 hours and our chicken came out so juicy and delicious. We out it on the grill with some BBQ sauce for a little extra kick

This was simple and yumm-ishous.  Used juice from canned pineapple (had that on hand) and grilled the rings. Also used 1/3 of splenda brown sugar and Veggie Oil rather than olive oil. Be aware that with all this sugar it could burn faster on your BBQ. Try same recipe with fresh Lime Juice! THANK YOU!

I think this is great!  Quick & Simple.  I did add a little minced garlic and some crushed black pepper to it.  I thought my steak turned out great.

Very easy and yummy! What I liked best was it adds flavor but is mild enough to allow the flavor of a good steak to shine through. Thank you!

This was okay.  Definitely needs salt - maybe even Soy Sauce.  It might be better as a chicken marinade too.

Just the smell of the marinade was amazing enough, but it was perfect on the steak. I matched it with grilled pineapple and a nice glass of pinot gris.

This recipe was a little oily for my taste...next time I will decrease the oil by half.  Other than that, pretty good.  I added 1/2 c. of honey to thicken it up and 2 pressed garlic cloves as well as a dash of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.

This was yummy. I didn't make it any changes.  It made my stir fry beef dish very delicious.

This was delicious as is, but I added a little garlic and red wine for more flavor.  It added flavor to the steak as well as tenderizing it. Would make it again.

This was good.  The Worchestershire sauce was a bit overwhelming to me (and I'm a big fan), but that may have been because I chose to marinate longer than two hours.
