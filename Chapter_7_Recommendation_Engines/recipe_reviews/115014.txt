I submitted this recipe and wanted to make it according to the directions allrecipes used.  They changed a few things.

The recipe is still good.  It doesn't need anywhere near that much butter though.  I melted a quarter cup of butter and put it in the halves of the squash and then added the rice/venison mixture.  After I took the squash out from under the broiler and cut the halves in half, butter just ran out.  I don't believe it was necessary to add that at all.

Secondly, there is about twice as much venison/rice mixture than is needed for one acorn squash.  This isn't too much of a problem though as I am more than happy to just eat that on its own.

So four stars because of the unnecessary butter.  Otherwise I hope you enjoy the recipe.

This was undoubtedly the best thing I have made. I added a dash of pine nuts to the mixture and used beef instead of venison. It makes a very impressive and showy main course that is warm comforting and filling. YOU MUST TRY IT

Beautiful dish and open for creativity! I used two squash venison sausage and dried cranberries. When browning the sausage I added some diced onion and celery. I too cut back on the brown sugar and butter. This was fabulous!

very good but too sweet for our tastes. Next time I would use 1/2 the brown sugar and twice the rice which would almost double the number of servings.

This recipe is so flexible and very creative for venison - which is why I gave it 5 stars. You can easily alter this recipe to taste and it still turns out great. Here is what I did: Per other reviews I decided to cut out the butter entirely and double the rice which was a rice blend with lentils. I added finely chopped mushrooms (portobella) - good addition - and used fresh cranberries cooked down a bit. I would skip the sugar too next time because we also do not love sweet dishes for dinner like another reviewer. I made a double batch easily. Thanks for a new idea for venison!

I used red rice instead of wild rice and dried cranberries instead of fresh (they didn't have them at the store). It was absolutely delicious! Even my 2 yr. old loved it. It was a bit too different for my meat-and-potatoes husband but he still ate it (I knew it wasn't to his taste when I cooked it but I can only do chili mac so many times). I think next time I'll use less sugar if I can't get fresh cranberries. The dried cranberries contain added sugar and I think that made the dish a bit too sweet. Also I used olive oil instead of butter - worked great & much healthier.

I followed this recipe to a t. My only change was cutting back the butter and sugar that was suggested by other viewers. We are not fans of sweet dinners and this meal was not for us.

Made this recipe tonight for me and my husband used half the brown sugar and no butter per the reviews and it was delicious! I wish I had cut the cinnamon back a little though too as it was a bit over powering but very glad I had cut the brown sugar--it was plenty sweet w/ the 1/4 cup. I also used ground venison sausage which has a stronger flavor & white rice instead of wild b/c it was what I had and the craisins--I cut them into tinier pieces w/ kitchen shears and added the pine nuts one reviewer suggested. I will definitely be making this again and having some dinner guests!

I made this recipe tonight. I used ground lamb instead of venison (could not get it)I drained off all of the fat & added a little chicken broth so it was healthier. I also grated & chopped onion carrots & zucchini sauteed them & added to the recipe as well as topping it w/ a sprinkle of breadcrumbs. Fabulous dish that I WILL be making again!

Easy and delicious! I used craisins instead of boiling cranberries and used moose burger instead of venison- just what I happened to have on hand. I also used less butter and half the brown sugar after reading other reviews on this recipe and it turned out perfect. This is one we will be making often.

This did nothing for me. It was edible but I thought the flavors were way too blah (its pretty bad when the most obvious flavor is the salt you add to "spice" it up a bit).

While we loved the recipe. We made it without the cranberries made with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice 1 lb venison and two squash. We had more filling than squash so I would recommend using 3-4 with what I used. I kept the rest of the proportions the same. The other things I did differently were to add the seasoning mace (which can be expensive but goes a long way and goes well with most soups)and topped it with some shredded parmesean cheese. Overall we will have more of this. I loved it quite a bit but am not a huge fan of venison. We were skeptical at first but the blends work extremely well together. With some tweaks you will ove it too and make it your own.

Didn't have venison so used ground beef. It was excellent! Only needs enough butter to brush across the skin of squash.

I'm a little surprised. I had to add a lot of seasoning to stop this from tasting like dessert or a side dish. My husband raved at the end result though and was pleased with the ground venison. It was an easy enough dish to prepare and open to change-ups though so I'll probably use this as a base recipe again in the future.

I LOVE this unique recipe! Just made it for the first time. I used elk since the local butcher had ground elk and not venison...I diced an onion and sauteed that in a little oil before adding the elk I used a wild rice mix and I doubled the recipe (but left the brown sugar and cinnamon amounts alone effectively halving them). Last night I made the acorn squash according to directions but tonight I actually cut it into fourths and roasted it cut-side up with some olive oil and salt and pepper. I thought that way was much better. Overall it's just such an awesome mix of flavors and not too sweet when the brown sugar is cut in half. I will be making this again for SURE.

Made this dish and my family loved it. Based on other suggestions I only used 1 tbs of butter. Also we don't like sweet dishes so I didn't use any brown sugar. I added some almond slivers and it was perfect!!! Will definitely make this dish again.

Used ground beef instead of venison but otherwise did not change the recipe. I found it very tasty, sweet and filling, with a tart contrast in the cranberries. It looks very attractive too.

I love this recipe. As others have done I cut the sugar by half and I use only about a tsp of butter in each half of the squash. I used dried cranberries cherry blueberry added 3 carrots one yellow onion 2 celery stalks and half a tbsp of fresh ginger sauted. I've made it with kangaroo and with lamb I think any ground meat would be great but something that has a lot of flavour on it's own is the best compliment for the dish.

Made this tonight... I too cut the amount of butter down drastically... the mistake I made was being too conservative with the sugar.... I dont think it needs as much as the recipe states and its only purpose is to cut down on the tartness of the cranberries... next time i'll focus on sweetening the cranberries before I add them to the mix... and i used splenda and ground turkey to make it a bit healthier...

I took a lot of suggestions from you all and had to improvise a few things. I halved the sugar doubled the rice and used hardly any butter. I didn't have any nutmeg so I used only Chinese 5 spice and I didn't have venison so I used lamb instead. Couldn't find fresh cranberries so I reconstituted craisins. My rice cooker sucked at cooking wild rice so I had to cook it a little more when I put it all together to get the rice right. Since I needed more moisture I used the water leftover from reconstituting the cranberries and that worked well.

I did not have venison I wish we did! But since it's not easily accessible unless you have a hunter in the family I used ground turkey it was great it reminded me of thanksgiving in a squash! My husband had never has acorn squash before and he ate 2 halves so it's a good thing I prepared 2 squash instead of 1
