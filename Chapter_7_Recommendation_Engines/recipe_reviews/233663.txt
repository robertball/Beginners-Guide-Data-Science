I had a difficult time rating this recipe because I did not like it but my husband thought it was ok so I am going with his rating. For starters I will say I made this recipe exactly as is with the exception of using 1 cup of regular cheddar 1 cup of reduced fat cheddar & topped with a sprinkling of cheddar instead of parmesan. I made the rest of the recipe as is. I believe the phrase "You eat with your eyes first" is accurate because if it doesn't look good - you won't want to eat it. That is the first problem I had with this recipe. You can't tell from the photo I posted but the pasta is brown and there were clumps of white cottage cheese that did not melt so it almost had a grey tint to the sauce. I like whole wheat pasta in pasta salad but I was not crazy about the taste or texture in this sauce. The sauce did not have a lot of flavor to us and needed some additional seasoning or additional cheese but that would have negated the "healthier" aspect. I wanted to like this recipe but I don't plan on making it again. I think I will save my macaroni and cheese as a periodic indulgence and stick with the real thing.

My wife and I both liked this recipe. Loved the idea of using cottage cheese for the sauce and it worked well.

My 16 year old had been begging for mac and cheese and didn't even realize what a healthy dish this was!

I substituted mozzarella cheese for the cottage cheese just because that's what I had. And I tripled the dry mustard. It's a good dinner when you can make it from what's already in your kitchen.

Very good! I didn't use the "healthy" options because I'm young and invincible. I would use just a little less flour because it had a slightly gritty feel. I would also put in some chopped Spam because it reminds me of my dad. Otherwise quite good and very easy to make

It was very good I added green onions and garlic salt used marble cheese then I topped with stove top stuffing and covered with more marble cheese and some shredded parmesan. Really good taste and side dish!!
