To previous reviewers, the 25 mins was for muffins. If you read directions again, they say one hour for bread.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Unlike many recipes with sugar in them, it comes out more like a "bread" rather than "cake."  It was delicious topped with just a little powdered sugar.  Like other reviewers, I only used 1 tablespoon of both cinnamon and vanilla.

Poor recipe was rayed one * so  I had to try it out!! I don't jnow any quick bread or bread that takes "25 minutes" so I kept an eye an a toothpick on it. UPDATE:: After said an done, this recipe was quite good for a low sugar, low fat recipe. I couldn't bring myself to use 3 TBLS of cinnamon an vanilla or measure my zucchini, per se, but it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. Thought the texture was *great* really tried to drain every drop out. Also had the delight in using homemade, reduced sugar, applesauce. It's unfortunate that the first reviewer had to start it off with such a downcast appearance. Def deserving of more than 1 star!! ~thank you for sharing

I did not realize it did not have sugar.  Applesauce is a substitute for oil not sugar.
I wasted a good deal of money on product and time and it had a terrible flavor.

Better luck next time I guess.. :(

The recipe did not call for sugar.  I would assume you add at least 2 cups.  Wish I had gone ahead and added it before making the bread.  Otherwise, it had good texture and moistness.

I used whole wheat pastry flour and 1/3 c agave nector, also reduced cinnamon and vanilla. Thie texture was excellent and not sweet at all. The comments from family was that it was not sweet enough but had good flavor and texture. Will make again for sure and add more sweetness so i keep my fans happy.

I started making the recipe and then I realized that the reviews were not good. I was already deciding on making half the recipe    I followed the recipe  except I halved  everything  with the following exceptions: I only used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, two small eggs,  but I did use about 2 cups of shredded zucchini and I did not drain.  My zucchini seemed rather on the dry side anyway   I also used 1 tablespoon of butter. I added one cup of sugar    I baked it at 325 for one hour and it came out fantastic.   I have made zucchini bread in the past without it being this good. I will always recommend reading the reviews before you get started.

If you compare this recipe to several others, you will find that it should be three teaspoons of cinnamon. I made as per the ingredients and ended up throwing it away!

Super moist. Maybe add a little more sweetness than just the applesauce. I am a diabetic so I added the equivalent of 1/2 cup of Truvia to the recipe. The recipe makes two generous loaves one to give or freeze. I would definitely make this  recipe again.

It looks nice and yummy! I didn't notice when I read through the recipe that it didn't call for sugar. I made it but nobody will eat it! It has absolutely no sweetness to it. It's not that moist either, butter wouldn't make it slide down any easier. I'm sorry, I don't like to tread on toes but this recipe won't make it into my oven again and I am a diabetic and use to not so sweet stuff.

If you're looking for a traditional zucchini bread recipe, this one isn't it. But it is a tasty, low fat, low sugar bread that hits the spot. It doesn't last long at my house.

This bread was bland.  It could have used some sugar to give it a boost.  The best part of this bread recipe was using applesauce instead of oil.  If I make it again I'll do quite a bit of modifying to the recipe.

I baked it 90 minutes to get it done and it was super moist. 
I did add 1C sugar which, I know, goes against what the recipe intended.  
I also added 1C chocolate chips. 
We all liked it.

Never did fully cook (still raw in the middle after 1.45hrs).  Tasted awful, no flavour at all,

I did add some sugar to this, but other than that I made it as written.  The bread fell apart.  The bottom and edges were burnt and the middle was not cooked, even though I left it in the oven for 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for (and my oven usually cooks things FASTER than recipes call for).  The flavor of the cooked parts of the bread was actually really good, but all in all, this was a waste of money.  I reall, loved the flavor and wish I could figure out a way to make this again without the burnt, undercooked parts.

There was no flavor.  I usually read reviews before i try something but i didn't on this one. It's missing a very important ingredient like SUGAR!  I would NOT recommend this recipe

I did not care for this recipe. I did not like the texture or taste.
