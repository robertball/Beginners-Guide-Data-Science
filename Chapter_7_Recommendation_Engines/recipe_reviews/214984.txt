I followed the recipe exactly and to be honest it tasted like spaghetti sauce that was missing something.  I have a lot left over and am going to try to doctor it up with more hunks of vegetables and maybe some red pepper flakes.  Sorry, I was really disappointed.

very good soup, I used roasted onions and red peppers.  Made a lot of soup, enough to freeze some.  Highly recomend.

I made several changes to the recipe.  Maybe the most important one was leaving out the last small canned of diced tomatoes- I didn't want to overwhelm the red pepper flavor, and I think it worked.  I also left out the celery, just because I despise celery.  Added fresh basil and oregano and just a touch of crushed red pepper flakes. Lots of salt and black pepper.  Used freshly grated Parmesan.  I have not yet tried it with the tortellini, though I plan to.  Yum!
