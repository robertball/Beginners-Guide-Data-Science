Just made these, they are so delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any coconut so I used some chopped up almonds in place of the coconut.  I also left out the salt and they were still very delicious.

These were delicious!  I didn't add the salt and used sweetened coconut because that's all I had on hand.  I was a bit leery about making these since I'm not a huge fan of dates but the flavors that come through most distinctly are the cocoa and peanut butter.  Even my 1-year-old enjoyed it!

Really delicious! I used almond butter instead of PB. This is a great option for a high protein sweet treat.

I made these bars, didn't come out sticky, but maybe I mixed it too long.  Besides that these bars are awesome, instead of six bars, I cut mine into smaller pieces and gave them to some very picky 6 and 7 year old girls and they devoured them without a problem.  Thank you very much for this recipes.  This is a new school and home favorite and the bonus is there is no sugar and kids think they are eating chocolate!

I subbed carob powder for the cocoa.  There was no stickiness to these!  Without a food processor, I just finely chopped the dates, and mixed everything together, then shaped into balls.  Delicious!

Made according to the recipe and it is very good.  Place in center of large piece of parchment, fold up the sides and chill, then cut into squares.  

Also made a batch with dried Kalamata figs, almond butter, coconut, roasted almonds and 2 scoops vanilla protein powder.  Excellent!

One tip:  spritz your processor and blade with non-stick spray for easy clean-up.

I've made this recipe twice, using Jif Creamy PB. both times omitting the coconut & salt.  The first time I used Sunsweet Whole Pitted Dates.  Even though I didn't over mix, the mixture came out dry.  I added a little extra PB, & that seemed to help.  The bars turned out great, & were consumed quickly.

So, today I made the second batch using Sunsweet Chopped Dates.  These dates were obviously drier straight from the package (in retrospect probably better suited for wetter mixtures like cookie or muffin batter).  I had to compensate with even more PB, which threw the overall flavor balance off.  Other than using fresh dates (not easy to find where I live, I'd love ideas for how to improve the moistness when using packaged dates.

Absolutely delicious! So healthy & Super easy to make. I am recently off sugar and would now choose to make these instead of a batch of cookies.  Would suggest unsweetened coconut if you can find it.  I made this into balls w/ my cookie scoop and they were not as sticky as I anticipated. I plan to double the recipe next time. Be careful if you are watching  your calories - only pop a few balls a day!  I can see these being addictive for sure.

Everyone in the house gobbled them up! We are all gluten free and this was a very nice, relatively healthy treat!
Before putting the mixture in the pan, I sprinkled coconut flakes in the pan and then pressed the mixture over it. Then I added more coconut flakes on top and pressed in. I also added raw almonds and raw cashews to the mixture.

These are FABULOUS!  I especially like the fact that there is absolutely zero sugar. I never thought of using dates to sweeten my treats but you've sure made a believer out of me!  Yum, yum, yum!

This recipe can easily be made low in sugar.  I used unsweetened coconut and Trader Joe's all natural crunchy peanut butter.  The dates are a natural sugar with a high amount of fiber.  This was great!  Not too sweet and satisfies the chocolate craving!  Thanks for sharing.

Super delicious treat!!  My sis, my husband and I gave up having anything with added sugar for 30 days (started the 1st).  I was really needing a treat besides fruit and this recipe did the trick.  Super tasty.  Hopefully other people that have made this used peanut butter without sugar and unsweetened coconut...I can only imagine how sweet it is if they didn't.  I'm not a fan of dates normally, but all you taste in this in chocolate and peanut butter, with a nint of coconut.  SO DELICIOUS!  I can survive without sugar forever, now that I have found this. Great recipe!

When I tried the recipe as is I found the peanut butter overpowered everything else (maybe because I used all natural peanut butter?). I ended up adding an extra cup and a half of dates (I used whole honey dates instead of chopped regular), double the coconut and cocoa and approximately 1 tbsp of unrefined coconut oil to keep it moist. I needed a large batch anyway so it worked out well. They were delicious and I will definitely make them again!

Very good. Instead of putting the coconut in the food processor, I formed the mixture in to balls and rolled them in the coconut. They look a little nicer this way :)

Such a great protein based snack to grab-n-go! I have made these 3 times now and will always keep a supply in my fridge. It's a great alternative to protein bars that you buy in packages. I like that it's made with natural ingredients. I used organic peanut butter without high fructose corn syrup. And i use sweetened coconut. The family likes it too!

I used whole pitted dates, almonds instead of coconut.
Tried to coat with coconut but not sticky enough. Used a commercial food processor. Tried adding more Adams peanut butter to no avail. Tasty but really messy to make and poor presentation.

Love this recipe!  I have also tried it with figs instead of dates and it is delicious.  to combat dryness, I add 1 tsp vanilla.

I have made endless batches of these and everyone that tries them asks for the recipe. I cut the cocoa powder by 1 tbsp to make a less chocolate flavoured bar.  Have tried with sea salt (sweet and slightly salty) and with out the sea salt (more PB/cocoa flavour). Both ways are very good.
Look for a brick of dates that you can chop.  Not as sticky then.  
I roll the bar out between 2 pieces of wax paper, place in fridge and then slice with a pizza cutter.  I'd love to eat a full serving of them but who really needs that much.  This allows smaller bars to be cut.

Delicious and rich!  I used dark cocoa and crunchy natural peanut butter.  I was concerned that it needed a little additional sweetness so I added ~1 Tbsp turbinado sugar - next time I will skip this as it doesn't really need it.  I used a tsp measuring spoon and shaped the mix into 36 smalls balls.  I rolled them in very light confectioners sugar as well to take away some of the stickiness.  Made this way the balls are 1 point each on Weight Watchers or 3 points for 2.

I made these today because I was given 2 huge boxes of dates, which I love. I found the recipe easy and straight forward, the mixture comes together nicely and cuts easily after refrigeration. They are very peanut buttery but very tasty. I only had sweetened coconut so I think on a second attempt, I will use slightly less peanut butter, and unsweetened coconut. Good though, good !

I wouldn't agree that there is NO sugar in these, as the chopped dates are generally coated in sugar, commercial peanut butter has added sugar, and packaged coconut is usually sweetened.  But they are excellent, and a much healthier choice than the traditional no bake cookies which have lots of butter & sugar in them.

I have wanted to make these for a while now but have no food processor, so I used my hand crank chopper/mixer.  My children attend a peanut-free school so I had to substitute sun nut butter for the peanut butter.  They did not stay together as well as I think they might have if I had a real food processor, so I formed them into balls - but they tasted great and my kids loved them!  Definitely in the school lunch rotation.

I think these are great and easy to adjust according to taste. Next time I'm going to up the dates or reduce the PB- also might reduce the cocoa. Skipped the salt. Wondering what a banana would do? Or some raisins? Think you can do some fun things!

This is delicious. I made pretty much as instructed but omitted the salt and just pulsed in the coconut and a cup of macadamia nuts at the end. I sprinkled some coconut over the top and pressed in to add some eye appeal.  One reviewer’s tip to use cooking spray on the food processor for an easier clean up was much appreciated.  Will definitely make again.

It did not look at all like the picture!!  It was so dry when eating.  Will not make them again.

This was the first time I made this recipe. They taste delicious but I think if I were to make it again I need to rework some of the issues I encountered.  My first issue was using natural peanut butter. There was some oil separation so the finished bars were somewhat oily in texture.  The second issue will be easy to fix.  I think  next time I will fold the coconut (and any other additions) in at the very end.

I made as is and I think because I used natural peanut butter that it came out kind of liquidy.   So added extra dates, coconut and a bit more cocoa powder to make it more thick.  Spread into a small pan lined with saran wrap.  They do taste amazing though.

Wow, these taste amazing.  I used Cacao Powder rather than Cocoa as I had 2 packs in my cupboard and didn't know what to use it for so I used it in this recipe.  I used homemade peanut butter to make them.  I will definitely be making these again.

I didn't have coconut so I used walnuts instead. Not bad, but I kinda wished they were more firm. I should have tried freezing them.

I bought dates to make something sweet without processed sugar and came across this recipe. I make peanut butter in my VitaMix, so this recipe had extra appeal. After making a batch of peanut butter, I removed all but 3/4 c. from the container and then added the dates, coconut, and cocoa powder. I then just pulsed for a bit and ultimately just blended all together using the tamper and scraping down the sides. I lined a stone bar pan with enough wax paper to fold over the top and used a mini rolling pin to flatten the mixture. It then went in to the fridge for a bit before I cut it into small squares. It didn't look as lovely as some of the photos, the taste/texture was super! After tasting it, I realized I forgot the salt. Still yummy, but salt would bring the flavors alive, so next batch will have a pinch or so... I will definitely make this recipe when I want sweet in a more "natural" form! Yum!

Just made these. Subbed in raisins for the dates. Left out the salt. Halved the recipe (I was skeptical).  Rolled them into balls. And rolled them in shredded coconut. They taste like chocolate covered raisins. Yum. Perfect treat to lift the spirits. Thanks!

I didn't care for the overpowering PB taste, but was using the all natural "Adams" brand ( isn't that why we try these recipes anyway? To be all natural/healthy?!) I like this idea, though, because of the endless possibilities. My bars never set up as I'd like, but I was using really expensive refrigerated dates. I'll try adding more coconut (because that awesome fruit needs to be tasted) and cocoa. Why not, I'll throw in some rice crispies like someone suggested as well.

The taste was amazing.i used chunky natural peanut butter only after the rest was blended in and that added a bit of crunch. Wonder what it would be like if I left the coconut flaked? Unfortunately, the mixture was sticky, so I had to make balls. Once chilled, they firmed up and disappeared fast!

This was a flop for me.  I made this with Jiffy PB and sweetened coconut because that's what I had on hand.  They never set up after I refrigerated them and they taste more like a rich PB goo.  I used almost the whole box of chopped dates said 1 1/2 C. in box.   Maybe using all the natural stuff would have been the better bet and not sweetened coconut.

These were pretty darn good! I used the Earth Balance coconut and peanut spread instead of peanut butter and made balls instead of bars, which were rolled in a mixture of two parts powdered sugar to one part cocoa.
