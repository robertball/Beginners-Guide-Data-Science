I made this last night – my very first attempt at meringue cookies.  They turned out well!  I only made a half batch since there’s no way I’d eat 4 dozen.  I used Splenda and cherry no-sugar gelatin mix.  Here are my notes:

(1)  I didn’t have parchment paper, but I put them on baking stones and they worked just fine.  
(2)  I had a terrible time with piping them onto the stones, but that’s a testament to my own inexperience with piping, I suspect.
(3)  I made them smaller than the size suggested and it’s a good thing because these are VERY sweet.  They actually do taste a little like cotton candy, as advertised.  
(4)  I shortened the baking time since I had smaller cookies, and took them out of the oven without waiting for them to cool because I was out of time to wait for them.  They’re a little crackled, but still just fine.

These ended up being bright neon pink sweet, crumbly treats.  I read that sugar substitutes wouldn’t let the egg proteins get the stiffness that they need for a proper meringue and, since this is my first try, I’m not sure if maybe it should have gotten more stiff than it did.  But it seemed to work out well in the end and they taste delicious!

I added the entire box of geletin with the one cup of splenda.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla.  I folded in 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips at the end.  I set the oven at 200 and baked for 3 hours then turned it off and let rest in the oven for another hour....Wow these are delicous!  No one would ever know they had spleda in them.  Granted the chocolate chips added some cals to it, but 2 - 3 chips per cookie is nothing.  I can't wait to make with other jello flavors!!!

I just made these, with a couple of small changes; I didn't have sugar free gelatin mix, so one batch I used instant decafe coffee, then made a second batch - divided in half...one half I added fresh grated tangelo (like an orange) rhind, then the second half of the batch, I used poppy seeds and pure almond extract to replace the gelatin flavoring.   The batters were delish, still waiting on them coming out of the oven, I can hardly wait to try them cooked!

These are great, but VERY sweet! Because of this, I strongly recommend making them smaller than golf balls (you can always have more than one!). It seems like most of the negative reviews are from people who don't like Splenda (if you hate it and think it has an aftertaste, why make a recipe where it is an essential ingredient?) or people comparing them to traditional meringues made with sugar. I think we would probably all eat regular meringues instead if that was an option! However, for those of us limiting our sugar intake, these are amazing! BEST OF ALL? They're both sugar-free AND low-carb (something you aren't going to find in sugar-free cookies or candies at the grocery store).

This is the first time I've tried sugar-free meringues, but I really liked them. I'm on a low carb diet and it is difficult to find something sweet and satisfying without giving in and sticking your whole head in a bag of chocolate chips. I used peach flavored sugar-free gelatin and otherwise followed the directions to the letter. The batter is super easy to make (good thing since it takes a while to get results!) and my kids even helped. Just make sure to check on these before the 1.5 hours is up BUT DON'T OPEN THE OVEN DOOR. JUST TURN ON THE LIGHT AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T GETTING TOO BROWN! Taste is yummy, as I don't get the aftertaste using the peach gelatin, and I will be making these many more times :)

For *sugar free* cookies these are great but I wouldn't make them again unless I needed a sugar free cookie.  

I notice that two of the reviewers for this cookie made substantial changes to the recipe so that they are rating a different product.  I made no modifications to this recipe and I found the cooking time to be a little long.   Even in a 250 degree oven they browned a little more than I liked and have a slightly bitter aftertaste a result.  I found  that the large size (0.60 oz) sugar-free Jello box had more gelatin than I needed for this recipe.

I will probably try these again but I will check them before the full 1.5 hours is up.

Weight Watchers delight! I also increased the amount of gelatin but kept everything else the same. Pretty, light, airy and sweet. Entire batch is 2 points on WW. Also made a second batch with PB2 (dehydrated peanut butter) instead of gelatin. oh yum. Entire batch 6 points using 4 TBL of PB2.

Awesome recipe if you're looking to satisfy you sweet tooth with virtually no calories.  I screwed up my first batch by openeing the oven, but the second batch was perfect.  They did have a bit of an aftertaste, so I cut back on the gelatin by a 1/2 tsp. the second time.  My lime cookies are delicious!

Perfect for low carb! I made the strawberry and also made the same recipe and added 1 tsp vanilla then split the recipe in half and added 1 tbs unsweetened chocolate powder. They turned out great.

This was my first attempt at meringue cookies and I must say it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The only thing is that I thought the after taste was for some reason on the salty side. Maybe a little less salt next time! ***Update- I made these cookies again and this time left out the salt completely. It did not change the structure of the cookie and eliminated the salty after taste mentioned previously. There still is the artificial sweetener after taste present but I can get past that (especially when I'm craving something sweet and watching my carbs)!

Look really cool and great idea in theory - using lots of different colors & flavors, etc.  But unfortunately, I did not care for the taste.  Kind of like salty cotton candy.

These cookies are great!  I did not use jello but added 1/2 tsp of coconut flavoring then I made 48 cookies and sprinkled 4 tbsp of unsweetened coconut over the 48 cookies and added three sugar free chocolate chips to each cookie.  They are excellent. I figure they are less than two carbs each.

I made these today and my son, who is on the Atkins diet loved them.  He said they have the texture of pork rinds but melt in your mouth like cotton candy.  I followed the directions exactly but didn't have any star attachments so I just squeezed the cookies right out of the 1/4" slot I made in the gallon zip-lock baggie.  I've eaten three and they are pretty tasty.  I made the strawberry flavored ones.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

WAY too much salt...would have been great without it or even with less salt. Will cut it back to a pinch next time...otherwise, interesting cookies.

These cookies have just saved my life! I have been so craving sweet things... I tried it with the white chocolate jello and it was boss. For sure very sweet, but amazing. It reminded me of Angelfood Cake but in cookie form.

I made this with lemon instead of strawberry flavored sugar free Jello. It was a crumbly puffy airy mess to eat, but the recipient loved the desert. The cooking was easy to follow and made a large amount. While I did not particularly like them, I made them for a family member who was not allowed sugar, flour or starches. He immediately hid them from the rest of the guests. It is a recipe I will make again without any changes beyond trying different Jello flavors.

I loved this.  My family devoured them.  Next time I will cut back a little in the salt but I think that is a preference issue rather than a fault in the recipe.

we just made these as the recipe is written and in our opinion The Jell-O makes them taste not so delicious... The strawberry flavoring tastes like nestle strawberry quik mix with that cheap imitation strawberry flavor.  I think using an extract would be much better and not add any extra sugar to the mix either since it's alcohol.  They're edible but not 5 star great.  Splenda of course has that sickly sweet after-taste too that can be off-putting for some as well.

The texture of these cookies was really great. But I can't believe I'm the only one who couldn't stand the flavor. They tasted like nothing but that awful Splenda aftertaste. I guess if that doesn't bother you, you're in luck!
