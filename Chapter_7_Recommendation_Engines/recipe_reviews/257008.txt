I made two different turkey muffins with this being one of them. I was originally partial to this one due to it not calling for an egg and using Stove Top over breadcrumbs. While these were good, I do feel something was missing. I think a handful of shredded cheese thrown in the mix would bump these up a notch. Overall though, good recipe and one I would make again.
