I find salmon rich enough and so I don't use the butter.  Instead I brush with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.  Or you can brush with balsamic dressing (Renee's is nice).  I wash and freeze my cilantro which makes it very easy to chop finely and it is "wilted" and perfect for the recipe so you don't have to sautee in butter.  For colour I like to add a couple of thinly sliced rings of red pepper.  Voila! lower in fat - no trans fat from the butter and pretty too!!

Excellent!  I too thought butter might be too heavy so I brused the salmon with olive oil and squeezed fresh LIME juice ..it only compliments the cilantro and jalepeno flavor..yummy!

We LOVED this fish.  I am just starting to eat salmon and I was so impressed with it.  I was afraid that the jalepeno would over power the fish but it didn't.  We are usually stuck with chicken and beef recipes and have been trying to branch out a bit this recipe will definatly become part of our regular menu.

I love salmon, and I love cilantro so I figured I couldn't go wrong here!  Good recipe, I used this jalapeno "relish" stuff (which includes chopped onion & red bell pepper)that takes up residency in my fridge, and that worked out great for this recipe.  I would recommend adding some garlic.  Thanks T&J!

This was a wonderful recipe. Was a little worried that the peppers would be too much when I made the sauce but poured the extra over the Salmon tasted excelent. I also baked mine since it was raining. Cooked it about 30 min on 350 turned out great. Will be adding the the menu

Loved, loved, loved this dish.  Couldn't bring myself to add the jalapenos but it was wonderful.  The melted butter with the fresh cilantro was the perfect combination with this fresh fish.  I just couldn't see adding the peppers.  I also omitted the Old Bay seasoning and used the juice of a fresh lemon, garlic powder and sea salt to season the fish.

My husband, 9 and 10 year old granddaughters and myself loved it. I used butter (didn't think it made it to heavy), added some lemon juice (didn't have limes on hand) and generously sprinkled Old Bay over top before baking. Since it was wrapped in foil, didn't think I'd get any benefit from the charcoal grill, so I baked it for 20 minutes at 350. Will definitely make it again and recommend it to others.

I changed this  alittle bit. I used oil instead of butter and added garlic and 1 tab lime. Than I put this in the blender and marinated it for 4 hours. This was very good and did not over power the salmon.

Delicious! The jalapeno added nice flavor. I went with 1 T butter and 1 T olive oil for my one pound of salmon- turned out fine but i could go w/ even less. I used Tony Cachere's seasoning as I don't have old bay and it was great!

I am not a huge fan of fish and am always looking for recipes that I like because fish is so healthy, and this recipe is wonderful.  My family loved it!  Using some of the suggestions, I added the juice of one lime, canned jalepeno because I did not have fresh, some fresh garlic, and Tony Cachere's Creole Seasoning because I did not have Old Bay.  Grilling on the foil made it so easy, too.  We will have this again!

Really unimpressed with this recipe. I love cilantro and jalepeno's so I thought I couldn't go wrong - just tasted really 'off' for lack of better description.

I also substituted olive oil and I used a jalapeno that I had previously roasted on the grill for a smokier flavor.  Used garlic salt since I didn't have Old Bay.  Very good and easy.

Awesome. I didn't want to use butter so I just put the cilantro and jalapeno on the salmon and then drizzled with a little olive oil. Loved it. Thanks! :)

I grilled the salmon for 15 minutes with only olive oil, pepper and the old bay seasoning.  I put the butter, cilantro and jalapeno sauce on after removing the salmon from the grill.  IT IS SO GOOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

This was so good. the flavor combantions  were excellent, tangy and spicy all rolled into one, yet just suttle enough to let the flavor of the salmon come threw as well. this is  one recipe that we will be making again and again.

I was very impressed with how good this recipe turned out with little prep work and a short, simple ingredient list! The only change I made was to cut the butter in half. I would even increase the cilantro and jalapeno next time, not that it was short on flavor, but just because it suits my personal taste. I was not shy with the Old Bay, and I didn't feel like it needed any extra salt or garlic. I tried it with a squeeze of lime but still prefer a squeeze of lemon with my salmon even with these flavors. But the fish definitely had enough flavor not to need the lemon. I will definitely be making this one again!

What a nice, spicy change for salmon. I don't have Old Bay, so I just used spices I have to try to duplicate Old Bay's flavor. The jalapeno gave a nice kick - I leave the seeds in one of the peppers for more heat. I love the cilantro, too. I prefer using those tubes of refrigerated herbs - it really helps cut prep time down - and the quality and taste is just as good as fresh! I squeeze a generous tablespoon of cilantro in the saucepan instead of using fresh cilantro. I use less butter than it calls for, and next time, probably will use a tiny bit of olive oil instead. I've also used this on tilapia with success! 

***Update 11/2015*** I finally have Old Bay, and it really pulls the recipe together - it's a must for this!

I had a friend over and we were just talking away while I was preoaring the salmon and I forgot the old bay seasoning so after cooking it, it had no flavor.  So I goofed there, but it was a simple recipe to make.

Fantastic recipe. Didn’t need 3lb of salmon so cut the recipe in half. My whole family loved it. Served over a blueberry spinach salad for a summertime dinner.

Simple and great. Made it simpler still..nuke the butter, stir in chopped cilantro and jalapeño, skip the Old Bay (no need), add bit of fresh lime. Don't wilt the cilantro, the hot butter does the job. Brush sauce on grilled fish just before removing from BBQ.

This was SO good tonight. I served this with grilled asparagus and roasted baby red potatoes for a meal that was darn near perfection! A little awkward with the foil and butter when removing from the grill.  Got a little colorful when the butter rolled off the foil and into the fire!  But I think this is by far the best salmon I've ever had and I will be repeating this often.  Didn't change a thing, no need.

Recipe was great will make again with a few variations. I made it like the other reviewers suggested and used a little olive oil instead of the butter. I also chopped up 3 cloves of garlic and since I had green onions leftover I put a few in when I put it on the grill. I don't think next time I will use as much cilantro. My boyfriend and I like the flavor but to messy to eat.Great recipe and a nice variation to just grilling salmon!

Super easy and tasty! I just cooked 2 of the salmon filets for my husband and me but used around the same amount of toppings (cilantro). I didn't use as much butter as it called for and still turned out wonderful. Easy and fast dish- my favorite!

We absolutley loved this! Always trying to find new ways to make salmon and this is our new favorite. So simple with an amazing flavor. The texture of the fish was outstanding, meatier than normal. Not sure why, Ive grilled salmon before but wow, this is a def keeper!

Really good.   I did use olive oil in place of butter.   I chopped the cilantro and jalapeno pepper.   Baked in 425º over for 10 to 12 minutes.

Excellent. We both loved it! And will surely add it to our repertoire. I cut down on the butter and used some oil instead, so as to cater to my non-dairy needs.

After reading several reviews and suggestions, I spread 4 salmon filets with a little olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning, then grilled on a piece of oiled foil.  After the filets were done, I spooned my mixture of a little melted butter, the cilantro and juice from 1/2 a lime.  This was quick and easy, not requiring any advance time for marinating.  I would make this again!  I did not have a jalapeño, but would like to try the recipe with one.

We love this recipe, however, I used Anaheim peppers (1) and I chopped it small and sauteed in butter after the cilantro was wilted  and I continued cooking  for about 3-4 minutes.

This was so easy and simple. I brushed the salmon with olive oil, added salt and pepper, and squeezed a lime on top. For the cilantro sauce I use light butter, but I also added lime juice-this lifted the heaviness of the butter. I did not wrap my salmon in foil, just grilled it on the grate-first grilled skin side down, then separated skin from meat with my spatula, and flipped. Yummy!

I doubled the Jalapeno amount as I grow it in my garden. It's not really hot if you cut out the seeds, but the flavors are wonderful!
I also substituted the butter with 'Smart Balance' to make it a heart healthy, low cal dish.
You'd never know it wasn't butter!
