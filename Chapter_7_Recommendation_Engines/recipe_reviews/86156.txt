I thought this was great! I made mine in a punch bowl and added crushed ice. It was lovely!

I made this recipe for my daughter's 7th birthday. I loved it! Unfortunately, my daughter and her friends didn't like it. I can't figure out why though - it's really a "what's not to like?" punch.

So easy and yummy. We used fruit punch flavor and it was yummy.
