I made this today and it was GREAT. I didn't have pine nuts, so I used walnuts instead. It's so simple to put together and tastes like it came from a gourmet restaurant. It definately isn't missing a thing, but if you insist on a parmesan style mix-in, nutritional yeast would work great, although I think it's perfect the way it is. I served it tossed with fettucini and slices of a homemade "French Baguette" (from this site). Also, it says it takes 30 minutes, but I had it made in less than 10 minutes.

Yum, the addition of sun-dried tomatoes makes for a very good pesto!  I'm not vegan, so I used this pesto on pasta with added parmesan.  I also added the zest and juice of a lemon (I like the taste of lemon with pesto).  Thanks for the recipe!

Yesterday was my first day trying out the vegan diet. I choose this recipe and love being a vegan thus far! I added a bit of parsley and used walnuts instead of pine nuts.  It was delish! I will try to use roasted garlic next time, so the garlic breath doesn't last forever...

This is also very good with walnuts instead of pine nuts - they blend really well with the rest of the flavors

My family and I loved this recipe. The sun-dried tomatoes make this a unique and distinctive pesto. Plus, it's vegan!

This was easy and excellent.  My husband and two young boys loved this (to my surprise!).  One of my sons is gluten, casein, and soy free, so this meal worked perfect for him.  He actually asked when we could have it again.  Made it exactly how recipe stated.  It has a mild flavor, which worked well for us because of the kids.  Will make extra next time for freezing!

This is delicious.  I'm not vegan, but I chose this recipe because I had everything listed in the ingredients.  I scaled it down to 1 serving since I don't know how well it would keep, and it was plenty (more than enough, actually!) for what I needed it for (Vegetarian Open Faced Sandwiches on here).   I don't have a clue why this recipe says it takes 30 minutes; I was done in 5.   I love the flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

It turned out great! I used about a cup of basil, more tomatoes and garlic and it was perfect for my kinda taste. Also, I didn't have any olive oil left, so I went for vegetable oil as a last minute alternative and it still worked :)

Everyone loved this! Pesto is just so good, but the tomatoes made it even better. Did half pine nuts and half walnuts and just guessed at my measurements on the basil and tomatoes. It's a forgiving recipe (as long as you come somewhere close to the requested amounts); made a great spread for my herb bread.

I added parmesan and left out the garlic (so that it would last longer in the fridge).  Delicious and fresh tasting!

This was amazing! I've never made any type of pesto before, and it turned out delicious! Will definitely be making this again. I didn't follow the recipe exactly (used more tomatoes, less basil) but it seems like a pretty failproof recipe. Thank you so much!

Really good, but could be even better. Next time I will use only 1 clove of garlic and 5 tbs pine nuts. I didnâ€™t have any sun-dried tomatoes so I used roasted red peppers, which was also good. Either would work well. I will make more next time. This only yeilded 1 1/2 servings. I guess I like a lot on my pasta!

Made this for the Pesto Pasta with Chicken recipe & didn't need to add tomatoes to chicken recipe because they were already in the Pesto. Very good, & quick meal during a busy week.

I really liked this pesto!  The addition of the sundried tomatoes gave it a real boost in flavor.  I had tried another pesto recipe that called for parmesan cheese and I found it a bit greasy.  This one was perfect.  I did decrease the garlic to one big clove and that was enough for me.

Great pesto recipe!  Not a vegan, so I served it with cubed chicken, broccoli, rotini pasta with parm sprinkled on top.  Delicious and easy to make.

This was very good! I subbed walnuts for the pine nuts.  I liked the flavor from the sundried tomatoes - I used three, but they seemed kind of large to me.  Had some mixed with cream cheese on my toasted bagel this morning - delicious!

I've been looking for a vegan pesto and this one is great.  We all really enjoyed it.  The only thing it needed was more salt and some freshly ground pepper.

When I make vegan pesto, I add olives as a sort of replacement for the parmesan. It needs that extra saltiness.

Loved it! So satisfying. Amount of basil (2 cups) confused me - packed or unpacked? So I "slightly" packed them, then decided it was too basily. I doubled tomatoes and garlic, and added a few more pine nuts, and it was perfect for me.

We were having friends over who are vegans, and this was a hit both with them and for us.  I added a couple of roasted red peppers since I ran out of the tomatoes, used walnuts in stead of pine nuts (on a budget here) and squeezed in a bit of lemon juice just for brightness.  I mixed in some parm into the leftovers and that was yummy as well.

I used raw almonds instead of pine nuts and toasted them. I did sprinkle a about a tablespoon of parmesean cheese in the end and squeezed some lemon juice on top.

This "Vegan Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto" is seriously yummy! OMG! It was all I could do to stop eating it before my noodles were cooked. I substituted almond butter for the pine nuts because I didn't have time to go to the grocery store. Thank you Shaun for sharing your recipe.

This was a nice pesto recipe! I didn't have pine nuts so I used walnuts instead.
