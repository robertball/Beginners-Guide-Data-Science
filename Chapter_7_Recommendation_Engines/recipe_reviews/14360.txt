This salad was outrgaeous!!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as indicated, however, I did blanch the broccoli for a few minutes. This gave it a bright green color and nicer texture.
For those people who are concerned about fat grams, follow these simple steps: substitute some water for the oil in the dressing, use 1 TBS of butter for sauteeing, and used baked ramen noodles instead.Another option would be simply sprinkle them on top without frying them at all. Thank you for the recipe!!!

The taste was, indeed, "the best".  One of the all-time best salads I have ever made or tasted! However, when I later checked the nutritional information, I was appalled to see that this salad has almost 600 calories and 50 grams of fat PER SERVING!!!!  That's terrible!  As much as I loved this salad, I probably won't make it again, because of the terrible nutritional value.  So sorry, that's for sure!

This recipe was so simple to make & delicious.  I purchased pre-cut & washed romaine lettuce & pre-chopped walnuts to make it even speedier. Since I was taking this to a friend's house I kept the vegetables, dressing, & roasted walnuts/noodles separate from each other & assembled it all right before dinner. By the end of dinner the entire salad was gone!

This salad is quite addictive! I substituted almonds for the walnuts, and added balsamic vinegar to the dressing. I also put some chopped carrots and some bean sprouts, since I had them around. Cutting the oil in half made this a *little* lower in fat.I will definitely make this again!

Very easy and delicious! It makes ALOT of dressing so I didn't use all of it. Just an FYI - leftovers are not as good as the next day because the crispy noodles get soggy.

This salad is my new favorite! Excellent! Made it for 4th of July picnic and it was devoured!! Yummy! I also added some cooked chicken once for a light lunch salad. My family loved it! I honestly can't tell you HOW GOOD this salad is, or how many times I have been asked for the recipe....I SWEAR I would eat it every day. YUMMMMMMMMM. It is my staple for church potlucks, etc.

This is an all-time great salad. I have substituted pecans for the walnuts and it is just as good. I take copies of the recipe every time I make it for a putluck, because I'm always asked!

This salad was absolutely delicious! But I had to make some changes to make it lower in fat and sugar: I used Splenda instead of sugar, omitted the ramen noodles and butter. I toasted the walnuts in the microwave by itself for a couple of minutes, then added a little cooking spray and sprinkled some Splenda on it, and let it cool it down before adding to the salad. The green onions really gives a nice flavor to this salad. Thanks!

I used light soy sauce (to reduce sodium), but added 1 additional teaspoon for more asian flavor. Sauted broccoli with the green onions in 1tb olive oil (no butter). Removed and cooled in fridge. Heated the crushed ramen in same pan (no additional oil/butter needed). I left out the nuts; ramen was crunch enough that you dont miss them. Very good. Way too much dressing!! I added a little bit at a time until the lettuce was lightly coated and stored the rest of the dressing for a later time.

Our Christmas crowd of 21 really enjoyed this salad.  I tripled lettuces and had some left, but only doubled the dressing and had some left over.  Wondering if I could use sugar substitute (like Splenda) in the dressing and might try that next time.

I loved this salad, though I did make some changes. I used only 1/4 cup oil and the rest water. I used 1/3 cup splenda instead of sugar and I added ginger and garlic powder to add some flavor.  I left out the butter altogether. I substituted almonds for walnuts. I used cooked broccoli. It was so flavorful and yummy!

I just finished eating this delicious salad.  I did sub fresh orange slices and dried cranberries for the broccoli and onion.  I also mixed the dressing and the un-fried crushed ramen noodles for a few minutes before tossing with the lettuce.  The salad dressing is one of my favorites!

Wonderful, versatile salad. You can mix and match various greens, I used Romaine and Arugula. Add any fruit such as peaches, mandarin oranges, or even fresh oranges like I did. I prefer pecans and almonds to walnuts so I subbed that as well. Yummy !!

Most excellent.  The recipe makes too much dressing, so use sparingly.  But it's quite yummy.  The kids loved the idea of the ramen crunchies.  Make sure you don't forget the green onions....it was the perfect flavor.

Lovely salad.  Great dressing.  Had to omit the nuts due to an allergy and added thin slices of red bell pepper instead.  I also blanched the broccoli before hand.  The next day it made a great lunch with thinly sliced barbecued chicken breast added to it.

Salads really aren't supposed to be soupy with dressing. Just enough so each leaf or veggie gets a little taste of the dressing. Cut way back on the dressing. It will be lots better and healthier.

Huge hit at book club. Instead of just romaine I shredded mixed lettuce and added a bag of broccoli slaw. I toasted noodles and walnuts the night before to save time.

My oh my oh my!!  This Salad is absolutely incredibly fantastic.  I searched this website high and low for THEE PERFECT salad for Easter dinner and I chose this one and Oh my gosh did it nail perfection.  The dressing is to die for.  The broccoli is the perfect added texture.  The toasted nuts and ramen noodles are a critical ingredient. The add a dimension to the salad that is WONDERFUL. Don't skip that step. I also highly recommend adding mandarin oranges. My only struggle was with the actual toasting part. I started out with the frying pan method but the ramen noodles weren't quite "toasted" enough before the butter started to char a little. So I drained them on paper towels and the toasted them a little more in a 350 degree oven for about 10min and they were evenly browned, toasted and DELICIOUS. Every guest - no joke - raved with every bite. They gobbled up 2nds and 3rds until it was all gone. EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  Men and women both loved it. THANK YOU for the awesome recipe.

This was a huge hit with my family. I sweetened the walnuts by adding sugar and butter to a skillet and browning the nuts with this mixture. Used whole walnuts once and will never do that again.

We liked the taste of the dressing and may add a little grated cheese next time.

Easy and different. I took it to a Potluck and have had to send the recipe to a dozen people. I love the brocolli in it!

I'm so excited when I find a new salad recipe that is easy and delicious.  This is no exception!  The only changes I made was to cut back on the suger and the onion.  Yummy!
