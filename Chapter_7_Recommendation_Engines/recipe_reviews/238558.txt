I was unable to find the Irish style butter, so I don't know how much difference that would have made. I think the sesame oil totally overpowered the taste of the dish. I will make this again, but not use sesame oil.

5 stars for ease! I used mild green chiles and feel like if I had used chiles with a little more heat there would have been another dimension of flavor I felt was lacking. Having the cashew crunch was different but I'm always up for different. My husband liked it too!

This was surprisingly good! My husband raised an eyebrow when he saw the jar of cashews still on the kitchen counter, but I wish I could have taken a picture of the look on his face after his first bite! Something magical happens with the avocado and cashew that makes the flavor so rich and creamy. I used less oil and less cheese and couldn't detect a difference in quality. Also, subbing red chili pepper flakes for the green chilies worked well.

What a lovely dish...quite a hidden gem on allrecipes! I didn't have any green chiles in my pantry (darn it) so I used a bit of chopped up canned jalapeno.Other than that made it exactly as written, including the cashews, which was a great touch. I served it with some picante sauce , chopped cilantro and sour cream on the side. Absolutely delicious. Thank you, Lauren for a recipe that I will be making frequently. Loved it.   : )

This is a great light dinner. I used medium cooked shrimp sliced the long way. Added extra avocado...the broiler makes it creamy. You can use almost any good melting cheese...also regulate heat with just red pepper flakes instead of chilies. I will make again even as an appetizer.
