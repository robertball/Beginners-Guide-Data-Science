Good, quick Vegan meal. I made it as written, accept I finely cut up some ends of gluten free bread and saut√©ed them in vegan butter instead of the panko. I'll be trying this recipe with fresh onions, garlic, rosemary, and tomatoes in the future.

I stuck all the ingredients in a crock pot with an extra cup of water on high for about 5 hours and my whole family loved it. I didn't drain the spinach either, just thawed it a little in the microwave and dumped it in. So. Easy.

Put everything in the crockpot on high along with a few chicken thighs.  Shredded the thighs and added a touch of lemon juice at the end.  Whole family loved it.  Would use chicken broth next time instead of the water.
