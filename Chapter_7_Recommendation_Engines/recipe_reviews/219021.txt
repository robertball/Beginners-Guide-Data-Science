For a little added flavor, brown the kielbasa slices with the onion instead of heating in the microwave. Put a teaspoon or so of caraway seeds in with the kraut. Sur Gut!!!

Was completely delicious. I wasn't totally sure about the apple, but oh yes. I didn't make my own spaetzle but rather used some store bought, and mine ended up a little dry, but that very well might have been my fault as the ratios might have been off. So next time I would probably reserve some of the pasta cooking liquid. But totally delicious!  I am thinking of including this as a side on Thanksgiving :)

Served with wheat beer and hard pretzels with mustard, ah-mazing!

I was very leary about this dish. I picked it on a whim, and the whole time cooking it doubted it.  However.... I was totally wrong and it was a complete hit!!! I used the Cost Plus World Market Spaetzle to save on time, and maybe used too much cause felt it needed more sauce, but something for me to play with.  This was delicious all the way through and my boyfriends family and I LOVED IT!! Will definitely making it again! Oh, didn't have a gala apple so use one that looked similar to it (sorry I can't remember the name of it) but it worked just as good!  And one more note, I hate sauerkraut, but in this dish... i could eat it all day!

Where oh where did I go wrong. I've made a dish very similar to this for years that everyone loves, but this one no one liked. I found it to be a lot of work as written and the sauerkraut over powered everything good in this dish. Such a shame. I've made sp√§tzle before, but it's been years and I know I messed it up. My pot of water was not large enough to accommodate the noodles so I wound up with a mushy mess, although they did taste good on their own, they were lost in this dish.  It would have been nice if the recipe specified how large a pot or how much water to cook the noodles in, however being an experienced cook I should have known better. Anyway, my second problem was with the sauerkraut. I always rinse and drain mine, but because the recipe didn't say this I opted to put the kraut in as is. I know some people do not rinse because they like the full flavor of the kraut. I wrongly assumed this was the intention of the recipe. So, color me stupid. At least that's how I felt. If I were to make this again I would do it my way. First, saute everything in one pan, bacon, onion, kielbasa, then apple, butter brown sugar. Rinse and drain the kraut and add that to the pan and simmer it all to blend the favors. When done, throw in your noodles. I personally like kluski, but I've even used egg noodles in a pinch, or go ahead and make the spaetzle and stir it all together for a few minutes and serve. No reason to dirty a bunch of pans or casserole and no need to use the oven.

I made my own Bavarian style kraut and used a honeycrisp apple instead of a gala. I also browned the kielbasa in the bacon drippings instead of using the microwave. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty close and it turned out great! Will definitely make this again!

This is DELICIOUS!!! Wonderful! I was just looking for a Kielbasa and Sauerkraut recipe. Made my own home made Sauerkraut last year, so looking to use some up and had some Polish sausage in the freezer, too. Made this, it is excellent! For the first try, I skipped the butter, apple and brown sugar because I was a little unsure about that. I didn't want to go for sweet right away. Now the next time I make this, I will try it with the apple, butter and brown sugar, maybe, because I think the flavors would blend famously! Excellent dish! Really happy I tried it! I will not here the Spaetzle was a new try for me, I have not made Spaetzle before, so I think it turned out but I will try other methods. Like I said, I hadn't made Spaetzle before so not sure what to expect. Just the same, it turned out great and the dinner was a hit with the family!!! :)

I can't wait to try this one. I'm going to used the imported Spaetzle I bought at World Market but I'm sure the homemade is better. Thanks for posting the recipe.
Edit: it was good; but a little more bland than I was expecting; you'd think with apples and brown sugar and onions and kraut that there would be an explosion of flavors ; may have to add to it next time. But it was a tasty meal.

I took this to a potluck and it didn't go over well, but when I tasted it I decided it was okay...more for me! The sauerkraut was a little on the sweet side for my taste, but that is a matter of taste. Otherwise I thought the whole package was perfect.

OMG. so good. Even my picky 10y/o liked it.  The only thing different that I did was cook all (except spaetzle) all in the same pan.  Started with bacon and onion...added butter, Apple and brown sugar... Sauerkraut and sausage.  Once everything was in the pan to cook together... I started the oven, oven ready, all went into the baking pan on top of spaetzle and I baked for 25 minutes...  Will definitely make this again

Have made this a few times, using Field Roast apple sage sausage (I'm vegetarian).  One addition, is that we put a few slices of swiss cheese on top of the spaetzle before putting the kraut mixture.   AMAZING

My husband loves this dish. I buy frozen spaetzle and go easy on the sauerkraut, otherwise it can overwhelm the dish. Between the butter, kielbasa and bacon it can get a bit greasy, but tastes quite good.

This casserole was loved by all. I too was apprehensive about adding the apples, so I compromised by making them and putting the on the side.  I did not care for the added sweetness of the apples, but mom and another guest loved it.  I have never made Spaetzle before and oh my goodness, it is so easy!  Little dd I know my mom had her mother's Spaetzle maker which was just handed down to me!  I had so much fun making this casserole.  I think this would be a great recipe for a crowd as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Dished turned out great. The only change I made was browning the Kielbasa with the onions and I added mushrooms.

Wow! The flavor! Got my 3 under 8yrs kids to eat this! Took advise of two others: cooked kielbasa in pan, added 1/2tsp caraway to sauerkraut when cooking.

I omitted the sugar as I felt the apple gave it enough sweetness to offset the tartness of the kraut.  I used peppercorn bacon and added a few more slices.  After frying the bacon I drained off some of the grease and softened the onions and added everything else back to the same pan.  Wished I would have made homemade spaetzle as the store bought just didn't cut it.
Gave the kraut a quick rinse under the faucet and drained well.  Would have also preferred a little more liquid. Very good flavor.

Love, love, love this! I just changed up one thing. I mix it all together instead of layering it. Everything is already together. Some of the noodles might get crispy, but that‚Äôs OK!

Good basic recipe .  Used two large Gala apples, additional brown sugar,  and butter. 

We're not bacon people here, but saved the very pure pork sausage fat cooked off from breakfast and used a couple spoons again to caramelize the onions... 
 
Fun to make and, both my Husband and myself enjoyed the meal.

This was amazing.  I used Oktoberfest sausage.  I part grilled them first then cut them up and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients before I put it in the oven.  Will definitely make this again.

My husband had never eaten sauerkraut before and was worried I was going to ruin the sausage with a form of uneatable cabbage.  I assured him this was not a German variation of a Korean recipe.  
This made a believer out of him.  This is a keeper!
The apple adds a sweetness that doesn't overpower the sour of the kraut.  It's a mixture of textures and flavors that really works well together.
I would not hesitate to serve this to friends and family.

Was so much better than expected. I used store bought Spaetzle, although homemade is so much better.

Delicious, didn't have time to make spaetzle, used orzo instead.  It was a good enough substitute.  I used 2 apples and added peas.   Also, I would never cook meat in a microwave- the stovetop to cook the kielbasa was the perfect choice.

I followed the recipe exactly for ingredients. I usually make my own "dumplings" and I did this time too, but I like mine a little larger than putting them through a colander, so I just use two spoons and work with it into the water. I think I could have used a few more spatzles. I liked this recipe a lot. I would make it again. I also used the bacon grease to cook the kraut and apples and added just a little butter so it wouldn't burn. Did seem like I used a lot of pans to get this done.  I browned the sausage in the frying pan before I added it to the casserole. I like it that way.

This was just weird. Way too much effort for a pretty unimpressive dish, and an off-putting combination of flavors, to be honest. Considering how many pans I had to dirty, and that kielbasa is so tasty all on its own, this is definitely not something I will make again.
