My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add a few things to add a bit more zip.  I added some dry mustard to the butter/flour minture.  When i fried the bacon i added some minced garlic and finely diced onion.  This recipe doesn't call for salt but i am glad i added it.  It really brought all the flavours together. Although this is a simple recipe and easy to make, be prepared for lots of cleanup (lots of dishes):).  I would definately make this again...its a keeper.

Oh my gosh.. this is one of the best recipes I have found on this site. I do not make any variations and it's delicious. One suggestion would be to not fry the canadian bacon too long because I have done that and it's not as good when those peices are chewy or hard,I use the little 50 cent sized canadian bacon thats made to put on pizza.

My girlfriend and I both loved this recipe. I used a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and it turned out incredible. The Canadian bacon really adds a nice flavor. Very good as leftovers also. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I doubled this recipe. To make this a little more personal, I added a little Frank's Hot Sauce, a couple teaspoons of italian seasoning and another cup of cheese. This is almost like goulash. Doubled recipe, no leftovers. Husband ate what everyone else didn't. I absolutely think double the cheese is crucial. My kids thought canadian bacon in macaroni and cheese was great. Next time, I'll add some sauteed onion/garlic.

My boyfriend found this recipe and made it for me because I was missing food from home.  I have to say that this is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had!  I could eat the entire pot to myself I love it that much. Definetly worth a try!  I have it every few weeks! :)

I liked this recipe but no one els in the family did. It doesn't have a whole bunch of flavor so if you are looking for something that will wow people this isn't it.

When deciding what "side" to make for tonight, my roommate has his heart set on mac n cheese and I had a craving for onion rings (not sure why). Well, we compromised and made both! I have never made homemade mac n cheese but this recipe looked interesting and easy for a beginner. On the first try, I followed the recipe exactly...but after adding the chedded cheddar cheese...it began to get clumpy and greasy. I threw it out and started the cheese sauce again, only instead of cheddar I used american cheese. Well, at least this was creamier but I didn't like it any better. Besides my roommate, who thought this was "okay," no one really liked this. As I was about to throw what was left, my roommate said he'd just eat the leftovers tommorrow at work...which was the only thing that saved these from going in the trash. I attribute the failure partly due to my inexperience in making homemade mac n cheese but I will try to gain experience from other mac n cheese recipes found on this site. Thanks anyways.

This is an excellent recipe.  I also added a bread crumb topping to add a little crunch.

Not a favorite.  Not bad, just not the really yummy comfort food I had hoped for.

I sauteed red onions, garlic, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms with the bacon (I used turkey) and added S & P & garlic salt - yum!  Added milk (1-2 cups) to make a true cheese sauce and used Italian style diced toms after everything was mixed together and topped it with shredded cheese...... Okay base but needs all this to get it to 5 stars. SMELLS Good! TASTES GREAT!

This is yummy! I doubled the recipe and did half marbled cheddar with half emmental. I topped it with more grated cheese (we love cheese!) and baked it in the oven for 15 minutes. It's delicious! Will definitely be doing this one again, the bacon makes it extra special!

The whole family really enjoyed this. We added a breadcrumb topping, as mentioned in another review, and it worked really well. It's a recipe that you can play with a bit too, which is nice. We had it with salad and rolls - great dinner.

This was excellent!  I added some garlic/onions like others had suggested. Also added abit of Tabasco/Worchestershire sauce - along with about a 1/4 thick Greek yoghurt. I topped it off with about 7 Saltines that had been crushed mixed with abit of Mrs. Dash and left over grated cheese. I placed this all into a casserole dish, and cooked for about 30 minutes until it bubbled and topping was brown at 350F.  Served with a side salad - perfect meal for a diabetic gal like myself (am Type 1 of 42 years - like to watch my carbs - but this little "cheat" meal was so worth it!).

I love it! It only took 30 minutes from the start of preparation to the time I sat down to eat. I added a little more cheese than called for and the canned tomatoes I had on hand were seasoned with basil, garlic, and oregano. That gave it a little bit of an Italian flare and it was wonderful!  Definitely will make this quick, easy and very yummy dish again!

i followed the recipe at first, when i added the cheese to the flour/butter mixture it turned into pretty much a solid rock, i added some milk to get the sauce to the creamy texture i prefer. and it turned out good, some salt and pepper would be good for a bit of extra flavor

All was going good until step 3 when i starting mixing it all together, the mix went "ultra" glugly and was hardly eatable, but i saved the recipe by adding bolongse pasta sauce, although then the food had a weird texture, but was still delicous!

For the macaroni and cheese, we used diced tomatoes. I think that it could have been better with a little bit of milk help melt the cheese to make it creamier. Overall, it was a unique and almost Italian twist on the macaroni and cheese we are used to. It is really tasty and I'm sure with a little adjustments it could be a meal everyone could enjoy. Even my mom and my brother loved it.
