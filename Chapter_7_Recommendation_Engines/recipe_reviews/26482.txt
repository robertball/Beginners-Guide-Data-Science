I've made this recipe twice and it was enjoyed by all. One thing you must try is adding cinnamon after adding the butter, it is so much better, add enough to lightly dust the entire thing, add more or less depending on your taste. I forgot to add it in the second batch and everyone said it was missing something and wasn't as good, I realized then that I forgot the cinnamon!

These came out really great with a few minor variations.  I drained and coarsly smashed the canned yams to make them smoother, but also to keep some texture to them.  I mixed yams and brown sugar together and then topped with the butter & marshmallows.  I uncovered the dish about 15 minutes before it was done so the marshmallows would slightly brown.  I used more marshmallows then the recipe called for and I think that along with the smashing of the yams prevented them from melting into the yams too much.  Very tasty!! Another tip...spray the foil with cooking spray before you cover this to prevent it from sticking to the marshmallows.

My first Thanksgiving in charge and this dish was wonderful!  I prepared it ahead of time so I'll give the details in case it helps someone else.  Four large fresh yams (microwaved 20 minutes per a previous reviewer) peeled and cubed (they were almost too soft to cube) fit in a 1 1/2 quart casserole.  I added the butter, sugar and a cup of marshmallows and left it in the fridge.  Nothing I had was cooking at 400, so I tossed it in for 20-30 minutes with some other things at 350, and for another 20-25 at 375.  I left it covered that entire time as I wanted it to heat up, but not burn.  The marshmallows melted in and it was all golden bubbly goodness.  I covered the top with more marshmallows and popped it back in uncovered long enough for the marshmallows to merge and get toasty.  (Just about the same time it takes to brown the french onions on the green bean casserole!)  They held a soft cube form long enough to pick up with a fork, but dissolved the minute they hit your mouth.  Scrumptious!

Second time around, I peeled the yams first and cubed them and steamed them until tender.  It seemed MUCH easier for me than microwaving first and the final texture came out better.  I used too much butter, though, and it was very watery in the bottom.  Or there may be something to using a higher heat to carmelize the sugar.  Still tasted great!

The recipe didn't mention draining the canned yams, so I didn't.  Most of the marshmallows fell into the juice and dissolved, and I ended up with yams floating in a watery juice.  They tasted fine, but looked awful.  Next time, I'll know to drain them.  I think next time I will mash them up, too.

I agree, cinnamon really does give this one an extra punch.  Had the same problem with marshmallows melting all the way through, will try the big marshmallows next time.  One thing to suggest, use a foil pan to cook these in...the cooked marshmallows are really tough to get off your pans!!  But for as easy as this one is I can't believe how many compliments I got on it!!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving-had never made this dish before because I thought I did not like candied yams.  Well either I was missing out or this is just a really good recipe ;-)  I made it again for Christmas.  My husband likes it so much I am making it here in the middle of June!  Be sure to drain the yams before you start.

OK, following everyone's suggestions, I did this:  Take 1 40 oz. can AND 1 15 oz. can, thoroughly drain and mash.  Add 1/2 cup brown sugar and mix.  Sprinkle cinnamon on top.  I put several cubes of butter over top.  This will fit in an 8x8 dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes covered and THEN uncovered with large marshmallows on top for another 10 min.  Marshmallows were golden and made lovely crust.  Everyone raved about this dish and it was devoured right away!

These were great.  The only problem I had was that I forgot to drain the canned yams -- next time, I'll remember!

This dish is absolutely delicious!  The yams just melt in your mouth!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added cinnamon along with the brown sugar and also used freshed yams.  I let it sit in my fridge for about 5 hours so the flavors could blend before adding marshmallows and sticking it in the oven.  I also made sure to spray my aluminum foil with cooking spray so it wouldn't stick to the foil.  After the initial 25 minutes of cooking, I took off the foil and added more marshmallows and let it cook uncovered for another 10 minutes.  The marshmallows got nice and browned and crispy, tasting like the toasted marshmallows you get over a camp fire.  The combination of the marshmallows with the yams was so amazing.  The whole thing just melts in your mouth!!!

OK, I have NEVER liked Candied Yams, but this is with out a doubt THE BEST recipe for them you will EVER find!  I now LOVE them!  I followed the recipe, but then added the cinnamon that a few other reviewers mentioned, and I think that's what sent this dish over the top!  The instructions were easy to follow, it was so simple to make.  I didn't tell my husband that we have leftovers, because by tomorrow morning.... we won't!  
My recommendation????  Don't look further for another recipe.  This is the one! BTW- we had 17 people for Thanksgiving, and this was the side dish everyone raved over.

Other's have stated they did not know to drain the cans, so I was sure to do that, altho the recipe I usually use calls for more liquid. I think the problems people were having with the marshmallows is because the recipe calls to add them at the beginning. I suggest allowing the yams to cook most of the way, about 20 mins and then add the marshmallows with no cover on it. Watch them puff up and get a light golden brown and your done! I also suggest playing around with flavors, cinnamon of course is good, but you can also try adding molasses, orange juice or maple syrup. :)

This recipe was great to use as a GENERAL GUIDE.  This was ,by the way, the best of all the Candied Yams recipes I have found online yet.  
I would make these additions/changes;
~make sure you drain the canned yams
 first
~sprinkle 1/2 tsp of cinnamon before 
 adding the brown sugar
~definetely use less butter (try 1/2 of 
 what the recipe calls for)
~cut the cooking time to 25 minutes 
 (At 25 minutes my yams/marshmellows
 looked so golden, puffy and yummy that
 I was tempted to pull them out early,
 but I decided to follow the recipe.)
  
By the end of the recipes cooking time my marshmellows had all melted away and dissapeared :( Very disapointing!

Great recipe.  I have altered this recipe a bit.  I do not use canned yams.  I buy about 5 to 6 medium to large yams.  I cook the yams then peel the skins off.  I then let the yams cool.  I peel the skins off and then mash the yams with a hand mixer until it looks like a paste.  I use a 9x13 pan to put the mashed yams in.  I cut up pieces of butter and put them on top of the mashed yams.  I then sprinkle brown sugar all over (amount will very depending on the sweetness level).  I then put an entire bag of small marshmallows on top.  Cover the 9x13 pan with foil.  I cooked the the yams at 400 degrees for 25 minutes (what it said in the recipe).  I then uncover the yams to have the marshmallows turn golden brown.

This is a fantastic basic recipe.  Wonderful to build upon based on individual tastes.  I added a tsp of vanilla, a sprinkle of salt and a decent dusting of cinnamon to the sweet potatoes, butter and brown sugar.  I combined them all together in a bowl and then scooped it into a glass Pyrex dish.  Definitely add the marshmallows.  It adds a great sweet crunch when they're toasted.  Spray the foil with Pam before you cover it.  That way the marshmallows don't pull off when you remove the foil.  Also spray the Pyrex dish with Pam.  It helps with cleanup.   I quadrupled the recipe so I could add the leftovers to a pie crust and bake into a sweet potato pie.

This is a good basic recipe, but some things can be done to take it over the top. First, it definitely needs cinnamon! I sprinkled some over top the marshmallows (about 1/2 a tsp as I doubled the recipe).  I also just simmered the butter and sugar and then poured over top the yams for a more even covering. Last, I included a bit of the canned syrup, for extra yam flavor and everyone liked it. I didn't use all of it because then I'd have yam soup! Also, knowing from experience, I know that mini marshmallows can melt too easily so large marshmallows are the way to go in my opinion. Someone mentioned putting in some vanilla extract...that sounds really good and I might just try that next time!

This Recipe is always a hit! I have always said I dont like candied Yams but when I made this recipe and tried it I couldnt get enough. The first time I made it I did add the cinnamon and a little nutmeg and I have made it the same way ever since. Everyone raves about the yams when I make them this way. Just be sure to drain the yams and i always cook them with marshmallows at first then add more marshmallows about half way through.

Candied Yams is one of the few dishes that I actually prefer with canned items. I have tried to make this soul food staple in the past and always ended up with a soggy mess. Thank you to the reviewers who said to DRAIN THE CANS before using them! This came out PERFECT! I remembered the cinnamon after I had already layered the marshmallows(big ones, BTW) so I just sprinkled it on top. Wonderful! Just like my Granny's!

I also made these for Thanksgiving. But i did bake at 350 and covered with foil for 15 mins then I removed the foil  and baked until marshmallows melted alittle and turn just alittle brown. 
I didn't have any problems with mine melting  into the yams.They were GREAT !!! This was a big hit with the family. Even with the picky eaters.

This is how my mom has made these for years. She melts the butter and mixes it with the sweet potato juice, and brown sugar,and adds cinamon. Pours over the sweet potatoes and bakes til hot. Then she adds the marshmallows and ups the temp on the oven to brown them. Same recipe different technique.

Good base recipe.  Adding another can of yams keeps this recipe from tasting too rich...Drained then heated two 29oz cans Bruce yams in pot, mashed coarsely...In small saucepan I melted 1/4c butter & 1/2c sugar together then stirred mixture in w yams b4 smoothing it all into 8x8 pan...Per others' suggestions, I dusted w cinnamon; sprinkled w pecans; topped GENEROUSLY w marshmallows; covered w Spam-sprayed foil...Baked for 15mins, removed foil, watched marshmallows brown quickly...RESULTS: Beautiful presentation, good flavor, not runny at all. My son liked the hint of cinnamon but we'll leave out pecans next time (it just didn't compliment the creamy texture of the dish)...Next batch I'll also keep the yams whole. This was the first time I've ever mashed yams & I have to say I prefer them whole, mashed reminds me too much of babyfood.

I fixed these for some skeptics who pride themselves on their Candied Yams.  They asked me for the recipe.  I did slice them into bite-size pieces and then drained them until dry.  I mixed brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves then sprinkled them over the 1st layer of yams, then followed w/ small butter slices.  I then repeated the process for another layer.  Baked it in a covered nonstick sprayed pan for 20 min, then added the marshmallows and baked uncovered until they were golden.  Voila!

I'm making.. Oops, I mean troubleshooting.. this recipe right now (on thanksgiving) because no where in this -what should have been really simple- recipe did it say that you should drain the sweet potatoes. So instead of having whats in the picture going to my table, I have what amounts to sugary sweet potato soup heading there.


A person shouldn't have to read comments to a recipe, for things that should have been said in the recipe itself. Theres no telling -at all- that it wasn't intended to have all of the liquid, let alone how much liquid from the can should have been drained out in the first place.


Also, aside from all that, the marshmallows didn't get brown what-so-ever being covered, so it needed to be put back in the oven any way to brown those. 


Should have scrapped this idea from the menu all together and given the marshmallows to the kids. This "should be simple" recipe is a complete failure to launch.

I had never made candied yams before, so I didn't know you were supposed to use cans and had instead bought several fresh yams (3 large, 1 smaller). I peeled and cubed them into large chunks, and put them into a microwave-safe casserole dish with 2 Tbsp. water, covered with Saran Wrap, for 15 minutes (kept checking them every 5 min). 

I drained out the water, and added the 1/4c. butter and 1/2c. dark brown sugar, a dash of cinnamon, and then the marshmallows. After cooking it for 25 minutes at 400 degrees, the yams were just heavenly!!! The marshmallows didn't dissintegrate into the yams, which were perfectly tender, and there was no extra liquid in the bottom of the pan...the sugar caramelized nicely.

Thanks to MAMABEAR2TWOCUBS for giving me a starting point for this recipe using fresh yams!

oh so GOOD! First time doing Yams. I followed the recipe as is, but added cinammon after the butter as a reviewer reccomended, and Loved it! Traditional dish for my hubby and I wanted to have a recipe of my own to make for him for the holidays. Just heard him say "oh this is delicious" over and over ;) Definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy recipe to do! I doubled it with 2 large cans of yams in a 9x13 glass dish. Doubled the rest of the ingredients and added about 1 heaping teaspoon of Cinnamon just a dash of allspice. Wonderful flavor and enjoyed by many!

This is an excellent baseline recipe. For those who have had trouble getting the marshmallows not to melt try this. Wait unti after baking to add the marshmallows then use your broiler to brown and melt them. The yams heat the bottom and the broiler the top. Works great, but keep an eye on it so they don't burn.

Love, Love, Love! this recipe is sooo easy.  I tried it 3 years ago and have been making it for Thanksgiving ever since. I sprinkle yams with cinnamon and add chopped pecans before layering with marshmallows.

Always use fresh yams or sweet potatoes (boiled until soft), I also add orange juice (not too much) and cinnamon with all other ingredients.  The orange juice gives it a really nice flavor.

This was a hit!  I do not eat Yams, but made the dish for my family and everyone LOVED it!  I allowed the yams to cook in the over until they got hot, then I added the mini marshmallows (the entire bag).  I did this so I could make sure that the top didn't burn.  This will definitely be on the Thanksgiving menu this year!

Very good, but it was way too long for the marshmallows to be uncovered.  They were almost burned in only 15 minutes.  I put on some oil-sprayed foil at that point, and it turned out alright.  I'm just glad we were watching.  Also, the directions don't mention draining the potatoes, but that's what you need to do.  I also mashed them a little but not too much.  One of my friends said "this is the best thing to ever happen to sweet potatoes" and proceeded to eat 3 helpings!

I drained the yams and mashed the ingredients in. Adding a light layer of pecans under the marshmellows made this an even better dish.

Very yummy recipe, but I agree marshmallows should be added in at very end, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM. Mine melted down & I had no more to use, so it tasted wonderful but didn't have a neat topping. I can't wait to make this again :-)

Bake fresh yams in foil or Roast in oil to retain sweetness and flavor! boiling makes them bland.

Been making these since I was a kid and they are great, especially with the young set. Just a couple of tips: yes drain them, lighlty mashing makes them easier to serve more people ( We like them mashed more with butter for a creamier texture), we add cinammon and a dash of nutmeg-cook them to heat through on the stove top, then add them to the pan and top with marshmallows, just baking till they are nicely browned. You can also add coarsely chopped nuts like pecans before baking. Hope that helps some folks! :)

These were great yams. I have been making sweet potato casseroles for years, but not the candied variety.  It was a nice change of pace.  I did however make some changes.  For those who said or were concerned about them being "watery or soupy", here is a solution.  The canned yams need to be dried.  You can "dry" them by draining them and putting them on a lightly greased sheet pan.  Put them in a 200 degree oven for 1 hour. Now put them in a casserole dish.  I sprinkled mine with a light dusting of cinnamon.  I then put pea size dots of butter over them.  I didn't use the required amount of butter stated...it was too much for my taste.  I sprinkled about 1 tbs. of white sugar over the cinnamon and butter.  I then spread the brown sugar over it and baked according to directions.  It came out great and not too sweet.  It had a sticky (not watery) glaze on it like I remembered them to have.  I didn't use the marshmallows. I will save those for my sweet potato casserole.  I will definately make these again.

this is a great recipe but i just changed it a bit. i used a 1/3 cup of butter mashed the yams first and put in the oven 40 min. at 350 works alot better. i feel that 400 at 25 min. cooks way too fast.

Great reciepe!  I used 2 large cans of Bruce's yams, drained all of the juice, cut up the yams into smaller bits and then followed the rest of the reciepe the same.  It was very sweet and the toasted marshmallows on top were AWESOME!!  My husband NEVER eats stuff like this and he gobbled it up!  This will definaltey be a Thanksgiving/Christmas food item at our house :o)

With all the fancy sweet potato recipes out there this is the one I make every year because it's the way my mom made them and it reminds me of her.However I don't bake these.I melt the butter in a large skillet,add brown sugar and cook till bubbles form. Add DRAINED sweet potatoes turn to coat and cook uncovered medium heat turning every few minutes till heated through.

This recipe is simple and delicious. To keep marshmallows from melting, cook with foil on and take off for the last 8 minutes to brown, it will turn out beautiful. You can also cook without marshmallows and add at the last few minutes. Wonderful!

I made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2001, and my family enjoyed it both times. I do like my yams SWEET, and I know some people don't, so if you don't, this recipe may be a little too sweet for your tastes. In the future, I might try adding some crushed pineapple.

I was late for Chirstmas dinner, so I brought all the stuff to make this dish. Of course everything was ready when I got there. I just threw it together and baked while we set the table. It was done even before the turkey was carved. I added some cinamon and slivered almonds to the very top before cooking, tasted great! I left it in the oven until the top got golden brown and the marshmallows just started to melt.

I used fresh yams and cubes them.  I also added cinnamon-an idea from previous reviews. I added another half cup marshmallows and the dish came out perfect!  Everyone at my Christmas Eve dinner loved them!

I have a major sweet tooth so I added more brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon as suggested by other reviews.  I loved it!  My boyfriend's dad also commented on how much he enjoyed it out of all the other things we had for Christmas dinner, too.  I plan to make any excuse I can to cook this dish again!

This is a great recipe.  I mixed the butter, brown sugar and some heavy cream together and poured over the potatoes.  The cream makes it even better.  I also chopped walnuts and sprinkled on top of the marshmallows. My family raved about them.

Yum, thanks for the recipe. I always add a drizzle of honey and some spices if I feel like it (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves). Pulled it out at 20 min.

This dish turned out perfectly!  I added pineapple rings to the bottom of the dish first and covered the dish with tin foil while baking and removed the foil the last 8 minutes of cook time and the marshmallows browned nicely without completely melting.  I couldn't have been happier!  Thanks!

I followed the directions, but the marshmallows melt at the end of 25 minutes.  It would be better to state in the recipe to put the marshmallows on the last 10 minutes, so they do not burn or melt away.

So easy. So good. I followed other viewers advice about adding vanilla extract, cinnamon and melting the butter for better distribution. Loved it and before this I never really liked candied yams.

This recipe was really great.  I took the advice of other reviews, and drained the sweet potatos, mashed them up a bit and added cinnamon.  My boyfriend and I finished the entire dish the night I made it.

This was super easy and quick to prepare. I was disappointed because a lot of the marshmallows melted so it didn't look very pretty. But it tasted wonderful. My family loved it. I think next time I'll use less brown sugar and more marshmallows or maybe big marshmallows.

Simply Fantastic.  I made these ahead of time and then just warmed them up in the oven next to the ham in the last half hour or so.  I peeled, cubed then micro waved the yams, arranged them in a baking dish, brushed generously with butter, and then sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon and a bit of maple sugar that sitting around.  Lightly topped with marshmallows, and then covered the entire thing popped it into the oven in the last 20 mins or so at 375.  Uncovered it for 10 mins to toast the marshmallows a bit.  All I can say is amazing.  They were a bit sweet to be sure, but texture and smell were heavenly.  My 3 year old got the most amazing look on her face when she tried them.  I'll be doing these at christmas for sure now :)

Good Recipe if you're on the go. I prefer using Fresh Sweet Potatoes Over the canned ones, but it is quicker using the canned ones but so much tastier fresh. What ever you prefer. Won't hurt my feelings!

This is a must have for our family at Thanksgiving.  I'd probably be disowned if I didn't make it.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I make a few changes.  I make this recipe x5 because we have a big family and everyone loves it.  I cut down on the butter a little and use the liquid from the yams to make up the difference(probably about 2/3 butter to 1/3 yam liquid). I melt the butter and add the brown sugar with a little nutmeg and vanilla. I added pineapple one year and everyone loved it so now I always do.  One year I put the pineapple slices on the bottom of the pan and it was really good.  The next year I tried adding pineapple chunks to the yams and everyone raved about it. I use mini marshmallows and add them after fully cooking the yams. They come out nicely browned and gooey.

I used a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes(drained), kept the sugar and butter the same, sprinkled with cinnamon between the butter and sugar, and cut large marshmallows in half for this recipe. Covered for the first 15 min. only. The marshmallows didn't melt, but came out perfectly poofy and brown. I will definitely be making this again next Thanksgiving!!

Not only was this recipe very simple, but very tasty!!!  It was my first time cooking a holiday meal for my family and I must admit that sweet potatoes and yams are just not something my family makes but my husband insisted it had to be on the table.  Much to my surprise, there was nothing left over from this dish, nor did it end up in the trash!!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I will be serving this for all my holiday cooking!!  For me, there is no reason to alter it in my opinion.  It's delicious just the way it is.  :)

The only thing I did not like about this recipe is that the marshmallows were completely melted after 25 minutes. I will put them on later next time. Otherwise, it is delicious!

Oh My Goodness!  These are the best candied yams I've ever had!  Ok, so I didn't even think I liked candied yams, then I made these.  I drained ALL the liquid out and added some cinnamon.  Absolutely Fantastic!

This were great and easy. I used fresh yams and just cooked them in the microwave until they were soft, then cut them into chunks just like the ones in the can. I also sprinkled some cinnimon in along with the brown sugar. They turned out perfect!

This has become a holiday favorite for the past 2 years.  I like to add chopped pecans on top of the marshmallow for a little extra flavor.

This was very good, I used fresh Yams (4) peeled, cubed and boiled for about 15 mins (until tender), put them into a casserole, added the butter and brown sugar (I put a smidge more then called for in the recipe..we like them sweet) and then I added a cup of marshmallows and baked.
About 5 mins before serving I added more marshmallows to the top and let them cook/brown.
At the very end I turned on the Broiler to high and let them really brown up, everyone loved them!

This was great, IF your looking for the really sweet sweet potatoes with marshmallows!  Of course I was, so I felt like this was a great basic candied yams recipe.  The only changes that I made were that I mashed the sweet potatoes (I warmed them up in thier own juice from the cans, then mashed them adding some cinnamon and nutmeg).  And since I doubled the recipe I just winged it as far as the butter, brown sugar and marshmallow went.  But I did take the lid off the casserole dish the last ten minutes or so to toast up the marshmallows.

The recipe didnt say to drain the sweet potatoes, but I did drain part of the liquid off.  My marshmallows didnt toast up and look pretty, but the dish still tasted great!!  I liked the fact that the potatoes were in pieces rather than mashed (nice to have different textures at the table) and what syrup I left on them got nice and thick, like a candy syrup.  I will be keeping this recipe for sure!!

One possible solution to the marshmallows melting away is the way my Mom used to make this recipe. Drain the cans and reserve the liquid. Place in saucepan with the brown sugar and butter and reduce by half which gives you a sticky type delicious syrup. Then pour over sweet potatoes and bake. Adding the mini marshmallows in the last ten minutes or so uncovered.

Great basic recipe. Used a larger can of sweet potatoes (yams); I coarsely mashed the yams and added 1/2 of the brown sugar to them, 1 tbsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I put the remainder of the brown sugar on top with the margarine and the marshmallows. I don't like pecans but they would be a good addition to the top also. Baked 15 minutes covered with foil and 15 minutes uncovered to let the marshmallows brown. Make sure you drain the yams or you will have a mess.

My In-Laws had seconds! Here were my modifications:  I bought fresh yams and baked them for an hour. Then I sliced them and layered them with butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar in the middle and more brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and marshmallows on the top.  (Over all I only used about 1/2 the recommended brown sugar and they were plenty sweet).  I think next time I will put some orange juice in as well, the tang would have been a nice complement to the sweetness.

I made this for my office Thanksgiving party and for a dish for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic.    The thing I wanted to do was put marshmallows in the center like an oreo cookie but I forgot the butter after I finished the masterpiece.  I had to throw back in a bowl and mixed everything together as well as cinnamon throughout the mixture (not just a tsp).    After putting back in the pan I topped with another bag (I mixed 1 bag already in mixture) of marshmallows on the top and baked.  I turned the temp down to 350 and baked for an hour (I was serving 30) then I removed the foil off and baked for another 10-15 min,  My dish was the talk of the office and it was requested by a coworker that was joining me at another coworkers house for Thanksgiving dinner!!

This was a really yummy recipe. It was a hit with the whole family.The only complaint i had was the recipe did not say to drain the yams. I did drain them and i'm really glad i did. It was great when we ate it last night but it was better after it sit overnight. I warmed them back up in the microwave and even added more marshmallows and it was AMAZING. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Apparently this was great! In fact, I should have made much more. I didn't even get to try it becuase it was all gone in minutes. I think it would be just as good without quite as much butter and brown sugar though. Enjoy!

I have used this method for many years however I discovered a new way. I mix butter, brown sugar, cornstarch, and a little milk or heavy cream. Pour over the yams and bake. It takes the real sweetness out and it's thick. I didn't measure anything, just kinda threw it together. Turned out great.....

I mixed in the brown sugar with the yams as recommended, then dabbed the top with butter all over. I then sprinkled cinnamon over the butter and covered in a layer of marsh mellows. I would definitely use more marsh mellows next time.

This recipe got me compliments from all 8 people at the dinner table tonight!  We were having a post-thanksgiving weekend dinner (with turkey, green bean casserole, etc.)and this was the first time I'd ever made candied yams.  They turned out fantastic!  I also added cinnamon after the butter/sugar combo was in place.  And, I added the marshmallows at the last 5 minutes in the oven.  This was fantastic!  Everyone got seconds. :-)

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were excellent and everyone else thought so too. I was asked to make them again for Christmas. The only change that I made was I mashed the yams and then topped them with the butter, brown sugar and the marshmellows. I like that way because you don't have to worry about the marshmellows running into the juices.

These were fantastic!  I am 49 years old, and have just found out I like yams.  I would've taken a picture, but they disappeared too quickly!  I did put extra marshmallows on at the end and put them under the broiler for a brief browning....be sure and keep your eyes on those marshmallows ~ Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I made this for my 13 year old who love her grandmother's candied yams. My husband and I are not yam fans, but half the dish was gone in one sitting. My daughter said it was better than her grandmother's (YEA!) so this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow....so incredibly easy and so delicious.  The sauce was just right, a little sweet is how I like them.  I waited until the last 10 minutes to add the marshmallows, and covered with foil and they actually browned some and started to melt just a little.  The only thing I didn't like was, well, the yams.  That's the first and last time I buy them canned.  This recipe is a keeper, but it's worth putting in a little extra effort with fresh yams.

This was so easy and good I'm sure I'll use it for the rest of my life!  I did add some vanilla and nutmeg before I baked it and I didn't use marshmellows.  Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved these candied yams!

I loved it! My hubby also loved it--and he is definitely not a sweets-kinda person. I appreciated the tips from previous reviewers, too. I used 4 large yams. I cut them up, placed them in a large bowl and microwaved them for about 20-25 minutes, stopping every once in a while to check their mushiness. Once I was able to easily mash them, I then added cinnamon and a touch of pumpkin spice seasoning (the Trader Joe's spice jar I have literally says "Pumpkin Pie Spice", and it contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cardamom). I also added a dash of vanilla (real vanilla--not artificial). I stirred the cinnamon, pumpkin spice, vanilla and brown sugar into the yams. Then I placed the yams in my baking dish and topped it with chopped up butter. I thoroughly covered my baking dish with aluminum foil to ensure the marshmallows wouldn't get cemented into the pan, as advised by a previous reviewer. I also used Pam oil spray to spray the aluminum foil that covered the candied yams so that the marshmallows eouldn't stick to it. I baked it covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered it, added more marshmallows, and baked it again for 5 minutes to let the marshmallows toast to a golden brown. Toasting this way really was like toasting them over a campfire, as a previous reviewer mentioned. This was my first time making candied yams, and I didn't expect it to turn out right, but it turned out amazingly delicious ! It was a pan full of golden, gooey yumminess!

This was the most simple yet delicious recipe ever. After reading previous reviews, I too drained the juice from the canned yams and also added cinnamon. All I can say is delicious! These yams complimented my easter dinner with ease. Everyone love them!

So simple and yet soo good! I added cinnamon and the flavor was just perfect to my standards. I know the recipe didn't mention draining the yams and it is a little confusing to those who have never made it before but I've made candied yams before and know that when using canned yams this is a must. Hopefully this get's cleared up for other users viewing the recipe.

I used a 40oz can of yams and changed amounts of other ingredients based on what looked right. I also added cinnamon because a previous review recommended it, and it was fantastic. Make sure you drain the yams or use too much butter, and it will be perfect. Delicious!

Drained potatoes and mashed them, then mixed together with brown sugar, sprinkled cinnamon ALL over the sliced butter. Uncover for last 10 minutes to brown marshmallows (and add EXTRA marshmallows than recipe calls for). Delicious!!! This is my go-to sweet potato recipe :))

My husband really enjoys this dish.  I drained the yams and added a bit of salt because I use unsalted butter.  It really added good flavor.  I also uncovered the dish for a bit so that the mellows could brown.

I am glad that I had a 40 oz can of yams...the small can would have only served 2. I drained most of the juice off but was afraid that it would be too dry so I drizzled about 1/3 cup, next time I will drain it all off and use a smaller dish, I used a 8 in square and I thought it was too thin. I also mashed them slightly, but won't do that again, it was too soggy and the marshmallows just melted into the juice. I added more marshmallows after it baked. Maybe next time I'll add pecans for some extra texture.

This was great with a few suggestion from other reviewers.  Added Cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little vanilla extract, minus the marshmallows. I also dried the sweet potatoes at 200 degrees for 30min prior to mixing the ingredients. I made enough to feed 40 3rd grade kids! They loved it!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit! The only thing I did differently was I added a dash of Cinnamon. My husband noted that they tasted different from Last years yams and that he liked that these were "spicy".

sorry!!  I made it exactly as recipe called and the outcome was an ugly presentation and nobody touched it.
I don't know what went wrong, maybe it was me.

BY FAR the BEST sweet potatoes I've ever had! Very easy and a huge family hit! I actually cooked them a tad too long to where the marshmallows melted completely and wow, what a tasty mistake... it made my dish that time even better!   I don't normally leave reviews but, man, this one was well worth it!

I'm assuming you're supposed to drain the yams.  I've never had yams before so I had no idea.  Thanks to the recipe not stating that fact, I have no yams to bring for dinner.  Instead, I have yam soup.  I'm going to try to reduce them some way in a pan, or maybe add some cream.

Sorry, I was disappointed with this.  I didn't get rave reviews, and my family wanted our other candied yam recipe.  No one had seconds, and here it is almost 2 weeks past Thanksgiving and the left overs are still sitting in the fridge.  Sigh, I guess I'll go get rid of them.

I normally don't like yams but my wife asked me to find a recipe and I used this one and it came out really great. I substituted the can yams for 3 large fresh yams, which were boiled and mashed.

Very good!  You should mash them up some with a little of the juice so that they absorb the butter better.

This is a great recipe! I couldn't find the recipe we used to make at home, and this one was very similar. I used boiled sweet potatoes instead of canned. I also added pineapple rings to the bottom of the baking dish. I plan to use this again next Thanksgiving!

Loved it!  Definitely add a generous sprinkling of cinnamon before you dot with butter!  Also, mash them coarsely to leave some texture & like another reviewer said, so the  marshmallows don't melt & dissappear.  You may need to add extra marshmallows like i did about 5 minutes before removing from oven.   Next time, I may use 1/4 C white sugar & 1/4 C brown sugar.  All in all, a GREAT recipe for canned sweet potatoes!  Very simple & short prep & cooking time!   We will absolutely add this to our list of favorites to enjoy again & again.  Thank you!

My family loved this recipe. I did use fresh yams. Boiled till tender the day before, skinned, cut up and placed in casserole. After reading others using cinnamon etc, I used some nutmeg and cinnamon - vey lite sprinkle of each along with 1/2 brown sugar called for and added some trivia (Hubby is watching blood sugar levels too) so left off marshmellows on 1/2 of casserole - got eaten all the same!. We will be using this recipe many times!

I started making this when my kids were little.  Now I'm a Grandfather and I still get requests for it every year.  I always have to double the recipe.  The variation that I use is to drain the cans, reserving 1/2 cup of the juice.  Then I add 1/2 cup spiced rum and 2 teaspoons of ground allspice (for a double recipe).  Also I do not add the marshmallows until the last few minutes of cooking - just long enough for them to melt slightly and take on some color.  To make sure all the pieces are completely coated, I'll stir them a couple of times while baking, the last time being just before I add the marshmallows.

I make it with fresh yams, peeled, chopped, topped with butter and brown sugar then microwaved until yams are tender. I top with full sized Jet Puffed marshmallows--as many as I can stuff on top of the yams and just before serving I place under the broiler and toast the marshmallows so they get very brown and toasty on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside...tastes exactly like campfire marshmallows.  Our kids all love these yams...it's the only dish at the holidays with no leftovers. One year I even went a bit too far and the marshmallows caught fire...blew it out and served them and everyone went nuts and wanted me to start doing them that way from now on. I don't though, because I'm afraid it's carcinogenic. Great way to cook yams!

I love this recipe and never thought of cinnamon.  Nice addition.  One thing I do just because I like to use some of the juice (heated) is thicken it with a mix of cold water/cornstarch and pour over the sweet potatoes.  Then I add the butter, brown sugar and a few marshmellows.  When it's about done, then I add more MINIATURE (lol) m'mellows to brown and hold their shape better.  Hope this is helpful.

These were great! I drained my sweet potatoes and made two batches. One dish I added cinnamon, and the other dish I did not. We liked the one with cinnamon more! Thanks to the reviewers who suggested it! Still though, the one made exactly as the recipe stated received great reviews from my Christmas dinner guests.

I love this recipe.  I use three large yams, peel them, cut them into 2X2 inch pieces, boil until tender.  Then I add the butter, brown sugar and a couple splashes of Sherry into the mix.  Then I follow the rest of the recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

EASY and SO GOOD!  I was short for time so I melted butter in a electric fry skillet, threw the DRAINED yams in, sprinkled the brown sugar and mixed all together.  I let them simmer for 5 minutes or so and then transferred to a baking dish.  I sprinkled with the marshmallows and put it in the 400 degree oven for another 5 minutes or until the marshmallows were golden brown.  Everyone loved it!

Easy recipe. Only thing I recommend would be to puree the yams (I pureed them in a food processor) before placing them in a baking dish.  I made them last Thanksgiving without pureeing them and it tasted good, but the consistency/presentation wasn't appealing.  So this year I pureed them and there weren't any leftover!

I normally can't stand yams or sweet potatoes. I made the yams for my husband for Thanksgiving and I even liked them! I did mash the sweet potatoes and added a dash of cinnamon as others suggested but this was still a great recipe! Thank you!

Followed recipe exactly, including draining yams.  Pan was too full of liquid though, not sure how to solve that problem.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 4 yams sliced and cubed.  Steamed them. Then added Cinnamon before putting it in the oven.  I hate yams but holy wow these ones were gone in a blink!  Thanks so much

I didn't want to use canned yams, as I had fresh ones in my kitchen. Because I was also making sweet potato pie, I boiled them all together with 2 cinnamon sticks and 2 tsp of vanilla, (I was using a big pot). I peeled them after and they were to soft to cube so I mashed them for some texture and mixed in some of the brown sugar and butter, but I topped it with the remaining. All in all it was a hit (:  remember to spray the foil before covering, as per another reviewer. ENJOY!

I used fresh yams and probably didn't microwave them long enough prior to putting them in the main dish. I had to bake the dish for an extra 20 mins or so because the yams were still hard. By cooking it this extra time, the marshmallows almost disappeared. But luckily... they were the most delicious yams EVER! They were a HUGE hit at our party.

Very good.  I followed the ingredients and cooking time but mashed the potatoes a bit with a fork, sprinkled with a little bit of cinnamon, covered with the cut up butter and brown sugar then mixed it all together.  Topped with marshmellows and baked.  Everyone liked it but the grandkids REALLY gobbled it up!

This was so tasty that my husband, not a big fan of yams, loved it!  I followed a suggestion and sprinkled a little cinnamon on the drained and mashed yams and then I mixed the brown sugar and butter bits in with the yams.  I didn't have an oven available to cook this at 400, so I put it in the 350 oven for about 35 minutes (the marshmallows just turned golden).  Fantastic and easy!  Thank you!!!

This was an excellent recipe,  I myself am not fond of sweet potatoes but............ I did tweek a bit although I'm sure it would have been just fine as is. I baked the sweet potatoes til they were just getting soft. Then peeled and sliced them about 1 in. thick. Put in casserole dish. I boiled the butter and brown sugar and added 2 Tbls. of real maple syrup.  Poured over sweet potatoes and topped with marshmallows and baked.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Pretty standard but tasty.  There was a lot of butter at the bottom of the dish but the flavors were nice.  I did add a dash of cinnamon and it added a nice twist.  Easy and delicious.

Delicious! This was an awesome, fast side dish. I did follow a previous poster's tips-I drained the sweet potatoes, coarsely mashed them, sprinkled them with cinnamon and baked them without the foil at the end to brown the marshmallows. They were delicious!

I love this recipe and it is a hit! I did make a few adjustments.  First, I had to cook it a little longer to make sure all the pieces were soft (I used fresh yams) and then I mashed them up, covered with Marshmallows and baked for another 10 minutes. Yum!

Unfortunately these were not received as well as I thought. I had complaints that they were too sticky and overly sweet, and the next day after they were refrigerated, I was told that they were slimy. Don't think I will be making these again.

Simple and delicious! Although a lot of the butter melted and pooled in the bottom of the baking pan, the sweet potatoes tasted buttery, delicious, and utterly decadent.

A couple of tips: You may need to double the recipe to fill a baking pan (I used a 9x9 cake pan and had to run to the store for more yams), and I highly recommend the addition of cinnamon as others have mentioned.

WONDERFULLY DELICOUS! The only thing I did different was instead of using canned yams, I used fresh yams wrapped in foil and baked while I cooked my turkey.  When they were ready I cut them into thick slices and followed the rest of the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this yesterday for my husband's Army company and and I guilt tripped some of the guys into eating it...and well, they LOVED IT! Two of them told me they had never had anything like it before and it was amazing.

I did add the cinamon and extra marshmellows and cooked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes then at 200 degrees for an hour. It made the marshmellows PERFECT.

Before I followed this recipe, I read many reviews to get as much advice as I can. I did everything the recipe told me to, except I drained all the liquid out of the can. I mixed the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar, butter (less butter than told), and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of Vanilla...I wanted to use cinnamon but I didn't have any. I then added the marshmallows.

Last 15 minutes, I uncovered the marhsmallows so it could brown a bit...someone gave advice to spray grease on the foil to prevent the mallows from sticking, great idea.

It was a bit plain afterwards, I added some sliced pineapples from a can to it, baked it a bit longer and it was tasty! mmm! mm!

I made and brought this dish to a work function and everyone was all over it!  Everyone wanted the recipe!

I would recommend adding cinnimon to the recipe and cutting way down on the butter.  I also used large marshmallows and fresh boiled yams.

I will be incorporating this dish for family thanksgivings and Christmas for sure!

This recipe is great, I did make a few alterations.  I did mash the yams coursly, and I also added canned peaches (in syrup), also some vanilla, and cinnamon.  People loved it and its an old tradition in my family!!!!

We liked this a lot.  The only change I made was that I whipped the potatoes in my mixer first.  If they were whole my kids wouldn't have eaten them.

This is so good, it's the only dish that doesn't make it to Thanksgiving leftovers! I double the recipe and cook it in a 9x13 dish.

This recipe is great I got great reviews on it. I did the dash of vanilla extract and the dash of cinnamon but also added some clove to it and it was delicious.

This has always been a favorite of mine but this is the first time I had ever tried to make it myself.  I Used fresh yams, peeled them, forked them, wrapped loosely in plastic wrap and zapped in microwave.  Then I sliced and followed recipe, cooking only for 10 minutes allowing the sauce to form, then added marshmallows and cooked for another 5.

Absolutely the BEST!  I did use yams and placed them in the microwave for 15 minutes.  Then followed the recipe adding cinnamon and pecans.  Everybody had seconds.  I'm always nervous making a new recipe for a large number of guests but this one turned out great and will be on my table for all family gatherings and holidays.  THANKS

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was truly amazing. I had some pecan halves, so I threw those in under the marshmallows, and it gave it a great crunch.

Coming from somebody who has never liked yams, this was absolutely delicious.  I boiled fresh yams until half cooked, peeled, and sliced them.  As an additional I dusted brown sugar layer with cinnamon.  Top notch recipe, even for those who don't know they like yams...yet.

this recipe was wonderful! Last year was my first year ever cooking anything by myself for thanksgiving and I ended up making them twice! They were gone by the end of the night. I dont usually like yams at all, however, these were very delicious!  Im going to make them again this year for Thanksgiving!!  It did take a little longer than I expected to cook.

Don’t forget to drain!

This recipe never mentions anything about draining the liquid from the canned yams. This will make them extremely runny and in most cases ruin the entire dish. It’s an easy recipe but a huge fail on the author’s part for neglecting to mention this. Big thumbs down.

I made this, with a few fixes 1. Drain yams first and 2. Add marshmallows to pan after yams are done cooking. It prevents the melting of your marshmallows

This is a good recipe and candied yams have always been one of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes. One change that I will recommend is to use Kosher marshmallows.  Even if you are not Jewish, they provide a crispy texture that you can't achieve with regular marshmallows and it makes a significant difference.

Perfect. Would recommend using larger pan to get a better marshmallow to yam ratio. Be very careful not to overcook the marshmallow because they will get very hard.

Suggestions!
Great and easy recipe, but next time I think 20 min will be better than 25 for me, a little too cooked.
1. Wipe the entire inside of your pan with Crisco, a good coat. Super easy clean up after!
2. Sprinkle cinnamon over the butter, before brown sugar. Delish!

I agree with the other post. They didn't say "drain yams" but luckily I read the comments first. The only thing I did differently was add cinnamon (just a sprinkle) as well as vanilla abstract (1 tablespoon). Also I put the yams and all the other ingredients in the oven for 25 min. Then I took it out and then added marshmallows and put it in oven for another 10min. It was delicious!! I will definitely make this again!

I make these every year with one addition that gets me rave reviews: chopped pecans! Just sprinkle them over the yams and marshmallows before baking. I usually am pretty generous with them; the crunch and taste add a nice relief to the sweetness and consistency of the candied yams!

This was very easy to make and very good. I did drain and mash the yams before placing in baking dish. I also added cinnamon before the brown sugar. I covered the dish with foil for 20 mins then the last 5 I removed the foil and my marshmallow were golden and crispy. Not melted in at all which was awesome.

I altered recipe some. Used canned sweet potatoes (29oz) and drained all but a portion of it (1/2 cup). Added cinnamon to the mixture and pineapple tidbits.  I placed in a qt. size pot and brought to a simmer for awhile. Then transferred to an oven safe dish, sprinkled pecans and marshmallows and placed in a 350 degree oven until marshmallows are browned. It's a little more work but the sweet potatoes come out nice and warm and the marshmallows don't burn.

The marshmallows burned even before the yams were warm. I would suggest starting either with it covered with foil then removing the foil the last 10 minutes,  or waiting until the last 10 minutes to put the marshmallows on.

This came out delicious!  Make sure you drain the yams.  This is the trick to not melting all of the marshmallows.  I also added cinnamon as others suggested and started baking the yams with half of the marshmallows.  when there were 5 minutes left I added the rest of the marshmallows and when I say these yams were good…I mean they tasted heavenly.  The marshmallows were nice and toasted.  This dish did not last long in my household.  I will definitely make again.

This is the best recipe! I added my own twist to it. I drained the yams and mashed them a bit. I also mixed the brown sugar into it and then I sprinkled cinnamon all over. I also crumbled graham crackers and sprinkled it all over to give it a bit of crunchiness. I added the cut up pieces of butter and marshmallows. Voila! Thank goodness I have enough ingredients to make more.

I have used this recipe for years. My husband is the only one that eats them so he loves them made this way. Only exception is I add cinnamon and chopped pecans as well to give texture.

I made this recipe last night to practice for Thanksgiving. I boiled the sweet potatoes and mash them and mix them with cinnamon salt dark brown sugar and unsalted butter. The store didn't have the mini marshmallows so I used the regular size (which I would not use again, the mini would work best) the dish was a hit and will be definitely making it for thanksgiving!

We had a mini Thanksgiving dinner with friends, we were craving turkey and stuffing, and you have to have candied yams with that so I tried this and it turned out the best I've had. I used canned yams and cut into smaller pieces. Melted the butter and brown sugar then poured over the yams. Also cooked longer than recipe said and sauce got thick and gooey. Very good.

Drain the yam juice. Using the cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg,a pinch of salt, the brown sugar, butter and a cup of orange juice, Bring to a boil then add the yams to this mixture and continue to cook just below a boil for just about 4 minutes to just thicken this a little and soften  the yams.  Then pour this all into a casserole and let cook for about 25 - 30 minutes, until bubbly.  THEN put the mini marshmallows all over the top and put back into oven for a few minutes to soften the marshmallows.  If you want to turn on the broiler to  toast the tops of the marshmallows,BUT DO NOT WALK AWAY... just to put a slight toasty look to the marshmallows, which should still retain their shape.  The orange gives an extra kick to the flavor.

I've made this for years, always used drained canned yams mashed up, then add the sugar and cinnamon - give it a stir and add pineapple chunks to it. I microwave the potatoes so they are hot, then put them in the oven with the marshmellows on top because otherwise, the marshmellows get overcooked and brown too much.

My fiance Tyler and I made this recipe, using canned cut Princella Sweet Potatoes. We used various reviewer's suggestions of draining the sweet potatoes first, and adding cinnamon after the butter. The result turned out very flavorful and sweet. The cinnamon is a perfect addition! However, next time I think I will use less brown sugar and omit the marshmallows, as the dish is candy sweet already in itself. Overall, a tasty recipe!

REALLY good! I'm always the one to make sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving, but I've always whipped them up with half and half and salt and pepper (which I really like) but for Christmas, I was asked to make candied yams and DANG this was good **AND** simple!! This is a keeper - MIGHT add pecans or walnuts next time! OH - and I did use fresh potatoes and just followed another suggestion of microwaving beforehand. I did this the night before and stuck them in the fridge so they weren't hot to handle when peeling.

This was delish! I took the advice of other reviewers and backed off the sugar, doubled the recipe, added nutmeg & cinnamon and I too added a little cinnamon sugar. Next time I'll cut back some on the butter, as I think that could be reduced some. I also drained the canned yams, rinsed them with water, sliced them some then baked with the top on for about 25 minutes. I added the marshmellows last with the top removed and broiled them for a couple of minutes. Turned out perfect! A huge hit in my house and will be my staple dish for Thanksgiving.

This was EXACTLY what taste I was looking for.  I did sprinkle a little cinnamon after reading others' suggestions.  Perfect!  I kept it covered until the last 5-10 minutes or so (not sure exactly) and the marshmallows were perfectly lightly browned on top and melty on the bottom.  So easy too -I made this ahead the night before and it literally took like 5 minutes.

THE ONLY THING THAT I CHANGED ON THE RECIPE/DIRECTIONS WAS THAT I DRAINED, MASHED, AND MIXED THE SWEET POTATOES WITH THE BROWN SUGAR FIRST AS RECOMMENDED BY ANOTHER REVIEWER AND........IT WAS TOO SWEET, TOO MUCH BUTTER AND THE MARSHMALLOWS MELTED RIGHT IN TO THE SWEET POTATOES.   NEXT TIME I AM DEF. GOING TO USE CINNAMON PLUS HALF THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND LESS SUGAR!  AS FOR THE MARSHMALLOWS HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO BROWN AND NOT MELT??

This recipe gets three starts because it is a great starter recipe, but it is a bit plain.  Also, if you have a lot of people to feed, one 29 ounce can of sweet potatoes is not even close to enough.  To save the dish, I had to run out and buy sweet potatoes and boil them separately to bulk up the proportions.  To spice everything up a bit more, I also added a couple granny smith apples to mitigate the intense sweetness, some walnuts (or pecans), and a little orange zest to brighten it up.  Overall, a solid recipe except for the proportions, and tasty.

I always use fresh potatos boiled, then mashed with a fork. "I cant believe its not Butter" has a great FAT-FREE butter. I also add Cinnamon and Nutmeg. I alwayz mix a little marshmallows in with the potato mixture for extra "marshmallow surprises" =] This dish turned out awesome!!!!!

I drained the yams, yet it still came out runny. It tasted fine, but I didn't care for how it looked.

Will use again, the kids loved it, we all had seconds, probably because it's so sweet. I put in pecans and a dash of cinnamon. Don't let the marshmallows brown too much, you'll just get a crispy topping.

Tastes pretty good, very easy to prepare the night before and just pop into the oven for dinner, too sweet for a main course meal, try candied yams with apples instead of marshmallows.

It was the first time and a good recipe to follow... I had made a double batch for a christmas party for some submariners and they loved them. To add a festive touch I used the colored small marshmallows along the edges and bigger marshmallows in the middle so it looked like christmas lights in the snow and the small ones being flavored didnt do anything to the taste at all... still a classic recipe.

DELICIOUS. Except I would definitely recommend using the large marshmallows and not adding them until the very end in the oven. My small ones were lost in the process :) And drain the yams !!

Delicious!  I used fresh yams (and cubed and steamed them til soft), slightly reduced the sugar and sprinkled plenty of cinnamon.  It came out beautifully.

I am only giving 4 stars because I had to make the following adjustments to the recipe: 1.) If using canned yams, chop them into smaller bite sized pieces and drain well. 2.) Add some spice - cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger. 3.) Either cover the pan for the majority of the recipe, OR cook for a bit before adding the marshmallows. Additionally I mixed the yams, sugar, spice, etc with a tablespoon of cornstarch and also some pineapple tidbits. I used some fresh grated ginger (yum) and cooked on the stove top until heated through. Then I placed it in the crust and topped with the marshmallows and cooked until puffed and golden.

This is very good!  I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also add more marshmallows 5 min before I remove it from the oven because the other ones melt away to nothing.

Best thing to do is make this a night before.  I boil my yams (not sweet potato) cut into bite size pieces, put brown sugar on top or layer if you have lots of yams (don't put butter or marshmallow yet).  Cover and put it in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour out tip the pan and pour out the extra sauce. Add just alittle more brown sugar, not much, dot with butter and top with the mini marshmallows.  Bake uncover for about 1 hour.  It will come out like you soaked the yams in syrup and it won't be so runny.  Often times people think I used canned yams. Lori's recipe is the way I use to make it 15 years ago.  Quick, easy, and tasty but lots of sauce

I had to review this again and say I didn't set the timer and forgot how long they had been in the oven (45 minutes total) upon taking them out I didn't have the usual runniness that was there they turned out much better with the longer cooking time.

Almost all of the 45 people at Thanksgiving dinner came up to me and told me that the yams were the best thing they had ever eaten!  One person told me that she doesn't even like yams and she still thought it was one of the best things ever!

I love candied yams but this recipe just wasn't sweet enough for my family.  Perhaps real yams instead of canned and a little more brown sugar next time.

I finally made perfect candied yams! I had to eliminate the marshmallows because my family didn't care to have them, but they came out perfect. I followed the recipe to a tee, and I had no trouble at all. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

This recipe is delicious and so easy.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was great.  I normally use fresh yams or sweet potatoes, but for a short cut this is perfect.  Will serve again.

Although this was very easy, it was not nearly as tasty as the candied yams made with REAL yams. I think I'll remake this using real parboiled yams instead of canned. The difference in taste is worth the extra effort.

Made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and this was very good using canned yams.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and didn't use marshmallows, just because I don't care for yams that are too sweet.  Tasted great!

Easy sweet potatoes.

I did cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and increased the butter to an extra pat.
I also added a bag of giant marshmallows 10 mins before the potatoes were ready so they retained the marshmallowy shapes but had a nice browned crust.
MIL loved it.

I do not usually like yams, but these were EXCELLENT. The best part was, I didn't even make them. I handed the recipe to my 10 and 11 year old nieces and they made the recipe for Thankgiving dinner. It was a huge hit, and they did it all on their own in about a half an hour. They put in two extra handfuls of marshmallows (being kids, of course) and forgot to cover it. But it made them extra gooey and delicious. Thanks so much!

I quadrupled this recipe for Thanksgiving, using canned sweet potatoes. Two of my kids helped me put it together (ages 4 and 6), and I got RAVE reviews from all my relatives. Thanks for this recipe! (We didn't mind at all that the marshmallows completely melted. It's usually a fight anyway as to who gets the top layer!)

I didnt like how the marshmallows werent browned and how they did melt into everything.  I used the big marshmallows yet still melted.  Maybe the yams should be mashed with the juice and mix with the butter and brown sugar bake it then add the marshmallows.  Not sure that I will make it again, it was easy but not what I was looking for.

I love cooking and I just love candied yams! There was only one problem when I made these. All the marshmallows on top melted COMPLETELY into the sweet potatoes. What did I do wrong? The only thing that I think I might have done wrong is I had to use the big marshmallows instead of the little ones but it was still the same amount of marshmallows. Oh well I will try again. This were super easy to make!! Thanks for the recipe

I added vanilla extract as someone else did. Also used fresh sweet potatoes. Boiled it for a bit then cooked it. May try boiling less time or try cooking it straight in the oven. Taste amazing though

I found this recipe at this site a few years ago . Since then, I’ve made it several times a year! I’ve made it with just cinnamon, cinnamon and nutmeg, with and without marshmallows and my favorite way, with pecans. My family loves this recipe.

I love how simple the recipe is! With that being said I did use normal size marshmallows because I felt the small ones don't work as well. One more thing is it shouldn't be assumed that we will all know to drain canned yams! So the recipe should state DRAIN YAMS FIRST!!!!!!!!!!

My husband grew up having yams with his family for Thanksgiving. I never liked yams until now. My kids actually ask for yams and say they only want me to make them.  Yes, this recipe is really that good.

Yummy!  Used large marshmallows and kept covered until last 10-15 minutes.  Drained and slightly mashed canned yams.   First time my marshmallows didn’t completely melt.  It did boil over a bit.  I recommend putting a cookie sheet under it.

I used the 29 ounce can of yams which made a small dish, thinking that no one would care much about yams since it is not a favorite of mine. I added some chopped  walnuts and  a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the brown sugar. The dish was devoured quickly and almost everyone requested seconds which I did not have.  Next time I will use the 40 ounce can and adjust other ingredients. I have already had a requests to make for Christmas. Thanks so much!

I love this recipe - so easy and delicious.  I use fresh yams, peeled, cubed, cooked in a pot of water until just about tender, drained them then followed the rest of this recipe. My daughter practically licked the bowl!! I've made them a couple of times but am just getting around to rating it.  It's SO GOOD!!

Make sure you drain the sweet potatoes first! I also cut some of them up into more bite-size pieces . I also used 2 cans of yams but kept everything else the same and it turned out great!! Everyone loved it :)

Im just not a fan of this dish.  As a kid growing up my mom used both canned and fresh yams.  She cut them, so i tried mashing just a bit.  I added brown sugar to the yams and mixed with spoon.  I cut a little more butter than recipe called for. Cut into small pieces and layered iver the yams.  I sprinkled cinnamon over the yams butter mixture.  I think this is where i went wrong. I coated that mixture with cinnamon.  I think if i used half that amount it would have been better.  I then cooked it in my toaster oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I used med marshmallows and had no problem with them melting.   my 12 guests enjoyed it and said there is no such thing as too much cinnamon.  They all enjoyed it.  That was what i was looking for.  I on the other hand am just not a big yams fan.

Super easy and everyone loved it.  If using canned yams, remember to drain yams and then rough mash with the back of a spoon. Use a small  casserole dish so the entire bottom is covered with yam. Sprinkle with brown sugar, sprinkle with cinnamon, dot with butter, use enough marshmallows to cover the top. Tent with foil. Baked covered 15-20 minutes then remove foil and continue baking until marshmallow is lightly browned.

I had the temp at 350 for the first 12 min before changing it to 400. Which probably was a good idea because it quickly browned after just another 5min. I made 2 at once the top rack came out he beat in appearance but both tasted amazing with a coffee. I cook it as a breakfast dish

Made this ahead of time with 4 large sweet potatoes peeled and cut into quarters before boiling. I boiled them too long so I made a mash instead. I used 1/4 of butter, but next time I'll probably use less. I also added cinnamon. brown sugar and marshmallows were spot on and this recipe was a hit with real sweet potatoes. I'll probably make a larger batch as well not many leftovers left after 3 people eating 4 large potatoes.

Very good. I used fresh sweet potatoes (cooking before) and followed the recipe. I did add just a little bit of cinnamon and ignored the marshmallow amount. I ended up using about a 1/2 bag. 

It was amazing. I cooked with foil until there were only 10 mins left - then I uncovered to really toast the marshmallows. 
My family loved!  
Next time I will decrease the amount of butter. It was a bit too watery at the bottom of the dish for my liking.

I give it a 5 STARS but I added more to it the recipe so it's almost a whole different recipe. : / But I love that I found this recipe as a starting off point because I've never liked candied yams but now I do. Made this for 3 years now. 
HERE IS MY VERSION:
I used FRESH yams and microwave or bake them. Per other peoples instructions I added more butter and more brown sugar plus other spices so it looks like this: 
1/2 cup butter, 3/4 brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ginger. I combine everything w/the fresh cooked cut yams and let it sit in fridge for 2 hours or whatever time I have. Then bake it with a handful of marshmallows on top for 25 minutes. Then add more marshmallows allover the top and bake another 5 minutes or so and check often until they are golden brown. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. 
- Thank you for this recipe.  Cynthia

I don't even like yams but made them 2 ways this year for Thanksgiving.   I don't even like marshmallows, but I loved this recipe!  It is super easy, 4 steps!   And the marshmallows are so good on top when they are crispy! I wish I had taken a picture!!

They say you can use fresh yams but fresh yams need to cook much longer than canned , if you let the fresh yams cook the marshmallows are completely burned by the time they’re done.  I don’t know why they don’t mention this in the video seems simple things and important thing to add

I kicked it up by adding a little heavy cream, used maple surup instead of vanilla and threw in some bourbon for good measure. I also added whole pecans on the top to dress it up. Based on the empty disn and raved reports I'll definitely make it again.

Recipe was easy to follow: except I left  the marshmallows out and I added 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Baked as recommended and it was a hit- My 10 year old son had some for breakfast the following morning with smoked turkey we had for Thanksgiving the previous day ;-)

I used fresh yams (remember to drain them, especially with canned yams) and it turned out excellent! I plan to make this again next Thanksgiving :) 

NOTE: This recipe is even better when you add cinnamon with the brown sugar!

I would make it again.  I ended up with a lot of syrup so I think I'm going to drain more liquid from the can.  I used half a can of fluid figuring evaporation...maybe a quarter can would be better.

This recipe is fantastic! However, I did choose to use the 40oz can of yams instead. I just added alittle bit more of each ingredient and all turned out fine. I also added some cinnamon as other reviewers suggested which was a nice touch. Remember to drain your yams!

Absolutely delicious! I used fresh baby yams cut up with skins left on, boiled for 15/20 minutes, and then added some cinnamon and vanilla before baking as suggested by another reviewer. Best candied yams I've had! :D

I made this for the first time this past thanksgiving. I’ve made it again since then when I just want a little taste of thanksgiving. I’ve
made it exactly as written and it’s yummy.
This thanksgiving I took another reviewers advice and mashed the yams, melted the butter and brown sugar on the stove and poured it on top.
Sprinkled cinnamon and layered marshmallows.
I loved it!!

This recipe has been on our Thanksgiving table for years. The one year I didn't make it my children had a fit. This year my oldest daughter made it and has decided to take it on as her contribution to our dinner. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without this!

A keeper! Super easy to make and to customize to your liking. I use sweet potatoes or yams cut up in bite size pieces (cooked and peeled first) and add cinnamon sprinkled over the entire thing after I put the butter pieces in. I think it is much better with fresh potatoes or yams, canned in syrup would be too sweet and have too much liquid.

Made these using baked sweet potatoes lightly mashed. I added the cinnamon, used a bit less butter and sugar. It cooked perfectly. Marshmallows browned nicely on top and did not get runny. Will use this recipe again.

I have made this several times now and it's so good. Definitely drain the cans before adding them. I also added cinnamon, and pumpkin spice to it as well. I also waited until the last 7 minutes to add the marshmallows.  Everyone loved them.

My daughter LOVED this, but in all honesty , I really did not like how this came out. If I make this again,  I will make adjustments and add the  marshmallows  in the  last maybe 5-10 minutes  of  it being in the oven, because the marshmallows were so hard after being in the entire 25 minutes (as suggested by the recipe).

Amazing! Needed the cinnamon and to be mashed before putting in the oven. I mixed the yams with the cinnamon and brown sugar to coat all of it evenly and didn’t even put the butter in. It doesn’t need the butter. Also I baked mine with foil for 20 mins and then I added the marshmallows after and returned to oven for another 10 mins.

This was good but if you use canned yams you should definitely drain them all the way, which wasn't specified. I left a little bit of the liquid so they didn't dry out and it ended up being a buttery soupy mess. To be honest, I think this would be just as good without the butter or with very little.

Super easy. I took a previous reviewer's recommendations and drained the syrup out of the cans before using the potatoes, mashed up the potatoes slightly, and added a dash of cinnamon. This dish gotten eaten up fast!

My family has been making this yummy recipe for years.  However, we make it praline-style by adding flaked coconut and chopped pecans.  Can't wait for Thanksgiving!

I cook the yams a little first then drain the pan. I like to use allspice and add pineapple chunks and dates along with the marshmallows and brown sugar for my personal recipe.

Love these.  This is the recipe I use when I am wanting a sweeet  version of Sweet Potatoes or yams.  I usually have these on Thanksgiving.  I used fresh sweet potatoes and put in microwave so they would be easy to peel and mash.

Followed the recipe, but made some small changes. I added a bit more sugar and added sugar. I baked the yams and sugar in the oven for about 10 minutes and then added the marshmallows. It came out great!

Yummy recipe! Smashed and cutted the yams a bit to make them completely spread out and it also baked them better. I also added cinnamon after the butter. Since I had large marshmallows, i had to cut them in half to get that gooeyness :)

This tastes good but has room for improvement.  I will make it again but drain the canned yam juice into a bowl, use more mini marshmallows (or even regular sized ones) and make sure they're packed together, and sprinkle cinnamon over the brown sugar before I put the marshmallows on.  If you don't think there will be enough syrup, spoon only a little bit of reserved juice over it before you add the marshmallows.  Also, cover with foil and remove it in the last 5-10 minutes of cook time so the marshmallows don't char.

This was a very easy recipe however I made a few modifications. I used 4 large sweet potatoes. Make sure to drain thoroughly. I added cinnamon and nutmeg. About a tablespoon of each. I baked for 15 minutes and the marshmallows were perfect. These were a hit on thanksgiving. My husband requested I make on a regular basis.

This was delicious.  The only thing I changed was that I blended the yams thoroughly with a mixer, to where they were a paste like consistency.  I used the canned candied yams.

I added about a tbsp of cinnamon, baked it for 15 minutes THEN added the marshmallows, to keep them from burning, for an additional 10 minutes. Turned out wonderful and everyone loved them including my husband who typical detests yams.

Was a total hit!!  Will make it again and again!! Will double recipe next time. Just drain the can of yams,  do a slight mash of them with fork, slice margarine and lay over them- definitely suggest adding cinnamon to this, just sprinkle over margarine, then sprinkle the brown sugar - cook uncovered 20 minutes, take out and add layer of miniature marshmallows for 10 minutes or golden brown!!!

Make it using the recipe and the recommendations of the other home cooks (added cinnamon, drained the sweet potatoes) and it was a hit at all three parties to which I took it! All kinds of yummy and no left overs because it was so good.

I used real sweet potatoes (boiled & skinned first).
I've never made sweet potatoes in any way,shape or form...haha! This was so easy and so yummy, that I plan on making smaller servings & freezing them. I'll just add the marshmallows as needed!

This reminded me of what my grandma used to make, I used Freysh yams and the daughter it turned out great but because they were fresh it took longer to cook almost an hour which was fine I was in no hurry . Next time I might boil them for 15 min. First. I only had about 1 small serving left.

Good stuff... I added a small can of crushed pineapple w/juice. Mixed the brown sugar with the pineapple and then poured over the top. Then added the butter and marshmallows... My juices caramelized... I didn't add cinnamon. Like previously stated watch the time.

I read the review before where the person wrote this  was horrible that it was soupy. I'm an avid cook and have made  sweet potato casserole for years.  I don't know what happened however it turned  soupy. I'm thinking this might be  good at best if only fresh sweet potatoes were used.

This recipe is super easy. I mash all the ingredients together in the mixer, and I add about 10 oz of strained crushed pineapple to the mix. I wait until the last 5 minutes to put on the marshmallows. Delicious! Even better cold the next day!

This was the dish my husband craved from the holidays of his childhood.  It was simple and very good. I didn't change a thing. But don't rush like I did the first time. Be sure to preheat the oven so the marshmallows don't over-brown.

I looked at the most helpful reviews so I knew to drain the yams but the cooking time with the marshmallows on top is way too long and the marshmallows burn if cooked the way the recipe says.

This is the same recipe I've been using for years, except that you must drain have the juice from the can of yams, otherwise, everything is too soggy. And I put the mini marshmallows on at the end and just let them brown a little and melt. Otherwise, they will soak into the juice and melt away. Careful to pay attention to them, though, because they can poof up right over the edge of your pan!

Heat setting was entirely too high. Next I'll put it at 300-350 degrees. I also added a layer of cinnamon on top before I covered the yams in marshmallows.

My husband really liked this.  I made a half batch I added just a sprinkle of cinnamon under the marshmallow layer.  I melted the butter and lightly mashed the potatoes with the butter and the sugar.  Good stuff!

I followed the recipe exactly and these were very good and extremely easy, just what I was looking for. I had reservations about using canned yams, but because I wanted to spend more time on other dishes, I went through with the canned, was well worth it. Good, simple recipe

I normally make stove top candied yams but I gave this one a try.  It was easier and less time consuming.  I used the canned yams.   I made as directed with one exception.  I sprinkled vanilla extract and cinnamon on the yams before the brown sugar.   Turned out perfect.  I also only baked for 25mins since I used silicon pan.

Fantastic and much easier than other types I've made in the past. Remember to drain the yams first! Recipe doesn't indicate that. I used mini marshmallows and added near the end. They browned nicely and were super yummy.

Never any leftovers.  Even when I've doubled the batch.  Hint: cook the dish and then add the marshmallows last so they don't melt in.

Made this last year. After coarsely mashing the yams, I added a little bit of crushed walnuts to give some texture. I also added cinnamon.I am told to make this recipe every year now. Two thumbs up.

The kids loved this! I only used 1/4 cups of brown sugar and large marshmallows (I ran out of small ones).  Also, I waited until close to the end to put the marshmallows in.  This way it was soft on the inside, yet brown and crunchy on top.

Great recipe. Very simple and quick, which I like. However, I did double the recipe and layer the ingredients. Yams, butter pieces, cinnamon sugar, then mini marshmallows. Let it sit for about 10 minutes to thicken.

I love making yams! My secret is I add a little bit of nutmeg along with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Too much nutmeg can be overpowering so just a little and it's perfect!

Way too much liquid. Marshmallows were swimming, not browning. Maybe using less butter would help? Also I don't consider this a side dish. It is so sweet, it's a dessert! But maybe that's just me.

Great recipe. Thanks. I sliced my yams and instead of using vanilla or rum flavoring, I used Watkins Pumpkin Spice. Yummy!

It was simple and tasted fantastic! Next time, I may add a few breadcrumbs for a 'pasty' finish rather than 'liquid'. :))

Made this for Thanksgiving and my husband really enjoyed this and asked me to make it again. I did cook my fresh yams for 15 minutes on the stove before baking them in the oven with butter, brown sugar, and marshmalllows. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to this recipe and cooked for an additional 20 minutes for ultimate tenderness.  My marhmallows melted too quickly while cooking so I just added more to the mixture in the last 20 minutes of baking. Overall I think its a good recipe I would reccomend it to family and friends.

This was just ok. You could have use 1/8 of a cup of sugar and it would still be too sweet.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Thank you so much :) I did make a few changes. I added cinnamon and Nutmeg and instead of the 29 ounce of Yams I used the 40 oz Can of bruces yams. Thanks again this dish was a big hit for my mom who has never liked sweet potatoes or Yams.

Not bad, but definitely too much butter as there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the dish. I also peeled, cubed and steamed actual sweet potatoes (I use fresh ingredients as much as possible), used a bit less brown sugar and added some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Next time, I'll only use about 1 tbsp of butter and maybe roast the sweet potatoes instead of steaming them.

I drain the yams and mash them up with the butter first.  Layer the ingredients in your casserole dish, but add a drained can of pineapples before the marshmallows.  I prefer regular marshmallows also.

Quick and simple that reminded my of childhood.  I baked the potatoes in the oven first just because I prefer fresh potatoes and it is easier to remove jackets without waste.  Also, I sprinkled allspice over the potatoes--not because anything was lacking in the recipe--but because that was what I remembered from childhood--the spiciness of the potatoes.  This recipe should always be a hit.  It's almost impossible to mess this one up!  :)

Made fresh yams in the microwave, cut into bite size peices
Melted butter in med oven pan, 3/4 stick, put yams into pan, tossed, 
Sprinkles with cinnamon and brown sugar, poured @ 3/4 cup of 
Orange juice 2/3 bag of mini marshmallows.Baked  and 
Was the best candied yams I have ever made, because, it wasn't over processed.
You could taste the real yam and the other flavors with it. Outstanding!

I tried this recipe with a change or two. I drained the yams and added honey on top of the butter and brown sugar to help the yams stick to the marshmallows a bit better. It worked like a charm. Once I pulled the yams out of the oven the marshmallows were all on top and fluffy with a nice golden/brown color to the tops of them. This recipe was a huge hit with my family!

These are very tasty!  One important thing to note:  don't use canned sweet potatoes IN SYRUP. Use the ones in their own juice.  I used the ones in syrup and these were really, really sweet (even for me, who LOVES sweets!)  I also sprinkled about 1/3 cup of pecans on top of the sweet potatoes before I topped them with marshmallows and baked them.  Added a nice little crunch.

Excellent Recipe.   I usually make fresh candied yams, but these were great!!   I might try with fresh yams as the base next year, but this is really fast and easy... plus, tastes great!!  The only thing I did differently was forget to cover the dish when cooking.   It still turned out great, but was done in 20 minutes.

First thing is you must drain the yams or else they will come out to wet. Although I drained the yams there were still a few problems with them. I try adding cinnamon for flavor so that made them better however I found that there was way to much butter for such a small amount of yams and then I also found them way to sweet. I would suggest cutting back on both the butter and brown sugar and then also waiting to add the marshmallows because mine just melted right into the dish and when it came out it looked ugly. After baking the dish I added more marshmallows and let it sit for a few minutes on the counter until they melted. I dont think I will try this dish again because I was simply put off by it

These were delicious. I followed others advice by draining the yams, coarsely mashing them and sprinkling cinnamon. I think they could have less sugar and still be very tasty.

This has to be one of the easiest ways to make Candied Yams.  Excellent.  I use canned yams, drain, and use a potato masher to refine the yams.  I had an aunt tell me that, when you are in a rush, the next best thing to brown sugar is pancake syrup.  Maple is the best.  squeeze a little through after patting in butter and top with small marshmallows.  Excellent! :D

I thought this was too much butter, my potatoes were swimming but over all it was good and very easy to make. I did add cinnamon. I will make again without so much butter. Thanks for sharing.

Followed directions as is.  Nothing special.  I would have no problem making them again, but they did not stand out from other candied yams.  Giving them four stars because they do not deserve three.

This was my first time making candied yams. This recipe was super easy and delicious! I did choose to use large marshmellows, because I made a huge pan to serve 30. I covered the dish w/foil for the entire time specified and only the corners that touched the foil actually browned. So I removed the foil and put it back in the oven until the tops browned. It came out picture perfect!! I also dusted cinnamin like other users suggested. My family could not believe this delicious dish came from a first time cook!

Not a big fan of the way this dish came out. I didn't floow the recipe to the letter, so maybe it was my fault it didn't turn out very nice. I added some sliced pineapple and some walnuts and used the bigger marshmallows instead of the mini ones because that is what I had on hand (though I cut the bigger marshmallows into thirds). But the result was really syrupy and entirely too sweet for everyone at the dinner. We had it on Thanksgiving, so it was nice to have a candied yam dish on the table, but it is definitely not a recipe I will make again. It was easy to make, though, so that was nice. Still, I think I'll keep looking for a different yam recipe. To be fair, it may be much better if you don't try to add nuts and keep to the recipe exactly.

We made these yams for thanksgiving, and thought they turned out a bit bland, and that was adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe with a little extra brown sugar. So I would recommend using plenty of each! Also this recipe makes a very small dish.. if you are making it for a lot of people triple or even quadruple the recipe for a 9x13 pan. Overall, next time I will try another recipe.

Yummy!  I added a dash of cinnamon before the marshmallows.  My marshmallows were stuck together for some reason (they came in a big clump in the package) so I don't think they melted down that pretty but it was still yummy.

This recipe is perfect if you want a quick and extremely easy candied yams casserole.  I made a large thanksgiving dinner and with a new baby did not have time to make my usual homemade sweet potato casserole.  Turned out great!

This was the first time I ever made this. I'm only 21, and this recipe helped me out so much during the holidays. I thank you sooo much for making this so easy for starters.

Great recipe, hit at my christmas meal.  I usually don't make because of the effort.  This was effortless and it all disappeared.

I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving. It was very easy to prepare and most everybody liked it. I personally thought it was a bit too sweet though.

I am not a big fan of yams, but made these for my (very large) family on Thanksgiving and they came out quite liquidy.  Most of the family did not care for them, so I'm sorry I cannot give a great rating.
