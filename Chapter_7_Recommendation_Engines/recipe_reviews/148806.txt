Very good soup but agree with others that twice the amount of mushrooms would be better. Instead of making the roux in a separate pot I just sprinkled the flour over the cooked onions and mushrooms, then added the chicken broth and cream. Worked great and saved me another pot needing to be scrubbed.

This makes a very good soup. However, I used 1.5 times the amount of mushrooms and that still was on the light side. I would at least double the amount of mushrooms. I also added a little more cheese since the flavor was not as bold as I had hoped. Since I had no more gorgonzola, I used 2 tbsps. or Pecorino romano. Also double garlic and sherry. Bottom line, good jumping off point, but needs more punch.

Flavor abounds in this most delicious, simple soup comprised of just enough special ingredients.  I could eat it all myself....and will add this to my next dinner party menu.

Loving it.  I used 2% milk instead of cream, upped the mushrooms (~1.5 lbs...seems like a lot but they soak up so much liquid), added celery.  Also used more herbs -- rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil and bay leaves.

Used just a touch of goat cheese on top, instead of gorgonzola.  Yum!

Perfect. Years ago, I got my husband to eat mushrooms by making mushroom soup. Today, I got him to eat gorgonzola by making mushroom and gorgonzola soup.

This was amazing. we cut the recipe in half yet still ended up using the full amounts of onion/garlic/mushroom; double them all, it will add more depth of flavor. I also used half the amount of half and half and made up for it with greek yogurt- still creamy and delicious, just a little healthier. Will definitely make again, and maybe with a little thyme next time.

Absolutely LOVE this soup! The addition of Gorgonzola is inspired and lends an incredible dimension to the recipe.  Have made it several times, to raves each time. Like many of the other comments, I doubled the amount of mushrooms and used Crimini and Baby Portabellos for a deeper richness of flavor.  Homemade chicken stock, more garlic, sherry and a bit more Gorgonzola just perfect this recipe. More soup recipes please, "Bunchkin"!

This soup is amazing!  I followed another reviewers advice and sprinkled the flour over the onion, garlic and mushroom mixture, and then added the other ingredients.  I also think the mushrooms could be doubled but it was still delicious!

Loved this and stayed pretty close to the recipe. I increased the sherry to dilute the gorgonzola's strong flavor. It's a good foundation to grow from. Thanks for sharing!

I made this soup for the soup of the day at my restaurant and got lots of compliments.  I made only minore tweaks such as instead of chicken broth or stock i used mushroom base not only making it a vegetarian option but it popped the mushroom flavor and I garnished it with Maytag blue cheese and herbs (rosemary sage and parsley). I will definitely add this to my future soup line up......

Really liked this. Made some modifications.  Used 1% milk instead of cream for calories' sake.  Followed other recommendations and added more mushrooms:  1 8 oz bag of white mushrooms, one 8 oz bag of cremini mushrooms and a package of Shitakes.  Could even use more.  Perhaps would decrease the rosemary next time, as it was very strong.  But there will be a next time!

Having tasted a similar soup a few weeks ago I decided I wanted to make it at home. I found this recipe to use as a baseline. That said, I made several changes, including using homemade vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

After reading the comments I added double the amount of mushrooms. Perfect. 

I used milk, fresh rosemary, and omitted the salt (there's plenty in the butter and cheese). If people want more they can add it at serving time. 

Overall, loved this soup. Hubby says it can go in my file for regular menu ideas.

2.20.20 Found mushrooms on sale for $1.98 a pound, so it was time to make mushroom soup, one of our favorites. The soup's texture was pretty thin, so I did thicken it a little.  Just a comment about making the flour-butter roux.  If you cook that for 5 minutes over medium-high heat, you’ll have a burnt mess on your hands, simply doesn’t take that long.  Just keep your eye on it and when you see that golden brown color, add your liquid to the pot, and start stirring.  I chose not to put any of the soup in the blender (just personal preference). The gorgonzola adds a very interesting and rich layer of flavor, one that I've never had before in mushroom soup.   I must say, this soup is very, very good even using fat-free half-and-half.  Looks like this recipe has been around for a while, and I’m glad I found it because it’s one that I will make again.

made it with gorganzola and it was great.  
second time I made it, I used shaggy manes and
chantrelles and added parmesan/asiago grated
as I was out of gorgonzola.  Great both ways.
I do think a little dry white wine makes it a bit better though.

Soooo good!  I used more mushrooms and I'm trying to cut my carb intake, so I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and skipped the flour.  This'll be a regular for me.

This is the first time I ever made a soup from scratch and it was easier and far less intimidating than I thought. I used two 8 oz containers of portobello mushrooms and it was enough. I also used crumbled blue cheese, although I then realized I'm not a huge fan of the biting flavor. I'd say that was the only downside, but that's my preference. Maybe next time I'll used a milder cheese.

This is delicious!!! I didn't have chicken stock so I used beef "better than boullion" and it was delish! I may have overdone the rosemary and I would lower the salt to none-1/4 tsp. it was probably the extra salt from the boullion.

Minor changes - 1.5 lbs of mushrooms, added flour right to mushroom mixture as suggested, used fresh rosemary and 1% milk. It was delicious and rich enough without the fat of half-n-half. This is a keeper!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!!!
I forgot the sherry and used Greek yogurt instead of half-and-half, margarine instead of butter, forgot the parsley and doubled the mushrooms.
I wanted to see how it tasted with and without the cheese, but with the cheese, it was unbelievable!  I did put in too much, so some lemon juice helped tone down the aftertaste.  This one is going to be a staple!!

Just made this for dinner and loved it!  I did use 1.5 pounds of mushrooms and a whole onion.  The flavors were really good, so homey and comforting.  Will definitely make this again.  Might add more blue cheese.
