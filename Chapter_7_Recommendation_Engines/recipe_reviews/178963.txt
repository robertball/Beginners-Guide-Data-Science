I have no idea if the steak was so good from the picante or the cooking but this was SO tender. Cooked sirloin on the grill- low heat to sear and then indirect heat for about 25 minutes- SO tender.  Used about 8 oz of the hot picante!

Take this over the top and marinate your beef steak or boneless skinless chicken breasts in a mixture of 1 cup Pace, 1/4 cup canola oil, juice of one lime and a minced garlic clove. I take my chicken out the day before and put in a ziploc with the marinade. As it defrosts in the frig it takes on the flavor. Grill the chicken, slice thinly and serve with fresh flour tortillas and sauteed crisp tender bell pepper and onions. Home made fajitas.....yummy and serve with some Mexican or Spanish rice, sour cream and pico de gallo. Borracho beans also make a great side dish.  I got the marinade recipe from a Pace magazine advertisement and the rest of the meal after eating at some great Tex-Mex restaurants in Colorado.  The marinade tenderizes the meat due to the acid in the tomato and lime. Don't skip the oil, your chicken will turn out dry. Enjoy!

I was not feeling well this morning, so I threw this with a drained can of kernel corn into the crockpot for the family. It shredded wonderfully. They ended up spooning this into tortillas. It was awesome with a little sprinkle of cheddar and some lettuce they found in the frig.

These were ok but they were pretty bland. Next time I will serve them in tortillas with cilantro and extra sauce.
