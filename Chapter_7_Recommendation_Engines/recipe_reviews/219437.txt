I just made these right now.  I used only sucralose instead of sugar for the whole amount as I did not have any sugar on hand.  I also used margarine instead of butter.  These were very tasty.  I think I rolled them too thick so they took about 10 minutes to bake.  These are not too sweet so they were perfect for icing and decorating on. The cookies held up their shape really well.

I'm a huge fan of the original version of these cookies. These didn't hold their shapes quite as well, but still taste wonderful. Stick to simple shapes for this version.
