I've made this twice now using my  clay cooker, not an actual Tagine. And it turned out beautifully delicious! Loved the cilantro as a pot herb, chicken is tender and the dish is very tasty and different. It will be a future favorite. I did not change a thing (except I used 4 skinless chicken thighs both times!)

I loved it.  I cannot say how impressed I was with this recipe.  When it came to placing the caramelized pears into the pot, I also added the resulting juices.

This was really tasty.  I made it in a cast iron dutch oven since I no longer have a tagine.  Cooked the onions right in the dutch oven and then put the chicken on top, per the recipe.   Served it with couscous-quinoa.

We all enjoyed this dish. I made with boneless, skinless, chicken breast fillets, everything else the same.

Great recipe!!  Very good, family enjoyed it!  Used my tangine. 
 Variations due to time available for prep and chicken available in my freezer at the time. I seasoned overnight and I used boneless skinless chicken thighs
