Delicious flavor, but do NOT use 4 cups of flour or they will be dry (like a lot of the reviews have stated). I found that 3 cups is all you need.  The dough is softer and they come out very chewy.  I also subbed 1/4 cup brown sugar because I like a chewier cookie.  I always use some whole wheat flour too.  You can't even tell the difference in this cookie.  Also do NOT overbake.  I baked mine for no longer than 9 mins, and they were just starting to firm up.  That is the perfect time to take them out of the oven.  With less flour and less baking time, they are very chewy and flavorful!

I made this recipe using blackstrap molasses for the molasses and substituted 4 ounces of applesauce for 4 of the tablespoons of butter. It is delicious. I also cooked them for 7 minutes instead of 11 at the recommended temperature.

This dough was very crumbly and hard to work with when rolling the balls for the cookies.  Maybe less flour would help.  They were soft and tasted okay, my 3 year old liked them.

I also found the dough dry, crumbly and difficult to work with. I also found the cookies bland. Not worth the trouble.

i made these with a peach brandy frosting on top, which was excellent.

the cookies were very chewy, which i enjoyed, but as other's have stated- the dough was too hard to work with and too floury they tasted very bland. 

i'll stick to regular crunchy gingersnaps from now on.

These cookies were really tasty, nice and chewy with a bold flavor.  I used a robust molasses, which turned out really nicely.  When I originally made these cookies, I didn't add in the last bit of flour as the recipe states to in step one.  I skipped it, totally accidentally - and at the end I wondered why I had extra flour measured out.  BUT, they turned out beautifully.  Nice and moist and chewy.  I underbaked them slightly on purpose just to ensure they were tender.  Great recipe, am making them again right now to give away as Christmas treats!

Followed the recipe exactly, they were awful. The cookie dough was crumbled and difficult to work. Will not make them again.

i found these cookies a little drier than i thought a 'chewy' cookie should be. 
i also think there is too much flour in this recipe, the dough was rather crumbly.
