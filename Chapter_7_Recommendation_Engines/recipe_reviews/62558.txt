I used a 1-serving packet of the instant coffee granules. It measured almost 2 tsp, and I did use it all.  Even using double the amount of coffee that this recipe calls for, it wasn't overkill. I'd recommend increasing the coffee granule amount to 2 tsp if--like me--you love the flavor of coffee.  I also used a few more ice cubes so it really was a shake-like consistency.  This drink wasn't as sweet as some of the coffee-shop versions, probably because of the use of vanilla rather than the vanilla syrup that the shops use, so I'd probably increase the sugar a bit next time, too.  This drink was great topped with whipped topping drizzled with a bit more chocolate syrup.

Definitely tastes like a frappuccino from Starbucks if you replace the vanilla with Torani brand vanilla which you can find at World Market.  I also add 1/4 cup of mini morsels before I blend to have the "java chip" taste.  Yum!!

YUM! I added a full tablespoon of coffee granules for me, because I like a real eye-opener. This is NOM. I'd make this again for sure. EDITED REVIEW: Now that I've adapted a healthier lifestyle and am eating lighter, I cut the milk back a bit and use either two tablespoons french vanilla flavored sugar free creamer or two tablespoons fat free evaporated milk, my homemade sugar free chocolate syrup and if it's not sweet enough, a couple packets Truvia sweetener. It's every bit as good as the full fat version.

Very good, and so easy (AND much more cheap than a fancy coffee shops!) I used a little less sugar, but followed the suggestion of adding mini-chips. I also added some more ice and instant coffee. No matter what you do, this is great. I made a little to much, so I put the extra in the freezer (maybe 20 min), then decided I wanted the rest, and by then it was nice a slushy.. even better :)

Loved this, I used skim milk, sugar free chocolate syrup, and french vanilla slenda since I am watching my calories. I also added some instant french vanilla cappucino.

This is basically my standard recipe except the vanilla, which is a delicious addition!  I used 2 tsp sugar, 2 Tbsp of hot chocolate (drinking cocoa) powder instead of the syrup.   HINT:  For any blender drink with white sugar, add the sugar to the blender FIRST and run it for a bit dry - it will pulverize into superfine sugar which dissolves beautifully into drinks for a more professional texture.

Very Good!  I doubled the recipe, used Splenda instead of sugar, used only 1/2 of the vanilla, and added 2tbsp of Ovaltine and it was wonderful.  I bet it would be even better with chocolate syrup so I'll try it again after I go shopping!  :-p

OMGosh!! This is amazing!! I double it (of course!!) and use 1% milk, Sweet 'n' Low, and a splash of hazelnut creamer. I drank Starbucks Frappuccinos 3-5 times per week and I have saved a fortune since I found this recipe!

Very refreshing. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and a little extra chocolate syrup drizzled inside of the glass. It was delicious.

i haven't tried this one yet. however one suggestion i could make would be to make ice cubes with very strong coffee instead of plain water. gives it a strong taste and use frozen yoghurt instead of sugar and vanilla. tastes just like a Tim Hortons Iced Cap

after reading some reviews i decided to up the coffee to two tsp. It was a little bit strong for me, so next time i'll just do 1tsp. I did add the chocolate syrup and a splash of hazelnut creamer. It does taste like a coffee drink you'd buy.

I made a few small changes.  3/4 cup fat free milk, 1 tbsp coffee granules, a tiny bit of sugar and some caramel syrup.  This really is very close to the way a frappuccino from Starbucks tastes and I am saving a ton of money!!!!

I love this drink.  I made this exactly as written but used skim milk instead of whole, splenda instead of sugar and sugar free chocolate syrup.  You can have this drink for a little less than 70 calories!!  This is great for those of us watching our weight.

THIS TASTES SO MUCH LIKE STARBUCKS FROZEN DRINKS. I found that up to 3 times the recipe will fit into a standard blender at a time. The main difference between this recipe and the coffee shops is this one was a lot less sweet, which is something I didn't care for with the coffee shops frozen coffees anyway. I used 2% low-fat milk and lite chocolate syrup. It does melt or thin pretty quickly so it has to be made right then. But, the liquid part could be made ahead a time like the coffee shops do and the ice could be added later. Try it topped with whipped cream and some caramel, so good! Thanks

Yummy yummy yummy! Used 1 tablespoon coffee granules and 1 tablespoon sugar, Torani vanilla syrup, eight ice cubes and Hershey's syrup. There is no Starbucks on the island, so I put it in my plastic Starbucks cup and fooled my craving.

Yay finally figured it out.  I had been using fresh coffee to try and make a blended drink - the instant granules work so much better!  Very tasty.

Really delicious.  I used Starbuck's Via Italian Roast decaf, could probably be even richer with an espresso Via.  I was out of Splenda but will use that next time.

Very good!!!!  Add 2 teaspoons of coffee granules as others have suggested, and a little more sugar.  Good strong coffee taste.

Whenever I make an iced coffee at home, I have to make it in my Starbucks coffee cup.  Then everytime I see it, it makes me think about all the money I'm saving every morning.  This is good, but the "easy iced coffee" from this site is easier to make, no blender to wash afterwards. I used FF skim milk, a packet of Equal and zero chocolate syrup.

I used my leftover coffee and froze it in ice trays instead of buying instant coffee and adding ice cubes.  I also used Splenda and light chocolate syrup. This was delicious!

Pretty tasty, I can see myself making this a lot in the summer. I also doubled the instant coffee, and it could even use more. I think it could be perfected by finding the perfect type of milk, the perfect chocolate syrup, etc. I used 1% milk, nesquik rolo syrup, and real vanilla. Gonna try soy milk next time!

Although i did tweak it a little, Im sure the original would have been great! I put 1/4 cup of french vanilla capuccino instead of coffee, and put one packet of sweet n low (the cap. was already pretty sweet) and added 2 tablespoons of chocolate nestle quick! TASTED JUST LIKE THE CAFE VANILLA AT STARBUCKS!

This tastes like a Starbucks Java Chip Frappe! Very good! I tried it without the chocolate syrup and deeply regretted it! It needs the chocolate. I'd add just one more ice cube and a tad bit more sugar and instant coffee. Delicious!

I used ice cream instead of ice cubes for a creamier taste, and a hazelnut flavored coffee mix, and since i didn't have any chocolate syrup, i used hot chocolate mix. I might have changed the recipe all together but it was delicious!

To use my daughter's phrase--this is "shamazing"!!!!!!  I will never get Starbuck's frappacino again.    I didn't have any chocolate syrup on hand so I substituted 2 tsp of chocolate milk mix.  It was fantastic.  I will probably add just a little more coffee--maybe half a tsp more next time.

Not bad! It takes almost exactly like a Starbucks frappuccino. But I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used coconut flavor instead. And the coconut flavor made it taste like Starbuck's coconut frapp! This is a drink I will definitely be using for my early mornings.

This was AWESOME. I used Folgers French Vanilla Cap. instead of instant coffee. Next time I will cut sugar back to 1tsp or maybe none as the Cap. has plenty already. This recipe is definatley a keeper!

So simple to make, and so refreshing! I used a little less vanilla, 1% milk and Sweet N' Low instead of sugar. I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what percent milk you use, or sweetener. It was 100F today, and this shake was sooo tasty---and so much more economical than the coffee house drinks!

Nice and easy recipe! I substituted 1 Tbsp instant espresso (the little bottle of Italian import awesomeness) and used Ephmere chocolate sauce which isn't sweet.  Next time I'll add another Tbsp of espresso, though.  Thanks to this recipe, I won't need to hit up the Starbucks across the street from my place. =)

I love this recipe! I did alter it the 2nd time though because I had some frozen yogurt that I needed to use up. I like strong coffee to so I put more coffee in it. I used 1 tablespoon coffee, 1/2 c milk, 3 ice cubes, and about 1 scoop frozen vanilla yogurt. I kept everything else the same.

1/11/2010 Not enough coffee flavor for me as is.  I used 1 T. instant coffee and 1 T. sugar and it was much better.   I also had to add 2 extra ice cubes.  Will substitute Splenda for sugar next time.      6-9-2016 Since I like my coffee strong, I used an entire packet of Starbuck's Via Decaf Dark Italian Roast to 3/4 cup almond milk. Of course, much more sweetener was needed. I used a stevia blend. Still needed 2 extra ice cubes.

Enjoyed the coffee shake, tasted just like coffee shake at Starbucks.  I modified recipe as I am a diabetic and WW member.  Used 1 packet of WW French Vanilla powder, sugar free French Vanilla CoffeeMate cream, and Splenda instead of sugar.   I've also used Hershey's sugar free chocolate syrup instead of the CoffeeMate.  YUMMIE.

Needs more coffee- more ice- more sugar! But then it was good. I didn't have syrup so I added a small handful of chocolate chips.  Second cup: I substituted a packet of hot chocolate mix for the sugar/chocolate and put in two packets of granuals- Yum!

I was out of chocolate syrup so I didn't use that. I also used more milk, more coffee (1.33 tsp) and less vanilla. I tried it and it tasted too bitter and less shake like. So I added 4 ice cubes and 1 extra teaspoon. Delicious, but 4 stars for needing so many adjustments.

I used a whole packet of instant coffee granules also. I did not have any vanilla extract, so I used a French vanilla syrup from Torani. It could use some more coffee or syrup. I will definitely try this again.

This was good, just didn’t wow me. Instead of chocolate syrup that I didn’t have, I added 1/2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder, plus an extra 1/2 tsp sugar to compensate for that. My mom really liked it though, and said it tasted like “melted ice cream.”

Preferred it with the chocolate syrup, and even tried it with a banana to make it thicker.

I use 1/2 tbsp for everything instead of tsp.  Half irish cream/half milk.  About 16 of our smaller ice cubes.  My favorite warm weather coffee drink! Been making this for years.  Sometimes I make one for the kids using just milk  (obviously) and hot chocolate mix. They love it.

Do you feel fatigued or exhausted every single second or everyday?  I wasn't anymore after drinking this. This shake really caught my eye with all the good feedback and the large amount of people that made it.  I added a couple of plain vanilla ice cream to give it  a more shake-like texture. Also, I added a couple less coffee granules and was afraid the shake would be overpowered with sugar, but the coffee flavor replaced the sugar level.I don't really favor drinking coffee, but overall this shake was pretty good. I didn't love or loath it and I would recommend it to people that like coffee. I think it would be better if they added something healthy to it as well. This admired coffee shake was one of the favorites for many people.

I didn't have any instant coffee so instead I froze very strong, brewed coffee into ice cubes. I also substituted vanilla syrup for the vanilla, sugar, and chocolate syrup. I then blended the ice cubes with the remaining ingredients. The consistency and taste were very good. Will most definitely be making this again.

This was delicious. Easy and fast, it gave me exactly the results my sister and I wanted. I did change the recipe a bit: I omitted all of the sugar and half the vanilla extract it suggested, and it turned out great. I'll be using this for a long time. Thanks!

Yum! I really hate coffee but I really loved this! I used a little bit of vanilla bean seeds instead of vanilla extract though since I cant have vanilla extract. I also drizzled chocolate syrup over the top of the drink when it was done. Thanks for the recipe!

I love frozen coffee drinks, its sort of like my dessert. It's even better when I can find low-calorie ways to do it.

I prefer my coffee stronger so I used 2 teaspoons of instant coffee, 3/4 cup non-fat milk, 2 tbsp of fat-free vanilla creamer,  packets of truvia, and about 10-15 ice cubes. It comes out much thicker than the original recipe (which is my preference, also why I only gave 4 stars) and it has a more coffee flavor. Enjoy :)

I've been doing this for years. I don't use vanilla or chocolate, but use splenda and instant expresso like Pilon or Cafe Bustelo.  Unless it's really cold outside, this is my Florida wake up! I use Almond unsweetened milk as I'm diabetic.

This recipe is awesome! I wanted to save myself some calories and guilt by using vanilla flavored almond milk instead of regular milk and splenda instead of sugar.  I didn't have any chocolate syrup, and I'm sure it would be great, but I honestly didn't miss it. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!! :-)

I think this was better with a little bit more chocolate (I love chocolate :P), but it was really good. If you don't like coffee shakes to taste too much like coffee, I recomend puting a little less coffee granules. All in all, a very good shake. Thanks for posting!!

This tastes so much better than the one's you buy. I added splenda and fat free milk and it was terrific. Could get addicted to it easily.

This was a yummy, no guilt treat.  I used skim milk, decaf instant coffee, 1 pkt Splenda and sf/ff chocolate Hersheys.  Very tasty and hit the spot on this hot day!

Yep! double the coffee to 2 Tbsp's of course! try it with some real chocolate too. Just a splash of vanilla so it doesn't drown the flavor. Top it off with some whipped cream and a few dashes of cinnamon and you have yourself one of those fancy $5 starbucks mocha latte cinnamon frappuccino's at a fraction of the price! Sweet!

Frap-a-licious! I used 1/2 cup light vanilla soy milk, increased the coffee to about a tablespoon and used Splenda instead of sugar. It was low fat and low cal, but tasted great! I'll definitely make this again and often. Thanks for the great recipe!!

My husband is the coffee drinker.... and he gave it a 5! Only change was we don't have ice cubes and using Lactaid (nondairy) milk. oh! also, no chocolate syrup. To us, the 'sweetness' was fine. Stirred it with a drink frother and it looked and tasted great!

I felt it was a tad sweet, but otherwise it was great!  I recommend using milk with some fat in it so that it tastes creamier.  I didn't blend it, so I just stuck in the ice cubs and let it sit for a while to melt into the coffee.  Adding a dash of cinnamon makes it nice too!

Wow, this was great.  I tried to put chocolate chips in it like other reviewers suggested, but that didn't work out that great.  I also increased the amt of coffee, love the taste.  I also added whipped cream on top.  I can see adding some cinnamon as well.  Thanks Cherries for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  But to make the proper adjustments, to my taste, I used a shot of cold espresso instead of the instant granules and half a shot of creme de cacoa.  PERFECTION!

Both my daughter and I liked it very much. I added an extra teaspoon of chocolate sauce and used raw sugar.

I tweaked this a little. Usually buy the Mocha Joe from Burger King. They just lost a customer and my $.
