I submitted this recipe and wanted to let you know that it tastes even better if you freeze them overnight before serving. It's a very healthy snack or dessert for those days you are craving sugar. Thanks for stopping by!
P.S.: FLAX SEED IS SUPPOSED TO BE GROUND, I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS ON THE RECIPE.
UPDATE 7/15/11: for those of you that asked, but when you buy a container of protein powder, it comes inside a scoop for measurements. Usually 1 scoop is equivalent to 4 Tbsp.

This is a great recipe!  I was looking for a high protein snack for after workouts when I didn't feel like making a smoothie or when I needed a sweet treat without the sugar and this is it.  I used organic crunchy peanut butter but I think this would be also great with smooth peanut butter.  I also think that you could use regular unsweetened cocoa powder if you don't want to use the protein powder or don't have it (a great alternative if you are making this for the kids).  Of course, that decreases the protein, but still provides a healthy snack.  The next time I make these, I will refrigerate the mixture first before I roll into balls because the mixture was very mushy and difficult to make into balls.  No problem, easily fixed, but mine didn't turn out as pretty as the recipe submitter.  They still taste great! Thank you for the recipe!

Not bad and a good way to stave off a cookie/cake craving.  I did skip the flax seed since I didn't have any on hand.  I think it would benefit from a few additions -- maybe mini chocolate chips and/or raisins.

I love these. I've begun just mixing peanut butter, protein powder, honey, and wheat germ. I just stick the bowl in the fridge and snack on it for days.

We love this recipe!  I made it with vanilla whey protein because that's what I had on hand, and it came out great.  I used a melon-baller to make the balls, which helped.  They are fantastic from the freezer (maybe a little TOO good!).

These are great! I used chocolate whey protien powder and mixed in 1-2 mashed bananas for a little sweetness and some carbs. I crushed peanuts and sprinkled over the balls for a little asthetic apeal. I like these best when frozen. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't add the flax seed because I was too anxious to make these and had all the stuff. Not sure about these. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to take them out of the freezer after two hours. Next time I'll keep them in the freezer and only take them out when I want one or two. Might also try one banana, the banana taste was a bit overwhelming, would have liked more of a PB taste. My husband really liked them.

Thank you for this recipe!  We need to avoid sugar for health reasons and this is a great sugar-free, high protein snack and dessert for us.  It tastes delicious, didn't change a thing!  Thanks for the new staple in our nutrition plan.

I used wheat bran instead of flax seeds b/c I was out and vanilla whey protein powder plus 2 tsp cocoa.  I just halved the recipe to try them out & made 41 small balls.  They have a strong banana flavor with a hint of peanut butter.  When I first made these a couple of weeks ago, I thought they were tasty.  They've really grown on me & I LOVE them now!  I only have about 3 sad, lonely guys left in my freezer so I guess I'll have to make more soon!  I bought natural organic peanut butter & flax seeds so I'm ready to rock!

I love these.  I'm not much for sugar or processed food so these are perfect when I actually do have a little sweet craving.  I used vanilla protein powder (it's what I had), 3 bananas and probably doubled the flax seeds, smooth PB (again, what I had) and I thought it needed a little more sweetness and added a tiny squirt of honey, and Ihave added agave nectar too.  I keep them in the freezer all the time.  Also good to grab on the way out the door if you don't eat breakfast.  Thanks for this awesome idea.  I would have never thought of it!!!

My daughter made these and they are good. We like the recipe as-is, but for our taste next time we'll decrease the peanut butter to 1.5 cups to taste the banana more or add another banana. You could also roll these in chopped / ground almonds and as another suggested, add dark chocolate mini chips to the batter. We like them right from the freezer. Thanks for a great snack recipe!

Very good and easy. I halved the recipe since I wasn't sure if I would like them. I did use flax seed meal (ground flax seed) and Designer Whey protein powder. I did think the banana flavor was too much so will halve that next time. They are very good and I will make these often for a before/after workout snack and just as a craving something sweet snack.

LOVE this recipe!  I didn't have they whey powder, so I unfortunately had to substitute ground oats and added some cocoa.  I wanted to make these forever, and had some bananas that were ready for a recipe.  My daughter ate one and said "these are the best things I have ever eaten, seriously!"  I plan on keeping some stocked in the freezer.  They are truly like a bon bon, without the guilt and sugar.  THANKS for a wonderful 'clean' recipe!

I love bananas by themselves, but felt they gave these protein balls an odd taste.  Maybe I'll try applesauce instead next time.  Graet idea, though.

Just made these and the family was eating them before they even made it into the freezer! I had to make a couple of changes just because of my ingredients on hand.  I didn't have any protein powder, so I put in barley flakes and oat bran.  Only had natural pb, so I put in a tbsp of honey.  Can't wait to try them after they've been frozen! Thanks for the recipe! Perfect for the kids. :)

These were really good! I can't say delicious because mine tasted like peanut butter in a solid ball form. I didn't get the taste of banana or chocolate (I'll add more of each next time). I used powdered flax, but possibly there would have been a nutty flax taste if I had used whole. I gave it 5 stars based on nutrition and simplicity. I used a melon baller to scoop out each one and there was no gooeyness. I rolled a few in shredded coconut, which was good. Thanks, Fit&Healthy Mom! It's good to see others sneaking in nutrition. :)

Pretty good I chose to crush up granola and pine seeds and roll them in it before freezing to add a little something.   Currently on p90x so these were nice but the levels of fat and what not I can only have 1 per day.   Doing 50% protein 30% carbs 20% fat. Peanut butter gives very little wiggle room.  Using them for occasion where i just have to have a snack.

These are great! I used vanilla protein powder. (That's what I had on hand). But I did add a tsp of cocoa just to give it a chocolate taste. They are the perfect healthy treat and they curb my craving for something sweet which is just what I need. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

I renamed them "POWER BALLS".  They are a yummy  snack and a great way to consume the the whey protein powder aside from putting it in beverages.  I had vanilla whey protein powder (1 scoop = 4 T) so as others suggested, I added 2 t of Hersheys COCOA POWDER to make it chocolate. I also added about a tablespoon of HONEY.  I'll  try adding WHEAT GERM, OAT BRAN,  next time and CINNAMON to make them even more healthy.  After making the balls I rolled them in an assortment of toppings that I had on hand - dry roasted PEANUTS, ALMONDS, COCONUT, CRANBERRIES, crumbled dark CHOCOLATE candy bar. To keep their shape and avoid them sticking together I froze them on a cookie sheet, then when frozen transferred them to a Ziploc bag to be eaten straight from the freezer.

Delicious!  Used ground flax seeds, which are easier for digestion, and vanilla whey protein powder.  Added some dark chocolate shavings to half the batch for a different flavor.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Decreased PB to 1 cup and added only 1 banana since it was very ripe.  Used Valencia PB with flax seeds.  Will make again and again.  Would also be good with vanilla protein powder.

I love these.  They are really tasty.  I drop one into a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, and it adds just enough flavor to make the oatmeal more exciting.  They are also a great mid-day snack.

I'm rating this high, despite changing the recipe quite a bit.  This is a great idea, love trying to make a healthy recipe that tastes good!  My modifications:  only had vanilla protein powder so I added 2 Tbsp cocoa, used ground flax seed, and substituted some powdered peanut butter to save on fat (new thing I found at the store - it's real peanuts and you just add water .. not bad!)  I think since I didn't use all the real peanut butter, mine are a little more runny, but they're still quite tasty!  I'll be experimenting with different quantities the next time I make this ... so, in other words, will DEFINITELY make again!

Lovely. Exactly what I need for a quick protein boost. Peanut butter is caloric but so great not to use the blender. I cut the recipe in half since I only had one banana. I ended up with 16 nice sized balls.
Math for Protein- If you use 1 cup Muscle Milk Powder/1 cup Organic Peanut Butter from Costco/1 Banana you end up with around 10 grams of protein/10 grams of fat per ball.

These were a hit at my office.  I am trying to get my staff on a healthy snack lifestyle and they loved it.  I used Optimum Nutrion Whey, the double rich choc.  I like this protein because it is low in sugar.  My 6 year old son loved them too.  Kid tested and health nut approved.

One of my first times using/eating bananas. I used regular peanut butter and did not have the whey protein so I used cocoa powder. Popped in the freezer and boy are they good. A nice snack after the gym.

Delicious, simple. These are like healthy banana truffles! I used crunchy almond butter instead of peanut butter (personal preference), added semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, and rolled them in a mixture of brown sugar and cocoa powder. Use really ripe bananas to let that flavor stand out! Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you so much for this amazing idea!  I have been trying to come up with a way to get my oldest daughter to eat whey! And this did the trick!  I didn't have cocoa flavored powder, I have what they labelled as "flavorless", so I used a bit of agave nectar to sweeten it, and  added in some powdered milk to compensate for the stickiness of the agave.  All 3 of my girls loved these, and they are SO simple to make!  Definitely will be making these a lot!

Wow!!  These are great!  After reading the list of ingredients, I wasn't too excited to try this.  Sounded pretty healthy (which means bland in a lot of cases)...these are SO good!  A perfect little punch of protein after my workouts at the gym!

Excellent Idea!  I am on a restricted carb diet at the moment, mostly pertaining to avoiding the starchy carbs and sugar.  I made these with my own spin on them, and they turned out amazing and are definitely okay on my allowed food list!  I used 3 tbsp hemp hearts seed in place of the flax. I added in 4 tbsp medium coconut and 1 tsp cocoa powder along with the 100% whey isolate, peanut butter and banana.  I only used one banana, one cup of the peanut butter and one scoop of the protein powder.  It made 22 balls approximately 1 tbsp each and I entered this recipe into my calorie counter. Turns out each ball contains only a total of 92 calories - 6.8 g fat, 5.5 g carb & 4.1 g protein - very well balanced.  I will definitely make these again.  THANKS Fit&Healthy Mom!

YUM! Halved the recipe to try them first. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter so I added a tbsp of sliced almonds.  Hope my hubby will appreciate them after his hard workouts : )

I gave 3 stars because the banana was funky. I just used peanut butter, and flax and a little bit of oatmeal. I mixed my Designer Whey powder with the peanutbutter of course!

I made a half batch to try, and I liked them. I didn't want a strong banana taste so I only used about half a banana. I used vanilla whey protein powder which I had on hand, and also added a small amount of cocoa powder. I can see adding other things such as mini chocolate chips, as well. A good and healthy snack and easy to make. Thanks Fit&Healthy Mom!

I made these for my sweetheart and he LOVED them! I enjoyed them also, just made my second batch. I made the recipe "as is" and chose chocolate Muscle Mike protein power and it was awesome! I just used a spoon to make each treat portion and did not roll them into balls. Such a yummy healthy snack!

Good base recipe. I used  this recipe and added a little honey, raisins and some quick cook steel cut oats. I eliminated the banana since I had the honey for sweetness. These are yummy!!!!

Awesome!  Messy to make, but tastes GREAT! 

BTW, flaxseeds can be found in the gluten free section at your grocery store.

Also, I'm not sure what that picture is of, but there's no way to make these look like those!

I thought these were going to be good based on reviews but they tasted like balls of semi frozen mush. I wasted expensive ingredients.
I guess I could put them in oatmeal or a smoothie

I read some of the reviews here about the banana being too over powering so when I made mine, I used a full jar of crunchy peanut butter, one banana, chocolate whey protein powder and I added about a tablespoon coconut oil.  I found they were very wet as they were but measures are always difficult when you look at protein powder as each brand has a different scoop size.  When I took them for people to try and found they were very sticky even though they had been in a freezer all night (note I did serve them after a long run so they'd been out of the freezer for about 4 hours but the day wasn't warm).  I have kept the rest in the freezer and will be devouring them bit by bit. I will definitely use this as a base for other protein balls.  Nice clean eating!!

These are Fantastic~ I made 2 kinds ~ First one I used vanilla whey dusted with Cocoa powder. Second was the recipe as directed. They are both wonderful.. These was a good frozen mix to pop in the blender to make a smoothie.

These are delicious. I used the chocolate protein powder I use (a vegetarian whole foods kind). I also used chia seeds instead of flax because it is what I had on hand. I also halved the bananna because mine was reaaally ripe...

My husband I thought these were delicious.  I added a couple dashes of cinnamon as well. I also added a tablespoon of coconut oil and then rolled them in balls and covered with coconut!  We gobbled them up!  I was only able to save a few for the freezer.  I cut the recipe in fourths to see if I liked them.  Then my husband tasted them and wanted to have them all.  I was able to convince him to save three of them for the freezer.  I will have to make full batch next time!

These were yummy!  I used a natural smooth peanut butter as I didn't have any crunchy.  They were quick to put together and throw in the freezer.  Have since eaten them if I need a little pick me up during the day or a treat that's not too sweet but packed with some healthy ingredients!  Can't wait to try again with the crunchy I just bought :)

Most likely, 2 scoops of PP is two servings of whatever kind of PP you are using.  Look on our container.  I used a chocolate egg white protein powder and since I didn't have the scoop anymore, I used my food scale, and measured it out in grams.  If you don't have pp in the house, substitute with dry milk powder; as this is also usually high in protein as well. Just be careful mixing it in, if the milk powder is not instant, it could clump up on you.

I halved the recipe and since I only had 3/4 banana (64g), I added some raw honey (93g), I also added 2 oz of chopped walnuts, 2 oz of salted pistachios and one chopped Chocoperfection dark chocolate bar to the mix.  And instead of adding the flax seed to the mixture, I rolled the balls in ground, black chia seeds, because I wanted to use them up.  Chia, like flax seed needs to be ground up for maximum utilization.  From what I've read on line, Chia is even better than Flax seed, but at more than 4x the cost of Flax seed, it's unlikely that I will get more. 

Despite, my given changes and the adding of honey to my batch, the nutrition information is similar to what is given here.  My yield was 25 balls.  I used a 2T. ice cream scoop as well, so much more uniform.  You can buy different size scoops in restaurant supply stores, like Cash&Carry.  

Even with all that extra honey, my nutritional information on this recipe came very similar to what is stated.

Used regular flax seeds, which added an interesting texture. I think it would be better with milled/ground flax seed. Will be trying again soon!

This is a great snack and here's how I made it.  I followed the  recipe by using one 16 oz jar of  Super Chunk Skippy crunchy peanut butter.   Avoid using natural peanut butter since the oil will make the batter runny.  Don't use over ripe bananas.  I used firm yellow bananas that I mashed up with my fingers.  I used two large scoops of Optimum Whey Double Chocolate Protein powder and several tablespoons of ground flax seed-- an important point that should be in the original recipe (not the whole seeds!)   I added a dash of vanilla flavor and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon.  Mash the bananas first, til a bit creamy, then add all the other ingredients.  You'll find that it turns out like something like cookie dough.  I rolled them into balls and put them on a cookie sheet lined with a silpat mat.  Put  the balls in the freezer for a few hours and you'll have a great treat!

They are a good snack - when you open the freezer, put them above any other thing you might have in there "for the kids" - like ice cream, etc.  It will help you pick the healthy snack.  I did freeze them overnight before I ate one.  It's a lot of calories for a little item, but a good amount of protein.   I added a few cranberries which is a nice burst of flavor if you get a lucky one!

This is very tasty, but I think it's meant for ordinary peanut butter.  I used natural peanut butter, which is thinner than regular peanut butter so it doesn't really clump.  My protein balls wound up being more like a protein gloop that needs to be eaten with a spoon.  Tasty yes, but don't make this with natural peanut butter.

Really solid recipe but the texture is off if you let them get out at room temp.  Makes them a little harder to transport/eat at your desk (priority for me, sadly, heh).

Really liked this recipe!  Used creamy peanut butter so added some chopped almonds to replace the texture missing from the chunky butter....the protein on hand was chocolate sprouted Sun Warrior (vs whey), and my bananas were not terribly ripe.  Since I was chopping up a handful of almonds, decided to throw it all into the food processor...as the peanut butter went in I had second thoughts about the potential gooey mess I was about to make, but it turned into a cookie-dough texture easily and worked great! Had good balance of flavors (not sure if using just ripe bananas toned down the 'naner flavor as some folks found it overwhelming).  Loved them as they were chilling and they are pretty yummy out of the freezer as well....will absolutely make frequently as they are great to have around as a go-to treat, snack, energy/protein boost.  Can't go wrong!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it's one of those 'the sum is greater than the parts' without a doubt!

I loved this recipe, and have tried it with only 1 banana, and with vanilla protein powder.

It does need to be frozen overnight, but its kinda hard to eat.  I kept my in the fridge and liked it a lot more.

I also have used wheat germ instead of the flax and liked the bit of different flavor.

I wanted to do something with my chocolate and vanilla protein powders besides make drinks in the blender.  This is perfect!  It is a good way to use up my stash of frozen bananas. I had flax meal on hand from the Whole Grain Waffles recipe on this site. I make waffle sticks with the waffle recipe.  I toast some waffle sticks and spread the thawed high protein peanut butter balls on top for a quick, perfect breakfast.

Good. Mine got oily but still good.  They are hard to bite into so next time I'll make them bite size. I just used a small cookie scoop since this was quite sticky for hand rolling. I made 32 balls.  Also added mini chocolate chips to mine and ground flax seed.  You cant digest the seeds whole.

Excellent!  I make these weekly.  My kids, myself, and my husband all love them.  1-2 balls is the perfect snack and gets rid of my sweets cravings.  I always add a little dark chocolate to the mixture but the recipe is also great as is!

YUM!! I am on the Daniel Fast right now (can't eat sugar, among other things), so this recipe was exactly what I needed. I used cocoa instead of the protein powder (about 2 Tablespoons). Don't leave out the flax seeds--they add a fantastic crunch. Oh, and this recipe is SUPER easy. Thanks, Fit&Healthy Mom!
