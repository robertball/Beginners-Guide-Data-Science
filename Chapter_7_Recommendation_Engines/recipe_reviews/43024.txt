I did this a little differently.  I didn't want to heat up the house, so I used the crockpot.  I had a 4.5 pound roast, so I doubled the recipe.  Additionally, I doubled the ginger (that makes a total of 2 tsp.) and added one cup of orange juice.  Turned out good.

I had company that was allergic to garlic and onion and wanted to serve something that was special and not bland.  I marinated the roast in the ingredients for a couple of hours and then basted it while it was on the barbeque.  The flavor was fresh and tangy and just right for a hot summer evening meal on the deck with rice and spinach salad.  It went over very well with everyone and we didn't even miss the onion or garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times.  My husband and I love it everytime!  It made the pork roast so juicy and tender.

I have served this several times when company is planned and also just for the two of us!  This works well with Pork Tenderloin also.  I like to serve it with roasted new potatoes or garlic mashed potatoes.  Stuffing, green beans, carrots or a green salad also work well with this dish.

I made this recipe last night and it was WONDERFUL!!
In fact, one of my guests doesn't eat pork so I fixed him a chicken breast using the same ingredients - it was also very good!
Thanks for this recipe!!

Added: For a 3 lb. roast (not loin), I added 1.5 tbsp chopped (jar) ginger (instead of dry), 2 tablespoons soy sauce into marinade, garlic slivers into the roast, which I think made in more exciting.  Added carrots and onion in roasting pan. Either rice or potatos on the side!  Excellent!

Cooked this at the firehouse and it has become a favorite on my cook days.  I use the mixture below but add orange juice to the ingredients.  I poor a modest amount of the marinate over the meat.  Wrap plastic rap over the top of the baking dish, then put aluminum foil over the plastic rap and slow cook for about 6-6 1/2 hours at 250 degrees.  About 1/2 hour before serving time, I remove the about 1/2 of the marinate and then place some of the marmalade on the top of the meat to let it finish cooking.  When cooking for 12 guys it is hard to make them all happy.....except for this one.  Simple and easy and is always good when re-heated if need be!

This was okay but I would have preferred a thicker sauce.  I may try this again without the lemon juice - after cooking my pork was floating in the sauce and it was a mess to serve.

I made the glaze as written, but used it on thick cut boneless pork chops rather than pork roast.  Really enjoyed the taste of glaze, but felt the dish should have been covered while baking.  I served this with "Corn and Rice Medley" from this site and it made for a nice meal.  Thanks CHRISTYJ for sharing your recipe.

This recipe did not go over well with my family. I thought it was OK--but would not bother to make it again. The roast had little flavor--and needed lots more pizazz.

This was awful... I haven't ever left a negative review on a recipe, but this was probably one of the worst things I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and don't know what happened. My husband, who will eat *anything* without complaint, only took two bites. We'll never make this again. Sorry :-\

I used pork loin steaks instead. My husband didn't care for the strong orange flavor but that was just a personal pref. I thought the orange and the ginger worked very well together. I nice change to pork

We are not big pork eaters, but I wanted something different and tried this exactly as written. It is definitely a keeper.  I expected it to be a bit sweeter than it was, and was pleased that it wasn't too sweet.

This was pretty good-instead of using the marmalade mix as a glaze, I think I would use it as a marinade to add more flavor to the pork.

Did anyone else have to cook this much longer?  After 25 min. mine was no where near done.  Didn't get up to 160 degrees until it had been in the oven for at least 45-50 min!  Tast was good when it finally got done.

I agree this was bland. Next time will make small slits in the roast and insert small slivers of ginger and use the marinade injector to inject OJ directly into the roast.

Made additional sauce to apply after serving for a more intense orange flavor while eating slices. (Also very good on a sandwich with leftover slices using the sauce as a spread for the bread!)

Used this glaze over thick, bacon-wrapped pork chops and it was YUMMY!!  :)  LOVE the combination of ginger and orange!  Very easy... just bake with basting every 10 mins or so.  This one is a winner!
