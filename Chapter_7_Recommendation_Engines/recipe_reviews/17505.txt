The dish was simple, quick to prepare and delicious (to those who complained that squash was too hard to cut I'd recommend investing in a good knife - makes life a lot easier)! I added a little cinnamon to it, and it was great. The only thing: there was way too much butter in the recipe! I'll add half of the recommended amount next time. But it's just my personal taste.

Yet another example of "how to make an inherently healthy veggie really, really bad for you..", but freakin' GOOD!  BF loved it, made it using only half a squash (maybe mine was really big, as it filled up a whole bread pan?) but everything e3lse the same and the results were excelllent!!! Cudos, and I will DEFINATELY make this again!

Great Recipe!  We cut our squash into smaller pieces, about 1 inch, which made it cook faster. Also added a little more brown sugar. This is a great alternative to eating the squash mushed, the taste and texture of the squash really comes through, and it's just sweet enough to be everyone's (especially the kiddo's) favorite!

This is great! I have been making my squash this way for years. I cut mine up in about 1" pieces and put it in a microwave dish, cover with plastic wrap (leave a small opening to allow for steam) and microwave. It turns out great and it is a lot quicker than the oven.

Delicious!  I topped the squash with chopped pecans.  I also cooked a bit longer - 40 mins, as I like my squash a bit softer.

This is a really easy, tasty recipe. The only change I will make next time is to cook it a bit longer. I prefer the squash a little softer. Otherwise, excellent recipe. My husband, not a big squash fan, LOVED it!!! (Always good with a veggie recipe!)

I thought this dish had no flavor. I couldn't even eat it. So I added some cinnamon and a drizzle of maple syrup then mashed it all together and it came out great!

This was a simple, tasty recipe for butternut squash.  I used a larger squash, so I had to more than double the cooking time, as well as add extra sugar, butter and salt. I baked it until it was soft and easy to mash. Very tasty!

This was my first attempt at adding butternut squash to my vegetable rotation, and I don't think it made the cut.  Half of a squash cut up filled the bottom of my loaf pan pretty well.  You need a very sharp knife to prepare this, and I cut mine into 1" cubes for my toddler.  It cooked for 26 minutes, because the cubes were smaller.  I think the brown sugar needed to be doubled, personally.  I added a little cinnamon to give it some flavor, but it didn't really add that much.  Overall I thought this was pretty bland.  My toddler wouldn't take more than a nibble, and I'm not picky--but had a hard time eating this as is.

Used half the amount of butter, easy as can be. It was delicious, my 2 year old even liked it! Will definitely make again.

I enjoyed this very much, having made one adjustment.  I did not keep the foil on the whole time as I wanted the sugar to reduce and carmelize the squash.  It was tasty.  But next time I think I'll add some cinnamon to the mix.

Very good, just sweet enough, maybe could use a little less butter.  I also added a little black pepper.  I was looking for a recipe that served squash as a vegetable and not a dessert loaded with sugar and butter.  If you don't like the taste of squash, you might not like this.  I was short on time, so I took one of the reviewers suggestions and microwaved --came out perfect after 10 minutes on high in a covered microwave-safe dish.  Not too firm and not too soft.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is really good, but I like mine with a little more zing. I add a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. It just takes it to a whole new level! I do the same thing with sweet potatoes, even pumpkin!

Delicious, quick and easy.  I found it took much longer to bake so I increased the temp to 400 for a quicker bake.  Of course it all depends on how soft/firm you like your squash.  Great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!  I got it from my Mamaw, although I substitute cinnamon instead of salt.  My husband and son love squash now!  I, too, cook this dish longer as I like the squash softer.

This is so simple and yummy. Thanks for sharing! I nuked the squash for a few minutes so it was easier to peel and cut up.

Great!  We've made this dish several times and it's always fool proof.  Somthing to keep in mind: the comments regarding longer cooking time and difficulty cutting are most likely due to the ripeness of the squash.

you have got to be kidding me 5 minute prep time ?!? did you really cut a raw squash in 5 minutes ? my hands are so sore from cutting ! 35 minute cook time ?!? more like an hour and 35 minutes to get nice squishy squash !
next time im going back to my old recipe to cut the squash in half scoop out the seeds and put the butter and sugar right 
in the shell ! NO MORE SORE HANDS FROM ALL THAT CUTTING ! the amount of sugar and butter was just about right though :)

I used the cubed squash sold in a plastic box at Cosco. Couldn't imagine cubing a  whole squash myself! I put the cubes in a small roaster and added a touch of cinnamon to the recipe. I cooked it 45 min & it came out browner than the picture, fully cooked and sitting in liquid that could have been thickened if desired. I also added a spot of low sugar apricot preserves to top it off on my plate. I love the simplicity & flavor of this recipe!

Plain and simple but delicious.  My only problem was that after 35 minutes, the pieces were still very hard....I did follow the recipe exactly and my oven temp is right on.  After an additional 15 minutes it was perfection

Thanks....tasted much better than boiling

Made this tonight and everyone loved it! I had to use 2 loaf pans because I had such a big squash and added more brown sugar and butter for that reason as well. I also added some chopped pecans because I had them and sprinkled cinnamon on it when finished. Took about an hour to cook but was worth it!! Will definitely be making this again!

What a wonderful dish!  I cut mine in about 1 inch pieces also and YES you do need a sharp knife.  I put mine in a glass lidded casserole dish and baked for 1 hour @ 400 degrees.  I will be making this again all winter!

I used squash that I bought from the grocery store already washed, peeled, and diced.  Saves a lot of time.  My chilren loved this.

This passes the "picky boyfriend" test.  He will not eat any veggies that don't come straight out of the can.  Great recipe, even for the pickiest of eaters!

This takes the "squishiness" out of cooked squash, which means my husband and kids will eat it!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe but requested a little more brown sugar next time.  He did rate it a 5 though.  Made with Lemon-Pepper Salmon II from this site.  Thanks
