My mom has made this recipe for years and we use it on ALL fruit!   She uses grated orange rind (1 Tblsp) instead of orange juice and and 1 Tblsp of ground ginger.  
The best fruit dip I've ever had!

This recipe is fantastic.  It really is best with Tropical Fruit because the ginger is an excellent compliment.

I made this for a party. First I followed the recipe as written, and the dip just tasted like mayo. So, I added another cup of marshmallow creme, a little more orange juice concentrate (maybe 1/4 tsp), and an extra dash of ginger. That sweetened it up a bit and covered up the mayo taste, but it still didn't go over well at the party. All of the fruit was gone, but most of the dip ended up in the garbage.
