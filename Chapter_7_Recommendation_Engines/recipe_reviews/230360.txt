We liked this! I doubled the amount of crescent rolls and made it into a full pot pie with a crescent layer on top and bottom. Also added onion and garlic to the meat and a bit more seasonings like onion powder, basil, Italian stuff. I added probably double the cheese and that was a mistake I think. I love cheesy things, but it ended up tasting like lasagna stuffed garlic bread which isn't what this recipe is for. I definitely plan on making it again and adding a little more veggies and correcting the cheese amount.
