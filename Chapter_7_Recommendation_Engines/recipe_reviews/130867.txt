While I haven't made this,I have had it served to me (now I know where the recipe came from),and it was the worst chili I've ever had.Any true chili lover will tell you that bacon and smoked sausage do NOT belong in chili,not to mention all that sugar.Anyone expecting something that tastes like chili should steer clear of this silliness.

This is a hearty, satisfying meat lovers chili, that makes a batch big enough for the family. Given the amount of meat called for, I found the amount of liquid to be added in the recipe to be insufficient. To remedy that, I added a 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce. (Another 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes would also work) The only other changes made were to add the spices while the onions were sauteeing, rather than after the liquid was added, to allow their flavors to bloom a little, and to add about 2 oz. of chopped bittersweet chocolate, which increased the depth of flavor in the base, and which paired well with the overall flavor profile. A mini food processor made quick work of the chile mincing. A nice recipe.

I'm an advid chili lover and maker. your recipe starts out fabulous but the sugar and beans cut it for me. My husband ask me what I did to my recipe and the kids are a beans and rice not beans and chili.
After taking the beans out and decreasing the sugar to tablespoons, the adjustments had my family liking chili once more. Thanks for the recipe . Will use it again with my adjustments.

I also thought there was a lack of liquid.  And I had a hard time getting past the sweetness from the brown sugar.  I cooked dried pintos rather than using canned beans.  I didn't feel the can of chili beans added anything of special interest.  I also used some chocolate.  And I felt the chili was better after adding double the cumin and also some New Mexico chili powder. After getting past the sweetness and making my adjustments the chili was good.  I really did like the combination of fresh chilies.  It made a huge pot which is good for leftovers.  I definitely will make it again with my adjustments.  It is a good starting point.
