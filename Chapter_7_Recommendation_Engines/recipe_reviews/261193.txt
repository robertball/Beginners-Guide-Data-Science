Something is off with the cooking temperature or the time.  I used small baby potatoes and even quartering them, they weren’t tender after an hour. The chicken was cooked to  165° but was tough. The green beans were the only thing cooked right. 
I ended up throwing it out.

This was good, and super simple.  I think I will try marinating the chicken breasts in italian dressing next time though, as I found them bland with just the butter and dry dressing seasoning.

I have fixed this several times exactly as written and my family loves it. The cooking time was perfect. 
The only time I had a problem was when I forgot to cover it with foil. That time the chicken was dried out and the potatoes were hard as a rock. The green beans were still good though. lol

Turned out perfectly. Nothing was over or under-cooked. I do agree that it needs a little more seasoning than listed, though.

I used garlic instead of the the Italian seasoning on the potatoes and just a little olive oil salt and pepper on the green beans and chicken. Baked one hour and felt the green beans were a little over cooked, so will add them the last half hour next time.  Husband really enjoyed it. Will definitely fix again

I used more taters, cause we love left-overs of this meal!
