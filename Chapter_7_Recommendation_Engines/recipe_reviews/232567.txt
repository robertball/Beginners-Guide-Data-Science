This is definately for mustard lovers, mind you I don't actually measure mustard - I just squirt it and use what suits my family.  I would up the eggs to 4 eggs for 4 sandwiches.

Are you sure about the measurements of the mustard. It was horribly mustardy.

I didn't have any green onion at the time, so I substituted some sweet onion (2 Tbl), minced.    Used for egg salad sandwiches.

I just made this for my lunch and I love this recipe! With the exception of the Dijon mustard and horseradish, it's the closest to what my mother always made, and I absolutely love the  addition of the horseradish. From now on, this will be my go-to recipe for egg salad.

I scaled this down to 1 serving and unlike the first reviewer did not think it had too much mustard.  I didn’t mash the egg, but I did chop finely.  However, I didn’t find anything to really differentiate this from other egg salads that I’ve had.  Horseradish is a distinctive ingredient for egg salad, so you could kick it up by adding more of that, but I didn’t want more horseradish flavor.  It was O.K., just pretty standard egg salad IMO, not that there’s anything wrong with that.
