I have made this twice and was very happy with the results. I did make some changes though. Instead of using oil, I used applesause to keep it low in fat and boost the apple flavor. This last time I made the bread I used almost a cup of applesause and about 1/4 cup of orange juice. It is so good!

Wonderful!  I substituted applesauce for the oil and left out the nuts -- it is great!

I made it a second time and used half brown sugar and half white suger -- it tastes even better!  

Thanks again for a wonderful new recipe!

I love this recipe! However, I did have to change it a bit. The dough was too dry when following the original recipe. I couldn't even get all of the flour to mix in!  So, I just added a little milk and oil, just enough to finish mixing the dry ingredients. It tasted wonderful and I received many compliments! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

this is a wonderful bread!  Although the batter is very thick, this in no way affects the quality.  I would rather have a thick batter where pieces of nuts and apple are suspended throughout evenly, rather than a thin batter where everything sinks to the bottom.  didn't have nuts so used orange infused dried cranberries.  decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 c. using 1 cup white and 1/2 c. brown.  used 1 1/2 cinnamon and 1 tsp apple pie spice. Replaced all the oil w/applesauce.  This is a very moist dense bread, which is not a bad thing at all.  Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea.  If a thick batter is too difficult to work with, just add apples and sugar and let sit.  this will emacerate the apples and leech out the juice.  thanks for this super recipe!

I made this instead of my usual banana bread because I didn't have any bananas but a ton of apples.  I added my Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkle from The Pampered Chef on top before baking it and made 4 mini loaves in the Stoneware mini loaf pan.  I took it to a party that evening and everyone loved it!  Someone thanked me for bringing my apple-y goodness to the party and admitted he ate a whole loaf by himself!  I will definitely include this recipe in my holiday baking this year!  Mini loaves make great gifts!

I don't like banana bread but I like this.  Wow.  I forgot the nuts and I food processed the apple instead of chopping.  Still used 2 cups food processed even though food processing gives more than they probably mean for you to have.  Tasted like it was carmalized on top when I took it out of the oven.  Works to freeze but tastes way better fresh of course.

This is DELICIOUS!  I didn't use nuts, and I used 1 & 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar---even better than as written!  I'll next try Splenda blends for my diabtetic father on his next visit!

We really loved this bread.  I left out the walnuts because of personal preference.  I made a streusel topping for one of loaves and it turned out wonderful!  Yummy!

Once baked, this bread is very heavy and dense. The flavors are just not there.  I will not make this bread again, there are too many other good bread recipes out there.

The dough was too dry at first. I added a cup of applesauce to the mix and then it was perfect. Great flavor.

Everyone LOVED this bread -- I think my parents would have given it 10 stars, they can't wait for the next batch :) -- I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and use applesauce in place of the oil and I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of dark brown sugar and omitted the nuts.

Oh wow! This stuff is amazing. The last thing I wanted to do was make another bland apple bread. So I made as directed minus 2 things. One I subbed the vanilla for pineapple extract. Two: I made a glaze with 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 T water, 1 T of Caramel Machiota Creamer, and 1/4 tsp of pineapple extract. Wonderful results without overpowering the sweet factor. Highly recommend!

I halved this recipe. I increased both the baking soda, baking powder and vanilla extract in this recipe to full teaspoons. I added a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce only because some of the reviewer's had mentioned that the recipe was a bit on the dry side without some kind of additional liquid. I made muffins out of this recipe, getting exactly 12 out of one recipe. Before baking, I sprinkled a little cinnamon-sugar over the top of each muffin. I baked them at 350* for 20 minutes. I'm really glad I added the applesauce--if I hadn't these really would have been dry. My husband and kids ate all 12 this morning, either for breakfast or packed in bag lunches and they all commented that they were good.

This is such a great bread!  And my neighbors think so too.  The only thing I changed was that I used half white sugar & half brown sugar.  I will be making this bread for our annual Fall block party!

Tasty!  But ... downgraded for modifications (gleaned from other reviews).  I added an egg, doubled the oil, and reduced the sugar by one-half cup (and used one-half cup of brown sugar instead of white).  I also took one reviewer's suggestion and used one cup of oatmeal and one cup of whole-wheat flour (in lieu of the called-for three cups of all-purpose flour), but I don't fault the original recipe for not doing this.  The only apples I had on hand were HoneyCrisps -- my favorite out-of-hand apple but not the best baking apple and certainly not tart.  The HoneyCrisps may have made the finished bread a bit sweeter than it might have been, had I used a more "assertive" apple.  The bread is mighty sweet, but texture is fine.

I made this bread exactly as stated in the recipe and it is absolutely delicious! It is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The batter is very stiff - more like a dough - but I didn't add anything to it and it baked perfectly.

LOVED IT! Followed directions to a "t" the first round (only modification was using half white and half wheat flour). Making again right now and substituting oil for applesauce like one review suggested. Can't wait to try!

I thought this turned out very well.  I followed others' advice and used applesauce in place of oil and used half white and half brown sugar.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and moist and had a great apple cinnamon flavor.  I didn't have any problems mixing it (used my Kitchen Aid mixer though) and it was a thick batter, so I could see how mixing it by hand would be difficult.  I'd recommend using a mixer if you have one.  Also, beat the eggs before adding it to the mix.

The mixture of cinnamon and sugar gives it great flavor, but EVERYBODY has had to alter this reciple to make it work!!!  I'm not certain how this recipe is so highly rated -- it mixes up very poorly; usually fruits and nuts are added absolute last - this recipe adds the fruit before mixing the 'wet' with the 'dry,' making it a mess to have to mix.  Also, the batter is very thick/dry/crumbly.  If you follow the instructions as provided, with no alterations, it bakes to a crusty crisp on the outside while becoming a caved in gooey mess on the inside.

This was a great way to use up extra apples we had laying around the house. My boyfriend was a big fan of it- I think it was gone within a day.

Make this recipe with no modifications at your own peril.  I am an experienced baker, and the batter was way too thick and greasy, like a cookie dough.  The final product was almost burnt on the outside, and doughy and raw on the inside.  Way too dense, and much too sweet. Looking back, I should have known if was going to be bad seeing as how the recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar... the proportions just seem way off.  Reading the reviews, I notice that everyone needed to make modifications to make this recipe work for them - to me, this speaks volumes that this recipe does not deserve 4.5 stars.  I will never make this again.

Wow! That was good bread! I used applesauce instead of oil, and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. It was excellent! Froze one loaf, and it still tasted great after defrosting! Next time I'll omit 1/4 cup of the brown sugar because it was plenty sweet. 

Thank You!

What a big mess.  There is not enough liquid for the dry ingredients.  I kept adding oil and applesauce, and broke one spatula, before I could get to a consistency that I could move.

This recipe is a great starting point.  Very tasty but way too dry as written.  I added more than one cup of applesauce and increased the baking time.  The first time I made this bread I used the full 2 cups sugar (brown because I think it has a better flavor in quick breads) and only cinnamon.  The second time I used 1.5 cups brown sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon each cloves and ginger.  Fabulous.  I'll be making this again.

I am only giving this 4 starts since I made changes and don't feel qualified to judge the recipe as it was originally written. 

I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and I used half white sugar and half brown, as opposed to using all white. Also, I do not eat nuts so I used golden raisins instead. I did not find the batter to be too thick, but I do not know if that was due to the applesauce. Either way, the bread was delicious! I will definitely make it again..in fact I am making more tomorrow since I have tons of apples left over from a recent trip to the cider mill. FYI - I'm not sure about the original, but my version is 3 WW+ points per serving.

I'm sure I followed the recipe to a "T" but for some reason this batter was EXTREMELY thick.  The taste is excellent but the texture is heavy and the crust is so hard I must cut it off to enjoy eating the bread.  It's like it needed more liquid of some kind - perhaps another egg or more oil.

I love this bread! It just came out of the oven and it is so delicious! I made a half batch because I only have one loaf pan. The only small change I made was to use half white and half brown sugar. The batter is very thick, but it does all come together just fine.
UPDATE: I made the full recipe today, but made muffins instead. I got 15 and baked for 28 min. I brought them to class and everyone loved them. I love this recipe!

Very good!  I did change it a little out of necessity.  I used whole wheat flour as it was all I had. I substituted the vegetable oil for half applesauce and half olive oil.  I substituted one cup of sugar with brown sugar.  I also added nutmeg since it is a favorite baking spice of mine. The whole wheat flour gave the bread a nice hearty consistency that made it perfect for making scones.

I think there may be something missing from the recipe, because there just isn't enough liquid to moisten all the dry ingredients. However, I mixed what I could, then added small amounts of milk until I could moisten the rest, then added the apples and proceeded as directed. Although it's still in the oven, I did taste the batter and have VERY high hopes for the bread! Plus all these reviews look good too!

delicious!!! better than the home and garden's recipe. I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil. I pealed then shredded my apples. I used vanilla powder. I also added 1/2 cup of crushed walnuts. Turns out sooo good! Even better the next day, after it's been sitting in the fridge.

The bread was crispy on the top and gooey in the middle.  It didn't rise.  It smelled great, which was a bummer when my boys came home eager to eat it.  I didn't add the nuts, but I'd be surprised if that would have made such a huge difference - who knows.....

I made this in an angel food pan and cooked it for 1 hour 5 minutes.  I subbed half whole wheat flour, and half brown sugar, and I forgot the vanilla (oops!).  I also added a few handfuls of raisins.  It was almost like cookie dough and I had a hard time mixing and was worried I was over mixing, but it turned out SO good.  It's bit on the sweet side, so I will cut down by a half cup next time.  I will definitely be making this again!

I had some extra apples and made this bread. It is wonderful. I followed another reviewers suggestions and to lower fat instead of oil, I used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of orange juice. They are so good. My kids love them. Also, it is a good way to get some fruit in them:)

I made this with one of my church groups.  This was very moist and rich.  The children in the group loved the bread - and we have some pretty picky eaters.

We ended up adding a couple tablespoons of milk to the recipe, because there wasn't enough liquid to get the flour fully incorporated.  We also substituted a mixture of pecans and macadamia nuts for the walnuts.  We got rave reviews on it from everyone who tried it, and I've had several people ask for the recipe.

Like some of the other reviews I too substituted oil for applesauce and added a little non fat milk to make it a bit more moist - I had to cook it longer because of tat but it was worth it - this is incredibly good!!!

This turned out amazing but I had do some modifications to the recipe. The reason why I gave it a 3 star is because it is beyond impossible to incorporate 3 cups of flower & dry ingredient into the listed wet ingredients. I ended up putting and additional 1/4cup of oil into the wet mix + one container (snack size) of apple sauce + one stick of melted butter just to be able to incorporate the mass into something I can work with. The final product before baking was a moist enough dough with well incorporated flour in it and like stated above it turned out amazing. Again, you need to modify this if you want it to come out successful.

Instead of using a bread pan I used a muffin pan. One heaping tablespoon per muffin.  I baked for about 28-30 minutes and they turned out perfect! The 32 serving recipe made 12 regular sized muffins and 6 large muffins (I Played around).  I love this recipe! I did add a bit more vanilla because I love vanilla.

Love this bread! Yes, the batter was more like dough. I had doubts about it after reading some of the reviews but stuck to the recipe as written. A nice crust on the top but moist inside. We spread a little butter on it while it was still warm. I'm going to make some as gifts. Thank you.

This bread is very good, but mine was a tad dry for my taste. I added applesauce instead of oil, maybe that's why. Next time I will add 1 C of applesauce rather than 1/2 C, and add an additional 1 C of apples. I didn't add the walnuts, as I didn't have any.I used half white and half brown sugar and 1 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 t of apple pie spice as suggested by other reviewers. The flavor was good, just needed more moisture. I also added a crunchy topping from another recipe. The topping was super! I used 1/4 C of low fat granola, 1/4 C chopped pecans, 1 T brown sugar, 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 T melted butter. I will update my review after making the changes. I have high hopes for this one! Hopefully the changes will bring it up to 5 stars.

I substituted dried cranberries for the nuts, but otherwise made exactly as written. I didn't think it would turn out because the batter was SO thick it barely came together, but it was perfect. I brought it to brunch at my in-laws and it was devoured before any of the other food was touched!

I, like a lot of people it seems, made the mistake of putting all of it in one bread pan. Also, I didn't have enough flour, so I used(roughly) 1 1/2 cup flour, 1 1/2 pancake mix. It tasted great, but only the top and edges were cooked! Next time I plan to: replace oil with applesauce, use all pancake mix, less sugar, a smidgen more salt. Also I think I'm gonna do a bit more cinnamon, and use a more tart apple. Maybe granny smith....

This is recipe is not to my liking. If I didn't know how to adjust recipes the batter would have been a waste. The recipe does not have enough liquid. Once I mixed everything together the batter was unsuseable UNTIL I ADDED extra liquid (I'm not even sure the measurements because I was adding by my eye) probably 1/4 c. of oil and 1 c. of applesauce. My bread came out fine with MY ADJUSTMENTS but never again will I use this recipe because it's not useable unless you add additional liquid! FAIL!!!!!!

This bread is GREAT-I increase oil to 2/3 cup , single serving size applesauce cup, and juice of one orange, 2/3 c golden raisins. Also for a crunchy crust with soft center bake at 400 for first half then finish at 375  till tester comes clean. Was in a hurry one day and I did that, and it browned and had a crunchy sweet edge-everyone justs gobbles it up!!

Delicious!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  I also use applesauce instead of oil.  I added the chopped nuts to the dry mix (tossing stir ins with flour keeps them from sinking to the bottom).  I also added 1 cup of Craisins.  Instead of chopping the apples, I grated them with my hand grater. I used about 3 cups of apples (I used MacIntosh).  I baked it in a bundt pan.  After I sprayed the pan with Pam, I sprinkled the inside of the pan with cinnamon sugar.  The only change I will make next time is to add more cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg.  My family really enjoyed the bread.

This was wonderful! Just like many other reviewers have already stated, the dough seemed to be a bit dry. I trusted the recipe and followed it as written - and it turned out fine while baking in the oven. Definitely a keeper - and a perfect recipe for fall!

So elighten me, all you guys who give this five stars.  The batter came out dry and crumbly because I am only adding a little oil and two eggs to three cups of flour and two cups of sugar.  This recipie didn't work. Had to add some milk and it was imperfect at best. I don't understand all the stars

Made this tonight and found a common thread with many other reviews. The recipe as written is too dry. Ends up looking like a crumble. So I added some extra liquid to help out in that area (milk, a bit more oil). It still was very dry anyway.  Also I should have realized that 2 cups sugar and 3 cups flour was going to result in something VERY sweet. Another review said "it's like eating candy". I would have to agree. Eating a bowlful of sugar is barely any sweeter.  Will never make this again and hindsight is 20/20 for reading reviews in more depth before spending time making "candy".

This recipe was so-so. The batter was very thick and the bread itself was heavy. The taste was good, nothing special from other loaf recipes though. I will probably keep searching for a better similar recipe.

Really good!  The only change I made was to add a touch more oil, and that was out of necessity because the mix was REALLY dry.  DO the toothpick test because it took longer in my oven than expected.  Sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top to give it a crust and it smelled and tasted heavenly.

Sometimes a recipe that does not require my KA mixer is all I can handle, and this one was great!  I made it in a 13x9 pan, and chopeed up 4 small spartan apples in to small peices (next time I will grate them in).  I also added 1/4 cup applesauce in addition to the oil, as other reviewers stated the end result was dry, and added small amounts of nutmeg and ground cloves.  Unfortunately, I left the bread in the oven for too long, next time Ithink 30-35 min should suffice, but the flavor was outstanding!

Great bread!! And VERY easy! After reading the reviews, I used 1 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of oil and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. Also, I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour, just to get some whole wheat nutrition. And, instead of 2 tsp of cinnamon, I used 1 tsp plus 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice- it added a nice flavor! I think next time I make this bread I'll add a streusal topping and see what happens!

I just made this in mini muffin form since I needed over 4 dozen treats to take to church.  I added about a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and ginger to spice them up a bit as well as a few tablespoons of milk since the batter was dry.  And I didn't add the nuts.  The recipe made 45 mini muffins.  I baked them in two batches for 20 mins each and they're perfect!  A little crunch on the outside and fluffy in the middle.  I used oil this time around but can't wait to try them with applesauce next time...when I can eat them all!

Great recipe. I made some changes - added one more apple and used just 1 cup of sugar. Also, I didn't put walnuts since some people have the allergic reaction to it. Still, the bread was delicious!

Very, Very Good! This was my first time ever making apple bread but it was wonderful. I also used applesauce, homemade applesauce, about a cup, instead of the oil. But it turned great. Will make again!!

Yum!!!  This bread is soooo good.  I have made some healthier alterations that I use when I am making this for my family and they work out very nicely. I sub all the oil for apple sauce.  *This does make the bread not rise quite as much, but the flavor is still great.*  I also cut down on the sugar by 1/4c. as well. Other users have suggested adding in 1/4 cup of Orange Juice, and that does work nicely. When I bake for my family, I try to keep it as healthy as possible, as a lot of us are trying to watch our weight. The original recipe is wonderful as well though and I use that one for special occasions.  (The only alteration I made when following the recipe is adding in the 1/4c. of orange juice.)

This bread is excellent.  Like others, I replaced 1/2 of the sugar with brown.  I think that really makes the bread.  It's like eating candy, and I love the chunks of apples, versus other recipes that call for shredding.  A definite keeper!!!

Thank goodness I'm an experienced baker/cook, or texture-wise I would have wondered what I did wrong.  Fortunately I did read some reviews before I started. The batter is extremely dry, to the extent that I couldn't stir it...so I did drizzle in approx 1/4 cup of oj at the end.  The result was a very tasty cake, that I will make again.  I also added about 2 tsp of vanilla...does 1/2 tsp really count? ha Definitely worth making, as long as your aware of the dryness of the batter.

Fabulous!!! I love the chunky texture of the apples and the flavor is really nice. Next time I may sprinkle the top with cinnamon and sugar before putting it in the oven just to make it pretty!

This is an amazing recipe - and a snap to make! I substituted applesauce for the oil (and added a bit extra) and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. I also replaced the eggs with egg substitute. The recipe made 24 muffins and they were absolutely perfect! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Delicious! Everyone I have made it for raves over it and asks for the recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and 1 c applesauce instead of oil. I've made this bread many times since finding the recipe and I enjoy the smell of it baking as much as the flavor when it's done.

I made this today and had some after it cooled down! It is super good! Of course after reading everyone elses reviews I did my own alterations. Instead of white sugar I did all brown sugar.I also did 1 1/2 tsp cin and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Instead of oil I did 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup ff sour cream and doubled the vanilla. Then as I mixed the wet into the dry ingrediants I added about 3-4 tbs of orange juice. I ended up baking it in my bunt pan. It was a heavy dough but I cooked it for an hour and 15 minutes. When it approached the hour mark I checked it with a wooden skewer every five minutes till it was done. Cooled on a wire rack and drizzled with a little confectioners sugar mixed with milk and yum! The sour cream makes it nice and moist.

I didn't have eggs so instead of the 2 eggs I added this vegan friendly concoction: 4 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp shortening, 1 tsp baking powder and 6 tbsp water. I also used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, and instead of walnuts added almonds. (in the recipe, and also sprinkled on top). Came out delicious! The  bread and apples are moist, and the almonds contribute a nice crunch. It was a breeze to make and will def be making it again in the future! (note: i also had to keep it in the oven for the full 45mins, it wasnt quite done after 40)

Excellent. I leave out the nuts but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. It seems dry when mixing it, but the result is moist thanks to the apples juicing up while baking.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I modified it a little bit.  I've read a lot of the reviews that complained about dryness, but I don't think that's fair at all - I've made this probably 4-6 times now and have never had any problems.  The modifications I made: 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar (packed down), 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg.  If you have a stand mixer I think that will help a lot - plus it's less dishes - I don't mix the sugars, oil, etc in a different bowl - just add them into the mixing bowl after you've mixed the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg.  I think that the natural juices from the apples make this really moist.  I don't grease the pans until I've added the apples at the end and let the mixer run while I'm doing that.

Awesome fall bread.  I did applesauce+apple juice instead of oil, and 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and it turned out great!  The dough definitely is more like cookie dough than bread dough, but not in a bad way. I did muffins and an 8x8 pan.  Fill the muffins almost to the top because the bread doesn't rise much, and bake for 20-22 minutes.

I made a healthier and vegan friendly version by using whole wheat flour, raw sugar reduced to 1.5 cups, 2T ground flaxseed + 6T water substituted for eggs, instead of nuts I used 1 cup of raisins that had been soaked a few minutes in boiling water, sea salt instead of ionized salt, and 1/2 cup of organic applesauce in place of the oil. The dough seemed a bit dry, so I added a splash of soy milk.  It was delicious!!

Really good overall  but  too sweet for me so I will decrease sugar( esp if following reviews with substituting applesauce since that may also sweeten it more). I got a nice moist cake by using 1/2 c applesauce and 1/3 c vegetable oil.

Yum, yum, yummy!  I rarely get a whole piece!  I found  with this batter, it comes out wonderfully when I pour it  in 1 brownie pan rather than a 2 loaf pans.  It seems to have more room to "grow".  At any rate,  I make it. They eat it. Everyone is happy with the yumminess!

Made this for a family brunch and everyone raved about it.  I always exchange applesauce for oil where possible, so I did do that.  And I also followed Carolyn's suggestion of using brown sugar for some of the sugar.  I also always leave out nuts because my family isn't fond of them.  We also have young children in our family and I do not want to limit someone's food selection if they are allergic to nuts.  Still giving it 5 starts even though I changed around some ingredients as I don't believe my changes deviated from the original recipe that much.  On a second batch of bread, I did add more applesauce (around 1 cup) and that was great also.

I thought it was very good! I followed the advice of some of the commentators and used applesauce in place of the oil and used whole wheat flour instead. Turned out really amazing and I know this is a recipe I'm going to use again and again

Made this with honey crisp that needed to be used, left out nuts but added raisins. Very tasty! Decided to try as muffins, even better as they all had more crispy edges.  Will be making this recipe often!

I made this recipe with a few additives, I added allspice, ginger, nutmeg, and fresh ground cardamon, 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of each(depending on taste).  I love the flavor of all those spices and they go very well with the apples. I used homemade apple-butter in lieu of the oil. I didn't have brown sugar like another member stated however I added 1/4 cup of molasses and it was awesome.

LOVE this!! For some reason, my dough ended up really dry, so I added water. Also, didn't use the nuts. And I had to bake it for over an hour, but it was worth waiting on! My house smelled wonderful. Of the two loaves I made two days ago, I have less than 1/4 of a loaf left. It's delicious!

This is an interesting recipe, because it lends itself so readily to variation. Like other reviewers, I found the batter to be slightly too stiff, so I halved the sugar (used only brown) and substituted real maple syrup for the other half, and I also added 3/4 c whole milk. 
In addition, because my family does not like nuts in bread, but I do, I used one cup white flour, one whole wheat, and one cup whole rolled oats, and this lent a nutty sort of flavor that satisfied me. 
A lovely recipe, thanks for sharing.

I changed some things about this recipe... I used three eggs, 1 cup applesauce, 1.5 cups sugar and 1 cup vegetable oil. The bread was had more substance and was a little less sweet. Its seemed too dry in its original state and  I was having trouble mixing all the ingredients. It came out delicious!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. Thank you Phyllis. I just started to make things from scratch and this came out perfect. Gave some to my neighbor. The fact that people can tweak this and keep this as a master recipe speaks volumes!!! Congratulations, it is a true winnner.

I canned apples last year and needed to use them up but I am not to big on apple pies.  I went to an apple class at my coop extension office and tasted apple bread.  I thought I would give it a try and found this recipe.  My family said this was the best tasting bread I have made yet.  I found a recipe for a fantastic tasting powdered sugar glaze.  I need to put that recipe in here.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This apple bread is absolutely delicious! I can't wait to share it with my friends & family. Like another reviewed I substituted apple sauce for the oil because I actually didn't have any veg oil on hand. I only used about 2.5 C flour.

Excellent, dense dessert or breakfast bread. My tweaks: Pureed and drained the apples first, added raisins and a touch more vanilla. Also baked for full 60 minutes.

I hate baking stuff like this because I don't bake.  It was excellent! I looked at all the reviews, decided to do it with a few exceptions.  I used no oil. I replaced that with 3 of the personal applesauce packs, about 9 oz worth. i added 2 oz of oj, and wished i has added maybe another oz. i did a really fine dice of the apples, 2 very large fuji apples was just over 2 cups. I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, and split between regular and brown. i put the whole thing in a buttered 4 x 9.5 inch nonstick loaf pan. 350 degrees 60 minutes+ I waitied until a toothpick was dry. it was nicely crusty and just releasing on the outside.

So good! But I did make a few changes. I used between 3/4 to 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil, 1 tsp. of  vanilla, and replaced the walnuts with fresh cranberries. I will be making this again!

This bread was pretty good. I think the ratio of flour to liquid is off. I wanted so badly to add extra oil or apple sauce but decided to follow the recipe exactly. My hunch proved to be correct unfortunately. I baked it for forty minutes as the recipe stated and it was quite dry. Almost every piece fell apart and crumbled everywhere. Still has a good flavor if you heat it up and add butter though!  If I make this again, I might add 1/2 cup applesauce in addition to the oil and see how that turns out. I really enjoyed "Grandma's fresh apple bread" from this site so I might just stick with that recipe next time.  This is an easy recpe and is very quick to throw together, thank you!

This is a great bread!  I substituted the oil with applesauce and even added a touch more to give the batter more moisture.  I baked them in mini muffin pans and it yielded 48 generous mini muffins.  Once cooled, I topped them with a vanilla-powdered sugar glaze.  Yummy and pretty healthy!

This is the best apple bread recipe I've made! Made a more calorie conscious version of it myself. In place of 2 C. of sugar, I used 1 C splenda and 1/2 C. Splenda brown sugar blend.  I replaced the oil with 3/4 C unsweetened applesauce ( the extra 1/4 C made it more moist.), and substituted 2 eggs with 4 egg whites.  Took it to work and my co-workers went nuts over it.  Now everyone wants to know when I'm making it again!

I consider myself a pretty good baker. I made the dough, it was so crumbly, wouldn't stick together at all. I kept reading the recipe over and over thinking I did something wrong, but I followed it to a tee! So, I baked half of it in a pan. Turned out horrible. So dry, crumbly, almost crunchy! so, with the remaining dough, I added a little applesauce, a touch of OJ, more spice (the first batch was so bland!) Finally, it was a dough consistency, I baked it- still awful! I am so sad I wasted so much time with this recipe.

I was extremely disappointed by this bread.  Even after adding some applesauce to add moisture and thin the super-thick dough a little, the bread was very dry.  The flavor is good, though a bit sweet, but it is impossible to focus on the flavor when it is so dry.

This apple bread was very yummy! I also used applesauce instead of oil and lower the sugar to about 1 cup (1/2 brn & 1/2 white). I also chopped up extra apples tossed them in sugar and cinnamon and placed them on top and it came out beautiful as if it should of been pictured in a magazine. My family loved it...even my picky little 3 year old. Thanks for the recipe!

this was really good. i've made this twice, the first time i omitted the oil and used about 1c. homemade applesauce (spiced slow cooker applesauce off this site) but didn't account for adjusting the sugar amount, also i didn't like the texture of the bread the first time, i felt it was due to omitting the oil completely, the bread was rubbery the first time around. so the second time i used 1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil and about 3/4 c of the same applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1c brown and about 1/4 c white. and i could tell the oil made a difference even when i was mixing it wasn't so thick. i also sugared my pans instead of using flour and made a topping of brown sugar, ground cloves, nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon and as far as the cooking time goes i'm not sure how anyone can make bread in 35 min but my loaves took 60-65 like all breads i've ever made!

Like others, I had to alter this recipe because it was too dry to stir.  I added 1 C brown sugar and  1 Cup white sugar.  I then had to add 1/2 cup of apple cider and 1/4 cup of orange juice.  I also kicked up the spices by adding 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 1.2 t cloves and 1 t of ginger in addition to the cinnamon.  The result was fantastic!  I gave this 3 stars for the basic recipe b/c I try to make the recipe as posted....

Awesome! I have tried this exactly as the recipe states and a healthier version (applesauce in place of oil, wheat flour, half white half brown sugar) and both were amazing. I will be making the healthier version from now on, it is so good even my white-bread-eating, sugar-loving husband loved it! :)

The result of this recipe, with a few minor changes, is great! I followed others suggestions and used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp apple pie spice, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and omitted the walnuts. I found that my dough was also too dry and all of the flour wasn't combining, so I added a few splashes of milk and one splash oil until it all combined nicely. I baked it in a bundt pan for about the same length of time. The end result is delicious and I haven't stopped snacking on it since!

The apple bread recipe apparently lacks an ingredient.  The mixture is too dry.  I added milk to get the consistency it should have.  Still the bread is coarse and the center is gooey.  Too many modifications will have to be made to make good bread.  Choose another recipe.

I use this recipe nearly every week in my home!! However, I do add a couple of things to make it a bit more yummy!! 1st, I mash up 2 bananas & add it to it, I use pecans instead of walnuts, a dash more vanilla, & I crumble brown sugar on top before putting it in the oven.  My boyfriend & other family absolutely love this!!

Smells fabulous, and the batter itself tastes great before being cooked. I have read a few reviews and discovered a lot of people had the same issues I had. It's way too thick. I only added a cup of sugar (partly because I didn't have enough), and in the end, I had to add at least a cup of applesauce because it was too dry and too thick. I think any major changes to the recipe means this recipe isn't that great. Everyone modifies a recipe for some reason, but some of the modifications were big. If I use this recipe again, I will probably change more of it as well, like, less flour, and more moisture. At least is smells great. Thanks for the recipe...I do enjoy trying new recipes.

I use 1 C white sugar and either 1 C brown sugar or 1/2 C brown sugar & 1/4 C honey, and add 1/2 tsp of ground clove. Also pretty good with pecans in lieu of walnuts! I love this recipe!

Chop sweet apple into small pieces. If adding nuts, mix as requested. Was flavorful and made it in a bundt pan but had to increase the time a little.

This bread was easy to make and smelled delicious.  The baking time is way off.  This is the second time today that I have tried it and it is still taking over an hour to cook and I had to cover it with foil because it was getting too dark on the outside but still goey on the inside.

I modified this recipe for Rosh Hashannah by adding 1/2 cup of milk when adding the wet ingredients, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg when mixing the dry. Then I added the apples, and 1 cup diced dates, 1 1/2 cups apple, and crushed pecansafter the wet and dry ingredients were mixed together. I also increased the baking time by 10 minutes.  Eat with honey and have a Happy, Healthy New Year:)

This bread was really good, but I did make the following changes:  added 1 cup of applesause, used 3 red delicious apples, added 1 tsp of vanilla and I used 1 cup dark brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar.  The bread didn't last long, however the next time I make it I will decrease the total amount of flour to 2 1/2 cups and use half wheat flour, and use applesauce instead of the oil.

I made mini-loaves of this apple bread for a party yesterday, and it was phenomenal!  I took the advice listed below and added a bit extra milk and oil to make the dough, since the listed ingredients resulted in something thick, crumbly, and not dough-consistency.  I sprinkled the loaves with  a blend of powdered sugar and cinnamon while they were cooling on the rack, and served them with fresh, homemade chai.  Absolutely marvelous.

Delicious!  I made these at the last minute for my son's class play event and I received several compliments on them!  I made the recipe almost exactly as written, the only changes I made were to leave out the walnuts and add a little extra chopped apples.  I cooked them in a Demarle mini muffin tray at 340 for about 20 minutes.  My oldest son can't stop eating them :)

We make this recipe all the time with great reviews! I use 2c whole wheat flour and 1c white as well as 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar. I also add dried cranberries and dried blueberries (maybe 2/3c total) and the berries make it extra wonderful! I also find the dough sometimes hard to mix, but as another reviewer suggested, I add a little extra oil and a splash of milk and it works just fine. We make mini muffins - 6 dozen total for the whole recipe and they are perfect for work functions. Decrease baking time to 15-17 min for mini muffins. Thanks for a great recipe Phyllis, it has become our family favorite.

This turned out too dry for me, perhaps I did something wrong. I also felt like there was too much sugar and oil so if I was to make this again I would use a lot less.

Fantastic! All on it own! Though, following other reviews I did do 1/2-1/2 white and brown sugar and i also added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger. To help combat the dryness some people reported I went ahead and added the apple to the sugar as I was chopping it, it helped to draw the moisture out a bit more. The bread and muffins that came out of this were AMAZING!!!! My roommates both gave it two thumbs way, way up!

Just pulled this out of the oven and already 1/2 of the first loaf is gone, has not even cooled yet.  Hubby loved the chunks of apple.  I did use applesauce instead of oil and since it was thick going into the loaf pan, I doubled the amount of applesauce.  It was perfect. Baking time was longer then expected but I was prepared for that from the other reviews.  This is a keeper.

I love this recipe and make it every time I have a chance!   Like some of the other commenters, I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. I don't know if it's just my oven, but the break often has to bake for closer to 60 minutes in order to be done all the way through.   It's well worth the wait, though - yum!

Good recipe, but a tad bit sweet.  If I were to make it again I would cut the amount of sugar by a 1/2 cup.

Wonderful!  I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg like some other users suggested and also subbed 1 cup of applesauce for the oil.  I missed the part of the instructions where it said to peel the apples, so left the skin on mine and it was fantastic.  Gave  it a bit of texture and also a fiber boost.  I had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe called for, but this bread was delish and my family and I loved it!  Will make again for sure!

Great recipe!  A delicious fall treat!  I used 1 cup of regular sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar as other reviewers suggested and omitted the nuts.  Everything else I kept the same.  The first time I made this bread I tested it with a toothpick at 30 minutes and it came out clean so I took it out of the oven.  Once I cut into it, it was not cooked all the way through.  I would cook for the full 40-45 minutes even if your toothpick comes out clean.

This is such a simple recipe. The best recipe ever tasted with apples. I shredded the apples instead of chopping them, and added  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar....still it came out the best apple bread anyone has tasted. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really quick, simple and very tasty.  I wasn't able to find any reviews where people commented on what kind of apples they used.  The only apples I had on hand were Granny Smith and I was worried that it would be too tart, but surprisingly it wasn't.  You could still taste a slight tartness of the apples but it went well with the overall sweetness of the bread.  Now I have another bread other than my traditional pumpkin bread to give out during the holiday season! This is a keeper.

This apple bread is quick, easy, and yummy! I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for the same amount of white sugar. The batter WAS very thick and sticky, but the cakes themselves baked up nice and moist. They also cooked all the way through without burning on top.  The first batch didn't last long so a second batch is in the oven as I write! :-)

I tried this recipe out for Christmas and it was a new FAVORITE! I went along w/the reviews of others and used ½ white & ½ brown sugar. I also changed the spices to 1 tsp. cinnamon + 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  Delicious!

I followed the recipie to the tee and after 50 minutes the middle was still raw.  Mixed it up and ended up using it as a apple cobbler type dish.  Sorry it was just to dry.

I followed the recipe as written, making no changes. The dough was too thick. The inside of the loaves never cooked and sunk in the middle with the outside being too dark. I am an experienced baker and I know that my oven temp. is correct.

While this wasn't the best bread I've ever had it was quite tasty. I had organic apples that I didn't want to go to waste so I actually used and extra apple. This bread is really easy to make. I sustituted 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour for half of the flour, unsweetened applesauce for the oil and 1 c of brown sugar for 1 of the cups of white. I also added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger and some pumpkin pie spice. I also doubled the vanilla. I had no problems with the  dough being too thick but a splash of OJ will solve the problem. Great recipe. Will keep making as the taste testers loved it.

this is a great recipe; it was way too dry when I mixed it up; so I added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesause. Then I added about another 1/2 c of apples. Turned out perfect!

I've made this 4 times in the past week! I LOVE IT! I did have to add just enough water when adding the flour to the apple mixture to mix everything together. Other than that modification, the recipe is perfect!

This was really good.  I never made apple bread before.  I used macantosh apples (4 of them).  I did take another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2 cup apple sauce (which I had just finished making in the crock pot), instead of oil.  I made 6 mini loaves and one small loaf.  My whole family loved it!  I will definately make it again.

So delicious!!  Because I was short on white sugar, I used 1-1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I also left out the walnuts.  I kept everything else the same and it was so yummy and moist.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and cut the sugar to 1.5 cups.  I added grated orange zest to give a little extra flavor.  It turned out great.

Great recipe! I modified it a bit to fit my own tastes. Substituted 75% of the oil with apple butter. Apple sauce would work too. Since the apple butter already has sugar and spices, I left out the additional cinnamon and reduced the sugar. Also used crushed pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Loaf came out perfectly, and I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy to make.  I would use more apples myself, but I love apples.  I too made one loaf and the rest in muffin tins.  Chewy with a crunchy top.  Will make again.

This bread was delicious!  I made the recipe this morning and there is only one slice left.  I did add 1/2 cup of applesauce to the batter in addition to the oil and I omitted the nuts (family does not like them).  I also baked the loaves in a 9x5 pan for only 40 minutes instead of the 8x4 pan called for in the recipe. It was outstanding--definitely will make again!

Pretty good bread.  It was an excuse for me to use the slicing disk on the food processor- it made thin apple pieces layered throughout.  Instead of putting the walnuts in the bread I made a cinnamon, sugar, walnut crumb topping with a tablespoon of melted butter.  I also reduced the sugar in the bread and substituted applesauce for oil.  It reminds me of an apple cake my mother used to make.  My husband didn’t care for it and thought it was just okay, not great, though he liked the crumb topping I added.

Works great with applesauce instead of oil.  I made a half batch (one pan) and you need about one apple to do that.

I didn't read the reviews, and thought I'd missed something when the batter came out so dry! The other reviewers were right--the dry batter won't negatively affect the cake itself, although I did add a little apple sauce to moisten it up a bit. I didn't LOVE the taste of the cake, although I can't put my finger on what I would change. My partner did enjoy it though.

Excellent! I followed the recipe, but added a brown sugar and cinnamon crumb topping, and it was phenomenal. My husband is a very picky eater, but his review was, "It is really, really, really, really good."

This is a great recipe. The bread is easy to make and everyone loved the taste.  The only minor baking issue I had was that the dough was quite dense.  I ended up adding 1/4 cup of water to give it some moisture.  I will definitely make this again

really thought this was a bread, but when i hade made it it tasted just as our "sockerkaka" here in sweden but whit apple and cinamon. socker=sugar and kaka=cookie (big baked bread like this is called kaka in sweden)

it was sure a verry nice recipe  whit cinamon, apples and valnut. and  i will for sure make it many more times. the recipe is perfect

Fantastic, can't mess this one up! Very moist dense apple bread with a crispy crust. I followed the recipe exactly except i used half whole wheat flour. This one is a keeper:)

Loved this bread.  I did the 1 3/4 cups of sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 teas. of nutmeg.  The batter was kinda stiff so at the end i added 1/2 Carmel ice cream topping. WOW!!!  It is moist and taste just like apple pie.  Best bread I have ever made to date.

I've made this twice, once following the instructions and the second with my own additions.  I thought it was a little bland so I used apples that were coated in cinnamon/sugar, 1/4c oil and 1/4c cinnamon applesauce, and a splash of cider because my batter was super thick.  I also used 1/2c whole wheat flour, 1c bread flour, and 1 1/2c AP flour and topped with with about 1/16c cinnamon/sugar mixture per loaf.  Turned out to be uch more of a sweet bread- can't get my co-workers out of it!

I really like this recipe and have made this several times.  I don't use the walnuts and add about half a cup of water to the dough because it is so dry.

This was excellent.  I added 2 cups of raisins as well as the apples and it was even better.  Substituted veg. oil for the applesauce and OJ like someone suggested and it still tasted great.  Thanks for posting!

No stars. something was missing in the recipe because it was all floury when I mixed together. Looking at other recipes, I found this one to be lacking one egg and 1/2 cup more oil. I added those other ingredients.

I would give this recipe zero stars but the rating scale forces me to choose at least one. Maybe it was written wrong but it wa a crumbly mixture. I reread the recipe 5 times before I decided to trust it and put it in the oven. Turned out exactly the way I put it in the oven, dry and crumbly.  I would suggest adding more wet ingredients before trusting this recipe.

I didn't find the batter to be thick, dry or difficult to work with. I used my stand mixer and it blended beautifully. I used  2 cups of apples which had been soaking in a batch of sangria, so perhaps the added moisture helped prevent some of the problems other users have reported. It was great!

I have it in the oven now!  Made a few changes based on others reviews. I supplimented applesauce for vegetable oil and added nutmeg. Also, I shredded my apples (3) and my batter was FAR from dry!!  (and tasted awsome). Hopefully it comes out alright. Thank you for the recipe ;-)
Ok, so it just came out and it's really good. Def gonna share the recipe

Awesome bread! My hubby said it is the best bread he's ever had. Only changes I made were to add some applesauce as other reviewers had said, and to add a streusel topping.  Also had to bake breads about 10 mins. longer.

I won't be making this one again.  3 stars for taste only.  Tasted good, but like another reviewer said the batter was way too dry and crumbly.  I split into two loaf pans like the recipe states, and they barely rose halfway up the pan.  The loaves of bread were delicious it just wasn't anything like the picture!

Still in the oven after three hours...but I did not divide the recipe and put it all in one large loaf pan so it's totally my bad! The top and bottom was done, the middle still raw, but the parts done tasted pretty good. Also, I used 1/2 buck wheat to boost the protein. Perhaps another reason why it's taking so long.

2 cups of sugar seemed way too much for me, so I only put 1 and a half. I hope the center cooks thru soon!

I use 1/2 cup of walnut oil in place of the walnuts. I blend 4 apples in the mix to make it a bit more liquid and slice up 2.
It's a success everytime.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great basic recipe that you can easily modify.  To date I have not added nuts to it.  But I have added dried cranberries (YUMMY!)  I make this in my kitchenaid mixer.  I follow directions exactly but I do add milk, slowly, at the end.  It moistens up fast.  I can't imagine that this cooks well without milk!  I like to make the mix more like a gooey muffin mix texture, it comes out SOOO moist.   You'll love this recipe!  Enjoy

I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and used whole wheat flour and my batter was SUPER dry.  I ended up adding about a 1/2 cup of apple juice and a 1/2 cup apple sauce and it turned out delicious.

Very good recipe. I made half of it (twice). Modifications: I used half white sugar, and half packed brown sugar. Added 1/4 tsp more of cinnamon. Used the same 2 cups of apples. Left the apples in the oil/egg/vanilla mixture for a while and that made the apples release some juice to make this bread moist. Since I have a dark metal pan, I had to bake it at 325° (the second time) for 1 hour. We love it!

Once I mixed everything together it was so dry I could not add to pans. I had to add extra oil, egg and even some water to get it anywhere close to a batter like consistancy. It still came out dry tasting. If I had applesause to add it may have been better.

Great recipe! It definitely was a bit of work chopping all the apples and working everything together. The dough is a bit tough to work with because it is a bit dry. I followed the recipe exactly as it is and was a little scared because it did not look like it was enough for the two bread pans, but they turned out so nicely! Considering the amount of sugar, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it might be. People enjoyed it on Thanksgiving as another option for dessert. I will definitely do this again!

This bread was so moist and delicious! I did as some other reviewers suggested and substituted apple sauce for the oil plus a little more, used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup of white sugar and one half cup brown sugar, and added a little orange juice. Excellent!

Well I followed the recipe and thought that after adding the liquid to the flour it looked very very dry.       I baked it anyways thinking it would not be very good. I let it cool and cut a peice and to my surprise ...IT TASTED GREAT!! Go's to show you don't judge a bread by it's look.....a

followed the recipe exactly - horrible, dry, did not rise, was sitting on the counter for days, nobody wanted it. Make sure you read the reviews and follow them, not the recipe!

Not entirely sure what may have gone wrong. I followed the recipe to the letter and, like a few others, ended up with a dry crumbly (all be it well seasoned) dish. Not a total loss though, the crumbly bits go REALLY WELL on top of vanilla ice cream!

Maybe it's because I live in Colorado and it's so dry here, but this bread was *so* dry.  The dough was about the thickness of sugar cookie dough, and I felt that couldn't be how it was supposed to be.  I added a little more oil, but the bread still came out very hard.  This is the second apple bread recipe I've tried, as the first recipe I tried also came out as hard as a rock.  Perhaps this recipe works well in other climates, but I would advise looking for a different recipe if you live somewhere dry!

I just tried this recipe for the first time, and I plan on making it again. My substitutions probably made it less tasty -but overall it was still really good.  I substituted whole wheat flour for 2 of the cups required, and left out the vegetable oil (used apple butter instead). I don't recommend these changes -but I can't wait to try again and actually FOLLOW the recipe!

I loved the recipe given.  But I changed it a bit.  I added about a cup of chocolate chips.  Instead of 1/2 tsp of vanilla, I added a whole tsp, I substituted the walnuts with pecans and then I added a couple Tbl of orange juice.  It turned out to be very moist.  Love it!

Awesome! Loved this bread, very easy to make. I did add a little more oil to the mixture~ seemed a little dry while mixing. Next time I may try it with the applesauce instead of oil! But it was delicious!!! :)

I've had better.  But definitely too dry to begin with.  Had to add milk to mix in all the flour.

I agree with the other reviewers who said the liquid/dry ration is OFF. I followed the directions and there was so little liquid all of the flour would not mix in. I'm a very experienced baker so I knew the batter did not look right for a quick bread. I added 2/3 cup milk, which did improve the consistency, but the flavor was bland at best. I don't understand why this recipe has so many 5 star reviews.

I made this without the baking powder, only the baking soda because I was out.  Still turned out great.   I brought it to work and everyone loved it.   I'll try it with the baking soda next time and see.  Can't imagine it being better.  It was delish.

It was very tasty!  I used no sugar added apple sauce instead of oil and 1 c regular sugar/1 c brown sugar, 1.5 c reg flour/1.5 c whole wheat flour.  No nuts.  The batter was very thick and the bread came out a little more dense than I prefer, so next time I'll add more applesauce.

Great Recipie. I substituted the flour, sugar and oil with brown rice flour, splenda and apple sauce. The batter was very dry so I added about a 1/2 a cup of milk . They taste great

Ok so this was deliciously different. We ate the entire first loaf before it even cooled down. Did I mention there were only three of us? I made the recipe as written except adding 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the end, this helps to smooth things out. I do it with most of my quick breads. My family has already decided that it shall have a place on the munchies’ table at Thanksgiving. Next time I make this I will take others advice using part white sugar and part brown. I will also include apple sauce, not to replace the oil, just in addition to it. Thanks for a great recipe and a new tradition Phyllis!

This came out really tasty! I followed the changes of other reviewers (half & half white/brown sugar, milk) and doubled the apples (4 cu). I also added vanilla, homemade apple butter (about 1/4 cu) and omitted the oil. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe but substituted whole wheat flour, and used 1 C applesauce and 1/4 C OJ for the oil.  I also followed the substitution listed above, 1 C white and 1 C brown sugar. It's a nice, dense, moist apple bread!  Very tasty, and my husband loves it.

Amazing! I just finished baking 4 loaves. I substituted the oil for 1 cup of applesauce and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. It's very heavy and very sweet. My family is in love! Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Love this recipe. Next time I'll omit a little sugar. I found it to be a bit too sweet. Could just be the apples were already sweet enough.

OMG!!!  Soooo good.  Next time, I will make it with applesauce to decrease calories, and roast the pecans for a little extra flavor (I used them in place of walnuts because I prefer them).  This has Christmas present written all over it!!!

Um...this was good bread. I used pecans as I didn't have walnuts. For the first loaf I did precisely as the recipe said and it baked up quite nicely. The second loaf I made a brown sugar and cinnamon crumble topping to make it more like a dessert. This is a good recipe to have children help. The only complaint I have is more that I am not a huge fan of the texture, but a little bit of butter slathered on the a slice made up for it. It made the house smell fantastic. It really got me amped up for Fall.

Really super delicious!! As others have done, I substituted the oil for equal part unsweetened applesauce. The batter was quite dry but the apples released alot of moisture during baking the the loaf turned out absolutely amazing!! My Mom, who 'hates' apple baking, loved it so much she had thirds :)

Sorry i did make some changes based on other reviews. I scaled it down to 1 loaf. I shredded the apples, covered them in sugar and cinnamon.  (i used brown sugar and white, i use only 2/3 cup also) I let that mixture sit till all the apple juices started coming out. I used apple sauce for the oil. The bread didn't rise too much and the batter was still thick, but it baked up in 39 minutes and had a nice flavor and texture. My 2 and 6 year old enjoyed it as well.

I loved this recipe.  I changed the oil to butter, because butter has such better flavor, and I added 1 tablespoon of Wheat Gluten to make it a bit fuller (I live at 1 mile high).  I used my Granny Smith apples off my tree.  My kids couldn't keep off it all weekend.

Very good, but I will add more apples and more cinnamon next time and bake in muffin pan.  Substituting brown sugar for white may also make it tastier.

although the bread was moist, the sides started to burn before the inside was completely cooked through also, the "toothpick" method of checking when breads are done doesnt work here. the toothpick may come out clean but it will still be raw in the center so make sure u follow the correct cooking times. i used mini loaf pans and made a strusel topping SOOOO CUTE

This was pretty good, but a little too dense for me. I think I should have cut the apple squares a little bit bigger so it would have been airier. I did one loaf at 50 minutes (sprinkled regular sugar on top) and then 8 muffins at 25 minutes.

Wow!  This bread was easy and was soooo tasty!  I may use a little more apple next time (my prefeence) and did use half brown sugar/half white sugar as others had suggested.  Crust came out almost like a streusal!

Perhaps it is because I messed up the recipe, but this apple crumbled pretty easily after I took it out of the oven 55 minutes later.  I tend to like moister dessert breads, so I substituted mayo for the eggs.  The batter was very dry (even without walnuts!), and I had to mush the apples into the batter to get enough moisture into the recipe.  I suggest shredding the apples to make it easier to mix.  Otherwise, the taste was excellent!

awesome recipe! the batter is very stiff, but if you let the chopped apples sit in the sugar for a few hours you'll have just enough liquid to mix in the flour. like others i experimented with using applesauce instead of oil & a brown sugar/white sugar mix. this recipe works well with both alterations. i also added 1/2tsp of nutmeg for a little extra flavor.

This bread is delicious, especially a day or so after baking it.  The flavors really come together and the apple gets a bit mushy, so it's like eating an apple pie in bread form!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and it came out beautifully.

Good bread.  I used applesauce in place of the oil (adding about a third cup more than the recipe called for because the batter was a little dry) and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I found that it needed to be baked about 10 minutes longer than stated in the recipe.

Very good recipe.  It's not real sweet but I like that about it.  I used 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups sugar.  I only had granny smith apples also.  Wonderful and I will make it again.  Thanks!!!!

Wished that I had read reviews first. I wasted a whole lot of stuff. It was dense and not very pretty. Although my husband did say that it was tasty. I will read reviews before I try another recipe.

This took way longer than 40 minutes to bake. Because the batter is so thick, the usual toothpick test does't work.  I tested this way after 45 mins and it came out clean so I took the breads out of the oven.  As they cooled they collapsed in the middle which was totally uncooked.  The ends tasted good so I tried the recipe again baking for about an hour and it was excellent.

Just finnished baking it and tastes great. I did use other reviews suggestions and used half the flour as whole wheat, half the sugar as brown sugar, and used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the oil. Made 1 large loaf and 2 mini loafs. For the dumbies like me out there only fill loaf pans about 1 third full they rise a lot.

Oh my gosh. I almost never get around to writing reviews, even for great recipes. But this is AMAZING. Most of the quick bread recipes I've found turn out rather dense and largely flavorless, but not this one. Wonderful!!!

Just a little too sweet for my taste, but well received by those I served it to.  I used about 3 1/2 cups apples because I wanted it to be very full of fruit - turned out wonderfully apple-y!

This is so good!  The only changes I made were replacing the oil with 1 cup of applesauce and adding 1/2 tsp of  nutmeg.  The batter was not dry at all and the apple pieces didn't sink to the bottom.  I baked them in a muffin tin for 25 minutes.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delish!!!  I did make a few changes though.  I used only 1 cup sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), I subbed applesauce for the veg oil, used pecans rather then walnuts (it's the only nuts I had), and I sprinkled in a little nutmeg as well.  Came out apple-y and sweet but not too sweet.  I'm making more tonight...the whole family loved it!

We are really enjoying this recipe.  The first time I made it as written and it was great. Now I regularly use half brown sugar and shred the apples. I also add whatever my whim suggests as I put the ingredients in... the last time I made this bread I added a couple tablespoons of flax seed, about a half cup of oats, and some applesauce.  I also play with the flour proportions leaning towards as much whole wheat as I can get away with.  This is a pretty flexible and forgiving recipe as the bread or muffins made using it as a base have always turned out delicious.

the bread didn't raise as much as i expected. so i'll try to add more baking soda & powder next time. i used 3/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar, it turned out well. i added some OJ and it is at the right amount of moisture. I also substituted oil with applesauce. i shredded the apples, but id recommend to chop it if you want to feel the exsistance of apples.

This is the first time I tried this recipe.  I did a couple of changes like other viewers suggested: 1 1/2 tsp cinninam, 1 cup of apple sauce, 1 cup of sugar (3/4 brown and the rest is white) and 1/4 cup of orange juice.  With the origianl recipe, 32 servings, I made 19 muffins.  They turn out to be very moist.  I will make apple bread instead of muffins next time. This is definatley a keeper for me.

I just tried this recipe and was not really satisfied.  The batter seemed like a cookie batter...it was all crumbly and did not bake well.  It never rose either.  ???  I even added more cinnamon and the flavor was not the greatest either. :( ~Kristy...a 13-year-old baker

Excellent!  Was a little concerned about the batter (almost gritty and a little thicker than i'd expected), but turned out great.  Used 1 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup OJ and skipped the oil and walnuts--it's excellent!

I don't know if I did something wrong...?  I went over the recipe again and again (with some of the suggested modifications like applesauce instead of oil, half white half brown sugar) and I couldn't place what happened, but my end result was very dry.  It has massive potential, so I'll try it again.  Hopefully next time it'll work out.

This was a good recipe however I did struggle because the dough was dry. I did manage to get a consistency good enough to pour into the tin. I also added walnuts and found a dutch apple bread recipe (from this site)that had a great toppng. My husband took it to work and they all loved it.

Disappointing to say the least. I followed the recipe exactly as posted. The batter was very flavorful. However after baking for 45 minutes I removed what appeared to be a perfect loaf of apple bread. (Note: I had inserted a metal pick that came out clean) After cooling the center sank and the entire center area from each side was mush & the edges golden and firm. Maybe it would work better as a muffin recipe?  I used a glass loaf pan in a gas oven, and would not suggest this combination for a successful attempt. Maybe it is the Indian not the arrow, as others seem to rave about this recipe.

My husband took a loaf of this on a road trip and he loved it.  I had froze a loaf and it seemed to freeze quite well.  Pretty good.  I can't wait to make it again using applesauce & oj like another person on here:)

I made this recipe with no alterations.  The dough was extremely thick.   The inside never cooked, while the outside got hard and crunchy.  We're using them for doorstops.  I don't think it's my oven, as other things are baking just fine.  Maybe I missed something here - but, I did not have a good experience with this recipe!

Yum!  Used others' suggestion and substituted applesauce for the oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar for part of the white sugar.  Made 4 mini loaves and 4 Texas muffins (baked 20 minutes).  Going to make another batch just in the Texas muffin tins.

Very dense bread, which also turned out on the dry side. I didn't read until the end that the recipe is for 2 breads, and I'd already mixed the ingredients together. My fault for not reading it thoroughly before baking, but usually it's safe to assume a bread recipe makes one loaf. I give it one star because I really only needed one loaf, and when it didn't turn out the way I expected it felt like I'd wasted food. Now I have 2 not so great breads rather than one.

This bread was really easy and pretty good.  It is very sweet though, more of a cake bread and I was going for more of a breafast bread.  Next time I will add half the sugar.  I also used half flour and half bran - made it a bit heavier but still good and increased the fiber by a lot!

This was one of the best breads that we have ever had! It was very easy to make for me and my 3 yr old! It was a huge hit with the whole family! I accidentally added twice the apples and it was moist and delicious!

Excellent apple bread!  I took the advice of other reviews and used apple sauce rather than the oil.  My bread turned out perfect and tastes so good.  This will definitely be a new favorite in our household.

I found this bread dry. I added some milk to the dough as it was too dry to mix in the flour but the outcome was still a little too dry. Although the flavor was good.

I halved the recipe for one loaf.  I took others suggestions and cut back on oil, added applesauce and a bit of nutmeg. Great flavor but not as moist as I expected although it is good toasted. I would give this recipe another shot without altering to see how it comes out.

This recipe was great, but as stated by others, I had to make a few modifications.  I added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce to make it more moist.  I also changed the cinnamon from 2 teaspoons to 1, and added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of allspice.  
I choose not to add the nuts.  
It is a great foundation recipe that you can easily customize to your own personal taste.  Thanks!!!

I felt that this bread was WAY too sweet, and not very apple-y.  If I make it again, I'll use less sugar and more apples.

I don't know if it's because I live at a high altitude or what, but this turned out horrible. Tasted like cardboard...which is a huge bummer because my husband has been begging for apple bread! Maybe I'll try it again and see if turns out any different.

Awesome Bread!  Love it..  definitely a keeper.  I took the other suggestions though and used applesauce instead of oil and I used 1 red and 1 green apple to balance flavor, I didn't use any nuts though as we don't like nuts in bread.  I also used a sugar cinnamon topping.  Wonderful!  Hubby is sure to love these!  This will become a staple in my baking that's for sure!  Oh I also greased and then sugared my pan.. just something different.

This was pretty good. I added nutmeg and made a crumb topping per other reviewers. This is probably something I'll make when I have an abundance of apples from our trees in the fall.

Well, this bread tastes really great. I used pecans instead of walnuts, due to an allergy, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I am a bit disappointed that it didn't rise more. Perhaps it would have worked if I made one loaf instead of two or made muffins instead.

Great bread, I made two changes.  Substituted applesauce for oil and added nutmeg.  I bake them in mini bread pans.  Kids love it.

AMAZING!! I made minor changes based on reviews.  I decreased sugar 1/4 cup and changed a little of it brown, and increased cinn. a bit. Yes, it was thick, but it was fabulous!  Next time I will let the apples sit in the wet ingredients for a little while to juice up. Oh, and once I combined wet and dry, I had to walk away for 10 minutes or so and it seemed like the batter was a little more moist just from sitting.  I have tried buttering and sugaring the pans and it was good but not necessary.  I also sugar the top slightly....wonderful.  I am already planning another batch and I think I will add a bit of water to the wet ingred. this time, most of my quick-bread recipes have water.  The final product is extremely moist without adding water but I will try it just to help batter thickness.  It took a lot longer to bake too.  Hmmm, what else, it makes the house smell amazing, everyone who has tried this loves it, it's a nice change from banana bread and pumpkin bread!

It was great, but I had to add water to the mixture b/c it came out way too thick.

It is really a BREAD (in a good way ;-).  It is quite dense and flavorful.  As another reviewer mentioned, the batter is kind of stiff but the bread turns out delicious and moist.  I did not have walnuts, so I added sliced almonds and it turned out OK.  I also halved the recipe and baked it in 9x5 dish for 40 min.  It did not raise much but the crust was nice and crispy.  Good recipe, thanks………….

This was very good.  I took it to a Fall dinner get-together at a friends and everyone loved it.  It is best warm!!!  I did make two small adjustments.  I left out the nuts and I was 1/2 cup short on white sugar so I used a little brown sugar.  Will be a Fall favorite at my house!!!
