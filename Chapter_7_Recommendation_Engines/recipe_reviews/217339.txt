This was very good.  I made as is, but would cut back on the salt next time as I am a low sodium eater.  Next time I make this I would like to try putting the greased cookie sheet in the oven for a few minutes to get it hot and the bottom more crispy.  Yummy!

LOVE THIS. We went to the store to find what fish looked best that day. It was walleye (which I had never made before). When I came back home with my visiting friend I found this recipe and made it while he did some chores for me. I used panko breadcrumbs. It was great! Thanks for making me look like a pro on the spot!

GREAT RECIPE! I wanted to find a "baked" recipe for walleye but with breading and a "fried" taste. This was really good.  I had tripled the amount of Walleye (3 lbs. of 2 large filets). I cut each filet into 6 filets which totaled 12.  I used the same amount of eggs and water (2 eggs & 1 tbs. of water) which was plenty!  I doubled the bread crumbs (Panko is all I use), instant mashed potatoes, parmesan cheese (I used Parmesan & Romano) and the same amount of seasoned salt (1 tsp.) which was plenty for us. I whipped the eggs and water in a bowl, mixed all the dry ingredients in a larger bowl, dipped fish in egg/water mixture then dipped in bread crumb mixture.  Realized I still had plenty of egg & bread crumb mixture left so I dipped the coated fish filets again in egg then bread crumb mixture until gone. I was able to double coat 2/3 of my filets. Placed filets on a prepared (Pam sprayed) pizza pan with holes, melted approx. 2 tbs. of butter and added a handful of fresh parsley and drizzled over the top of each filet (my preference).  Baked in 450 degree pre-heated oven for 20 minutes (a little underdone which we like) OMG DELISH! My family ages 8 to 54 loved this recipe.  The filets that were not "double coated" were really good, but the filets that were "double coated" were GREAT! I always refrigerate breaded fish at least 1/2 hour before baking/frying. I served with tossed salad, asparagus, and teriyaki rice. What a GREAT MEAL!~THANK YOU so much for this recipe!!  WE LOVED

Very good.  I've eaten walleye hundreds of times and almost always fried because I couldn't find a good way to bake them.  This is great.  I subbed panko for the instant mashed potato flakes.  Also, I like to bake these on a pizza pan with holes in the bottom, or some sort of tight mesh rack so that the bottoms of the filets don't get soggy, and the whole piece stays firm.

I was out of instant mashed potatoes so I had to improvise for some flavor. I added a little bit of dill, paprika and garlic salt to the breading and put a little bit of lemon juice on each filet before baking. They turned out great. Hope to try the genuine recipe next time. I'll be sure to check my cupboard BEFORE thawing out the walleye!

My husband is a bit of a picky eater and he doesn't usually rate my cooking as exceptional but I made this for the first time tonight and he LOVED it! I didn't modify anything and I made my own bread crumbs out of 1 slice of wheat bread. It looked and tasted gourmet! I will definitely use this recipe again when I cook up the rest of the walleye we caught in Minnesota last year.

I thought it tasted more like a walleye casserole. I just didn't think the flavor meshed and I was very disappointed. My husband was also not impressed.

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious....healthier too.  My husband didn't even realize until after dinner that we didn't have tartar sauce with the fish--it was that good :)

i used smaller individual pieces of walleye (cause i really like breading!) i baked it for 20 min in an un-greased casserole dish rather than a baking sheet. it was perfect!

This is a GREAT  recipe. Try it and you will never fry fish again or prepare it any other way. I add a package of dry onion soup mix to the ingredients. I cook on a sprayed non-stick pizza pan with holes in it. The pan is available from Wal Mart and is inexpensive and delivers a crispy fillet on both sides that doesn't stick to the pan.  I might add that I cut the fillets into three pieces and depending on how thick they are I cook at 450 for 16-18 minutes and then turn the oven to "broil" for 1-2 minutes to brown the fish a little bit.   Is an easy, clean, no fuss way to prepare not only walleye but also crappie, pike, tilapia, flounder, grouper, and even salmon.

Was good but will use others suggestions of baking on pan with holes and using Panko for bread crumbs next time in hopes of a crisper coating,

Crispy, flavorful and easy. I used freshly caught Walleye today for this treat. I love that it is this crispy and not fried. Mine cooked in about 15 minutes.

Good recipe, I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  My teenager and 7 year old liked it, and I didn't have to deep fry it so my house didn't smell like oil, so I liked it!  Even my husband who prefers his fish fried liked this recipe.  I think I will use this again!

I evidently did something wrong as my fillets did not come out crispy whatsoever.  The flavor was still good though.

I have been looking for a good baked fish recipe and this was it. I will definitely make again! I used blended up all bran cereal instead of bread crumbs and omitted the mashed potato flakes and seasoned salt. Baked it  for about 16 minutes! It was perfect!

The flavor on this was amazing!  I used some garlic and parmesan flavored potato flakes and my family loved it!  My husband told me 4 times how awesome supper was.  The bottom of mine were really soggy though. I'm not sure if there is something I can do different next time so that the fish is crispy on the top and bottom?

I added a sauce to add a bit of zing: Dijon mustard, lemon juice and mayonnaise. Didn’t measure but I’d say 2T of mustard and mayo and just enough lemon juice to thin it out. Mix together and drizzle over fish.

My bread crumbs expired so my husband and I used beer batter mix in it’s place. When you’re cooking for 2 or 3 and you are watching your waistline this recipe is simple and easy. Our 22 year old son stopped by while we were eating and stated it was the”best walleye he ever had”. It was incredibly delicious and I will be making it like this over deep fried from now on!

This was just nothing short of excellent! my tweaks and method-I had a good amount of fish, covered 1 large pizza pan. I used 1/3 C of Panko crumbs, then close to another 1/3 C. of some cracker and some regular bread crumbs, mixed w a blend of seasoning. (garlic salt, dill, cajun blend w lemon pepper) 3 eggs w 2 T water.  had more than enough of both, in fact, I double dipped and breaded half the batch. I omitted Parmesan and potato flakes, as didn't want to mask taste of great fish. baked on Pam sprayed pizza pan w a foil wrapped pizza pan on rack below to catch mess, at 450 for 15 min. most filets were not thick at all. fish was opaque. Highly recommend!

This is my go to “fried fish”.  I used panto as I was out of bread crumbs.  I like adding Old Bay to the dry mix.

Hit the spot for walleye, and for other white fish   I didn’t change anything the first time around. The next time (which is tonight) I’m going to element the mashed potatoes. I’ll use additional bread crumbs, toasted.

Used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and do not bake any longer than the time in recipe stated in recipe even if crust is not as brown as you would like it.  Tasted great and will do again.

I would recommend a few things to an otherwise very easy and useful recipe. Both of my suggestion will make the breading on the fish more crisp.

1. Put foil on cookie sheet and spray or grease. Then put into oven while preheating (will smoke) to get the pan nice and hot. This helped make the bottom of the fish crispy.

2. Sprinkle left over breading on top of fish to get a better crust in top. Then broil the fish on low for a minute or so to brown the top. I did this just before the fish was all the way done.

Very good, love the crispness and no oil.
I had varying thicknesses of fish.  Really watch your time, some were perfect and some should have been taken out earlier even though I cut down cooking time to 15 minutes.

love this recipe, even without the potato flakes (I never remember to buy them!). Used fresh caught walleye, added a little italian seasoning from Penzy's and cooked 25 minutes until the top was a little crispy. My hubby does broil at the end for 2 minutes when he makes it as well. Great alternative to frying to keep it on the healthier side for week nights!

I used 1/4 cup each of plain bread crumbs, panko bread crumbs and still used 1/3 potato flakes and parmesan. Used 1 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning. It tasted great!

This made a nice crust for the walleye.  I followed the directions with the exception of using kosher salt in place of seasoned salt.  Don't normally eat instant mashed potatoes so the one-serving pouch kind worked good for me to use in this recipe.  Had to add several minutes cook time to make sure the fish was done and also brown the top.  My fish had skin on one side so cooked that down and didn't worry about both sides getting crispy since I don't like to eat the skin anyway and take it off after it's cooked.  I will be buying walleye more often!

I will use this quick, easy and flavor packed recipe again. I added a couple tablespoons of ranch dressing to the egg mixture and also left out the potato flakes.  I have  made this twice now once I used it on walleye and the second time I used it on homemade chicken fingers.

I love this recipe. It's hard to truly get crispy fish without frying, but this is the next best thing! I like to use the flavored instant potatoes instead of plain. I would recommend not adding the additional seasonings - particularly salt - if you use the flavored potatoes. I have made this with small white fish fillets (crappie mostly, see my pic) and it works great.

This was delicious and my whole family loved it. As mentioned the cheese is a definite must for the added flavor. Also I used panko crumbs and it worked wonderfully. I think any really flavorful cracker crumbs would work well. Also I used 1 1/3 lbs of fish and had plenty of breading plus extra left. I think you could go up to 1 1/2 or 2 lbs of fish and still have enough. Also next time I think I would cut down a bit on the butter, maybe just over 1/4 c as it seemed like a lot although the flavor was delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this. Sorta. I prepared the ingredients, then realized I had forgotten I changed my mind at the last minute and bought Steelhead Trout instead of Walleye. I cooked for 15m only, since most recipes seem to have Steelhead cooking a little faster. It still turned out excellent.

Used town house crackers instead of the mashed potatoes. Would also cut the salt in half just on the verge of being a little salty. But maybe the it was the melted butter I served it with that pushed it over the top. Will definitely make it again.

Way healthier than the way my husband usually chooses to make it!! And tasted very similar.  He states that he missed the taste of shore lunch.  I would think you could substitute shore lunch for one of the third cup ingredients. Often times he includes saltines which I would anticipate could also be substituted.  Just not sure how doing both at the same time would change the flavor.  We also added a little Cajun seasoning and Garlic pepper tonight.

This could have really used much more seasoning.

I don't care for fish at all.  This was yummy.  I put my seasonings in my egg wash and I also double dipped/breaded my fish.  I also mixed it up a bit by crushing some Texas Toast garlic butter croutons and mixing them with my Parmesan and bread crumbs.  Quite tasty even if I do say so myself.

Didn't have potato flakes or bread crumbs so I used panko to substitute for both.  I added dill and cayenne powder but didn't add seasoned salt which was  mistake- this needs the salt!  We turned over each piece of fish halfway through the baking time and both sides were perfect.

It was OK. I thought it lacked flavor. Walleye is mild already, so I was hoping the breading would bring a bit more to the party. The crunch was good and gave it that fried texture while being healthier.

Great recipe.  Made just as described and it turned out awesome.  I've been asked for the recipe a few times.
