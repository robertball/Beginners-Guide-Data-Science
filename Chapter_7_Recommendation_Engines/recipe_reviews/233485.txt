this is delicious.  we enjoyed it the night we made it, then used the bones to make broth.  we froze the leftover turkey and used it to make a casserole one night, a "turkey salad" for lunch another day, and turkey egg scramble still another!  who says a gorgeous roasted turkey and leftover creatives should be for Thanksgiving only!!??

Nothing beats a roast turkey! And although it was a little on the sweeter side, overall it was very tasty. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the gravy, but it was a nice departure from traditional turkey gravy.

WHY do we only make turkey for Thanksgiving or Christmas? My family loves a roast turkey - OMG - they were fighting over it while I was trying to take pictures! I bought a 9 lb. turkey - just a small one to feed my family of 4 and a friend that is visiting us from NJ. I was all set to make the gravy - had all of the ingredients ready, but when I took the turkey out of the wrap - BONUS - Butterball know includes a concentrated turkey gravy in the cavity of their turkeys!  Change of plans - as I wasn't sure how my family would have liked the cranberry pan gravy anyway - so I went with the included gravy packet and prepared it as directed on the packet. It was delicious gravy, by the way. I did add a bit of olive oil to the lemon juice (because I wanted the skin to crisp up nicely) and also gave it a sprinkle of salt and pepper before placing in the oven.  As for the maple syrup, I read other reviewers comments that the drippings were too sweet, so I just basted the turkey twice, maybe using 1/8 of a cup of syrup, just enough to coat the bird, but not so much that it was dripping down. It added just the right amount of sweetness for us. Yum!

I couldn't find it in myself to make cranberry gravy.  As it was, Grumpy would not eat anymore of the gravy that I did make because the maple syrup made it too sweet.  I will stick to a traditional roasted turkey.  Turkey itself was delicious, but all the pan drippings are a waste with the sweetness that is in there.

This was absolutely wonderful!  Made for a family dinner and it went over so well.  I'll admit, I skimped on ingredients- I didn't use pure maple syrup, just what I had in the pantry.  I also didn't have fresh sage, so I used dried.  I kept the flavors the same, but I made the sauce differently than called for in the recipe.  I used fresh cranberries and cooked them in the cranberry juice with 1/2 C of OJ, brown sugar, and a little cinnamon.  Brought to a boil and cooked the cranberries down.  I simmered until the turkey was done, then added the drippings to the cranberry mixture before adding in corn starch slurry.  Raves all around, people topped EVERYTHING on their plates with it and kept asking for the recipe.

I really liked this, I think the only reason for 4 is because my go to recipe for Turkey is just better... this was an excellent fall back though.  I made this exactly as stated except that I put foil over to start and meant to pull it off and forgot so my turkey looks naked! and that I added pepper and salt. I pulled together a delicious soup with the remainder.  This was very good and I would make it again.

Yummy...I love turkey! I agree with others, though; this recipe was a bit too sweet. Although it was a great way to switch things up, I probably wouldn't trade in my regular recipe for roasted turkey. Either way, though, the Butterball turkey was so delicious!

You can't go wrong with a delicious, maple-basted whole ButterballÂ® turkey.  The meat just fell off the bone.  The maple gave the turkey just the right about of sweetness (not overpowering) and the cranberry gravy was off the chain.  Served with a side (I chose carrots), you have the perfect meal.  We ate EVERY BIT of this turkey in about two days (even using the bones for a soup and a stock).  Outstanding.

We really enjoyed this. I had a 10lb turkey and followed the recipe pretty closely. I was a little short on time, so I cooked this at 350 degrees for 2 hours and let it rest about 30 minutes while I made the gravy. I did salt and pepper the turkey for seasoning, and I changed the amount of maple syrup. I only used 1/4 cup of the maple syrup and it turned out great. I really liked the texture and flavor the syrup added. I also really liked the gravy! It made way too much, so next time I would probably half it for this size turkey. We liked the flavor very much. The cranberry went well with the pan drippings and really had a perfect mix of sweet and acidic. It was a pleasant surprise as I really didn't think it was going to be to my liking. Thanks, Butterball!

I liked the maple syrup basting idea.  It gave the meat a nice flavor with the lemon and sage.  The cranberry flavored gravy was one flavor too many for my liking.  I like all the flavors individually, but not together.  So I went ahead and made another pot of plain turkey gravy and we were all happy.

I was really hoping to like this, but I am not a big fan of maple. I was hoping the maple wouldn't flavor the meat too much, but I definitely noticed it. I actually gifted the first turkey I made to my neighbors (they just had a death in the family so it worked out.) and I made another one. With the second turkey I omitted the lemon juice and maple and just used olive oil, salt, and pepper. Much more suited to  my family's tastes for our Turkey Tuesday dinner.

Can't go wrong with a Butterball recipe for a whole turkey!  This was delicious.
