I never thought these ingredients would be good together but thought I would give it a try as an experiment, and it is really delicious!!  My husband ate two plates full.  In fact everyone in the family really liked it--even my extremely picky 7 year old son.  After much negotiating to get my son to try a bite of pork chop, I knew he liked it because he didn't run and spit it out.  When I asked him if he liked it he told me no, but about 2 minutes after he swallowed the first bite he asked me for a plate of the pork chop.  THIS IS A KEEPER!  I will be making this VERY EASY recipe often.  The pork chops turned out so tender and the sauce is awesome!  Thank you so much for sharing this!!!

Don't let the canned soup scare you.  This is doesn't carry the usual canned soup recipe disappointment. It couldn't be easier and the flavors are just fantastic. Next time I'm going to try throwing some veggie's--mushrooms & maybe onions--into the mix.  This is a recipe really worth trying.  Thanks for sharing.

I know what you're thinking: cream of mushroom soup and soy sauce? Yuck-o!   But NO! After about six hours, these pork chops were absolutely delectable. Moist, fell apart in the crock pot, perfect. I think what happens is the brown sugar and the salt from the soy sauce (I used lower-salt) effectively tenderize the pork chops. Cooked slowly with the soup finishes them off (not to mention makes an awesome gravy)! Will definitely make again - thanks for a great recipe! :)

DELICIOUS with very few ingredients.  Mistakenly I poured all of the marinating soy sauce into the crockpot, but managed to remove some of it.  Just added more soup and a little extra sugar to compensate.....making extra sauce.  Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly for the most part.  The only things I did differently was to use low sodium soy sauce and I added a can of mushrooms to the soup.  Very easy and very good!  Will def make again!

Like others have said, you wouldn't expect the ingredients to go together well.  But they do.  I halved the soysauce because I don;t like salt. I rubbed the chops with the brown sugar and then placed them in a giant ziplock bag with the soysauce and flipped them over 3 times over a 2 hour time. Then I followed the rest exactly.  Served with a pot of steamed white rice...It was quick and easy and gone in a flash.  My teenage son ate three...he loved them and I did too.  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

The sodium content scared me to death, so to lower it, I used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium soup.  I also didn't marinate mine in the soy sauce, but coated it lightly after the brown sugar was put on.  I used four nice thick chops and cooked it a long time (7 hours)and it just fell apart.  And because it's meat, I just had to add a little garlic...Very good!

This turned out lovely - so easy to make and tasty. All I changed was I added some garlic powder and minced onion to the brown sugar rub and marinated a bit longer. I was also serving with mashed potatoes so I added an extra can of soup along with real mushrooms. So good!

This came out good. If I make them again will make it just like the recipe calls for.  I added mushrooms to this recipes and they really didn't go well with this flavors.

I had a full jar of soy sauce lying around and was looking for something to easy to make with it. These chops Came out awesome. My husband and I enjoyed it. I used thin porkchops so I cooked it for about 3-4 hours. The meat just fell apart. Also, I marinated it a little longer than what the recipie called for. Will make again

We decided to give this one a try.  As everybody has mentioned, it was very easy to make.  We didn't think however that it knocked our socks off.  It almost seemed as though the brown sugar and soy sauce 'cured' the chops so to speak, making them taste more like ham.  We had leftovers so the second night we added sour cream, that gave it a stroganoff taste and it was much better.

I wondered how these ingredients would blend together but wow was Iimpressed. I used 1 can of reduced fat low sodium cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup (all I had on hand), added fresh mushrooms and some minced garlic. I let the chops (thin, boneless) marinate for about an hour and then cooked them on high for 3-4 hours. They were so tender you could cut with a fork. I served over mashed potatoes and the sauce was AMAZING!! I will make these again and cook on low all day while at work!!

This is my new favorite pork recipe.  The three ingredients were so surprising... they transform into an amazing pork gravy!  I couldn't believe it.  This recipe is great with a side of mashed potatoes.  I've made these pork chops four times now and the best results are with thinner chops.  They get so tender and stay the juiciest.  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe!!!

For those having trouble with the results being dried out-two things. First, you may need a a pork chop cut with some fat on it. And second, if your chops are on the thin side, or are leaner, you will need to reduce the cooking time. If it is dry something went wrong. There should be a good amount of gravy with the pork chops. Also,do not add the soy sauce marinade to the crockpot. You can add it, but it will make it saltier and really changes the outcome of this récipe. Ive tried both ways, and I much prefer without the soy sauce. Otherwise the soy sauce flavor is too strong and overpowers everything else.

Super yummy, as and about as easy to make as it gets! I also was apprehensive about putting these ingredients together but they really blend well. We make this often, especially in the winter...

My family LOVES this dinner!  I followed the recipe exactly except I don't use 6 pork chops, just 3-4 of the really thick ones.  I have also used 2 cans of the cream of mushroom to make a little more gravy.  I serve ours over egg noodles and it's delicious!  SO EASY and SO YUMMY!

I thought this was pretty good & I would fix it again. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it was 'knock you socks off'. But, it is definitely worth trying if you're locking for a easy fix dinner. I only fixed 3 pork chops because 6 would have been way too many for us. I didn't measure the brown sugar because I didn't have much left, I just sprinkled it over each side and rubbed it in. I also didn't measure the soy sauce, I just poured about 1/2 inch to 1 inch in the dish, put the chops on top after turning a few times in the sauce then covered & refrigerated for 1 hr. I did flip the chops after 1/2 an hour. Since the chops were only 1/2 inch thick & there was only 3 I only cooked them for 4 hrs on low. Which was perfect, any longer would have been too much. The chops were tender, juicy and falling apart.

Based on some great reviews we hesitatingly gave this a try.  Unfortunately, it was a waste of ingredients.  I now know that under no circumstance do sugar and cream of mushroom go together!

I wasn't real impressed by this recipe but after reading the reviews I decided I had to give it a try. How could something so simple be so good? My whole family raved about this meal. Even my daughter who doesn't care for pork chops said this is a keeper. I will be making this again soon. Absolutely fantastic!!!

I have made this recipe in a sauce pan because I didn't have time to let it slow cook and it turned out great. I tried in in a crockpot for the first time today and it was excellent. I did add one diced onion, 3 fresh thinly sliced carrots, pepper, garlic and onion powder and a little sour cream. YUM!

I Love this and give it 5 stars, my husband said 4 stars, but I am the cook so I say 5.  he thought it was a little salty, so next time I will use low sodium mushroom soup, I used low sodium soy sauce.  They only thing I did different was I used 2 cans of soup.  i dont know how mushroom soup and pork chops could make such a great sauce.  I made rice and put the sauce and chops over that and it was a GREAT dinner.  Love this, will make soon.  thank you!!  So easy too!!

This was the basis of a great recipe for me. I did change it quite a bit to suit our needs. 1) i generously sprayed the crockpot with cooking spray. 2) i put in 4 FROZEN bone in pork chops  3) i sprinkled onion soup mix over the chops 4) i put 2 medium sliced potatoes on top of the soup mix. 5) i dumped in the cream of mushroom soup, a little soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. 6) i cooked it on high for 1 hour, then reduced to low for 5 hours. It was delicious. Next time i will add some frozen brussel sprouts in the last hour of cooking for an incredible one dish meal. Don't be afraid to play with this recipe, it is a great starting point.

Surprisingly delicious. Taking the advice of other reviewers I added some additional seasoning to the brown sugar and added fresh mushrooms to the soup. Meat was tender and the meal was a zip to throw together. I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker so I just did it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 375 degrees. I browned the pork chops before hand, added fresh mushrooms, did the brown sugar and soy sauce as stated and put 2 cans of mushroom soup, served over rice.

My husband said that these were excellent!  I was very leery looking at the combination of ingredients, but it is very good. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup as others suggested.  Didn't bother to measure out brown sugar, I just rubbed some into the pork chop.  It is necessary to flip halfway through to prevent too much browning!

My Husband liked this but I found it to be a bit salty. Not too sure I liked the smell of it either. This dish was just ok. I give three stars because the pork was tender and it was in a nice sauce...just a bit salty for my taste.

Simple and wonderful!  I did not have the Mushroom soup so used a packet of mushroom gravy thickened with flour and milk to give it more substance. I rubbed LOTS of brown sugar into the meat and poured ample soy sauce on the meat and then soaked the meat in that, flipping it over for an hour or two. After cooking in the crock pot all afternoon, the pork fell of the bone and tasted almost like a Chinese dish.  It reminded me of Beef Pepper Steaks or something close to that. It would be nice to throw some broccoli and water chestnuts in for the last hour. I served the pork over a bed of white rice.  Eggrolls served as a side dish would be nice.  When my husband came home from work, he said the house smelled so delicious.  He complimented me on the food over and over.  We have 3 hogs in the freezer so I need lots of different recipes to cook the pork so it does not get dull and boring eating so much of it. I will make this again for sure and share the simple recipe with family and friends.  I love it!

This was AMAZING! I agree with other reviewers that it didn't sound appealing at first, but wow I'm so glad I tried it! I only used two chops and also added some garlic powder, chili powder, and cayenne to the brown sugar, but other than that I followed the instructions (other than using low-sodium soy sauce). So easy, and my family ate it up with no leftovers. Plus, the sauce was fantastic!

This was very easy to put together. I didn't think it was too bad. My parents really liked it but my husband did not. The ingredients sound unappetizing but it was good. Even so I'm not sure that I would make it again.

Very good!  I added mushrooms & served it over couscous.  I cooked it for 7 hours--should've taken it out at 6 hours--the chops on the top were slightly dry.  But they still fell apart when I tried to take them out of the crockpot.  Super easy to prepare!  Will make again!

Great recipe.  Husband hates anything cooked in the crock pot, but he LOVED this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only marinated in a little bit of soy, rather than a whole bottle.  This gravy is fantastic.

I made these when my husband came back from a deployment and we both thought they were incredible. They are very easy to make and literally fall apart when you start to eat them. The sugar and saltiness of the soy sauce make a nice mix. I didn't cook mine in a slow cooker, I just browned the chops and then threw it all in a baking dish and baked them for as long as I could stand. Excellent with rice!

I ended up rubbing minced onion and garlic powder into the chops before marinating, and then marinated overnight.  I slow cooked 6 pork chops (they were about 3/4" thick) for 4 hours on low and they turned out GREAT.  I thought, as usual, that I'd need a steak knife for my pork chop but when I stabbed it with a fork it just fell apart! Hubby says we must have again.. but next time I think I'll try some more spices.  It did seem a little bit bland.

Great recipe! Husband and kids liked it and will be making it again.  I didn't have any problems with it like so many reviews stated, but I read them and followed tips. I had 4 chops - small - 5 oz, butterflied.  I followed some other tips and cooked on low for 4 hours because they were thin- perfect! After reading reviews I was worried about burning or dryness so I used 2 cans of soup.  Absolutely moist and delish - and plenty of excess so there was no chance of dryness.  Used reduced sodium soy so I did not experience them being salty.  I can understand other reviews about being bland - there is flavor but husband likes more punch so he put quite a bit of pepper on.  I will make the same way again or might throw in chopped onion and red potatoes to see how it turns out.  The soup is very liquidy in the end - which is fine.  Probably great with mashed potatoes. If you know how I am sure it would be fabulous thickened into a gravy.

So easy to make and a definite keeper! I usually don't have a lot of time to make dinner so this recipe is perfect and it tastes like you put a ton of time into it! I did cut back on the soy sauce and added onions to the sauce, and it was a wonderful meal served up with some good ol' fashion mashed potatoes.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. So did my husband and kids. And the kicker was how easy it was to make. I think when I buy steaks next time, I will go ahead and but a few in bags with the brown sugar and soy sauce on them and freeze them that way. Then all I would have to do is throw them in the crock pot over the soup and done. I love it.

I really was skeptical, but 9 out of 9 people saying it's good must mean something, right? Well, I don't even have a slow cooker and it was still delicious! Next time, I will add veggies and onions to the mix, but as is, this recipe is REALLY good!

Very easy to make. The chops came out very moist and tasty. I got a late start so I put the crock on high for an hour and then low for about 4 hours.

Hands down delicious!  Sounded kind of weird but glad I gave it a shot anyway.  I followed recipe as stated until the pork was finished cooking.  I removed the pork and shredded it, then added a touch of heavy cream to liquid, and added pork back to the crockpot to simmer for a minute.  Served over rice and my husband and I were amazed.  Definitely making again :)

I was reluctant to try this recipe, but I make a great French Dip with soy sauce, so I gave this a try. Every one in my family ate it.  Even my two picky sons.  My husband says it was the best pork chop I have ever made!  I thickened the sauce on the stove top, and served over mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I made this dish for my Husband last night. It turned out wonderfully. It's very easy to make and really flavorful. I marinated the chops in soy sauce overnight and  coated with brown sugar about two hours prior to cooking. I will definitely make this dish again. The only thing i wll do differently next time is use the less sodium soy sauce. The cream of mushroom paired with the soy makes for a lot of salt.

I cook slow cooker meals on Sundays and my husband and I loved it! It was quick and easy as long as you remember that you need to marinate the pork chops about an hour prior. The pork chops ended up falling off the bone and it was so tasty we plan on making it again!

Very tasty. Used low sodium soy and healthy choice soup- didn't measure the brown sugar but just rubbed enough into cover the chops.  I squished it all up in a gallon size zip bag and stuck in the fridge overnight.  I didn't have the too salty issues other reviewers had.  After cooking for 8 1/2 hours on low, there wasn't much sauce left, but the chops were fall apart tender.  I added about 6oz sour cream to extend the sauce.  The results were a bit stroganoff-ish, tasty but very rich!  Served over rice.  Next time I will add an extra can of soup instead- and there will be a next time- this was great!

This dish was very tender, but the flavors just didn't appeal to my family.  I think it was just too sweet for us.  I added cornstarch to the cooked juices to make a gravy for it.

I have not yet worked up the nerve to try this recipe with the cream of mushroom soup.  I'm sure I will be surprised at the melding of the tastes and will try it next time!!  I used butterfly pork chops, pressed in Splenda brown sugar and marinated in the soy sauce as directed.  Added a little more soy sauce and a dab of water to the crockpot when I cooked them and WOW!!  I have been looking for a crockpot recipe for pork that isn't bland, and this is it.

I liked the recipe alot, because it is inexpensive and simple. I didnt rock my world, but my family and I enjoyed it. I at mine on a bed of mashed potatoes. Husband and daughter ate theirs over rice. We had black eyed peas on the side. A very good choice and good the next day as leftovers!

This was very tasty,  although not spectacular.  Definitely worth making.  Very easy to set up and a great meal to make when you are not going to have a ton of time at meal time for preparation.  Keep an eye on them though.  I don't know if my slow cooker runs a little hot but they seemed to be done already at around 5 hours.

This was very nice and easy. I found the sauce a bit salty but as I served it with plain rice it worked out fine. I also cut down the sugar a bit as I’m watching my sugar intake. Next time I’ll try low sodium soy sauce. It was super easy to make  and I’ll definitely do it again. Thank you for sharing

What an amazing surprise this was! Easy, delish and a real wowzer. Who knew these ingredients worked so well together? Pork was so tender, we cut it with a spoon! Followed the recipe exact except added an additional can of shroom soup and a few carrots and onions because I needed to use them. Really good. Fam loved it. Will absolutely make again!

I used low sodium soy sauce but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I think this is a good base recipe. Personally, I'd add more seasonings to the pork chops on both sides after marinating. I would also distribute the soup evenly over each piece so each chop cooks in it instead of only the bottom pieces getting soup. Overall tender and pretty good.

Other than add about 1/2 cup water to the cream of mushroom soap I followed the recipe.  Served with mashed potatoes with the sauce on top & green beans.  We found this to be bland. The pork chops were fork tender but really couldn’t taste any seasonings. Doubt that I’ll make this again.

My second time making this , it is awesome! The only thing I did different was that I used 4 pork chops and added peeper and garlic powder to the cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of pouring the mixture on bottom, I put some on bottom, then on each chop. It came out great!!

Wow - phenomenal! No leftovers on this and we doubled the recipe. Let it marinate just a tad bit longer and if you use a thinner porkchop, low on 3-3.5 hours does the trick.

Yummy. I added extra can of soup and cooked in a Dutch oven for 2 hours instead of a crockpot. At the end I mixed a half cup of sour cream and serve over noodles.  Family says it's a keeper.

Very easy recipe. However, it just didn't have the wow factor. I added extra mushrooms, a bit of garlic and onion powder. Sorry, didn't help.

I made this for dinner and since I wasn't able to do it earlier in the day, I only marinated it for 30minutes and cooked it on high in my slow cooker for 3 hours. It still turned out good! The meat was tender, the flavors infused. I'm glad I had some sauce left over because I think I will reuse it to cook some chicken another day this week. Quick to make and yummy!

It was easy to make and tasty, but the smell is a little off-putting. And as someone else commented, it kinda tasted like ham, which I wasn't expecting. I'm not sure if I'd make it again. Hoping that the leftovers are better, as they usually are with most foods.

I was running short on time and thought that this was a baking recipe not a slow cooker, so I had to modify the cooking. I browned my meat, after it was done marinating, and then put the soup mix in a baking pan topped with the chops and  I added a can of mushrooms to the mix covered it in foil and baked it on 375 for about an hour. I paired it with mashed potatoes using the soup mixture as a gravy.  I would probably use thicker pieces of meat next time as mine were only 8 oz each.

Super huge hit with my two teenaged boys!  I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup and added some of the soy sauce into the crock pot when I put in the pork.  SO YUM!

Meat was tender but dry,  overall a very bland dinner. I would not recommend it. There are many other ways to prepare porkchops far exceeding this recipe in flavor and presentation.

This is a surprisingly simple and delicious recipe! I used boneless tenderloin pork steak, a lot less soy, and baked in a glass dish in oven! Definitely worth trying!

These were very easy and the meat was very tender.  I served them with buttered egg noodles and the peas with mushrooms recipe from this site.

The only great thing I can say about this recipe is that it came out very tender. Otherwise, my family did not like it at all. Even my non-picky husband thought the soy sauce flavor was over-powering. Will not make again.

Very easy. And yes, the pork chops were edible, but not nearly as good as the rave reviews.  I don't think I will prepare this recipe again.

This was really good, except it was a bit too salty tasting.  I think I will either do one of two things next time I try this recipe.  Use a lower sodium soy sauce, or use less soy sauce during the marinating.    But definitely tasty!

This was awesome! Great flavor! Pork chops fell apart! We had it over mashed potatoes and over white rice! Awesome both ways! We love salty food, but if you don't like salt that much, make sure you use low sodium soy!!!
