This is a pretty good and simple chicken recipe. There are other equally good and simple variations of this recipes I have made. One I have done is mixing seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I have also made it as is, but subtituted french fried onions for the onion soup mix. I think the key is more likely the mayonaise that keeps the chicken tender. I also flatten the chicken slightly, so it cooks evenly. Only downside is that there is no sauce or gravy.
**EDIT NOTE: I made again today on the stove and it was even more "tender" and much quicker than baking. I used chicken tenderloins. I didn't have any more mayo so I used a mock buttermilk and let soak for 30 minutes. I then mixed the 1st two ingredients to taste using plain bread crumbs. I heated about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan on medium and cooked on both sides for about 7-8 minutes total. I served this time, like a chicken tender, with Honey Mustard Dressing II also from the site.

This is a great recipe. For better results, refrigerate the breaded chicken for about an hour. Really helps the panko and onion seasoning to stick to the chicken.

This really was good. Key to the coating adhering is to make sure you dry your chicken pieces well. I've used both whole, cut up chicken, and chicken breasts. Both turned out well. I love how easy it is. Takes but a few minutes to coat the chicken then you forget about it for the next 45 minutes or so while you make some side dishes. I forgot to add that I used regular breadcrumbs because that's all I had. I'm going to make this often.Thanks for a great, quick recipe.

This was okay, however the boyfriend enjoyed it. I found it a bit bland, so next time I will season the chicken well. I like a complex taste so I could be just too picky! I coated the chicken with the mix and refrigerated for one hour so the breading would stay on the chicken. Don't cut into the chicken if you can help it as the juices will cause the breading to become soggy and fall off.  I also used Miracle Whip spread on with a knife as it is what we had and it was just fine

This is our new favorite! I did not have panko crumbs so I used Asian Honey Sesami coating instead with the soup mix. I did as suggested with other reviewers, I dried the chicken and did pound it. This was very moist and was loved by all.

When I need to get dinner in the oven quickly, this is the recipe I'll use! I didn't have onion soup mix, so I used a half packet of italian salad dressing mix and it was so good. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks...so moist!

My husband LOVED these, I though they were a little on the salty side, but they were pretty good.  We made it with chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.  It was quick and easy.  :)

Just finished eating this simply prepared dish. I used less mayo than called for, which worked out fine since I only made 3 thin-cut breasts. Added a sprinkling of garlic powder and pepper to the panko/onion soup mix for a little extra flavor. I found that 425 degrees burned a few of the onion flakes after 10 minutes in the oven, so I adjusted the temp to 400 degrees and baked a total of 20 min, which rendered perfectly baked chicken. Good flavor and can be made fairly quickly on busy weeknights. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and a side of steamed broccoli.

This was a really good easy recipe. The chicken was moist, however the crumb mixture on the bottom of the chicken got a little soggy for some reason. I think next time I will also add some spices to add a little more flavor. However, I think that this recipe is good for a quick night dinner. I will make this again.

I couldn't find Panko crumbs so I ended up using original flavored Chicken Shake n Bake and only a half bag of dry onion soup mix but added some onion and garlic salts. It still turned out pretty yummy! Even cutting back the onion soup, I still thought it was a little too onion-y, but what else should I have expected from the title? :) It was tasty nonetheless!

I made this exact recipe based on things I had on hand a few weeks ago, and was browsing through my recipe box and found this recipe! Only thing I did different was added a little ranch dressing to my mayo because I didn't have enough. It was very good, but very salty.

This is one of our standard go-to meals. It's super easy, very tasty, and you can substitute any bread crumb. This is good for kids and adults. The onion mix may be salty for some, so start with the recipe and, if needed, cut back on the onion mix the next time. But we like it the way the recipe is written. Thanks for countless lazy but hit the spot dinners!

My 7 year-old daughter and I made this together. She was so excited to help out when it came to dipping the chicken and putting it in the onion mixture. It turned out perfect without adding anything to it. My husband loved it and the kids gobbled it up. :)

I used 3/4 dry onion soup mix since I had Italian style Panko crumbs. I didn't bother to measure the mayo and bread crumbs. Just added more if necessary. The mix amount was fine with us, it wasn't too oniony, but boy was it salty. Turns out salt is the second ingredient after onion. Anyway, we enjoyed it, I REALLY enjoyed the fact that it was quick and easy.

Excellent! I don't rate a recipe if I changed it so you can believe it when I say, I made it as written. Only difference was that I had to cut my chicken breasts into chicken "strips" so I could stretch 3 chicken breasts for 4 people. I do not think that really altered the recipe. These were nice and crispy on the outside and wonderfully tender and moist on the inside. Served with stuffing and gravy with a side salad. Everyone cleared their plates! Thank you!

I added 3 tbsp of ketchup to the mayo when covering the chicken and a bit more hot sauce than suggested. I served it for Sunday dinner this evening with a creamy pasta (cold) salad and it turned out awesome. Looking forward to making it another time!

Made this as a last resort when I needed a fast meal. I followed the recipe and my little children loved it. My husband did too, he thought I bought it at a restaurant.

This was a bit too salty for me.  Though the chicken was super duper tender and moist, and the breading stayed on very nicely.  I will probally use the idea of the mayonnaise again, I might just substitute the onion soup for something ele.

Enjoyed the chicken.  I made my own bread crumbs since I needed to get ride of some older bread.  My husband hates mayo so in an effort to keep him unbias I used a little squeez butter (about 3 tablespoons for 3 chicken breast).    I also used pre-frozen bag chicken.  Since they are frozen in water I did cut in half and pound between papertowls to make sure dry.  Chicken was still very moist.  My husband and 6 yr old daughter liked it.  Easy meal to rotate in to our meals but not something we will crave.

super easy, I had thin chicken cutlets and was going to attempt chicken marsala for the first time but had just gotten through a botched mashed potato fiasco and wanted something easy.  These were juicy and tender, boyfriend who hates mayo loved them.  Ratios were perfect and cook time for thin chicken breasts was spot on.

Family enjoyed it but found is a tad too salty (followed directions to the T).  Next time I will increase the amount of panko bread crumbs to offset the onion mix a tad more.

Fast, easy, and flavorful.  Our family loved this recipe.  It was a nice change of pace.  Goes great with mac & cheese.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream to give it a twist.

Very good! I didn't have onion soup mix, so I seasoned the bread crumbs with salt, onion powder, and Old Bay. Turned out great! The seasoning can be played with, but the chicken comes out so juicy. Will definitely make again!

This chicken was so easy to make and delicious to eat.  Crunchy outside, moist & tender inside.  I cut it down to a meal for one - using 2 drumsticks and 2 teaspoons of onion soup mix to 1/4 cup (+) Panko flakes.   The suggestion to coat it and let it rest in frig for at least 1/2 hour was a good one.  I also baked them on a rack in the over so no grease pooling or coating sticking to the foil.

It was terrific. Best baked chicken I have ever eaten. Followed directions but made sure to brine the chicken with a 1/4 cup of salt and 1/4 cup of basil for 24 hours. Delicious, simple and a must make.

Oh My God!! This Chicken is SOOOOOOO salty!! Like the other review suggested.. Use only Half of the Onion Mix, and To be honest it taste plain in the meat.. the season only on the skin which is UNEATABLE cuz its so salty.. I would marinate it with soy sauce, give flavor for the chicken meat inside.. its only flavor on the outside only.. quite boring.

Simple and good.  I forgot the mayo on the first few pieces (oops -smile) but I did dip them in melted margarine which still worked out. My daughter reminded me half way in that I was suppose to use mayo and not margarine (not sure where I got the idea for margarine - must have been another one of the many recipes I was reading). Anyway, the chicken tasted good with both (mayo & margarine). The mayo pieces were more moist, but both ways tasted good. I also added season salt to my panko bread crumb mix and used bone-in chicken legs and wings. These were good and I will make again.

I thought this was very good and easy. I made it with cut up chicken winglets. Was worried it might be too strong; not so, it was just the right flavor for wings. I was leaving to buy expensive french fried onions to make onion chicken so l was glad I came across this yummy onion chicken recipe first. Looking forward to making it with chicken breasts too.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. My husband commented on how juicy they were. I marinated first in an Italian dressing. Don't know if this added anything to the recipe, but it didn't hurt it!. We will definitely have this again. I used Italian bread crumbs because that was what I had on hand. I think when I make again, I might use just plain bread crumbs. A very delicious, easy recipe.
