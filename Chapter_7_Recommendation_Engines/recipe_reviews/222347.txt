simply amazing! Wouldn't change anything except maybe doubling the recipe. Is very decadent and simply wonderful, even if you're not a huge coffee fan. Never had a complaint.

made this today for my Halloween party! Delicious and VERY decadent! I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for milk, but the flavors blended beautifully. I used coffee ice cream- It was a giant, delicious bowl tasted just like a Starbucks iced mocha. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great! I kept the leftovers in my fridge for a couple of days before throwing the rest out. I will definitely be making this again!

Thank God I found the recipe here....I lost the one a friend gave me of this exact one!  It's amazing!!  Yes, you'll like it even if you don't like coffee.  We have it every year at my ice cream party.  Worst part is that you can't make it ahead very easily.  And I always have to double the batch.  Enjoy!

Nice idea, and would be very good if made with natural ingredients, but all I could taste were the chemicals in the whipped topping, the drink mix, the instant coffee, etc.

This is a lovely dessert for mocha lovers. Very delicious and decadent. I didn`t have cream to make whipped cream, so made without. Thanks for posting.

This is a really good recipe if you want to serve chocolate milkshakes.  It had no coffee taste at all and I added more instant coffee than it called for.  I probably used a half cup, but the chocolate flavor completely overwhelms...not a bad thing, I love chocolate, but definitely wouldn't call it a mocha punch.

Loved this! I didn't read the recipe before the morning I needed this so I made a quick "cross my fingers" alteration. I'll share for anyone else it might help. 

I boiled half the amount of water, added the sugar, coffee, and chocolate drink mix (although I didn't have any chocolate drink mix so I omitted this ingredient and my guests said that it was amazing without it). Stired to dissolve, then added the additional half of water to cool it. Then added my ice cream and cool whip. This recipe is seriously the best ever!

I also made this for my daughter's bridal shower, as did the original recipe contributor.  And it was also a huge hit!  Followed the recipe exactly as is.  I had so many compliments, and this punch has become legendary in my daughter's circle of friends.  I have been asked to share many, many times for special occasions.

This was a hit at our volunteer appreciation luncheon.  I have already been asked to share the recipe.  Instead of buying two half gallons of ice cream, I used a gallon of vanilla fudge swirl ice cream.  I also added 4 cups milk.  It was delicious.
