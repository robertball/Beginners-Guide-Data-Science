Definitely very good! The fish was flaky and perfect! I had the exact amount of fish but I doubled the seasoning mixture. Then put half on one side and then flipped and added the rest of the mixture. Then placed in the oven to cook

I didn't have seafood seasoning but I came up with my own and it was easy and delish.  Will absolutely make again.

About tripled the ingredients for the pour over... turned out great! Used lemon pepper instead of seafood seasoning.

Not being a fish lover, I was hesitant to try this recipe.

I loved it and so did both of my sons!  We will be making it, again, soon!

My 14yr old and I loved these! Very quick and easy, and I did sub shredded cabbage for the lettuce because I like it better on fish tacos. The non-stick Reynolds Wrap foil made it a breeze! YUM!!!!

The fish was flaky and succulent. Very good recipe. I used corn tortillas because they were in the fridge. Make sure to use crisp lettuce for a balance in texture.

I used Old Bay instead of seafood seasoning. It wasn't boring at all, and my family likes highly seasoned foods. The lime, red pepper, and mango salsa make a nice combination. Quick, easy and colorful. Kid loved them.

Very bland and boring recipe.
