Great flavor! This is definitely a fall off the bone beer can chicken which makes it difficult to carve. Nonetheless it will be a repeat recipe.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have an infuser, or a baster the first time I made it, so I just drizzled the melted garlic infused butter all over the bird, and then applied the rub. It turned out very well and was a huge hit.

Awesome! Flavor is great; chicken is tender and juicy. I didn't have an injector, so I loosened the skin on all sides and poured the butter mixture into it. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. My new go-to chicken recipe ... this puts the grocery store roasted chicken to shame.

Instead of in the oven I put in on the grill with some cherry wood. Great recipe.

I thought this was a pretty yummy recipe.  I found it had a bit more pepper flavor than my preference (1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon black pepper).  I actually had a 4.5 lbs bird and my bird was done at 350 about 1.5 hours in so depending on your oven (mine is extremely efficient) keep an eye on it.  Only thing I'd add is rinsing the chicken with cold water and patting it dry otherwise the skin can't crisp.  I found my turkey was to 165 BEFORE the crust had fully crisped/settled.  It tasted great but the skin got soft/wet quickly, especially when trying to get it off the can . . . though the can I used was a tall beer so that may have been why I struggled.
