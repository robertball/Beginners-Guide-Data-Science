I had a hard time eating this the first night, but for whatever reason, it tasted MUCH better as leftovers 24 hours later. I also added some celery to it because I had it laying around.

It was good and very healthy, thank you. However, I found the chicken to be bland and the next time I'll add garlic to the chicken or a caper sauce.  I chopped up 2 cups sweet potatoes in a chucky hash and cooked with sweet onion until golden.  I had more cauliflower to cook so I probably doubled the recommendation. Due to that, I had to compensate to overcome the cauliflower bitterness. So I plump up dried cranberries in warm water, chopped fine and added. Also toasted 1/4 cup sliced almonds to add. Lastly, I lightly drizzled about 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup. I'm glad, my husband liked it very much. (and he hates cauliflower)

I tried this even though I didn't have cauliflower. I thought the cinnamon and nutmeg were a bit overpowering on the sweet potatoes, but maybe that's because I didn't cook them with the cauliflower rice. The chicken was tasty. I made some quinoa in chicken broth and added the sweet potatoes into that, then served the chicken over it. I would try it again when I have cauliflower.

After reading some of the less than ideal reviews, I decided to simply make a meal with the basic items cooked separately. Slice whole cauliflower thin, coat w/olive oil, salt and roast in shallow pan. Pan fry chicken but add some garlic and cook sweet potatoes as noted but add a little salt and/or butter. Why ruin good ingredients? Plus forget ricing the darn cauliflower- itâ€™s so good carmelized and roasted.

Add a clove of minced garlic to the stir frying of the cauliflower, and needed chicken broth to add extra moisture to the potatoes and cauliflower.

I used miso tamari in the cauliflower/sweet potato mix to enrich and give depth. I also used pickled lemon which is far more interesting in the chicken. I finely cut the lemon and sauteed and then added some of the pickled  juice.

I have never made a recipe on this website I have disliked until this one.  I really only wanted the cauliflower/sweet potato portion of this recipe.  I made that part of the recipe as suggested and it was so bland. The only way I could salvage this meal was to add 2 tbsps raw sugar, a tbsp of coriander, 1/2 cup finely ground onion flavored almonds, and a tbsp paprika.  It gave it a savory flavor when paired with the cinnamon and nutmeg.

Great dish!  The cauliflower rice was surprisingly good!  Although I thought this recipe could use a little more flavor my family (including my mother-in-law) thought it was perfect just as is.
