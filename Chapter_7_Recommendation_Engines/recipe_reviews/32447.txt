WOW! A blast of orange flavored slush. Wonderful taste and pretty presentation with a mint leaf to garnish.For personal taste, I reduced sugar to 1/4c and increased vanilla to 1t. Thanks Judy.

Tasty! Here's a tip...use powdered sugar so it disolves. Regular sugar can be grainy. Also don't use that nasty splenda cr*p, it's so bad for you. This is just like an orange julius!

i give this two stars because my children did love this.  my husband described it as runny syrup - what kid isnt going to love that.  it was too sweet and even though we added a lot of water to it after the initial taste, it was just too much.

This has the same familiar taste as those orange julius drinks that were such a favorite about 20 years ago!  I cut the serving size to 2, didn't use white sugar but subbed 3 tablespoons of agave sweetener in it's place.  I did use additional ice cubes and cut back  on the milk for a refreshingly thick icier drink. These will be great on a hot summer day!

I love snowmen and the name is what drew me to this one.  I really like this recipe!  I used half the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  The flavor is so bright and shiny and the texture is great.  I will definitely make it again :)  The one thing is I can't decide what it IS- is it a breakfast drink?  Dessert?  Snack?  Whatever it is, it's very yummy and right up your alley if you're a lover of orange things!  I think the reviewer below me must have accidentally used a tablespoon of vanilla extract or is really sensitive to vanilla flavor or something because the vanilla is not at all overpowering.  I'm not a fan of the vanilla-orange-cream flavor combo usually (an orange flavored medicine I had to take as a child completely turned me off to all things Creamsicle) and I think it's just dandy in this recipe.  The dominant flavor is definitely orange and the vanilla just adds a little something subtle.

Wow! This reminds me of the Orange Julius' we used to get at the mall. I really enjoyed the smooth texture and 'pop' of orange juice. Is it mean to pour mine in a much bigger glass than my boys'? Oh, well, I guess they'll pay me back with all of their sugar intake. Heh. Thank you for the recipe, Judy! We loved it!

HUGE hit! To make it creamier, I used fat free evaporated milk and I upped the vanilla to a full  two teaspoons for a double batch. My three men loved it--GREAT christmas morning beverage! NOTE: I did double this only because I read through the reviews and there were a few people who said that for four servings, it was small. So, doubling it was a must for me.

Great summer drink for kids. The creamy taste and texture defies the relative healthiness of the beverage.  We used skim milk and cut the sugar in half to a 1/4 cup - still really good.

This was like an orange creamsicle in a glass!  I cut out a bit of the sugar and added a bit more vanilla.  My 2 year old would have drank the whole pitcher if I let him!  Thanks for the yummy idea!

If you want an Orange Julius-type drink, this is the one for you. Instead of using oranje juice concentrate, we just used plain-old orange juice (we just kinda winged it, but I'm guess about 1 1/2 cups?) Also, instead of sugar we used Splenda. Not only is the Splenda better for you, but it dissolved better too, so I highly reccomend it. This is a great recipe that turns out  nice and frothy, just like Ornage Juliuses. :D

I used a bit less ice cubes. What I kept tasting was the vanilla extract, but overall this drink was less than what I expected. I will use less vanilla extract next time.

I doubled the recipe and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  Followed ingredient directions exactly but next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup or leave out completely as we thought it was a little sweet.  Very orange dreamsicle tasting and refreshing.

Great recipe! My whole family LOVED it! I second using orange juice. It works well too. 6 ounzes is fine. You can also use evaporated milk. Nice light taste. It is so good that I literally tipped my head and glass back to get every last drop!

I tried doubling up this recipe, and it came out waaaay to sugary. I don't know if this was my fault for doubling it up, or if this is just a sugary type smoothie. I'll try it again following the recipe exact and not doubling it up and see if it taste better.

Hrm.  This was 'okay'.  It's a little too orange-juice tasting for me, even with the other ingredients.  I may try it with condensed milk, though, that sounds incredibly good (if too sweet).  Good for a quick pick-me-up, in any case.  I'll experiment a bit.

This recipe is known in Puerto Rico as Champola and in Dominican Republic, instead of milk and sugar they use condensed milk.  I tried it for breakfast and I'm sure I'll be doing it again soon!!!!

pretty darn good! i didn't have milk so i used evaporated milk (1/4 evaporated milk + 1/4 water = 1/2 "milk"). i also used less sugar and added a banana making it thicker, creamier and more like a smoothie! Mmmm...

I really liked this drink and so did my picky sister-in-law. The only thing I didn't care for was the grainy texture from the sugar. I also made a batch with some strawberry preserves added, and it was delicious! Thanks!

I made something like this when I was a teenager and now I make them for my kids.  Very refreshing on a hot summer day!

mmmm...good and orange-y. I think with regular OJ, it needs a bit of sugar.

Delicious. Very easy to make in a matter of seconds for any time of the year. Good to have if you're battling a winter cold.

It is really good and healthy. Especially if you don't mistake grape fruit for oranges. I give it 5 stars because I personally don't like oranges but this drink had me  eating them for the first time in 3 years.

Awesome drink! Cut down a tad on the sugar and it was still a hit! Especially with the little ones! Top with some whipped cream for fun!

I used orange juice and agave in place of the concentrate and sugar. It was refreshing, light, and had great flavor.

The kids in my family liked this, but to the adults it tasted like sugary milk. Sure, there was a hint of orange hidden in the drink, but to me it wasn't enough to be called an ORANGE smoothie.

My daughter and I are sick with a cold, and this soothed our sore throat. Later I am going to make more with honey instead of sugar.
