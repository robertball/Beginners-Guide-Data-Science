These are so easy to make! It makes quite a bit,  I had to buy another Popsicle maker thingy! 
I didn't have mango so I used strawberries instead and they turned out great. (Im sure you could substitute other fruits and it would be just as yummy). The pineapple gives them a good texture and sweetness,  not overpowering at all.  I will make these for my kids all the time. :-)
