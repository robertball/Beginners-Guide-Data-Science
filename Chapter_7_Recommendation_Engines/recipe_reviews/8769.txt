Great recipe! I did make my own teriyaki sauce though. (Equal amounts of brown sugar and soya sauce, lots of minced garlic and fresh minced ginger) Let it sit in the fridge all afternoon, and then BBQed it. Served with rice pilaf. Very tasty! :)

We tried this recipe and thought it was tasty. I added some garlic and red pepper flakes, kind of took it to another level.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  It was so easy.  I should have made more, because all of the chicken was devoured with them wanting more.

I made a sandwich out of this. I used leftover baked chicken sliced it left in marinade for 4-6 hours. Warmed it in a pan served with sliced red onion on a toasted wheat bun. Taste like that sandwich shop.

Very good. I didn't see it was grilled but I broiled the chicken and it turned out good. Served it over chow mein noodles. My daughter told me it was "the best dinner ever"

Not my favorite. Hubby didn't like it much either. I'm a big orange-flavored anything fan. But this was just too much work for the turn out -- Nothing great here.

This was pretty good as far as chicken goes.  A little too orangey for my taste, though.  I might try it again, but I would use less orange juice.  My kids hated it, and my husband said it was just edible.

This was just okay for me. I marinated for 24 hours and grilled on stove top grill pan. Not too much flavor from the marinade.. and the marinade iself needs help.. red pepper flakes, garlic. dash of brown sugar.. rice wine vinegar.. ginger.. but that would be a different recipe. This one was a start...

Excellent recipe that is simple and quick to make. I did adjust the recipe slightly as suggested in other reviews. I added 1.5 cloves of minced garlic and 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the marinade. I marinaded the chicken breasts for about 6 hours, then cooked two large chicken breasts in a covered dish in the marinade at 375 deg F for 30 minutes. I finished cooking them on the grill 4 minutes on each side continuing to baste the chicken breasts over high heat. They were excellent!

I didn't have any orange juice in the freezer, so I substituted frozen lime juice concentrate and it was delicious--very summery. The marinade was delicious and we used the extra (after boiling of course) as a sauce on the cooked chicken.  The only thing is that it burns easily on the grill because of the sugar in the marinade, so you have to be careful.
