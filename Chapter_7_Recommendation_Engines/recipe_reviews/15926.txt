It is not authentic until you add black and white pudding as well as baked beans (which I really hate on my breakfast to be honest). This is more an "Irish American breakfast". Not bad but not Irish. I went to culinary school in Ireland and really....it NEEDS black and white pudding.

Very authetic and quite similar to breakfast I once had in an Irish bed n'breakfast.  Since I could not find back or Irish bacon as it is sometimes called, I used meaty slices of ham.  To help keep the eggs whole and seperate, I fried the tomatoes and mushrooms in a seperate frying pan to make things easier. I garnished the plates with shredded good-quality Irish cheddar.

I haven't made this but spent quite some time in ireland and this lacks too many items to be an irish breakfast.  black (blood pudding) and white pudding, eggs, grilled tomato.  it's a good start.

For a truely authentic experience you'd need to find some black or white pudding, and for a truely magnificent hangover cure add baked beans and lashings of tea and toast.

It's missing some very vital ingredients.Where's the sausage,beans(baked) and black pudding?Whenever we have a big night out,the next morning we will head to our local cafe here in Dublin for a big fry up and it always has these things along with the bacon ,eggs etc.That's a true Irish fry up!

What an awesome meal.  My husband & I had it for dinner and we love it.  It's unique in that it includes veggies, which American breakfasts almost never do.  Quick & easy too!

My husband and I thought this was good with the Irresistable Irish Soda Bread.  The sweet and moistness of the bread went well with the rest of the breakfast.  It was fast and easy.  I also stacked the bacon, bread, tomato, and egg on top of each other so I could taste everything in one bite.  I couldn't fit the mushrooms on top but I still had them on the side and with every bite. Yum!

I'm giving it a two because of the fried eggs but the veggies with it were bad.  Next time we'll have some hash browns or something.

Beautifully laid out picture - very classical. Trying to recreate an Irish breakfast in North America is not without it's challenges. Black and White pudding is not available in many locations. American breakfast links are of a different consistency to Irish sausages, links are more rubbery for a start and have a different flavour. Back bacon is again almost impossible to find, since 'streaky' bacon seems to be the only sort available and again, this is almost exclusively 'smoked' - it seems brine, or dry salt cured bacon has never been heard of? I guess Canadian bacon makes somewhat of a substitute. Also, plain white or brown soda bread, or wheaten bread would be traditionally served with breakfast, since fruited bread is considered more of a dessert. In this breakfast, pictured above, I would agree with the fried tomato, mushrooms and the eggs. As other reviewers have mentioned, what are called baked beans in Ireland, most closely resembling pork and beans in the US, would be another addition to the plate. An Americanism that I believe does work well with an Irish breakfast is loosely grated fried potato, ie hash browns. Of course, if one made all of these additions, it would indeed be a mammoth breakfast and probably overload your system for the day!

A traditional Irish breakfast always includes beans, which are similar to US baked beans, but not as sweet. It should also include black sausage, and possibly white sausage.

I had to use thick sliced bacon.
  As an Irish man, ( woman), it brought me back to the old days.

This was a hit, made it two days in a row as I had two sets of house guests celebrating St. Patrick's Day.  I made the Irresistible Irish Soda bread from this site to go with it. I kept it wrapped in the fridge and it is still tasty a week later.

Make sure you buy thick cut good quality bacon, even if you hand cut the bacon. Plus you can freshen this up by using fresh cut tomatoes versus canned. Toasting the Irish bread adds a nice crisp to the bread. A breakfast like this is a great way to start your day because it keeps you from snacking.

I substituted grilled haloumi cheese for the bacon.  I almost over cooked the tomato; it was a little mushy for my tastes.
