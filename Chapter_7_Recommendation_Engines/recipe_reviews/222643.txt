We really enjoyed this. I prepared it in advance, and it kept well overnight.

I followed the recipe exact, only leaving out the thyme. My whole family INHALED these. Seriously. They were gone in ten minutes. All six of them. Next time, I will know to double the recipe and maybe then there will be leftovers.

These were good. The Alfredo sauce didn't add the flavor that I thought it would. Next time. I'll add more.  I also added chopped broccoli florets. Kids liked these.

These were gone in minutes, everyone loves them. If I would change anything it might be to hold back a little on the Alfredo sauce so it would be a little less runny but otherwise a great side dish to go with anything.
