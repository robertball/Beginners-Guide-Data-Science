Thanks for posting, I usually cook and mash on the stove but thought I could try the same thing in my slow cooker.  Never tried the apple juice but glad I did.  This turned out perfect.

I like the ease and simplicity of this recipe but it was too sweet for me. Also, the squash remained as cubes after 8 hours in the slow cooker, but it only takes about 5 minutes to mash it to a smooth consistency.

This recipe is so easy and it smells like fall when it is cooking! I did make a few alterations to the recipe though. I added cubed sweet potato, omitted the butter (but did spray the pot with Pam), and added pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. I did not have any, but I think apple cider in place of the apple juice would be even better! Definitely will be a fall staple!

Very simple recipe, but a touch sweet for me. I didn't mash the squash up. I will try that next time. Followed recipe as written and cooked for 7 hours on low.

Really sweet, like too sweet.  But it is easy.  You could cut down on the sweetness but cutting out the brown sugar or using water instead of apple juice.  The apple juice gave it a weird flavor, although it could be because I used "apple cocktail" which apparently is only 20% real juice.

I made with orange juice instead of apple juice, and did not use any sugar. It was plenty sweet just from the natural sugar of the squash and juice. I think I would have had to throw it out if I had added sugar, due to excessive sweetness. But without the sugar it was delicious. So easy too!
