Only exception to following this recipe to the letter was using diced water chestnuts (what I had on hand) instead of sliced, and that would only impact presentation, not flavor.  The veggie combination is tasty, it was just the dressing that we didn’t care for.  The paprika, dry mustard, and soy sauce just didn’t complement each other IMO, but I wanted to give it a try.  I will say that I thought the addition of the optional mayonnaise did help, but the dressing totally liquified in a very short period of time...definitely not pretty.  I hate to give such a bad review being the first reviewer, and I do not want to discourage anybody from trying this recipe.  We all have different tastes, and what tastes good to one may not taste the same to another.  Sorry, but I won’t be making this one again.

I liked it, but my family thought it was spicy, so if I make it again, I will leave out the paprika.  Also, it makes a LOT, so I was left eating it for about 4 meals after my family didn't want it.  I could make it again, but halve the recipe, assuming I'll be the only one to eat it.

I used a combination of lemon greek yogurt and mayo and subbed rice wine vinegar for the red.  We also found the paprika and mustard strange with the other asian flavors.  I would recommend rough chopping the chestnuts to a size similar to the peas just for ease of eating.
