I cut this recipe back to 10 servings. I did change the egg amount--it was asking for an egg and a half, what I did was omit the half and up the applesauce to an additional quarter cup. Everything else I kept exactly the same. I did make muffins out of this recipe. I got 12 biggish muffins out of this, not ten. They baked up nicely and are very moist and on point for sweetness. For my husband and I, I don't know that we liked the cocoa powder in this recipe (the kids inhaled it, between the both of them they ate FIVE muffins) but really that's not a deal breaker. I think it would be just as good without, just add an additional 2 tablespoons of flour and omit the cocoa powder next time. But, that's really a personal preferance, not reflective of the recipe. The zucchini bread with the cinnamon chips is a winning combination. VERY good. NOTE: I used Hershey's cinnamon baking chips in this recipe.

I was looking for a different kind of breakfast quick bread and this was terrific. The amount of cocoa is just enough to give it a light chocolate flavor. The zucchini, whole wheat flour and applesauce make it a healthier alternative. The first time I made it, I was not able to find cinnamon baking chips so I used chocolate chips. I finally found  the cinnamon chips at another store. It was great both ways. This got rave reviews from my family! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Angelina!

My whole family loves this recipe!
I didn't know where to find the cinnamon chips so substituted them for regular chocolate chips. I'm looking forward to trying it exactly as written. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe Angelina!

Great recipe, might be my new favorite.  I love that it uses applesauce and whole wheat flour and you wouldn't even know it!  I made 24 muffins and baked around 13-15 minutes and they came out well.

Love that this bread is a little more healthier than the usual zucchini bread with oil. I had chunky applesauce and it worked fine. The bits of apple were good. The cocoa was nice addition. Baked up right on time. I added mini chocolate chips to one loaf and kept one plain. Load cut into slices nicely which is important to me. And the loaf was moist.

This is my new favorite recipe.  I've made it 3x-  once as written, once without the cocoa and with chocolate chips and once I just used the base measurements and substituted bananas and walnuts.  I was really looking for a recipe that used whole wheat flour and no oil.  This recipe provides a great base for any combo of veggies( carrot, zucchini) and chips or nuts.  Tastes great and moist without the oil.
