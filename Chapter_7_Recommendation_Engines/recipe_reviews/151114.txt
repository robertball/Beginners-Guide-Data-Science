This was an unusual taste combination salad. The dressing didnt want to incorporate very well with the bulgur. It made alot, but leftovers are not great as the lettuce is wilted. So its good for a pot-luck or big gathering. I would try it again.

This is definitely a keeper!!!  The array of flavors are magnificent.  The only thing that I had to omit was Cilantro, but not by my choice.  I love it, my husband does not.  But it really didn't matter because it was still great.  Even my children liked it.  This recipe will make it into the schedule probably every other week. Thanks!

Really light and yummy. I've been looking for ways to get more whole grains into my family members and this did the trick. My dad called it "vulgar wheat" before he tried it but was singing a different tune by the end of it. Super easy to make. The dressing was a little sweet but paired really well with a more savory entre. Next time I will cut down the sweet a little bit. Thanks a lot for this new summer favorite!

I have been making this salad for about 2 years now and EVERYBODY loves it. I omit the romaine and add 2 huge buches of both cilantro and parsley. I also add red peppers and some carrot. It keeps well in the fridge all week, Make This Salad, you will not be sorry.

I think the basic recipe is very good.   I didn't have the exact ingredients and I substituted for the cheese and lettuce.  The dressing was very sweet, in our opinion, so that's something for me to fiddle with.   Conceptually, though, this recipe is going in the Keeper file.   Thank you for sharing!

The dressing for this bulgur salad is awesome!  Since I didn't have dates, romaine, or green onions, I improvised and used a couple stalks of celery diced and a few cups of fresh spinach chopped.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of blackberries chopped.  Turned out fantastic.

Whoa!  Keeper Alert!  Just a couple of notes.  First - for the Bulgur, bring the water to a boil in a small sauce pan, add the bulgur and stir, cover and turn off the heat & let sit for 30 minutes.  Make the dressing exactly as directed - it is really good!  I used green Granny Smith apples.  In addition to the dates I added some dried cranberries.  (other dried fruit would be really good too.)  Once the bulgur is done and slightly cool, mix a little of the dressing into the bulgur and lightly toss.  I only used about 1/4 cup sliced almonds and a couple of slices of Munster cheese.   What a great combination of flavors!  Thanks for sharing GG.

This is very similar to a salad that used to be on the menu at Hopkins Eatery in Tallahassee. They took it off, but now I can fix it (or something very close), whenever I want!

I loved this  salad.  I did use dried cranberries  and low fat sour cream that I had on hand in place of the dates and yogurt.  I did not add the cheese.  
I think you could make many variations of this recipe and they will all be delicious.  A great lunch and easy to put together.

I wanted to make something with cracked wheat that wasn't tabbouleh and would not make me wish I had made tabbouleh instead.  And this was very attractive.  I followed cooks&books advice and left out the lettuce and added extra cilantro and parsley.  This is really good and really different and I think all of the flavors come together well.  DH was looking forward to this in his lunch today.
