Really good!  I think that I'll cut the potatoes a bit thinner next time.  At 1 inch thick, they seemed a bit undercooked.  Still tasted great though!

Very good! The taste was perfect, original and filling. I did follow the advice of the other reviewer and sliced the potatoes much thinner than the one inch thickness that the recipe called for. Turned out to be cooked all the way through and delicious. The only other thing I did different was to have added a little bit more cheese, considering I had some extra (about a cup extra), but it turned out to be nice and cheesy, gooey and delicious. I made this dish to compliment a ham that I had made and it served extremely well. Very good dish! Would definitely make again and in the future.

I altered the recipe so that I could make these a day ahead. First I peeled the potatoes (10 of them),then I put them through the food processor and sliced them into 1/8 inch thick slices. Then I sautéed them in butter (ended up using 3 pans so as not to overcrowd the potatoes each pan had a quarter cup of butter) and I sprinkled them with a little kosher salt. Sauteed them for about 10 minutes until just tender,then I drained the butter out of each pan into a large bowl. To this I added the cream of chicken and the sour cream. Then I folded in 1 bunch of sliced chives and 2 cups shredded cheddar and 1 cup shredded emmenthaler. Then I layered three layers of potatoes,starting with the sauce on the bottom and ending with the sauce on top. I stuck it in the fridge till the next day. Next day melted the 1/4 cup butter and put 3 cups corn flakes in a gallon ziplock bag and crushed them with a marble rolling pin. Poured the melted butter in the bag once the butter cooled a little and mixed it up in the bag. Poured the mixture onto the potatoes. Baked at 350 for 45 min. Half of the time it was covered in foil and the other half of the time it was uncovered. I wish I had put some white pepper in this but I forgot. This was super good but should have cooked even longer since a few of the potatoes were a little underdone. It made a lot of dirty dishes for one side dish but it was very decadent and special and it helped to make it a day ahead.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It's a true classic Mormon Utah dish!  My whole family loved this recipe...even my 17-month old couldn't get enough of it!  I've been looking everywhere for a dish like this that doesn't use fake or frozen potatoes...I wanted real potatoes and this is perfect!  I added some salt and pepper to make it taste even better!

I have made these potatoes twice now and they are a HIT!  The only thing that I did differently was substituted Panko breadcrumbs for corn flakes (didn't have any), and the second time I adjusted the ingredients to make a smaller pan (there are only 2 of us here).  I would suggest, as some of the others have, cutting the potatoes as thin as you can to make sure that get cooked all the way through...overall 5 stars!

Fabulous! I thin sliced the potatoes first then parboiled or around 10 minutes until the potatoes were beginning to soften but could still be handled for layering. Use green chili dip instead of sour cream! Takes about an hour to cook. YUMMM!!!

I've made this several times and have found the addition of a layer of sauteed onions takes this to a different, delicious level. I usually put the onions on the bottom, just after the first layer of potatoes. Also, I have tried this with every sort of cheese and if you use Parmesan, it has a bit more of a sophisticated flavor. To make it vegetarian friendly, I use cream of mushroom soup.

Made it exactly as written except I didn't parboil the potatoes. Instead, I used a mandolin to slice them thin and cooked the dish for 1 hr (covered for the first half). Super yummy.

This turned out so well that my family (with many food restrictions) immediately added it to the "make it again" list! I sliced the potatoes on a mandolin slicer, about 1/4 inch thick. I didn't precook the potatoes, just cooked it for a bit longer and it was magnificent!

If you make the Mormon funeral potatoes, this was just as good, but much easier to make. I used more potatoes and sliced them much thinner. They came out perfectly. They were the hit of the meal. I made a double batch for a big family gathering and that was the only thing that was completely eaten. Everyone raved about them. Thank you for a great recipe.

Simply delicious!  I added 2 cups of cubed ham and it was fantastic!  What a wonderful thing to come home to after a long day at work.  Kids and hubby loved it too.

This was amazing! I had only 1 can of cr. chicken and added 1 can of cr. mushroom. Before the cornflake layer I added a thin layer of shredded cheese. Everyone loved it especially the teenagers!

I will definitely make these potatoes again. Everyone at our Easter Dinner asked for the recipe. I did slice the potatoes about a quarter inch instead of an inch as the recipe called for.

I cooked the (Idaho) potatoes a bit too long and sliced them in my food processor so ended up with sort-of-mashed potatoes as layers in the casserole but it didn't matter ~ they were THE BEST!  Even better the next day!
Next time I made half a batch and cut the potatoes about 1/4 inch thick and baked them about an hour.  DELICIOUS!

This was incredible! I made it as one of the side dishes to go with my Easter ham. The only changes I made (after reading the other reviews) was that I cubed the cooked potatoes in 1 inch squares instead of slices.I boiled 8 medium potatoes but only had room for 5 in my 9 x 13 dish. I also used  2 1/2 cups of corn flakes to have enough to cover the top. It got rave reviews from the whole family, so it's going to be a part of our Easter dinner tradition from now on. It's different enough from scalloped potatoes that I can still make scalloped potatoes with the ham leftovers and not feel I've been eating the same dish for days.

I’ve made this recipe on a few occasions. I’ve tweaked it a bit based on ingredients on hand and, like others, slice my potatoes finer. I use russet potatoes and always almost cook them whole in the microwave beforehand, skin and all.  It’s a great recipe and always a hit! Thank you for sharing!

This is the best scalloped potato recipe I have ever tasted. The combination of the sour cream, cream of chicken soup and corn flakes on top makes it heavenly. I made it for a New Years Eve gourmet dinner party and it was s big hit.

My whole family really liked this dish. The only thing I would do differently next time would be cut the potatoes thinner.  I doubled the cooking time and still thought the potatoes where slightly undercooked. With that said, I will definitely be making this over and over!

Made it twice. As you assemble it, lightly salt and pepper the potatoes. They need it. You could add salt to your cheese mixture but you might over do it. Next year it gets bacon fried and crumbled on the layers!

Russet potatoes come in such a wide range of sizes, saying 8 potatoes will get you no uniformity in the recipe.  I halved the recipe and used 4 medium sized potatoes.  I only had enough potatoes to make one layer in the 9x9" pan.  Third, why are we cutting in such large pieces?  Cutting them so large makes for awkward serving.  I ended up having to mash the potato and sauce together on my plate in order to eat it all together.  Fourth, the amount of butter in the sauce is too much.  There is a huge grease slick in the pan.  I did use unsalted butter and therefore my potatoes needed salt and pepper.  It was very bland and greasy before.  I had to add some dried minced onion because I didn't have enough green onions.  I also used Panko bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.  I was happy to try the recipe and give it a "face" but I won't be making it again.

Very good recipe! I sliced mine to just less than 1/2" thick.  (I liked that, but my girls wished they were thinner, yet.)  I didn't add the crust.  But, both my husband & I agreed that the only thing that would make it better would be a topping...go figure.  I did't have hardly any sour cream but had some left over heavy cream so I used that.  For a girl that loves sour cream and couldn't use it, you couldn't have told that something was missing.  Definately making again.

Super easy - family loved it!

I meant to halve the recipe and accidentally put a full portion of butter in the mix...tried to 'correct' my mistake by being generous with the sour cream and cheese as well...ended up with a very creamy scalloped potatoes which my husband loved!  Will make again!

I thought this recipe was good. We heated up the leftovers the next day and mashed it up and added some extra cheese and it was even better than the night before.  I will continue searching for the perfect recipe.

My family ate it all up, but the potatoes did not cook all the way.  I will add an additional 30 min next time to see if it cooks all the way. Great if you like crunchy potato.

Very yummy! I cut the potatoes thinner like others suggested but still some of the potatoes were a little firm, so next time I will cook it for an hour instead. I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom instead of a cream of chicken. It turned out great....could hardly get the leftovers to the fridge without eating them myself!

yes a classic dish,I would give it a 3 1/2 for taste and a 4 because of ease. But I have had better maybe since I live in Utah so I continue my search for "the best Mormon potatoes" recipe. I personally have a scalloped potato recipe that is divine... but it takes a while since its from scratch and not cans.

When you want a stick to your ribs, guilty pleasure kind of  side dish, this one fits the bill. 
 I used panko crumbs instead of corn flakes .

I did as everyone recommended in other reviews and sliced the potatoes super thin (bless the Salad Shooter inventor!). I thought, these are so thin, I won't need to parboil the potatoes, they'll cook in the sauce in the oven. But, I was wrong. Even after an hour in the oven, the outer potatoes did, the inner ones did not. The sauce, however, was fantastic! Next time, I'm either going to do as the recipe suggests and parboil the potatoes, or increase the cook time. We're the potatoes cooked through, it would have been a home run.

I’m  taking a star off because I’ve made theee three years in a row and the potatoes are never done. I follow the instructions exactly as stated, I cut the potatoes really really thin and they’re still hard. 
Honestly, the only thing that worked for us was putting the temperature on 375 for an hour. 350 for 45 minutes isn’t going to cut it.

Very good! I made two pans of these potatoes. For one pan, I added one large jalapeño diced and substituted Monterey Jack cheese for the cheddar cheese. I added the diced jalapeños to the first two layers only. Delicious!! The second pan I made like the original recipe. Yummy either way.

Easy and delicious.  For a slightly healthier version substitute plain yogurt instead of sour cream - tastes just as good to me!

I froze half of this for later, and it was just as good from the freezer. I did slice the potatoes thinner-maybe an eighth- inch thick. Very good!

Very good and my family loved it.  Similar to a local dish made with frozen hash browns.  The only thing I will change next time is add more potatoes.  I think the ones I used were too small and the ratio of sauce to potato was a little off.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Enjoyed by all, I made a huge batch and 8/10 were gone.  I did cut my potatoes a 1/2 inch, I knew that would work better.  Loved the corn flakes.  Next time- I'll try Large diced, should scoop and serve better.. No lie - Loved it.  Oh I added packaged sliced deli ham to leftovers...better then awesome.

I made a 1/2 batch last night to see how it would taste and it was gone in a flash - and there're only two of us. My husband is thinking of variations such as adding crisp bacon, ham, ground beef, or adding some cream and making it into the best potato soup ever. We're making a double batch now to take to the Masonic Lodge tonight where my husband will receive his 50-year pin! Everything is good all around! I did NOT change a thing other than follow the suggestions of cutting the potatoes thinner. We loved it.

bland. I figured with all that cheese, sour cream, butter and soup mix this couldn't miss, but it was a dud. It was bland and uninteresting and I am surprised by the good reviews. If you are going to splurge on the calories make something with more flavor.

Made this recipe for my daughter to take to a "friendsgiving" potluck. She texted to say everyone loved it! I looked at reviews and ended up using 4 cups of cheddar cheese and 3 cups of corn flakes. I also did not boil the potatoes, but peeled and used a mandolin slicer to slice them to about 1/8 inch. I also baked  the dish for 45 minutes covered and 45 uncovered. Very easy and apparently delicious.

After cooling the boiled potatoes, I used a box grater and grate the potatoes.  It's much easier and the potatoes are sure to get cooked through.  Very good recipe.  I added some garlic salt and extra cheese.

My family is GF so I needed to make my own cream of chicken. I accomplished this by mixing water, milk, chicken bouillon, gf flour, garlic powder, and pepper in a small saucepan and cooked until thick. 
I also cooked my potatoes in my pressure cooker for one minute after I ran them through a food processor first to thinly slice them. I followed this recipe exactly except for adding canned cream of chicken and chives because I had none.
my family loved it! it also makes a ton!! I'll have a side dish for tonight supper which is less work for me. Thanks for the recipe.

The perfect dish for the occasion, I really did not change one item and the completed dish was excellent. This one will be put in rotation to be sure.
