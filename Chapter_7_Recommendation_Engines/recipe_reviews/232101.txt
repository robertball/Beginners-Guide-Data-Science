I rushed in after being out late, removed some chicken from the frig, chopped it up, and threw it in a skillet with BBQ sauce to heat it up. I located this 5 Minute Slaw in my recipe box and whipped it up. Then as I finished reading the recipe, I realized I was supposed to let it marinate 4-6 hours. Hmmm, not 5 minutes after all! No time for refrigerating! And that was my fault for not reading the recipe. Now, for what I thought of it. I didn't like it at all when I tasted it by itself. I think I prefer regular vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. But I thought it was ok when put on the BBQ sandwich. Somehow, the BBQ sauce and chicken tempered the flavor of the red wine vinegar in the coleslaw. So, not a total loss, but I won't fix it again.

I had some food processor shredded cabbage and carrots from another recipe in the fridge, so this was a good way to use it.  This is a fantastic recipe for anybody watching calories, fat and carbs; there's no oil or mayo. The only change I made was using Truvia instead of sugar.   I've always used celery seed in cole slaw (either vinegar or mayo-based), but I've not used red wine vinegar before.  It was much mellower (is that a word?) than cider vinegar, and this was a success.

I'm going to try it again with much less salt. I think it will be a fine recipe then.

Have looked for a long time for a slaw recipe that would come close to my mother-in-lawâ€™s (no oil or mayonnaise!). Made this slaw for my husband and he gives it high praise!  Read previous reviews and also recommend using less salt.
