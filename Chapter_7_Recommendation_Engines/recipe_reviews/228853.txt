I was doing something like this before but I would freeze the whole container of yogurt and then scoop it out into the blender and add my frozen fruit. The muffin tin idea is money. That will make things a lot smoother (because scooping the yogurt out is a pain).

I have been portioning my fruit for my morning smoothies for a long time now. I add all the same things as this recipe, except I add whey protein powder also. To save a step, b4 freezing, you can just add the yogurt to the bag of fruit instead of getting the muffin tin dirty, I buy the liter size of Greek yogurt and portion it out. It is alot thicker and richer than regular yogurt.

This is a great idea.  You can throw anything you want into the freezer bag and have it ready for the blender.   Or just make it simple like frozen yogurt, frozen strawberries and one fresh apple.  Tried that today, it was excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent concept! I love speeding things along in the mornings. Here is another hint to add to your idea. Many canning jars have openings that are the same as the bottom of a blender pitcher. Portion your ingredients into single serve portions, and freeze in pint sized jars (lids on, but not "canned") In the morning, just take the lid off a jar, replace with the blender base/blades, invert and put on the blender. Push the button and do your thing! This way, if you don't need 4 servings, you can make single servings and drink right out of the jar. We use canning jars as glasses all the time. Plus, you can freeze different combinations of fruit for your smoothies, to keep everyone supplied with their favorite tastes. Oh, and I also add a little milk before blending, just to smooth it up a little. If you don't have room for jars in your freezer, go ahead and baggie up single serve portions as instructed in the recipe, then blend in a canning jar. No cleaning the blender pitcher!

I tried this, the yogurt was too frozen so when i tried to blend it I had to wait almost 3 hours for it to thaw enough that the blender actually blended something. Then I had to add some juice for some liquid. After I finally got it blended it needed something to sweeten it as the taste was so berry without sugar. I usually eat my berries plain so that didn't bother me so much.  Will make the others with modifications, I have 5 more bags.

This was perfect! My daughter is lactose intolerant so I used Yoplait's lactose free yogurt and it was great.  I'm freezing the yogurt in silicone muffin cups so it'll just pop right out for me.

I used Greek Yogurt and it just would not blend.  It was frozen hard as a rock.  I finally just left the bag with all the ingredients out until it thawed and then everything blended fine.  Delicious!  But I'm disappointed I can't use it immediately when I take it  from the freezer.  Maybe if I used another type of yogurt it would blend easier frozen.

This makes mornings so easy!  I froze Greek yogurt in mini muffin cups and found that I need to add a bit of liquid when I threw it all in the blender, so I added about 2 oz. pineapple juice and a good sized banana chunk when I mixed it all up.  Delicious, and makes mornings so much easier!  Thanks for the great idea!
