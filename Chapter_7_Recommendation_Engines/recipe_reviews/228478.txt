I butterflied the chicken breast and followed the recipe exactly. As I don't eat meat, I made chicken for my Dad and tilapia for myself, which was also quite good. My Dad loved the chicken. Said it was juicy and very flavorful. My photo doesn't do the bright colors justice. I have seen this recipe without the spinach and will try it that way next time. I will also make a balsamic reduction to create a more intense flavor and prettier presentation. But overall this was a great recipe and pretty easy to make. It would make a great open face sandwich!!

I liked this.  I used garden tomatoes which definitely enhanced the flavor. I don't think I would make this if I only had flavorless hothouse tomatoes.  I did add a little Italian Seasoning to the chicken before I browned it for another layer of flavor.

Great base recipe. I modified it a bit to add more veggies: lightly browned on stove top in 2T olive oil, the boneless/skinless chicken breast cut into tenders, coated in Italian dry seasoning/garlic powder/ Salt&pepper, then removed from pan. Added to the pan and suteed lightly [not soft, but not crisp] sliced can mushrooms, 1/2 sliced green zucchini, a sliced green and red pepper, and half a small red onion.  I put veggies in oven- safe baking dish, sprayed with Pam, then topped with chicken, then sauteed spinach with minced jarred garlic,  a layer of Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and topped with  tomato slices and then balsamic vinegar.  Baked uncovered in 425 degree oven for 35 minutes. When done, I again lightly topped with more Moz. and some Parm. cheeses [to taste] and served over whole wheat pasta. Absolutely delightful! Enough for my dear husband and I to have leftovers for lunch at work the next day.

Only change I made was to sprinkle with chopped basil before placing in the oven.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a huge success. Oh, I did use Roma tomatoes instead of the beefsteaks.  I like Romas better.  This makes a terrific winter rendition of Caprese.

This was absolutely delicious! I tweaked it just a bit. I added a few red pepper flakes to the spinach and when it was wilted, I removed it from the pan. Then I put in a fresh diced tomato and just sauteed it until it softened up, and then removed that from the pan. I then added a bit more olive oil and cooked the chicken as instructed. I then put the spinach, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on the chicken(I used the small balls cut in half because the store didn't have the larger) and cooked it as instructed.  I'm not a huge balsamic fan so I omitted that. My husband said it was restaurant worthy!! Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

It has been a hit! I've made it on four occasions in the last month. The only change I've made is to make a balsamic glaze so the flavor sticks around instead of running right off the chicken.

We liked it.  Next time I am going to add more garlic and some lime juice for added flavor.

I followed the directions exactly and while it tasted wonderful, the bake time was at least 30 minutes (double what the recipe calls for).  Will make again.

Soooo good and easy!  I used roma tomatoes and chopped them up before putting them on the chicken.  I also could not find buffalo mozzarella, so used a block of mozarella and sliced it up.  Tasty!

This was very easy and very good - I used two large chicken breasts and butterflied them in half, cooking in the skillet with some Italian seasoning.  I also cooked the sliced tomatoes (I used Roma) in the skilled a bit before putting together and in the oven.  I only had about a cup of spinach but more would be awesome, too.  And I drizzled about 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar over the whole thing and baked about 20 minutes.  Delicious!

Followed instructions...maybe we just don't care for caprese chicken ?? I really wanted to love it considering I had everything in the fridge. Oh well, still rating it high because it was easy and convenient to put together.

The  cheese all totally melted before it came out of the oven so there was very little chees left on the chicken.  Need to put the cheese on about 5 minutes before taking the chicken out of the oven.

Really good! Use garden fresh tomatoes and a balsamic reduction on top. Then a sprinkle of fresh basil. Yum!
