It was good and flavorful. I used diced onions instead of minced. I also didn't cook the tomatoes as long as it said and cut back on the sugar and it tasted fine. The tomatoes were tender and the flavor came out. I used more bourbon (why not ?) for extra flavor. I didn't taste bourbon in the finished dish, but my wife did. We'll make this again.

It came out great but I did have to make some substitutions. I switched the whiskey for vermouth( didn't have whiskey) but other than that it came out amazing!

I was rather disappointed.  I used less sugar than stated, but I found it rather sickly sweet.  I couldn't finish it.  I am going to make it again, but with very little sugar.  I never add rum, cognac, whisky to a recipe without flambeing it.  It tastes so much better.

These were very good pork chops! I have basically two recipes for pork chops that my husband doesn't complain that they are dry. I decided to try these on him, and he was very happy! I did not change a thing except that I didn't have grape tomatoes only Roma, so I quartered them and as they softened I flattened them. I also sprinkled pork seasoning on the chops before cooking. I think the bourbon adds a very nice flavor to them. Thanks so much for sharing Nattygirl, will definitely be making again.

Yummy. This is my recipe, and I just made it again. It turned out so well. This time I used tenderloin pork chops. It isn't that much work to brown onions and tomatoes separately. I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. It came out really good! My husband loves this dish.
