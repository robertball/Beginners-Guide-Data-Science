This is awesome...my husband and I really enjoyed this dish!!  Only changes were less cilantro in the salsa, and i added green onions and red bell peppers.  I cooked the chicken in a frying pan which i think worked great!  I loved how colourful the salsas was!!  YUM!!!

This chicken had a great flavor. I marinated the chicken longer than intended,overnight and then through the next day, and it was great. My only complaint was that I felt like the pineapple salsa called for too much cilantro. I used a couple of tablespoons and that was plenty, as it has such a strong taste. Served this with a caribbean rice mix and it was a great tropical flavored dish.

Easy, delicious marinated grilled chicken.  I only had 1-2 hours to marinate the chicken, and it still came out delicious.  Interesting side note, the chicken tastes good on it's own, the salsa tastes good (but it's not the kind of salsa to eat on it's own as a side, it's meant to be a topping on the chicken). But when you take a bite of the chicken topped with salsa together....YUM!  Everyone in the family, including the cilantro-hater, LOVED this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  The sauce makes the chicken. I used olive oil instead of sesame oil and vegetable oil and served over a bed of jasmine rice. HIGHLY recommend

This dish was simple to make and very tasty.  The salsa was awesome.  I didn't add as much cilantro.  Very nice dish, will definately make again.

Very good and different.  My boyfriend liked it a lot.  I cut down on the cilantro... about by half and that was just right-and I'm a big cilantro fan.  The chicken came out VERY tender and moist.  Mmmm!

I just cooked this last night for my husband and I.  It was delicious. I followed advice from former reviews: used more Pineapple (approx. 12 ounces) and less Sesame Oil (only 3 tspns), but the same amount of cilantro and it came out WONDERFUL!  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and cooked it on top of the stove which was just fine.  The pineapple salsa is so delicious, you want to smother each bite of chicken with the pineapple salsa. I also cooked Spanish rice and that complimented each bite even more. It was truly delicious. I would highly recommend a rice side with this dish.  If I were to change anything, I would make more pineapple salsa, atleast 3 servings (for dinner for two). I can't wait to make it again!

It was pretty good, but I had to make a few changes.  First, I cut back dramatically on the oils in the marinade...down to about 1/8 cup on the canola oil and 1 Tbsp on the sesame oil (it can have an overpowering taste). I used this marinade on pork tenderloin and marinated it only for an hour (so the acid of the pineapple juice wouldn't ruin the tender pork).  Then the salsa needed something, so I added 1 Tbsp of corn syrup (not so sweet fresh pineapple) and some red pepper flakes. Maybe next time some mango or something added to the pineapple.  The marinade was very tasty.  Will also use this for chicken next time.

We loved this!  It looks beautiful, like restaurant food.  I cooked my chicken breasts on the foreman grill, and we added a half of a seeded jalapeno to the salsa which was great.  The salsa really compliments the chicken.  I read the reviews and put in less cilantro, and my husband still said it was too overpowering, and we like cilantro.  So thats the only tweak I will make.

I really don't like sesame seed. Even after reading the reviews that said the recipe calls for too much sesame seed oil, I decided to be brave. I wanted to see how the recipe was supposed to taste first. To my surprise, it was exquisite - no overwhelming flavors at all. Even my grandfather, who doesn't seem to like anything anymore, devoured this! If I was to change anything, I think it would be to add a bit more ginger and make extra pineapple salsa - yummy!!

I made this recipe for my girlfriends for one of our girl nights and they couldn't believe how great it was!  I cooked it on the stove instead of in a grill and they still raved! I'm making it again for my parents tonight and expect rave reviews again! 

So easy and so good = and A+ in my books!

Tastes great and easy to make. Instead of grilling, I cooked it in a frying pan with a bit of oil and served it with white rice. A hit with my husband and 3 kids!

Personally, I loved it.  I agree that you can make do with a lot less sesame oil, though.  The salsa was very interesting and complemented the saltiness of the chicken very nicely, but my husband didn't like it at all.  "Too weird", he said.

Yum . . . This was so good.  I marinaded the chicken for two hours, and it turned out fine.  I also baked this in the oven at 350 for 30 min instead of grilling it. Searved over rice, with the  salsa over the top of it all. I really liked the flavor of the salsa over the rice.  A keeper.

This was a pretty good chicken dish.  The marinade is wonderful and the salsa perfectly complements the flavor of the chicken.   Beware of using too much cilantro, though...  it's strong stuff after it sits for a bit! 
Not sure if I'll make it again, but it nice to have something different!

This is honestly the best chicken recipe I have ever made at home. Moist, flavorful, delish!

The only thing I did differently was using crushed pineapple instead but that was because I bought the wrong type on accident. In the end, I liked it better because you had a nice coating of salsa on each bite of chicken.

The flavors worked really well together and my 7 year old cleaned his plate then asked for more!

The chicken was good on its own, and the salsa was okay, but I usually love meat with fruit salsa. This salsa just didn't do it for me. The flavors didn't come together well.

We made this last night and loved it.  We only made a few minor changes.  First, we only put one tablespoon of sesame oil. (we changed the serving size to 4)  Previous experience has taught us that sesame oil is very overpowering.  It's great, but a little goes a LONG way.  We also only used  about 2 tablespoons of cilantro - and we love cilantro.  I made the full 6 servings of pineapple salsa.  From reading the reviews, it seems like others are leaving out the picante salsa.  My husband was very leary of using a Mexican salsa with an Asian type dish, so he put his on the side.  It wouldn't have been as wonderful without the salsa.  Now we put the picante on the chicken and the pineapple on top of that.  It's a great combination of sweet and spicy.  We LOVED this dish.  Having the leftovers tonight...  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

I loved the chicken nd cooked it in the broiler, which it still came out juicy. I agree that some very minor adjustments will have to be made as there was a salty after tase from the soy sauce. Also I want to try to mix it up with the salsa a bit.I definitely loved it over all, and will be trying this again in the future

I thought this was a great mix of flavors--especially the cilantro pineapple salsa.  My boyfriend generally doesn't like fruit with chicken but he was a fan of this recipe.

This was absolutely fantastic! I made it the night before, so that it could marinate for almost 24 hours, before cooking. The only thing I may change the next time I make this, is to add more pinapple to the salsa.

The marinade was tasty but needs alot less sesame oil - a few teaspoons at most.  The pineapple salsa didn't meld well - the flavors tasted separate, even after a few hours in the frig.  Perhaps the salsa would taste better with fresh pineapple...

WONDERFUL. I didn't think I liked pineapple with chicken but my boyfriend convinced me to make it. It was so moist and flavorful. We had caribbean rice on the side like someone suggested and that was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent. Made it for a party and another guy who brought his "famous" ribs was clearly upset as he had been trumped. The leftovers i chopped and used as filling in steamed buns.

We enjoyed this one!  I marinated it most of the day and made the salsa in the afternoon, adding a minced jalapeno, which was a nice and colorful addition.  I also omitted the cilantro, because I didn’t have any.  I didn’t refrigerate it, but left it at room temperature, because I'm not fond of cold salsa on my hot chicken.  I would definitely make this again.  It was flavorful and presented well.  I’d love to try it with fresh pineapple sometime.

Loved this!  When I make it next time, I will double the salsa.  I used sweet onion instead of red, I added about 1/4 c. diced red bell pepper and about 2 Tbs. minced fresh jalapeno, along with a pinch of sea salt.  The marinade is quite tasty, too, though I chose to omit the vegetable oil and half the black pepper.  Yummy dish, served with steamed broccoli.

A wonderful recipe!  Family favorite.  The recipe calls for way too much silantro (I use 1/8 of a cup), but other than that, it's perfect!
