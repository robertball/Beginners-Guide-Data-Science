I made some changes to this recipes by I using the shrimp on bread with pesto idea, but I deep fried my already peeled and deveined shrimp using the "Classic Fish and Chips" recipe on this website. Then I tossed the deep fried shrimp in pesto sauce, served it on slices of a french baguette, and it was great. A simple idea, but it doesn't get any better. So delicious. Five stars.

Loved this. I lightly floured and seasoned the shrimp then cooked them for 1 minute per side in very hot olive oil.  Also spread the pesto on the bread rather than tossing the shrimp and omitted the butter.  A very simple but tasty meal.

Great kick to shrimp pesto! I followed the advice of other ratings. I tossed the shrimp in a beer batter w/ garlic powder, white pepper, black pepper, and crushed red peppers. Fried the shrimp in butter. I did not at the pesto to the shrimp, but spread the pesto on the butter baguette. I also sprinkled the shrimp with parmesean cheese right before serving. I got raving reviews from my friends!

This was just OK when I made it. In the future I think I will try with more shrimp to pesto ratio.

I made this for dinner tonight and I loved it! It went great with some kettle chips and grapes. Pretty light, but filling at the same time. My husband wasn't a big fan, but he doesn't like French baguettes or shrimp. I am crazy about it!
