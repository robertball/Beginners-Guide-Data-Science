Found a wonderful deal on bulk vanilla beans and had to make my own extract. It's been 3 months and the extract has been used in everything from baked goods to vanilla milkshakes. Deep rich flavor and a delicious aroma even after baking. Will never go back to the store-bought stuff if I can help it.

I had to try it-still waiting to use it because it hasn't been 2 months yet. It's starting to turn dark-that's a good sign, and it smells wonderful-can't wait to use it!
