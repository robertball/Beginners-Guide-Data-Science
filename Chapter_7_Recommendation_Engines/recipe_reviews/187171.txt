A little bland as written. Next time I'll add basil and oregano to the ricotta mixture and will sprinkle the finished pizza with red pepper flakes.

My SF doesn't think it's really dinner unless there's meat involved. I tossed some chicken on top of the ricotta cheese layer. We both thought it was very tasty.

I used this recipe as a base. I liked the idea of ricotta/parm/spinach instead of Alfredo or a red sauce, but I knew ahead of time I would have to tweak the recipe for my liking. I used a homemade whole wheat crust that I rolled thin and pre-baked for 8-10 min, used fresh torn spinach instead of frozen, and added about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning to the ricotta mix. After smearing the mixture on the crust, I placed some grilled chicken, sliced green onions, mushrooms, and black olives. Topped with shredded mozzarella, then the sliced (Roma) tomatoes. When it came out of oven, I sprinkled a pinch each of oregano and crushed red pepper flakes. This might just be my new favorite pizza! I'm looking forward to trying the chopped artichoke next time as well!

With extra seasoning this is a wonderful change from tomato-sauced pizza. To add the extra flavor I brushed Kraft Tuscan House Dressing on the crust (I used a pre-baked crust so following the baking directions the package gave) followed with the ricotta mixture to which I added a generous amount of Italian Seasoning.

Very good. As I was putting it together I thought it needed something else so I sprinkled some oregano over the top before layering on the tomatoes. I will make this again.

This pizza was realy good. Since it is covered in veggies (I added mushrooms) there was no guilt in eating a good pizza.

The addition of Italian seasoning sprinkled over the top would have brought this recipe to 5 stars. I did add it and without...only 4. I didn't have the Italian 6 cheese blend so I used some shredded fresh mozzarella and as for the garlic I just sliced it up and placed it all over the pizza. The artichokes were a great addition! Pretty good pizza!!!

A good base recipe and very pretty I only added some dried oregano dried basil and red pepper flakes for a bit more flavor since I knew it would be bland without that. The artichoke was a nice idea. I made it on flatbread since it was just me having it and it made for a nice dinner w/a side salad and some wine. thanks for sharing!

Very nice. I'm teaching a coworker to bake bread and pizza dough was today's lesson. We made this pizza with Jay's Signature Pizza Dough and this pizza is delish! I had fresh not frozen spinach and decided not to chop it which worked really well. It could've been the tomatoes or maybe the cheese that made the second pizza (we made two--one with a thinner crust and one with a thicker one all with the same batch of dough) a little watery on top but it still turned out well. We both enjoyed the flavors in this. Oh for those of you who may not have ricotta--cottage cheese worked as a sub. (I've learned this bc bf hates ricotta but loves cottage cheese...go figure!). Thanks for the recipe!

This is an easy great pizza!! Instead of the ricotta cheese I replaced with cottage cheese and was just as delicious!! You can be very creative with this pizza instead of spinach I used some leftover steamed zucchini and it turned out awesome!!!

I loved this pizza!! I can't wait to try it with the artichokes!! I did a few things different. I mixed in some fresh frozen basil into the ricotta/Parmesan mixture. I did not use frozen spinach since I had fresh and I chopped a few handfuls and sprinkled it on top of the ricotta/parm after putting that in the prepared crust. I did use a mixture of Italian cheeses and sprinkled the top with oregano. Very tasty!!

The idea is red white and green so any small changes I made I wanted to stick with the main theme. I did everything as directed then added fresh chopped basil crushed red pepper and a Sicilian spice blend to the spinach/ricotta mix. I also used grilled marinated artichoke hearts using the oil from the marinade on top of my pizza crust before adding the layers. I served Italian sausage on the side so there was no need for a protein on the pizza. It was a huge hit with my foodie friends. I will make this again!
