I love this recipe! I had green, yellow & red pepper on hand, so I added all three. Since I am not a fan of raw onions, I also cut this down to 1/3 c. I also used olive oil in the recipe instead of vegetable oil. I let this sit for 24 hours. Next time I will double the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was a tasty salad and a good alternative to the same old coleslaw that I always make.  Before eating, I let the salad sit for about six hours and thought the flavor was great. The onion was way too overpowering, however, even though I only used one large yellow onion.  The next day, all of the flavors had mellowed out, including the onion, but I found that it was almost too bland and a little bit watery.  I did like it enough to make again, though.

actually i didn't find this to be bland at all. i substituted red wine vinegar (that was all i had) and cut the amounts down, as i only needed about half this recipe, but my husband and i really loved it. used it as a topping for grilled brats. great recipe. :)

Interesting use of vegetables, but rather bland. I made mine ahead for a BBQ, but found that the liquid from the marinating vegetables really watered down the dressing, so it hardly had any taste. I then doubled the dressing amounts, added 1/2 teaspoon celery seed and black pepper, and added a bit more cabbage. It was better, but I can't say it has become a favourite. If I give it a second chance, I think I'll use red onions to add to the colour of the dish (its appearance was better than its taste).

Great substitute for the usual salad.  I've followed the exact recipe, used bag mix cole slaw instead, and even done a spinach version.  Very nice and refreshing for summer!

Nice! It's the perfect complement to a sandwich and a pickle spear. The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it could use a pinch of celery seed. Not a lot. Just a tiny bit to perk up the flavors.

Something new and tasty...I like it!  I only used part of an onion though as I didn't want it's flavor to overpower the salad as other's have mentioned.
