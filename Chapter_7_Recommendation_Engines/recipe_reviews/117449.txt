We loved this.  I used 1 1/2 ground beef.  I used onions instead of shallots and omitted the taragon.  I used regular carrots cut in "coins", cooked them in the microwave and added the cooking water to the gr. beef mixture. I think I may have added a little more water, I just added until it looked right and there was a little gravy.  I served it with regular bisquick bisquits and it was great!! I was in a hurry, but I think it only took about 30 min. start to finish.

This was easy to make and does look nice, but unless you are a real big fan of Tarragon I suggest cutting it in half for this recipe.  Or coming up with your own comdo of spices.  I thought it would taste a little more like a hardy stew, so was slightly disappointed.  I might try it again without so much of one spice.

I left out the wine and replaced the tarragon with creole seasoning, then served it over mashed potatoes.  It was wonderful!

This was a very tasty dish with a lovely presentation. It was easy to make, dinner was on the table within about a half an hour but could really be a company dish. Will definately make again!

This was a definite hit with our company the other night.   I will cut the tarragon down by a 1/3 to 1/2 - as it was a little strong.   I substituted shredded carrots and didn't cook them before hand. I also omitted the wine, as one of the diners has an allergy to sulfites.   Mine was very thick, probably due to omitting the wine - so I'll add 1/2-1 cup of water next time.   I will definitely make this again!

This was good! I had a mishap with the puff pastry shells so I ended up serving this over "Grands Butter Tastin' biscuits which was good also. I also subbed cranberry juice for the red wine and garlic for the tarragon. Most of us topped ours with grated parmesan cheese.

This was a great recipe I made my biscuit bowls instead of using pastry puffs and I tweaked with the seasonings quite a bit since we did not have some of what was called for. but over all the recipe turned out rather well.

Good added beef stock instead of wine for more stew flavor. + a little chili seasoning.

Good, easy, one dish dinner. Omitted tomato paste.  Used ground turkey/chicken, chicken broth and white wine instead of red. About 1/2t each of poultry seasoning and parsley instead of tarragon.  Puff pastry shells could have ANYTHING in them and be scrumptious.  I love them!
