I've been on the hunt lately for zucchini salads and this is another keeper that has a dressing that complements it well. I used a Spirooli to make zoodles instead of slicing the zucchini.

I used jalape√±o because we like a little kick, halved the recipe with good results. This ones a keeper. Hubby will eat raw zucchini, hates it cooked. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this several times (with no changes), and it's a favorite. I've brought it to potlucks, it's always a hit. 

Note that it's very important to taste and drain the salad when it's been marinated to the desired degree -  for me, that happens at around the 3-4 hour mark. If I don't drain it, the flavors get way too strong and nobody wants to eat it.

I wish I wouldn't have put the onion soup in as it was way too strong of a flavor.

Neither myself nor my husband cared for this.  The onion soup taste was very strong.  Plus it wasn't appetizing to people at  the potluck either. I forgot to drain it. It was in a brownish liquid.  Most was thrown away.

Big hit with my team of nineteen volunteers at our church Food Pantry. Didn't change a thing, but I did spiralize the zucchini. There is a store brand (popular grocery) soup mix that has no beef in it for vegans. I made it the night before and drained off excess dressing morning of and they loved it! Thank you, Queen!
