I hadn't had corn fritters since I was a kid so when I had a few extra ears of corn from the garden I found this recipe and couldn't wait to fry them up. I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just my husband and I and it was plenty. I didn't have heavy whipping cream but I didn't let that stop me - I used 1/2% milk, which I had on hand. I am more of a savory type of gal and didn't use the cane syrup but instead sprinkled the fritters with salt. These turned out nice and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The corn lent the perfect amount of sweetness for us to this recipe. They are best right out of the pan - if they sit they will soften fairly quickly but will still be tasty.  Three ears of corn measures 1-1/2 cups of kernels.

First time I made these. I was looking for something to do with corn other than just butter...and this was a huge hit. We have decided to make is a staple in our family Thanksgivings from here on out! Thanks...Oh, we added just a little Ground Red Pepper...it added a little southern kick!

This was a spur of the moment cooking experiment, so I didn't have fresh corn on hand.  I opted for a can.  I don't think one can was enough corn, I prefer more veggie than breading.  This is a great afternoon snack or lunch food.  Reheats well.  I do not think 3inches of oil is necessary, I chose to do a half inch and they cooked perfectly.  I'm definitely a savory girl, so I recommend 1-2 tsp of salt.

Well, I blew the recipe and they were a bit soggy but that's fully on me. Behind the damage I did, I could taste how great they would've been!! On top of soggy on the inside, they were burnt on the outside... and were still great!! I will do these again because I'm sure done right, they're little chunks of corny heaven!!

I will make these again!  Never had corn fritters before so I read reviews.  I did make changes based on other reviews.  I added a pinch of cayenne, about a teaspoon of garlic powder, some season salt, and a bit of onion powder to the flour/powder mix.  Did fry in a pan with olive oil (about a quarter inch)  When I dropped cold mixture I flattened a bit to make a patty.  These were really good!  The batter makes a crispy almost tempura type crunch around the sweet corn mix.  I had mine with just salt, and husband tried with Mae Ploy and sriracha but said they were good with just salt and pepper.  What a great way to use up fresh corn off the cob.  Thank you :)  Next time I will try frying with coconut oil...just to see.

Made some changes to the cooking. Set my oven to 400Â°. I put about a cup of oil in my large cast iron frying pan and placed it in the oven for a few minutes to heat up. I scooped out some of the batter into my hands and shaped them into patties. It made 7 patties at about a 4inch diameter. I pulled out the oven rack and one by one I used a metal spatula to place the fritters into the oil. I did 10 minutes on one side, or until brown flipped them and did about 10 minutes on the other side or until brown.
Great recipe just a different cooking method.

I made a few changes: used half&half rather than heavy cream, and used brown sugar IN the batter as I have no idea what is cane syrup. It was bland, however I prefer bland, and just the right amount of sweet for me(1 T brown sugar to the recipe). I could see how the addition of cayenne or other spice could add to it, and do nicely, but like another reviewer, have no idea if corn fritters are SUPPOSED to be bland. But it had a very nice corn flavor. I also fried in just a 1/4 inch depth mix of crisco/bacon grease rather than a whole bottle of cooking oil. Cook just like pancakes

EASY.  This is a light and fluffy batter.  Love the ease of preparation.  Can easily prepare this batter as a sweet or savory fritter.  A little bland, so add your seasonings accordingly.  Not a big fan of the corn--I think it is a texture thing, but apple season is near. I will add a little sugar and vanilla.  Dust with powdered sugar.  Thank you.

I used leftover sweetcorn from last night which was quite sweet but these fritters had little flavor.  I sprinkled with sea salt and offered them with honey but my family all said they preferred my corn muffins to these. As with any type of frying, I had quite a bit of oil to dispose of, so these really seemed a waste.  We still have quite a few leftover and they are likely going to be too soft for eating tomorrow.

What a great way to use up leftover sweet corn! I had exactly 3 cobs left from dinner the other night, and had been racking my brain trying to figure out what to do with them. I figured they'd end up in the trash one of these days . . . but today while I was on Facebook, this recipe came across my feed from Allrecipes. I couldn't believe it! I jumped right out of my chair and said "honey, I'm making corn fritters!" They were really tasty! I had never had one before, and hubby agreed that they were a good use of that leftover corn!

There were a lot of reviews saying these were kind of bland, so I ended up using four ears of corn and adding 4 pieces of crumbled bacon to the mixture. Then I thought it needed a little more batter, so I also added an extra egg and half again the amount of flour and baking powder.  I really couldn't taste the bacon, so it either needs a lot more or it isn't worth the effort.  Everyone liked them, but they were very mild-flavored.  They had a nice lightly crispy texture on the outside and were soft on the inside.  The fresh corn meant that there were little bursts of sweetness as you took each bite.  I would make them again.

Loved these. Granted there isn't much flavor, but with syrup on it, it was just right. We want to make this one again.

I had left over corn and wanted to try something new.  I have never had a corn fritter & I found this recipe.  I felt it was very bland and not sweet at all.  My husband eats everything and I usually don't have left overs.  I have a whole dish left but the one he tried.  Since, I never had one if they are supposed to taste bland please ignore this.

Added a bit of cayenne per other reviewers' suggestions.   This is a very nice corn fritter - nothing too complicated and a tasty way to use up fresh corn.

Yes, I used baking soda instead of baking powder. Also used pancake syrup instead of maple! Still delicious!

They were delicious! I used fresh corn. The only issue was the popping. I think it must have been moisture in the corn kernels. Unfortunately when there was a pop oil splattered on me as well as the floor and stove. For that reason I probably won't make these very often.

Surprisingly good! and light. I thought I would miss cornmeal, like a hoe cake, but i didnt. I did add just a little extra cream, 1/8  cup or a bit more cream, because it was so thick. cream
