I love this recipe. I use a rump roast instead. I think it tastes a little better than brisket. (not as dry)

I used 1 can/bottle of beer and 1 cup of ketchup and 2 Tbs dijon mustard. It was delicious.

I wouldn't give Southern Living the credit for this recipe.  I got this identical recipe from a Better Homes & Gardens Crockpot Cookbook I've had for years.  The only differnce is instead of flour to thicken, BHG used cornstarch. In any case it is one of the best pot roasts I've made yet in my slow cooker.  The brisket was outstanding,the onions were sweet and the gravy perfect, expecially over the egg noodles I served it with.  Oh, I substituted tomato sauce for the chile sauce.

It could not be easier! It took me more time to find a grocery store that carries beef brisket than it did to make it. I would double the liquid ingredients in order to have more gravy - it is so good! PK

The kids (teenagers) hated it! The husband thought it was so-so, the sauce tasted only of beer and was boring, needed something, just not sure what, the meat was fork tender, I just wish it had tasted good!

The meat was tender (as most meat is in the crockpot anyway), but we didn't care for the sauce at all.  It tasted just like tangy beer and didn't compliment the meat well.  I did use tomato sauce instead of the chili sauce, but I can't imagine that it made much of a difference in the overall flavor.

I am often disappointed with crockpot roasts, but this was quite good and smelled great.  I didn't think there was a beer taste, but I actually used light beer.  I also used tomato based chili sauce (not thai), I do believe that it would taste quite different with tomato sauce.  If you must substitute I would think ketchup, chili & garlic would work.  I did add brown sugar to the sauce at the end.

I liked the sauce.  Very tasty yet tangy.  But Brisket itself seemed rather dried out and not as tender as I would have hoped.  Perhaps it could have used less time in the slow cooker.

Delicious!  Real tender meat.  Instead of chili sauce, I used ketchup and garlic powder.  I also added some canned diced tomatoes because that's the way we like it.  Thanks much for sharing!

I made this with a 2.5 pound brisket. I kept all the other measurements the same and cooked it on high for about 3 hours. It was not as tender as I had hoped but the flavor was great. I served it with redskin mashed potatoes and green beans. Everyone loved it! Even my PICKY 18 month old loved it. I will definitely add this to my recipe box. PS. I used a non-alcoholic beer.

I wasn't blown away by this at all.  The meat was very tender, but the sauce just wasn't that great.  It didn't have as much flavor as I expected, kind of blah.

Well, I'm giving this one a "4," but it has the potential to be a five with a more watchful cook.  The recipe suggests cooking on high for 4 to 6 hours.  My meat was slightly overcooked after 3 1/2 hours.  I should have checked it sooner.  The sauce was just great. This is a nice, easy meal.

did not like because it made the beef taste like pork so it just didn't taste of what I was expecting. Maybe I did something wrong is the recipe.

Beer and Brisket with this method of cooking, dutch oven on top of stove or in oven is very traditional (simmer 3 1/2 hours if you don't use slow cooker). The seasoning can differ though: Mother's reads; to dredge meat in 1/2 cup of flour and brown first. Then mix drippings, 1/4 C. Brown Sugar, 2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. ginger. grated med. onion, 1/2 cup water and 8 ounces of beer. Pour over meat in cooker of choice. Soak 16 each of prunes and apricots to reconstitute and add over meat last fourth of the way of cooking.  This is heaven!! - and I've put off for years letting this out of the family!

This is a great recipe, I don't know why some people gave a bad review. When I made this, I wasn't sure if all people in my family would like it because it has a lot of chilli sauce. But  everybody love it and keep asking for more. I add more brown sugar to ease the chilli flavor. I am not a cook or anything, I usually buy my food but this recipe is so easy to make.

I gave this recipe 2 stars only because the meat was so tender.  My family did not like the sauce/gravy at all.  I followed the recipe and did not make any changes.  This is not a recipe I'll make again.

This was good but I thought it would be much better.  My brisket didn't slice, it shredded so we ate it on buns.  Not what we had planned originally but it was okay.

After following the directions except omitting the garlic I found this to be rather dry.  My husband thought the juice was a little spicier although our three kids ate it with no trouble.  I might make this again with a few changes.  The juice/sauce was good on mashed potatoes.

I added a little extra brown sugar, but this was very good.  We shredded the meat to make burritos.
