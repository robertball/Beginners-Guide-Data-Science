On a quest for a new shrimp dish once a week....this recipe was a delight!  I added onion and also used cilantro.  The Uncle Ben's Boil in a Bag Brown rice was the perfect amount for 1 lb of shrimp to feed 2.  Double for 4.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and served it over linguine.

I made this last night with white rice. I added some grated lemon peel (after squeezing the lemon, it seems a shame to throw out the rind), chopped onion and some chopped vegies (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower) and some onion powder, along with some salt and pepper. Fabulous! Also, I didn't pay much attention to exact measurements for ingredients. It didn't seem to matter. This appears to be a very forgiving and flexible recipe. We coupled it with a Sauvignon Blanc and it was heaven!

Lacked flavor... I made this recipe according to the directions.  I used pinot grigio as the white wine.  Shrimp were cooked perfectly.  However, the meal was not flavorful enough to satisfy my husband and my tastes.  We added pepper, more garlic, and red pepper which improved the taste.  One of the previous reviews mentioned adding onion.  Maybe this recipe would be better if onion was added.

This was delicious.  I added frozen peas just because I needed a little more green.  Very good. Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.

This made for a great new year's eve dinner, and it was so quick and easy!  It's reminiscent of a favorite dish my mom used to make with feta broiled on top, but I don't think this could have been any better.  Delish!

Cook your rice in chicken broth with slivers of lemon and some med. chopped onion. It adds to over all flavor. Add a little chile flakes to give this a little zing.

I found this recipe to be a little dull.  However, if you add in some capers it turns out pretty good.

Simple and delicious.  If you make this as a main dish, try adding some steamed veggies, i used asparagus and broccoli, and lay them under the shrimp and cover with the same sauce and it is excellent.  I also used some hot sauce for a little kick which added a little something as well.

I used some of the other reviewers suggestions and added peas, red pepper flakes and substituted chicken broth for wine.  This was a great easy weeknight meal.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any rice so I used whole wheat couscous. I added fresh spinach and onion.

This recipe is very easy and can be prepared in no time if you already have your brown rice cooked and your shrimp peeled and deveined.  I was expecting the sauce to be a little sharp from the wine and lemon, but the flavor was mild and buttery.  I think of this dish as pesco-vegetarian comfort food, probably not company-worthy but a good quick standby dish.  As a bonus, it's also naturally gluten-free for my celiac daughter.

I made this tonight and it is simply delicious. The sauce is light and flavorful. I didn't use parsley and I put a little salt and some broccoli in my rice after it was cooked. The broccoli steamed in the hot rice. It was as good as any fine seafood restaurant. Yum.

This is a wonderful dish, and the only thing I could possibly say is that it is very rich, and portions go a lot further than listed unless your family are very big eaters.  We ate it with the BLT salad also here at allrecipes, and my family loved the meal.  This rice is definitely a recipe we will file and make again.  It will also go well with angel hair pasta or another pasta like angel hair.

As written, this recipe came out more like soup than any of the photos!  1/2 tsp of cornstarch failed to "thicken it up" at all....!  Tasty, though.

As someone just learning to cook, I found this very easy to make and the timing instructions were FANTASTIC. I always tend to over or under-cook meats and seafood, but my shrimp turned out perfect.
That being said, I do think it needed some tweaking. I added salt, a lot more garlic, and I think I'll add onions next time as well.

This recipe was so easy and quick to make, I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as good as it was.  But the garlic and lemon flavors were just perfect.  I used chicken broth instead of the wine, and the brown rice was the perfect bed for the shrimp. Great recipe!

SO good! Made this tonight for dinner. I doubled it but didn't have enough shrimp so I added a package of imitation crab. No white wine either so used chicken broth and instant brown rice...but yummy! Everyone loved it!

Eh, it's a good BASE recipe...but really needed sprucing up.  I sauteed a white onion in the OO and butter.  I also added frozen peas and carrots, a little ginger, salt, pepper, and probably twice as much lemon juice as was called for and used chicken broth instead of white wine.  Even after all that, it still is lacking something. But it's still good.  Thanks for the idea!

made this for dinner last night. Wonderful flavor combination. I added fresh asparagus, onion and button mushrooms, because we had them from our garden and love veggies.

Quick and easy. The dish however lacks flavor. I did
Increase garlic,lemon juice etc. but it still lacks a pop of flavor. A nice basic recipe and worth experimenting with. Thank You for Sharing.

I made it without the shrimp as I was looking for a rice side dish to go with the chicken I already had for dinner. The only change I made was to add a little salt.

We loved this!!  So light and refreshing.  The lemon is perfect.  Super quick and easy for a weeknight meal.  Uses easy on hand ingredients too.  We will definitly add this to our rotation.

OUTSTANDING!  I didn't serve the brown rice, but the shrimp is truly excellent.  I will double sauce and serve over pasta next time.  I used sherry because I didn't have white wine and it tasted great.  This is a recipe that you will want to double, because everyone will want second servings.

I thought I would love this.  I love shrimp and I love brown rice and I like wine sauces.  Sorry, bland. per my husband: very bland.  I even added onions, green onions, cilantro.  Salt, pepper, thyme, sage could not help either.

Good but not great. My husband and I thought that the rice/sauce ratio was a little off. The dish was a little bland b/c there wasn't enough sauce.

When I have time I love to be creative in the kitchen but those nights when I come home after a hard day I want something quick and easy but delicious, too.  This fits the bill perfectly!   I serve it along with fresh green beans or broiled asparagus.

Perfect!  To o many shrimp recipes have so much spice that the delicate flavor of the shrimp gets lost.  This one was just right, cooked up beautifully, and made a nice presentation.

The whole family enjoyed this.  I sauteed some shallots and celery with the garlic, and didn't add cornstarch.  It was wonderful and we'll have it again.

mmmmm Good. Made a few additions.  Added green onion. Also used a tsp of lemon grass and used cilantro and Vietnamese coriander in place or parsley. The sauce was wonderful and the shrimp tender and juicy.

This was okay. I will say the mixture of the white wine and lemon juice was a bit tart and different. I added parmesan cheese and extra parsley to the finished product and this helped balance the flavors a lot.

I didn't have parsley, so I used basil.  To zip it up, I also added cracked red pepper and a little more lime (instead of lemon) and more garlic ... perfect!!!

It was super quick and easy. I did change and omit a few things. I used moscato wine, didn't use the parsley, added Parmesan cheese, and served over fettuccine noodles. Whole family loved it!!!

Too buttery for my taste, not enough lemon and way too much parsley. I will try it again but will make it with the modifications above and with some of the mods suggested here by others.  I would also suggest using small or medium shrimp too.

I really liked this recipe.  However, my family thought it was too lemony.  It had a very nice light feel and I really liked the lemon tang.  I added peas, but do not think that changed the overall flavor.

Delicious! I added crushed red pepper, nixed the white wine and cornstarch, and it came out really well! I served mine over pasta.

If you like Chicken French you'll love this!  I love lemon dishes and this was perfect.  I added green onions when I added the garlic (extra garlic), and more wine and lemon juice to make more of a sauce.  I also used Uncle Bens long grain wild rice and served it with a side of asparagus.  It was delicious and easy!

Great meal. My wife picked it out as something to try. It was super easy to make and was a hit with company. There is plenty of room to play with this recipe so it doesn't have to be the same every time. We are going to try this with chicken soon.

What a great simple and healthy dish...Even my picky boyfriend who is not a big fan of shrimp or eating healthy enjoyed it!  Served it with green beans...will definitely make again.

Very good. The wine was a little overwhelming, so next time I would use less. But, overall, very light and yummy.

Excellent!  This dish is so easy and simple, perfect for a weeknight meal.  The only thing missing is some salt and pepper.  I use unsalted butter and added 1/2 tsp. kosher salt and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  I always make my brown rice in the oven since I have better luck with that than the stovetop.  Served with some sugar snap peas for a complete meal.

you can't go wrong with this one. i make this at least once a week. each time i do, i alter it a bit to my liking. (either i add more chicken broth to make the recipe more "soupy" and sometimes, i just add a bit of baking soda to make it creamier). good stuff.

Heavenly!  I have made this three times now.  I used cooked shrimp.  To prevent the shrimp from becoming tough, I added them at the very end after the cornstarch had been added and the sauce cooked to the desired thickness.  Then I just cooked long enough to make sure the dish was heated throughout.  This dish is a favorite at our house.

This is good basic recipe.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth rather than 1/2 c. wine, because we like it saucier.  I added 2 more cloves of garlic, used only 1 tbsp of olive oil and added some bell peppers because I had some that needed to be used.  I served it with crushed red pepper for the adults and everyone enjoyed it.  It has a very lemony flavor.  Very good.

This was absolutely scrumptious! And quick! I used precooked shrimp because that's was what I had on hand, and that made it even quicker.  I also substituted cilantro for parsley.  Both my husband and I loved it. Thanks for this recipe - it is a keeper in our household as far as we are concerned.

I sautéed some strips of red bell pepper and onion. Added some minced garlic and dill. My husband doesn't like brown rice so used white. It was tasty, simple and quick. Could probably use more lemon juice and some heat--red pepper flakes or cayenne. I'd make it again.

This recipe was very easy and quick. Longest part is waiting on the rice, so started cooking the shrimp once the rice was ready. I always try a recipe as is before tweaking. The sauce never really thickened but that was okay as it spread through the rice nicely. For my tastes next time I will try some of the suggestions in the reviews such as cilantro for parsley and some red pepper flakes.

I really liked this. It has a delicate flavor. The sauce never thickened, so next time I’ll add a little more cornstarch. Also think that salt and pepper improved the taste.

The recipe calls for 3 Tbs. of oil and butter each. In my opinion, it was way to oily. I have used a similar recipe that also calls for oil, but much less. I also had to another 1/4 teaspoon cornstarch because the original amount was not thickening the liquid very well. I did follow the recipe exactly as written.

Really loved this , the lightness but flavorful. Only suggestion. Cut cooking time of shrimp ( all together ) in half. I did this as shrimp takes "no" time to cook to not dry out and toughen.

We loved this easy recipe. Only changes were no garlic (stomach issues), added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and served over Angel Hair pasta. The fresh parsley was wonderful and added a great flavor. A keeper for this family.

This recipe is very simple and quick!  I did add some seasoning (garlic salt, ground pepper) because it was a little blah without it.  I also used jasmine rice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great.  I will definitely make it again!

Trying for a new recipe for a quick week night dinner. This one fit the bill! The shrimp with lemon seasoning is a good compliment. We used brown rice for our dinner. Prepared sliced  thin yellow and zucchini squashes, dabbled with seasonings, and roasted; a good addition to the plate.

I made this with cooked shrimp because that's what I was able to order online.  I sauted it in olive oil and butter with white wine and garlic, but because the shrimp was already cooked, it didn't absorb as much of the flavor.  Otherwise it was very good, but I will use raw shrimp next time. 

PS  McCormick makes "Garlic Butter Shrimp Scampi" seasoning mix that includes most of the ingredients and instructions in this recipe.  I haven't tried that yet either, but it would make fixing this a lot faster.

Simple, flavourful - just enough lemon without being overpowering.
Would make more rice though
Didnt seem to have enough for 4 servings yet plenty of shrimp and sauce.

Will make again.

I used white rice that I made with saffron. The shrimp were delicious and nothing was left over! Very good and the sauce was great.
For my rice, I like a “fluffy” rice. 
2 tbspns butter. Melt in a skillet, add 1 cup rice and cook until the rice is opaque but do not let it brown. Heat 1/2 cup water in the microwave for 1.5 minutes. Add saffron and let it steep. Heat 1 1/2 cup water in the microwave for 2.5 minutes. When the rice is opaque add the hot water. It is important that the water is hot. This will stop the rice from being sticky. Cover and simmer about 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it as it gets closer to being done so it does not scorch.  It was great with this shrimp.

it would of been nice to list how to do the recipe if you wanted to use already precooked shrimp.  I had to do some googling, since I'm not a big fan of doing recipes with raw shrimp (too much work)  I wasn't sure how long to saute the shrimp, if already cooked.  Luckily for me, Pintrest had the exact recipe, with already cooked shrimp.  (Thank God!!!)

Recipe was easy and I used all the ingredients but did not thicken with the cornstarch as when I put in the linguine, not rice, I added extra olive oil for flavor and the sauce was already reduced.  I also added chili flakes, Italian seasoning, and parsley.  We enjoyed the dish and it does need salt on the pasta!

My family loves this recipe but I did make  changes to it. I use Holland white wine with lemon and instead of brown rice I use jasmine rice , its much lighter and I believe it compliments the sauce a lot better.

This is a good recipe, with good ingredients but it lacks seasoning. I know everyone is more concerned about using or over using salt these days but there is just no flavor without a little salt and pepper, which this recipe desperately needs, both in the shrimp dish and the rice.

Really good! 
1.  It needs more lemon juice.  Like at least 1/4 a cup (to your taste)
2.  A dash of salt
3. A little more garlic

great and so easy!  I had some already cooked shrimp to use up and some brown rice I had already made, so this recipe was perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.  didn't change a thing.  I usually make shrimp scampi (very similar to this recipe) but the addition of cornstarch just made this meal POP.  My family loved it.  Definitely will make again.

I like to keep it simple, but I also wanted to taste good. This recipe fills the bill.    I did not change a thing and plan to refer back to this many times.

Quick and simple. I didn't have any white wine so substituted with coconut milk. It was delicious.

Very bland recipe. The shrimp is fine, but some butter, salt, or Lemon juice, or a combo of the three should be added to the rice.

Quick and easy peasy....and so yummy!  I cheated and used the microwavable rice packages.  Just as good, along with a salad.

Delish!  Followed the recipe, except used half wine and half chicken broth.  Used half parsley and half cilantro, dried. Sautéed some chopped onion and yellow pepper, before adding the garlic. Served over jasmine rice cooked with chicken broth. The shrimp were perfect, the sauce was yummy. Will make this again.

This turned out to be an alright dish. I didn't use brown rice because I can't get passed the taste or the texture. Used white rice and also added soy sauce, cilantro and garlic in the marinade for the shrimp.

This is a great way to cook shrimps.  I served this over white rice cooked in chicken broth and added green onions and more garlic to it.  Absolutely delicious!

My version of your recipe came out great.  I cooked the rice in vegetable broth, seasoned with salt free "Spike".  I substituted the butter and olive oil for grapeseed oil.  Used sweet Marsala wine rather than white.  Garnished with fresh herbs from garden, parsley, cilantro, basil and rosemary. And did not thicken the sauce.  It was very good.

Tried it without wine, butter, cornstarch, and parsley so it was healthier. Adding mrs dash, garlic, and Italian seasoning instead. I used a little too much lemon but so yummy and easy.

Delicious! I have made this twice. The first time I didn't use any wine and the second time I used Moscato (a strange choice for shrimp, I know, but it worked). This is a very quick and easy recipe to prepare. Some people say it is too bland. I don't actually like a whole lot of spices, so they may be correct. But for me, it is perfect.

I tried this tonite, and OMG!!!!  It was WONDERFULLY YUMMY!!  I followed the directions but took heed on a couple reviewers...I also like a more soupy sauce, so I added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth (used that instead of the wine). I had to stop eating so I could have seconds tomorrow!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe...it is a DEFINITE keeper!! :)

I made the brown rice separate according to the instructions.   Used only 2 Tbsp of wine... The cornstarch I dissolved with a couple of tablespoons of water before mixing it in the hot pan. Added some sugar and black pepper to taste!! Serve with spring vegetables!  Loved it!!

Okay, so I didn't have white wine, or minced garlic or parsley or brown rice - so I just mixed the butter and oil and threw in some Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning and green peppers, served over alfredo with broccoli.  It was still good!

I'm a believer in following a new recipe to the letter for the first time and then adding my own flair to the dish.  This recipe was phenomenal as is, but next time I might use some frozen peas or other complementary vegetable and/or perhaps pineapple.  This is a very yummy dish!

This was great! I had to add some spice's to the sauce to add additional flavor, but other than that the recipe was fantastic! I received rave reviews!
