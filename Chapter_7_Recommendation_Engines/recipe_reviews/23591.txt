Tasted great. It is almost the exact same as the one I grew up with that my mother made. The only change I made was to leave out the mayonaise.

This has been a favorite at parties. Since my boyfriend can't get enough of it, I made a lower fat version using lowfat sour cream and mayonnaise -- not *quite* the same but pretty close.

I brought this to an office pot luck and it was a big hit!  Someone even asked me if it's a recipe that has been in my family for years!

This recipe has been in our family favorites for as long as I can remember as well.  
There are just a few differences in our version.
Increase Mayonaise to 1/2 cup (we use Best Foods)
Add shredded lettuce after the avacado
Increase Tomatoes to 3 medium
Add a bunch of diced green onions
Decrease Cheese to 8 oz.
Slice the olives

This was very good.  Made it for a few friends and it was received well.  Personally I didn't really "love" the mayo with this, but others really liked it and asked for the recipe.  Thanks for the post.

Wow...this was a great hit and gone in an hour! Upgrades I made were to include 1 (16 oz) jar of Mrs. Renfro's mild salsa in the layering and to add 1 spicy guacamole mix packet to the guacamole to give it some zip (the spice packet can be found in most produce sections). The layering should be refried beans, salsa, guacamole, sour cream/mayo/seasoning mixture, etc. The reason for this is the first time I made it and placed the salsa next to the sour cream mixture it made one big mess on the platter and didn't look to appetizing (even though everyone inhaled it). The second time around it look much better on the plate when the salsa was not next to the sour cream mixture.  Great easy appetizer for any ball game!

very similar to what I've been making for many years; I add a small can of diced green chilies to the beans; then 3 mashed avocados with a 1/4 cup of salsa; then 4 oz cream cheese mixed with 4 oz sour cream & the taco seasoning; then 2 roma tomatoes chopped ; then 3 sliced green onions; then a 4 oz can sliced black olives drained; then a combination of shredded cheddar and jack cheese, as much as you want.  Always a bit hit!

The entire family loved this!  The seasoned sour cream mixture made it our favorite over other mexican layer dips.  We will use this recipe many times.  Thanks!

Really good! There was a lot of cheese. I would add less cheese and more veggies or beans.

This is so addictive!! It's definitely my new football party staple. I added two things which I think made it even better... I mixed in about 1/3 cup chunky salsa into the refried beans. I also added a layer of lettuce on top of the sour cream mixture...  so much better with a little fresh crunch! YUM

Instead of mayo, I combine whipped cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning.  Sooooo, good and always goes first on any buffet table!

This dip took about 30 mn to make because I made guacamole from scrach.
It was a hit at a picnic with family and friends. I got many requests for the recipe. I made 2 changes,  I used cream cheese instead of mayo and only used 2/3 the package of taco seasoning.

This was great! I LOVED the way the taco seasoning and the sour cream tasted together.(I DIDNT use the whole package of taco seasoning tho. Just enough to add color and the flavor was bold.) That is what made the dish. I warmed up the beans with a little milk and shredded cheese, so it wasnt so thick.

Good, but my friends and I make it minus the mayo. Don't forget to scoop out your tomatoes or else it'll get soupy by the end of the party!

Good recipe, exactly what I wanted.  Subbed out diced green chilies instead of black olives because I am not personally a huge olive fan.  Also, doubled the recipe for a large pan for a party.  Used one package of reg and one hot of taco mix to add a little zing.  Added an extra layer w/ some fresh cilantro overtop.  Absolutely delicious!!!

Good recipe. There are several versions and I think  most people make it to their own taste. I personally don't care for packaged Taco Seasoning so I make my own, omit the mayo, use refried black beans as opposed to Pinto beans and I thinly slice pickled jalapenos on top. The other change I make is that I spead a thin layer of good quality salsa over the beans.
It's an attractive tasty dip that always is the first to go at a party!

Made a lot of dip! Very good, but should all be eaten right away. Leftovers don't look very good the next day.

I made this in a 11" X 14" baking dish, thinking this would be more than enough for a casual get together. It was the first dish devoured and I was constantly reminded that I should have made a larger portion. Very simple rescipe, but totally delicious

Love it. I could not find refried beans so I took a can of red kidney beans mashed them up, graded half a onion, chopped up one jalapeno and aded half a cube of vetagable stock dissolved in a little bit of hot water. Put the mixture in a hot pan and cook out all the water but not too dry. This is a bit more effort but worth it!

I made this for my hubby's 30th birthday party a few days ago. It was a HUGE hit! I even gave out the recipe to a few people. Also a bonus was that it was very easy to make! This will be a keeper for me!

I made a few modifications and everyone really liked my version: I used refried black beans, made the guacamole myself (mashed two large avocados w/the juice of one lime, salt, pepper), added a layer of well-drained spicy pico de gallo, omitted the mayo from the sour cream mixture, used finely shredded colby-jack cheese, and topped it with diced black olives and sliced pickled jalapenos. Spicy! :)

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE. I ADDED A LAYER OF SEASONED HAMBURGER AFTER THE BEANS JUST FOR FILLER. I CUT UP A WHOLE BAG OF FLOUR TORTILLAS INTO TRIANGLES AND DEEP FRIED THEM TO GO WITH THIS DIP AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. I WILL BE SENDING THIS TO SCHOOL WITH MY SON WHEN HE HAS HIS HOLIDAY PARTIES.

My version leaves the Mayo out, but I mix about a quarter packet of taco seasoning with the beans before putting first layer down.  I have people that don't like tomatoes so I put a thin layer of Pace Medium salsa on beans.  I also chop cilantro and sprinkle that on top.  Cilantro really adds to the flavor!

First of all, let me be up front that I did not add the mayo to this recipe.  I didn't really care for this, though.  I thought the taco seasoning way overpowered the other flavors and the smoothness of the sour cream.  If I made it again, I would do it without the taco seasoning or with maybe 1/2 packet.  I made it in an 11x7 pan and that seemed to be the perfect size.  It was quick and easy to make and made for an attractive presentation.  Other people at the party really liked it but I would not eat it again as is.

This was an interesting take on seven layer dip. I was a little skeptical of the mayo/sour cream mix, but it adds a bit of a spicy kick to an otherwise boring seven layer dip. I took it to a pot luck and it got gobbled up pretty quickly.

I made this for a Valentine's Day party and made it in the shape of a heart. I didn't measure anything, just put the refried beans on the bottom, then a layer of salsa, then the sour cream (I skipped the mayo), then the guacamole. I added some chopped yellow pepper and skipped the green onions and olives. It was very pretty and tasted great!

This recipe is really good, however, I use bean dip instead of refried beans, it gives more flavor and I omit the mayonnaise and just mix the sour cream with the taco seasoning. Everyone loves it.

this is a favorite of mine also, however, I put the cheese on last and then put it under the broiler or a real hot oven 450+ just to melt the cheese and make it bubbly..it is really good..

I've had several versions of this dip, I think this is the best one yet. I made four pans, which didn't take too long. My co-workers polished off the first one by the time I had the others made. It got rave reviews from everyone. Perfect as it is written.

This is a great dip.  I took it to a 4th of July party and everyone enjoyed it.  I used vegetarian refried beans, light mayo and sour cream, and 2% sharp cheddar cheese.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe - yummo!

Very good and everyone loves this dish. I used red onion instead of green and only had a partial packet's worth of taco seasoning. This was great. I made my own guacamole.

Very tasty!  When adding the taco seasoning to the Mayo/sour cream mixture add about half then more to taste as you go.  The entire taco packet (1 oz.) was a bit strong for me.  Still great, I will just add less next time!

I took this to a party and the bowl was practically licked clean. My only changes were omitting the mayo and taco seasoning (just added a little cumin and chili podwer to the refried beans) and I used mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar. I'll definitely make it again!

I love this dip. However, I changed up ingredients a little. Using green olives instead of black gives better flavor. I used equal amounts of sour cream and mayo. with the taco seasoning( I always used McCormicks). Depending on taste ( I like it hot) add tabasco to guac. No matter how you make this dip it has always been a winner.

This is always a hit, but I adjust the recipe just a bit.  I use a combination cream cheese and sour cream in place of the mayo and sour cream.  I also use Hidden Valley ranch fiesta seasoning in place of taco seasoning.  We skip the olives since the family doesn't like them.  Make sure you discard the tomato seeds before chopping them up.

This is a simple no cook recipe.   Make sure the guacomole is good because it will make a difference.  It was a hit at the party and I could make it somewhat in advance and not have to worry about a warm dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

I lost my mom's old recipe for 7-layer dip so I searched this website and found that this one tastes even better!  I use the chicken taco seasoning mix and make my own guacamole. I've made it for a couple parties and it's gone in no time.

If I could I would give this recipe 10 stars.  I've been making this dip for the past twenty years (half my life)  and it is my favorite dip.  I mash up two avacados instead of adding guacamole.  It's also best to let this sit in the refrigerator over night so all of the flavors can meld together.  I always have requests for this recipe.

Easy and yummy.  Everyone loved it at my  Halloween party.  I served it in a pumpkin bowl, placed the cheese last and used a green bell pepper to make a pumpkin face.  Cute!

This was so yummy, my whole family loved it. I used a little less mayo and a little more taco seasoning. Thank you!

I thought that this would be gross with the mayo but I was wrong. Had to eliminate the avocado since my Mom is allergic. Just used a 14 oz can of petite diced tomates, drained, instead of chopping a tomato. Only sprinkled the olives on half since I hate them and hubby loves them. We love Tex Mex, thanks for adding a new recipe for us to use!

It didn't get completely consumed at the appetizer party, but hubby and I had no trouble finishing it over the next several days.  The flavours were very compatible, but a little understated.   I reduced the taco seasoning after reading the reviews, but I will try the full amount next time.  I also added a layer of mild and shredded iceberg lettuce which added some crunch and stayed surprisingly fresh for several days.  Next time I will try a spicier salsa.  See my modifications under Other Versions.

This is even better if you use a can of Frito-Lay bean dip instead of plain refried beans.

Nowhere does it mention the size of serving dish necessary.  Making for the 1st time, too much ingredients for size of serving dish.  Sadly, had to start all over.

I made this for a house party and it was good! I really liked the mayo/sour cream mix - I ended up dipping tortilla chips in the leftovers. But in the layer dip I would prefer just plain sour cream.

Delicious! But while I love mayonnaise, I do leave it out of this recipe. I just don't think it's necessary on any level within this dish. This is such an easy dish to take to pot lucks. Throw this together, take along a bag of tortilla chips and you're good to go!

This dip got rave reviews at our 4th of July BBQ and disappeared before I knew it.  I used homeade guacamole, and the taco seasoning mixed with the sour cream is incredible.  I would definitely make this dip again.

very good dip! I would have never guessed to use mayo.
for my version, i used Kraft's "Hot and Spicy" mayo, cause i thought the flavors would mesh well, plus since there was no salsa or spicy elements to this dip, i felt it needed some zing! I turned out great.

The mayo is not necessary... in recipes like this, it just adds calories to a perfectly good and already tasty combination of ingredients. Also, the people who said to leave out the tomato seeds were right. Gracias!!

I left out the guac (fiance doesn't like) and added more cheese. I had to make this at a tailgate so I also had to sub green chilies for the onions since I didn't have a food processor. It turned out really well!

This was very good.  It needed a little more texture though.  The next time I make it, I think I'll add a layer of beans or seasoned ground meat.  And, II'll press in an additional layer of tomatoes and onions (I hate olives so I left them out) between the refried beans and the guacamole in addition the top layer.  The flavor was good, but the tomatoes and onions get all over the place and without them, it's mush.  I'd recommend letting this sit over night.  Otherwise, reduce the amount of taco seasoning.  It's really overwhelming on the first day.

Delissshh!
Made homemade guacamole(from this site as well by Bob Cody). Just used a little less sourcream, no other changes.
This is the 2nd time and will not be the last time to be certain(yum).

This recipe is quick and easy and wonderful to take as a quick dish to parties and picnics.  I gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things- used softened cream cheese instead of mayo and bean dip instead of plain refried beans.  5 stars for that!

Yummy.  We didn't use the mayo and just made a few changes to fit our tastes.  This is such a popular party appetizer...it's hard to go wrong.  Thankx.

Truly one of the best dips I've ever eaten! The combo of flavors is incredible and the avacado adds a refreshing touch. I could make a meal out of this!!!!

This is great, it is always always always a huge hit when I take it to potlucks.  Definately take the time to make your own guacamole, the stuff you buy premade can not compare.  Other than making the guacamole, there is no work to making this.

We love this dip! I skip the mayo and use jalapenos instead of olives. It's always been a big hit when I bring it to a party.

Yum! Having tried other similar dips I was expecting yummy goodness but not to the level that this recipe delivers. Seasoning the sour cream takes it up a notch and has made this my go-to recipe for layered dips. The entire family loved it!

I made this in a 9x13 and brought it to work...there is nothing left and there is still 2 hours to go !
Very addicting flavor. I used the Quick and Easy Guacamole Recipe in it.

Followed to the letter EXCEPT I left out the mayo because I just didn't think it belonged in this dish. I must say this was delicious and so easy. My boyfriend raved and said it was the best 7-layer he's ever had because of the taco seasoning in the beans and sour cream. This is coming with me to the next party I go to. Thanks so much.

Made as the recipe stated and it was good.  I used refried black beans which I didn't care for.  This still isn't the recipe I remember making years ago but it was close.

Great recipe. I don't like beans but the layers complimented each other very well, and I kept going back for more. I left the mayo out, and it was still a hit!

Brought this to a party and it was a hit! It was the only dish that was gone by the end of the party!!! I used cream cheese instead of mayo, and I used fiesta cheese blend instead of cheddar. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Tasted GREAT!!! Thanks!!

EXCELLENT recipe!! Everyone loved it! Several asked for the recipe also. I did find it hard to find the right size container though, but I did figure it out and thought I should share with everyone.  If you use an 8 cup container it fits perfectly. Enjoy!

This was okay. The only change I made was I omitted the tomatoes and put fresh cilantro over the top. I didn't like the flavor of mayonnaise and taco seasoning in this dip. My husband, and my guests liked it a lot, though.

This recipe was so easy to make and I took it to a BBQ and it was gone within an hour! I've already been asked to bring it to the next get together.

This was a great recipe. I didn't use the mayo or green onions. I also added dry ranch dressing mix to the sour cream and used homemade taco seasoning. Super easy and tasty!

Great recipe! I did not use the mayo either and I added a pound of cooked burger. My family actually likes this layered in tostada shells and served for dinner.

This dip is always a hit!  I have made this several times and usually double recipe when I make it for big parties.  I found that the dip tastes just as great without the mayo.  I don't take exact measurements of the cheese, tomatoes, green onions, and olives and just eyeball the amounts to my liking.

Awesome dip that is always the first to go. Hubs and I keep catching each other sneaking into the fridge with a tortilla chip to have "one last bite".... LOL!  Made it this time without the black olives (didn't have any), but did not miss them and avoided the extra fat. Like many other reviewers, I used lite sour cream, fat free refried beans and left out the mayo; therefore we avoided all that extra fat as well.  Super dip that is still scrumptious in a low fat version.

I made this for a party and it was a big hit!  It is the best nacho dip I have ever had.  I used the “Refried Beans Without the Refry” recipe from this site as well as the ” Guacamole” by Bob Cody and the “Taco Seasoning I” recipe.  All these together created a dynamite nacho dip!  I served the olives on the side as not everybody likes olives.

Super easy and quick to throw together.  I had no mayo so I left it out...didn't miss it, it was great this way. Other changes I made were to stir in a bit of salsa into the refried beans so they weren't so 'stiff' and I also sprinkled the top with a bit of chopped fresh cilantro. This was a hit!

I have another recipe that I use with ground beef. However, I needed one that did not use any type of meat because some of my relatives are vegetarians. I also had to changed the sour cream to tofu sour cream. It worked out beautifully. This is a great recipe!.

This the best 7 layer taco dip recipe I have found.  addidtion of the taco seasoning mix to the sour cream/mayo mixture really makes it. I would also recommend that you make homemade guacamole as well.

Made it just as directed and it's very tasty. I was worried about the sour cream/mayo mix because of the reviews, but I gave it a go and it adds a great "zest" of flavor. Very easy and inexpensive to make. Served them with scoop chips.

This was great and incredibly easy to make. It's easy to lighten it up by using reduced-fat mayo, sour cream, and cheese. I use refried black beans and they taste great in the dip.

Awesome dip! My layers were: refried beans, spicy guacamole, sour cream mixture (1/4 cup cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream and the packaged taco mix), thin layer of cheddar cheese, cilantro, black olives and green onions. This was topped with more cheese and spoonfuls of salsa. Right before serving I squeezed lime juice on top. *I subbed the mayo w/cream cheese after reading multiple other reviews.   Served with Tostidos Scoops and Fritos Scoops.

I followed the advice from other reviewers to leave out the mayo.  It was very tasty, though next time I might go lighter on the taco seasoning.

I started making this simple little recipe probably about 5 or 6 years ago now, and it's become one of my signature dishes everyone asks for! I make it just like the recipe, with one small change.  I started adding one more can of refried beans, and i spoon it in little dabs on top of the sour cream layer.  When you spread it, it mixes slightly with the sour cream mix and makes it even more tasty, and also more filling!! Then I just top it with the cheese and veggies like normal! I can't tell you how many events I've made it for and its always the first thing to run out (which is why i bring two pans now!)

Great reviews from all the party goers.
I used rinsed black beans and seeded the tomatoes so the dip didn’t get soggy.

great dish! it was a hit with the whole family!! I will definitely make this again but not use mayo. I read the reviews before making the dish and a lot of people said the mayo was too strong so I made it with a small amount but it was still a bit off putting. So def a repeat dish but without the mayo.

This was  very much like the Taco Dip recipe I had from about 20 years ago.  Instead of the mayo I used 1/4 c. Ranch Dressing  (the one I buy is a little thicker than most).  It was delicious and a big hit at the party.  I'll surely be making this again!

It was a hit at a gathering I attended.  The taste was to die for!!  I did give it a little twist by adding jalapeno garlic seasoning, 1/2 a lime juice squeezed and my favorite, cilantro! It was a KNOCK OUT!!

I give it a 5 star because it's a great dip.  I made it a second time and changed up the types of layers which still came out great as I wanted a spicy dip... i.e. jalapeno refried beans, sliced jalapeno layers over the (spicy)guacamole, instead of sour cream I did a jalapeno nacho cheese spread, topped it with a can of spicy rotel in place of the tomatoe and minced up jalapeno instead of the grean onion on top.... with all the jalapeno added it was not as spicy as it would seem it was a nice kick and everyone loved it :)

Brought this dish to a 4th of July party and everyone loved it. The dish was empty when I brought it home. Didn't add the green onions (don't really care for them) and left the olives on the side in case some didn't like it and all went well! Going in my cookbook for sure!

A favorite at several family potlucks. I always use a good organic brand of refried beans.. Also made my own taco seasoning  and just mix with sour cream, which cuts down on sodium. Everyone always asks for my recipe!

My 7 layered dip always lacked in taste and creaminess.  It never tasted like my friend's. Then I found out the secret ingredient was mayo!  It gives the sour cream and taco seasoning mixture a richer, creamier consistency.  Now I only make this version.  And I increase my mayo to  1/2 cup.  Everyone loves and raves about this dip. DO NOT OMIT THE MAYO...you will be disappointed!

It is great but I would definitely make some changes.  The taco seasoning would be omitted.  It has a strong taco taste in the sour cream.  I prefer the sour cream taste instead.  I also didn't use the mayo and added chopped fresh cilantro on the top.

As written, it was really good. A definite crowd pleaser.

I made this with homemade salsa in place of the tomatoes and added my own taco seasoning to fat free sour cream, and left out the mayo. Even better. 5 stars!

Replaced mayonnaise with 1 cup (8 oz) sour cream.  Since I used a deep dish pie pan increased a few of the ingredients:  1 cup sour cream, 2 tomatoes, 1 cup sliced black olives and 1 cup sliced green onion. Otherwise this recipe is great and my dinner group loved it.  DONEIL

Very good, I added lettuce. Bad mistake.  Made it very watery.

To those of you who don't love the mayo (which seems to be a lot of you) I have always made this with cream cheese. Just substitute the same amount of cream cheese for the mayo, and it's awesome! :)
