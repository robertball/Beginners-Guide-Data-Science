To accomodate our tastes, I cut down the onion to 1/2 cup, used one cup of monterey, 2 cups of sharp cheddar and eliminated the ketchup.  This dish came out great!

taste was acceptable but too much liquid seems like it needed thickening agent like cornstarch or something

This dish was fantastic!!  I didn't find myself with too much liquid at all.  Everthing came out just perfect!  I used a bit less cheese than the resipe called for but I think Worcestershire sauce is an amazing flavor enhancer to low fat cooking!!  I will definitely make this delicious recipe again.

A nice change from ordinary scalloped potatoes.  Just enough cheese, not so much that it's overwhelming.  The cook temp & time are perfect, and I didn't feel there was too much liquid as it had been absorbed or evaporated by the time it was ready to serve.  A very simple side dish.

This was okay.  I made no changes, except added some butter and salt, and found the ketchup/ worcestshire flavor to be strange.  It did turn out creamy, and baked down nicely, but the flavor just seemed strange and lacking something.

This was was excellent.  In my opinion, it is best using a good block of cheese, shredding it yourself, and even throwing in some fresh grated parm!

Didn't care for this.  The pink color of the juice next to the string of the cheese was unappetizing and the taste wasn't anything special.

We love this recipe have made it three times in the last month - twice for company.  Love the fact that the calorie and fat content is acceptable for those of us who are watching our weight.
