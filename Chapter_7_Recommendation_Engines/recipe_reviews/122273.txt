Everyone was skeptical that these would be dry because they were whole wheat, but we were pleasantly surprised by how light and fluffy they were. I served these with Creamed Cabbage Soup and it made a great meal.  **EDIT**  I just tried the "Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuit" recipe on this site and was unimpressed.  I looked at this one again and will use it from now on, though I will calculate the recipe to serve 12.  I didn't mention it in my original review, but I just used skim milk in place of the buttermilk and they were still outstanding.

This recipe does make a lovely sweet bicuit, but I found it  a tiny bit too sweet....I would 1/2 the sugar next time...and I also found I needed slightly more buttermilk than the recipe called for to make the dough moist enough to knead and roll.

I found the biscuits plenty moist enough.  Maybe some cooks did not roll them thick enough?  The recipe says to make the dough 1" thick before cutting.  That's ~2-1/2 cm. for you metric folk.  Also they should be checked after 18 min. rather than waiting the maximum 20.  Of course oven temp. accuracy is important, too.  Anyhow, cooked as per directions, they have just the right texture.  If you are using salted butter or margarine instead of sweet, omit the salt.  When I am out of buttermilk, I make a substitute by using 2 tsp. rice vinegar in the quarter cup before filling the rest w/ regular milk.  The acid in buttermilk or vinegar is necessary to make the baking soda work.  I also used only half the sugar and mixed it w/ the buttermilk instead of the dry ingredients to make it blend in better.  A tsp. or 2 of dried dill in the dry ingredients is nice once in a while.  Interesting that biscuit recipes are almost identical to most scone recipes except for the shape they are cut into.  One time I shaped this recipe the way I do scones--first shaping the dough into a thick log, then flattening it into a 3/4" thick rectangle, and scoring the rectangle into smaller rectangles which I then score on the diagonal into triangles.  The scored dough is not separated before baking.  This small recipe made 2 smaller rectangles--4 triangular "scones", and can be baked in a toaster oven if you keep a piece of foil loosely on top for 2/3 of the baking time.

This recipe makes a very moist and soft biscuit. It was a big hit with my family, and they are always asking me to make it. I do recommend doubling the recipe, as a single batch does not make many (double batch yields approximately 5-6 biscuits). I also found that you need to add more buttermilk than what the recipe calls for. Give it a try!

I have been making wholewheat biscuits for years.   Wholewheat flours differ hence you have to judge the amount of buttermilk.  This is a good basic recipe, but I would use less sugar.

What an easy recipe! This biscuit has a wonderful taste. I used my food processor (with a dough attachment) to combine my dry ingredients, butter and milk. Just pulsed until moistened. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar. The inside was light & fluffy just as the title implies. A great way to add more whole grain to your diet.

Man these were great for what I used them for. I used the dough to wrap nitrate free hotdogs in for the kids...I really liked using the whole wheat and all purpose together. They came out slightly sweet so if you don't want that I would leave out the sugar. But they made great piggys in blankets! kids LOVED them and so did I!

I added about 2-3 Tbps of low-fat buttermilk to the mix because I found it a bit to dry while trying to mix it.  I also cut the white flour in half, adding more whole-wheat flour. The result was great moist biscuits! very good recipe!

I have never made biscuits from scratch and just tried this recipe on a whim, and they are awesome! I used all whole wheat pastry flour (I don't even have white flour in the house) and subbed light butter to reduce the fat content.  I also used almond milk instead of buttermilk because that's what I had, and upon the suggestion of other users, reduced the sugar to 1 teaspoon. When I was mixing the butter in, I started getting a little worried because it wasn't getting crumbly like I expected it to, and seemed like mostly just flour with some little butter balls mixed in, but I went ahead and started adding the milk a tiny bit at a time and it worked out fine. By the time I got through mixing in the milk, it seemed to have the right consistency, so rather than roll it out on the counter, I just scooped it out and shaped it by hand, and they turned out perfect!!!! Of course a whole wheat biscuit does not taste exactly like a traditional version, but I prefer the whole wheat taste, so these were a definite winner for me. Next time I might add some bleu cheese crumbles and rosemary or cheddar and jalapenos. Looking forward to experimenting with this recipe.

I made these tonight to accompany my  French Onion with Garlic soup.  What a combination!  I doubled the recipe (except for the sugar) to accommodate a family of five, although we still only got one each with 2 left to share. I added dried cilantro, fresh finely chopped chives and a tablespoon of flax seeds which added a nice, healthy crunch.   Delicious!  Everyone loved them and I'll definitely be making these again.

I followed the recipe exact and found the flavor to be good, but the texture to be a bit grainy and crumbly instead of light and flakey...I think due to the whole wheat flour.

I love this recipe and make it often. The biscuits are soft, fluffy and moist. I substitute corn oil for the butter to make them healthier for me. I have doubled and tripled the recipe and made with all white or all whole wheat, each with great results!  Probably the best homemade biscuit I have ever made!

This recipe is very good.  I doubled the recipe and ended up having to add another 1/4 cup buttermilk to make the dough stick together.  I used a 2.5" biscuit cutter and got 8 biscuits.  They were a bit salty for my taste, so next time I will use half the salt.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and served them with honey - yum!

I've made this recipe a half a dozen times and its wonderful!  They remind me so much of my nana's biscuits that they will be a staple now.  

I've found, like others, that I'm using much more buttermilk than the recipe called for to get it all mixed but once it is it rolls out and cuts easily.

these turned out really dry for me.  I love to use whole wheat flour in things...but won't be trying these again.

2ND try - nice flavor, but really crumbly.  Family complained.

I just made these and they were excellent.  They were very tender.  The only problem is that it makes too few biscuits.  It only made enough for me.  :)  OK, I gave my room mate one.

These are extremely good for whole wheat biscuits! They turned out tender and light, even with half whole wheat flour. I made them exactly as written and wouldn't change anything about the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I personally liked these, though not my whole family didn't. Some of them said that they were a bit to dry and tasted very floury. My family LOVES the taste of whole wheat and I always make everything with WW flour, but this was a bit to much. I did all whole wheat flour and I do not suggest that!

I made these biscuits to top the chicken and biscuit casserole recipe from this web site.  The other recipe calls for a mix but I wanted something healthier.  It was a perfect recipe.  I doubled it and added dried rosemary and basil to the dough to match the flavours of the casserole.  They were light, sweet and savoury with the addition of the herbs!  I will use this recipe any time I need biscuits.  I'm sure you can jazz them up with whatever spices you like or make the recipe as is.

I really liked these. I did sub all whole wheat flour and milk for the buttermilk which I think made them just a bit more dry than they would have been but we still thought they were delicious. And somehow, even better the next day! Thank you!

These biscuits were perfect. Nice and flaky, with a good wheat flavor, yet not too dry. I was surprised that they were sweet with only 1 T. of sugar, so you could probably decrease that if you don't want them to be sweet.

Fluffy and moist! Loved them! Turned out better than my baking powder biscuits do. Put on top of my chicken and biscuits and it was great.

Awesome taste. I omitted the sugar, and used a baking mix instead of all purpose flour. I also used regular milk, because I didn't have buttermilk. I made extra biscuits and froze them for later.

I was really impressed with this recipe, they turned out great! Doubled the recipe and used skim milk and a little of lemon juice instead of buttermilk. Mixed everything in the food processor until just combined. Baked them for 15 minutes.

hate to be the person who just didn't like these but we just didn't like these...I made these exactly as the recipe stated except that I too had to double the recipe to feed 8 people, however I found the dough to be too dry it was hard to get it to stick together, the biscuits didn't rise they were flat...I did like the wheat taste so I will try some of the other wheat biscuit recipes found on this site but this one just won't be staying in our recipe book

I'm so happy to have found a healthy biscuit recipe! I haven't eaten biscuits in years, but after finding this, I will definitely be eating them a lot more! Deee-licious!

I followed the recipe and these ended up terrible - they were like rocks.  My husband wouldn't even eat them.  I have usually used a recipe with no baking soda and just baking powder, and a lot more of it; I think that's the difference.

These are very good! I tripled the recipe, decreased the sugar by 1/3 and added some wheat bran. I was feeling creative so I used my cookie cutters and made biscuits shaped liked ducks, bats, moose...etc. So fun! I served them veggie lasagna. Nice and buttery, thank you!

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly except I used unbleached bread flour instead of the regular all purpose.

These were great biscuits. I made this to serve 10 (I'll do 12 next time for easier measuring). I used less sugar and not really as much butter as it called for. Even then, I think all that butter made them too crumbly for normal biscuits. But they were GREAT with Sawmill Gravy on top!
