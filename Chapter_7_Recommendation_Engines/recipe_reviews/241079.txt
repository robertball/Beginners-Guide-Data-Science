It seems as though Chef John's recipes never fail in the flavor department and this one holds true to that belief. After making and tasting this I thought of so many ways I could use this. I finally stumbled upon Peppadew® peppers at my local market in the olive bar. I do believe that the Peppadew® peppers are a must in this recipe. Thank you Chef John for another outstanding recipe.
