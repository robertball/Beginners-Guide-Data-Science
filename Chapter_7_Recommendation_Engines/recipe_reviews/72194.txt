As a Texas girl living in Montana, I think many reviewers missed the point of what pulled pork is supposed to be. The meat is intended to have sauce added when placed on the bun. You want the smokey flavor of the pork (not all the spices). When you smoke a pork butt (or in this case, cooking it in the crock pot)the purpose is to get the pork very tender. You dress the pulled pork after its done with sauce, Jalape√±os, onions, swiss cheese, etc. This recipe is perfect for what it is intended to do--make the pork tender!

This recipe was an unbelievable hit at my daughter's graduation party. I did a trial batch with Sweet Babys Rays, and my hubby and I were not impressed. They were sampling "Cattlemen's" BBQ sauce at Sam's and we instantly knew that it was the sauce that would make my main course a huge hit. By the third batch I didn't bother browning the pork, onions, or garlic. Just throw it all in the crockpot and cook on high for 6 hours. The meat was so tender all I had to do was press it with a fork and it fell apart. I did not use the juices in the crockpot after the meat was cooked - it sounds like some did. I stirred the pork in Cattleman's and bagged it in ziploc freezer bags and froze for the big day. I let them set out overnight to defrost. I saved a quart of the juices in the fridge just in case I needed them to revive the pork, but it was not necessary at all so I discarded it. ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL!

Overall, very good if you like pulled pork. I didn't bother browning the pork first though. I seasoned it with "Cajun Seasoning Mix" from this site and added it to the slow cooker along with a bit of minced garlic. I left out the onion (personal perference when it comes to pulled pork). I've done a few "southern" pulled pork recipes and most call for cider vinegar vs. just water so I used 2 cups of apple cider vinegar and 2 cups of water. I let that go for 5 hours on low. I removed the meat and shredded it with two forks. I drained the liquid reserving 2 cups and put that back into the crock pot along with the shredded pork and then added 2 Tbsp. of liquid smoke. I also added a little brown sugar and cayenne pepper. I let that go for another hour on low. This is great topped with your favorite bbq sauce or try "White BBQ Sauce" from this site along with a side of coleslaw and cornbread!

This was really good (granted I adjusted it to suit my own preferences)- the meat came out very tender. The meat probably isn't flavorful enough to stand on its own and so should be made into sandwiches or add barbeque sauce (eta - smokey mesquite bbq sauce will probably be your best bet with this recipe). I made a couple adjustments for this - I used olive oil instead of butter for browning the meat and cooking the vegetables - a little healthier. I used less liquid smoke and added about 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce to the slow cooker. I also added a couple sprigs of fresh thyme and one sprig rosemary to the slow cooker and removed it after cooking. I also used 1 can chicken broth and 2 cups water for the liquid in the slow cooker to give it a little more flavor. For cooking time, I kept this in the slow cooker on high for about 2 hours and then lowered the heat for the remaining time and everything turned out really well. I used this for pulled pork sandwiches (on a kaiser roll, with a little apple cider vinegar, some texas pete hot sauce, and topped with restaurant-style cole slaw made from the recipe on this site). The sandwiches turned out really well!! As good as any I've had in the restaurants in the south. I'm not sure that I'd make this to eat without the coleslaw and hot sauce to add flavor or some sort of BBQ sauce, but it was the perfect recipe for the sandwiches.

I really think this is a 5 star recipe. I had to change it a little bit, but only because I could not find a boneless pork roast at my grocer. So I followed the recipe except that my meat was not cut up, I cooked it all on the bone. I used quite a bit more liquid smoke, also. My meat was so tender that it literally fell off of the bone and shredded by itself. lol It was pretty flavorful, but I added additional cajun seasoning and garlic to the meat after I shredded it. I served Jack Daniels BBQ sauce on the side. Great comfort food! Thanks for this recipe!!!

I wouldn't dare ruin this with barbeque sauce, but I did feel the liquid needed more flavoring. Instead of the water, I used beer and chicken broth. I also threw in some pepperoncini peppers with it's juice. My guests couldn't get enough at our dance recital party. Thanks!

Delicous! Cooked 8 hours on low, then added 1 bottle of gourmet BBQ sauce to cook another 2 hours. Everyone agreed as good as any BBQ restaurant! Served with Waldorf salad- perfect side with sweet, creamy, and crisp taste.

It needed more flavor so I added more liquid smoke, some honey & bbq sauce. It also needs to simmer longer for a better flavor

Excellent!  Very easy and delicious.  Highly recommend as a party entree if having a buffet.  We mixed in a bit of bbq sauce after we pulled it, then added to taste on the bun.  Teenagers loved it!

I used my own homemade cajun seasoning and I doubled the amount called for. I actually did what the recipe asked, I rubbed it on the roast before braising but I also sprinkled some over the ingredients in the crockpot before letting it go. Instead of water, I used beef broth. The boys ate this piled on hamburger buns with barbeque sauce while I ate mine as is (low carbin' it). Very VERY good. To say we loved this would be an understatement. I think using a homemade cajun seasoning was what made it so good (more flavor, less filler/salt) and the beef broth reallytook it over the top. This recipe's a keeper.

Cooking the pork this way kept it very moist and juicy, with a hint of smoke-y salt flavor.  You definitely need to put BBQ sauce on your sandwich, though.

I was really excited about making this given the reviews. However, I was so disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly. I put plenty of seasoning on the meat before browning, but the end result was bland shredded pork swimming in a pool of liquid. The directions said nothing about draining the liquid before returning the meat back to the crockpot after shredding it. Am I missing something?

Delicious!  Followed recipe except I put the onions on the bottom like someone suggested, and then mixed the rest of the ingredients together and poured it over the pork.  Cooked on high for 4 hours and low on 4 hours and the pork fell apart.  After shredding, I put the pork back in 1/2 the sauce mixed with some additional barbeque sauce.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks!

***Update 6 years later:  Still follow same recipe (using broth if I have on hand). Sometimes I do the first steps, but rather than slow cooking all day, I pack into jars and pressure can. Such a treat to have quick "slow roasted" pulled pork at a moment's notice. ****
 Definitely a keeper of a recipe!  The kids were head over heels for it.  I only made one change which was using chicken broth to cook it in, I would have used vegetable if I had it.  I didn't tweak any of the spices or other items and even put in the whole onion.  I have never cubed pork ahead of time, what a great method, the flavor was consistant throughout the meat. The flavor was incredible without any sauce.  (I used the cajun seasoning recipe from this site as well.)  We served it on potato buns with Sweet Baby Ray's.  The sauce worked with this recipe.  I would not change a thing.  I think the previous poster that pointed out this is the base recipe was spot on.  It is outstanding for that and will give you that pulled pork flavor and incredibly tender meat, like it has been on a grill all day.

These were VERY flavorful. The only thing we would change in the recipe is lessen the amount of Cajun seasoning.  We had 3 lbs instead of 2 lbs of pork roast, but still approx. halved the amount of Cajun seasoning, anticipating the saltiness. It still was WAY too salty for us. I could only handle having one sandwich, and so could my father (who usually packs food away!). So I will use just 1/4 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning next time.   Otherwise, fantastic recipe!

Heavenly!!!  Having lived in the south for 10 years previously, I was delighted to find this easy slow cooker recipe.  My husband raved and raved.  Will cut back on the liquid smoke next time though...a little strong and add a little Worchestershire sauce.  Great for leftovers and freezing too.

VERY tender! I omit the browning of the pork and go right to the crock pot, for simplicity. I also use more garlic and Cajun seasoning.  JEANETTEMT is spot on in that the idea is to make the pork TENDER, then add the sauce or extras thereafter. The flavor is absolutely able to stand alone. The review rating should be higher than 4.6!  This is the third time I've made this recipe. My family LOVES it!

I have made this recipe approximately 5 times and have always made it as written. The most recent time I made this dish I opted not to brown the meat or onion/garlic mixture. I just threw everything into the crockpot and let it cook. It turned out just as well as when I do brown the meat. I will continue to make this recipe, which I always pair with the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce that can also be found on AR.

This recipe was delicious!  The only changes I made were to use two cups of beef broth for my liquid and I used more liquid smoke.  I did not brown my meat beforehand.  I just cut it into small chuncks and put it in the crock pot with the onions, garlic, broth, cajun seasoning, and liquid smoke.  I cooked it on Low for about 6 hours, then took the meat out and shredded it and poured out some of the liquid, then placed it all back in the crock pot.  We made sandwiches from it topped with a little BBQ sauce (Cattlemens-Kansas City Classic) and some coleslaw.  However, I tasted the meat beforehand and it was tender and juicy and had a great flavor all on its own!  This is the best pulled pork recipe I have found!  Thanks, Brenda!

This is an absolutely AMAZING recipe.  This is even better than what our "famous" BBQ restaurant serves!  I skipped the browning of the meat as I don't see that it adds anything more to the end product.  And I also don't use all the water that is recommended.  I place the cut meat, rubbed with the spices, in the slow cooker, then following the recipe directions.  When the meat is done I hand pull the meat apart, put it back in the slow cooker and then add bbq sauce and let it cook a little longer until it's nice and hot.  I served this with "Down Home Baked Beans" from this site.  Those beans are also amazing!!  My husband is a firefighter and he brought this in for dinner one night and the boys went wild over it and they keep on asking for it.

This my first review.  I love this site and have been using it for many years.  I have tried many great recipes but I usually read a bunch of recipes and reviews and end up making my own version.  I have always made my pork BBQ in the crock pot, but never like this.  I followed this recipe exactly as it is written and it made the BEST pulled pork I have ever had anywhere!  The meat is the most tender, fall apart and juicy texture, you won't believe it!  It hardly needs BBQ sauce, it is perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this, I will never make it another way ever again!!!!

On its own I think the pork would be too bland, as other reviewers have said.  Having lived in Nashville a few years and wanting a pulled pork slathered in sauce (as I am used to) I made a couple of changes that made this very appetizing and reminiscent of smokehouses.  I kept everything in the preparation part of the recipe the same.  I used vidalia onions.  Instead of water I used 12 ounces of my favorite BBQ sauce and 12 ounces of a lager beer.  I used the same amount of the liquid smoke.  I started it in the slow cooker at breakfast time on high and four hours into it lowered it to low until dinner time.  With one hour remaining I pulled the pork apart so the sauce could saturate all of the pieces.  When it was finished I strained it and served it with a bottle of BBQ sauce on the side.  Very delicious!

I really appreciated the tip about not adding sauces etc until AFTER it's done. The recipe as written provides many burger type meals...or sloppy joe like meals.  A slice of cheese never was bad when melted over the PP when on the bun.  It freezes and reheats well to make a new fresh "bunned" meal anytime you want.
This just in...served this recipe as written at the annual family reunion gathering and it garnered the most positive responses ever. It's sooo easy and provides great results.  Don't tell anyone I slaved over a hot crock pot all day.  My childhood friend ate the leftovers later that evening. Definitely my "go to recipe". Keep in mind most of the popular BBQ sauces are sweetened w/ High Fructose Corn Syrup. So far I'm using Trader Joe's BBQ sauce sweetened w/ good old sugar.

This is an excellent recipe! As others before me have noted, this is one that you should add your sauce to when serving, as "true" pulled pork is. We used a whole pork sirloin (much less fat), and browned on the gas grill to start, and finished the next day in the crock pot- it was melt-in-your-mouth tender, shredded with no effort, and both of my picky kids DEVOURED it. Altogether, a wonderful, easy recipe, and just great for a workday, with very little prep! Thanks so much, BRENDASUM! :o)

Delicious, exactly what I was looking for. Used with Big Al's K.C. BBQ sauce recipe on this site and it was to die for.

I have made this recipe several times and it turns out PERFECT every time. Do yourself a favor and do not alter anything. It is very easy and is delicious. I recently made 65lbs. for a grad party and it was gone quick. Thanks for sharing. 25 STARS

I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it was a hit every time!  The only thing I do different is to use low sodium beef broth instead of water or if I'm out of beef broth, I dissolve some beef boullion in the water to give it more flavor.  Once it's shredded, I add Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  Try some horseradish on your sandwich or top it with some cole slaw!

I made this for the 4th of july block party and didnt get many compliments i followed it exactly to the T and i dont think it had much flavor..next time i wont use the liquid smoke..didnt like the the flavor or smell.  meat was very tender and looked nice but that was it! Definetly not a 5. Oh and add every bit of the water it calls for it does need it or it will be to dry.

We were recently in GA and enjoyed the pulled pork bbq. I was looking for an easy recipe with the same type of flavor and came across this recipe.  It is very easy and very good!! I've made it twice!

I made this and my husband says this was one of THE best meals I have ever made. He loved it. I served it on soft rolls with bbq sauce. I substituted water with chicken stock for more flavor and served it with fresh coleslaw.

I've been using this recipe for several years now, it's my go to for pulled pork.  I DO NOT always brown my meat before placing in the crock pot, it really depends on how busy I'am that day.  Both methods work well and give excellent results.  When it's done we just pull the meat apart and add whatever sauce/condiments we desire..Very Tasty.

If you want the best -- the best -- pulled pork sandwich, you've got to use this recipe along with two other recipes from this site:  Restaurant-Style Coleslaw and Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce.  They are way better than any restaurant could hope to make!  Do not let the amount of liquid smoke scare you; it's just flavor in your mouth.  If you want to skip the bun, serve it over rice with the sauce and slaw on the side.

Delicious flavorful and moist! I had to make my own Cajun seasoning (recipe from this site) and to my horror, I had run out of cayenne pepper. I substituted it with chipotle chili pepper which turned out incredible. I also doubled the spices and increased the liquid smoke. We will use this recipe for a variety of dishes in the future.
Huge hit in a recovering vegetarian household. Enough said!

Cut the liquid in half and used beef broth instead of water.  It was so tender and juicy after cooking all day in the slow cooker.  This was delicious served on buns with BBQ sauce.

I made this for dinner today...my family loved it! I  skipped the browning in butter part. I seasoned the pork with southwest chipotle seasoning(what I had on hand), also used a bit more liquid smoke. I wrapped the seasoned pork in foil and placed in crockpot.I put enough water in crockpot to cover the bottom. Cooked on low overnight. It turned out perfect! Thanks for sharing!

FANTASTIC! My kids loved it, my husband loved it, I loved it! I didn't have any cajun seasoning, so I used a pork rub that I had in my cabinet which had a little bite without being super spicy. I also used a pork tenderloin instead of a roast. Again, it happened to be what I had in the fridge. This was lovely without any barbecue sauce but would be easy to dress with it afterwards if you are inclined. I served it on crusty kaiser rolls with pickles and it was delicious. My mouth is watering again just thinking about it. We will definitely be having this one again.

SO easy & SO good!  I can't believe I made this at home!  I felt like I was eating at one of our favorite BBQ joints!  I served this for Easter & we all thought it was great!  This one's a keeper for sure!  Thanks for posting!  Oh & I didn't brown my meat as per another reviewers suggestion.  We served with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (our personal favorite)!

This is great pulled pork. I used just a little bit more liquid smoke than the recipie called for, and I added a few tsps of BBQ sauce into the mix. Other than that I followed the recipie exactly.  The pork was juicy and tender and very flavorful even before the addition of BBQ sauce on top.  Easy to make, and very tasty! 5 stars!

I made and froze this ahead of time for a light supper for out of town guests the evening following our daughter's wedding. It heated back up in my crockpot with plenty of moisture retained. We put it on inexpensive hamburger buns and topped it with ample Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. I couldn't believe the rave reviews I got. "How'd you do it?!"

Absolutely loved this! I put everything straight into the crock pot without browning. The shoulder roast was so tender that it fell into pieces after 5 hours when I tried to remove it. Will be using this recipe again for sure!

I made this for a white elephant party potluck.  It was fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  The pork was wonderfully tender with a great flavor.  I served it on smalle slider buns with BBQ sauce and coleslaw as toppers.

Excellent recipe, and one of the only ones on this site that doesn't use barbecue sauce. I was surprised how flavorful the meat was for how little seasoning went in. I would definitely make this again. I checked the meat after 4 hours on high and it was done. So easy and good!

Have to go along with the TX gal in Montana - you dress up pulled pork on the bun - and this recipe is perfect. Only potential adjustment - less water.

Thanks!

Yes, I get that this recipe is to be served with sauce. Id give more stars if it included a recipe for an exceptional sauce, but my guinea pig meat-eater said the meat on its own needed a little extra seasoning. We added McCormick Grill Mates Pork Rub, seasoning salt, pepper, a dash of garlic powder. He says it was decent and not as bland AFTER our modifications. As for the sauce, we simmered Hines ketchup, Pace picante sauce, Mesquite seasoning, smoked paprika, and Kraft Original BBQ sauce, yellow mustard, and a splash of Budweiser for half an hour. The meat did come out fork-tender and juicy. Just needed a lil extra flavor.

Cook time is way off. Even with all the liquid, the meat was dry. Unless you're a huge fan of Carolina BBQ, do NOT sub 2 cups of cider vinegar for the water. All you will taste is vinegar and the meat will be useless as leftovers for anything else.

Great to come home after being gone all day and smell this terrific recipe cooking in the crock pot.  I just put it all in together as some other reveiwers had stated, and it was fantastic.  Next time I will increase the smoke flavor, and decrease the cajun flavor for something different, but there will be a repeat appearance of this one - very good -thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a crowd pleaser. It satisfied the BBQ lovers and those that are not. I did not have cajun seasoning so I made up my own and it worked out just fine. I too used chicken broth instead of water and the pork was able to stand on its own with flavor. Will make it again and again.

Turned out perfect.  I substitued 2 cups of the water for 2 cups (16oz) of beer.  I am a homebrewer, and I used my Homebrewed American Amber Ale that I had on tap.

This was my very first time making a roast and it was AMAZING!!  My boyfriend and dad both ate 2 sandwiches for dinner and then had 2 again the next day lol.  It smelled delicious all day long in my house while it was cooking :) I did however change one thing - I used beef broth instead of water.  Only because I had some in the cupboard and I felt like it would be weird if I used plain water when I had broth on hand...and it could only make it tastier :) YUMMMMMMYY!!!

Excellent 5 star's, I agree with the last review, the reviewers missed the point of Southern pulled pork.  Being from AZ, I set out various bottles of  southwest hot sause, horseradish and bbq sauces on the side. Also added more Liquid smoke. My pork had bone in. So I set my slow cooker on low and by dinnertime the tender meat was falling off the bone. Great for large parties!

I haven't fixed this yet but am giving it 5 stars just because it's NOT stewing the meat in BBQ sauce all day like so many slow cooker recipes. I love BBQ pork just by itself and if it's good meat, done right, a lot of sauce is not needed. Just smear a little sauce on the bun or sprinkle a little hot sauce on the meat, add a little bit of good slaw and enjoy. BTW if you can find it try BONE SUCKING SAUCE and their dry rub of the same name, great on ribs and chicken too.

Love it!!! It makes the meat so tender, shredding it always sounded lie a pain work to me but this makes it a swoosh! Haven't yet gotten to make this recipe all from scratch as in here as I had pre-spiced pork roast in my Angel Foods Ministry box. but the pre-spiced part sounded a lot like the spices require in this recipe. will do this any time again! This is great and especially on hot and busy summer days or football/ big get togethers. As you do not have to fire up the oven and it leaves you lots of time for other things. YUM YUM YUMMY!

This was amazing! I will now always make my own pulled pork! Easy and wonderful. It was done an hour early and I cooked 2 1/2 lbs of meat. Next time I am going to double the recipe and make sure we have some left overs. I did not use the liquid smoke flavoring as we do not like that taste but like I said, it was still amazing!

Jeanette is right, smoked pork has a flavor all it's own and should be complemented with spices and condiments after cooking. This recipe does give you very tender meat so don't be afraid to cook it alone and add flavors later, plus it opens up different variations for different tastes. I also suggest putting a big spoon of coleslaw right on top of your sandwich mmmmmmmmmmm.

I switched it up a bit, and used some emerils essence for the  seasoning.  I also added some sweatness to it.  Instead of 4 cups of water I did 2 cups and then added 2 cups of apple cider.  The sweetness and the smokiness pair each other well.

So easy!  I followed the recipe exactly as written but added a little salt half way through the cooking and covered each chunk of meat in cajun instead of using just a Tbl spoon.  I read some other reviews and it states to reduce the liquid in half.  I don't recommend doing so as the meat soaked up a lot of the liquid after I shredded it. It was just the right ratio of liquid to meat.  Very juicy, but the bun soaked up most!  I didn't put sauce on mine, but a few of the others did.  6 hours of cooking time is perfect, but if it goes a little longer that's not a problem.  As I cooked mine for about 7 hours and the meat was just as moist and juicy!  Thank you for the recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is very very good and is sooo easy to make.  I love the broth.  I season the pork very well with Tony's cajun seasoning.  Instead of water I did a combination of beer, beef broth, worcestershire, and the liquid and peppers  from jar of pepperoncini's The broth at the end  of the cooking time is sooo good and really spicy    I'm planning to make 3 meals from this.   The first being a sandwich on a Hawaiian roll served with shoestring fries, the second with jasmine rice using the gravy/sauce  the pork makes and the third using the meat to make quesadillas.  YEAH,  IT'S THAT GOOD.

This is a perfect recipe.  I have made it twice.  The first time I made it as-is minus the Cajun seasoning and added my own bbq sauce at the end.  It was so good.  The second time, I cooked it as-is, again minus the cajun seasoning, and in about four hours the meat was so delicious we wouldn't dream of adding the bbq sauce.  We toasted hamburger buns and ate the pulled pork with provolone cheese.  Perfection.  I'm not sure but I really think the liquid smoke is what makes this dish!

This was a great recipe.  It was so simple.  This creates a nice smoky pork with nothing fancy, no unexpected flavors.  My husband is usually disappointed with pulled pork, as the BBQ sauce is usually overpowering for him.  He loved this pork as-is with just the smoky flavor; I put BBQ sauce on mine.  We both thought it was the best pulled pork we have tried.  We will certainly make this again - it will be great at summer get-togethers.

This was fantastic pulled pork. It was seriously so tender that when I went to take it out of slow cooker it fell apart at the touch of a tong. I would agree with a few other people that it needs bbq sauce. I used olive oil instead of butter. I added a Jalapeno with the onion and garlic. I used 2C of water and 1 (14.5 oz) can of beef broth. Other people commented about the amount of liquid. I found that it didn't matter, as I strained the liquid off. I also added a tsp of hot sauce. I left on high for 6 1/2 hours, then added 1 bottle of BBQ sauce on low for 30 min. I made "zesty coleslaw" from this site. I then piled bbq and slaw on top of kaiser roll and got my eat on! I will witout a doubt make this again.

My family and I love this recipe. it was super easy and tasted better than any BBQ we've gotten at a resturant. I am making it again this weekend for a family gathering. This recipe has earned a spot in the front of my cookbook.  We used Emiril's Cajon spices and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce

this lacked the flavor I was expecting. I think I would try it again with a lot less water. The amount of water seemed to dilute the flavor too much. Otherwise, the meat was very tender.

(I'm always amused when someone changes the recipe, such as adding cider vinegar, then gives it a bad review)  If you read the intro, it says to add your favorite BBQ sauce.  I use Sweet Baby Rays, but I tastes will vary so I didn't specify which brand to use.  

There seems to be some confusion regarding this recipe.  

You ARE suppose to drain the liquid before adding any BBQ sauce.  The amount of liquid is 4 cups because you want your pork to be tender and juicy, not dried out.  You can reserve a little of the liquid so that after you drain you add some back in if needed.  

I'm glad to see that most of you are enjoying the recipe as much as I enjoyed creating it :) Thanks all for your compliments and critiques!

I was a little worried about so much water but filled the crock pot anyway.  I used heaping Tbs of cajun spice because we like spicy.  I trimmed the fat and pulled the pork and by this time the day was done.  I put enough of the juices from the crock pot to fill the container I had the pulled pork in, put it in the reefer and went to bed.  I tried a few bites the next day and the pork seemed dry (even with the liquid overnight).  Hmmmm...what to do?  We were going to put our favorite BBQ sauce on it but by leaving the liquid in I knew it would be way too watery...sooooo, I poured out the liquid, put the pulled pork in a pot, heated it up and poured a bottle of our favorite BBQ sauce on it and let it heat through (Trader Joe's All Natural BBQ Sauce).  Stirred it throughly and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!  It was the best darned pulled pork my husband and I have ever had!

This is an absolutely excellent recipe. I followed the advice of one poster and added some Cider Vinegar (just a cup to 3 cups of water), but I think it was too much. The next time I make this, I will cut back the vinegar to just a tablespoon and reduce the water to 3 cups. Otherwise, just great. I paired with bottled barbecue sauce on the side for those that wanted it.

I loved this recipe.   I had never made pulled pork before, so was a little nervous to try.  It was super easy to make and came out super delicious!

Found it to be a little spicy. Maybe my cajun seasoning was too strong. But otherwise great recipe.

I tried this a couple of times and it just didn't seem like what pulled pork is suppose to taste like. It's just a pork butt stired in watered down cajun seasoning. Won't try again.

I didn't brown the pork first (I dont see the point, if you're using a slow cooker)  I just put the roast in whole with all the ingredients and let it cook.  If you get a fattier cut of pork (like a butt roast) you don't need all that water either.  I think I only used 1 cup of chicken broth for extra flavor.  After cooking, I removed the fat and shredded the meat, I still thought it could use some extra seasoning, so I added some extra cajun seasoning to the shredded meat.  It was great.

Awesome flavor. I will say that 4 cups of water is not needed, I actually cooked it on low all night and then left top off for hours on high to cook out the liquid. Was perfect once the water cooked down. Next time will use 1 cup water. The kick was perfect!

This was really a 3 star, but that is my fault for using the cider vinegar suggested by some of the other reviewers.  That was the overpowering flavor.  But since that was my error, I am giving it 4 starts.  Meat was very moist and very easy to shred.  I do think next time I will add more smoke flavor,  Will definitely try it again with NO vinegar!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make and so fabuous to eat! I followed the recipe to a "T". Once done added some pulled pork to a skillet with my favorite bbq/pulled pork sauce and fried for about 5 minutes before serving. Left overs were great too! While warming it up in the microwave at work, half the employees came to find out what smelled so good!

It was perfect for what we wanted it. I used it to make pulled pork tacos. Inspired by tacos I had at a little hole in the wall place, I topped them with pico de gallo, cheese and remoulade (sp?) sauce. leftovers we used for sandwiches, and made a quesadilla with a little bbq sauce and cheese and dipped in salsa Verde. They were all very tasty!

Very moist and tasty. I browned my meat but forgot to season it with the cajun seasoning so I just added it to the pot. It adds a nice spice to it. I cooked mine around 5 hours and it was ready. I am not going to brown mine as long next time.

I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used a meat rub that I had on hand and I added a lot more garlic but maybe only 3 cups water. I did keep the onoin bits in with the pork for sandwhiches and it was great. Also is very nice served on cheesey kieser rolls.

This recipe did make the pork tender and very easy to shred. The only thing I did differently was cook this in a dutch oven on the stove top. I think it was a different flavor than what I was looking for. When the pork was done, it just tasted a little off, so I tried to doctor it, and  I added some extra spices and BBQ sauce. It ended up better, I couldn't get it to taste quite like I wanted, so I will continue to search. It was okay, but I won't make it again.

Very easy, especially since I just tossed it all in the crockpot (no working kitchen at the moment).  Tasted fine, but not enough seasoning for me.  I had to add bbq sauce on my sandwich.

Great Recipe but I did tweak it after reading some other reviews. I sauteed the onion and garlic and braised the meat while the onion and garlic were cooking. I then added 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water to add more flavor. I then added chipotle barbeque sauce to the liquid in the crock pot. Other than that I did everything else the same. Easy and so yummy.

I thought this was simple and great.  I wanted a good basic recipe for pork tacos, and this definitely fit the bill.  To boost the taco flavor, I opted to add two chipotles in adobo, chili powder, cumin, and mexican oregano instead of the cajun seasoning.  I would also use this for pulled pork sandwiches...I agree with another reviewer that the whole point of the basic recipe is to allow you to add whatever sauce (sweet, vinegar, etc) AFTER the pork is finished and tender.  That way, everyone can be satisfied regardless of their BBQ heritage!

Very easy to make and fed 10+ people easily.  Everyone including the kids loved it.  For the Cajun seasoning, I used Cajun Spice mix on this site by Bobbie Jean.

I just finished eating this and my whole family LOVED it.  The only change I made was to use maybe 1/2 tbsp of liquid smoke and that was because I wasn't sure if we would like it the taste of it.  We added BBQ sauce on top and topped that off with a bit of cole slaw and I was back home in East Tennessee!!  Can't wait to use the leftovers!

Awesome recipe. I added about 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce to the pork after I shredded it and put it back in the crock pot for about an hour on low. AMAZING!!!!!

Perfect!  The meat  is so tender and falvorful.  I normally eat pulled pork with barbecue sauce, but that would only take away from this recipe.

This smelled SO good while it was cooking!  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I found a recipe for it here on AR and used that one.  I used KC Masterpiece on it tonight and tomorrow I'm going to try Sweet Baby Rays.

very moist and tender. I used 3 cups of water instead of 4 and next time I'll probably use 2 1/2 cups. I served on rolls with bourbon glaze from Tastefully Simple. I should have added onions and peppers to the sandwich for extra flavor.

Yummy!  I used only a 12 oz can of beer (root beer might substitute) instead of the water & liquid smoke.  It is tender in 3 hours & there is just enough liquid in the pot to keep the meat moist for sandwiches. We added our favorite BBQ sauce & everyone devoured this quickly!

My husband LOVES this recipe.  He even takes the leftovers to work and brags about the great pulled pork I make.  After cooking the pork, I drain out the water, shred, and add Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar (more mellow and sweet than the Original SBR) to taste, then let it look in the crock pot for another 1/2 hour.  Delicious!

Flavor was nice. I was concerned about the meat being too greasy if I returned it to the pot with all the liquid, so I drained it out. This of course, made it a little dry. It just seems like the pork would be swimming in liquidy fat. Any suggestions?

For my crock pot, 4 cups of water was WAY too much liquid!  As a result, I lost alot of the flavoring with the excess water I had to drain.  I concur with some of the other posters here when they say to mix in some BBQ sauce towards the end.  Otherwise, this is an EXCELLENT alternative for those who do not have the means with which to properly slow cook pork.

Gave this 4 stars because I did change it a little.. instead of just using water I used a can of beer and 2 cups of chicken broth.  I also added 2 Tb of worcestershire sauce and skipped the browning- just put everything into the slow cooker.  Cooked it on high for 3 hours and low for an additional 6 hours. I used a 5.5 lb pork shoulder.  It was absolutely DELICIOUS.. I don't even like pulled pork and I couldn't get enough of it!!  I will definitely make this again.. probably often.

I really liked this. The flavor is distinctly bbq but very subtle.    I also think it's well worth the trouble to cut up the meat and brown it along with the onion and garlic -  It definately adds more flavor.    Serve on buttered/grilled rolls so the juices don't make the sandwich soggy.  Definately want to add your favorite bbq sauce - but not too much to overpower the meat.   This would be a wonderful inexpensive dish to serve to a crowd.

Great recipe. I seared and cooked the roast w/o cutting it into chunks and it stayed moist. I also added stewed tomatos, some Allegro marinade and some barbecue sauce to the onions and garlic and then added it to the slow cooker.  This was an amazing recipe. I took the broth, strained it, and allowed it to reduce on the stove making a fantastic au jus for the meat.  Really good.

I LOVE pulled pork (and any other BBQ, I'll admit!) and I have to say this was THE best pulled pork I have ever eaten in my LIFE!!! I used a 3 parts Sweet Baby Rays 1 part Stubbs Original sauce mixture for a nice sweet/tangy combo, awesome!

Loved this recipe! I was in a huge rush so I skipped the pan and tossed all ingredients into the crock pot...turned out delish! Although, I will add a touch more seasoning next time...salt and more cajun shake.

Good. I couldn't decide between this and the other crockpot pulled pork recipe on this site, so I did a hybrid of the two. Instead of water, I did one cup of root beer and one cup of beef broth (I had a small pork tenderloin, didn't need that much liquid). I just tossed everything into the pot. Very good recipe.

This was by far the best pulled pork recipe I've tried at home. My husband loved it too and that's saying alot because he's picky. Didn't change a thing. We ate with & without B-b-q sauce and it was great both ways. Try it!

Unbelievably tender!  My store was having a sale on boston butt roasts - 99 cents a pound! - and I found this recipe.  Oh wow - the meat seriously melts in your mouth!  I followed the recipe exactly, when the meat was done it was falling apart that I had to use a spoon to get it out of the crockpot - I shredded it, dumped the water out, returned the meat to the crockpot, added barbeque sauce and set it on "keep warm" until dinner.  Absolute perfection!  For the seasoning, I actually used "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site.  This is going in our recipe box as a keeper!  Thanks so much!

This recipe was pretty good. I am not much of a pork fan. The liquid smoke flavor was really strong in the house, and it made me a little sick, but the taste of the pork was good. We toasted the buns a little so that they wouldn't get as soggy when we put the pork on. The pork was really tender!

Very Good. I like this recipe. Of course as most cooks like to do is adjust a tad bit to what sounds good to themselves. I had to put some minced garlic, use a little less liquid smoke and just had to have BBQ sauce. But it's a nice recipe that most will like I'm sure. The meat comes out nice if done like this recipe suggests. One other thing is I like to shred the pork and then let it sit in the slow cooker juices for about a half hour or so to absorb more flavor of whatever you put in it.

This was delicious. I cooked the meat on the stovetop the night before and stored in the crock pot over night in the fridge. Then before work the next day, I added the liquid smoke and turned on the crock pot for the day. An hour before serving we added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. The sandwiches are delicious!

I was kind of disappointed. The meat is tender and does fall apart nicely, but the flavor is really lacking. Definitely needs BBQ sauce but even then not my fave. I won't make again.

I was very unhappy with the results.  I followed directions exactly but my family said it was pretty much tasteless until they covered the pork with BBQ sauce.  The meat was tender, however.  I will be removing this recipe from my recipe box.

My family loves this recipe! I make it for large parties or slow-moving family Sundays. It has never failed to please even the pickiest of eaters. I follow the recipe to the last letter and have always found success. Thanks to the recipe contributor!

This recipe is great. I did make one substitution; instead of 4 cups of water I used 2 small cans of pineapple juice (12 ozs. total). This really adds a huge amount of flavor to the recipe and reduces the liquid to just the right consistency.

I've made pulled pork in the crock-pot many times in many different ways, some more successful than others.  This is up there in my top two favorites. It was a hit with the hubby too. It works really well for when you are serving to people who don't agree on sauce because it is not cooked in any so I can have my spicy southern and my husband can have his mustard based.

What a treat! I followed the recipe as directed, except for scaling up the ingredients as I used a bigger (6-lb) roast. Even with a large roast, 4 cups water was waaay too much. However, after cooking, I divided the extra liquid - froze some for making gravy for other meals, and thickened some with cornstarch to mix with the pork instead of using BBQ sauce.  The meat is very tender and nicely seasoned - a big hit with DH who called it a "top 10" recipe for sure! Will be making this often. Thank-you Brenda for a wonderful recipe.

Wow, wow, wow. This recipe is fantastic. It's a classic pulled pork not meant to be cooked in sauce. The smokey pork flavor is incredible. I just made this for super bowl and it was a hit! I tried plain and with a homemade tangy BBQ sauce. Great both ways, however, I think I ate most of it straight out of the crock pot :) I washed it down with a really hoppy IPA which complimented the pork really well. Oh ya, i think it's actually better the next day. Shred pork and let it sit in fridge for a day if you have time.

Great recipe just as it is.  We don't need to go to the local bbq place any more according to hubby.  Next time might add a bit more liquid smoke, but was delicious as is!

A-MA-ZING!!! My whole family loves this! I made up my own dry rub (instead of using the cajun seasoning) with garlic powder, coarse salt, dry mustard, paprika and a touch of cayenne. Delish!

Perfectly cooked meat!  I used the pork butt cut of meat.  I changed up the recipe slightly - didn't use butter or brown in skillet, instead I put everyting in the crock pot as another review recommended.  I used the cajun seasoning, garlic, and some pepper and rubbed on the meat before placing in the crock pot with onion.  I prepared everything except for the water and liquid smoke the night before so I could just add those ingredients in the morning when I left for work.  When I got home it was done.  I then drained the stock, pulled the pork, returned to crock pot and added bbq sauce, red pepper flakes, and hot sauce (personal preferences, but plain bbq sauce can work).  I let the flavors mix in a bit and served on onion rolls, perfect!

yummy!  after a few days this was too spicy for me, but definitely a good alternative to traditional bbq pulled pork.  Also was too soggy when i shredded and returned to the sauce (which i did to allow it to soak in flavor)

Phenomenal!  Made with two 2 lb pork roasts, but kept the other seasoning measurements just about  the same.  We topped ours with bbq sauce and coleslaw.  Tasted just like the pulled pork sandwiches we used to eat from a mom and pop bbq restaurant we used to visit in Southern Illinois when I was a kid.  This will be made again and again in our home.

made this recipe for a large party using 14 lbs of pork tenderloin and pork roast.  made it in two batches in a large crock pot adding water to come up 2/3 of the way in the crock pot.  added extra liquid smoke after the first batch for personal preference.  meat was so tender it fell apart just pressing on it.  added some of the juice back into the meat and left the entire batch plugged into a "keep warm" crock pot all day.  Just set different flavored sauces around the meat and people made there own sandwiches to how they prefer.  Carribean Jerk and Famous Dave's Devil's Spit sauces went over really well with it.  Lots of compliments.

This was so delicious! I used less water and added a little vinegar to the crock pot, and more Liguid Smoke to suit my taste.  The stove top prep makes it so much better than throwing it all in the pot.Thanks for posting!

this was awesome!  I didn't do the skillet fry - I put everything in the slow cooker and let it cook as instructed.  I might try it with cole slaw like the other review commented.

Made this for a fund raiser serving 150 people... it was a big hit with many people asking for the recipe!  Love the fact that I could adjust the serving amount on this site!  Adjustments I made were cooking the day before.. letting the pork sit lightly sauced over night and reheating with more sauce at the time of serving.  Very tender flavorfull meat!

Wonderful! I used 1 cup of cider vinegar in the place of one of the cups of water. I have one of the old crock pots that doesn't get as hot as the new ones, so I'll cut down the liquid to 2 cups next time. For now, I'll use that delicious juice to make some soup!

Just made this for the first time.  It came out great.  I made it exact to the recipe.  Only problem was I think it called for too much water.  It needed to be drained first, and you know some of the best flavoring just went down the drain.  Will make again adding some of my own touches to it.

This is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly as written. I was happy to find southern pulled pork as good as any restaurant in NC right in my own kitchen.  You won't know it wasn't smoked in a smoker.

My husband and I are very picky about our pulled pork, but this was awesome!! With some Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce it was sooo good. I made it for his birthday and we had his family over and it was G-O-N-E in a flash! Mmmmm...I'm actually making it again right now as I type. :-)

I was not overly impressed with this.  It was good for sandwiches with bbq sauce on it.  It didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would.

Loved by the entire family.  The cooking process was easy.  Only a few minutes to prep with the browning process and then spent the day in the crockpot.  Instead of the cajun seasoning, I just used our fav seasoning instead.  I actually had a very lrg pork roast and filled 2 crocks.  On to the freezer with what we didn't eat for additional meals.   Meat was moist and fell apart.  Delicious!

We have used both pork and beef for this recipe and love it.  We have had with a little too much spice and then with just enough for the kids.  They love it too.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.  It does just fall apart.

Loved this recipe - cooked it on low for 8 hours.  Did not taste much of the Cajun although the smoke came thru nicely.  next time, we added another TBL of Cajun and it was just lightly seasoned and perfect.  Great recipe. Served with BBQ sauce and banana pepper rings and B&B pickles.... yum.....definitely a keeper!

The pork turned out nice & moist - I used 2 cups of water to draw out the drippings from the skillet, and then added about one more as I wanted to just cover the meat in the slow cooker. Would have given it 5 stars except the pork was a bit bland - but as a result each person simply had the chance to customize it to their heat & sauce preference (an easy fix). I cooked it on high for 3 hours & on low for 3 hours - the pork was cut into approx. 3 inch chunks. For those who work all day I would imagine that putting it on low for 7-8 hrs. would work perfectly. Will make again!

Like many people the amount of water freaked me out.  I used 1 cup and feel like it was perfect.  I served this at a party and everyone seemed to love it.  You simply cannot appreciate this recipe without the liquid smoke so don't forget it when you go shopping.  ;)

I tripled the recipe and used about 6 pounds of pork.  I discarded the juice and used a hickory smoke barbeque sauce.  My husband is not a  fan of barbeque, but raved about the sandwiches.  Excellant for football parties!

one of the posters mentioned making it more of a north carolina version and used hot pepper vinegar as the sauce. personally, while good, i never was able to actually "taste" the pork when i lived in n.c. and ate their's. probably has a lot to do w/what you grow up with, i imagine. this recipe is also good using venison roast! of course, it's a different thing entirely but came out wonderful! my small change is the same as some of the other posts - the sauce was added as needed/desired on top and not in the cooker. thank YOU!

I'd much rather have N. Carolina BBQ with no tomato-based BBQ sauce used.  Instead, after the pork is slow cooked (with no butter, Cajun seasoning, onion or garlic), it is put on a bun then hot pepper vinegar sauce is liberally sprinkled on top. The slaw should be on the side, not top of the pork in the sandwich.  Many restaurants outside of NC serve the slaw on top.  That's not traditional.  Neither is the slow cooker, but it's still a great idea for making small amounts easily at home. That's the way I do pork (with onions, garlic & green chiles) for fillings in Mexican dishes. A Tbs. of liquid smoke is waaaaay too much!  Only maybe a 1/4 tsp. is necessary.  I wouldn't even bother to brown the meat in a pan before placing it in the slow cooker for this type of recipe. Still tastes wonderful and skips an unnecessary step.

This recipe resulted in the best meal ever made in the crock pot!!!!!! It exceeded all my expectations. I followed the recipe, but didn't have liquid smoke and cooked on low for 8 hours. It did just fall apart while taking it out to shred. This is definitely a keeper!!!!

I was really looking forward to making this recipe, but I was disappointed in the results. The liquid smoke stunk up the entire house while it was cooking and the smell was overwhelming. The end product didn't have a ton of flavor, which was surprising. I had to add BBQ sauce to my sandwich, which I didn't originally plan on doing. I used 2 cups of water instead of 4, and it still seemed like too much.  However, the pork was very easy to shred, and I'll probably make it again but add less liquid smoke and more spices.

I've taken this dish to a few sick relatives and my sister and brother-in-law who are new parents over the last couple of months and it's been a huge hit. It's easy to serve and goes great with sweet or sandwich rolls, bagged salad and baked beans. I've made it as written and also without onions or liquid smoke but added half a bottle of bbq sauce when done and it's been great both ways.

This is very good but added fresh rosemary and thyme.  Used olive oil instead of butter.  Cut liquid smoke to 1/2 tab and added Worcestershire 1 tab. Added 1 tab. vinegar and 1/8 cup brown sugar.  After I shreaded pork I added my favorite BBQ sauce, approx. 1/2 to 3/4 bottle to slow cooker.  It turned out great!  Now these changes made it a 5 star!

First i'll say that i've been turned off of crockpot pork because of the greasiness and texture.  BUT, this was very easy and sooooo good!  My son was craving pulled pork and money was tight.   I picked up the least expensive small pork roast I could find.  I think I paid just over $4 for 3+ lbs.  I figured it'd be lousy since it was so cheap.  I trimmed as much fat as I could off of it and it came out SO GOOD!  The best pulled pork i've eaten. I did omit the onions, but did the rest exactly as written.  I had a bag of multigrain Pita Chips in the pantry and tried it on one of those and now i'm HOOKED!  What a great appetizer it would make on pita chips!  I added about a 3rd to half a bottle of sweet barbeque sauce after I drained it (left about 2/3 c liquid).  Thanks so much for restoring my faith in pulled pork! :) **Update** (original review 2009), I still make this, but i don't bother browning the meat, and I don't add all that water.  I only add about a cup with chicken or beef bouillon mixed in.  I make my own cajun seasoning and sprinkle that all over the roast (after I trim as much fat as I can),  add the bouillon/water and garlic (no onions). After cooking, drain all but about a cup of the liquid, add bbq sauce to the meat, and as much liquid as I need to get it just saucy enough.  Still reeeeally good.

Omg this turned out perfect! I cooked this last weekend. The only things I did differently was  follow some of the other reviews and used less water/broth. I used about 2 cups. I do think if you had an oblong slow cooker 4 cups would be a good fit. My partner loved this pork and I will be cooking it for a work pot luck very soon. I served it on buns but also just on Texas toast. I know a lot of the reviews say it doesn't have much flavor but I put the Cajun seasoning on the night before and that really seemed to add some flavor to the meat. This is one of my new favorite recipes.

Totally fantastic recipe!  Only one change... you only need to add 2 c of liquid as the juices from the roast will make it very soupy if you add more.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing!

This is an amazing recipe!  I highly recommend it just as it is.  Be sure to get a big enough pork roast.  Mine was only 1.62 lbs and it was only enough for 1 meal with 4 people (2 of which are teenage boys!)

Very tender! I used some thick pork chops I had and cooked them in a bottle of beer and lots of onions in the crockpot. I added Famous Dave's Sweet & Zesty BBQ sauce, some LA Hot Sauce and a shake of seasoned rice vinegar. Delish!

I made this recipe with a few minor alterations -- used a pork tenderloin,reduced the amount of garlic and browned the meat in a 1.2 butter, 1/2 olive oil combination.  I cut the liquid smoke in half and even that was too much.  As another reviewer said, it didn't smell very good and I think it was the liquid smoke.  When it was done, and I drained the liquid, the pork was super tender and pulled apart perfectly. The taste was great and did not have the smoky aftertaste we were afraid it would have.  We added barbecue sauce and it was very good.  I think next time, I might do what another reviewer said, and smoke it slightly on the grill before putting in the slow cooker instead of using the liquid smoke.

Excellent,   Use the cajun seasonings from this same site so that you can adjust to your family's preferences--the bottled Cajun seasonings were too salty.   Also, skim the fat from the top to make it far more healthy.

I've made this recipe about half a dozen times, sometimes with changes. Do take the time to brown the meat - it does make a difference in the flavor. You can make any other fancy changes you wish, but the recipe can hold its own. I serve this as a sandwich with Diana's BBQ Sauce, and a side of coleslaw.

I had only ever had pulled pork once and I wasn't impressed with it.  My best friend craved the pork at a local place so I tried it and thought I could do better!  I followed this recipe and made a few slight changes, like adding some rosemary and a can of chicken broth.  I served it with some bar-b-que sauce on kaiser rolls with a slice of red onion and french fried onions.  Now it has become a favorite of my family's and my friend won't go back to the restaurant any more because she says this is much better!  Thank you!

I put this recipe together exactly as described, except I increased the onion, garlic and liquid smoke a bit because I had a very big roast. It was amazing! At the end of the cooking time, it pulled apart easily with a fork, and wasn't too greasy, even though my pork shoulder was quite fatty. It got rave reviews! My husband and our houseguest couldn't stop eating it! Nothing went to waste. Not only were the last few leftovers perfect for pork fried rice, when I reserved the liquid from the crock pot and refrigerated it, the next day I simply scraped off the fat and used the flavored water to make rice. I couldn't recommend this recipe more.

I really loved this.  I used a pork roast with fat and bone.  I cut the meat from the bone and basically followed the recipe.  It cooked in the crock pot all night on high and I turned it to warm the next day.  By the time I got home it was warm but not hot.  I removed the fat and pulled the meat apart.  The juice was so yummy that I reserved some for soup later in the week.  We made BBQ sandwiches and everybody raved.  The next night my husband added the left-overs to mac-n-cheese and that was great too!  This was a hit for our Southern (Alabama) family!

My family loved this pork.  It made a great gravy.  I planned to make sandwiches, but instead served over mashed potatoes with gravy.  Made sandwiches w/ the leftovers.  I cooked a double batch.

Excellent!  The whole family loved it, even picky eaters!  We also made the coconut cake that was recommended in another review and that was great too!  We served the pulled pork on rolls with bbq sauce and a scoop of home made coleslaw on top.  Messy, but incredible!

I did 12 oz. of beer and the rest water, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I did not care for this recipe.  I couldn't stand the smell.  But, to  save it I  did pile it on the  bun and  used Sweet Baby Ray's  sauce and cheese.  That helped a lot, but I will not make it again.

Great recipe.  The only thing we did differently was to add less water and we didn't use the smoke flavoring.  I don't like smoked food.  It was really good with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, but was equally good without it.  My two dinner guests couldn't stop say, "oh my god this is so good!".  You know it's a great recipe when that happens!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutly great.  I made it for a work party and people went crazy.  The seasoning made it spicy so tone it down if you prefer.  I cooked it on a Sunday night, let it sit in the fridge over night and warmed it the next day for the party.  I think is needs to sit overnight after you pull it so it can soak up the flavor.

I was going to give suggestions and share my ideas of how to make this recipe better, but I realized that the changes I made amounted to a whole new recipe!  It was ok, but the additions and alterations I made as I put this dish together made it much better.  The "how-to" portion of preparing and cooking the pork was great!

I made this as directed and felt that it really lacked flavor.  As others recommended I added barbeque sauce, but felt that the flavor of the sauce didn't go well with the flavor of the pork.  I also thought that cutting the pork into chunks and browning it, as well as cooking on high, made the meat drier than pulled pork recipes that I have used.

This is a very yummy recipe. We love it! My only change was I used the whole bottle of liquid smoke instead of 1T. It added great flavor. Also it is best to eat on a hard roll, or something toasted. We tried the first time on hamburger buns and they got soggy fast.

I love this meat. I put it on some buns and then add some bbq sauce (I use a recipe from this site - Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce ). It is really, really good. My whole family loves it.

Very good recipe for basic, simple pulled pork.  I like spicier foods so I increased the Cajun seasoning a bit (1-2 pinches extra) and used a tangy brand of BBQ sauce.

This is my first time rating a recipe! And it's now my go to recipe for slow cooked pulled pork. I use to make the Root Bear recipe but not now. Don't get me wrong it's also a great recipe, it's just two different taste. The only thing I did different was to cut down on the cajin spice as my family isn't into that but I'll add a little more next time. Its a MUST KEEP.

My family like the flavor of this, but like others have said, it resulted in a pool of liquid. I had to fish out the pork and then drain it, reserving just a tiny amount of liquid to keep the meat moist. Next time I'll use 3 cups of water instead, and maybe kick up the spices a bit. Topped with BBQ sauce, this is a great meal.

Very good! Started it from frozen and cooked 10 hours on low. Because of it being frozen I missed out on the browning, but it's still great.  I added some cider vinegar, just don't want pulled pork without it, and a splash of Worcestershire. Kept the rest of the seasonings the same.  Only used 3 cups of liquid and that was fine. Served with Dave's Coleslaw (also on this site), BBQ sauce, and pickles. It had just the right amount of bite without being too sweet. I was drawn to this recipe to start with because of its lack of sugar, I often find pulled pork too sweet.  Loved this meal!

Loved it! Used 2 c cider vinegar in place of 2 c water. Used cajun seasoning from Winco bulk section - not so salty. Added bbq sauce on the sandwich. Had Coleslaw on the side. Delicious!!!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and I though it was very good. SumBrenda is right. This is a recipe for making a very moist pulled pork in your slow-cooker to which you later add the BBQ sauce or seasonings of your choice. It doesn't have a great deal of flavor on its own, but it isn't meant to. Everyone in my family added their own favorite sauce to the little piles on their plates. I liked it best with a vinegar-based Carolina sauce. Of the base recipe, I would probably have added a little more liquid smoke. I ended up putting a quart-sized bag of it in the freezer after a meal of it on the day I cooked it. I saved some of the leftover liquid from the slow-cooker and put it in the fridge to solidify any fat and skim it off. I then used a bit of this jus in the freezer bag to keep the pork from drying out. Since the finished pork doesn't have a strong flavor, I think you could also easily turn this from southern BBQ to something Mexican with green chiles and additional spices. I'll definitely do this again, especially since it'll soon be too cold outside to cook a lot on the grill.

Good stuff! The only change I made is I used beef stock instead of water and cut the amount in half. I also strain the liquids and cook them down to about half and add them back to the pulled pork.

This recipe was fantastic. It is like the typical un-sauced pulled pork you get in bbq restaurants, but far more juicy! The meat was so tender, and had a rich savory flavor that went great on the buttered and toasted hamburger buns I served it with. I made this in my small crockpot (3qt or so), and thought there was too much liquid, but it was perfect. The only slight change I made to the recipe was to use cajun seasoning, because I did not have creole. I read the ingredients, and they matched up almost perfectly, though the recipe I saw for creole had some oregano, so I added that. I was pretty heavy handed in the seasoning dept, and I think that just added to the flavor. 

Also, when it was time to shred the meat, I removed all the loose bits and fat, along with about 1/2 the cooking liquid, before adding the shredded pork back to the pot. This made it easier to serve for me. This fed my family of 3, with anough left over for lunch for dad tomorrow. This is a good recipe for my family because I love bbq, but not the sauce, while my husband adores the sauce. This will be made frequently from here on out! Don't forget to brown the meat nicely, I think it lended a lot to the flavor.

Delicious with just a few lil changes to suit our 2-person family! Used a bone-in 3.25lb shoulder arm blade roast. Left whole, rubbed with 2 T Creole Rub (Cajun is too salty for us); left wrapped overnight in frig. Did not sear. Minced 1/2 sweet onion with 5 cloves garlic in processor. In crock I mixed 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 1 T apple cider vinegar; 1 T Worchester; 1 t liquid smoke, added garlic & onion and threw in two dried chipotle chiles for fun. Put on high for one hour then put pork in with 12 oz. of Odells IPA Beer. At 6 hours it was ready to pull. Strained liquid off and refrigerated liquid overnight to separate fat off; cooled then pulled pork, discarding bone, fat and silverskin (do not feed this to pets - onions are very bad for dogs and cats!) The next day, put most of the defatted liquid and shredded (pulled) pork back into crock pot to warm and infuse juices. At this point I corrected spiciness to suit us; Hubster uses BBQ sauces, I do not, so it has to be tasty from the get-go for me! We ate sliders with a variety of added yummies like roasted green chile, havarti cheese, red onion, homemade refrigerator pickles; Hubster prefers Trader Joes Sweet and Smokey BBQ on the bread. I also made my own Pico d'Gallo and we enjoyed this on tortillas with eggs the next day...which is why I NEVER add BBQ sauce to the crockpot, so I can be creative with leftovers! This freezes well too. VERY YUMMY!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I had about 1 3/4 cup beef broth in my fridge that needed using so I used that in place of some of the water. I just added enough water to get to 4 cups. I served this on toasted hoagie rolls, drizzled with a little sweet & spicy barbeque sauce and topped with coleslaw. The meat alone was fantastic and made some amazing sandwiches!

Just made this today.  I was pretty worried about leaving it in the crock-pot on HIGH for 6 hours, but it is fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly and got exactly what I was hoping for: tender, flavorful pork ready for a pulled pork sandwich, a creative salad, or a variety of other purposes.  I saved the liquid in a separate container, and the meat was plenty moist without using the liquid tonight.

A HUGE hit with the family!  I left out the liquid smoke, and added BBQ sauce (then put back in the oven for about 15 minutes).  It had a nice "bite" to it.  Everybody was surprised I was able to pull it off!  Will definitely make this again.  It would also be a great party dish.

This was a great easy to follow recipe. I've only made it once. Once cooked I mixed it with one of our favorite BBQ sauces, reheated the mixture slowly and made sandwiches. They were a hit at the table. I want to try this with different BBQ sauces inlcuding a home made sauce. Cheers!

Excellent! Super easy. I would serve this for company. The pork was very flavorful and tender. I made mine with 2.7 pounds pork tenderloin and 3c. water. This one is a keeper!

Will follow the recipe more closely next time.  DO NOT take the suggestion to use cider vinegar as part of the liquid - or if you do, use a very small amount...unless you like caustic fumes coming from your pork.  Also I cut pork roast into 4 good size pieces, browned and had covered with liquid in the crock pot,  Cooked on high for 4.5 hrs - meat was very dry...trying to rescue it with bbq sauce..  Will try again..

Holy moly this is FANTASTIC! AS IS! I didn't stray from the recipe at all and I'm so happy I didn't. First, so easy to make. Second, the smells in the house made me anxious to devour it! Third, it was delicious and my whole family loved it enough to take some camping with us next week. Seriously, this is perfect as is. Just add the amount of sauce you desire after the fact, but this is perfect. Easy to prepare, easy easy easy to shred, and easy to enjoy.

My family loved this.  I've never made anything like this before.  It makes a great meal to come home to after work.  I let the seasoning sit on the meat for about a 1/2 hour before I browned it.  I also used canola oil instead of butter, a little extra cajun seasoning, 2 cloves of garlic and a dash more liquid smoke.  Next time I will use less water as I had to drain the meat a bit or the buns got soggy.  Will certainly make again.  Even my son (Mr. Picky) enjoyed it!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Love this website!!

This is the first pulled pork recipe I've ever made. It was so easy and turned out great! I used tenderloin instead of roast because it is all my grocery store had that was boneless. I put BBQ sauce on the bun and not in the crock pot. I also left out the onion because I forgot to pick one up at the store :( But I love onion and would definitely add it next time! Will definitely make again!

Excellent!   Very quick and easy.   I also followed someone elses recommendation and skipped the whole browning part.  Also it was done in 5 hours.  I guess it would depend on your crock pot.   I will definitely make this one again and again.

This was a great way to use up sale roasts from the frezer.  I strained the liquid and kept the shredded pork in about a third of it, using a slotted spoon to serve so the buns didn't get soggy.  The amount of spice was perfect.  Delicious with a little BBQ sauce spread on the bun, Sweet Resturant Slaw on top and a side of Baked Fries.  Next time will try with swiss, jalapenos, and fresh onion along with Tangy Dill Potato Salad.  Yum!

Great recipe.  I used the loin.  It fell apart perfectly with a fork.  Served with BBQ sauce on a grilled onion roll.   Everyone loved it.

I used a 2 1/4 lb pork loin and followed the exact directions.  I served it with D.B Yummers (a local BBQ sauce) and cole slaw on Kaiser rolls. The only bad thing about this recipe is that I can no longer eat pulled pork anywhere but at home!  Delicious!

I love this recipe. Really hits the spot in the wintertime when you can't grill out and are missing that smoky BBQ flavor.

Excellent pulled pork!  My husband and I made this on a chilly winter Chicago Sunday for dinner.  It made our apartment smell SO good!!!  It was filling and delicious for a winter night and reminded us a little bit of warmer months to come.  Excellent with dill pickles.

Fast, moist & easy!  The liquid smoke flavoring makes it taste restaurant-style.  We found that instead of mixing any kind of BBQ sauce into the cooked pork, serving the pulled pork by letting people add their own BBQ sauce, like ketchup, made the smoke flavor and the BBQ flavor come out perfectly together.

This was good. It took much longer to get tender than I thought (I gave it 8 hours but it still wasn't tender) .... I had to keep cooking it in the slow cooker overnight and used it for lunch the next day instead of dinner. Also, I don't know if this is typical but the pork smelled really weird while cooking-- bad enough that my family made me move the slow cooker to the porch. When it was done though it was delicious! Definitely needs a good barbecue sauce!

Didn't really care for this recipe. Not a lot of flavor. Only flavor that comes through is the smoke. Rather bland and a little dry.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!!!!  I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out simply fantastic.  I, like other reviewers stated, started it cooking on high for 2 hours and then reduced the heat to low for an additional cooking time of 6 hours.  The meat was juicy, tender and practically shredded itself.    I did not use the butter but used spray olive oil instead and used garlic paste.  The next time I will use onion powder since we do not like to bite into pieces of onions.  I served this on a whole wheat roll with homemade barbeque sauce and it was awesome.  I will be trying it over a bed of rice too.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Made recipe as stated. The meat was very tender and juicy. Next time I will cut back on the liquid smoke. A little too much for my taste. I served it on lightly toasted sesame seed buns and topped with thin slices of red onion. Was pretty good.

This is such a great recipe! A group of us mom's made this for our sons' graduation party. One mom used season salt and cayenne instead of the cajun seasoning and it gave it a really good kick! Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Finally I found just what I was looking for!! I wanted a pulled pork that had enough flavor to stand on its own without BBQ sauce. The only changes I made was that I rubbed the 8 lbs. pork shoulder (bone in)  with Quick Tender by Morton and pepper, I put it in a big ziploc bag and put it in the fridge overnight. I also browned the pork on our charcoal grill, I used a really small amount of charcoal to keep it from getting to hot. This gave it a great smoke flavor. I returned the meat and juices to the crock pot and followed the recipe exactly. I cooked on high for 5 hours, drained the excess liquid and cooked on low for 1 hour. My family raved! From 2 yrs old to 40 years old love it!! A new keeper for our family!

YUM!! I couldn't possibly say enough about this recipe, it's very easy to prepare & tastes delicious.  I make this exactly as written & wouldn't change a thing.  There is no need to take the pork out of the crock, just stir it up & it falls apart on it's own. Even better the next day.  Bravo on posting this!

All I can say is WOW!!! It was delicious and is very good left over too. Make sure you decrease the amount of water..I'd say reduce by at least 1 half. Aside from reducing the water, I followed the recipe exactly and would change nothing next time.

Good recipe and flavor. We have pulled pork a lot around here. If you have a favorite bbq sauce recipe (or if you can get some sauce from Moonlight BBQ from Owensboro, KY) this is the perfect pork sandwhich. Serve the sauce warm and drizzle it over the pork on your sandwich. Mmmm good!

I agree with a lot of others who say this recipe makes for very tender pork, which is good, but as far as taste, I found it to be very bland too - definitely need to top the sandwiches with bbq sauce.  Also, in my opinion, 4 cups of water is a lot of liquid.  I think next time I'd add less, although I suppose the meat needs to be covered with liquid in order to make it tender.  As others suggested, I might try using beer, beef or chicken broth, or maybe a combination of them.

This was so good! The only change I made was to add two tbsp. of liquid smoke instead of one. I served this with bourbon bbq sauce and jalapenos on the side.

This is the way to make pulled pork everyone raved about it and wanted to take leftovers I also made A Very Popular BBQ Sauce from this site to accompany the pork the only thing I changed in the sauce was spicy brown mustard instead of dry.

Awesome recipe! My family loved it! I will make a double batch next time to have some to freeze! After it was done cooking I drained off the liquid and put the pork back in the slow cooker and added sweet rays bbq sauce and kept it warm until everyone was ready to eat. It was perfect! :)

Me and my family absolutely LOVE this recipe.  SIMPLE ingredients but very tasty.  

We used Chef Paul Prudhomme's blackened redfish seasoning as the cajun seasoning which allows a lot of taste but not spicy for those delicate palates.  ENJOY!

My first experience with "pulled pork".Cooked this exactly as the recipe stated and took this up to my son who rarely likes my cooking. He's still calling out raves and planning what to put on the next 2 buns. Thanks.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and tripled it for a party and it got rave reviews from everyone.  Six hours on high was the perfect cooking time - it fell apart perfectly in shreds.  I didn't find that it was lacking in flavor at all using water as the recipe states, instead of chicken stock or beer.  I used a pork shoulder, since that is what my butcher recommended for pulled pork.  It did have quite a bit of fat, but that gave it great flavor and when I shredded the meat I just pulled away the remaining fat.  The only thing I noticed that I haven't seen anyone else comment on was the amount of liquid.  When it was finished cooking, the meat was absolutely swimming in liquid.  So I strained out the meat and onions, kept a little juice for moisture, and gave the 2 quarts of liquid to the dogs!  Next time I might try to reduce the liquid a little bit to avoid this straining step.

For a simple recipe, this dish is full of flavor.  I used a $1.49/lb pork roast and the texture turned out exceptional.  My next dish will include a small can of diced green chiles to add a little more kick and flavor.

Really tasty and really easy.  I found that it cooked much more quickly than the recipe called for, but I may have cut the pork into smaller chunks or browned a little too long.   But that's not a bad thing for a busy mom!!!  Highly recommended with buns and cheese.  :)

I tried this recipe using a 4 pound pork roast, which I cut up into smaller chunks.  I put together the sauce for the crock-pot doubling the recipe except I used two bottles of dark porter beer instead of water.  I marinated this with the pork overnight, emptied the contents into the crock-pot and the started cooking in the morning.  I let this cook for eight hours on low and then put the pork on a tilted, sided cookie sheet to cool and drain and then pulled the pork apart with two forks.  EXCELLENT flavor.

Delicious! I followed others tips added half beer and half chicken stock, decreasing both to 3 cups of liquid, I also omitted the liquid smoke, next time I will try a bit. Also added homemade cajun seasoning from this site and 'Sweet Baby Rays' BBQ sauce and it was a hit. The spicy flavor was great, BBQ sauce was not even necessary. We used Ranch rolls and added extra juice from the pork for dipping in, kinda like hot roast beef sandwhiches. I think with a little adjusting in seasonings this would be great for pork tacos. "Carnitas"

Really wanted this one to be good but despite all the amazing reviews i was semi-disappointed. I followed a reviewer's suggestions and used chicken broth in addition to the water, so about 1/2 and 1/2. I also added extra smoke flavoring and added worchester sauce. The final product came out EXTREMELY bland and was revived only by a mixture of ketchup, maple syrup, bbq sauce, cinnamon and cayenne pepper that my hubby came up with. We ate the pork with improv'd sauce over buns and it was pretty good, but alone, nothing special in the least.

This recipe has become a keeper around here.  What others have said is correct, it needs some more spice but about 2 hours before it's done I start messing around with the spices until I get it where I want it.  The meat falling apart tender and these meal usually yields quite a bit of leftovers.  I also serve them with some swiss cheese on the bun.

This is awesome and tastes like restaurant pork!  I did add a bit of BBQ sauce to the pot after pulling the pork, which added a little kick.  I also used garlic pepper pork roast to start.

This was OK. Not quite the flavour I was looking for. It needs plenty of BBQ sauce once the meat is shredded.

I discovered this recipe about 6 weeks ago and have made it four times.  It's very good and easy to make for a crowd.  I normally let the adults dip in, then add BBQ sauce to the meat for the kids who seem to prefer it that way.  Thanks for a well-loved dish!

This recipe is good as is. But, I added a little brown sugar, Worcestershire, vinegar and beef broth with less water.  I notice some comments talking about not browning the meat or about draining the liquid. If you just put the meat in the slow cooker without browning it nicely, you are ignoring all the wonderful magic of the Maillard reaction and essentially just boiling meat. It is not the same and most definitely does not taste the same. In addition, after cooking all the flavor out of the meat it would be a travesty to poor the flavor down the drain. Instead, I poured all the liquid in to a wide pan and reduced it down over high heat. When the liquid was slightly thickened and less than 1/4 the amount that it was, I adjusted seasonings a bit and added the liquid with all the wonderful flavor back to the meat where it belongs.

It's a good substitution for the real thing. Though, recommend preping the meat the day before and seasoning it with your choice of Cajun spices. Cover in marinade bowl and refrigerate till ready. Did not use water but instead, halfed the amount and used a bottle of my favorite craft beer.

This was ok. The meat was very tender and moist but the flavor was a bit lacking. We added extra spices to liven up the flavor before serving.

This is a good recipe for pulled pork. I think that browning the meat is a must. It gives you that crust that smoking does. I would add a little more liquid smoke the next time. I used chicken broth instead of water. Came out delicious just a tad bland. In my opinion all pulled pork must be served dry. Then you can add sauce etc right before eating.

This is delicious!  I was short on time.  So I used this recipe for ingredients, but cooked it on my lowest rack at 350 for 2.5 hours.  It was fantastic!

I followed the recipe, and I think some people are expecting a tangy/spicy BBQ style pork.   Personally, I enjoyed the fact that you could  taste the pork and smoke.  I topped it with a cabbage/apple slaw on a bun...delicious!  The only thing I changed was I used a smoked applewood rub on the pork before browning it (in my opinion there is never enough smoke flavor.)  I will definitely make this again.

I used leftover cooked pork.  I used a little less spice, but we enjoyed it. The slow-cooker was a great way to reheat the meat without drying.  I will try the recipe again with fresh meat.

didn't have actual Cajun Seasoning on hand, but found the recipe here on Allrecipes.com and had all the needed components.  
this pulled pork is delicious, mildly spicy, not sweet or "barbecue-y" tasting.

Made with a tenderloin. Covering the meat in Cajun seasoning added just the right kick. And the onions and garlic gave a subtle extra flavour (and made my place smell amazing).

I didn't have Cajun seasoning, and I wanted to make it in a fashion that could serve as pulled pork on sandwiches or pulled pork in tacos.  So I substituted Taco seasoning for the Cajun seasoning.  Did NOT use liquid smoke, as I don' t care for it.  I also used half the water.

there is too much liquid and the meat has more of a "stewed" taste/texture rather than roasted. I had to dump most of the liquid out. After the first time, I changed the liquid to chicken broth and reduced it to 1/2c. Bear in mind that there will be liquid from the meat as it cooks. The remaining ingredients were left as is, though I do prefer to not include the liquid smoke.  After cooking and shredding the meat, I adjusted the taste by simply adding more of the Cajun seasoning. No need for any barbecue sauce.

We tried it tonight & I followed the recipe straight down the line. It was tender, melt in your mouth tender but it was so bland. The only thing that saved this recipe was adding Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

I guess I'm used to real Southern Pulled Pork that's been smoked & not Liquid Smoke Pulled Pork.

I won't be trying this recipe again.

I don't like pork, but I LOVED this recipe.  It is the Liquid Smoke, I think, that made it so delicious. I followed the recipe pretty close, but didn't cook the onions and garlic--just threw them in the crock pot.  Think I'll make a pork roast next week using this recipe and adding potatoes and carrot and nixing the bbq sauce.

I served this pulled pork for a party and everyone loved it!  It was my first time making any kind of pulled pork and it was pretty easy.  I made it the night before then re-heated in a crock pot for serving.  Had the BBQ sauce on the side.

I did add extra smoke flavouring, and cut down abit on the water, but it all depends on your tastes :) 
Thanks for a great recipe!

I just made this tonight for my family, it was a bit too spicy/hot for my kids, but i personally loved it. i may use less of the seasoning next time and definitely less water. but i give it 4 stars, just because the directions were vague, the liquid was way too much and boiled over my pot, and after shredding it didnt tell you what to do with the liquid. i emptied it and saved one cup, after shredding it, i poured the cup back into the pot to keep the moisture. other than that, it was delish!

Very good! Skipped the stovetop part and just put the roast right in the crockpot with some slices in it to allow the juices to get into the center parts of the meat. Didn't have liquid smoke so I used Worchestshire sauce. I cut back on the liquid a bit and it was still plenty, and substituted 12 ounces of beer for some of the water. It was good served as-is on potato buns, without any BBQ sauce, but that could be easily added. Made my own Cajun seasoning using the recipe on this website.

I usually do not give anything 5 stars. This was good. Simple and the meat goes with just about anything.

We make this all the time and have never bothered with BBQ sauce, although that would be great too. We love it with au jus on pistolettes.

Really great recipe!  Makes great leftovers as well.  We tried it without mixing in the BBQ sauce and instead put it on top.  This was a nice alternative but I'm sure either way would be delicious.  Thanks!

Very moist. Topped it with some homemade BBQ sauce ona bun- delicious. Would like to figure out how to give it a more "off the grill" charred flavor, though...

It smelled so good I had to sample some right out of the slow cooker. Amazing flavor, absolutely tender meat. I used my own cajun blend: black pepper, cayenne, thyme, sweet basil, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, chili powder all blended together with a good amount of salt. I also threw in a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire.

This was great.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning (this should be a staple in everyone's home) instead, and it was fine. The browning of the pork really locks in the flavors. We didn't put anything else on it, it was yummy.

The first time I made this it turend out dry and flavorless.  I tried it again and learned that overcooked it. It only took me 3.5-4 hours to cook it.   I also added more flavor the second time.  Both times I made this recipe, I used the broth to make a bbq sauce by adding ketchup, brown sugar, other spices/flavorings and cooking it down in a sauce pan.  It turend out amazing.

This was pretty good.  I used 1 cup beer and 2 cups liquid.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and used only a teaspoon liquid smoke.  I accidentally cooked this on low for 6 hours and it wasn't as tender as I hoped, but that was probably the reason why.  I put the meat on a bun and topped with BBQ sauce and cole slaw.  It would have been too bland without it.

Excellent recipe! I had to add some salt and crushed red pepper to the crock pot. Also sauted some onions and jalepenos then added the pulled pork and some nice spicy chipolte BBQ sauce....This was a great recipe, so easy and so good. I'll be making it for parties! Thanks for sharing it!

I added Lawrys instead of cajun flavoring, (too spicy for wife); I noted you have to add alot of seasoning otherwise it comes out plain.

Love this recipes!  We're not usually big "pork" people, but I was looking for something different so I tried this.  It is now our absolute FAVORITE meal!  YUM!!!  It will be added to our weekly rotation.

I made this for a family party. I impressed my father-in-law & brother-in-law with the taste of this recipe. That is not an easy task to accomplish. They are both 'country' boys and love their pulled pork. Great Recipe!!

Great recipe for Superbowl Sunday.  Made it days in advance, froze, defrosted, heated in microwave, let sit in the crockpot to stay hot so I could watch the game too.  Used 2 bottles of beer and 2 - 3 c water, plenty of liquid few dashes of worstershire sauce.  Nice crusty roll with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.

I am finally getting around to rating this amazing recipe after serving it to friends and family around 6 times now.  I have easily tripled the recipe to ensure there is enough to go around.  It is now THE expected main dish at our yearly New Years Eve party.  Thank you!!!

Followed the recipe as is, but started with a pre-seasoned (onion and garlic) Hormel roast.  The flavor was great, and the meat was tender and moist.

Awesome!  So moist and good!  Simple flavor, but that is how pulled pork should be.  I made a slaw of shredded cabbage, pickles, onions, sugar, vinegar, mustard, olive oil and put it on buns. YUM!

Excellent recipe! Decided to add just a tad more liquid smoke & some BBQ sauce to it & drained before serving on Kaiser rolls. Served with BBQ flavored potato chips. Made an excellent meal!

My husband said this was the best pulled pork he's ever had.  It was a huge hit at a football party we recently had.  I mix 1 bottle of Famous Dave's Devils Spit and 1 bottle of KC Masterpiece Maple & Brown Sugar bbq sauces for the last hour.  Its a great mixture.

I got home after going to the grocers and discovered I had bought beef instead of pork.  Still came out great.  I didn't use any of the left over juices but instead used some nice bbq sauce.  Will make this again this time with the pork! =)

This is the 2nd time making this. Like another reviewer did, I just put the whole thing in the crockpot. Added lots extra garlic, cajun seasoning and liquid smoke. Used a 3 lb. boston butt and in 6 hours pulled it out and it shredded itself! Added some of the leftover broth (there was alot) and added a bit of Sweet Baby Ray's - only cuz my family likes BBQ - i could've eaten it without. An easy, yummy keeper. Thanks!

This was SO good!!! I made it for a church gathering and everyone raved. I used Emril's Essence for the cajon seasoning which is what I had on hand and hickory flavored liquid smoke. Because I used more pork than what the recipe called for I increased the seasoning and liquid smoke. Very flavorful just the way it is. I served BBQ sauce on the side as an option but it definately didn't need it.

I added 4 tbs. of chipotle tabasco and 2 cups of BBQ sauce. The flavor came more from the sauce than the meat.

Loved it!!  I am making it for a second time today.  We went to a RibFest a couple of months ago where I got my first taste of pulled pork.   I made this recipe a few days later.

Very easy, and tasty. I tripled the recipe and there was a lot of water left over. I just drained it and the meat was nice and tender. Great with extra BBQ sauce.
