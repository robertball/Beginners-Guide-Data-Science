Winner!  What I liked about this when I looked over the recipe was the novel  addition of the cream cheese and it worked!  I did miss, however, some of the tang  and flavor more mayonnaise would have given it but a squeeze of lemon and some minced red onion fixed that right up.  LOVED the red bell pepper here!  I would never have thought to add that to tuna salad and it made a difference -  in a good way.  I didn't have carrots on hand and I'm not sure I would have liked them anyway  (simply because I don't like carrots in the first place except in cake) and I found celery was the substitute that worked for me.

I really like the touch of cream cheese with tuna.  As the footnotes suggested, I made it my own.  Added minced onion, sweet pickles, and almonds.  Thanks Joan!

I liked this, but not so much because the taste was anything new or different. It was because the cream cheese, added, made it hold up better. I have a manual shredder that sort of looks like a potato peeler. That was way faster than small chopping carrot. It makes it a good size too. I realized I didn't have red pepper only green. So, I used the green one, but only did 2 Tblsp. minced. Lastly, I chose this recipe to use up an equal amount of canned white chicken meat. I used whipped cream cheese. It is lower in calories and stirs into things more easily and regular mayo. Recalculating the calories, and actual servings, it ended up as 175 cal. for 3 good sized servings. That didn't include a tomato, for stuffing, bread, or anything else. That was just for the filling. I would make this again, if for the way it held together when scooped.

This is very good with the addition of cream cheese. I sliced a cucumber in half lengthwise, scraped out the seeds, and filled both halves with this tuna salad. I'll be making this tuna salad recipe again.

I was out of tuna so I used chicken. Delicious! The cream cheese is a delightful addition. Tuna is on my shopping list so I can make this again.

OMG! So good. I've never had cream cheese in it before but it pairs nicely. I took the chefs note and made it my own. I added roasted redpeppers and sweet heat relish. I'll never go back to old regular tuna salad.

Made this using home canned salmon since I always seem to have more of that than my canned tuna. Other than that the only thing I did different was to omit the carrots since I didn't have any on hand and I added about half a diced shallot. Made these for hubby's  lunch wraps. He's already asking me to make them again.

I didn't have tuna but used a can of pink salmon. I reduced mayo to 1tbsp, reduced cream cheese I'm half and dded the following:1/2 Serrano pepper for bit of a kick, and 2 tbsp of raw pumpkin seeds, 1tbsp organic hemp oil, and green onions.  Dish served 4- 1/2 cup servings for a total of 236 calories per serving.
