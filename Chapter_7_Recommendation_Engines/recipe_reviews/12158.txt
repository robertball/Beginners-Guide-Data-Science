Made this "mock" lemon cheesecake for Easter and everyone devoured it!  Said it was DELICIOUS!  And, it was!  Highly recommend for something creamy, quick and delicious.  Be careful though, had a hard time fitting it all in one pie shell!  YUM!

My husband loves this dessert! However, I do make some changes as well. I add lemon juice and lemon zest to the pudding for added zing. I also use heavy whipping cream because I can't stand the artificial taste of frozen whipped topping. I use a deep dish pie plate and make my own graham cracker crust. Also, I only add a spoonful of the cherries in the center on the top for show. With these changes this recipe is great!

This was sooooo easy to make.  I used low fat ingredients and still thought it was very tasty.

This was pretty good. Quick to prepare, but must have the chill time before serving. I used a chocolate graham crust which added to the flavor. This may be a one timer for me.

Great no bake dessert!  The filling is a bit too much for your standard store-bought graham cracker pie crust.  Next time I make this, I may make my own graham crcaker crust in either a 10-inch pie plate or a springform pan.  I did not use the full amount of cherry pie filling and just garnished some in the middle on top of the pie.  I also let mine set overnight in the fridge-this kind of dessert gets better the more its refrigerated.  My guests and I loved it.

Easy to make and makes a lot. I think it needs a larger crust - the 9 inch really almost overflows. Also, the lemon taste is very subtle so if you want a tart lemon taste this isn't the pie for you. I'd also cut the pie filling in half maybe not top it with cherries.

I guess I thought "fluffy" meant "light" when I made this recipe, so I was a bit surprised to see how heavy of a dessert it was. I made it precisely as directed, and it went together quickly and without fuss. It wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be, which is good, but it also wasn't tart enough for me, perhaps a shot of lemon juice would perk it up a bit. I didn't like how it looked with the cherries split up over the top and bottom either. It looked more inept than appetizing. I think itâ€™d be better to put the lemon mix, then all the cherries then the cool whip. I'll also use real whipping cream next time to get rid of the chemical taste of the cool whip.

Aside from all that, it tasted great the second day and with the changes I mentioned above, I will make it again. A different creamy dessert is always fun to try at a party!

Quick, easy and delicious. I would use a little less cherry pie filling next time though. The cherries were just a little too overwhelming for my taste.

I made this for dinner when company was coming and they devoured it!  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  I'm glad I didn't add more lemon because it had more of a cheesecake flavor.  I did prepare it a day ahead and refrigerated it overnight which helped the consistency and flavor.  It was WONDERFUL and I'll definitely be making it again!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I was not impressed with this pie. I love lemon, I love cheesecake, and I love cherries, but I just didn't care for it! The filling is way too much to fit into 1 pie crust. I'm not sure what could be changed to make it better, but I won't be trying this one again. Sorry!
