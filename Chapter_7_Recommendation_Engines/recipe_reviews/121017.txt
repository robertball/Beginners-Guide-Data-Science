Very nice bread! My husband loves pears so I thought I'd make this for him to take to work for breakfast. I cut the recipe in half and instead of using oil, I just used 1/2 cup of butter and creamed that with the sugar until nice and fluffy. I doubled the amount of vanilla and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I also used 2 cups of pears vs. 1 cup as I really wanted a bread chock full of fruit! The batter definitely is thick and I had to spread it into my baking dish. I topped it with turbinado sugar before popping it into the oven. It smelled great and tasted even better.

Had a wonderful crop of pears this summer, so I've been searching for interesting pear recipes.  This is an easy, adaptable recipe with great results!  I cut back on the sugar, added honey, cinnamon and cloves.  Make sure that the pears are well ripened to give full flavor!  Thanks!!

This was really goood but the only reason I rated it four stars was because of the amount of ginger.  I'm not a big ginger taste fan and the smell was rather strong while baking.  It mellowed though after it was finished and the ginger smell wasn't as strong tasting.  I will make it again but will cut back on the amount of ginger.  It's a great moist bread and really needs nothing else on it to serve.

I made these into muffins and sprinkled raw sugar on top and baked.  If you don't have a full hour to bake, this took less time and is easier to share.  I used all butter, no oil and will put in more pears next time I make this.  Overall a good and easy recipe perfect for fall.

This was a hit with the family!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  It was a little sweet for my taste so, next time I will use less sugar and add some cinnimon.

This bread is excellent.  I also added more cinnamon, vanilla, and pears.  I sprinkled the bread with cinnamon/sugar before baking.  I made 4 mini loaves cooking at convection 325 for about an hour.

I added cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Although it was quite nice and we certainly ate and enjoyed it, I did find this to be quite a dry loaf.  I don't think I'll make it again.

So yummy!! I even substituted the eggs for applesauce (1 egg = 1/3 cup) and this was DELICIOUS! As someone else suggested, I also added about a tsp of cinnamon. THE BEST!

Had two really ripe pears I needed to use. I made this and it turned out really good. I followed recipe exact except for I only made 1 loaf and used 1 1/4 cup pears. At first I thought it didn't raise enough, but after eating a couple slices I decided it was really good just the way it is. Thanks for the recipe!

Not my favorite- it wasn't bad but it was more cakey than bready.  I was looking for more of the zucchini bread feel but this was more of a cake taste.  I know I used another recipe before that we all love so I'll keep trying to find it on here. Not going to use this one again though.

Excellent bread!  Not overly sweet.  Love the chunks of pear.  I cooked a little under time (maybe 50 min); it may have been a little dry otherwise.  Love this unique recipe.

Loved this!  Halved the recipe, added cinnamon on the advice of other reviewers, and added a half cup of chopped walnuts.  Bread was moist and just sweet enough.  Will definitely make again.

Taste was good, but the bread was a little dry and had that pear texture.  Wasn't my children's favorite.

December 2007.  Used Rich and Ann's pears for several loaves for our Christmas exchange.  Also added 1 tsp ground cloves and 1 tsp allspice for more "spice".  Great holiday gift.
