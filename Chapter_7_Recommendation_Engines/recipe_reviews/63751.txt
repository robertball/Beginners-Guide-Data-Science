This IS quite yummy.  I had never used cottage cheese in guacamole so was curious.  However, I'm glad I blended everything together with my immersion blender; don't think I would have liked the appearance of the individual textures.   I did sprinkle lime juice over the cut avocado to keep the bright color and I added fresh cilantro, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I spread the dip on a flour tortilla with diced tomato and shredded lettuce for a quick and delicious wrap.

Great idea with the cottage cheese. I loved the dip. Substituted 4 Tbsp medium salsa for the chilies though. We aren't a spicy family! Enjoyed it with the Meatiest Vegetarian Chili for the slow cooker recipe and some tortillas chips as a nacho style dinner. It was great and my 9 year old asked is we could have this dinner every Friday night!

This was so bland I just started adding different hot sauces.  Finally made it so that I could at least taste it.  I suggest going back to the drawing board on this one.  I think it could use help, but I'm not good enough to offer any.  Sorry.

This was ok as written, but I loved the idea (I used fat free cottage cheese and it makes it much healthier than using almost all avacado). I would have given it 5 stars but I had to add garlic (2 cloves) and lime juice (1Tbsp) and cilantro.  Other wise, great idea, using fat free cottage cheese to add some protein.

I made this Avocado dip. I did make just one change. I used a 10 ounce can of died green chilies instead of a 4 once can. I read the other reviews. I didn't blend my dip. I just mixed it by hand. I love cottage cheese anyway. I mashed the avocados though. I didn't use salt & pepper. It was really good and cool. I dipped my tortilla chips in it.
