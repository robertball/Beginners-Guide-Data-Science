It's important to take some of the beans and squish them up in a bowl to make the liquid thicken up. Don't use less liquid, mash some of the beans then reintroduce them to the pot but this is to be done toward the last as needed. That is why  you use so much liquid.  It's the old fashioned seasoning way and it's good! Enjoy! Yes, this is also better eaten the following day, given time to give the flavors to ripen!

First, get yourself a big pot, a REALLY big pot.  I used a 5-qt dutch oven, only 1 lb. of sausage instead of two, and it was up to the top.  I followed the recipe except for using Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (seriously tastes just like smoked sausage) and used 1 lb instead of 2 lb (it was what I had on hand).   This recipe does take some time, but itâ€™s worth the effort.  I think the timing is off on a few things.  The beans will take longer to become soft, and the vegetables will take less time to cook.  I left this simmer for several hours, the consistency ended up being perfect, and although this recipe definitely is different, this is a very good version of red beans and rice.

This recipe motivated me to write my first review.  It is outstanding! I used smoked neck bones because the meat market was out of ham hocks (I would have used a smoked ham hock instead of the ham hock the recipe calls for).  I also used the full 2 lbs of smoked sausage (Aidells Andouille Sausage).  This recipe is delicious and satisfies your appetite on a cold day.

Pretty good red beans, though I wound up doubling the cayenne to get a more authentic taste. The second time I made it I sauteed a chopped yellow onion and bell pepper with 2 chopped stalks of celery, then added them to the pot. It rounded out the flavor. I reserved the chopped green onions to sprinkle over the top before serving. It was deserving of a 5th star after my changes.  One note; the title says "and Rice" but the recipe doesn't contain or mention rice except in the title.

Excellent red beans and rice.  I didn't use the ham hocks but did add some chicken bullion. I cook these in the crock pot, the rest of the recipe as written. Top with some raw chopped onions and a side of cornbread. So good!
