I enjoyed this recipe as a starter/build on recipe. However, the next time I prepare it, as a matter of personal preference I would only cook the carrots a couple of minutes or not at all. For my taste the marinade was a little too sweet, I would cut the sugar or increase the vinegar. Also, I felt that a splash of worcestire and prepared mustard would have jazzed this recipe up. I enjoy things zesty and spicy so I would throw in some pepper flakes and garlic. The recipe said to chop, which to me indicates smaller pieces. The next time I will cut the peppers, onions, and celery, it will be a little closer to bite size, to equal the carrots. I might try this recipe again with some modifications.

I've made this recipe several times with a few modifications.  Basically, I'm using it for the dressing part of the recipe -- I do not modify that part.  For the veggies, I usually use carrots, green beans, sliced beets, and sliced onions.  If I'm in a rush, I'll use (gasp!) canned carrots and green beans.  Reminds me of a salad I've gotten at a German restaraunt.  Very nice with German food since I don't care for the typical sauerkraut.  Great recipe!

Yummy! We love to have this salad in the fridge all summer long. One way I like to serve this is as a topping/dressing over a green salad. Topped w/ crumbled bacon makes it really excellent. I've started cutting back on the oil and never really noticed a difference. I use about 1/4C. of oil and 1/3C. vinegar. Also I switched the sugar to Splenda and decreased that to 1/3C. Love this salad!

My husband loves carrots. I decided to make him copper penny, he had never tasted it. when I made this recipe I cut the sugar (Splenda) and the oil in half. It made a thicker dressing that clings to the carrots. A big hit with Hubby!

I had this salad at my mom's home over
Christmas and it was excellent.  It was
easy to prepare and very tasty.  I
substituted some home grown green onions
for the onion called for in the recipe.
I think that the addition of the green
onion made the recipe even more tasty.

This is a good salad for something a little different.  I used less sugar than the recipie calls for and it turned out very good, although there seems to be too much dressing for the amount of carrots.  The next time, I will use more.

This is a recipe my mother used to make, and it's like home food to me. However, my son & husband do not care for it as much as I do - because of the texture of the cooked carrots. I probably won't make it again for that reason.

My mother-in-law has been making this forever & I was so delighted to find it here. Once you make this, you will understand.  It is delish & lasts for over a week in the fridge, gets better the 2nd day. Very fresh tasting.

I love the taste of this.  I use 3 pounds of carrots and omit the peppers (not a huge fan of peppers).  People always comment on how good this tastes.

I've loved this recipe from the first time I had it.  The recipe I use is a tad different.  An 8 oz. can of tomato sauce (instead of the soup), 1 tsp. prepared mustard and 1 tsp. Worchestershire sauce are the only difference.  Just about any 'firm' veggie works with this dressing.  One gal loves to spoon this salad over hot cornbread.  Hummmmm, guess whatever floats your boat!

Love this stuff !  I cooked the carrots for 8 mins.  I added garlic powder to taste to the sauce .  It was a little too sweet ,  so next time will cut the sugar a little .  Thank you for sharing.

I made this thinking it would be good, but when I tasted it, I absolutely loved it. I would give it more stars if I could. I did cut back on the sugar though, but that's because of personal taste; I just don't like that much sugar in stuff. Thanks for the posting.

Everyone loved these at Cromer Christmas, 2014.  Next time, cut the carrots myself instead of buying the pre-cut.

I've made this in most of the variations over 25 years, BUT we always use it as a salad dressing over various greens. Spinach. Mixed. Plain iceberg. Usually add more carrots.  Easy way to eat more fresh veggies. Keeps well several days.

I'd had a Copper Penny salad while I was married but only twice 'til I ran across the Allrecipes which I tried.

My "pennies" came  out as good as I recall but I did 'tweak' the recipe a bit --I used brown sugar vs white and I made/subbed a  simple homemade tomato soup.  I also adjusted the recipe from 5 servings to 3 and it came out great and I added  1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon.

I gave the recipe a solid 5 'cause it withstood my subtle changes and still came out great.

Ciao.

This is very good. I did use tomato sauce instead of soup because I didn't have any soup. I also added a touch of Worcestershire sauce. We will eat this for a while as it made a lot!

One of my favorite carrot recipes.  My mother-in-law made this often for family dinners  and this is the same as the recipe she gave me.  She sometimes served it warm if she didn't get around to making it the day before and I think it's delicious both ways.

What wonderful taste this sauce has. Its like sweet and sour. I didn't have celery and peppers don't agree with me so I eliminated them. This can be eaten cold or hot. I did use my homemade tomato soup in which I freeze into 6-8 oz chunks and it tasted the same. Easy to make and loved by all.
