These were really good.  Made one batch with candy-coated pieces which were ok but made the second batch using 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cups white chocolate chips and OH MY GOD - fabulous!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

These cookies were GREAT!  They do, however, come out pretty flat and stuck to the cookie sheet... remove them quickly.  I also suggest adding a few M&M's on the top of the cookies.

Wow! I used 2 c chocolate chips instead of the candy coated chocolate pieces. I also used organic sugars. These cookies taste incredible; a cookie dough flavor that is totally addictive. I freeze them and then defrost as needed; the amazing flavor seems to improve with freezing.

These are great! I decreased the amount of butter in half, but kept everything the same.  Start checking the cookies around 7 min, once they get light golden brown on the bottom pull 'em!

The product was excellent! I used mini M & Ms, included the coffee liqueur...and I have to say that the taste is superb. No need to spray the pans with non-stick, as some suggested. They slid right off the pan! I also used a cookie scoop to form the cookies. The dough seemed too moist for rolling in balls by hand. This is a keeper.

We really enjoyed this cookie recipe. The candy-coated chocolate pieces are okay (more for kids - crunchy chocolate) and pretty, but we loved this recipe w/semi-sweet chocolate chips even more.  I used both and they were cute and good for both kids and adults.  Thanks for sharing this.  Coffee Liquor was a nice addition. I used a cookie scoop and cooked them for about 6-7 mins. They kept a nice shape.

This cookie is an annual Christmas tradition in our family.  I follow the recipe exactly and store the baked cookies in the freezer.  They keep very well that way.

Lori thank you so much for the best cookie recipe I have EVER had!  I have probably made twenty plus batches of this cookie dough and everyone who has had the pleasure of eating it is just as impressed as I am.  I have made it with M&M's as well as chocolate chips. This is the ONLY chocolate chip cookie I will ever make.  My family begs me to make these!  Thank you!

By far the best M&M cookie ever.  One of the best cookies period.  The kahlua adds a interesting flavor and really makes these cookies special.  I'm going to try these with semi-sweet chips for a more "grown-up" look.

This was not at all what I was expecting.  I was looking for a sugar cookie with M&M's and what I got was a dry puffy oatmeal cookie with M&M's.  They were not gross, but I wouldn't make them again.  Maybe I am being overly critical because I was excited about having a different kind.

These M&M cookies were so delicious,they were EVEN BETTER,than our local grocery store's bakery M&M cookies!! These cookies were so flavorful and nice and moist too!! If you are an M&M fan,you won't want to miss out on making these cookies!! One little tip that I would like to add,is before you add the cookie dough to your cookie sheets,MAKE SURE to spray your cookie sheets with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray,so the cookies won't stick to the cookie sheets!! I give these cookies TWO THUMBS UP,and so does my whole family!! ;-)

This is the most awesome cookie recipe!  I didn't have any coffee liqueur so left that out, and they were still great!  The house smelled great while they were baking, too.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks, Lori!

I made these for my nephew to take back to school with him.  He loved them and has even requested that I make this receipe again.  We did not use the coffee liquer and they turned out great.  This recipe is great for folks who like oatmeal cookies and chocolate!  Definitely worth a try!
