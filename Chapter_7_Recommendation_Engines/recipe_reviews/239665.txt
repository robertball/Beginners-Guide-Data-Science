I was really disappointed.  I used Hunt's tomato sauce, no salt added, but it was more than not having enough salt.  I added double Adobo seasoning, double pepper, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika, and a dash of cayenne pepper, and 2 TBSP. Tequila Dale's Wing sauce.  
 Another thing...   I LOVE OLIVES!!!   BUT I didn't "get it" in this sauce.  For me, it was unnecessary.
