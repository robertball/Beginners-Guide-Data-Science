Bravo, we loved it!  I added a small can of sliced black olives (mixed some with the ground beef, & sprinkled some on top with the cheese.) I definately will make again.   Terri

Very tasty recipe! I chose this for New Year's Eve because I had all the ingredients on hand. The one change I made was to add the chopped onion in with the ground beef. Hubby doesn't like raw onion, but I wanted the flavor and this worked well. I had the sour cream on the side as an optional topping as well as chopped green onions for that raw onion crunch. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I served this over brown rice as a main course.  I thought it would have been better if it was thicker by substituting a chunky salsa instead of the picante sauce, which often is more liquidy.  I also would have liked half the amount of cheese.  A lb. of cheese is quite a bit.

Really tasty! Used muenster and pineapple salsa instead of picante sauce. Would simply warn that it comes out VERY hot! and is difficult to eat until it cools down a great deal.

This was really good! Only complaint was that it was liquidy and I could hardly taste the beans. Next time I would add more beans on bottom and know when I first scooped out dip, I would need to drain liquids right away.

Gave this a small sample today for Super Bowl it's a super winner going on the table. May add some black olives and some more heat several people coming love it hot. Fantastic base, you have a lovely winner.
