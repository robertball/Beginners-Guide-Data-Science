I just used a fully cooked Kielbasa sausage and used onion, and red pepper pieces with some pinapple chunks. We liked this and it was easy and tasty!(no marinade time) The sauce glazed the sausage and veggies nicely on the grill. Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good, kind of hard to taste the flavor of the sauce.  I might try leaving the veggies and sausage in the mixture for a few hours before grilling so that it can soak in some of the flavor.

I skewered sweet itialian sausage and it was delicious over a spanish rice I made. I didn't use carrots but when it's kabob style you can use pretty much anything you want. The sauce was simple and I painted on kabob as I was grilling.
