Fabulous! I make different types of slaws all the time and this is my new favorite recipe. So simple and it melds well together. At first I was concerned it would be too tangy from the ACV, but it mellowed out pretty quickly and turned out amazing. My brother ate a mountain of it. I will be making this all summer

3.18.16   I followed this recipe to the letter, and although it tastes pretty good, it is very runny.  I didn't even use all of the mayo part of the dressing because the slaw already was so watery in the bowl.  If I make this one again, I'll do one of two   things:  (1) cut the vinegar portion of the dressing in half,keeping the mayo the same,  or (2) eliminate the vinegar dressing all together and just mix in the mayo portion.  I'd probably go with the latter option, because  I think this recipe simply may have too many ingredients.  I'm the first reviewer, and I don't want to discourage others from trying this recipe, but I just don't care for slaw with this dressing consistency.  You'd have to put this slaw in a small bowl, otherwise, it's going to run all over your plate.
