I make the full formal beef wellington every year with my mom for Christmas.  This year its just me.  This recpie was a great reference for making just enough for my husband and I. The red wine sauce is ideal for this dish.

Recipe text does not say when/where the onions are used, so I added them to the paté with the mushrooms. I also did a version using a country pork paté instead of foie gras and it was crazy good.

Totally changed this up.  I used leftover prime rib that was rare.  sliced it up and added it to partially cooked mushrooms & diced summer squash.  Made a rue and added the meat and veggies to it.  In my puff pastry I spread each side with herbed cream cheese that also had garlic slivers in it.  Baked this and WOW~

Fantastic. I used "Veggie Pate" by Paula on this site for the pate. Stuck a thermometer in the meat during baking and the family LOVED it.

I'm an amateur cook and this was the most delicious wellington my guests and I say they've ever had. Sorry I didn't take a pic because the puff pastry perfect and the sauce was incredibly good!

This was very good; however, I felt that there was too much puff pastry.  Next time I make Beef Wellington I will make a whole one and slice it.  That way there will be only a small amount of the pastry for each person.  The mushroom/patte was very delicious and the pan sauce was excellent.

I made this with moose tenderloin instead of cow. Muah my fiancé loved it, I made it again for my parents! The red wine sauce elevates this already fine dish. Scrumptious

New Year's Eve dinner! Made it for 4 but made sauce and mushroom,pate mix as directed for 6. Used a cognac pate as that's all that was left at the deli. I was concerned about cooking time when the pastry didn't seem done enough but in the end came out perfectly. Everyone raved. It was absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again.

Easy breezy. Got the beef tenderloin and sliced 8-10oz. Bought the foie gras instead of frying all those other ingredients. Slabbed the pate on the filet rounds, wrapped up the servings, egged them and threw them in the oven as instructed. Excellent presentation at table and an "A" for eye appeal. Served 12 filets for 8 people and there were no leftovers! Roasted vegetables, baked potatoes, and souped up salad and it was the perfect celebratory dinner.
