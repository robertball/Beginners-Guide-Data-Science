I must admit the only reason I made this pizza is because the unusual ingredient of pumpkin intrigued me...and I wanted lunch. I like pumpkin, so I knew it wouldn't be something that just totally disgusted me. But I must say the pumpkin didn't do anything for the pizza. I made it on Joseph's Oat Bran and Whole Wheat Lavash Bread, as is my custom for a single serve pizza and then scaled down the ingredients. I tasted it first and then added salt on the top, which it needed because of the unsalted pumpkin. Not bad, and certainly a way to use up left-over Thanksgiving chicken and canned pumpkin.
