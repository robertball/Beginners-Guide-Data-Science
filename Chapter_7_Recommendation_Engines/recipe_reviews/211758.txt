Made it to the letter, however I served it over rice. I doubled the sauce, wonderful. The wife said it was a bit spicy for her(the sauce).

This was wonderful! Didn't have skewers, so I just made "meatballs" and put them in a pita with diced tomato, onion, and ketchup pretty much as recommended in the recipe. Will definitely buy more ground chicken to make more of these.

Did not cook exactly as recommended.  Sliced chicken breast instead of grinding, did not add egg or bread crumbs since I did not need to hold the meet together.  Used the sweet chili sauce and soy sauce as a marinade.  Cooked on foil on grill.  Awesome taste.  Never thought of using the sweet chili sauce for this.
