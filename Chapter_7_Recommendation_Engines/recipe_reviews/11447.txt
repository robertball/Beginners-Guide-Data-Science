These are so easy and quick. They taste like chocolate macaroons only they're crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.A very tasty cookie recipe. Nice presentation and look alot like the chocoate haystack candies sold by Sees or Purdys chocolates. Another unique recipe Corwynn. Thanks.

So good. We can't stop eating them! I wish I had doubled them. If you like coconut and you like chocolate, these are for you. Thanks.

Very fast and easy!  I didn't have any chocolate syrup, so I melted chocolate chips, and then added honey and a bit of water to the recipe.  I think it would also work if you added just oil in place of honey and/or water.  I had to leave the kitchen because I couldn't stop eating the dough...thanks for the recipe!

I was very excited to try this recipe, but sorry to say that I didn't like it.  In fact this was the 2nd time that I've ever thrown "sweets" away.  Not even my husband or kids would eat it.

Pretty good.  Definitely an interesting cookie!  Very sweet but that is to be expected.  I might try some unsweetened coconut next time.  I bet these would be good with different extracts, like almond, coconut or orange.  SO easy to make, took me probably less than 5 minutes!

These were great... I think the reviewer that said they tasted bad probably used unsweetened coconut, or maybe even used a cup of cocoa powder instead of the syrup??  Anyway, I didnt have choc. syrup myself, so I subbed hot fudge, and boy were they good!!  I'd use the fudge again next time, even though I'm sure this adds a load more fat (but who cares, its a dessert recipe!!)

Needed a Chocolate Coconut fix.  Easy, Fast and hit the spot.  Didn't have enough chocolate syrup, so I melted some Baker's chocolate and added a little sugar

These are simple and easy to make.  Min ingredients with lots of chocolate taste.  Perfect for kids bake sales.

I made these to go to a family pot luck christmas dinner ,and they were VERY easy to make. Infact I made them while my 3 month old daughter sat and watched. It was great they were so easy and not very time consuming. I made mine a little big ,so they needed more time in the oven ,but thats my blunder . I will deffinately be making these again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe !!

These were very easy to make.  I had some leftover coconut and was looking for a recipe to use it up.  Very yummy and enjoyed by all.

I came across this recipe in hopes to use up a ton of chocolate syrup that I had leftover. The kids loved them, but my husband did not like them at all. These are definitely best on the day they are made. The next day, they seemed a little rubbery. A moist cake like cookie that taste like a macaroon.  To me they are better if you flatten them out a bit before cooking.

Chewy outside, moist inside is wonderful.  The strong chocolate flavor is almost overwhelming.  I like chocolate, but this was a little too much.

I was looking forward to these, sounded so easy and yummy.  I was a little dissapointed, didn't really wow me.  I used a medium sized cookie scoop, this was clearly too big.  The cookies had to bake for several more minutes,  if I make again I will use a small cookie scoop.

I overcooked mine a tad so it might have had an effect on my 4 star rating. These are pretty good...they are certainly quick & easy enough. I think next time I will add a tbp. or two of sweetened condensed milk. The real test will come when my macaroon loving husband tastes them.
