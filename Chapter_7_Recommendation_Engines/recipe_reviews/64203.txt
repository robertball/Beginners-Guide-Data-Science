Everyone loved this.  I had many requests for the recipe.  I didn't even bother looking for the Near Asia Pilaf mix because I was pretty sure I've never seen it.  Instead I cooked minute rice in a combination of beef broth, cayanne pepper, curry powder, vinegar and soy sauce.  It turned out great!

This is such an awesome dish and so open to "freestyling" it -adding or removing as your imagination or whatever in your fridge guides you. I actually love to serve it hot as a side dish. Love the colors too.

Living in Japan, I haven't seen Near East brand anything, but I made this using some leftover fried rice I had made with ham, shiso and oyster sauce instead of the pilaf mix.  It was great! And rice being filling, we had some leftover, so we got three days of enjoyment from one batch of fried rice.  This recipe was still great the next day.

Good, but a bit too salty. The peanuts and pinenuts (from the package) together were a bit too much.
