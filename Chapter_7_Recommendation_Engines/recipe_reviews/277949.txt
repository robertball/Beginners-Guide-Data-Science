Amazing recipe! Added more stock to make it more of a soup. (Be careful with stock in your area. In Australia it is quite salty so I did not need to add extra salt as in the video.) Highly recommended!

I made Chef's Pasta Fagioli for my Italian fiancee tonight! I didn't have the ear pasta so I snapped off one inch segments of fettuccine and also substituted the Swiss chard for spinach. Turned out amazing!

Excellent!  I did not add any salt as bacon has plenty.  Also left the bean juice in as opposed to the cup of water for more flavor.

Great recipe!!!! I added a can of diced tomatoes and extra stock. Recipe was quick, easy and my family loved it! I have a few recipes handed down from my Italian grandmother and aunts who would all be proud of this delicious soup!!!

Another Chef John WINNER! I made this (substituted Italian sausage for bacon, collards for Swiss chard, black-eyed peas for cannellini beans) and it turned out fantastic! Very flavorful and satisfying. Thank you Chef John for this and all of your excellent recipes that enrich so many lives!

Very Tasty!  I grow fresh herbs, so I used them instead of the dried.  I couldn't find the orecchiette pasta in the grocery store so just used small macaroni that I had on hand.   Also I had some spinach that I needed to use up so substituted that for the swiss chard.  All in all, it turned out great!!!  I froze the leftovers so we could enjoy this soup on another rare cold day in Florida!  Thanks Chef John, again, for providing me with a tasty recipe!

I love this soup!  I made just two changes.  I substituted sweet Italian sausage for the bacon, and I substituted 8 oz. of fresh baby spinach for the chard.  It was great served with hot rolls.

Absolutely loved this dish, only thing different for me was I used spinach and a bit more than a pinch of cayenne as we like spicy food. Thanks John

Soooo good, I put black beans in as they are a little more hearty, and a splash of red wine.. Everyone loved it.
