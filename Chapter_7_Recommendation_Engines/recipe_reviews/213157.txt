I rate this as 3.5 stars.  The casserole structure makes this dish crowd-friendly, and it is an easy enough recipe for a beginner.  However, I took off a half star because there was excess liquid after baking (the tortillas absorb it after refrigerating, but fresh from the oven it creates an unappetizing appearance).  And 1 full star off because the Italian dressing gives an unpleasant tangy taste - it absolutely does not blend with the dish.  I think the intent was to imitate the tanginess of lime (typical to Mexican cuisine) with a more common ingredient, but next time I will use 2 Tbsp fajita/taco seasoning with a squeeze of lime/lemon juice to replace the Italian dressing & chile pepper.  Also recommend adding some sliced olives to the top layer.

This makes for a very easy, healthy and yummy supper. I had to modify the recipe though. The Italian Dressing would not fly with my husband, not at all. I changed the salsa to one can of diced tomatoes, and the Italian dressing to taco mix flavouring. I didn't use any sour cream, but layered in chopped up yellow, red and green peppers. Husband friendly and can be made, portioned and frozen to use as needed for lunches. Thanks for the great meal recipe!

This was delicious!  My husband and I both really liked it.  I would have to completely disagree with the reviewers who said the Italian dressing wasn't good in it. It was just fine, and blended in well with the flavours. You can't taste the dressing distinctly, it just adds to the overall flavour.  Also I used the exact amount of chili powder in the recipe, and it was perfect.  I will be making this again!  Hopefully with the black beans next time (didn't have any so made it without them) =)

I made a commitment to cook at home more & this recipe made it really easy.  I did modify the recipe by not adding the Italian dressing.  Substituted 1 tablespoon of chili powder with cumin & added chopped jalapenos.  Really good.

We've have this twice.  My 7yo loves it, and eat it up.  He doesn't like beans and onions, but he cleans his plate every time we have this for dinner!  It's great as a lunch the next day (my husband has have to fight people off his lunch when they smell it and an see it).

This casserole has become a staple in my Once a Month cooking rotation. It freezes well, and tastes great even a few months later. I like the beans, and have started adding black beans to taco meat in other recipes to stretch it out and add nutrition.

Great dish!  Had my super picky sister & brother-in-law over and they both had second helpings and even took some home.  I did make a few adjustments...I used ground turkey instead of beef, only used 1 tablespoon chili powder and added a few dashes of cumin and one cup frozen corn.  I baked mine in stoneware and had no excess water or crunchy tortillas.  Will be making this dish again.

This was the first casserole I've ever made and it was fantastic.  I actually substituted 12 baked corn tortillas for the flour tortillas.  It was delicious!!  And super easy.

This was really good as a base. I didn't add the dressing, and added enough salsa to saturate the beef. I also used cumin instead of chili powder, but I think either is just as good. Very yummy and I will make this again.

Our family loved the Layered Enchilada Bake!  I cut the amount of chili powder in half so it was not to spicy. Put lettuce and tomato on top too!  Great recipe!

Excellent!  Used less chili powder as per previous reviewers, a little more sour cream and cheese in the layers and served with a big dab of sour cream topped with chopped green onion and diced tomatoes.  Also minced up a couple of garlic cloves with the onion.

This was delicious!  I added some refried beans on the tortillas and sprinlked some onion and black olives on the sour cream.  We decided our family is calling it "Mexican Lasagna"!!

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was different.  I used a homemade salsa and taco seasoning rather than Italian dressing.  (This was after reading other reviews.)  I agree with others that it doesn't make the best presentation, but it does go together quickly and is pretty tasty.  For us, it's good comfort food in the winter.

This has been around for a long time, but continues to be a "fan favorite" at our house.  Some variations are always available with the layering of the dish.  Have used a layer of re-fried beans, or Spanish Rice to add some texture, but the basic build as suggested in the original receipt is a winner.  For hunters..this is a great way to use your ground venison.

This was very good, but I made some changes. There is a ''cottage cheese chicken enchilada'' recipe on that site that is one of my new favorites, so I kind of mixed these two recipes together. I boiled and shredded some chicken for the meat mixture. I added minced garlic and taco season to the meat as well as the onion (after i boiled the chicken and shredded it, I mixed these ingredients in a skillet). Instead of just using sour cream, i mixed sour cream and cottage cheese and this was the layer I used for the top of the meat mixture. I left out the Italian dressing. I topped it with some sliced black olives and tomatoes. It was very good. My s.o. gave this four stars! I think I will be making this again for the 'rents as well. :)

I made this for my family and we really enjoyed it.  I didnt add the Zesty Italian dressing as some had suggested, and I used 1 cup salsa and 1 can diced tomatoes instead of the 2 cups salsa.  I also chopped up some lettuce and let everyone put it on top of it which made a huge difference.  I think it needed a little more sour cream so next time I make it Im going to add just a little more and I also want to try olives on it as well.  All in all it was a great starter recipe!

This was a quick, easy and delicious meal! I changed a couple of items, instead of black beans I used leftover homemade chili beans and I omitted the Italian dressing altogether. I mixed taco seasoning in with the sour cream and used colby-jack cheese. Lastly, I topped it off with green onion. My family (hubby and two young boys) had this dish along with grilled corn on the cob, it was a winner! I will certainly make this again, thanks for the recipe!

the recipe itself wasn't bad but we made a few modifications and then we loved it! instead of using the italian dressing we used half a pack of beef taco seasoning and less salsa we also added medium chopped chili peppers. for the sour cream and cheese instead of layering them we mixed the sour cream cheese and the rest of the taco seasoning. we also used corn tortillas instead of flour since we like the corn better at our house. after all of the changes it was delicious!

I love this recipe! I make it all the time but I substitute taco seasoning for the chili powder. This is a really great recipe and everyone in my family likes it. It's really good to experiment with, too. Sometimes we put in turkey, or chunks of chicken, sometimes even chunks of beef. I think all of the ingredients blend well together, and the mix stuff you make is so good you could eat it straight from the pan! This is one of those recipes that is very good the first time you have it, and it's even better when it's leftover.????

My husband thought they were okay but my brother and I thought they were delicious. I added the taco mix also and turned them into burritos instead.

We really liked this recipe. A few things I changed: I put in a little additional italian dressing, a tablespoon of chile powder, and 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning. I also put olives in with the layers and I would put the sour cream in with the meat/bean mixture instead of on top. All in all, definitely a keeper!

If you're looking for Tex-Mex flavor, you'll need to kick up this recipe quite a bit.  I made it per the recipe, and found it to be bland and dry.  Next time I will add cayenne pepper- probably a teaspoon, and a can or two of enchilada sauce on top before topping with the rest of the cheese.  Not bad...
