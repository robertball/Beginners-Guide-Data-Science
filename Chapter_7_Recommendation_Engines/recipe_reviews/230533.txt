My husband is active duty military and we had Moose Milk at his command Christmas party. It is a Canadian Navy tradition and was a great hit at the party. We made this version at home and it is good version. We will make it again, but follow the Canadians version and substitute the vodka for light or white rum. We also used our immersion blender to really whip it up. We served it with a scoop of ice cream and garnished with a dash of nutmeg.

@ Cookin' Sailor I am actually Canadian and we've always used vodka and rum as well as the coffee flavoured liqueur! Of course I am from the East Coast and we Maritimers like our booze, maybe more so than the West Coast! :D

My husband and I adjusted the recipe down to 3 servings (!), and reduced the alcohol to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup. Yes, we're a bit wimpy, and we don't like to get drunk! It must be terribly strong made the original way, because it is strong like this. We love it, and are celebrating 25 years! Happy Valentine's Day!

Great recipe - I was also a base brat and remember seeing punch bowls full of it at the New Year's Levees in the Officer's Mess.  It's definitely a Canadian Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air and Legion) tradition - I've even given the recipe to Americans who were here for service.  I've also replaced the vodka with butterscotch liquor as I didn't have vodka the one time - super yummy!

I made a lighter version of this, just ice cream kahlua and milk.  It was so delicious we had it multiple times!
