Oh my goodness, this was bananas. I used fresh red peppers, onions and a mess of garlic instead of using frozen and I used Chipotle Tabasco. I served this with bacon and fruit salad. Thumbs up from all four of us. Crazy good. I loved how cheap this was to make. Really impressed. WTG, southernshoe! You impressed the socks off of me.

Fun and easy recipe!  Made this with the left over cornbread from Mom's Sweet Buttermilk Corn Bread recipe on this site.  So many different things you can do with this such different veggies or meats.  When the cornbread soaks up the juices from the cooking of the sausage it makes it really good.

This was pretty good; I skipped the oil, used fresh bell pepper and some spring onions and a couple mushrooms that I needed to use up (cooked them with the sausage) and added some muenster cheese with the eggs. While the eggs are being folded in with the sausage-cornbread mixture, it is a globby mess but the ingredients parse themselves out again after the egg is cooked. I may try again with a stronger cheese.

This was a delicious dish. I had to serve a group of men so I use two dozen eggs, 1 pound of bacon, 1 pound of zesty breakfast sausage, two red bell peppers, One onion, One and ahalf boxes of Jiffy corn bread mix. I forgot to put milk in the eggs which I will do next time. I cook the cornbread and the meat the night before. Reheated the meat cooked the peppers and onions that morning and mix everything together.

My husband and I made this without green pepper just a couple mini red peppers, added mixed shredded cheese to melt all on top of it. Tastes like an awesome hillbilly quiche. Topped it finally with Valentino Mexican hot sauce.

Great way to use up day old corn bread! Used ham, since had in the house and used fresh bell pepper and onion which I sautéed in olive oil. Forgot to add cheese, but served with salsa.

First off, I had no corn bread at my disposal, which I'm sure makes the recipe very different. I took one of those Costco Torta rolls, microwaved the water out, and threw it in a food processor. No peppers either so just onions with jalapeños and spinach. I also used habenero sausage, but really any meat would work well. It was still great and a very filling breakfast, and I'm excited to try it with corn bread next time!

My goodness. I never thought cornbread could  turn into such a delightful meal. This recipe is wonderful. I didn't use the oil recommended and I did fry up fresh red peppers and onions with the sausage. I now have to make more cornbread to repeat this recipe.  Very easy, delicious and a a new recipe for my rotation which my family has already requested.

Very good!  I also used fresh green pepper and onion that I fried with the sausage.  I was afraid after I added the eggs that it was going to be a complete mess, but turned out fine after it continued to cook for awhile.

My family gobbled it up.  I didn't add any meat as I didn't have any on hand.  I used fresh peppers and onions.
