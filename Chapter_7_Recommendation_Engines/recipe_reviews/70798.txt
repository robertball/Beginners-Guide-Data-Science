I make this recipe, but I do mine different--here is what I do! Instead of Marshmallow cream I use 1 cup of sour cream. Mix the cream cheese and sour cream together add 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Mix all this. Then add your grapes, fold the grapes into cream cheese mixture. transfer this mixture into your serving dish. Before you go to serve the salad top it with 1/3 cup of brown sugar, sprinkle it on top of grape salad. You can then top it with almonds or I use pecans. this is the best recipe! It is a very refreshing snack or dessert! even my children love it!! You'll be glad you made this one!!

YUM!! This was excellent! Messy to make, but worth it! I mixed the cream cheese & marshmallow cream w/my mixer-MUCH easier + you don't get clumps of cream cheese. We aren't fans of anything w/nuts but I had to try it, & oh my!! I happened to use pecans & it was incredible-nuts in this are a must! I thought it looked great too(not sure why others didn't so). As soon as I set it on the table, everyone ooohed & ahhhed. I may add a little whipped cream next time just to thin it out a bit because it is sticky & thick. Oh-I weighed out my grapes AFTER pulling stems, picking thru, & rinsing & seemed to be a perfect ratio of ingredienst. If anything, maybe could've added a few more grapes. Thank you for a great recipe!! UPDATE: If you're not serving imediately, take along some whipped cream to stir in just before serving. Once it sits awhile, it does get kind of ugly:) The whipped cream brings it back to life & it should last throughout the meal, even on a buffet line.

As I was making this salad I took a nibble and instantly decided that it would be in everyones best interest if I served it at the END of the meal.  I was right, it was such a hit that I know it will be a family favorite from now on.

Oh, how simple, and oh, how delicious.  The key to putting this over the top: TOAST those almonds!  Pop 'em in the toaster oven or toss in a saute pan until golden brown; the taste intensifies and really makes this salad perfect.  Yummy and simple and different and super-easy to make.  This dish does not keep well, though--serve it within a few hours of making it; the sauce gets runny.

Very yummy!  I used nefuchatel (sp?) cheese instead of cream cheese and added 1.5 tbsp of vanilla.  I used all green grapes as that is what I had and omitted the nuts as I didn't have them.  I used just shy of 4 cups of small grapes.  The 'dressing' is delicious and would have liked more of it so next time I'll cut back on the grapes.  Thanks for a great salad!

Nice, different.  I took it to a brunch and was asked for the recipe.  I think next time I will try it with peanuts instead (or without nuts for my allergic daughter).

What an excellant tasting salad. Made this with 2-1/4 lbs of the grapes, red & green. When making this salad, be sure you weigh the grapes after removing them from the stems, and before you add them to the salad, to make sure you have exactly 2 lbs. I didn't add the slivered almonds though, as I much prefer the salad without them.

The recipe was very easy to prepare.  It was very good but only in a smal portion because it is a bit rich.

my grandma's good friend used to make this a lot and she used sour cream instead of marshmallow cream and it is SO good - very light & refreshing.  you do add a little sugar, but it's not too sweet.  just a suggestion if you want to unsweeten this a bit!

Incredible! Easy to make and so darn good :) I exchanged half the marshmallow creme with sour cream and toasted some pecan halves in butter then lightly salted them for the nuts instead of almonds. Everyone loved this. It would be hard to mess this recipe up!

What an easy, delicious "dessert" salad.  It was served at a tailgate party and had to make it myself.  I used the reviewer's suggestion to substitute sour cream, sugar and vanilla for the marshmallow cream.  Fantastic!!

Excellent summertime dessert.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and this was still rich and very good. I toasted the almonds too. I definitely think of this as a dessert and not a fruit salad side dish - it's very sweet for that.  Will make this again for sure.

A Total Hit! at Thanksgiving. All I did was use less almonds as topping. Little kids have a thing about crunchy-fluffy-sweet stuff. If it is just adults, please rock this recipe as is.

Wow, this is so easy to eat!  :)  It's a great combination of sweet and juicy, basically grape tossed with a fruit dip.  We seemed to have more dip than we needed for the grapes, but that might have been loose measuring.  Will probably make again for a light dessert or for a luncheon salad.  MMmmm.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This is very sweet. I think I might like it better on berries, as well as with grapes. We prefer it without the nuts.

This is Yummy. The Marshmallow and Cream Cheese are perfect – sweet and creamy without being too sweet. We made the Grape Salad which is delicious and then we made just a batch of the Marshmallow and Cream Cheese with a ½ tsp of Vanilla as a dip for a large fruit bowl appetizer that had various melons, grapes and graham crackers – it was completely wiped out! Kids and Adults both loved it, and it was so simple.

This salad was awesome!!  I have a heck of a time getting my family to eat their fruits, and when I make a batch of this salad it does not last a day!!  I did modify the recipe to add peanuts instead of almonds as it does taste much like a caramel apple.

I made this for a work luncheon and got rave reviews on it.
The only thing I didn't do that I would do differently the next time is to use a mixer to blend the cream cheese and the marshmallow. I ended up using the ice cream marshmallow topping because I couldn't find the marshmallow creme at my store.

Here's a variation I hadn't seen yet - my co-worker gave me this recipe - (she uses pecans instead of almonds), and she adds just enough SHREDDED CHEDDAR CHEESE to give it some contrasting color.  Yes, it sounds disgusting, but it really is good! (think of how cheese and grapes and wine go together so well?)

My kids LOVE THIS and they don't like fruit much. I've already made it twice this month!  I plan to try it with peanuts sometime - makes me think of peanut butter and jelly.

yum! I usually use red grapes only, and I like pecans or walnuts better than almond.

Mmm so good and addicting! Made without the almonds. I also added a touch of cool whip and I must admit, I love it best with the cool whip.

A great recipe, always a big hit. I've been asked for the recipe on several occasions. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe; so easy and can be made in advance. As a side note, this does makes a lot of salad.

Great, I did not have marshmallow creme; so I used made and used one box of 'cook and serve' tapioca pudding and added about 1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows to the grapes.

So delicous! it was a total hit! I also used cream cheese sugrar and vanilla.... but only because I forgot the marshmellow creme. Will try it the other way next time.
Keep it cold, otherwise it gets runy. Still tasty just ugly :)

Just tried this recipe for the first time a couple of weeks ago and have already brought it to three different get-togethers (not including the one I'm getting ready to make it for).  Everyone asks what's in it and then it's followed by... "can I get the recipe?".  This is a great, refreshing, different side to bring.  It's my 12 year old's new "must have" for any/all occasions!

Tasted this at a family reunion last August and asked for the recipe and found out it was from All Recipes.  It is super easy and I have since taken it to several covered dish dinners.  It is always a hit and no one can believe how easy it is to make.  Love this and would fix it more often, but my diabetic husband can't stay out of it so I only make it when I can take it out of the house.

I cut this in half for just my boys. I used low-fat cream cheese and vegan fluff. They fell in love with it. I bet it would be just as good with pecans.

I have been making the recipe for several years. I add 1/4 cup orange juice & a touch of vanilla to the creme cheese marshmallow mix, it thins it out just enough and is very refreshing. Of course as everyone knows this dessert is a hit

Love this grape salad.  I add apples oranges and other fruit.  I try to pack it full of fruit because it is so sweet.  I put twice as much fruit as it called for.

This is the best grape salad!!  It's so easy and delicious.  It's better if you use toasted nuts in the salad.  I make this whenever grapes are on sale!

So yummy!  I first made it with cream cheese and a whole container of cool whip, but I think the next time I make it I am going to use the marshmellow.  Either way, yummy.  It doesn't look all that pretty, but it sure is good!

What a lovely little dish. So quick and easy too. I liked the crunch the nuts gave this and the marshmallow creme was really good in this. I think I added a little extra though as the "sauce" comes out stringy. I used neufchatel instead of cream cheese. Very good and makes a nice light dessert. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy!  Really easy and unique!  I added shelled, chopped pistachio meats in place of the almonds.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and it was just as good as the full fat.  This definitely tastes best when it sits a bit and is nicely chilled.  Great recipe!

Easy, Easy!
I made this to take to my Garden Club luncheon.
It was very good.  I did use pecans because I had them on hand.  I also cut the grapes in half, but probably woudn't bother to do that.
It is important to have the cream cheese at room temperature for ease of mixing.  Unlike other folks, I did not think this salad was
unattractive!

Excellent!!!  I prepared this for a potluck lunch and EVERYONE wanted the recipe!!  I only had 1/2 lb. of red grapes so I added a can of drained mandarin oranges and it tasted wonderful. I also didn't use the nuts.  So easy to make and great tasting!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I make something similar to this usually, but opted for this recipe which contains the marshmallow creme.  While I am not a big fan of marshmallow normally, the cream cheese really tones down the stickiness of the marshmallow cream.  I prefer to omit the almonds and sprinkle the top of the salad with brown sugar and pecans!! YUM!

Does not make a very "pretty" dish, but boy is it tasty! I omitted the almonds & added a small can of manderin oranges.

Love, love, love.  My kids make this after school with a 50/50 mix of fluff/cream cheese...no nuts though.  About 1 Tablespoon of each.  We also serve at dinner for a light finish.  Another so simple so good recipe.

I used this recipe as a base.  I used everything but the marshmallow fluff.  I thought it would be way too sweet and sticky, so i subst. cool whip.  Was light in some bites and rich and creamy with the cream cheese (left in small chunks) in others.  Fiance` loved it.  Then i made again same way, but with pecans.  If you like nuts, use other kinds, and not slivered.  You dont get the full texture effect with slivered.

I used chopped pecans instead of almonds.  I also add an 8 ounce tub of whipped topping to the marshmallow creme and cream cheese mixture.  I've also made this recipe with other fruits besides grapes.  A wonderful recipe.

This was fantastic and very rich. I added a third variety of grapes for more interesting colors and garnished with purple flowers (clematis), chive blossoms, and roses--the colors were beautiful and looked great on a buffet.

Pretty straight forward. Made it for Easter for something different. Was well received. Messy and definitely needed some upper arm strength for stirring but I would make it again.

My family quickly devoured this recipe. This was too quick and ubber simple to go wrong anywhere in this recipe. With only a few ingredients....a fabulous recipe in a flash. I creamed together Greek Cream Cheese and Marshmallow Cream in my KA and then folded in my grapes and added in additional pint of strawberries because the recipe does make a lot of fluff and adding the strawberries was perfect. Rather then adding the almonds into the mixture, I left it out to top each persons serving, whether they wanted a little or a lot it was more their choice due to their own preferences. I will make again especially when needing to use up extra fruit that needs to be eaten and not wasted. I will be making again TY

Loved the salad. I did substitute about half of the marshmallow cream for lemon yoghurt.  It was very nice with the toasted almonds and I found it held well overnight and was great for breakfast!

Changed up the recipe, because I used what I had on hand in the kitchen. I substituted Vanilla Greek yogurt for the marshmallow fluff. Also substituted crushed walnuts in my version and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the mix at the end. The best grape salad I have tasted!

Did exactly and it was way to sweet for us. So we could eat it we then added a granny smith apple, still sweet so added celery.  With the changes we'd rate a 4.  I think next time we'll try other peoples suggestions and substitute either the marshmallow cream with cool whip or the cream cheese with sour cream.  This is strictly for our own tastes because it was so sweet, nothing wrong otherwise.  TIP:  do use the tip given earlier on using a mixer to cream the marshmallow cream and the cream cheese.  My mixer still had a hard time but plowed through it.

I have made this salad/dessert several times and rather than Marshmellow cream used Cool Whip.  so good!  You need to make sure that after you wash the grapes that they are completely dry!

I made this for Valentine Day dinner---for DESSERT:) It went over very well with guests.  I used marshmellow cream and sour cream, seemed to work great, and was easier to "blend".  Almonds great in it too.  Of course, we had to have a chocolate heart on the side:)

I make it as a fruit dip!  I mix the cream cheese with jar of marshmallow, then I make a platter of fruits.  You dip your fruit into it, yum!  Everyone always asks me to bring it to parties.

Try Greek yogurt and agave to taste, instead--delicious and elegant. And absolutely toast the nuts --and thank you, reviewer who added cinnamon, vanilla, etc .--really kicks it up a notch.

This recipe is a favorite of my husband, who does not eat much fruit. I added finely chopped celery and small slivers of pineapple for a different taste and to add more nutrition to the recipe.

I have to agree with other posters..this is not a very attractive salad.  The grapes I felt would be better cut in half.  Also..the marshmallow and cream
cheese..is better served alone..and used as a dip with a variety of fruits.
Probably will not make this recipe again.

Delicious. I added a tiny bit of milk to thin it as the mixture came out a little thick. More of a dessert than a salad, but yummy just the same!

This salad is grape heaven!!  I definitely recommend this salad to anyone who loves grapes.  I left out the nuts, simply because I was serving it to many ladies.  Even still, it was a huge hit, and so yummy.

This is delicious.  I will, however, cut down the portions considerably next time as it makes an enormous amount.  Just like a fruit dip, just all mixed together.  Wonderful!

Love it! I made it as directed except used the oven roasted slivered almonds they make for salads; in the future I would perhaps not put the nuts in the salad as they get soft, but serve them on top of each individual serving. The cream cheese and marshmallow fluff are great and I think you could use the same mixture and use different fruit. I like grapes, but my husband doesn't. If I put in some strawberries and apples and bananas or oranges, he would really like it. Great simple fast recipe. As a bonus, I get my fruit plus some sweet.

I tried this as written plus I also made one with mandarin oranges. The mandarin oranges produced too much juice but would work well as a trifle with whipped cream and angel food cake. The grapes were great. I can't wait to try this with other fruit too.

I thought this was really good and the people that tried it raved, so I would give it 5 stars....but I served it to 23 people and had at least 1/2 leftover(just made 1 batch!) so obviously people were unsure based on looks and didnt bother to try it. Which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars.

This was so easy, everyone went bonkers over it, and they were surprised to hear how simple it is. Very versatile, it would be good with almost any fruit. I added the almonds, but it didn't really need them.

We made this to take to another couple's house last night, and everyone gave it two thumbs up. It was perfect for a night when we all wanted something sweet, but light. Like another reviewer, I added a few mandarin organges. I also used sliced instead of slivered almonds so that we got a little bit of the nut-skin and its yummy flavor, and I taosted them in the oven for 7 minutes at 250 F. Our friends said that the almonds "made" the dish.

I thought this was delicious and PERFECT for summer.  I used toasted pecans instead of almonds, just because we like those better.  Next time I might try adding coconut.  I loved the taste of the cream cheese and fluff together.  Thank you!!

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and the family loved it! The topping really clings to the grapes so you don't have to scrape around for the sweet filling. I used walnuts instead of almonds.

I’ve made this salad several times.  The first couple of times, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Then I decided to try it with pecans.  The type of nut is the only change I’ve made, I perfer the pecans in this over the almonds.  For those who say they make this recipe but instead of marshmallow cream, I use sour cream and withe granulated sugar, well then...you didn’t make THIS recipe.  As is this salad is delicious.

I made this recipe tonight. I used chopped walnut since that was the type of nut I had on hand. It was a very hot night and my friends loved this salad. The next time I make it I believe I will serve it as a dessert.
Very easy to make and very difficult to mess up. My kind of recipe!

I've been making this for a few years now and always get rave reviews and no leftovers.  The only thing I would recommend is to always toast the almonds first, it makes them a bit more crunchy and the flavor gets enhanced tremendously. I do use sliced almonds in lieu of the slivered though.

This is very similar to a fruit dip.  I didn't have two lbs. of grapes so I had plenty of dip to cover my grapes. But that's the best part of it.  Also, used pecans.

I made this for a funeral luncheon, so I only got as small taste of it.  It's very easy to make.  I didn't find it to be terribly sweet, and I was surprised that the dressing is as thick as it is.  If I made it again I would consider thinning it with a bit of milk, especially since it hardens more on chilling.  I forgot to toast the almonds before mixing them with the grapes, but I did save about a third of them for topping, and I toasted them.  I think toasting the almonds gives them better flavor and color.  This is a nice salad that's different, easy, and tastes good.

The recipe sounds great. I was reading where one poster was complaining about using olive oil spray, saving calories and fat. A few day ago everyone was complaining  about all the fat, calories, and sodium in a recipe. You just can't win. Although I must say I've never heard a complaint before about cutting them back.I put this under the wrong recipe it should be with the baked asparagus.
