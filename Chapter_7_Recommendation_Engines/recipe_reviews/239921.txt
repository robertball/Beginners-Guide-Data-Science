Very easy. If you want a chocolate cake in mug, you got. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used regular a/p mixed with 1/4 tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt. This worked fine, though my cake rose about 4 inches out of the mug creating a rather wild look. It was perfectly done at 2.5 mins for me. My advice is to use a very big mug:)

I loved this!  Made it today for my son and myself.  Perfect amount for two.  I used a glass bowl because it's a bigger recipe than an average mug can hold.  I also split the white sugar in half and added brown sugar to make up for it.  I microwaved mine for two minutes.  It was done perfectly.  Threw some ice cream on top and I was in pregnancy heaven.

I’ve made this nutella mug cake quite a few times now and not just for me but others too and it’s a great recipe. I only add half the amount of sugar and I don’t add the Nutella until the very end. I don’t mix in the Nutella I just drop it into the batter and leave it as is creating a lava cake when it’s finished in the microwave.

This is very good and definitely makes enough for two. It is so easy to make when you want a treat. Word of caution though, a large mug won't cut it. I make this in a four cup glass measuring cup and it works great without exploding over the edge in the microwave. Put a scoop of ice cream on top and you are good to go.

This is definitely a generous recipe....enough for two to four people. I couldn't finish this on my own. I substituted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and cut back the sugar by a third. It's pretty dense and I cooked it for 2.5mins as another user suggested. Turned out pretty good, but I think it does need something to top it off like a syrup or scoop or ice cream.  Otherwise super quick and easy to prepare. Would make again to satisfy a sweet craving.

I love this recipe! My other half is allergic to chocolate and cocoa, so I subbed the 3tbsp of cocoa powder for plain flour, used peanut butter instead of nutella, and a drop of vanilla essence. Beautiful!

Delicious! Divided into two mugs and cooked each for 1 minute, then served with vanilla ice cream:D My husband said we should sell them for 2 dollars a mug, and scraped the mugs completely clean with a fork! XD

Not worth 1000 calories!  Followed recipe exactly. Has a very rich cocoa flavor but odd texture and not very sweet for 1/4 cup of sugar! And 60+ fat grams and over 1000 calories? Rather eat a candy bar!

This is a good chocolately cake and enough for 3 people easily.  I made it in my 2 cup glass measure cup. It rose over the top while cooking but settled down to the 2 cup mark when cool.  We served with whipped cream.  I would make again for sure.

Going with 4 stars because it is cooking at the moment. The batter was amazing tasting. So... I have a specific mug (x2) that I use for mug cakes. Now these mugs can hold 2 to 3 times a recipe so when doing a new one I always double it. Well as I made this one I barely got 5 down and ran out of room in the muh to mix (which NEVER happens!) and I had to actually yransfer to a bowl. So, Im standing here mixing away and the bowl is about to over flow and I still have to add milk and oil! (Microwave just beeped its done!) So I transfer again and finish filling the mug almost to the rim. Nuke it and picture is my results after 4 minutes! Will have to split in 2 and re nuke!

Made this as listed except used all purpose flour and 1/4tsp baking powder.  Cooked for about 2.5 mins on 100% power in a 900 watt microwave. Also found was easier to stir in bowl and then transfer to a buttered mug. It's a very rich and decadent dessert. Will hit spot if looking for cake but don't want bake cake. Diffidently should share this with another. Ensure have big glass milk with it. Thought had good chocolate flavor.

If you fill a mug to much, it will rise and over flow. This recipe is a little too large for only one average mug. So you can put it in a larger MICROWAVE SAFE bowl, or spilt it into 2 mugs. If you want this cake to decorate and takeout of the mug, cook it a little more than just done so it is a little firmer, and grease all sides of the mug with olive oil or butter or whatever you typically use

Tastes great, but WAY too much for one person.  And there's no "mug" big enough.  Fortunately, I read the post about  using a 4 cup glass measuring cup.

this is delicious. My daughter (10) has made other recipes of these but this was the best. It made two mugs of cake and we were careful to not overcook -- slightly pudding like in the bottom. Wow delicious!

I cooked for 90 secs and it spilled outside the mug. Even though it still tastes pretty good. Was easy to make.

This was super great! I had to substitute self rising flour with 1/4 cup regular flour and some cream of tartar/salt/baking soda. I also substituted baking coca with hot chocolate mix. cooked for 2.5 minutes~

If you don't have self-rising flour, add a dash each of baking powder and salt. I like to slightly undercook my mug cake, so that it's still a bit fudgey and wet in the middle. I give it a mush, and it's kind of like the inside of a cake pop! Seriously good stuff.

I like it, great if you are too lazy to make an oven cake. I split it into two parts, half of the recipe is more than enough for a regular cup.
