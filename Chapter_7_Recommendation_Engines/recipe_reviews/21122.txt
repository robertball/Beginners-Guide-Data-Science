This recipe is awesome!!  We all loved it, even my one-year old.  (I did cut back on the hot pepper sauce).  I put the chili powder (and a little less) into the sauce and used a mix of 2% and 1% milk.  I used more pasta too, probably 2.5 cups and I could have used more, but I like an extra cheesey, saucey sauce opposed to a drier sauce.  We had broccoli with this and spooned some of the extra sauce over that.  I used radiatore pasta in this and it was wonderful.  Shredded my own parm, used Tillamook Pepperjack and Tillamook Extra Sharp Reserve White Cheddar cheese.  Used a bit extra of all the cheeses.  LOVED it!!!  I used crushed garlic croutons in place of bread crumbs and butter.  We couldn't get enough.  I will make this again.

I made this tonight as a test for a dinner party next weekend.    1. I used 2% instead of whole milk.  Do not do this as it breaks and makes for a chalky texture.  2. I used pepper cheddar instead of pepper jack since I had it on hand; probably no significant difference.  3. The pasta amount is definitely a typo.  I used more like 2.5 cups.  4. Personally, the hot sauce heat level was fine or too low, but I did not love the vinegar aspect it added.  Next time I will do a combo of jalapenos and cayenne.   5. I will add more mustard next time and mix the chili powder into the sauce.  6. I added parmesan to the bread crumb/butter mixture and melted in the microwave instead of in a pan. Worked beautifully and saved me a dish to wash.  Overall, this is a really good recipe.  I may just have a piggy husband, but 8 servings is debatable.

Hyperpuppy, I bow to your cooking genius.  How I wish I could give this one ten stars.  It is that good, folks.  If you like traditional comfort food with a big twist, this is your ticket right here.  I added some Oscar Mayer bacon bits. For my own personal tastes the next time I make this, I will add another 1/2 cup milk.  I will also add the chili powder to the cheese mixture. I think I tasted too much chili powder.  Otherwise this is my favorite recipe from this webstie.

I thought this recipe came out REALLY dry. After second thought, I'm not really sure why the baking time was so long--I think that's what dried out the cheese. Kinda disappointing texture after seeing the great reviews. Next time, I'll add alot more cheese and cook less because I did really love how spicy it was.

This is awesome mac & cheese! I made it for our group of adult friends and they've requested it again and again. I use 1 box of pasta, thinking the 1 1/2 cups of pasta on the recipe must be a typo.

As I'm eating leftovers for the third day in a row on this one, I have to say, this was delicious.  I accidentally doubled the mustard, but it still turned out great, and I did use a whole box of pasta after seeing the reviews and noting how much sauce I had.  Delicious.  I'm on the mission to create the perfect mac & cheese, so I'll continue experimenting, but this was a perfect start to me and I'm pumped to use some of the ingredients here.  Also - I used a combo of panko and italian breadcrumbs for the topping.  Delish!

This was amazing - the compliment I got was "steakhouse worthy".  I did use 1% and 2% milk instead of whole, and I left off the crumb topping and instead put a little extra cheese on top (left off the extra butter and added the red pepper to the mac).  Towards the end of the baking, I turned on the broiler to get a nice brown/crispy layer.  Had great flavor and will DEFINITELY make again!

This makes an excellent change from basic mac&cheese.  I used about 3/4 of a box of elbow macaroni, then cut the hot sauce down to 1 teaspoon and added a can of Rotel tomatoes to compensate...yum!  This reheats well with an extra splash of milk.  Next time I'll leave off the breadcrumbs since I don't think that really added anything, and throw in some ground beef for a complete meal.

Great variation on the regular mac n'cheese.  I was actually surprised that my kids liked it, even though it was somewhat spicy.  And adults loved it.

This was a nice twist on regular mac and cheese!  The spice in the sauce was really good and the chili powder mixed in the bread crumbs was a nice compliment.   I made the recipe as is except I used a one lb box of elbow macaroni and increased the pepper jack to 1-1/2 cups.  I'll definitely make again.

Actually 4 1/2, but that's not an option.  I've been searching for the perfect mac n'cheese recipe for YEAR.   This recipe is ALMOST perfect.  I'm still searching for a CREAMY mac and cheese and haven't found it yet, but the flavors in this one are perfect!

Awesome flavor, super rich.... WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE, either half the liquids/sauce ingredients or double your pasta. (Plus yellow mustard worked out fine as a sub for dry mustard)

I usually don't rate recipes because I change them so much, but made this last night it was wonderful, like things with a kick to it.  Did use panko bread crumbs and ceyanne pepper for the topping.  Will make again.

I used macaroni (about 2 cups cooked) and soy milk.   I was worried it would be too hot/spicy, so I cut down on the pepperjack (3/4ths cup with the remaining 1/4th being more shredded cheddar) and the hot sauce (about 2 teaspoons).  I recommend using the full amount of both.   It was delicious and a hit with the guys!!

Very tasty.  Used Monterey Jack instead of Pepper Jack ... still had a nice bite.  Used mix of 2% milk and non-fat evap.  I was concerend by the small amount of macaroni used...it worked out, but wonder what would happen if I used twice as much (without doubling the sauce...).

Yes, this is a gooder. 
I used all cheddar (two kinds I had on hand) and also used 2 cups of elbow macaroni instead of the rotelle pasta. Worked great. The baking really made the whole dish come together. It wasn't too spicy for my two year old.

I took this recipe and changed a few things and it turned out amazing! I used 2 tsp of dry mustard, doubled the hot sauce and used double cayenne instead of chili powder since I didn't have any. I also didn't have pepper jack so I used double the sharp cheese and parmesean. Then something my family uses for topping is ritz crackers crumbled instead of bread crumbs. It was pretty good for my first time!

I'm not sure why this got such amazing reviews. We love spicy food but the taste was just awful.  Not a good flavor at all... especially the breadcrumbs on top... just terrible.  We didn't end up eating it. :(

This was very good, but not spicy enough to set it apart from my regular macaroni and cheese, even though I also added cayenne pepper to the cheese mixture.  Next time I will add diced jalapenos to the mix.

I made this last night for a dinner with my friends, and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did change it a bit.  When I mixed everything together, it was very soupy, so I boiled about 3/4 to 1 cup more of pasta to add, and that was perfect!  I also left off the breadcrumbs, and I used 1.5 cups of pepper jack and 1 cup of cheddar.  Will make this one again!

Was a good recipe, but as noted needed a bit more sauce. I reserved a bit of the pasta water and used that. The topping was great with the chili powder!  I'll make it again.

Well Hyperpuppy, you sure made a few guys quite happy with this recipe! Honestly, other than adding my usual garlic and onion powders, I really didn't change much of anything. My only addition was to cover the top of the casserole with shredded cheese before the bread crumbs went on. Hey, you can't get enough cheese right! Thanks a bunch!

It was very good.  I wasn't a fan of the chili powder topping.  It tasted like I was eating spoonfuls of the spice.  A little too overboard.  The cheese sauce was kicked up enough.  If I make it again, I won't put that on there.

pretty good twist on an all time favorite comfort food! Thanks for the recipe, I followed it completely - except I used cavatappi instead of rotelle.

Great receipe. I did add in some (to your taste) onion flakes and 2 tblsp granulated garlic., as well as for extra kick 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes. It has an unbelievable cheese taste. Also it did not put bake it or add the bread crumbs or chili powder in. Thanks for posting.

This is really awesome  recipe.  I just made it and I ate close to half of the dish (I am sure this makes more than 2 servings...).  The only reason I didn't devour it all is because I want to have it again tomorrow, and I used up my ingredients already. I used about 2 to 2 1/4 cups of elbow macaroni.  As for the chili, I used sriracha very liberally (4-5 tsp), as well as adding some cayenne pepper (I like things spicy).  At the last second I found out my cheddar is unusable, so instead I used 12 oz pepper jack + 4 oz smoked gouda + 1/2 cup parmesan instead.  It was delicious!  I think I like the pepper jack + smoked gouda combo even more than the cheddar + pepper jack.  I figured since smoked gouda is a bit denser than the regular supermarket cheddar this gives to about the right amount.   I sprinkled some bread crumbs too though I thought they weren't necessary - the dish is rich enough as it is and baking will give a top layer a nice crunch anyways.   Definitely my favorite mac&cheese recipe so far.  The texture and creaminess is perfect.  This pretty much beats any of the other ones I've had, including at the restaurant (helped by top-quality smoked gouda).  Will definitely make this again, and will try out with different cheese combos.

This was delicious!  I used Dijon instead of dry mustard for more flavor.  Would be great with jalepenos and bacon for even more flavor.

It seems like the taste is good but I'm not sure if it's me or the cheese used but I made this twice and it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked and actually broke down a little.

This was delicious! My husband loved it! I didn't add the chili powder because I was afraid it would be too spicy, but I feel like it would be the perfect amount, next time I will not leave it out.

Great "kicked up" flavor.  I didn't care for the bread crumb mixture on top, next time I'll leave it off and just sprinkle with the chili powder.  Even my Kraft Mac&Chesse loving kids liked this - just don't call it Mac&Cheese, in our house this is called "yellow pasta".  Also, didn't have the wagon wheel pasta, used rigatoni instead - worked out great.

Please help i dont know what i'm doing wrong.  I melted 2tbs butter and whenever i add the 1/4 cup of flour it just turns into little balls of dough.  I tried increasing the amount of butter to 4tbs and it was a little better but the consistency was almost "grits" like.  What am I doing wrong??

I liked it, but my boyfriend isn't sold on it.  I did cut it in half and was less than precise in measuring.  We both thought it was dry, and I thought it had lots of peppery taste, but not enough cheese taste.  IF I make it again, I will make a full amount of cheese sauce for half the amount of pasta.  Plus I'll add more cheddar cheese. But I won't bother making it for my boyfriend!!

I can finally have mac'n cheese again! My husband said ordinary mac'n cheese was too blah, and wouldn't have it, but he loved this. It's great comfort food, and I share this with lots of people.

A big hit. I don't eat everything I cook (and mac and cheese is one of those things), but I have made this many times for picnics and small dinners, and it's always a hit. My daughter, away at college, actually called me to get this recipe... and that's a first! She's not much into cooking yet, but she and her roommates wanted to make mac/cheese, and she remembered this recipe! My compliments to the chef!

This was really, really good.  I made a double recipe for a church potluck and it was gone right away!  The only thing I did different was to use Havarti with Jalapenos instead of the pepper jack since I already had it in the house.  I don't think it made a big difference though

Good! Even my kids loved it. No rotelle, so I used elbow macaroni. No dry mustard so I used a tbsp. of dijon. I doubled the pepperjack and made my own breadcrumbs. I cut back on the hot sauce in the whole dish but I did add more to my own when I served it. Kicked up indeed. I like! NOTE: This thickened up A LOT while sitting which wasn't a big deal for me but if a thicker sauce isn't your bag, you might want to add just a little more milk to your sauce. It could be because I doubled the cheese, too.

WOW! I tripled this recipe for a potluck, used Panko instead of bread crumbs, deleted the hot pepper sauce and added Cayene Pepper to the crumbs instead.  I thought I made enough to enjoy leftovers for a while, but it was all gone. Many people commented this was the best Mac and Cheese they ever had.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe pretty much as it's written. I did use a whole box of pasta though. As some users mentioned, I think it could do without the breadcrumbs, because I really don't think it added much flavor wise. I did put some extra cheddar over the top. Delicious!

I made some variations based on what I had available. Here is my version:

Ingredients:
2 cups elbow pasta
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups skim milk (fresh from local farm)
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 - 1/2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper
1/4 cup shredded mild blue cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded white LIVAROT or something very similar to this. (ripped off the label and can't remember the name, but it is considered a stinky cheese and has a mild flavor. Or Havarti will work, but you'll have to cut it up because it's too soft to shred.)
1/2 cup grated 5 yr aged GRUYERE
1 medium clove chopped shallot
1/3 cup chopped onion
1-3 cloves garlic
1 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cook pasta until al dente; drain.
In a small saucepan melt 2 tablespoons butter, add in shallots, onions and garlic simmer until caramelized. Once caramelized stir in 1 tsp cayenne powder. 
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. A little at a time, whisk in milk, mustard, salt, pepper and hot sauce. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute, then remove from heat and whisk in shredded cheeses until smooth. Stir in cooked pasta and pour into shallow 2 quart baking dish.
Sprinkle shallot mixture over macaroni mixture.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This is the 3rd homemade mac and cheese recipe I have made and have not cared for.  The texture just throws me off.  I use quality cheese and grate it myself so I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.  Maybe I'm just not meant for it!  Guess I'm just gonna stick to the box!

It was a good change to the typical mac n' cheese. Like other reviewers, I found that the sauce could accomodate a full box of pasta. Tasted good warmed up the next day too.

This was my first attempt and triumph at making mac n cheese! Everyone loved it! I did cut back on the hot sauce; added 1 tsp instead of 3. I love spicy food so for next time I'll have to make a seperate batch with all 3 tsp!

I'm surprised how many people found this to be too spicy. It really isn't. I bet it would be great with some diced onion and tomato. I'll make it again.

My fiance and I both enjoyed this recipe very much, we also put the chili powder in the sauce mixture and found it better. A nice variation to a traditional classic!

Delicious!  I switched a few ingredients since I didn't have them on hand, but the end result was definitely a spicier version of mac and cheese and I loved it!  So much better than the bland versions and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this for dinner last night and boht my (some what picky) husband and I loved it!  The only thing that I changed was that I did not melt the butter to add to the bread crumbs at the end, I just sprinkled bread crumbs & chili powder on the top before baking.   Great recipes!  We will make again!  Hubby even thinks its better than the Twisted Mac N Cheese he orders at hard rock.

This was a great baked mac and cheese. I did increase pasta to 3 cups. The casserole was creamy with the promised kick.Not dry at all. Excellant!

LOVED this recipe. I did use regular pepper and whatever noodles I had on hand and instead of mixing the parmesan in the cheese sauce, i just mixed it with the breading for the top. We LOVED it! Best mac and cheese I have ever had!

This recipe was very good! I felt there was way too much cheese compared to the amount of pasta it called for so I ended up boiling more for a total between 2 and 2 1/4 cups. I didn't have parmesan so I ended up using romano instead. I also threw in some diced tomatoes which added a bit of extra flavor. Next time will also throw in some diced chilis. Overall, very good! Will definitely make again!

Used Whole Wheat flour (trying to get away from the bleached flours) and it originally turned out soupy.  Used Rotini pasta, because that was all I had.  Had to double the pasta, but other than that, really good.  Could use something for crunch, like peppers.  Will make again!

I was beginning to lose faith in this site until I stumbled upon this recipe. It was GREAT!  I did not have any problem with it being too dry as some people did, it was perfect, it even reheats well.  I added hamburger meat seasoned with onion, garlic, and chili powders and I really thought it added an extra kick.  I also upped the hot sauce and added a dash of cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce.  I recommend NOT omitting the chili powder/ bread crumb topping as it made a nice crunchy coating which really is the final touch to this wonderful dish.  Thanks so much, will definitely be making this time and time again!!

Really great mac and cheese in a more "adult" way. We really kicked up the spice, and it was a huge potluck hit.

I expected a whole lot more from this dish.  I used just over 2 c of medium size shell pasta, and there was still not enough pasta to go with the amount of sauce.  The sauce was spicy but it got clumpy rather quickly which bummed me out.  I left of the breadcrumbs (based on some other reviews) and I don't think it would have made a difference either way.  Perhaps if I freshly shredded all of my cheeses (I only shredded the pepperjack... the cheddar and parmesan were pre-shredded) I might not have had clumping issues?

This was OK.  I used 2 & 3/4 cups macaroni elbows.  (Definitely need to add more pasta than what is suggested.)  If I had to do it over, I would omit mixing the chili powder with the breadcrumbs...not because it is too spicy either.  Leftovers tasted good.

This recipe came out really nicely.  Next time I make it, I'll probably add a bit more to the spice (I'm a spicy foods kinda guy), and will probably leave out the bread crumbs.  Other than that, magnifique!

The first time I made this my roux looked like a ball of dough, rather than a smooth buttery paste. That's when I noticed the roux proportions were off: roux should be 1 part flour to 1 part butter. 1/4 cup of flour = 4 tbsp flour, so you should be using 4 tbsp butter. The ingredients do list 4 tbsp butter, but then the directions encourage, "melt 2 tablespoons butter, whisk in flour" and reserve the remaining two tbsp butter for the topping later on. Wrong!

So! My second go, I used 4 tbsp flour, 4 tbsp butter, on medium low to get the nice smooth paste. I substituted shredded Gruyere for the sharp cheddar (didn't have any on hand) and skipped the butter/breadcrumb/chili powder topping altogether. I also skipped the baking because I wanted a creamy, hot, stovetop version.

Thought the sauce ended up a bit bland (I like hot) and runny, so I mixed in about 1 tbsp of the chili powder I ignored earlier and a little Worcestershire, plus a bit more Sriracha. Let it sit over medium heat without stirring to thicken it up for a few minutes, then I dumped the creamy sauce all over my pot of cooked elbows and stirred.

OH GOD, now that was good. Minus a star for the roux.

This was fantastic with a tiny modifications.  Instead of using hot pepper sauce, I cooked two jalapenos with some ham and added it to the sauce just before adding the pasta.  Just delicious.  A must try!

This is absolutely a great recipe, creamy and very tasty.  The best I have ever made, I just made a couple of changes in the type of cheeses I used.  I used asiago cheese and a little swiss and the cheddar.

Wish I could give a 3 and a half, it was good and something different, just didn't knock my socks off.  It took a lot of time to make and it tasted the best right out of the oven.  Since there's only three of us, we had a ton left over, and unfortunately it didn't reheat really great.  The texture was a little grainy instead of smooth.  It was worth trying, but I'm going to keep looking for a favorite homemade mac n' cheese recipe... this one wasn't right for me.  I'm bummed because I was excited to try it!

Great! I left out the hot sauce, have kids, but did everything else pretty much the same. I used 16oz box of elbows, and it was perfect for the amount of sauce. I used cheddar and colby jack cheese, all I had, with the parmesan and didn't have any clumping problems. Tasty. Definitely make it again! Thanks!

I thought this was good.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly so my rating might be higher had I done so.  I used 2 cups of macaroni, 2 teaspoons of hot pepper sauce, and 1 teaspoon of chili powder.  I also only had regular jack cheese, but I added some diced jalapenos.  
I put the pasta in the casserole dish and poured the sauce over it.  I reserved about 3/4 of a cup of sauce because the 2 qt. casserole dish was very full.  When I reheat the leftovers I will use the leftover sauce.

This was a really good alternative to the regular mac and cheese recipes. I did as other reviews suggested and added more noodles (about 3 cups) and followed the recipe as stated. I did omitt the bread crumbs. I did follow another reviewers suggestion and added a pound of ground beef cooked with onion, garlic, and seasoning salt. Combined the beef, macaroni, and cheese sauce in a casserole dish, sprinkled the rest of the pepper jack cheese on top and baked for about 20 min.  This took me about the same about of time to cook some hambuger helper, and it was much tastier. I will be adding this onto my quick weekdays meal list.

Next time I will use about 1/2 box of pasta, and maybe only 1/2 cup of pepper jack + 1/2 cup of monterey jack.  very easy, will definitely do again.

Love this! I've made it many times and have found that whichever type/brand of hot sauce you use will really change the final taste. It's been fun to experiment with.

It was really good!! I added some chopped jalepenos and it was superb....spicy but subtle.  Also i felt there was too much cheese to mac ratio, so i added another 1/2 cup of macaroni.
Delish!

It was delicious!  I made  some substitutions and added some ingredients though:

I used Dijon mustard instead of dried mustard, and I chopped up 3 jalapeno peppers instead of the hot pepper sauce.

I added some shredded Swiss cheese and half a chopped onion to it. 

I added some cayenne pepper and mixed it and the chili pepper into the cheese mix.

I made this recipe for the first time today when some family came over for dinner. I used just under 8 cups of pasta and added more cheese which was great for serving seven adults. It's important to make sure you have the sauce pan at medium heat and maybe even on the higher side when starting to mix the butter and flour so that the following ingredients will thicken properly to create the cheese mixture. If you want to add some extra kick to the bread crumbs try adding 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper before sprinkling them over the dish prior to baking. Also, I like my mac and cheese a little more well done so I let it cook for around 40 minutes and it came out golden brown. Overall, it was an enjoyable dish that didn't take much effort and the family loved it!

This...is...amazing! Like other reviewers, I used more pasta (about 3/4 box, but there was enough sauce that an entire box prob. Would have worked, too). I followed the recipe exactly except that I fried up some bacon with minced garlic to mix in to the topping. I should have made more topping since I had more pasta, but that is the only thing I'd do different next time

Served with smoked ribs, and later combined for a leftover dish this was a hit. The amount of pasta is definitely understated, just use a standard box. I added extra hot sauce and a little extra chilli powder so I could put some in the breadcrumbs and the sauce. Even our spice-intolerant-friend enjoyed this so if you want it extra spicy try a habanero jack or more hot sauce. I also completely forgot the Parmesan cheese so I sprinkled it on top with the breadcrumbs which worked out great.

OK I’ve  this a few times now.  Every time I make it comes out very bland and I do follow the recipe. Today I had a little bit more time and decided to do what I wanted with it. I am making this for my sons school teacher luncheon. First thing first I went to the store yesterday and did not want to go again today so I actually had my groceries delivered . She ended up getting me the rotelle pinwheel pasta so just a heads up ha! It’s going to sound like that I do not like this recipe, but I really do Like it for a good start to a cheese sauce. As I stated earlier in this review, I feel like this sauce is very bland. Since I am making it for more people, I tripled the recipe and followed it exactly. Except the whole milk. I only had 8 cups. Worked out fine. Also put chili powder in with cheese sauce.  Then I added a lot of extra ingredients. I added more salt than suggested.   I added much more hot sauce than called for (Franks red hot). I then added about a half a bottle of buffalo wild wings mild sauce  and about a 1/4 cup Taco Bell hot sauce(had both on hand). I added 2 1/2 packages of  velveeta cheese sauce.  Ranch dressing came next(1/4-1/2 cup) i also put in hiddenvally ranch powder(just sprinkled it all over top) I put in onion powder(generous amount) , celery salt(a bit). I know this probably sounds like a salt bomb, But if you’re making this you’re probably not that health-conscious ha! The times that I have made this it has always come out a bit gritty. I

This turned out really well for a change of flavor. I was in the mood for a different taste although I won't say it's my new favorite M&C.  Next time I won't be in such a hurry and I'll grate my own cheese from a block, it will have a silkier texture.  I use farm fresh whole milk so why use shredded from a package?    I also didn't feel that there was enough pasta in ratio to the sauce and next time I will leave out the chili powder from the bread crumbs.

10.08.16 ~ We sure did enjoy this mac and cheese dish! There was a nice kick to the cheese sauce that led to dish packed with flavor. I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1%, and it worked great. We had this along side 'Meatball Sandwich' from AR and we had a very comforting meal. The leftovers of this dish warmed up nicely without it getting too thick. I gave my dad a dish (too spicy for mom) and he enjoyed it also. Definitely would make this one again. A great recipe to share HYPERPUPPY, thanks!

This was a big hit with both of my gourmet teenage boys.  We used Italian bread crumbs, Parmesan, chili pwdr & paprika for the crust (no melting) just sprinkled it all on there.  It made a tasty, crunchy top.  
I added horseradish to the mix. And, I sautéed an onion and clove of garlic (minced) before adding thickener.

I doubled the recipe figuring it would fill a 12.5 x 9 x 1.75 throw-away aluminum baking pan. The finished product fit exactly. The bread crumb crumbles on top I could have done a better job on, but that's my fault. I should have chopped the mixture into small crumbles separately before trying to spoon them on top. Too chunky, I had to go crush the hunks with my fingers and re-spread them. Was it a success? I tabled it at a Thanksgiving party of 30 people and it was gone in a half hour while many of the other side dish offerings went cold. I'll make this again next year.

I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Only baked for 10 minutes not wanting it to dry out. I used shell  pasta and added a can of diced green chiles, other than that made exactly as stated. Yummy! Will definitely make again!

IMy family really enjoyed this dish! Changes: added 1 pkg frozen baby broccoli florets, reduced hot sauce to 1 tsp, added @ 1 tsp nutmeg to sauce mixture, added 1-2 tsp garlic powder (powder, not salt), omitted extra salt, used herb-seasoned stuffing mix for topping (instead of bread crumbs). Everyone had seconds -- and that's a first!

really tasty. I accidentally put the chili powder in the sauce, bit it came out delicious anyway. my bf and I prefer a bit more heat, so I sprinkled cayenne and black pepper over the top before adding the breadcrumbs, and also mixed in some lump crab meat with the pasta and cheese sauce. it was amazing! thank you for this yummy recipe.

Everything you want mac and cheese to be!  I used skim milk, and it worked out just fine.  Nice and creamy.

Loved this! Very creamy and has a great kick to it, and didn't last very long! :) 
I used 2% milk instead of whole for a few less calories and dairy, and we are about half of it on top of some toasted bread w garlic.
Will definitely make this again

I'm new to cooking so I decided to give this a go,  minus not being prepped and ready with ingredients I managed to make a stellar meal. It was fantastic! My partner says it was probably hands down one of the best homemade Mac and cheese recipes he's ever had!

As promised in the other reviews, this was really interesting and delicious. I made it as a side dish with barbeque burgers. I forgot to add the parmesan. I used shells and rigatoni and had some leftover green chilies in the frig so I threw those into the cheese sauce. I also doubled the crumbs. Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

My sister's wedding was going to be in New Orleans. So, for her wedding shower, we decided to go with a Creole theme and this was one of the dishes I made. Was FABULOUS!!! Everyone thought so, even my Grandmother, who can be very picky! MAKE THIS DISH! And yes, increase the pasta to 2 1/2 cups as it is definitely a typo.

This is my go-to mac & cheese recipe.  I add way more pasta to the mix (at least a full box, if not a box and then some).  And I also do it all in one pot: boil pasta, make cheese mixture, mix cheese and pasta.  I've also adapted the recipe by using standard cheeses and adding meats.

This was actually my first time ever making Mac and cheese, and it turned out amazing! The only minor change I made was that I used crumbled Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and used a bit more cheese. I served it with buffalo chicken fingers, and it was a big hit with the hubby!

Excellent mac and cheese! Made recipe as written except added more pasta ( about 1 lb.). Had a nice kick to it. Reheats well, will defiantly make again!

A great creamy mac and cheese with a nice kick to it.  It might need some more noodles though.

I can finally end my search for the perfect mac and cheese recipe.  This is fantastic, especially with panko bread crumbs on top.  Yummers.

I LOVE this recipe! I tried it for the first time a few nights ago - as per the suggestions, I used about two and a half cups of uncooked pasta. I also realized last-minute I was out of hot sauce, so I added (dumped, whoops) some chili powder and cayenne powder into the cheese mix, so I forwent the chili powder in the crunchies on top. It did turn out a tad dry (which was a little more noticable when re-heating leftovers), but I think that was partially due to it having to linger in my oven on low for quite a while (I was taking it to a family member's house and we weren't exactly sure about the time). Overall, I'd add a little more milk and I wouldn't bake it for quite as long. Also, next time I'm using sriracha sauce - I put some on leftovers and it was AWESOME.

I had to make this gluten free because I am allergic to wheat, so I used rice macaroni, and potato flour for the rue.  So the texture of the macaroni is not a creamy as it would have been using wheat products. I used cayenne instead of pepper sauce so it would not have the vinegar.  The taste was scrumptious so I still gave it 5 stars in spite of the texture. Yum

This recipe is awesome! I used about a cup of heavy cream and the rest was 2% since that is all I had on hand. It still turned out great!
