Made as stated, but accidentally put in twice the amount of vanilla extract, which probably detracted from the tartness.  I found them, 'ok', but the  other people who had them, raved about them.  I'd make again, as they were easy enough and good for a crowd.

I made as in the recipe but didn't add any nuts to the crust .I also added lemon zest and extract.. not very sweet I think 1 cup of sugar would be better to give it more sweetness .Also not a very thick bar so if you want a thicker bar use a 8x8 pan.

Made this but the original sugar amount with the cream cheese left this too tart for my crew. Did end up gradually adding sugar to total 1/2 cup. These are excellent. I can see further experimentation with different flavors and spice additions. Will definitely make this again!

It was pretty good, I actually used an Oreo crust that I got from the store instead of making my own. I think it gave it more sweetness which made it extra good!

I made this for a dessert after a voice recital event.  Most everyone liked it and commented on it.  I was not impressed.  The recipe did not say when to add the lemon juice, and the flavor of lemon was practically nonexistent.  The base did not brown up as they said it should, even though I added more butter than proposed in the recipe.  The cheese layer was thin, and probably required twice as much as indicated.  It was easy enough to make and bake, but I might try to tweek it the next time I try it.

This is really good! Many of the other reviews spoke about the tartness if the dessert. I did not have a lemon on hand but rather a lime. I only used 1 tbs of lime juice and it really brought out the flavors. I couldn’t imagine using 2tbs. I believe the amount of lemon juice called for is too much. Other than that adjustment, soo good!

Left out lemon juice because I didn’t have any. Used pecans instead of walnuts in the base. Decided to use maple flavouring instead of vanilla. These were delicious and everyone loved them!  Will make again.

This is one of my all time favorites!  I use various toppings - try lemon curd or custard for a Spring treat!  Cherry or strawberry filling on top for holiday festive look and taste.  And, if you feel naughty and daring, caramel, toasted pecans and chocolate drizzle - have mercy!!!

As suggested in one of the reviews I used 1 cup of sugar and baked it in an 8x8 pan baking it longer until done.  I omitted the nuts since my son cannot eat them. This a keeper!
