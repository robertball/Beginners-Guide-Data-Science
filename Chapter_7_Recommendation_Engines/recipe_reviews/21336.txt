Makes good waffles. I added some vanilla for more flavor. I like the make-ahead feature a lot - saves time in the morning when you need to put breakfast on the table in a hurry.

These are fabulous waffles and so quick & easy to make. I altered the recipe a bit by using only 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 t. of vanilla extract, 1/2 t. of cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and sprinkled pecans of the batter after pouring it into the iron. My husband raved over these waffles! By the way, left over batter rises beautifully in the fridge, making the next day's batch of waffles even fluffier.

THE best waffles we've ever had. EVER. I only made one change and that's using whole wheat white flour. I kept everything else the same (only using organic where I could). I laugh at the eight servings because my boys ate every single waffle I made. I made Absolute Best Pancake Syrup special to go with these waffles and it really just.....wow. Really off-the-charts yummy.

These are really great waffles.  They are so light and fluffy, and crisp on the outside.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and you couldn't even tell any whole wheat was in there.  My kids just loved these and kept asking for more- even my one-year old (who just ate his plain).  I chose this recipe because it used buttermilk and didn't involve whipping the egg whites separately.  I also liked the fact that it used yeast.  I have some batter leftover so I'll have to see how that is tomorrow.

Finally, a waffle that is light, fluffy, and flavorful! These were excellent...we added a little vanilla, and maybe a tsp of flour to thicken it up, but otherwise it was perfect. Just like a restaurant!

These came out very eggy for me and soft.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, or if they're supposed to be like this but I got no crunch at all.  The batter seemed like the right texture but the waffles definitely weren't.  I will give these a second shot in the morning after the batter sits overnight but I don't have high hopes unfortunately.  They tasted fine, but the texture just wasn't very waffle-like; more like pancakes.

Great recipe. Had to cook as pancakes since I don't have a waffle iron any more. I made these for my dad who loves waffles and never met a pancake he didn't like. He amazed me when he said that they weren't like pancakes OR waffles but were BETTER THAN BOTH! Can't wait to make them for the rest of the family.

I was nervous as I have never made waffles any way other than from a mix before, but these are really easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only issue I had was my first batch ran over horribly.  I may simply have a small waffle iron, once I decreased the batter to 1/4 cup they were perfect.  
I froze the leftovers and my daughter has eaten them for breakfast every morning this week.

After reading all the reviews was looking forward to these waffles. A bit disappointing, 1/4 cup of mix wouldn't cover the bottom of my waffle iron, I have a larger belgium waffle maker, maybe others are using smaller iron. I got 4 full size waffles and about 1/2 of another.  The batter was a bit runny but did cook up fine, but was not crunchy on the outside but soft and we were not fussy on these. I did freeze the ones we didn't eat as my grand daughters will eat them, but personally will stick with my old recipe. I followed recipe and only changed oil for apple sauce, everything else remained the same. I'm glad others found these so nice but I will not be using this recipe again

These were just what I have been looking for.  They taste like the waffles I remember as a kid.  I make "hot" breakfast at least 5 days a week, so I have been through a TON of waffle recipes.  This is my new "go-to"!!!

This is a pretty good little waffle recipe.  I was happy with the consistency and taste and only made a couple modifications. I added 2T. of sugar and a 1t. vanilla. Our family likes a little sweeter waffle. Preparation was fairly simple. I would recommend and share this recipe.

This was easy & GREAT.  The waffles were crisp outside, soft inside, great flavor.  I doubled this recipe (5 teen boys + adults) and for some reason it was way too thin.  I added a cup and a half of flour.  It was still thinner than I am used to but worked perfectly--raised to fill the waffle iron.  This is my permanent waffle recipe.

These are fantastic, but I always have to tweak my recipes.....so I changed out 1/2 cup of the flour to whole wheat, used 1/4c brown sugar for the white, 1/4tea of nutmeg and added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon like everyone else.  To add some omega 3 acids I also added 1/4c of flax seed.  
If you leave the leftovers out to cool for an hour they freeze wonderfully and you don't have to buy those expensive ones.  My kids love them and my husband said they taste like restaurant waffles.

These waffles were pretty good but I think I'll stick with my regular waffle recipe. The good thing about this recipe is that you can make the batter the night before.

This recipe is easy to make, with readily available ingredients, but here's the best part:  It makes wonderful pancakes!  I found this out purely by chance when my waffle iron gave out.  The pancakes were light and very tasty.

This is definitely the quickest yeast-based waffle recipe I have tried.  Of course, the yeast seems to be present mostly for flavor, as the recipe includes both baking powder and soda.  I was terribly disappointed in the results; the waffles were tough and tasted extremely yeasty.  Adding twice as much oil or butter and extra sugar seemed to help a little, but these waffles tasted nothing at all like the traditional yeast-leavened variety.

Thank you for sharing this tasty waffle recipe! I lost my favorite recipe last year and this is very close. I added a little vanilla and cinnamon because that's how my family likes them. Next time I will mix it the night before. Next time will be very soon! Thanks again!

I loved these waffles!

I used one teaspoon of INSTANT YEAST because I was out of active dry yeast and followed the directions for instant yeast by adding them directly to the flour. (No need to proof the yeast)

Made them the night before and let them rise on the refrigerator overnight. Took them out thirty minutes before cooking them to bring to room temperature.  

Absolutely delicious!

I followed this recipe the way it was written and they were delicious. The batter is on the thin side, which is why I think they are so crispy. We prefer lighter and crispy waffles, rather than thick. Very good. Probably won't use Bisquick again unless there is a big time crunch.

These waffles are delicious!  They're light and fluffy on the inside, and crispy on the outside.  They also have a great yeast flavor.  These are by far my kids' favorites.

Very good, crispy waffles.  I used freshly ground soft wheat flour and sucanat to sweeten.  The waffles came out light and fluffy.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

I made a couple of changes to really enhance the waffles, and they were really good. I used 1 3/4 c buttermilk, 1/4 heavy cream, 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla, 1/2c of flour and 1 1/2 tbsp sugar.  Though I used it, I somewhat leary about using yeast in this way.

Wow!!! This were delicious!!!  I made these into pancakes, not waffles.  Chocolate chip pancakes to be precise.  I also added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, just a personal preference.  This is now our favorite recipie for pancakes.  Quick and easy, and the batter stores well too for quick morning breakfasts(or lunch or dinners!)

Pretty good waffle recipe.  It could also be used for pancakes.  It didn't come out as thick as I would have liked them, but they were very nice and fluffy.

A good waffle. It is more like a true Belgian waffle since it uses yeast. Although rising light and fluffy, the yeast gives these a sturdier bread texture. I used an old-fashioned deep pocketed Nordic Ware Belgian waffler that I flip on a gas stove by hand. One level cup of batter fills these fully and it made 4 four-sectioned waffles. I made the mistake of using a heaping cup on the first (thinking that the 1/4 cup was a misprint for 1 1/4 cups) and the waffler opened 3/4 of an inch and batter overflowed. I have made hundreds of waffles over the past 45 years; I deem this worthy of putting into my file for a future repeat, especially due to the make ahead batter aspect.

A ittle too eggy for my tastes but made a nice, crispy waffle, but only after letting the batter sit overnight.

The recipe makes exactly 8 pan-sized waffles (heart ones) for those wondering. The mix is indeed runnier than your average waffle mix, but they work; use a regular-sized ladle and pour about 4/5 of it and it will not spill. Leaving them overnight makes them fluffier as it has been mentioned. I prepared a batch of the batter last night, using whole wheat and indeed, you couldn't tell they were whole wheat. Since I always make whole wheat & oat pancakes I wanted to test if it would work with these.. in the last 2 waffles i added a handful of oats and stirred. They made the batter a little thicker but also tasted great. So if you worry about your batter being runny, add oats and wait 5 minutes before starting, so the oats soak up some liquid. Wonderful, wonderful waffles, thank you :)

I've tried this with trytamil flour and got better results than with plain flour! I make the batter the night before and leave it covered in a wide deep bowl (for expansion ) unrefigerated.

This recipe was easy but extremely tasteless, and I won't use this again. I also had so many problems getting them out of the waffle maker that they came out in pieces. I never had a problem with other waffle recipes I've used.

I added some vanilla, and sprinkled chopped toasted pecans on top of the batter before cooking.  Served with real maple syrup simmered with butter & cream and a dash of cinnamon.  Yum!

My son asked for "the pancakes with squares on them", and when I realized he was talking about waffles, I found this recipe right away - I didn't want to have to beat egg whites, and this is a great way to avoid that. The ONLY thing I switched was adding vanilla, but also about 3 Tbsp malt powder. My kids gobbled it up - solid, perfect recipe as is!

These waffles were really good. I made a few tweaks based on how we normally make waffles and other reviews. I added a tsp of vanilla, about a tsp of cinnamon, and then while meaning to add a dash of nutmeg, I managed to dump a whole lot more in.. so, after trying to scoop out some of the excess nutmeg, and while I admitedly had more than a dash, I went ahead and made up a portion of the batter. The extra nutmeg was awesome! It added some really nice spice and some good flavor, a fortunate accident. My 2 year old devoured these, and she is not the best of eaters. I saved about 2/3 of the batter in the fridge to make for the next day, and they were so light and fluffy. Normally I make extra to save for her breakfasts during the week, so I am going to see if I can recreate my happy accident again, try with about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and make these up again to freeze for the week. Great receipe, a keeper!

The Waffles were EXCELLENT! The only different thing that I had done was instead of using regular buttermilk I had used powdered buttermilk and added some water to get it to the right consistency.
They were very light, airy and fluffy as we like them!!

YUM!  These are among the very best waffles I've ever had, and so easy to make!  I am making these to freeze for my son's breakfasts.  He had to have the first one off the iron to taste test of course, and as soon as he tasted it he asked me to make a 2nd batch.  He really likes the "eggy" flavor, and says it makes it seem like a full meal instead of just a waffle.  (lol)   I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe! Made as written except 1/4 cup of batter wasn’t enough for my waffle iron. A full 1/3 cup of batter worked better. Didn’t mix the night before but will try that next time. My family loved the waffles. Made a full recipe and got 11 complete waffles.

I tried a blogger’s yeast waffle recipe and it was very good, but I wanted to find the perfect yeast waffle. I think I have with Mamaw’s. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and let the batter sit out all night under some stretch-tire. It was the best waffle ever! Excellent recipe!

Turned out amazing. I didn’t have any buttermilk, so curdled some milk with about a tablespoon of vinegar. Made about 7 of these pokeball waffles.

I've made these waffles for the last 5 Sundays.  Yummy!!. I make my batter the night before, put it in the fridge and pull it out when I get breakfast started.  Super fluffy, and if you play around a bit with your waffle iron timer, you can ensure they are crispy on the outside.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure the waffles would be good frozen and warmed in the toaster.  I did try freezing my left over batter and pulling it out the following week, it was good and still  airy but not as good as a fresh batch.

This recipe was great! However a bit bland, I added A half cup of sugar and 1 tbs of vanilla extract to give it a little more umf.

I really liked these waffles. The flavor is great and they are light and fluffy. I followed the recipe and made no changes. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because they are not crispy. They come out of the Waffle Iron with a soft texture.

easy and very tasty! They were crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. I added vanilla, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

I made these a couple of  nights ago and they were good.  Because I don't have buttermilk I used Kefir, it's also a fermented milk, and I use 2 extra large eggs instead of three eggs. It made 8 regular round waffles.  Oh, and I added fresh blueberries.    I will use this recipe again, it was quick and easy.

So good and so easy!  Light and crisp, exactly what I look for in a waffle.  I did add a little vanilla,  made them 5he night before and refrigerated the batter.  Will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Pretty good waffles.   They have good flavor but weren't as crispy as I would have liked.   I will definitely make it again.

Great waffles! Made small change. For 5 servings instead of 1/2 teaspoon baking soda I put 1/4 and it worked out great. I'll definitely make it again! Had them for breakfast. Very tasty with maple syrup.

Made this recipe for the first time this morning ... my first time ever making waffles from scratch! I didn't have any buttermilk, so I substituted Greek yogurt for a 1/4 portion of it and skim milk for the other 3/4. The kids thought they were fantastic!

I have made these several times.  The first I followed the recipe as written and also felt it had a very eggy flavor.  Subsequent batches I used 2 eggs and like the flavor much better.  I also add vanilla to the batter.  I have used regular yeast and bread machine yeast and both have worked great.  I also use a full fat buttermilk so I reduced the amount of oil in the recipe.

These were ok. They turned out spongy for us. Everyone ate them but we've had better.

Our family is partial to yeasty tasting goods and this recipe provided a light-yeast taste. I added an additional tablespoon of sugar but made no other ingredient changes. TIP: After blending all ingredients, let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to allow the yeast to develop. Like another reviewer said, the yeast saved the step of beating eye whites to get a lighter waffle. We loved the recipe.

If you like light, airy waffles then I think this would be a great waffle recipe for you.  I prefer my waffles a bit heavier or denser than this, so I'm only giving it 4 stars.  I'll keep looking for a recipe that suits my tastes.

Love that the batter can be saved in the refrigerator for my boys to make their own breakfast in the a.m.  I followed recipe exactly the 1st time and my family liked them.  I have since just used milk instead of buttermilk because I rarely have it on hand.

The waffles didn't crisp up - unless I waited until they were very very dark.  I'll stick to my egg white recipe, it takes longer to make but, unfortunately, you can see and taste the shortcut in this recipe.  They were too eggy - tasted more like french toast than waffles.
