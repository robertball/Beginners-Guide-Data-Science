I made these with some leftover Italian sausage and ground beef mixture I had from a lasangne. I used melted Veleveeta and left out the oregano. They were good but needed the oregano to give it a little more zip than just the meat and cheese. The cocktail rye is perfect to add a slightly sweet contrast of flavor, this gives it a little elegance and avoids the similarity to the miniature pizza type appetizer.

These were really good and different.  I made them for a super bowl party and they were a hit.  They do need to be served while warm, because they get chewy and not too appetizing as they cool down.  I would make these again.

I halved the recipe and other than added a dash of garlic powder - I didn't change a thing BUT no one in my house liked these. I'm giving this a 2-star b/c they were still ediable. The oregano was too overpowering and everyone thought these tasted "weird."  I really wanted to be the minority in my family and like these - but sadly, I had to agree w/ them. Sorry- wouldn't make these again.

So good.  My boyfriend loves these and would eat them every night if I would make them.  Easy to freeze before parties.  I use velveeta instead of jar cheese, add garlic and some Worshtishire (SP) sauce (about 1 tbs).

I have used this recipe many many times. Always a hit. I prefer using Mini Fillo Shells instead of the bread. More trouble for me but easier for my guests.Thanks.

Remember making these years ago.  These can be frozen before baking.  I put the unbaked 'bites' on a lined cookied sheet, place them in the freezer until frozen, then put them in freezer zip-lock bags for later use.  Better than ordering out pizza when your kids bring hungry friends home.  Preheat oven 425 degrees.

Delicious and the perfect party food! I make something similar to this, so I was pretty sure we would like them. I did reduce the oregano per our personal preference and added a bit of garlic powder. The family really enjoyed these, so that makes them a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)
