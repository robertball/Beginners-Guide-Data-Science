I did not include the anchovies -- not a flavor we enjoy. However, the meal was very bland and dry (perhaps because I didn't use the anchovies?). My husband thought this was ok (why I gave it 2 stars) but I did not like it.

I liked this dish, but my husband doesn't really care for sun-dried tomatoes, so he asked me not to make it again.
