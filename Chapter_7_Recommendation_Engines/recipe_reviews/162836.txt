If anyone is having toruble with the top chocolate layer here's a tip:  My recipe does not microwave the chocolate (it got edited by the higher ups)  Melt ingredients over low heat on the stove.  Turn off heat and add vanilla. Then with a wooden spoon beat it for about 2 minutes until it starts to shine.  This also helps to cool it a little.  Then spread over green layer and chill.  Hope that helps!!

OMG! If I could give these more than 5* I would. So chocolatey, and minty...what's not to love?! These are very rich and creamy and sooo delicious! The one thing I did do is put each layer in the freezer for just a few minutes before putting in the fridge for 30 minutes. I think that this helped keep the layers defined from each other. If you haven't tried these...YOU NEED TO! This will definately become a regular in our house! Thanks Cher for sharing such a great recipe!!!

I made a change to the chocolate frosting that went on top. I melted 2 ounces of semi sweet chocolate, 1/3 cup butter and 4 TBL of light whipping cream in a double broiler. Once melted I took off  heat and added about 3/4 cup powdered sugar. I then put the bowl with the mixture in it in a bowl of ice and whipped it. The end product is a fluffy fudge frosting. It was a massive hit. They were gone within 2 minutes! It sounds complicated for the frosting but well worth it and reall not that hard.

CRAZY, MAD GOOD !  I usually don't rate recipes...however this dessert warrants rating... AWESOME !  Yes, I'm a guy...that cooks...and has done the Fire Station competitive cooking gigs with my fellow firefighters for over 25 years...and THIS DESSERT IS CRAZY, MAD GOOD...and when I prepared this browie for friends and loved ones, after a cautious sampling these super rich and multi-flavored brownies are GONE!

To tell you the truth...I truly do not understand why various reviewers are having issues with preparing this dessert.  I followed the instructions that Cher provided to the tee...as I always do with recipes I find just find to have a starting point from which to make my own changes later on... and I had zero issues; and it comes out great each time.

There are a couple of suggestions that I will make for your consideration: The middle mint layer...I prefer a thicker layer as the instructions will only make for a thin layer...I make about 20% more.  Then the top layer...My first attempt to melt the butter with the chocolate as directed resulted in scorched butter as it melts far faster than the chocolate melted...put the butter in when the chocolate is 1/2 melted.  Lastly, halve the vanilla in the top layer...unless you REALLY like how it makes the layer taste.  I found 1 Tbs of vanilla very over powering... 

Change the flavoring extract and food coloring to make this WOW dessert work for any occasion...even a Fire Station Dessert Cook Off... lol...  Enjoy...

Oh my goodness these are rich and delicious.  Had the in-laws over and everyone loved them.  Did not have unsweetened chocolate so used 6 tablespoons of cocoa and 2 tablespoons of oil for two of the squares, and two squares of semi-sweet chocolate.  I also only used approx. 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla in the final layer as I thought 1 tablespoon was a lot.  Can't wait to try these with different flavor extracts.

I followed the recipe exactly and used the correct ingredients. The middle layer came out gritted, the top layer was runny and the brownie on the bottom was still mushy after 40 minutes in the oven at 350. The taste was okay but I will have to make changes if I make this again.

These have got to be the richest, the most decadent brownies I ever tried...I couldn't cook these in a 9 x 13 pan. I'm in an RV and that size of pan will not fit in my oven, so I baked in a 9 x 9 pan instead...I think I'll wait to make these again when I have a regular sized oven because they were so thick and chocolatey and rich...I should have cut them into 1-inch squares rather than regular brownie size pieces. I imagine I wouldn't need a quart of milk if they were a little thinner..I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is incredibly sweet..I only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar in the green frosting and I really think that was too sweet, I couldn't imagine using the full 4 cups (by-the-way, I burned my hand mixer up making this recipe...LOL!). I think the next time I make these, I would probably cut the confectioner's sugar down even more! These are super delicious...time consuming, but totally worth the effort...thanks for a great recipe!

These were great! Only had semisweet baking squares They were fine with those. Lessened the sugar by a quarter of a cuo because of teh semi sweet chocolate. Wish I had the regular chocolate. Will have to try again soon!

Made these today.  They were very good.  Made as written except for the topping.  I made a chocolate ganache using a cup and a half of milk choc chips and 2/3 cup of heavy cream.  My son said they tasted like Heaven.  I would recommend cutting them very small, they are quite rich.  Also I thought the mint layer was perfect.

I was unaware that allrecipes.com would change your review after you had written something. As I had originally said before allrecipes changed my review. These brownies are a complete waste of time the brownies have absolutely no taste at all and they wouldn't even cook right. The frosting recipe makes enough to coat the brownies with about 4 inches of frosting and it's sickeningly sweet. :( I'm absolutely furious that i wasted so much ingredients and overall around 3 sticks of butter. Just a little word to everyone. DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE!

These brownies are fantastic! I used 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of unsweetened chocolate. Because of this I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups. Amazing and I will be making them again and again.

These are SO VERY awesome!  For the topping I tried something different-- I took 1/4 c. butter, 1/4c. water and 4 squares sweetened bakers chocolate and melted in microwave. Only do about 15-20 seconds at a time to be sure don't cook the mixture.Then add about 1- 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let cool at room temperature before topping the green layer.  I used this as the topping and loved it.  I did as someone else suggested between each layer and that is to put in the freezer for a bit so each next layer spreads easier. Cut into small brownies. THey are rich but WONDERFUL!  Don't over cook the bottom layer.

I made these for our St Pattys day potluck.. They are very rich and having said that everyone loved them. I do use 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla instead of the tablespoon. All my layers came out just fine. I did put the brownie layer in the freezer before I frosted it . And did it again before I poured the chocolate on top..

I did cheat and used a Duncan Hines Fudge Browning Mix. This was really, really good. The peppermint flavor was right on and it was a perfect balance with the chocolate for us. Will make it every year for St. Patrick's Day. Thanks for sharing!

These turned out great!  They were a little sweet but I figured they would be just by reading the ingredients.  A big hit with the kids!  I had to use more food coloring to get the right green.  I also used less peppermint extract because I read that the full amount was a little overwhelming.

This was very good and the perfect festive color for St. Patrick's day! I thought it was a bit too sweet but my guests plates were practically licked clean so it must have been great! For the chocolate layer on top, I skipped the vanilla and butter because I didn't want the chocolate to sieze, and scooped the melted chocolate into a ziplock bag and squeezed it over the top before spreading it. It made it much easier to cover it evenly. However, because I didn't add the butter, the chocolate layer cooled too hard which made it difficult to slice through with a fork so next time I will just drizzle the chocolate on and not smear it. Thanks for such a great recipe - this will be my new standard for St. Pattys day!
P.S.substitution: 3 T cocoa + 1T melted shortening or oil = 1 square of unsweeted chocolate

Made today for St. Patty's these are awesome! And so fun to make! Yes I cut corners and used a box mix brownie. I let brownies cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes then put in the fridge to cool for another 30. I also let the middle and top layers cool for 30 minutes each.

Very good flavor, but baked exactly as written, and seemed to be underdone & a little doughy. Also very, very sweet.

AWESOME brownies!  I've made this recipe literally dozens of times and this is without a doubt the top of my list for special treats.  I didn't take time to make the brownie part and used a boxed mix instead and they still turned out amazing.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These are really good. But the peppermint is a bit over powerful. It's so rich. My co workers did like it, but I saw some leftover green middle on some plates.

Oh my this recipe is additive.  The pan I made was gone in a day with me eating the most.   The only minor change was I used Pure Mint & Peppermint Extract.  The centre layer reminded me of a Nanaimo Bar with both sweetness and texture.  We enjoyed the base on this recipe very much.  More cake like and not dense which was really a nice change.   Will be making a 1/2 batch right now as DH did not get any.

I really wanted to make these for saint patricks day buuut, I missed it :p so instead, for spring, I split the middle layer into four parts and made them blue, red, green, and yellow. Then for putting it over the bottom layer I put in (sorta) stripes and took a toothpick and dragged it every direction over the colors to make it tye dye looking. I did the rest of the recipe as it sayd and when I cut them it was amazing. Like rainbows, it was so cool! Also, I added a little more mint than the recipe called for, to taste, but I think this is an amazing recipe and its cool you could do red and green for Christmas or red white and blue for fourth of July!Its such a variable recipe that turns out delicious and fudge like on the bottom. Loved it!

Everyone at the party raved about these. I had no trouble making them and I'm no great cook. I cut them small, like two bite size, because they were very rich. Yum!

Oh wow, are these to die for. Very sweet, so don't need a big piece to be satisfied. I followed the recipe exactly. The key to the first two layer is the cooling. Make sure they are cold before adding the 2nd and 3rd layer. Didn't have any problems using microwave to melt the 3rd and final layer. Spread very well onto cold mint layer. YUM!!

I thought this was pretty good. The reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that I made a couple of small changes, and I think if I had made it as written, it would have been way too sweet. I made a half recipe, and used only 1 cup powdered sugar for the frosting. Also just used plain melted chocolate chips for the top layer.

Loved these brownies. They were very moist even 4 days later. I agree that they are quite rich and a 2x2 inch square is plenty! I used mint extract instead of peppermint. I do feel that it is not quite as strong and we loved the results. I will also try making the brownie in the future without the mint layer, just because it was yummy! It could become my new favorite brownie recipe. A keeper!

These are very good, very rich tasting brownie. I loved the mint layer, anything buttercream can't be bad. I used to make almost exact recipe except used a small can hershey's chocolate syrup, can't find the recipe though. I think those brownies turned out more cake like than these.

These were so good... different and good. My husband said they were like a piece of heaven lol. When I tasted the mint frosting before putting on the brownie it seemed VERY strong, but I went with it anyway, and after its all put together, it is the perfect combination.

This turned out fabulous. I did make a few changes. I froze & chopped up some Andie's Candies & put them over the top chocolate layer. Also I added an additional 1/3 c- of the Semi-sweet chips. With out it, I don't think it would have covered the brownies. 5 stars for sure !! Love it.

I've put off making this for months because DH doesn't like frosted brownies, well - he really liked this one.  I used real butter instead of margarine and I didn't have the whole amount of mint extract, only had 1 tsp and that was plenty.  So yummy, thanks Cher I can't wait to make these again.

These brownies were a huge disappointment. Technically speaking they came out ok - that is I didn't have issues with the consistency of the layers or anything like that - I just thought they tasted more like a light chocolate cake to me and the mint layer was sweet. I was hoping for a dense dark chocolate flavor for the brownie that could help balance the icky sweetness of the mint layer. I have a monster sweet tooth but overall these were just WAY too sweet for me to enjoy. It's all a matter of personal preference I suppose as others seemed to love them but they were not for me or anyone else in the house.

Too sweet!  No one at them at Christmas. I had to throw most of them away.  A cream cheese based green filling would be a good replacement for the confectionary sugar filling.

These are delicious!!! Only thing wrong is that by the end of the recipe you've ended up using about 4 sticks of butter (which my mom wasn't too crazy about either) so we cut them into small portions. Also, when you are applying the green peppermint paste to the brownies, make sure the brownies are COMPLETELY cool first. I started putting mine on early and the brownies started sticking to the paste so it started mixing in with the peppermint... once I realized this though I stopped and continued it later so it still worked out and they tasted GREAT!!!

We all really liked this recipe a lot! Instead of making the brownie recipe this way I made it the gluten free way.It is quite rich so I cut them to make 25 and it was the perfect amount because of the richness. Only thing is you must keep it either frozen or refrigerated because the top layer gets soft fast and the minty layer gets a bit messy... Hubby tried eating it with his fingers and was a mess! Lol!!

The biggest thing wrong with this recipe is the name. As a BROWNIE it only gets a 3...it is too sweet and dense. Now if the name was Luck O The Irish FUDGE then it is a 5....because that is much more the consistency. The minty filling: It is awfully strong on the mint if you just taste the filling alone but once it gets in with the chocolate layers then it is fine and not so overpowering.

Outstanding!!  I made these for the first time for a St. Patty's Day party. Looked great, tasted even better.  I did add extra peppermint extract and green food coloring, based on looks & taste when mixing together. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My friends took some home to their kids and got rave reviews.

I made this recipe AS IS, and the bottom did NOT turn out, it needed WAY more baking time!  The mint layer was WAY too strong, sweet and fluffy.  Since it was fluffy, the harder top layer squished the fluffy part out.  If I made it again, I'd use a brownie mix for the bottom and use way less confectioners sugar and mint extract.

These are very good, but very, very rich. Serving a piece as big as what is shown is not practical and they will not be finished. These can be cut into bite size portions and then are perfect, otherwise overkill.

Nice for St. Patrick's Day. A little time consuming but worth it. Brownie is very sweet. They are hard to cut without cracking the chocolate layer on the top.

Wow, what can I say, excellent!  Very good!  Made exactly as written with "correct" method for top layer - no changes needed.  This will be a new tradition for St. Patricks Day.  And, maybe Christmas, Easter, and every other holiday I can use as excuse to make these again.  Thanks!

I was not impressed with the brownie recipe for the bottom layer.  I too baked it for 40 minutes and found it to never be done.  It was not good and I would not make it again.

Okay. I still have some of these brownies left and it's been almost 2 weeks since I made them - and I gave away quite a bit. I like mint chocolate chip ice cream, maybe just not mint brownies. They were pretty, just not my thing.

These are definitely decadent.  I made these for St. Patrick's Day and they were well received.  I followed the instructions but will cut back on the mint extract by at least a 1/4 tsp. maybe a 1/2 tsp.  The chocolate topping is divine and cuts nicely even when cold.  It didn't crack and that made me happy.  I will make these again.

I tried to make these healthier by using splenda instead of regular sugar and they still came out good, but not the best I've ever had. After baking the brownie mixture, there was a layer of margarine bubbling on the top. My husband loves chocolate, but more of a plain chocolate dessert. I thought he would really love these because he likes mint chocolate chip icecream. But he's not going crazy over them.

Brownies were rich and delicious, but with added mint and chocolate topping they were too rich and sugary for half of my family's tastes.  I liked them, but you can only eat small squares at a time.

I brought these to an Irish party and made them as directed except that I melted the chocolate and butter together on the stove instead of using the microwave.  Everything came out perfectly and looked beautiful - until we ate them.  The kids liked them OK, but all of the adults thought they were way too sweet (6 cups of sugar)!  My teeth ached, and I couldn't wait to brush that aftertaste away.  I will not make these again.

Mmmm yummy. Very good. I lined my pan with tin foil so I could just lift the brownies out I also added 4 oz of cream cheese to the middle mixture because I wanted to cut the sweetness a little bit. Thanks!

OH MY! These were so much better than I ever thought they could be.  They are the right combination of chocolate and mint and chewy and gooey.  This is my new favorite brownie and will be going in my permanent recipe book.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used margarine instead of butter because I didn't have any.

Very good!  On the advice from another review, I only put 3/4 of the frosting on and it was still plenty sweet.  Next time I might just use one cup less powdered sugar in this layer.  Also, I only used half the amount of peppermint called for in the middle layer and I omitted the vanilla from the top layer. I was able to use the microwave successfully for the top layer. I put half of the butter in at the beginning and put the rest in at the end.

*Directions for the top chocolate layer:  Melt ingredients over low heat on the stove. Turn off heat & add vanilla. Then with a wooden spoon beat it for @2 minutes until it starts to shine. This also helps to cool it a little. Then spread over green layer & chill.  Also, the one thing to do is put each layer in the freezer for just a few minutes before putting in the fridge for 30 minutes. I think that this helped keep the layers defined from each other.  a change to the chocolate frosting that went on top. I melted 2 ounces of semi sweet chocolate, 1/3 cup butter and 1/4 cup of light whipping cream in a double broiler. Once melted I took off heat & added about 3/4 cup powdered sugar. I then put the bowl with the mixture in it in a bowl of ice & whipped it. Makes a fluffy fudge frosting.

These were such a hit at my feast, so glad I found this recipe, I've always wanted to try making a mint brownie. The five stars are for the brownie and mint layers, so chewy, brownie-chocolaty and the buttery mint layer rich and minty. But, I had to fool around with the top layer and made ingridvogel's Chocolate Ganache (minus Rum flavoring) instead of following the recipe. Cowabunga!! I lucked out and it was a good thing, the crowd roared (means they were very pleased). Thanks Cher and I know your top layer is very 5 stars if the other 2/3rds of this recipe is!

I used butter for the margarine in the brownies, 24 minutes was perfect for my oven. 
For the middle layer I only used 3 cups icing sugar because it was too dry as it was, I used 3 drops of Peppermint oil and some Kelly green paste colouring. 
For the ganache I used 1/4 cup butter melted in a small bowl for 15 seconds in the microwave, then added 1/2 cup chocolate chips microwaved for 15 seconds then another 1/2 cup chocolate chips microwaved for 15 seconds, stir vigorously until the chocolate melts completely and it thickens, work quickly to spread over the top of the filling. I omitted the vanilla as it is not needed and usually seizes the chocolate. 
Cut into 32 squares, enjoyed by my son's hockey team for their St. Patrick's Day treat.

This was a crowd pleaser!  To keep from packing away too many calories, we gave a lot away to neighbors and co-workers and all loved these brownies!

We served ours with a small scoop of Vanilla Bean ice cream and poured a little bit of Creme De Menthe liquor over the top of the ice cream.  That added a nice yummy touch!

The one thing that I will do differently next time would be to bake the brownies in a smaller (8 inch by 12 inch) baking dish, and cut the margerine used in the topping to 5 Tablespoons in stead of 6.

Good flavor combinations but far too sweet. The mint layer could be much thinner, or, as someone else suggested, make it into a cream cheese frosting.

These were eaten in minutes at our St. Patrick's Day themed snack table at church. I got many compliments. Super delicious! 
I followed the recipe to a T, the center of the brownie portion fell, but I let it cool overnight before adding the mint layer. Maybe more baking time was needed, but the fallen brownie was still so yummy- more fudge-like in texture (I may try a brownie mix next time.....but I don't know if this really can taste any better). Will make again!

I did not care for these, I followed the recipe and had to bake longer than what the recipe said. It's only saving grace was the mint frosting and chocolate topping.

These turned out great! Really rich though. The smaller the pieces, the better! These will go a long way. I added a bit more of color (for St. Patty's Day)with a spoon I drizzled some green icing over the top chocolate layer as it was cooling. They look great!

I love chocolate and sweets. I did find this recipe too sweet. It went in the garbage. My boys who have sweet tooth's didn't even eat it. Need a more cake like brownie. Less frosting. Maybe a thin layer of the chocolate topping.

Absolutely loved this brownie.  It brought back childhood memories!  It was a little time consuming, but well worth every minute:)  I followed the recipe exactly.  No changes are necessary at all!  I just need to find a less expensive way to buy peppermint extract:)

Delicious Cher!!!  Made recipe as directed and turned out perfect. My one recommendation for melting chocolate in the microwave, for this recipe or any other, is always microwave using 50% power and stirring at least every 30 seconds. I used Ghiradeli chocolate and was very yummy. I loved the different textures of the layers and the minty chocolate, super delicious. Definitely worth trying.

Delicious!! Really chocolatey and the mint was very nice.  I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 X 8 pan.  The kids loved them for St Patty's Day.
3/31/11 Update:  This is my favorite recipe right now.  I have been baking them with different toppings and so far each one has been incredible.  I love this brownie base and have topped them with vanilla cream, peanut butter cream and chocolate cream as well as the mint cream.  Just divine!

These things are DANGEROUS!  SO very good!  Made them for my 4 year old's preschool St Patty's party, sent in a bit more than necessary and I know there were a few missing - the teacher who hasn't in the past eaten my stuff complimented me on these!!  Made them just yesterday and they were gone by today - ALL 36 of them!  If there were more than 5 stars, this would qualify!  Followed it all the way through (even with the original chef's notation to cook the topping layer instead of microwaving it) and while it was a bit lengthy, completely worth it!

A friend of mine made these in high school. 2 years later there I was making them for christmas. They're delicious if you like mint. The top layer seemed the most difficult but you have to melt the chocolate on the stove with butter and just pour it on. I love these brownies :) except for the fact that I make a mess with food coloring !

Delish brownie that everyone loved and few asked for the recipe. Although... it was much much too sweet! Would be best to either cut out some of the sugar, or make sure one has insulin nearby (if eating anything more than a 1"X1" square). I had to eat it in small doses, and with milk on-hand.

Followed the directions perfectly, and they turned out great!!  A danger in fact because I couldn't stop eating them!  I brought them to an event and everyone loved them.  Foe some people they might be too sweet, but I thought they were great!!!

Absolutely delicious! My family loves mint and chocolate together so I made these for St. Patrick's Day. I used a brownie mix for the brownie base instead of the recipe to make things a bit quicker, and they turned out wonderfully!

I made these, they were good, but i did make some changes because i dont really like mint. I used banana extract, and yellow food coloring.  I halved the recipe because it would have been to much for us. They were definately a rich brownie, maybe a bit too sweet.  But then again i changed it up by doing the choc-banana thing. Definately drink lots of milk with these!

These were great and they got rave reviews at work.  I liked these better than the other mint brownies on this sight because they are much more brownie like.  I would suggest starting melting the chocolate for 40 sec. to get it started, then use 15 sec intervals after that to save a little time.  Don't cook too long without stirring though, or you may burn the chocolate.  Cut the bars small because they are rich!

I made the bars as stated in the recipe. I ended up baking them for 30 minutes. The outside edges are too hard to eat and the inside in still not cooked.

I just used a box brownie mix and it worked well.  Slowly add milk to green mixture.  The green was not as firm as I would have liked.
Overall, very pleasing appearance .  A little goes a long way.

These were just delicious! I made them for my husband's work potluck on St. Patrick's day. I sprinkled tiny green chocolate candies on top for more green color. I am thinking of modifying the recipe's middle layer for an Easter treat.

I cut the butter in the brownies to 3/4 cup because it seemed like way too much and I didn't want them greasy. They were perfect. I worried they weren't dark enough because the batter was really light in color, but they were just great. Next time I will cut the green frosting in half--I thought it was too thick.

This is a totally awesome dessert. I received many rave reviews from a group of 100 or so. Was a great St. Patrick’s treat. Beautiful presentation. I did cut back a little on the mint extract though.

These brownies are so delicious, reminds me of a york peppermint patty. Everybody loves them! Make sure to grease the pan well or the will stick badly. They are a little bit hard to cut as well, but worth it.

Was well liked by friends. The only trouble I had was the top layer didn't cover as well as pictured. People requested brownies to go. I would probably do a cream cheese middle next time I make them.

Wow!  Absolutely delicious - so rich and so full of flavor.  Also gorgeous to serve for company or bring to a St. Patty's party (as I am).  I followed Cher's recipe exactly - including her recommendation on melting the chocolate on the stove.  The texture of each layer is just right.  I did chill the final product longer than 10 minutes since I found it difficult to cut  until it firmed up a bit more - but that's a minor detail.    I am a dessert baking  fanatic -- and this one is really special!

This recipe received rave reviews from family and friends when I brought it to dinner last Thursday (St. Patrick's Day). Although it takes a little time to prepare, it all went together easily. A delicious blend of mint/chocolate flavors and chewy/creamy textures.

Overall this is a very rich dessert. The brownie turned out exactly how I like brownies, a little dense and good chocolate flavor. The middle layer was a bit overpowering and when I tackle this again, I will use a little less mint extract, which is why I rated four stars. The top layer I only used a tsp of vanilla which was the right decision for my tastes. Highly recommend using cupcake pan as its easier to layer and already portioned appropriately. This is definitely a recipe I will continue to tweak to my preferences but I feel like I am already three steps ahead starting out. Try this out!

Delicious, perfectly minty! Big hit at gatherings. They are very sweet, so I would suggest pairing them with something salty to balance the sweetness.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I even cooked it a little longer til jigging in center was not moving and the end result was a raw brownie with a "wet" bottom in the center. The green frosting was too rich for the brownie.  I made these for a women's group and will try to pass them off as candy.

Thought this was a great recipe, however I though that both the amount of sugar was far too much. Next time I'm going to try 2.5 cups in the base and less for the middle layer. I also substituted oil for the butter and came out great. Looking forward to seeing how it works with different flavorings.

I first made these quite a few years ago but forgot to post a review.  Made them again today, and they are delicious, even if I did cheat a bit and use a box mix.  Just the right amount of mint to complement the chocolate.  Yum!

I make this as our dessert exactly as written every year for Saint Patrick's Day.  The only problem is that I want to eat the entire pan by the time the kids get home from school!  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found that the brownie layer was still too moist (and actually greasy to the touch...) after the allotted time. Next time I make these, I might try it with 3/4 C butter, instead of the full 1 C. Other than that, these were scrumptious! The mint and chocolate combination is to DIE for! I only ended up using about half of the top layer, for a topping about 1/8 inch thick, but that's due to my own preference.

Only a 4 b/c the mint layer was WAY rich! We will be halving it & quartering the amount of mint extract next time, but there will DEFINITELY be a next time! (And hopefully soon.)

Super sweet -- so sugary that my teeth hurt after one bite! But everyone loved them, especially when the cookies had tempered from being in the refrigerator for several hours. I increased the topping by an extra 1/2, which made it easier to spread over the middle layer. My only complaint is that the middle layer separated a little from the bottom layer when I sliced and removed them from the pan.

I put my brownies in the fridge overnight and when I tried to cut them into serving pieces in the a.m., the chocolate topping started cracking apart, and I had to press so hard to get through it that I squished the icing in the center.  I don't think I'll be repeating this dessert any time soon.

I have made these for years using a brownie mix and frosting, topped with chocolate chips.  The chocolate is always an issue to spread.  But they are great tasting.

Something was off- too  much peppermint?  The brownie part seemed too dense.  These did not go quick in our house.  Will not make again.

I substituted 3/4 tsp peppermint flavouring for the vanilla in the base as well.  The middle layer will be minty enough with 3/4 tsp. of peppermint if you do this.  This makes an excellent addition to a Christmas goodie plate.

Turned out perfectly and were so sweet that we could only eat a one inch square.  I'm glad that I halved the recipe since they are so rich.  I will make many times more.

Delicious recipe! Made it for St. Patrick's Day Dessert and was a huge success. I used a cupcake pan to make them in and a double boiler for the chocolate. Pretty simple and turned out well!

I baked these for 25 minutes and then followed the directions from there. When I went to cut them, they were completely underdone in the middle...so much so that I couldn't cut them very well. :( They did taste great...just wished they were firmer.
