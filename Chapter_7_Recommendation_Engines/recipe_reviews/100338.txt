I am a comfort food, casserole fan, and this recipe fits the bill on both counts.  The spice choices are excellent, especially the red pepper flakes which provide just the right level of bite.  I only had enough cheddar cheese to cover half of the hash so I used a couple of pepper jack slices to cover the rest.  Honestly, the pepper jack side was better (of course I ate some from BOTH sides, whaddayathink!)because it compliments and continues the red pepper flake theme.  I don't see any reason for the rice to be "cold." The rice I used was still warm and it worked great.  Thanks for a great, down-home recipe!

This was way better than I expected!  I made it just because I had a pound of ground beef I wanted to use up and needed a quick dinner.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I think it was just a little bland - needed some salt and pepper and maybe a little heavier on the oregano and parsley.

This is a very good easy recipe.  The only changes I made were to use 3 cloves fresh garlic with the onions and Minute brown rice that was cooled.  also I omitted the  corn.  My wife is a very picky eater and loved this.  Will become a regular meal in our house.

Not bad, was looking for a way to use up the canned goods in my pantry as well as ground beef in my freezer, as i have been cooking more healthfully lately. This was not healthy, but tasted alright, reltavively bland, added extra red pepper flakes, also used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. It fit the bill as a quick meal, using up my ingredients. Would make it again if i was in the same situation, but definitely would not plan this as a meal.

I cooked the onion with the beef; I added the seasonings to the beef and onion while cooking...I did add a little salt...wasn't enough in my opinion. Next time I'll change the garlic powder to garlic salt. I used a 14oz. can of Green Beans, 1+ C of shredded Monterrey Jack, which I think went well with the dish. I will increase the cayenne pepper flakes to 1 t. and maybe use Pepper Jack cheese instead. I liked eating it as a dip with Tostitos.

Not terrible but not great either.  I used "homemade chicken broth" from this site in place of the beef broth.  I always use brown rice. I upped the garlic powder and decreased the oregano (our personal preference).  Next time, I'll toss in some green pepper (or red) and replace the cheddar cheese with velveeta.  There is real potential here.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used half the oregano called for because neither of us are huge fans of the taste.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will also cut the red pepper in half since it was a little spicy for my kids.  Loved it!

While this dish isn't the prettiest to look at, it is delicious. It's quick and easy to make. 
The only things I did different is to use fresh garlic and fresh corn off the cob which I cooked before adding.

Great starter recipe... I exchanged corn for green beans and added 5 fiery pepper seasoning for the red pepper. I used roasted minced garlic instead of powder and I also used dried chopped onion instead of real onion(I can't take the onion texture). A little italian seasoning took care of the too much or too little oregano. I only had a tiny bit of cheddar so i used what I had and added a little Gouda. Yummo.

We absolutely loved this, it is easy and very tasty.  5 stars defintely.    I ended up not using all the rice in it, ( I think about 1/2 cup of the cooked rice was left over.) and since my husband wont eat anything with mushrooms in it, so I used cream of chicken soup instead.   It turned out perfect.  Thank you for sharing this Dog Lovin' Mama, as this week you have made my dinner menu much easier.

My boyfriend liked it (or at least he said he did), but I found the oregano flavor to be a bit strong - it overpowered the other flavors, in my opinion.  I would consider making this again, but with half the oregano (or maybe none) and perhaps more garlic.

Found 2 cups of rice to be a bit much - would halve the amount next time. Doubled the spices (except the red pepper flakes) and still found it needing in the flavor dept. Might triple the dosage next time. Good and filling nevertheless.

Made this last night and it was great.  I added diced cooked potatoes to it because we had leftovers.  Because of the potatoes, I added another can of soup.  My hubby asked for seconds and that is saying a lot.  The spices are just perfect for the recipe.  Will make this a go to recipe when I want something simple and tasty.  Thanks

I didn't have the cream of mushroom soup, so I took another cook's suggestion and used a can of creamed corn.  I also used a full cup of beef broth to make up for "lost liquid" and used hash browns instead of rice (be sure to brown the hash browns good if you are going to use them - I only cooked them until they just started to turn brown).  It needed a pinch more salt, but my whole family enjoyed it - all 6 of us!  My husband added Texas Pete to it for his taste and I also added green jalapeno sauce to mine.  This one is definately a keeper.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added one cup of wild rice as well as the regular rice.  I did not have beef broth, so I a half a can of Campbell's french onion cooking soup.  I also only used half the amount of red pepper flakes, or I knew my kids wouldn't dig it.  It turned out to be pretty tasty.  Easy to throw together and 2 out of 3 kids approved.  The one that did not, does not like cheese...so it was pretty much to be expected.  =)

I made this tonight for dinner.  I used Italian seasoning as another person suggested.  I skipped the red pepper flakes.  I don't use cream soups (hubby is allergic to the MSG in them) so I substituted a quart of homemade brown gravy and a can of mushroom pieces for it.  I used 2 cans of corn & added 1 can of black beans for extra color.  I used hash browns instead of rice, and when I went to put it into the pan, I realized I'd forgotten to cook the onions with the burger.  So I put half the mixture into my 13x9 pan, then sprinkled it with the chopped onions, mushrooms, and 1 cup cheese, then put rest of mixture on top, cooked it at 400 degrees F (am at about 7000 altitude) for 25 minutes, put another layer of cheese down, cooked another 5 minutes til cheese is melted, then fed it to my family.  We are 7, and between hubby & 2 older boys, that size pan empties FAST.  It is a bit bland but we keep salt & pepper on the table for everyone to make it taste as they want it.

Not a fan.  I read reviews and understood  the recipe needs seasoning. I added 1/2 tsp each of oregano and parsley, and added Ortega chilies. Nothing helped. Now in stuck with all the leftovers. Recipe says 4 servings, more like 7 or 8.

This was okay for a quick, cheap dinner. You really do need the beef broth to add some saltiness and to keep the dish from being dried out. I used creamed corn and next time I will leave out the oregano - too strong and the flavor does not go well with the other ingredients.
