We really enjoy it. It has a great flavor and texture. I added a clove of garlic and sprinkle some chives on the top after baking for some decoration. I gave it 60 minutes in the oven to cook completely. I'm sure it can be eaten cold or hot. This recipe is a keeper.

Finally a breakfast casserole w/o bread!!  Due to a lack of ham & an allergy to mushrooms, I made this w/12 strips of crispy turkey bacon & tomatoes as the replacements. I eliminated the salt & used garlic powder & pepper. I think I will try feta cheese baked w/I next time & minced garlic. Thanks for the base!!

Made it for company as a quick breakfast/brunch dish. I used turkey bacon instead of ham, and egg beaters in place of the eggs. Everyone loved it!! I prepared the mixture the day before, then the morning I served it, I poured it into my 9x13 inch pan and baked it as directed. This will become a new go to for breakfast dishes.

Very delicious and easy to make. Made with just green onion, ham, and cheese. Can't wait to make it again with more ingredients!

This is a great recipe.  I think I overcooked it (but that's on me). Will make it again when we have guests.  I think you can have this for dinner as well- with salad and a vegetable.  Roasted asparagus would do well with this.

Loved this.  We had it for dinner and served with baked beans.  I didn't have onion, but 1 clove of garlic worked nicely.  I also added. some kale to make it healthy.

I used almond milk. Regular onion instead of green. And instead of red pepper,I used yellow....just cause that's what I had left and needed to get it used up.

Great. I make this often on a Sunday and then warm up a single serving for breakfast during the week. I hate sweet stuff for breakfast, so making ahead of time and popping it in the fridge makes for a fast, yummy breakfast for the whole work week. I usually put the shredded cheese right in the mixture, and I use a little more salt.

We chopped up green onions, jalapeños, added a cup of sour cream.  We used 8 eggs and poured into 8x8 and baked for 60 minutes. We served with salsa and it was awesome! We used ham and will use sausage next time.

I followed the directions.  I did add about a 1/2 cup cheese to mixture before baking. It did take longer than 50 minutes in the oven I used approx 90 minutes to cook then I added the cheese on top and melted and put in under the broiler from about a minute. Will bake again. Family loved it.

Great breaky! It was very tasty. I did half the  recipe for 2 people then cut the rest into squares for the rest of the week. It was delicious and breakfast was ready to go. I had it with pico de gallo on the side for added flavor and spice. It went nicely with it.

Loved it, very easy to make. Didn’t use the red bell pepper as I didn’t have any, salsa afterwards instead. My daughter doesn’t like eggs but had two servings anyway.Always a win for dad.

Made this for a breakfast party this morning and it was fantastic. Great texture to the eggs and I always love to find ways to use sour cream. This is so compatible to whatever you want to go in the mix. I used spinach, red pepper, tomatoes, ham, and havarti cheese on the inside with the cheddar on top--just be aware that you may need to use some extra salt on the veggies to keep the assembled dish flavorful. A winner that I'll use again and again!

I made a few changes to this dish.  First off, I only had 7 eggs so I made a few adjustments to the measurements so it would be balanced.  Less milk and sour cream, only 1/4 cup each.  I also did sausage instead of ham with onions and green peppers and cheese inside.  Since I had less ingredients I baked it for 40 minutes in the same size pan and it came out beautiful and yummy.
