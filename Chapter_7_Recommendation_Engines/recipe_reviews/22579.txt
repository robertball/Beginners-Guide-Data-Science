NOBODY in my family believed that I made this cake - they were convinced I bought it at a store or bakery! It took me half the afternoon to make it but well worth it! I'm not even a huge chocolate fan but I found myself wanting a second slice! If you want to make a good impression - invest some time and try this recipe! My guests and family alike all fell in love! Thanks a bunch Hershey's!

this is not a quick cake, so don't make it if you want something fast. however, if you have the time, it's well worth it, you will NOT be disappointed, and it's easy to prepare. they didn't have skor bits at my grocery store, so i crushed up some Werther's Original's candies. another change i made was doubling the glaze recipe. 
it's extremely rich, even a chocoholic had to eat it one piece at a time. the cocoa gives it a very moist flavor.

I made this for my dad for fathers day and the whole family loved it.  The cake is very moist, I'll use the cake part as my basic chocolate cake recipe from now on.  The directions mention adding egg yolks which aren't in the ingredient list (only whites) but I just added the two from the whites so I guess that was right.

I bake all the time and this is the best chocolate cake.  I added a little pinch of instant coffee to the chocolate glaze and it was delicious!!

This cake was awesome!!!  I recommend letting it chill for at least 4 hours to let it get nice and cold.  I'll be making this one again and again!

This cake was amazing!!! i made this for an English class project on society in England. We were doing different foods and i picked this one to make. Everyone loved it! People asked for seconds and the whole cake was gone by the end. I oculdnt find skors toffee bits so i bought (i think heath) traditional English toffee bites and decorated the top of the cake with them. It looked great!

Easy, but somewhat time consuming.  It is worth it though! I made it for valentine's day earlier this year, to the total amazement of boyfriend! It was a hit!  My roomates came drifting into the kitchen, asking "what's that smell?"  Your family will too, trust me!

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have ever tried.  The cake has a great texture, and the glaze is just the right touch.  I have served it at 2 parties and everyone has raved.

My cake didn't look quite as good as the picture but it sure tasted great! It was a bit time consuming but I've been in a baking mood so I didn't mind at all. I used two regular sized Skor bars (found at local White Hen Pantry) and instead of whipped topping (don't like it) used fluffy white filling from the site instead. Excellent. The oil really makes the cake moist and the glaze makes it very rich. I also dusted my cake pans with more cocoa instead of flour. I would do this again. Thanks.

This cake tasted good, but I won't be making it again because I've made other chocolate cakes that are less work and taste better.  The cake part was rather dry.  I do like the idea of using toffee chips and whipped cream between the layers of an even better cake, though, so I'm glad I tried it.

This is the best cake that I have ever made!  My whole family loved it!  I didn't have any light cream so I just added the whipped cream to the glaze sauce instead.  Also, I noticed that when I was ready to glaze the cake, the glaze became very thick when it cooled to room temp.  I just heated it on LOW and added more whipped cream and stirred until it was the right consistency again.  I will be using this cake again for birthdays and special occaisions!

I have made this cake more than 30 times over the years and have not met a person yet that did not love it! Instead of frozen topping I use real whipped cream.

This cake is absolutely incredible. It will now be my go-to recipe for chocolate cake; I can't wait to experiment with other fillings and frostings (although the "glaze" itself was out of this world--double it)! The cake is moist, rich, and chocolatey.

SPECTACULAR! Jaws dropped when I brought this to the table - definitely a good "TA-DAAAA" recipe.  Not a crumb lived to see sun-up - the small wedge that wasn't eaten at the table was snarfed down by a houseguest sometime during the night.  Definitely a keeper!

You've got to try this one; it'll really impress everyone. Relatively easy to make, and it's so yummy! The dutch process cocoa makes the cake gives the cake a really wonderful chocolate flavor--be sure not to use anything else. Next time I make this, I think I'll try making my own whipped cream instead of cool whip, not that it detracted from the flavor at all.

Very, very good chocolate cake recipe, but a little less dense than I expected. When I made the glaze, it was just barely enough to cover the top - next time I would double the amount and add a little bit on the layer w/ the whipped topping, along w/ 1/3 cup chocolate chips.

An impressive cake that looks deceptively hard to make. Not true!! 
Everyone will love this moist, rich, and crunchy (because of the toffee bits) chocolate cake!

This is an absolutely sinful chocolate cake...my second attempt (the first ended with egg white spattered all over the kitchen, me, and the dog...my fault) produced a delicious dessert.  The glaze is wonderfully fudgy and a perfect compliment...just make sure you grease the pans really well..mine stuck to the bottom but luckily it was just for the family.

I'm a big fan of baking cakes from scratch so the steps involved in this didn't phase me a bit.  It was beautiful to look at but my family just wasn't crazy about the taste of it.  They didn't care for the whipped cream between layers.  It just wasn't a big hit at my house.

Fabulous!!  It took first place in my school's bake-off.  Make sure that you use the Dutch processed cocoa.  I have made it with both regular and Dutch, and the Dutch rules!  It really makes a difference.  I also doubled the amount of glaze and drizzled some between the layers.

everyone loves this whenever i make it. the glaze and toffee is what really makes this cake stand out. if you're really looking for a shortcut, use a pre-mix for the cake, the chocolate glaze and whip cream is just that good. you'll barely be able to tell the difference.

I couldn't find all the correct ingredients so I used fair trade cocoa, wethers original toffees crunched up (difficult),1/2 pint of whipping cream for filling and normal milk instead of buttermilk. We are not big cake eaters but it still all got eaten, lovely.

This was one of three cakes I offered at a dinner party.  It recieved many ohs & ahs at 1st sight.  Was VERY simple to make & tasted great.  I didn't have any whipping cream, so I used "satiny chocolate glaze" recipe from this site.  Keep refrigerated to avoid mushy coolwhip.

This cake was beautiful and a hit with the family.  They have already asked for it again.
