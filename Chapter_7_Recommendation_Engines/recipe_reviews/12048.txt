Excellent base recipe!  I did some substitutions to cut calories a little.  Instead of the white sauce I used a vodka marinara.  I also used lean-ground italian-style turkey.  The filling was wonderful!

The shells tasted great but I had some trouble getting the sauce the correct consistency.  I will try again.

I was pleased with this.  It was fairly easy, you just need to pre-plan a little.  I thought the filling was very tasty; the pecans were a great additon.  I skipped the sherry and used a good swiss instead of the gruyere.  I used milk instead of the whipping cream in a effort to scale down on the calories.

My husband and I found this very tasty, but since we do not like the strong taste of sherry we substituted dry white wine and added chopped spinach to the mixture.  I also found it helpful to cut back on the shallots.  Very good!

Excellent, rich and creamy.  I used the 
long tubular pasta instead of the shells.

Just ok. We didn't save the leftovers. Not a lot of flavor.  Looks like it should taste fabulous, but it just doesn't.  I made exactly as written except added a bit of garlic.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using Swiss cheese.   It was ok, but to me was missing something.  Not to mention that it does take a while to prepare.

I made some changes to the recipe based on other reviews (adding some spinach, substituting  and using milk instead of cream) and the filling turned out dry and crumbly while the sauce evaporated when it baked, making the creation of a sauce a useless expenditure of work.  If I made the recipe again, I would add more ricotta to the filling and add less spinach and turkey.  I would bake the shells in vodka marinara and just sprinkle the cheese on top.

Loved it!  I made this for dinner and it so happened that a friend and her eleven year old daughter stopped by at the right time so they ate with us and truly loved it.

My sisters and I made this for a special birthday dinner. Although we were quite pleased, we'll do some minor tweaking next time (a little more cheese here, a wee bit less sherry there). Our unanimous complaint?This dish deserves a far more special sounding name!

I thought they were great.  Such a nice change from the shells baked in spaghetti sauce. Sort of more elegant.

This was an okay recipe.  My husband liked it, kids did not (even without the pecans)and I thought it a little bland.  Too much work for a not great result.  Fun to try though.

I thought this was very good.  I used the white part of green onions instead  of the shallots - our grocery store didn't have them.  I also think I will use the entire 15 oz. container of ricotta cheese next time as I really like ricotta cheese. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an awsome way to use leftover turkey! Everyone loved it so much and it was not hard at all!

This was really good.  The only thing I would change is the sauce.  Maybe a red sauce would have more flavor.  (My husband's suggestion!)

Delightful!  I had leftover chicken so I used that instead of turkey, I was drinking chardonnay as I cooked so I used that instead of sherry and I used a baby Swiss instead of the Gruyere.  One reviewer said they added garlic and it wasn't very flavorful but with the right cheese and NO garlic, it is a warm, nutty, flavorful dish.  (Garlic would totally overwhelm the subtler flavors.)  Oh and sage would be a nice addition and you could substitute pine nuts for the pecans.

Good but not a family favorite.
