Very tasty by following reviewer suggestions. I almost didn't make this since it isn't as low fat a recipe as I usually make, but I will definitely do again. I sauteed the mushrooms and shrimp together with extra garlic and white wine and slightly undercooked since I knew they would cook more when added to the sauce. I used 8 oz cream cheese, extra basil, and instead of water used 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 white wine and the liquid from after the mushrooms and shrimp had sat. Also added parmesan. I think next time I will try with lower fat cream cheese just to see if I can get the same results. I can see doing this in the spring with salmon and aspargus. YUM!!!

This could be a restaurant quality recipt with a few exceptions: Increase shrimp 1 lb., use cremini mushrooms, use fresh basil increase to 1/3cp and use flat leaf parsley. Double the garlic. Add 1/4 cp Marsala before adding shrimp and mushrooms. Serve with garlic bread.

This is absolutely amazing.  I did have to add some milk to make the sauce because without it, it was just too thick (you could add some of the pasta water too...if you prefer).  We loved this.  This would be perfect for company because it has great visual presence.  One of our favorite recipes from this site up to date.  Thank you for the post.

Awesome recipe! I used white wine and boiling water with 8oz of cream cheese and the sauce was delicious. Also, using a wire whisk to break up the lumps of cheese in the pan really helps. Yummy and simple.

I can't tell you how many times I've made this recipe.  Its amazingly easy and you'll get rave reviews from anyone who hasn't tried it yet.  The best part of this recipe is you can change it to your liking, add mushrooms or if you don't like them, use another vegetable like broccoli or asparagus or even pea pods!  I always add extra garlic just because I REALLY love garlic.  The recipe calls for shrimp, but I've also used chicken for this and pasta possibilities are endless!  Penne, cavatapi, fusilli, linguini, fettuccini.. I've even used chinese lomein noodles (for extra protein).  Fresh cracked black pepper to top this is a must it truly brings out the flavor of everything.  Go ahead, try this recipe and post your combination and thoughts!  :)

OOOHHH so good! This is another great recipe! I added a chopped green onion, a chopped green bell pepper and 1 chicken breast chopped (in addition to the shrimp)when sauting the mushrooms.  I also used cream cheese with chives.  It was heavenly! I served with "Spring Strawberry Spinach Salad" and "Great Garlic Bread" also found on this site and the combination was better than any restraunt! I will be making this meal again!

OMG - Very good! A new favorite for my boyfriend and I! Per others - while sauting the mushrooms, I added 1/2 red & 1/2 green bell pepper (chopped), apprx 1 TBLS minced green onion and 1 chicken breast (chopped). I too used cream cheese w/ chives and added a splash of white wine (not the cooking kind wht wine!) to the sauce. It wasn't too thick like others complained about and the flavors were great.  The addition of the xtra veggies made the dish look even more appealing! Served with garlic toast and you have yourself and great meal!! Thanks Karyn & All Recipes!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I added a full pound of shrimp.  For the mushrooms, I used baby portabellas, and they were terrific in this dish. I also used red. fat cream cheese, and about 1/4 cup of butter, to try to cut some of the fat.  The tasate was still wonderful!
 I will definitely make this again!

Definitely a keeper.  I followed some other suggestions by doubling the garlic and the cream cheese and adding 1/4 marsala wine.  I didn't quite add all of the water and added some parmesean cheese to thicken it up.  I used mini portobellos and extra shrimp and it was delicious!  Highly recommended!

This was AMAZING! I took the advice from another, and added 1/2 cup wine & 1/2 cup milk instead of water. Also added some chopped fresh tomato, topped with sprinkled parmesan cheese & chopped fresh parsely. Entire family loved it!!

excellent excellent recipe!  I would never have thought that shrimp and mushrooms were such a winning combination, but it worked!  And the dried basil with the fresh parsley complemented the sauce incredibly.  However, since I didn't want to shell out 500 cals just for a stick of butter, I changed the recipe as follows:  Brown the mushrooms in 2T butter, then add garlic and basil and saute for 1minute, then add the cream cheese and melt.  In a separate bowl, mix 1.5 cups milk with 2tsp cornstarch and add to the mushroom mixture, stirring until the sauce thickens.  Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute, or until warms through, then add the parsley and turn off heat.  Salt and pepper if necessary.

it seems so many folks love this...and yes it is good. my problem is it calls for too much water. i made as written...too watery for my taste. halve the water and it would be better. i won't waste shrimp again here, though.

Prepared this meal last night. Everyone loved it. I added scallops and chicken and used 1 pound of shrimp to this recipe. Seasoned and cooked all meat and seafood separately--added to sauce when time to serve. Used 8 oz of cream cheese. Sauteed fresh basil, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic,  before adding to sauce. I added vegetable broth and white wine to liquid make the sauce creamy. Definitely use a whisk to help break up the clumps as another rater suggested. This one is a keeper.

Since the submitter invites substitutions to her recipe in the introduction, I did.  I substituted white wine and heavy  cream for the water, and added some beautiful green beans with a bell pepper medley leftover from a restaurant evening out last night.  I added a glug of white wine to the mushrooms once they were cooked with the garlic and let that reduce almost completely.  Next came the (raw)  shrimp. which I cooked only a minute or two, knowing they would cook further once I added the cream cheese, butter and cream.  Once the mixture was creamy and smooth. I tossed in the leftover green beans  and  kept it on  the stove until it all was heated through, adjusting the thickness of the sauce, as needed, with reserved pasta  water.  The sauce was rich and creamy, very good, but not something I'd want to indulge in often.  I'm not sure I would have tolerated this well had I not mitigated the richness of it by adding a  good amount of vegetables.

This recipe is excellently good!! My family loved it.. The only changes I made were,  I doubled the shrimp in the recipe because it didn't sound enough to me & I added 1 can of evaporated milk instead of the pasta water in the recipe because I had a can that needed to be used up.  IMO, even after adding the evaporated milk, I could have added a bit of the pasta water to thin the sauce out a bit more.. It thickens on standing.  I also added some cilantro in place of parsley and basil.. Will make this recipe many more times for sure.. We all loved it on the day of making but I loved it even more cold from the fridge for lunch the next day..

After reading a number of reviews on this recipe, it was difficult to know how to go about making this.  Everyone did something different.  I’m not sure anyone made the recipe as stated, including me.  I will give this 4 stars, but my results were more like a 2, or 3 star at best.  I made half the recipe for the two of us.  First I sautéed the mushrooms in butter and removed them from the pan.  My shrimp were uncooked, so I sautéed them next and removed them as well.  Then on to making the sauce, which was where things headed downhill for me.  As per some other reviewers, I cut the butter slightly and doubled the cream cheese and instead of the boiling water, I used half white wine and half milk.  There was too little sauce and it was too thick (I’m sure because I doubled the cream cheese), so I added another tablespoon of each wine and milk.  Added back the shrimp and mushrooms and had a gloppy, unappealing dish to serve.  The flavor was ok, but nothing exceptional.  All of my negative comments are about what I made and shouldn’t deter you from giving this a try.  But if you do, don’t do what I did.

Absolutely delicious! I made three changes...added an extra clove of garlic (I love garlic!), used low fat margarine instead of butter and only used about a tablespoon where the recipe calls for 1/2c,  and used white wine and low fat milk to thin the sauce instead of water. Cut back on some of the calories and it was still spectacular. Had it with homemade garlic toast and a glass of white wine!

This is a 5-star recipe with a few changes.  First of all, I couldn't bring myself to use an entire stick of butter, so I cut back to 3 T.  I followed other reviews and used 8 oz. cream cheese, but that was too much so next time I will use 6 oz.  I also followed the suggestion to use 1/3 cup milk + 1/3 cup white wine instead of the water.  I doubled the shrimp to 1 lb, and used whole-wheat linguine.  My husband normally just thinks these types of dishes are okay, but he really liked this one, as did I.  I sent the recipe to my sisters (with my changes) and they and their families both loved it, too.  Will definitely make again!

I sauteed garlic, onions, and chopped spinach in butter. Added uncooked shrimp and cooked until slightly pink. I removed the shrimp and added mushrooms for a few minutes. Added 8oz of cream cheese, basil, and a few shakes of salt and pepper. Added some milk and pasta water until saucey. I shook some Mrs. Dash on the shrimp and then added it to the sauce. Heat through and served over hot pasta.

far too much butter  in the sauce- I used just a tablespoon and some milk along with the cream cheese.  Lacked vibrant flavor so I added some lemon zest and fresh dill.

It was very delicious.  Did use chicken broth in place of hot water.  Added a hint of red pepper flakes.  Used fresh basil chopped, didn't have fresh parsely had to use dry it was okay, think fresh would have been better.  Also used shallots and garlic.  Added parmesan cheese.  Thickened the sauce a tad with Wondra.  It was deleicous.  Family is too picky so no mushrooms which would have been good.  And used a pound of shrimp, but less would have been okay.  Very good!

My husband enjoyed this recipe. I was nervous when the cream cheese looked clumpy but it smoothed out after putting in the hot water. I doubled the recipe since my husband is a big eater. I also added chopped fresh spinach, some pepper and garlic salt. Next time I will try using chicken broth instead of water and see if it tastes even better!

I attemped this recipe and it turned out aweful.  The sauce was clumpy and bland.  Maybe because I tried to use lowfat cream cheese? Or maybe it was that I used dried herbs instead of fresh? But I think it still would have been very bland.  Im also not sure what the addition of 1/2cup butter adds to the sauce. It didnt blend well with the cream cheese, it was a just a pool of fat...  I was smart enough to taste the sauce before I added it to the pasta and was able to ditch it and made a sauce basically the same but without the cream cheese and added broth instead of water for more flavor.

I was really happy with this. It is the most fattening dinner dish I've ever made, but worth it =). Quite speedy too. I used baby portabellas--YUM!!!! I had to use BOWTIE pasta, but it was just fine indeed. I just couldn't add all that butter :( so I halved it in the sauce. IT DID NOT SUFFER. A quarter cup of white wine was substituted for the boiling water (HINT!! Use the PASTA water!!) and I added a bit more cream cheese, because the sauce was so thin. Finally I would highly recommend at least a pinch of cayenne...I added a lot more on my serving. I may try this again, using chicken, for guests!

Delicious recipe!! I did go along with some of the recommendations listed here and used 1 lb of raw shrimp, 6 cloves of garlic, no water, but used 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup milk. I also added about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese.

This is a really great basic recipe!  I used the increased garlic (5 cloves) and cream cheese (4-5 oz.), and milk instead of water as suggested by others.  I also added a bit of sea salt to the sauce and sauteed some onion with the mushrooms, tossed the shrimp & 1 c. asparagus tips in with them to heat a little & added all to sauce before using it to stuff crepes instead of serving with linguine.  My family, who once again thought I was nuts before they tasted it (crepes go with sugar, not shrimp! :-), demanded that I write it down immediately before I forget!

Thanks, Karyn, for the recipe--and thanks, reviewers, for some of the other ideas!

In between mouthfuls, DH told me not to lose this recipe.  To be fair, I gave this 5 stars, even though I changed it up a bit.  I doubled the recipe, but I used two 8 oz. bricks of cream cheese;  about 1 1/2 pounds of  shrimp; an Italian blend of spices instead of basil because of personal tastes;  thinned with milk (just eyeballed); and finally, some bell peppers were added.  As I was heating the sauce after adding the shrimp, mushrooms and peppers, I found that it became a little thinner, so if you're eyeballing it like I did, be careful.  This was incredibly easy and very quick to prepare.  The taste was wonderful and the presentation was impressive.  We eat a lot of seafood, so I will be making this often.  Thank you, Karyn, for the recipe.

I have made this recipe twice and thoroughly enjoyed it with a nice salad and crusty buns (to mop up the sauce!) The second time I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, used fresh basil along with the fresh parsley and as I had about 1 1/2 cups of spinach I needed to use up, I shredded the spinach and stir it just before I added the shrimp. My son was over for dinner the last time I made this recipe and he's saying he wants to be invited for supper when I make it again.

Ok, so I realized as I started this review, that I pretty much changed a large portion of the recipe, so let's just say I am recording and reviewing my version, so I can make it the same next time:)  I used rotini pasta, no mushrooms.  I used a full package of cream cheese, and I doubled the  garlic and spices, and added ground pepper.  I thinned out with white wine and skim milk, but don't pour the milk into the wine and then microwave it, because it will curdle, and then you will need to use more wine for the recipe, and drink more wine due to your own personal embarassment!:)  I added the cold white wine to the cheese, and once it was mixed in well I added milk a little at a time until i got the desired texture.  Also, as I taste tested, I found the sauce needed something else, so I added maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of grated parmesan and it was very good.  due  to no shrimp, I used canned crab meat, and it was delicious.  I added frozen peas at the last minute, and chopped bacon for dh and he liked his a lot.  I will make this again for sure.

My husband said he would pay for this at a restaurant! It is awesome. I made a few changes. I cut the butter in half and used fresh basil and used 3 cloves garlic. My cream cheese wanted to curdle in the butter even on very low heat, but once I added the boiling water, it got a lot smoother.

Loved this one!! Quick easy and ohh so good.. I cooked my shrimp with garlic and onion powder in some butter, and added a little salt and pepper to taste.  My baby girl ate it and she is even pickier than me!! will probably add something green next time or maybe some sun dried tomatoes!

I made it for my wife and I got lucky after supper... Changed some stuff though.  4 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup of white cooking wine.  Used portabello mushrooms, and shallots.  Ok so cook mushrooms in butter and set aside.  Then for the sauce do as instructed but add minced shallots about 3 mins after simmering, and instead of water add the milk and wine, stir often until everything is blended.  I cooked the shrimp and prawns (added for fun) in white wine sherry seperately. It sounds complicated but it comes together and tastes awesome.

A little bland and there wasn't enough sauce for the pasta.  If I make this again I'll make more sauce and spice it up a little.

This made a very good dinner. Like most cooks, I used the recipe as a starting point and adjusted to my ingredients on hand.  I used boursin instead of cream cheese, but do not think it would have changed my rating.  Thanks.

OH MY!!!! The pretty much perfect recipe I have looked ages for! I only made very minor changes - 8 servings takes the cream cheese to 6 oz, I used 8 oz, added a 1/4 cup white wine, used chicken broth instead of boiling water. The sauce was not too thick - actually a little thin, which made the leftovers even more phenominal (pasta didn't dry out)! I did splurge on the calories more and topped w/ fresh parmesan right before serving. Hubby wants to send a HUGE Thanks for sharing!!

I made this last night and it was a total disaster!  When I tried to melt the cream cheese into the butter (which is odd to start with), it just turned to a gummy, gooey, curdled mess! What did I do wrong?

Fabulous dish. I am still thinking about it. Used 8 ounces of cream cheese and a lot of garlic. Also added fresh ground pepper and seasoning salt. Didn't use water but skim milk instead. I think the sauce would do well by itself with no shrimp as a vegetarian dish or with chicken. Very quick and easy to prepare.

This was a nice change of pace. I did use 8 oz of cream cheese as others had suggested and I was out of basil so I used Italian seasoning instead. (not my intention.) But this was not bad at all. I think I will cut down on the butter next time though.

After reading reviews I felt the original recipe sounded a bit bland and utilized many of the suggestions and created a dish that my girlfriend proclaimed the best pasta dish she's ever eaten and I thought to be very, very good. I doubled the cream cheese, shrimp and garlic, used sliced baby portabella mushrooms, added  5 finely sliced green onions and diced sweet red and yellow peppers. I had only dried spices which worked ok and added a healthy dose of fresh ground black pepper. To thin I used 1/3 cup white wine and 1/3 cup half and half. Finally I grated about 1/2 cup fresh Parmesan into the sauce and a little more on top of each serving. Delicious! This recipe lends itself to experimenting and I'll try it not only this way again but with Marsala. Spicing it up a bit sounds interesting to.

I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese and since I wanted less fat and calories, I substituted plain greek yogurt for the cream cheese, warmed up with the butter on very low heat so it doesn't curdle.  I also used half the amount of butter and water to make the sauce creamier.  I was really good served with stuffed mushrooms.

This really is good, My husband said it tasted restaurant quality! It will make it into the rotation but I need to figure out a way to lighten it up even more.  I only used 2 tbls butter total, and 2 tbls of olive oil (next time just spray?). I used 6 oz of cream cheese (next time try light) fresh basil (use more next time) fresh parsley, a dash of marsala wine, dash of white wine. 1% Milk instead of water.  Added asparagus & diced onion, and bella mush, with 1lb of shrimp. Smart choice pasta. I need to add salt and pepper since I cut butter.  Served with Parm. cheese.  I could see baby spinach in it too.

I  modified this a lot based on what I had and the reviews, but I think it would turn out great as written, too. I sauteed a pack of mushrooms in an EVOO/butter combo with a big scoop of minced garlic, then removed them  from the pan. Added 1/3 c. butter + a big tablespoon of healthy butter substitute to the hot pan, stirred in about 7 oz. cream cheese and more garlic and whisked til it became a smooth paste. Added 1/2 can evap milk, several sprigs worth of fresh thyme and a big sprinkle of dried basil and simmered for a few mins.  Added a big splash of pasta water to thin it out a bit, then threw the mushrooms back in along with sliced chicken andouie sausage and simmered it all til the sausage was fullly heated.  Served it over gnocci with fresh parmesan, salt & pepper.  Sauce was fantastic and could've been done very quickly.  A definite keeper to try on different pastas (linguini next!) and with the shrimp or chicken.  Thanks so much!

This was so easy and delicious. I used less fat vegetable cream cheese. Next time I might cut back on the water as the sauce was alittle runny, but it was still good.

omg, this was honestly possibly the best recipe i have ever gotten from a site. i added extra parsley and less cream cheese, because when i reheated it (which is not particularily beautiful, but still tasty) i add a little bit to re-consitute. served ir with sauvignon blanc...magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!

This was absolutely delicious! The only change i made was that I used canned white clam sauce instead of the boiling water. I can't wait to make this one again. Thanks!

Delicious.  I modified the sauce to lower the calories/fat.  I used 8oz Neufchatel cheese, 2T butter, and 1/2 can (10oz) chicken broth.  It was wonderful, and my husband and son loved it.

This was very good with some changes based on personal preference and other reviews. I increased cream cheese to 8 oz, adjusted water to 1/3 C white wine, 1/3 C water.  I also sauteed cubed zucchini with the mushrooms - would actually be better with a whole pound of mushrooms.  very good!

Very good recipe! I cooked the whole 1 lb. pkg of extra wide egg noodles we used and used a little more than half of the package for this recipe.  I used the whole 8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese, cut the butter down some, added 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce and used skim milk instead of the water.  I also cooked some onions up with the mushrooms and added peas, sundried tomatoes and extra shrimp to the pasta (I cooked up the shrimp some with garlic and butter in a frying pan before adding it to the pasta and sauce. We all loved it! And made some crab cakes and sauce for a side.  Mmmm!

This recipe makes a very bland sauce. We've made is twice – the first time we doubled the garlic and thee sauce came out creamy but bland. We made it a second time thinking we missed something first time around. Nope, still bland. I do not recommend the recipe.

That was incredible!  My fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  We followed some of the customization suggestions.  I sauteed bella mushrooms, 1/4 red onion, 1 diced roma tomato, and garlic in olive oil then cooked the shrimp in 2 tbsp butter and another tbsp olive oil.  I cooked the rest of the garlic in the shrimp butter/oil, deglazed the pan with 1/3 cup Marsala wine (white wine could work too) and melted the cream cheese with basil, marjoram and red pepper flakes thrown in.  I reserved 2/3 cup of the pasta water to thin out the sauce and may consider using a smidgen more next time.  I threw everything together into the sauce and it was awesome.  Very delicious!!  Will use again! :)

This had some really good flavors, but it was way too greasy! The recipe calls for two sticks of butter; and you feel like you're eating two sticks of butter with each bite. Also, the cream cheese does not smoothe out. This won't be a repeat in our family.

My husband loved this!!!  I followed other suggestions and used 8oz of cream cheese. I also used half chicken broth and half water.  The sauce was thick at the end but some pasta water solved that problem.  This recipe will become one of our regulars!!

YUM, So easy to make! I doubled the sauce, and instead of using water I used chicken broth. I also used Italian seasoning and used a little onion when cooking the mushrooms.This recipe is gourmet.

My husband is a vegetarian so I made this sans the shrimp.  I just added extra mushrooms and some asparagus.  It was delicious! I think next time I would make it with angel hair.

Absolutely loved this receipe for the taste and the ease.  I added extra mushrooms and it caused it to be a little runny so next time I make it I will reduce the amount of water.

I had to substitute garlic powder and dried parsley and I also did not have basil (I'm watching a friend's house).  I thought it was pretty good, probably be better if I had all the ingredients.

This was easy and quick and delicious, BUT .... like other reviewers have noted, you need to DOUBLE the sauce, and add more garlic and black pepper.  I also added spinach for color.  I think next time I'll use penne instead of linguini.  I'll also think this recipe would be great using chicken or ham, and maybe not cooking the shrimp ahead of time.  But I will definitely make this again and again.

This is a great recipe that gives plenty of leeway for individuality!  I did make lots of changes, using what I had on hand and loved how flexible this dish is.  I divided my ingredients to make half with shrimp and crab meat and half with chicken (for the non-seafood eaters here ;-)  

My changes were: 
I used a whole 8 oz of cream cheese and 1 stick of butter (divided among the 2 pans).  I also added a good shake of Parmesan, 1 cup of diced tomato, a diced green & diced red pepper, and spinach to each.  I also substituted jarred minced garlic in EVOO in place of the 3 cloves.  To thin out the cream cheese while making the sauce, I used a small container of chicken stock and a little sour cream and milk.  I served this with Mama D's Italian bread (found here on AR) which I sliced and topped with butter, garlic salt, onion, tomato, spinach,  mozzarella, and Parmesan then broiled to brown the top.  Even my picky 9 year old loved this meal!

Followed the recipe to a 't' and it came out delicious.  Some observations that others have probably already mentioned:  I did all the cooking in one pan (shrimp, then shrooms, then sauce).  Love it!  The butter/cream cheese mixture curdled a touch while simmering, so I'll follow others' advice & warm those on low heat.  Once I added the boiling water, it mostly smoothed out.  Threw it all together, and voila!  A very yummy dish you can alter to your own preferences.

Extemely rich, tasteful and easy to make! If you're coming off a diet or feel like cheating (like me) you will love this. Sauteed the mushrooms with some shallots and used both fresh garlic and garlic butter throughout came out amazing! Great recipe!!

I made this tonight for dinner.  It was so easy and my  husband loved it!  I added some red pepper flakes (if hubby isn't sweating profusely, it's not spicy enough) and it worked.  With or without the heat, this dish is a winner!

Loved this dish.  I was able to cut back on the fat by using considerably less butter (used 2-3 T. total instead of 10 T.) and reduced fat cream cheese, and it was still rich and flavorful.  I used cold skim milk in place of the boiling water.  I also added a splash of white wine and some ground black pepper.

This recipe was great with the following modifications: double the shrimp, cook the mushrooms and shrimp with garlic and white wine and replace the water by 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup white wine and leftover liquid from mushrooms and shrimp like another reviewer mentioned. I would also add: serve with fresh ground pepper and parmesan cheese. Great side dish to go with this is the Lettuce, Avocado and Sunflower seed Salad from this site.

Saw this as a recommendation to a request and had to try it - has everything the husband likes! Had to use fresh basil (only kind I had), added 1 bunch of green onions and ended up using a whole block of cream cheese.  Will definitely make again.

With one alteration this recipe is amazing! Instead of a 3 oz package of cream cheese do a whole 8 oz! Its worth the extra fat. I also add fresh sliced tomatoes. I have served this with shrimp or with cubed, fried tofu- either way is delicious! I have served with linguini noodles, or with the "noodles" from a spaghetti squash- again, either way is delicious.

I made this tonight.  When I read the recipe to my husband he seemed less than thrilled.  Boy! did he change his mind.  I did change the cream cheese, parsley and basil to an equal amount of Boursin Garlic and Fine Herb cheese and cooked asparagus tips with the crimini mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used whole wheat linguine.  It's going to be a regular in our menu.  Yum

This was more simple than I thought it would be to cook, and tasted great.  I did make two changes: I purchased raw shrimp and pan fried them in 2 tablespoons of butter before sauteeing the mushrooms, and I added about two tablespoons of pesto to the sauce.  Yum!

Very easy to make. Tasted quite good. Took a few shortcuts. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I used canned mushrooms at Step 3 and skipped Step 2 entirely. Didin't have the parsely either, just omitted it outright. I was a little concerned when it seemed I had melted butter with tiny pieces of fried cream cheese and garlic. But after the boiling water was added and stirring continuously, everything did eventually smooth out. I might try with a little less butter though.. I There seemed to have a lot left on our plates. Melted butter... sooo good, but soooo bad....

this is an amazing recipe! i suggest u double up on the shrimp and add some extra mushrooms unless u put some other kind of veggie in it i have done double mushrooms and i have also done broccolli w it. i also put a dash of pesto in it just to give it a little bit more of a kick, but i would def double up on the shrimp bc that was the first part of it to go lol! but its amazing and has a wonderful taste. i always make the dinner at night for th next day and its even amazing when warmed up.

This recipe needs a lot of doctoring.  All we could taste was cream cheese.  We even used cremini mushrooms and still could only taste the cream cheese.  I definitely will work to fix this recipe, so that the next time we make it, it will have more flavor than just cream cheese.

This was very good. My husband hates mushrooms, so I substituted broccoli. He thought just the broccoli would be good with the cream sauce, and I agree. Thanks Karyn.

this was really nice. I did as a few other reviewers, here are my changes: i put frozen peeled and deveined shrimp, garlic and mushrooms together to cook in butter (saves a few steps). Added the cream cheese and spices and a cup of milk instead of water. Turned out fabulious and super easy! Thanks for the recipe even tho i altered it.

Very simple to make.  I did not use plain water however.  I splashed some white wine and used a cup of chicken broth.  Next time, I will add the shrimp at the very end.  The simmering time suggested resulted in over cooked shrimp.  Nice and easy recipe overall.

I love creamy sauces and this was so good, especially considering how easy it was! I used more shrimp and garlic but only had dried herbs and mushrooms on hand, can't wait to make it with fresh ones. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe 'base'.  This seems to be a very simple and versatile recipe to adapt to chicken and pork, as well as other veggies.    I took few other reviewers suggestions and used 1lb of shrimp (we LOVE shrimp), 8oz of cream cheese, 1/3cup white wine & 1/3cup boiling water, 1lb of mushrooms (we LOVE mushrooms too).  My addition was a diced and sauted yellow bell pepper.  Dinner was great and the leftovers were even better the next day!!!

I was very impressed with this meal. Served it at dinner this evening and my family finished it off! I used 8 oz of lower fat cream cheese and added some milk to thin. Will be included in our rotation.

Good change of pace from the norm.  Absolutely MUST include parsley and basil for this to REALLY work.

This was an excellent recipe. However, I did have to make a few substitutions just because of what I had on hand. I used angel hair pasta and I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used a small can of stems and pieces. Also I had a jar of minced garlic so I used as directed to equal the 2 cloves. Everything else was basically the same. Thank you for such a great recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

this was the best and for sure the simplest recipe for a creamy sauce ever! Of course, I made it with a low fat cream cheese, cooked my mushrooms on low heat with 1 tbs of butter (covered for the first few minutes), 2tbs of butter to melt the cream cheese (very low heat and constant mixing), replaced water with skim milk, and added 1 tbs of hot pepper flakes for an extra kick- yummy with half the amount of fat than the original recipe!

My BF said this was out of this world great!  We both really loved the sauce.  I steamed fresh raw shrimp and also added some spinach at the end.  I used fresh basil, since we have tons at the moment.  Also used baby Portobella mushrooms. This would also be really good with chicken or other kind of seafood.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Karyn!

This is soooooo DELICIOUS! I wanted to use 1 pound of linguine, so I used a whole 8oz. block of cream cheese, but kept the other sauce ingredient measurements the same. Instead of using the boiling water to smooth out the sauce, I used fat free milk, just to keep it a nice creamy consistancy (I didn't measure it, just added until it was the consistancy that I wanted). I did have to add some salt and pepper, but that's a personal preference and I used a larger sized salad shrimp. This was super simple, but tasted like it took some time to make. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really yummy! Will definitely be making this again! I doubled the sauce though (therefore doubling some of the ingredients), and let it evaporate in the pan a bit... got it really smooth and not too liquidy or thick.

This was a simple recipe with lots of flavor!  I love this dish.  My modifications:  I sauteed raw shrimp instead of buying cooked shrimp.  I used fresh basil.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the butter; I like lots of sauce.  I also used baby portobello mushrooms.  Delicious!!!

Very yummy! I added white wine, upped the garlic to five cloves and thinned it out with a bit of milk. I also used about 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning in place of the dried basil. I used extra virgin olive oil in place of all the butter. It was so good there weren't even any leftovers!

All I can say is WOW!  I made this for my mom's birthday and we LOVED the sauce.  I omitted the mushrooms due to personal preference and I made a side of chicken for the non shrimp eaters.  Fantastic!  I will be making this again and again.

How simply delicious! I was unsure about the cottage cheese consistency the cream cheese had while simmering. I thought I did something wrong so I tossed the butter and cheese and started again. It looked the same but everything changed once I added the boiling water. I added fresh parmesean and hot pepper flakes for an extra touch of flavor. I, also, used farfalle since I was out of linguine. Perfect dish, not too heavy!

Used 8 oz low fat cream cheese, added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup skim milk. Also added asparagus spears to the mushrooms. Make sure to salt and pepper to taste. Is bland without seasoning. Doubled the garlic. Used whole wheat linguine. Restaurant caliber pasta dish!

This was great!!! I love cream sauces and this was SO EASY!!! Taking other reviewers' advice, I used 8oz of cream cheese and a mixture of white wine and pasta water to thin the sauce (no butter), and added garlic salt and fresh ground pepper. My boyfriend LOVED it (altho I admittedly added too much pasta and it became a little dry but that was my fault) and this is my new favorite pasta recipe!!!!

This went over really well. I made it last night and I tried to lower the fat too!! I used reduced fat cream cheese, skim milk, and less butter than called for (about 1/2). Subbed chicken for shrimp. Doubled the sauce ingredients (except butter), used skim milk (heated in micro) for boiling water, added 1 tsp. dried chives, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. salt, 1 can drained diced Italian tomatoes, 1 cup Parmesan cheese at the end and added 2 cups frozen peas to cooking pasta in last 2 minutes to boost the veggies. Don't worry if the sauce looks a little thin; it thickens as it sits. Thanks for posting this dish; I'm sure I'll get requests to make this one again.

This recipe was just okay in my opinion. It wasn't outstanding in any way and tasted like it lacked something. Plus all the butter made it seem really heavy. I probably won't make it again any time soon.

We make this all the time.  I like to add more mushrooms and shrimp than this calls for.  If you want the sauce to be a little creamier, add more cream cheese.  Parmesan is good to add at the last minute!

This was very good. Added Parmesean cheese, onion and used milk and wine instead of water.  Sauteed shrimp in chili oil before added to the sauce.

Really easy and really good. Even kids who aren't sure about seafood  enjoyed it. I used a little more garlic and reduced fat cream cheese, also milk instead of water. I think double the sauce with 12 ounces of pasta would be have been ideal. Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper!

This was really good, but I'm rating this a 4 because the cream cheese wasn't totally smooth in the sauce.  This might be because I let it soften for a few hours before cooking.  Next time I will try using this right out of the refrigerator.  I used all the water (others have said you don't need all the water), and my sauce was still pretty thick.  As recommended by other reviewers, I used 4 cloves of garlic, 1 pound of shrimp, and all 8oz. of the cream cheese.  Other than that, it had a great taste... very rich.  I'll probably try this one again.

This recipe is awesome!  I made this for a dinner party, and everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was adding a little salt and pepper to the sauce.  Otherwise, it's perfect!  Served with Olive and Cheese bread (recipe on this site), salad, and a bottle of Muscado.  Yummm!!

Wow... I made this with a few changes and it was wonderful...I used 5 cloves of garlic, 250 gr of cream cheese,1 pound of shrimp and about 1 pound of mushrooms, and 500 gr box of linguini.  My son in law was licking the sauce off my daughters plate.  This is restraunt quality.  The next time we are going to add some scallops.

After reading reviews, I made sure to have extra cream cheese and milk (instead of water) on hand so I could play with the consistency until I was happy with it. I, too, increased the garlic (6 cloves), and added some sauteed onion and bell pepper. I'm partial to oregano, so I just used a lot of Italian seasonings instead of what was called for. Delicious, but too rich to be served regularly. Yummy with lots of grated parmesan! ...update... great suggestion by RC Miller. I would have never thought of adding uncooked shrimp at the end, but it works great!

i made this for my boyfriend & he really enjoyed it!   a big thumbs up for the taste, the sauce was really rich & would definitely appeal to those who like their pasta sauces creamy & cheesey.  however i needed to make more sauce than was actually needed (i just added a lot more cheese & slightly more butter) because it didn't seem to be enough as i was making the sauce.  also i added more prawns.  i also took the advice of the other reviwers & used cream cheese with garlic & chives, which gave it a wonderful taste.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all.  I like a lot of flavor and found it very bland.  It wasn't salty at all and I could barely taste the garlic. I may try making this recipe again sometime, but next time I will definately add 2-3 more cloves of minced garlic and about a  teaspoon of salt or so.

This is one of the most delicious things I have ever made.  I've made it three times already (for company two of those times) and there are never any leftovers.  It's definitely a restaurant-quality meal.  Served with a nice salad and crusty garlic bread, it's a perfect meal.

I did not have cream cheese, so I added a tablespoon of flour to the shrimp/ mushroon mixture, sauted for a few minutes.  Then I added chicken broth and cooked a few more minutes  to thickened. WOW! Everyone loved this recipe.

I used raw shrimp and cooked it in the butter/garlic mixture before adding the cream cheese to maximize the shrimp flavor.  I also used white wine instead of the water, and thin spaghetti.  It was delicious.  I highly recommend it.

Made this tonight. Doubled the shrimp, added wine to mushrooms, and used 8 oz. cream cheese. I had bought some seafood from a door-to-door truck salesman, and this was the first recipe we made that was good. I have never used precooked, frozen shrimp before. So. Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!

My husband said this is the "baum diggity!" Everyone loved this recipe, made exactly like it is written except that I used three cloves of garlic instead of two and milk instead of water. This will go into the family treasury.

Awesome dish! I did double the cream cheese and added bay scallops along with the shrimp (both frozen).  I sauteed the mushrooms and added the shrimp & scallops to the same pan to cook, then poured everything, juices and all into bowl and set aside.  When making the sauce, I added the juices from mushrooms/shrimp/scallops instead of adding the water.  I also used angel hair pasta instead of linguini to lighten it up.

My family liked it but if I make it again I willl likely cut the butter down by 1/4 cup for the sauce. By the time we finished eating it there was a pool of butter in our bowls. Also, I used bowtie noodles instead of linguini.

Very yummy! I used dried parsley (didn't have fresh) and I used half as much cream cheese b/c that's all I had on hand. Still turned out really tastey.

This was super easy to make and delicious. My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I sub'd broccoli. I added all the ingredients (minus the pasta) at once in one pan with frozen pre-cooked shrimp. I didn't add the boiling water as the frozen shrimp provided water. It turned out delicious. Will definitely make again.

All I could say was OMG!!!  This was so simple to make and oh so delish!!  I'm a veggie freak, so I added broccoli and diced orange peppers to the butter and mushrooms.  I also used about a cup of fat free milk instead of water.  It was an instant hit in my house!

I wasn't sure about basil in this dish, but it was good.  I used an assortment of crimini, shitake and oyster mushrooms. This sauce thickens quite a bit once it begins to cool so make sure it is a bit thinner than you think it should be before putting it over the pasta.  Wonderful dish :D

This was great! The whole family loved it. What a great way to use leftover shrimp. The only change I made was replacing the mushrooms with red and orange bell peppers (which was a great decision). A little red pepper flake on top (for those of us who like life a little more spicy) was a great addition too.

We made this, but substituted chicken.  I really liked the flavors and it was very simple to make.  I thought that overall, it was just a little too rich for our tastes.  Not too over the top, though.  We added parm. cheese at the end.  We will make this, again.

This was delicious!  I cut the butter in half, and added 4oz of cream cheese - this was perfect for my tastes!  I think the 1/2 c of butter is a little much.  I also substituted the boiling water for milk, to make a creamier sauce.  It was the perfect consistency, and wonderful all around!

If I ever make this again I will do two things: chop the mushrooms in half (after sauteeing) and the shrimp into half or thirds. 

Secondly I will correct this sauce. A stick of butter with only 3oz of cream cheese is down right stupid. I had butter drenched everywhere. It wasn't easy to get the sauce to become smooth, but after cranking up the heat we got it to cooperate. Next time I may try the full 8oz or just another reviewer's suggestion of adding Marsala or some other wine and milk. 

Still quite good because it has butter, pasta, shrimp and mushrooms. Maybe 3.5 stars...

Delicious and the most inexpensive thing I have prepared in a while (less than $20). It made 4 large servings. The sauce is not heavy but full of flavor. Have I mentioned the main ingredients are butter and cream cheese?  I was tempted to double the amount of seafood it called for but I didn't and was thankful.  Don't over do this recipe, the portions are perfect.

I modified this recipe a little: used white and cremini mushrooms, shrimps and scallops, as well as 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of white wine. Overall, the recipe was good (very high fat content though!) but I found that it was missing a little something (besides salt and pepper). I might use onion and chives cream cheese instead next time.

This recipe is awesome. AWESOME! I used 1 pound of 51-60 count shrimp, so they were small and it looked like there was a TON of shrimp. Also I halved the butter in this recipe. I didn't think that much was necessary. Otherwise, I did everything EXACTLY the same. For the boiling water, I used pasta water. I also only had farafelle (bowties) and this turned out ADORABLE! Thank you SO much!

This was really good. Not bland at all like some of the other reviews.  I used 4 oz of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 lb of shrimp and mushrooms.  I will definitely try and reduce the butter next time around as it does add a lot of calories.  I also used Dreamfields pasta to reduce the carb load.  This will absolutely be made in my house again.

This was DELICIOUS!! I used 8oz fat free cream cheese and added about 1c water to thin out the sauce. Doubled the garlic (we love garlic!), and used 1lb shrimp and 1lb fresh mushrooms. It was very good - will definitely make again.

yummy yummy yummy!  i made the following changes to save a little on fat content-- only 1 stick of butter, and 1/3 fat cream cheese instead of regular; i still felt that this was a very rich dish and will probably use even less butter next time.  i also used 1 lb. of shrimp instead of 1/2 lb and added a little flour to give the sauce a more body.  Don't worry if your sauce isn't smooth right away, i found that when you add the boiling water and use a whisk to stir it formed into a typical creamy sauce.  I served steamed asparagus on the side and that seemed to compliment well.

Great and super easy.  I used 8oz of cream cheese and didn't have any fresh parsley on hand so I used dried.  I also added bacon and increased the shrimp to 3/4lb.  YUM!  Thanks for a super recipe!

Absolutely delicious! An quick and easy crowd pleaser. I am sad because I don't have left overs. I think the only change I made was adding a bit more garlic (because I LOVE me some garlic) and instead of boiling water, I heated up chicken stock and poured that in instead. I also added a little more milk just to make it a little runnier than it was already. SO good! A recipe keeper and will definitely make it again!

Made this tonight.  I haven't tasted it yet but i does look good.  Made a few changes...save a few steps and cooked the mushroom and garlic together....used 8oz of cream cheese and penne pasta.  Not sure why so many people made so many changes, this recipe seems fine the way it is.

Good base recipe! Followed recommendations and used white wine to thin the sauce.  Added Penzeys Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle seasoning along with the other herbs which made it a make again recipe for us. Served over homemade spinach linguine- Very Tasty- can't wait to try it with chicken and mushrooms

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST LINGUINI PASTA DISH RECIPE ON ALL OF PLANET EARTH!!!  I truly cant say enough about it.  Oh my gosh it is good!  I made it for a big party and my neighbors did not believe I made it.  They kept insisting that I ordered it from a fancy Italian restaurant in our area.  100% 5 STARS!!

Really awesome recipe. Very basic so it can be added to and suited for different meats and veggies, but also great all by itself. Followed the recipe (minus the mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand) and came out PERFECT. For people who reviewed and said it was too thick, in step 3 it says to "mix in boiling water until sauce is smooth" there should be no reason for your sauce to be too thick :)  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful!!  I did make a few changes like some reviewers had suggested.  I used 8 oz. cream cheese with chives, added a touch of cayenne pepper, evaporated milk instead of water (it had to be used up), added onions and used crab meat instead of shrimp (had it on hand).  I also used Spaghetti Squash instead on Linguini which I think made the dish.  As I do not measure ingredients, I guess I made it my own recipe.  My husband loved it as so did I.  Will definitely make this again!

This was great! I doubled the whole recipie and it worked fine. I added lots more agrlic, and because my husband doesn't like mushrooms I wilted spinach and added peas instead.  Peas are awesome in a creamy sauce like this.

I followed the advice of using white wine, and the extra garlic, I also used 1/2 fat cream cheese, and instead of regular mushrooms I used portabella, I would recommend using 4 large portabellas.  I also added sundried tomatoes in oil.  This was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

This was really yummy, but I don't like how much butter it calls for. I did reduce it as much as possible (about half), and added about half a cup of white wine.  I also used capellini pasta instead of linguini.

Excellent pasta dish. Very tasty, and easy to prepare. I took the advice of some other reviews and used part milk and part marsala wine with the boiling water and cream cheese. Also used sundried tomatoes, red peppers, fresh basil and fresh parsley. Good one.

I was so glad to have read some of the reviews before making this dish.  Used less butter and added white wine and chicken broth to thin the cream sauce.  I also used 8oz of reduced fat cream cheese and the sauce came out just fine.  Sauteed chopped red pepper with the mushrooms and topped the dish off with chopped green onions -- made such a pretty presentation.  My husband (who loves lots of flavor) thought this was delicious and not too heavy or rich.

We were not blown away by this recipe but is a good base to start with.  I will make again using more cream cheese, about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, chicken broth instead of water, add some green onions, a pinch of cayenne, and use raw shrimp seasoned to taste and grilled; for presentation will lay the grilled shrimp on top of the tossed pasta, mushrooms, and sauce.

I have been trying for years to duplicate restaurant pasta and this is the "spot on" recipe! It was a huge hit for my family. I made a few subtle additions. I added 3 TBSP of minced onion to the mushrooms, used chicken broth to smooth the sauce (instead of plain water), added 1 can of drained petite diced tomatoes and 1 cup of coursely chopped fresh spinach (all done in a dutch oven). I also used raw white peeled shrimp which I feel is more tender than precooked. I topped it with fresh parmesan cheese and served with a loaf of hot Italian bread. It was also great leftover, as most pasta is! Beautiful presentation as well.

Excellent!  I used raw shrimp, which I cooked with the mushrooms with an additional clove of garlic.  To make it healthier, I tried replacing half of the butter with olive oil, but it didn't combine well with the cream cheese.  Next time, I would just reduce the butter.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and served it over whole wheat linguini.  It was delicious!

Ok...this was the BEST pasta dish I have ever made. And it was super easy! I made a few changes because I was serving more people. I doubled the shrimp and mushrooms. I used 8 oz of cream cheese for more sauce, so I also added lots of extra fresh garlic (as I am a garlic LOVER), doubled the fresh parsely, and added extra basil! This was so yummy! Will definitely make this again and again.

EXCELLECT!  I made a few changes and followed some of the suggestions.  I cooked the shrimp and mushrooms together and added crab with butter garlic and wine.  Instead of the water I added milk and doubled the garlic and a little more wine.  At the end I added a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce to give it a zing. After mixing the sauces with the pasta I added ½ a cup of chopped green onions. Delicious!!!!

I made this for guests and it received rave reviews.  I am definitely happy that I made extras for left overs because I craved it the next morning and had some for breakfast!!  Great recipe, and I didn't change anything.

This is the most delicious shrimp pasta recipe.  I did follow the suggestions from other reviews and added white wine.  I, also, cooked a full 1 pound of shrimp and used 8 oz of cream cheese.  Make sure and let your sauce and herbs simmer for 10 minutes before adding the shrimp back in.  I also used a lot more garlic, because I love it, but I also added steamed asparagus to give it some more color.  Everyone loved it, just beware it is rich, but so worth it.

This was sooooo good! The sauce was a little thin, but it kinda latched onto the pasta and made it really cheesy! I doubled the recipe. So good!!

My fiance loves when I make this... I sub broccoli for mushrooms since he doesn't like them.... One suggestion though would be to double the sauce recipe and add parmesan cheese... I used whole wheat pasta and it soaked up what little sauce there was... but doubling it makes plenty of creamy cheesy sauce

My girlfriend and I just made this for dinner right now and it was exquisite, definitely like a 15 dollar meal at a restaurant...take some of the hints and add a little milk and we like mushrooms so we put 12 oz of the crimini mushrooms in...definitely use cream cheese with chives...next time I think we will add some chicken and green onions too! sooo delicious!

Excellent -- I did leave out more than half of the butter; just couldn't bring myself to add that much, but it would have been better with it.  I'll add onions and spinach next time, but this was great without them.

I absolutely loved this dinner.  I actually had friends over for dinner and they loved it too!  The only thing I did different was add zuchini which I sauted with the fresh mushrooms.  VERY YUMMY, will do again and again.  Thanks!

I made this using fat free cream cheese, light butter, substituted water with white wine and skim milk, and added canned clams including some of the juice and it came out DELICIOUS!  Tasted just as good as any restaurant pasta dish.  Will definitely make again.

It was fabulous! I only had half a block of cream cheese so I added some feta and it worked well. I thought it lacked some colour so I tossed in some chopped red pepper at the very end which added a nice crunch.

I think the list of ingredients should have included salt and pepper. I cut on butter, added more garlic, lots of Parmesan and black pepper, and a little salt, and it turned out pretty good. A very good dish for a change!

I also used more cream cheese, but I wish I'd added more water too - the pasta really soaked up the sauce, and became kinda gluey and clumpy. Very nice flavor though. Thanks, Karyn!

I made this for myself and it was fantastic! It was pretty easy too. Iused half of the water and added white wine as suggested. I also added parmesan which really helped bring out the flavor. My husband doesn't really like shrimp or mushrooms but he said it was pretty good, next time I will add chicken and see how that turns out.

This recipe is delicious as is.  Some suggested using chicken stock instead of the boiling water.  I have tried both and definitely prefer it with the boiling water version.  The chicken stock has an overpowering flavour.  Great recipe!

Wow! Simple and simply delicious. I had raw shrimp, so sauted them with the mushrooms. Taking a queue from others, used 6 oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter and substituted milk for water. Make this dish - you won't be disappointed!

This was amazing - the aroma of the herbs filled the whole kitchen and was so appetizing that my (normally shrimp-hating) husband ate half.  And he wouldn't stop raving!  The only change I made was to add a tad more cream cheese.  Otherwise - perfect!

Excellent, but I have a tough grading scale. Only gets a 5 if I don't have to change anything. I did this one as recommended. And then modified the second.  Used 1lb raw devained shell-on shrimp, cooked in a bit of white whine then peeled before adding to sauce.  Also used dried morel mushrooms. Added 1/2 cup of white wine instead of water. 5 ounces of cream cheese. Used fresh basil and extra garlic(always).  Added green onions,cracked pepper and 1/4 cup of parmesian 5 minutes before serving.  Also excellent with grilled then sliced pork tenderloin!!!

this was FANTASTIC!  no gooey mess here. I used shiitake mushrooms and NO BUTTER at all, just olive oil and less of it than the butter called for in recipe (a little more healthy too).Also used the low fat cream cheese. i used pasta water as another reviewer suggested and thinned the sauce with fat free evap milk.  VERY creamy and rich.  I served with a ceasar salad.  very, very good!

This a great recipe!  However, I did double the sauce and added some chicken broth to it because it was a little dry when I made it according to the directions.  I also added chicken to it.  I made this for my family and brought the leftovers to work and everyone raved about it!!  Will definitely make this again.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!

Delicious!  I made it with the 8 oz of cream cheese and substituted chicken for shrimp.  My husband commented that it tasted almost exactly like one of his favorite dishes at one of our favorite Italian restaurants!  Would definitely make again.

awesome recipe, next time i will add twice the cream cheese (6 oz), and also try and add less water...be careful all 2/3 of a cup is not necessary and will just make the sauce drippy. i also used baby portabellos for the mushrooms and i would add more of them next time also. i also used more than a 1/2 pound of shrimp...i like having lots of substance in pasta dishes, unlike when you go out to chain restaurants...i will definately make many many more times

This is amazing.  I make it all the time, its so easy and its resteraunt fancy.  I usually add a little more cream cheese and boil off some of the liquid so that it will be a thick sauce.  Sometimes I half-double the sauce recipe too.  Serve with french bread toasted in the oven with a fresh garlic butter mixture. Its sooo good.  Be careful not to boil until it is thick as it thickens as it cools.

I followed the other reviewers advice and increased the cream cheese to 8oz. I also sauteed some leeks with the garlic, and added cracked red pepper.  It was a hit.

I expected better after reading all of the reviews.  Unfortunately, this is just a dressed up version of fettucine alfredo, and my alfredo sauce is 10 times better than this one.  In fact, when I first tasted this, there was absolutely no flavor! After dousing it with plenty of parmesan and fresh ground pepper, it was quite tasty.  But, take my advice:  use you own tried and true alfredo sauce and just add sauteed mushrooms and some shrimp.

I am really glad that I found this recipe.  It's simple, quick, and so delicious.  It's also easily modified.  I left out the mushrooms and used asparagus like some of the other reviewers.  I could also see making this recipe with chicken, and any other vegetable.  And don't worry if your butter/cream cheese mixture looks lumpy, like the recipe says, it REALLY smoothes out as soon as you add liquid.

Excellent! This came in handy on Mother's Day when there was a last minute change of plans and I needed to quickly find something to whip up for mom. She's a devout shrimp lover and the recipe seemed easy enough and had great reviews...and for good reason!!  It was full of flavor...I definitely would recommend using milk vs water and 5oz. of cream cheese vs. 3oz.  The cream cheese and basil were essential in bring this dish together.  Next time I may experiment and add different vegetables but follow the recipe as is and you won't be dissapointed!

DELICIOUS!!! I changed it up a bit though and I think it made it even better: I added some chopped red onion to the mushrooms (I used 16oz of fresh mush because we are mush lovers) and sautéed it together until tender (~20 min).  While that cooked, in a separate pan I made the rest of the sauce using low fat chive and onion sour cream (8oz)and fat free half and half instead of the boiling water.  My sauce became a little runny so I used a little corn starch to thicken it up.  I also used the small salad shrimp and just cooked it when I added it to the sauce.  It was so easy to make and my entire family loved it. I will be making this again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe Karyn!

i only had half a package of cream cheese so i also used a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup w/ 1/2 cup of milk and it was amazing! not as cheesy as a regular alfredo sauce but more of a creamy cheesy sauce... great for ppl that don't like regular alfredo sauces. i also used sauteed onions and added some cayenne pepper to the sauce for a little kick... wonderful!

This was great, I had co-workers over and everyone enjoyed the dish.  I made a few modifications to add flavor, onions, garlic powder and I used milk instead of water.  It was such a hit, they polished off the leftovers the next day for lunch!

I think this recipe is great as it is.. However, I like to add diced fresh tomatoes and sliced steamed asparagus to up the nutritional value.  I also often decrease the butter with no change in flavor.  I have plopped in frozen uncooked shrimp at the end and it continues to turn out great every time.  I can also suggest using pre-marinated frozen shrimp for added flavor.

This was okay. The sauce was too bland so I added salt and pepper and a few dashes of garlic powder plus 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. The texture of the sauce became a little too thick but it helped to add some milk.

Very tasty!  We substituted light cream for most of the butter, and added some peas and chopped scallions.  My husband said it was "restaurant quality."  It would also be good with other ingredients like chicken, broccoli and red peppers.  We will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband and I truly enjoyed.  It is very flavorful and a little on the rich side.  Be sure to serve it with something light on the side.  I used the 2/3 cup water to cook the shrimp. I have also made it with chicken and it was equally as good.  It is a great sauce that can be adapted to just about anything.

So quick and delicious!  :-) I doubled the garlic and used pasta water like some reviewers suggested.  I also cooked my shrimp along with the mushrooms. I didn't have basil and parsley but used Italian herb seasoning, lemon pepper and bell peppers instead.  Really good!

I have made this recipe twice in the last week with a few minor tweaks.  I replaced water with reduced sodium chicken broth and used dried italian seasoning in place of basil( didn't have any).  This is very easy and delicious!  I served over zucchini noodles instead of pasta and it was great.

I rarely try online recipes. This is a simple recipe. Is a great base.  Feel free to add what everyou wish. First off i used about a pound and half of colossal shrimp. I sautéed onion, 1/2 orange habanero, and lots mushrooms. I placed this mixture in a bowl. I cooked the shrimp in the same pan.  I put them in same bowl with the mushroom mix. I put my garlic in the ninja chopper. Followed the remaining recipe but i used about 5 ounces of cream cheese. Mixture looked curdled. I started to worry. As soon as I added the boiled water everything came together wonerfully.  I did not have fresh basil, so I used cilantro from my garden,  and dry Italian  seasoning, and added a little salt.

I just tried this recipe for the first time tonight and I wasn't as impressed as I expected. I thought that the recipe called for too much butter, it drowns out other flavors from the garlic and basil.  I followed the instructions exactly but my sauce was a pool of butter. I wasn't too impressed, don't think I'll be trying again.

I don't care for the cream cheese sauce. Prefer alfredo. I wouldn't make this again.

Sooo good! Something my kids and husband will eat. I followed other recommendations, also doubled the shrimp and mushrooms, added a little wine and lemon juice because we like a little stronger flavor and everyone was pigging out in complete silence all through dinner!

The recipe as is is very bland. I altered the recipe and used white wine instead of water, milk and salt and pepper to taste.   This dish turned out to be restaraunt quality. Very tasty..it taste like you did a lot to make this meal but you didn't.  My family was very impressed.

This was awesome! I didn't have cream cheese, so I used sour cream. I also added the tops from asparagus, and a full pound of large cooked shrimp!
My husband said, "Better than Olive Garden!" YUMMO!

Not worth the fat calories. Sauce was too sticky and overpowered the shrimp flavor. I will stick to a traditional Alfredo with butter and cream. It wasn't a bad dish, just won't make it again.

Great recipe although a bit high fat.  I added some frozen sweet peas and heated through a few minutes before serving, both for color and to add more vegetables for my kids.  It was very nice. Also followed another reviewer's suggestion of using white wine instead of boiling water, adding freshly ground black pepper and grated parmesano reggiano at the table.  Restaurant quality recipe!  Thanks!

Technically family rated it at 4.5 stars!  Even 5 and 3 year old loved it.  Like other reviewers cut butter and did 8 oz. of cream cheese (low fat), and some splashes of skim milk, sauce was smooth, just the right consistency.  Added sweet orange and yellow peppers, fresh spinach, and green onions when sauteing the mushrooms.  Something we will make again at our house.

This was very good, I only used a very small piece of garlic as it doesn’t agree with my family and it still tasted great.  We also used spinach linguini instead of regular, great presentation!

This was delicious!  My hubby said I out-did myself, little did he know how easy this recipe was.  I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen shrimp and up'd the sauce ingredients a little, other than that, followed the recipe here.  This was a winner, will definitely make again!

This was really rich and bland at the same time.  It wasn't terrible but I won't be making it again.  I should note I read reviews before hand and did add one full package of cream cheese.  Maybe that was my mistake.  Anyhow, overall wasn't for us.

Absolutely LOVE this dish--as does everyone I have made it for.  I use penne pasta instead of linguini, and up the cream cheese to 8 oz as well as a full pound of shrimp.  Just as good as any pasta dish I have ever had at a restaurant---and SUPER easy to make!!!!

I will definitely try again, but will tweak it just a bit.  I wound up using the entire 8 oz block of cream cheese because after I added the water I felt it was way too thin.  Next time I think I'll use 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the water and take it from there.

Delicious! Skipped the sauted mushrooms. Made a few other changes to lower fat. Used 4oz of low fat(Neufchatel) cream cheese and 4 oz Smart Balance butter blend and substituted 1 cup fat free evaporated milk for the boiling water in the sauce. Increased garlic to 4 cloves. Added 2 tsp dried parsley, as I didn't have fresh. Increased shrimp to 1 pound. Served with steamed asparagus and garlic bread. My family loved it! Will make again soon!

FABULOUS!  I am an idiot in the kitchen - I fix computers, not cook!  But this was simple and easy, and I followed the advice of others and I added a whole brick of cream cheese and 1/4 cup more butter for more sauce, and more mushrooms. This was absolutely restaurant quality - amazing!

This dish was so easy and tasted delicious. We are on a budget and did not have the money for shrimp or mushrooms. We did have frozen chicken breast and  zuchinni allready. Instead of boiling water i used heated milk and marsalla wine I already had. It was so good. The whole family loved it. I cant wait to make it again with shrimp and mushrooms.

Just made this for lunch.  Quick and yummy!  Substituted mushrooms for fresh portobello mushrooms and added1/4 cup white wine and made up with water to 2/3 cup.  Definately will make again!

On my first try, I took a short cut and added cold water instead of boiling water - I almost gave the recipe a 3 star.  On the second try, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious!

Was very good!  Used chicken stock instead of water (having already drank all the wine),  and around 7-8oz cream cheese, sauteed onions with mushrooms then transfered to plate then sauteed a pound of shrimp with chipotle pepper powder and seasoning salt. Added a pound of steamed asparagus.  Next time will cut the pasta in half. Awesome recipe, thanks!

I have always had trouble with pasta recipes so I wasn't expecting perfection.  I was surprised to find that this dish came out pretty good!    I guess I was feeling bold today because I even made some changes.  I had a  14oz bag of frozen shrimp and, since I had to cook it, I melted the stick of butter and sauteed the thawed shrimp and spices together along with a few tablespoons of frozen Seasoning Blend (i.e onions, bell pepper, etc.).  I added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and Creole seasoning as well.  We are not big mushroom fans so I deleted them entirely.  After the shrimp was done, I added an 8 oz pkg of fat free cream cheese.  It melted just fine and I added about 1/2 a cup of 2% milk to thin it out before the simmer time.  Mixed the sauce with the pasta and there was plenty of sauce coverage.  Finished with a generous sprinkle of reduced fat Parmesan cheese.  Still very flavorful, rich, and cheesy.  Served with garlic bread.  Delish!  Had unexpected company over and the positive reviews were unanimous.  My pasta confidence is WAY up with this one!  Will definitely make this again!

This was so flexible and forgiving.  I didn't have any garlic, so I used garlic salt thinking it'd would probably turn out horrible.  Also, didn't have mushrooms so I added some boiled broccoli in when I tossed the shrimp and pasta together.  I eyeballed the cream cheese, but I'm guessing I used about 4 oz.  I will DEF. make this again.  My husband who doesn't really like pasta said it was really good and he hardly ever comments on anything I make.  He cleaned his plate!

This was okay after adding a little salt.  I was really disappointed.  The sauce was very thick.  I didn't add a little extra milk as one reviewer suggested.   Maybe that would have helped with the thickness.  Something all together different was needed to combat how bland this was.  Hubby said it might make an okay side dish to something more flavorful.

We really enjoyed this! BF gives 4.25 stars =) I used Borsin cheese instead of cream cheese because I needed to use it up - and I used fresh basil because I have it in my herb garden, and whole wheat pasta. The flavors blended really well together and made for a nice, relatively healthy dinner that came together easily!

This recipe was fantastic and quick - my whole family loved it. The only thing I did was add some cornstarch to the water to thicken the sauce slightly. I also added fresh thinly sliced zucchini. In the spring I will probably add asparagus!

Next time I will stick to the heavy cream to make the sauce.  The cream cheese is overly rich and the fat from it is overpowering.

Delicious! I wasn't sure at first how this was going to turn out. Once I put the cream cheese in, I started thinking "did I do something wrong?" because it didn't look right. But it smoothed out and was great in the end!

Fantastic, tasty, easy to make and a huge hit!! I made some heart healthy alterations to this recipe. I used reduced fat cream cheese and yogurt butter. I also added 2% milk to the cream cheese to unthicken the consistency. (it was too thick for me) I like my consistency to me more like a sauce, not like a paste. The mushrooms add a punch to this recipe that give this a TKO!! YUMMY!!! I served it with grilled asparagus and rosemary bread. Two thumbs up!!

So-so.... used low fat cream cheese that ruined the texture and flavour.  Also, should consider grilling the shrimp first to infuse flavour and crisy texture.  Will not make this again2

I made this with chicken breast and mushrooms. I did saute some onion with the mushrooms in the initial step, which gave it a nice flavor. Followed the advice of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water. Also used a dash of white pepper.

Delicious and so easy!  My husband, who does not really like white sauces or cheese sauces, thought this was really good! I like how you can easily make it vegetarian by taking out the meat and adding artichokes or zucchini.  Yumm!!  I made this with fresh basil and it was great.  this is a keeper!

OMG! I had some shrimp and mushrooms and typed it in google and this resipe came up. It was SOOO GOOD. I did alter it by reading some of your reviews about adding a little milk but I ate this for dinner a couple of nights and lunch one day. It was that good! I had to come on and rate it I loved it that much. I'm going to try it with chicken next time.

We loved this recipe!  Made it exactly according to directions although we might add more basil, garlic and parsley next time and reduce the water moderately just because we like a little thicker and stronger sauce.  The recipe just as it is absolutely delicious . . . as good as if not better than my favorite pasta dish at Olive Garden!  And I'm NOT the greatest cook!

OMG...this recipe was awesome! I made this recipe on New Year's for my DH. He ate two servings. I made only one slight change...I added fontina cheese. Delicious. The cream sauce was so smooth and creamy you could sop it up with garlic bread. Thank you so much. This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great recipe.  I put chicken and cut up asparagus in it instead of shrimp.  My husband said it tasted like a dish he had at the Olive Garden one time.  So that's good!  Everyone on here is right.  The sauce is WAY too thick.  I added at least 1-1/2 cups of the pasta water to thin it and it was still pretty thick.  My husband said it would be even better with some of the cut up generic Mexican block cheese he loves so much.  It's like Velveeta but it's a white block of cheese with peppers in it.

Terrific, flavorful and easy. Added pepper and will use less boiling water next time.

So Yummy, taste like something you could order from red lobster...I added crab meat, more basil and parsley and some pepper, along with a little bit of milk and less boiling water...didn't use mushrooms since i am not a fan...very good will make again!

Awesome dish! Definitely something to serve guests. VERY rich. I had it over spaghetti squash "noodles" and my husband had his with linguini. Only change I made was to use fresh shrimp which I cooked with the mushrooms. Don't count on leftovers!

I just prepared this and it was so delicious my husband declared it definitely a "keeper."  Then I went back and re-read the recipe before I filed it.  I made it with 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of 3 ounces!  No wonder it was so rich and creamy.  My bad sure turned out good!

This is a good starting point, but the recipe definitely needs more.  It has very little flavor.  I may use this recipe again, but I will be adding more spices to liven it up.

Great! I did a shrimp scampi first, set aside with the mushrooms, which was cooked & simmered with white wine. I used 8oz cream cheese and added milk & white wine to the sauce so it isn't so thick. All in all, an easy quick recipe!!!!

This was really good. I took advice of others who used chive cream cheese, but I used 8oz of regular cream cheese and added fresh chives which added a LOT of flavor. I also added extra garlic because I love garlic. It was very quick (done in about 20 minutes) and easy to make. Leftovers heat up great as well.

I added onions, sweet red peppers, and broccoli flowerettes while cooking the mushrooms - added the shrimp when the veggies were almost done.  I substituted oregano for basil, because we prefer it.  I prepared the sauce in a separate pan, so that I could prepare the sauce while the veggies cooked.  I used whole wheat rotini.  Drained the noodles, put them back in the pot, added veggies and shrimp, then poured the sauce on topped and tossed and added a sprinkle of parmesean cheese to the top. My family enjoyed this meal and raved about my ability to produce a gourmet dish.  It was good the 2nd day too.

I made this for my boyfriend last night and he LOVED it. I did make some changes. I added a full pound of raw shrimp that I cooked with the mushrooms. I also used Greek Seasoning on the shrimp and in the sauce to give it more flavor. When I put the mushrooms and shrimp into the sauce I also added a fresh diced tomato. Served it with some fresh bread and some white wine. I'll definitely make this again but will continue to modify the recipe until it is perfect.

Good recipe, but needs salt and lots of black pepper.  I would also consider adding wilted spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and capers if I ever make it again.

Very yummy & very rich.  I added a little mike to it until I got the consistency I wanted, and I used white wine instead of the boiling water.  I hinestly think the wine gave it most of the delicious flavour!

I would have given this 5 stars easily but I modified a bit..I used whole wheat pasta, low-fat cream cheese, doubled the mushrooms and garlic (love garlic!!) and added some broccoli, plus I omited the water altogether and used white wine. I also eye balled the butter and def. used way less that what was called for. I did double the sauce recipe as well. But this was a great base recipe and make it your own by changing it to suit your needs. Solid 4 stars!!!

Sorry, but I was hoping it would be worth the reviews but it just wasn't very good. I thought the sauce looked thin but it did thicked up nice on the pasta. However, out of the 4 of us nobody cared for it.

YUMMY!

This dish was fabulous. My tummy thanks you while my love handles don't. 

I did use low fat earth balance vegan butter and low fat cream cheese to TRY and cut the fat content a bit... Although I did use about 6 1/2 ounces of cream cheese instead of 3 so I'm not sure what good my attempt at calorie cutting did... but still absolutely FANTASTIC. 

Next time I'll use whole wheat linguine and try non fat cream cheese. 

Thanks! :]

This was wonderful! I changed/added a few things as others suggested.  I used white wine and heavy cream intead of water and I also used 8oz cream cheese instead of 3oz.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes, with added some color to the dish.  It came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent---this dish was quite tasty.  I followed the recipe with a few minor additions.  I used gulf shrimp which I lightly seasoned with Basil, Pepper and a dash of Old Bay before cooking them in a tablespoon of olive oil. I also added a few dashes of Cayenne Pepper and salt to the sauce.  It was a masterpiece that my husband raved about.

Really really good! I did the wine/milk mix instead of the boiling water like everyone else said, and it was great.
I was a bit concerned after adding the cream cheese because it was kinda chunky but it smoothed out! I added grape tomoatoes sliced in half when i added the mushrooms and shrimp to the sauce. That gave it a bit more colour and a great taste. 
I highly reccomend this recipe

This recipe needed a little tweaking for our taste, so I changed it up a little... Marinated raw shrimp with the "Grilled Marinated Shrimp" recipe from this site, then cooked it and set aside to add to the pasta instead of using plain cooked shrimp. For the pasta sauce, I reduced the butter by half, used milk instead of water, and added some other seasonings for more flavor. I also added asparagus, which I simply cooked at the same time as the mushrooms in the pan with some butter. The end result was excellent!!

This was fantastic!  I used an 8 oz package of cream cheese, and substituted white wine for half of the boiling water, as recommended.  It came out amazing!  My 9 year old even ate the mushrooms!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This came out very good! I admit I was a little worried when I added the cream cheese to the butter, and it got all foamy and just plain weird looking, but as soon as I added the boiling water, it smoothed out instantly. I cooked the pasta until it was just about done, then finished it in the pan with the sauce. If I didn't know there was cream cheese in this, I would have never guessed. It was just a nice, creamy sauce. Thanks for the recipe, I never would have thought of this!

Delicious! Quick and easy, too.  Since I'm afraid this would be too heavy/creamy for my taste, I scaled down on the cream cheese (used only half of what the recipe called for), added white wine, sun dried tomatoes and a pinch of kosher salt. Perfecto!  Will make this again.

As others have said, this recipe was great and easy. I too used milk instead of water and added some parmesan cheese to the sauce at the end. I tried to lighten the fat content a litle by using low-fat butter and cream cheese, and used 3/4 lb of shrimp. The only prob was that once I added the milk, I kept waiting and waiting for it to thicken up (was very watery). So I think I ended up over-cooking it a tad, cuz as soon as I added the pasta and removed it ftom the heat, it was SUPER thick, almost too thick. We still enjoyed it though and will make again, just not too often b/c of the nutrition value. Oh-yeah, used spinach fettucine, too. Made it look more elegant.

This could be a 5-star recipe.  It was very good, but I really wish I'd taken more of the reviewers' suggestions before trying it (though then it isn't fair to the submitter, if things don't work out well).  Next time, I'll definitely increase the garlic and use a combination of milk and white wine instead of the water, and will probably reduce the total liquid to about 2/3 of what the recipe recommends.  Still a great dish...thanks for submitting!

Love this for a quick and light summer meal.  I used dried parsley and basil, and substituted mushrooms for peas.  My family loved it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but it was probably more like 4 1/2. Everyone in the family absolutely loved it. I did add onions to the mushroom saute, and that added a little more flavor. Next time I will add some red peppers or maybe some diced tomatoes just to give it a little something extra. I will definitely be making it again soon!

This was amazing and so Deliicous! Instead of water I used heavy whipping cream made the sauce more thick and creamier.

This is an excellent recipe!  As per other comments we made it with skim milk instead of water.  And instead of with shrimp we served it with chicken cordon bleu.

This is very good and not a difficult dish to prepare. My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much! To lower the fat content a bit, I used a lighter version of cream cheese. I also added chicken stock instead of the water.  
Thank you for a good but simple recipe.

Very good. Reminds me of the shrimp linguini at our favorite Italian place. The only thing I will change next time is the amount of butter. I'm going to cut that in half, I think. That much butter kind of left an oily taste in my mouth.

Excellent! I've been trying to replicate a creamy to-die-for clam/mushroom sauce served at a restaurant.  This is the closest I've come. I used clams (chopped; canned) instead of shrimp, sauteed with the mushrooms, and clam liquid for the water.  I also used two ounces butter and five ounces cream cheese.

Oh my goodness!  SO yummy.  I added another clove of garlic and some fresh spinach.  I used dried herbs and it worked out fine.  My boyfriend said that this was restaraunt quality.  Will for sure make over and over again.  Pretty enough to serve to company!  Thanks for this wonderful post, best I've made from this site yet!

This was THE best pasta I have ever made! It was extremely easy to make, I used dried herbs and it turned out perfect. I love Angel hair pasta so I used it, and it gave it a wonderful  texture. Great recipe for all occasions!

Super tasty, even after making the mistake of buying crabs instead of shrimps! (Can't read the labels here in Prague.) I love seafood but my boyfriend is not the biggest fan so I was looking for a complex recipe to make that wouldn't taste so 'fishy'. This was an excellent find. I used a roze wine to thin the sauce instead of water and served it on spinach linguine. The fresh herbs are such a nice addition. Perhaps a bit too much mushroom, but it worked for us. Boyfriend ate all of his share happily and said that he would love the sauce on pasta without the seafood, so now I have a great creamy mushroom sauce recipe too. :) By the way, made what the recipe suggests to be 4 portions and it was just enough for the 2 of us as a main dish.

I'm sorry to say but I did not find this meal to be as wonderful as some of the other users.  I did try to make the sauce a little less thick by using skim milk but in the end it just didn't matter. My family did not like this at all and I will not be making this again.

I doubled everything but mushrooms.No basil at all, used only 4 T. butter total and allot of chicken broth, light cream cheese, and it was still awfully rich. Hubby liked, but since I cook and decide dinners, I won't make it again.

This recipe is great!  I made this last night.  I didn't use all the butter it called for, but cooked the mushrooms in white wine and instead of cream cheese, I substituted Boursin garlic & herb cheese.  Needed to add some pasta water at the end because mixture was thick. Fantastic.  Will definately make again.

Very tasty.  We liked this one very much.  Only problem noticed was the linguine and sauce dried out a bit, but I think that was my doing and will correct it for next time.  I sauteed 2 cans of sliced mushrooms instead of fresh ones.  I also used 5 garlic cloves and a full 8oz brick of cream cheese and used a whisk to stir it which really helped.  I used only 1/4 cup of water and added 1/4 cup white wine.  I used the salad size shrimp and added a dose of parmesan cheese and a bit of extra garlic powder.  End result- YUMMY!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This tastes exactly like my husband's favorite dish at our local Creole style resturant!  I just served it to him for his birthday and the first thing out of his mouth was "FISHBONE'S!"  I doubled the garlic, used 5 oz. of cream cheese, used lots of shrimp and mushrooms and added a bunch of asparagus.  I also used milk instead of water.  It was rich, but very delicious!  Oh- and sooooo easy!  It took longer to boil the pasta than make the sauce!  THANK YOU!

I modified it with low fact cream cheese, a lot less butter, More shrimp and mushrooms ( tossed in some leftover chicken too) than added in some veggies to try and get those in the daily 4-6 stuff.. I tossed in broccoli and  snow peas , but really you can toss in anything.  because I added in more stuff, I took a reviewers advice and doubled up on cream cheese and a bit of milk for more sauce.  I think next time I will add a bit of jar pesto sauce at the end  as well.

It was a little bland without the real cream cheese richness, so I added more garlic and pepper, and some shredded parmesan.  Kids gobbled it down though.

We use wheat pasta 'cause it is healthier and more filling.  bit more expensive though a little bit goes a long way. Kids do not notice the difference.

Really Delicious!!!
Next time I will make it with clams and then after that maybe some crab meat. Very easy to make. Impress your in-laws, the boss, or be like me and just eat it all yourself ;-)

Very flavorful. I substituted the shrimp with scallops and sauteed the scallops with the mushrooms, so it created a wonderful sauce.  It was a bit heavy, I would cut back on the butter next time.

I added some chopped green onions, and as other reviewers suggested, used 8 oz cream cheese, and used milk in place of water.  Easy to make, and tastes fantastic.

This was an EXCELLENT meal!  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cut a little of the butter out, added 1/2 a chopped onion and 4 extra cloves of garlic.  I also substituted skim milk for the water & didn't use the full amt.  I also used fat-free cream cheese.  My hubby & I loved it & will definitely fix it again!

My husband said this was the BEST shrimp recipe ever!!!! Even better than his favorite which is Scampi. We ate it all up in record time!!
Changes I made: I followed previous advice and used milk and water instead of just water.  I used about 5 cloves minced garlic, 1 pound of shrimp, and 6 oz cream cheese.  I also used pre-sliced mushrooms in a jar.
I sauteed the garlic and mushrooms first, followed by the shrimp, parsley and basil.  Then I aded the cream cheese followed by the water and milk.  
Turned out perfectly creamy and delicious.
I also spiced it up with Cayenne pepper b/c we like EVERYTHING spicy.
Thank you Karyn for an delicious yet very easy recipe!!!

I cooked this for my family but I changed the Linguini to Angel Hair Pasta, used a 1/2 tsp. of basil and substituted the water for milk. I also added one meduim chopped onion(sauteed). My family thought it was GREAT! My son-in-law even said it tastes better than what you can get in the resturants! Very Good!

I thought I was going to have to throw this away after I saw what the sauce looked like, but it was better when I added milk to it. I also used chiken in it.  I used a lot of basil because the lid fell off.. but it was suprisingly good! :-)

EXCELLENT!!  Be sure to try this one; you won't be disappointed.  Definitely restaurant quality and one that will impress your guests.  I had a dish in a nearby restaurant that is very similar that had shrimp, lobster, scallops, artichokes and black olives.  I duplicated these ingredients and it was even better than the one I had in the restaurant. I cut back on the butter, but it didn't affect the sauce. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.
Thanks Karyn for a great recipe!

Based on the reviews I thought that I would really love this recipe.  I love rich, creamy sauces and shrimp.  I really wasn't that impressed.  It was good, but I've had better.  Needs more garlic and salt.

Very Good. I made a couple of changes. I doubled the cream cheese, lessened the water a little, added red onion chopped, red pepper, mushrooms, saute'd in olive oil. I did the recipe 1/2 of the butter and other 1/2 olive oil. Also added more shrimp, and salt and pepper......was excellent!!

This recipe was pretty good.  I made some modifications to my own personal taste.  As others have said, it lacked flavor.  I used 8oz cream cheese and added a 1/4 cup of milk because I like thick sauces.  I also added some salt, a little garlic powder, pepper and used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3.  I will definately make this again, as it was rather quick and simple.  THANKS!

This was a pretty good dish, but the recipe needed some tweaking.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh cause I did not have fresh on hand.  I also used 1 lb. of shrimp cause the 1/2 lb. is not enough to feed four, IMHO.  Then I made everything as specified, but the sauce was bland.  So I added about 1 tsp of salt.  Also, I would prefer a thicker sauce, so next time I'll probably use less water.  Overall, this was about a restaurant quality pasta that I will make again.  Thanks!

I made these with chicken bits. This was good, but not that great. The sauce turned out too thick that I had to add milk to the mixture. Also I had to add seasoned salt to make it taste less bland. Next time I will try cream cheese with chives and some seafood.

Fairly easy to make.  I recommend using more pasta to dilute the mixture.  I also added more seafood (scallops).

Great recipe!  We left out the mushrooms, not being mushroom fans and added the juice of a lemon to lighten it up a bit.  Probably not necessary.  This seems like a great, lower calorie, replacement for an alfredo.

This was a very easy and yummy dish. It lacked a punch though. Maybe a little lemon juice? My one year old LOVED it. Over all it was a really good recipe. I would definitely make it again.

I couldn't bring myself to use so much butter for this recipe so I cut it in half.  I substituted with skim milk and used low fat cream cheese.  The taste was still fabulous and everyone really enjoyed it.  I think next time I'll also add some bell peppers and perhaps even less butter.  The cream cheese and herbs do most of the flavouring.  

Great recipe.

I made this recipe without substitution
because shrimp and mushrooms are two of
my favorite foods, but I could't predict how 
much my son would love it! Now I make it
for all the important events, including
family reunions. My son says this is one
of the foods he comes home for!
Can substitute tofu for the cream cheese.

I agree with the lady who said it was rich. But it had a great flavor.One of my grandchildren loved it the other one hated it, but I have the deciding vote and we will have it again.It's fast and easy. I will double the sauce tho because   I didn't think there was enough to coat the pasta. Give it a try! dc14

I loved this recipe. I didn’t add all the water but I doubled the recipe and added a little milk and water. If you think it’s bland add more seasoning. This is a great recipe.

I doubled the recipe for 1 lb. of fettuccine.  I really liked this, but my MIL and wife like soupy and runny sauces and thought this was thick.

This recipe was as simple as it was delicious. It was a nice cheesy meal that delighted the whole family. I actually added some mozzarella cheese to make it creamier and gooier and it was perfect!

I made this, was quick and easy.  I didn’t remove the mushrooms as suggested.  Used the hot water from the noodles.  Next time I make this I would add some onions with mushrooms.  Very tasty, good and easy!  Thanks

I added more shrimp and a whole block of cream cheese.  When I make it again I will most likely skip the water and add a T. of wine.

I did make  a number of changes.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and replaced the water with a 1/4 cup milk and a 1/4 cup wine.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of finely chopped celery.  It tasted awesome! I also didn't have enough mushrooms. When I make it again, I'll add more mushrooms because they were delicious, though somewhat sparse.

I made this tonight for dinner with the following changes.  I used more shrimp, sauteeing them with the mushrooms.  Used double the garlic and double the cream cheese.  Used milk rather than water and added some lovely sweet peas.  (I like to have a little green in everything.)  I also finished it off with some parm.  At any rate, it was lovely...a true 5 star dish.  Thank you so much.

I did not add enough hot water to the sauce. Therefore it thickened way too quickly at the dinner table. Next time I will thin the sauce  quite a bit more. I had the leftovers 3 days later! Heated in a double boiler and added a bit more water to thin things out.
Delish!

Awesome!  I made a few substitutions to make it more diet friendly and it was absolutely amazing! 
Zoodles instead of linquini, only used 4 tbs butter total, Neufchâtel cheese  instead of cream cheese, and a bit of dry white wine for flavor.  It was outstanding!

I've made this several times, it always tastes great.  Creamy sauce.  The only thing that I changed was to use more mushrooms and I topped each plate with chopped green onion.

My family really loved this recipe.  I made it based on the feedback that recommended using 8oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cp of milk, and 1/2 cp of white wine.  Definitely will make it again.

Love that I only needed one skillet! Made it pretty much as recipe said, with the few things others said to try: splash of white wine, a little milk and 8 oz of cream cheese.  Very rich, very yummy! Husband went for seconds, so, that means I will be making it again! I agree that it would also be good with chicken!!!Thanks for an easy "go to" recipe!!

Very good.  I add a full block of cream cheese and only a little extra water.  The flavor was very bland with only half block of cream cheese and the said amount of water.  Next time I will NOT mix in the shrimp, mushrooms and garlic into the sauce and rather spoon the mixture  over the zucchini noodles / pasta and then top with the sauce.

This is really good!  Followed another reviewer recommendation to saute mushrooms, garlic and herbs in 2 Tbsp butter,  then add cream cheese.   Combine 1.5 cups milk with two Tbsp corn starch and heat until thickened.  It was delicious!  Served with a green salad and it was a nice meal for 3 adults.

This was a tasty dish. Easy to put together  and delicious to eat. I did love the cream cheese sauce over the pasta,  mushrooms and shrimp. I didn't have any dried basil, but it tasted fine without it. I would make this again.

I tried making it a little "healthier" by using less butter. Probably 1/4 cup over all instead of a few tbsp + 1/2 cup in the actual recipe... also used fat free cream cheese. I'm sure it would have been better if I truly followed the recipe, but it turned out pretty good anyway. Oh, I added some grated parmesan cheese to try and fill in for some of the fat I took out.

I only give it 4 stars not because tasted fantabulous, it was a bit dry.  The recipe does not make enough sauce.  Other than that, and a few onions,  it is perfection!  So many flavors.  Super Yummy

After reading other postings I cooked the mushrooms with the shrimp and added 2 heaping Tbs of minced garlic ( I love garlic). Used a little bit more cream cheese (5 oz) and instead of water I used beef broth.  I added more fresh parsley and basil because I had it growing outside my window this summer and thought “Yes I should add more!”  My family devoured it and I will make this again.

This was amazing! I did substitute white wine for the water and used 8 oz of cream cheese. My husband said it was better than meals we've had at our local Italian restaurant.

Yum Yum Yummy!  I added more garlic cause we like enough to ware off vampires!  :)   This really is restaurant quality.  I used fresh peel shrimp form HEn to save time and weight watchers cream cheese to lighten it up a bit.  Total time is how long does it take to cook the noodles.  I also used white wine and pasta water to Dilute as other said it gets thick.   -PERFECT RECIPE- Thank you!  I Served w salad and crusty bread!

This recipe is awesome! The change I made was instead of 2/3 cup of boiling water, I added 2/3 cup of heavy cream. I also added johnny's seasoning salt and probably more garlic than called for.
My husband says that the cream cheese was good but a little much, but I think it was amazing!

the only change I made is I used noodles instead of linguine.   It actually is really good, even the kids liked it. The recipie doesnt mention it but the sauce is thin at first but then thickens after it sits a few minutes.

I cut back on the amount of mushrooms to a 1/4 pound, added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and used a thin spaghetti noodle. 
It is a great tasting meal and we (me and husband) didn't leave leftovers...

I am no means a chef, but was able to follow this recipe. I thought it was pretty darn good, but I wouldn't say it was so amazing 5 stars! I do however agree that you shouldn't use that much water. I used pretty much no water and had this nice thick taste. Wasn't runny at all.

Would definitely make it again, as it was easy to make

Will need to try again as it was only fine. Not outstanding. Did substitute some white wine for water. Needs less pasta more mushrooms or other veg.

this was really good, but I changed a few things based on what i had.  i used penne pasta, added a little of both red and green peppers to the mushrooms,  doubled the garlic, subbed the boiling water for 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk, and added some grated parmesan and fresh ground pepper at the end. my boyfriend and I both loved it and will definitely make it again, very tasty and easy.

I like to try recipes as written and then the next time if needed make any modifications. For this one I sauteed the shrimp in butter and 1 clove of garlic and sprinkled in some Old Bay for additional seasoning instead of pepper. I then added the mushrooms. Set aside. Instead of water I used white wine with fresh basil and parsley along with another clove of minced garlic with the cream cheese.  It was a hit at the dinner table.

i rarely follow a recipe but use it as a creative jump start...i always rate the recipe for it's ability to inspire, for i feel it's important to attribute the poster's contribution.  attribution being vital, as well as completely appreciated.  so this is a rare exception in that i followed it  fairly closely.

i followed the order & my changes were the addition of ingredients:  all were organic, the prawns were wild argentine as they are the pretty much free of fuku contamination.  i added a bulb, large, of garlic, red pepper, red pepper flakes, spanish paprika, blk pepper, lemon pepper, artichoke hearts, fresh basil, shiitake mushrooms as well as a mixture of others, whipping cream, a dash of pinot gris.  i used less butter but combined evoo with the butter when possible.  the noodles were italian duram organic.  topped it with wonderful parmesan & more fresh basil.  i try to use iodine salt for thyroid protection, 'kosher' (if tibetan rock salt is kosher?) salt does not include iodine.   

it was great, thank you so much for submitting it.  i served it with strawberry avocado cuke spinach red pepper salad. 

it was a fabulous late lunch & felt very european.  there are online several other sites listing this recipe, exactly the same.  perhaps the submitter follows various sites.  either way it's a winner winner. & i thank you very much.

It's 5 stars with a couple simple modifications. If you follow the recipe and want to use hot water, reserve aside a portion of the pasta water. However, this dish is creamier if you use milk. I used whole milk because that's all I had on hand. I added about 1/4c - 1/2c shredded parmesan cheese prior to serving. It thickened the pasta sauce up a bit. Also, I added cut pieces of asparagus spears in with the mushrooms (the dish needs a green veggie). Additionally, I added minced garlic and garlic powder to the mushroom/asparagus mixture. I also used way more parsley, probably close to 1/2c of fresh chopped parsley and garlic powder also to the sauce. With these simple mods, the dish became richer and my toddler gobbled up two servings. We doubled the recipe, perfect for next day leftovers. Add a little fresh cracked pepper too and voila! Perfection! I will definitely make this dish again. I hope this helps a bit! Cheers.

Delicious.  I followed some of the other suggestions and used fat free milk in place of water, added extra fresh parsley and used a full 8 oz. of low fat cream cheese.  Will be making this again, the kids loved it too.

Made it with some additions!   Added spinach & cherry tomatoes.  Also, thinned it out using white cooking wine!  Will definitely make again after I burn the cream cheese & pasta calories.

I know, not exactly low fat, so substitute low fat cream cheese if you must, but the amount of butter is correct. And for the love of all that is holy, do NOT substitute margarine. You need the milk fats.

I did make a few changes. I used frozen, shell-on shrimp. While I was starting the mushrooms, I was also simmering the shells to make a quick shrimp stock (add a little salt and pepper). That stock I used in place of the water, because that seemed boring to me, but I knew with all the cream cheese and the butter, milk would be overkill. It would also sweeten the sauce and I didn't want that.

I cooked the shrimp with the mushrooms. It only takes about 4 minutes anyway, which is about the time the mushrooms need. Moved both mushrooms and shrimp to a plate and continued the recipe as stated.

I didn't have fresh basil (forgot to get some) but about a tsp of dry worked well enough for our purposes, though I really wish I'd had fresh. The secret here is real ingredients, as fresh as you can manage (thus the frozen shrimp and the quick stock).

Finally, I only used half the pasta. I wanted my sauce to actually come through, and using the whole package seemed like a bit too much. (But then I was only serving 2 anyway; you might want to consider making half again the amount of sauce for a whole pound of pasta. Doubling it is probably too much though.)

We WILL make this again. (P.S. DO whisk the sauce as you make it, the cheese will break up more easily. Also, I'd softened it in t

I've made this twice. The first time I made true to recipe and it was delicious. The second time I made it I added a scallion to cook with the mushroom and it added a lot of flavor.  Have recommended this recipe to a friend of mine that relatively new to cooking.

I used some of the pasta water for the recipe and it added a little starch which thickened the sauce perfectly!

I used twice as much garlic as the recipe called for but since it was sauteed the meal still did not have the garlic flavor. Next time I'll add some fresh garlic at the end to make sure the flavor is there. 

I added fresh parsley on top when I served it since I had cut too much.  I do not recommend that. The texture of the fresh parsley did not blend well with the meal.

Just lovely!  Made this for a late summer dinner. I halved the recipe, as there are only two of us. I also substituted milk for the water & decreased the amount based on the other reviews of this recipe.  I will totally be making this delightful  & easy dish again!

Delicious and easy recipe. Next time I will not use as much butter and make sure pasta is hotter before adding since sauce cools fairly quick.

Was fabulous.  I actually marinated the shrimp in a lemon pepper marinade and grilled them along with asparagus.  I sautéed the mushrooms with green onions.  I  also added a 1/4 cup of white wine and some red pepper flakes.  thank you for sharing!

This was my first time to cook shrimp, so I was a little nervous. I followed the recipe exactly, and it must have been a big hit because hubby and daughter were raving and chewing. Son- in-law called the next day to see if there were any leftovers. Simple and delicious. Excellent way to use our Gulf Coast shrimp.

Excellent basis for a recipe.  I made the following additions: added sliced black olives at the end.  I also stir fried twice the amount of mushrooms, plus green bell pepper, yellow onion, and red frezno pepper.  Finally, to reduce the fat I used non-stick coating spray to stir fry the veggies, and used 3 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup of 2% milk.  I did not use water.  It came out great!!!

Absolutely amazing recipe.!  Did it a little different in steps. Added creole seasoning when i boiled the shrimp. Used that same water to boil pasta. Added onion and garlic to the mushrooms while cooking.. And used the same water w creole seasoning for allllll the boiling.! Parmesan at the end and it was AMAZING.!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this for the first time yesterday. My mother doesn't really care for pasta, she did eat a bite.  The great news is I have leftovers.
No linguini on hand, used angel hair pasta. To give the herb sauce an extra kick of flavor, I used a can of veggie broth instead of water and brought it to a near boil, then added cream cheese. I also added 1/4 cup of white wine. My next time I may use a bit more cheese (romano or parmesean). And there will be a next time.

Added cilantro because I didn't have dried basil, and chicken instead of shrimp. I added other sorts of mushroom which enhanced the texture. Would redo recipe again because sauce was easy to make, and ingredients are always in pantry.

I made it with 8 oz cream cheese as some said in reviews and it wasn't my favorite. It was good but could have used some other flavoring. I do appreciate its easy recipe. It was quick and I had most things on hand.

VERY rich - perhaps too heavy; just be ready. Make a little sauce, perhaps increase the sauce by 1/4. Also, needs something to give it more kick... Make sure to use freshest herbs or it tastes flat.  I WILL make it again and I'll make it better!

I was looking for a shrimp and pasta recipe. This was the only one that I had all the ingredients needed on hand. Everyone ate it but it wasn't anything special. Probably won't be making it again.

This is a winner from my husband and son. I use heavy whipped cream instead of cream cheese and water.  I also tried this again with mushrooms only.

Turned out very badly for me. I stuck to the recipe with just the suggestion from others of replacing the water with a bit of white wine. The flavors never melded. It just tasted like each separate ingredient. And the sauce broke.

We loved it!!! The only difference I added to it was to add about a teaspoon and a half of Cajun seasoning. Even my 1 year old had two full bowls. Easy to make with ingredients we already had in the house.

really good. this is in the dinner rotation every month.  the only difference in my preparation is that i add the minced garlic and a little evoo and salt and pepper to the mushrooms, so that they soak up all of that flavor and also helps flavor the pan when you add the cheese.  i also use the starchy pasta water to smooth out the sauce.

Definitely needs salt (but you can do that as you plate). I didn't have fresh cooked shrimp, I had frozen, so I just boiled those for 2 minutes (before using later). Worked perfectly.

I didn't have cream cheese so used milk for the sauce and a small amount of grated cheese. The result was a smooth sauce, not as rich but thick enough and delicious.
This will become one of my go-to meals. I served it with a simple salad and warm  baguette.

Great recipe! I did make some changes. I used my pasta water instead of boiling water. Also added asparagus to my mushrooms, Parmesan to the to sauce before tossing with my pasta. Definitely a keeper!

This was simple to make and tasted great!  I made some adjustments- sauteed garlic with mushrooms & raw shrimp.  Followed remaining as written with a dash of black pepper & Parmesan and gradually added pasta water to consistency I wanted.  Tossed pasta in sauce and dinner was served.   Will be serving this dish again !!

Great recipe for when you want to have a cheat meal, but a few changes can be made to make it even better. Add some white wine, capers and even a little bit of artichokes for extra flavour!

Perfect combination of sweet, fat, salt. Only missing crunch, I added 1/4 cup sliced almonds, increased the shrimp, and sprinkled with bacon bits  also fresh pasta.

terrific!  I made it as instructed with one addition....magic mushroom powder fro the book Nom Nom...sensational!
Also I find it so much better to use fresh herbs where possible, basil and parsley.
thanks for sharing!

Delicious!!! My husband and parents loved it.  I got scared when the cream cheese wasn't melting and blending nicely but the water helps. Once you add the shrimp and mushrooms it becomes perfect.  Better than most Italian restaurants I've been too!  At the end I drizzled some truffle oil and sea salt.  Perfect touch

I cant believe i forgot to rate this recipe! I made it last month and it was an absolute treat! Everybody loved it including my picky eaters, (my daughter and mother-in-law). I used slice portobellas since those are my favorite. I agree with others that this tasted restaurant quality. Fresh herbs made it extra flavorful.

Absolutely wonderful and easy to make.  My husband made this using light cream cheese and some pasta water but if uyou used white wine it would be equally as tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe!! I didn't use all the butter that was called for. I probably used a couple of tablespoons and a little bit of olive oil. I also used lite cream cheese to cut down on the calories and fat grams. 

I used Chanterelle mushrooms instead of the button or baby bellas that I would normally use. After the mushrooms were cooked, I sautéed a thinly sliced onion. I also added ¾ cup frozen peas that had been thawed. Add these at the end so the peas don’t become mushy. They only need to be heated up.

Instead of the dried basil, I added a couple of squirts of the Basil in a Tube – the amount probably adds up to about 1 ½ inches if you would measure it out.
 
I used a little bit of chicken broth in the sauce as well as the water. It just needed a little liquid to loosen the sauce up and chicken broth made it really good. This is an amazing dish and I would give it 10 stars if I could!

Next time I am going to add a few crumbles of goat cheese in with the cream cheese as it melts into a sauce. I think that would be fantastic.

This was a VERY good recipe!!  The next time I make it, I will have to triple the recipe so that there will be enough for all of my family (4 including me) to have enough.  I made this for the time one day last week.  I made according to directions and realized that there would not be enough for 4 people. The original receipe was enough for 2 people to have 2 servings. I doubled the recipe to the best of my ability (with what I had on hand) and was enough for us to have a 2nd portion; however, my family wanted even more so this is why I will have to triple the recipe lol

Gift from the Gods?  I don't think so.  I followed the instructions exactly and just felt the dish was a bit bland.  It needed more seasoning to make it taste like more than just a big mix of dairy sauce.

What a great meal. I followed the recipe and it was terrific! My whole family, including my picky kids, loved it. Best of all it was simple to make after working all day. If you like pasta, shrimp, mushroom and cream cheese.... This is it!! Thanks for sharing this one!

We made this with a little over a pound of shrimp and 4 ounces of cream cheese and it was a big hit. Even the 2 finicky eaters asked for seconds and thirds.  Will definitely make it often.

I tweaked this recipe by adding milk to the whole 12 ounces of cream cheese, (mo' is 'betta), added scallops, and lemon pepper. In my pasta, I tossed it with olive oil and salt, then put it in the sauce with shredded Parmesan cheese. I received rave reviews!

This was very good.  I followed the suggestions of others and made the following changes:  Added an onion and sauteed it with the mushrooms.  Cut the butter down to 1/4 cup in the sauce.  Doubled the garlic.  Doubled the cream cheese.  Used fresh basil about 1/4 cup.   Used 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup parmesan in the sauce..and then just added pasta water until the sauce was the consistency I wanted.  I felt the pasta needed salt.  I have never salted pasta on the table but I had to this time......

I followed this recipe exactly practicing a meal that I'd like to make for my mom's birthday when she comes to visit. It was good, but fairly bland. I made about twice the amount of sauce w/ shrimp, and still felt it lacked seasoning. The idea is there, but it needs more--not sure what to add.

This was amazing! I didnt have linguini so i used penne. I think i prefered it to long noodles. I added spinach and used fresh basil and parsley per another review.  I also used cream and added white wine in place of the water and milk. Simply delicious!

UNBELIEVABLY delicious and easy!!! I used all lower fat contents and it was still amazing!  I used extra garlic when I sautéed the mushrooms, shortly after added the shrimp with white white. Removed all that and then made the sauce. In that I used less butter, reduced fat cream cheese, almond milk, white wine along with the herbs and other ingredients. I whisked that smooth. It came too thick but I'll add equal parts liquid from the pasta and almond milk. Yummy!!!!

I knew I wanted to have shrimp for dinner but had no idea what to do.  I always refer to all recipes for last minute ideas.  I came across this recipe with I ngredient search: shrimp and cream cheese. After reading a few reviews, Getting the sauce right is what matters most.  I used shrimp and red bell peppers since I didn't have mushrooms on hand.  My husband, 8 and 11 y.o. kids, and I LOVED it!! Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night- and kept to the recipe without making any changes.  I like to try recipes as they are written and then will usually change things up the second time I make it.

Bland, bland, bland.   No depth of flavor-- needed alot more.

I made this tonight and was pleasantly surprised. Once you incorporate all ingredients you may have to either add water, chicken broth or milk to avoid the dish from getting dry/gooey. It is delicious and well worth making. We all enjoyed it and will prepare again.

It was just okay. I should have added more garlic as we thought it was on the bland side. I even replaced the water with white wine. Maybe I will try Marsala wine next time.

I didn't have mushrooms to work with but I did have bacon. I cooked and broke up bacon, setting aside. I followed recipe for sauce, but also added some milk. Mixed in cooked shrimp and bacon until heated through. Tossed with fettuccine instead of linguini. Was a big hit, both my son and bf licked their plates clean. You can add what ever you like. I also noticed someone thought the sauce was too thin, for a thicker sauce just add cornstarch or flour, but be sure to mix with water or milk before adding to sauce.

This made a nice sauce, but for me it needed more taste. In addition to using 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup heavy cream, I added 8 oz. Velveeta cheese, 3 Tablespoons grated parmesan, and about 1/2 tsp. salt. My family loved it.

Just tried it, the shrimps and the mushrooms really go well together! Sauted the mushrooms and prawns in olive oil and garlic and refreshed with white wine. I also boiled the shells and heads of the shrimps and used that water instead of using plain hot water,it adds more shrimp flavor. I guess im not a very big fan of basil, so next time ill use less or maybe none. Ill add mushroom cream to the sauce and maybe some dried tomatoes to be more colorful. Needs a little improvement but has a lot of potencial :D

I used white wine to make it less thick and added imitation crab.  It was yummy!  Better than buying alfredo sauce in the jar according to the hubby.

Excellent. It's the type of recipe that you can throw whatever you've got in the fridge in there too. I had leftover green beans and salmon... In they went.
I have an herb garden, so I put in basil, parsley, and mint. to die for! Doesn't taste good leftover.

This recipe was a big hit. I would reduce the amount of butter next time. Added water chestnuts and Italian herb seasoning which gave it more flavor and a little crunch. Would definitely make again.

This recipe was easily doubled for a large family.  I added salt to taste and when we served it, we sprinkled a bit of shredded parmesan on top to add to the presentation.  My children loved it and wanted me to add it to our family cookbook for quick access.  I'm really glad I found this recipe.  It was quick and easy to fix and a real winner!

Absolutely terrific, quick, easy, delicious.  The only thing it isn't is low fat!  Even my picky kids asked for more.  Great for company or a nice weekend meal.  Thanks so much!  We loved it just as written.

I followed the directions very closely, minus the fresh parsley. I also added zucchini. One of the very first things I cooked that I was proud of! Very good recipe for beginners.

even using the full 8 oz cream cheese, milk and wine, it  was still not enough sauce for the amount of linguini called for the recipe. i think the shrimps should have been seasoned and grilled before throwing into the mix. just felt that this was below average and not as tasty as all the other reviews make it seem. will probably never make again. would rather have mac and cheese from the box.

Company worthy! Anything but healthy, however deliscious! I added a little white wine as rewiewers suggested and 8 oz cream cheese. Also added peas for color.  Next time will reduce butter and cream cheese both, I think it would be just as good if it was not heavy.

This was delicious! The only changes we made was using herb cream cheese (purely out of convenience but it added delightful flavor) and adding extra mushrooms because we are both huge mushroom lovers. I will be making this again!

This was very good in my opinion.  I'm a pasta with cream sauce lover and it's what I often order when out at a restaurant.  This is definitely restaurant quality.  My family of 5 all loved it.  I made a few changes and took suggestions from other reviews.  I increased everything because of my three sons who are big eaters and hubby too.  More shrimp, more mushrooms (portabella), more of the seasonings, more cream cheese, added chicken, added  milk, added parmesan cheese, added shallots and added sea salt.  Wow!

Its hard to give an honest rating after having make changes suggested by other reviewers. I added red onion to the butter and mushrooms at the start and then added spinach and marsala wine instead of the boiling water. With these changes its a 5. A great recipe.

I love this recipe!  I found it about a year ago and am still making it.  It's easy and delicious.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and used a wisk to break up the cream cheese which worked great.  I could have added some more mushrooms and shrimp but as is is delicious as well.

Used fresh prawns and cursed many times while I was peeling.  Used fresh linguini pasta, and as per some previous reviewers, 8 ounces of cream cheese,  made the hot water half wine and half water.  Also skipped the step about frying the mushrooms, microwaved them and then drained to add near the end.  Bon Appetite!

I made a few substitutions.  First I used dried herbs because thats what I had on hand.  Also instead of water I used 2% milk.  It made the sauce come out creamy and full of flavor.   This is good with chicken, shrimp or just poured over pasta by itself!

This was wonderful, beautiful and easy. Will try it with both scallops and shrimp next time. I too used white wine, chicken stock (instead of water), fresh basil and cremini mushrooms. Impressive!!

Very, very delicious!  I didn’t have mushrooms or cream cheese so I used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  I love this sauce because it is heavy enough to cover up the fishy taste and smell that shrimp can have.  I also added broccoli since I have a thing about having a meat, starch and vegetable in every meal I make.  I think this made it a really fulfilling meal, will definitely make again.

I cooked this for my girlfriend and her parents for Valentine's Day and we all loved it. I don't even like mushrooms or shrimp but the sauce made it so good I had to eat it.  One suggestion on the recipe I would make though, is making a little bit more sauce with the linguini.

Good base.  I doubled the sauce ingredients because I added extra vegetables and wanted enough for the pasta to absorb.  Also had to add salt and pepper.

This was very tasty. However, next time I make it, I will probably use a little less butter, and a little less cream cheese to make it a bit more healthy. This dish would probably also be good with the addition of some onions.

I like the sauce in this recipe but was unsure of the mixture of shrimp and mushrooms together.  Personal taste but they didn't work for me.  If I make it again it will be one or the other, not both.

This is the third meal I have ever cooked and when my boyfriend ate it he said, "it tastes like we took home leftovers from an italian restaurant". Thats a compliment to me!  I didn't have any basil, and threw in some leftover pinot grigio i had, put in a little extra cream cheese, a little extra garlic, and a little more shrimp.  Will definitely make again!!

This is SOOOO good!!  For a low carb version, we omitted the pasta and added squash & zucchini.  Both of our sons loved this too (ages 5 & 9) so this recipe ranks as kid friendly too.  An absolute winner in our house!

It was ok. I added spinich and substituted garlic powder for minced garlic. Sauce was dryed up for leftovers so I will probably just add a little milk. I probably won't make with shrimp again and add in tomatoes and chicken.

Great pasta!! I would be careful with the water b/c if you put too much in the sauce, the sauce will come out a little runny (I like my sauce on the thicker side), however, I used low fat cream cheese so this may have contributed to it not being as thick. Also, after I put in the mushrooms to simmer in the butter for a few minutes, I added in some chopped tomatoes and spinach (with a smidge of garlic, salt, and crushed red pepper). Yuuummmmm!!! We like things a little spicey in our house...the red pepper added a little zing but wasn't real spicy!! The easiest and best pasta recipe we have had! Thank you so much for sharing with us!! Ps. My husband HATES leftovers but insisted I make a little more so he can take some to work!! Great recipe!

This was awesome.  I am not a big cream based sauce fan, but this was fantastic.  I cooked it a little different after reading some other reviews to include adding a few dashes of black pepper, evaporated milk and chicken broth in lieu of the water, and added more shrimp than called for.  This will become a regular dish at our meal table.

Very good. I had a problem with the sauce separating on me but adding the water at the end helped smooth it out a bit. Didn't look real pretty, but tasted great. I also added 1 chicken breast cut in strips and sauteed with the mushrooms to add a little more bulk. Will make again!

Oh my!  This was delicious.  I practically licked the plate clean.  Made only minor adjustments.  Added one can chicken broth instead of water.  I like a soupier sauce as the pasta soaks up so much liquid.  Doubled mushrooms and cream cheese and added some green peas leftover in the frig.  Will be making this often.   Thanks for sharing.

for some reason my cream cheese didn't want to melt.  After bout 10 minutes of stirring and squishing I added a tablespoon of flour to the mixture, let it thicken up, then slowly added a cup of milk while whisking.  This saved it.  Tasted alright.

This was really good. The kids loved it so much they never even complained when I served the leftovers the next day, which is saying something.  Reheats nicely...I thought the cream cheese (I used a tub of herb and garlic) might get sticky overnight, but it was still fab the next day!

I stayed almost exact with the recipe given! The only change I made was substituted the fresh parsley for half the amount of dried. Used whole wheat pasta and 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 cup seemed a bit much. Recipe is a keeper for me especially with all the substitutions you can make!

My rating was based on the original recipe without any major modifications:  I made this fairly true to the original, the only changes I made were cutting the butter in half and subbing olive oil, subbing milk for some of the water (I used a little of the pasta water to help the sauce stick better), and added about 2 oz. more cream cheese.  Way too bland for my taste, and the sauce was a bit watery.    I added salt, pepper, and parmasan, and the taste was much improved, though I still feel it's missing some flavor, which could be added with a little wine.  Also, the dish needs both the shrimp and mushrooms doubled (at least), plus chicken or any other additions as I saw listed in other reviews.

This was the first recipe I tried off of this website and I think I'm hooked now! This was SO easy and SO good! I did add some asparagus, but only because I like to throw some nutrition in anywhere I can. It worked so well! I went off some other reviews and added some milk rather than the water. Maybe I just added too much because I thought the sauce was then too runny. But it was amazing, will definitely make it again!

omg sooo good. I left out the butter to make it healthier and never missed it, just used a little pam in the pan. I also used chive cream cheese cause that's what I had on hand, next time I might use reduced fat cream cheese and see how that goes.

I made this dish last night with a few minor changes. It was fantastic!!! In addition to the mushrooms, I also added fresh spinach. And used angel hair pasta instead. I also used dried parsley and used more cream cheese than the recipe called for, but the results were FAB!!! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

WOW! This, I have to warn you, is VERY good and VERY rich! My mom, who always orders this kind of stuff at restaurants, swears this was the best she'd ever had, and I would have to agree. I am not that big on creamy sauces, but this one was more than edible. I would only add more basil, maybe sub some of the parsley with extra basil, but that's mostly because I love the taste of it. Anyway, I doubled the recipe and it went quickly- you won't go wrong making this for dinner. Be warned though the flavor is very thick and rich, which might help those prone to eating seconds and thirds think twice :)

Definitely not on the low fat list of recipes, but a tasty splurge.  Had to substitute oregano for the parsley, and used chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain.  Delicious!

Quick and easy week night supper!  Used the helpful tips from the other reviews for minor changes:  1) Used low fat herb and garlic cream cheese; therefore, left out the basil and parsley (but still added four cloves of garlic). 2) Instead of only adding in water to thin out the sauce I used a few splashes of chicken broth. 3) Only had whole wheat rotini on hand so used that which the sauce coated well.

Good, but a little flat. Needs some salt and pepper. I also prefer a thicker sauce, this sauce was a little thin for my liking. Won't make this one again.

It was good but lacking something.  It needs some more depth.    I added green peppers and peas.  i also used pasta water and a splash of white wine.  It was a good dish but will play with some spices.

We loved this!! My picky kids even loved it. I substituted the cream cheese for an 8oz. package of cream cheese with chives. I also added grilled chicken. It will definitely be made again in our house! Delicious!

This is delightfully simple and really good.  Tonight I made it with 3 oz of cream frache instead of the cream cheese and 1 tbs of fresh basil instead of dried - it was simply sublime!

It's a good dish but slightly bland for my tasting. I'm not a white sauce person because I feel there's not as much flavor. This really tasted like Alfredo sauce which I'm not big on and my husband isn't either. I even added some things like onions, red peppers and extra garlic and it still wasn't "great". There again, I do feel it was worth trying... Just not my favorite...

It was really good. But I also added white wine and only about 1 cup of water. Also added some evaporated milk to make it alittle more creamy. But all together loved this recipe even my picky three year old ate it..

This is so delicious...I made it for my scrapbook group and they said it was like a restuarant meal...I did read up on the reviews and made some altercations here and there, but it was absolutely wonderful and I will make it again!

this was a great, simple recipe. I added a bit more parsley and basil than called for in the original recipe. I was a little surprised how long it took for the cream cheese to de-chunk, but once the water was added, the sauce looked great.

I made this tonight for the family, including my 3 year old lactose-intolerant Celiac son. Everyone raved about it! I used soy cream cheese, rice pasta, and rice milk as substitutes. Thanks to previous reviewers for suggestions about seasonings and reducing the amount of butter (I used oil instead). I served it with salad and (wheat-free) bread. A fabulous, filling, and satisfying meal. P.S. I found this recipe on the allrecipes spinner on my iPod Touch. What a find!!

This was pretty good.  The sauce started to scare me because the cream cheese was not looking pretty until I added pasta water.  I used the fat free cream cheese and it still turned out great.  I added marsala wine, but I tasted the sauce before and after the wine and it was good both ways.

This was pretty good but it needs something....  Of course I was out of mushrooms and that would have helped. Next time I make this, I think I am going to try one of the suggested changes.

Very good!  I used fresh mushroom and they tasted a bit bland.  I think frozen mushrooms would have done just as well if not better.  Kept good for the next day's lunch.

This recipe is great and I make it all the time!  Instead of water, I use 2/3 cup half & half.  Also, sometimes I will add 1/2 lb imitation crab meat.

Excellent recipe, and I did 2/3 white wine instead of water. Turned out great,and added a little different flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

This was easy and so good! I had no idea you could make white sauce the way.  Next time i will try some variations. You could do a million different things with this recipe.  Will do this again very soon.(Daughter loved it!)

Fabulous.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.  Sprinkled 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan on top.

Great recipe!  Really delicious.  Upped the shrimp to 1 pound.  Cook shrimps with mushrooms.  Added cooked shrimp liquid to 1/4 cup milk.  Add this mixture to the cream cheese (1/2 cup)/butter/garlic sauce.

I thought the sauce came out a bit watery. I made the recipe exactly as stated- but if I were to make it again, I wouldn't add the water, I would add milk- and I would add more cream cheese. My husband and I like the Shrimp Lemon Pepper Linguini recipe much better than this one.

Very nice.  I used 8 oz light chive & onion cream cheese, baby portobello mushrooms and white wine instead of water.  Cut the butter in half.  Will definitely make again!

great recipe will make again.  I did what some of the other views suggested and added white wine and the mushroom and shrimp juices with a little milk.  I made it with light creamcheese and 1%milk and it was great! I will add onions and more italian spices next time.

This recipe was fantastic!  We did follow several user suggestions:  Replace the boiling water with a heavy cream/white wine mixture, add green onions and chopped tomatoes, add a little cayanne pepper.  We will definately make this again

I added wine and milk instead of water, along with some extra fresh basil and extra shrimp.  This had very good flavor, but all that butter adds a lot of calories.

Used white wine instead of the water, added assorted fresh herbs (oregano, rosemary, thyme), and mix of crimini and white button mushrooms.  I didn't increase the amount of cream cheese as it wasn't necessary.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was really tasty.  The only change I made was to add some sauteed onion along with the mushrooms and garlic.  This is a quick, simple dish that's really good.  We'll definitely make it again.

made this last night and it was a super hit!!  My picky 5 year old even ate it.  I did saute asparugus and red peppers with the mushrooms.  And instead of the water, I used a wine/half and half mixture.  My husband made sure this one went into the recipe box.

I had baby bella mushrooms and shrimp in my frig, plugged it into search and this is the recipe that came up.  This was a fantastic recipe!  The sauce was very, very tasty.  I always try to follow the recipe as listed the first time....then I can decide whether I need to tweek it to my liking.  No tweeking here, it's great!  Only thing I did different was I used whole wheat linguini.  Thank you for this recipe, GREAT!

Truly unique flavor! I really don't understand reviews that said it was bland--impossible! I took the advice of others and substituted equal servings of milk and white wine for the water. You must be patient when stirring the cream cheese in: good things come to those who wait! I added chopped bell peppers for some crunch.

Very tasty recipe.  To make it a bit healthier, I sauteed the mushrooms in a non-stick pan with a bit of cooking spray and cut back the rest of the butter to about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup.  Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 milk (I used 1%) and 1/2 white wine instead of the water, and I also used a bit more cream cheeze (4oz of the lower fat kind).  I didn't have any fresh herbs, so I used dried italian seasoning and parsley, and it worked just fine.  I would make this again.

I doubled the recipe, and used 8 oz. of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Wine in lieu of water, also added some red bell peppers and onions. Very good, served with veggie egg rolls.

Very good, I left out the mushrooms (picky kids) and used other veggie. Served over baked spaghetti squash, everyone from my 1 yr old to 12 yr old really liked it. I used 3oz cream cheese, white wine for the water. Good base.

This is the perfect shrimp & pasta dish!  Restaurant quality -but better in my opinion.  The sauce was exactly what I was hoping for, though I only added 1/2 the water it called for.  I skipped the mushrooms but may try them next time.

I did this on my birthday because I love pasta. This was good. I followed the suggestions of 5RUBYMOM14 & it came out yummy but a bit too thin. So I thickened it up with some cornstarch & water. My Husband loved it! I think next time, I will add some chopped tomatoes at the end. Can't wait to do this again.

Very tasty, used 1 cup white wine in place of boiling water. Also used low 8 oz. cream cheese (did not have 3 oz.). Great recipe was enjoyed by family

Mmmmmm.  Very good.  It was a little bland until I added some parmesan, otherwise good.  I only used about half the amount of cream cheese.

Very tasty and good.  Although I did change the recipe slightly by cutting down the cream cheese and substituting it with milk and corn starch and it turned out very nice and creamy!  Even my picky husband liked this.  I will make it again.

This sounded great, but it was to heavy for my family. I took other members suggestions and used 8oz of cream cheese but it was waaayy to much.

I have made this recipe exactly as is 3 times and we all love it in this family!  Used peas and grape tomatoes (halved) instead of mushrooms last night.  Very rich and delicious.  Great with crusty bread and salad.

It was a little too runny so I added a little heavy whipping cream, some asiago and romano cheeses, and shallots. I've never tried cream cheese in a white sauce but it turned out awesome.

The day of, I rate it 3 stars, the sauce is too saucy.  But re-heated the next day, everything is restaurant quality.  Leftovers get 5 stars.  Yummy.

I added asparagus and extra garlic with the mushrooms, because I am a garlic nut.
I also used milk instead of water this was one of the best recipes. And oh so easy.

This sauce is great!I had shrimp left over from our Super Bowl party, and looked on the All Recipes site to see if I could find something for supper. This recipe was a real winner. Instead of mushrooms(since I had none)I added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and milk instead of water. It was absolutely delicious. Thankyou very much.

Very good recipe. Use the pasta water, or add a little white wine before simmering. I used uncooked shrimp and sauteed them with the mushrooms. Also added a little chopped bell pepper. Didn't have parsley but dried Italian Seasonings substituted nicely. A chopped roma tomato sprinkled as garnish on top would be really nice compliment, I'll try that next time. Thanks for the delicious texture and flavor.

Loved the taste!  The sauce was more runny than creamy though.  I wish I had the time to go over the reviews before I had cooked it.  I definitely will make again, but cut the butter and use milk instead of water like others suggested.  Texture issues aside, even the kids loved it- thanks!

This is a good base recipe - I love to play around with things, and this definitely allows for that.  I used a full 8oz. bar of cream cheese, milk instead of water, and added some dice roma tomato as a garnish.  I also like to cook the shrimp with a little cajun seasoning (either Tony Sachare's or Zatterain's) to give them zing.

This was fun!   I think it is one of the easiest Alfredo type sauces to create.  I used "Smart Balance" instead of butter and less cream cheese but it was still yummy.

This recipe is very yummy and easy to make.  I have added chicken and asparagus, which makes it even better! I do make a little more sauce than asked, which makes up for what I add.

This was YUMMY! I'm a fairly new cook, I started a year ago and this was SUPER simple!! 
I also made minor adjustments"
Instead of water, I used 3/4 cup skim milk, along with 6oz of cream cheese instead of the 3oz. I also added about 4-5 cloves of garlic, and it definately needed about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to taste!!

Also don't substitute the butter!! It's the main flavor of the sauce!! Mine came out a tiny bit thick, but i think thats because I over cooked it, so don't do that!! Will definatley be a keeper in my cookbook ;)

I made this recipe exactly as it was written.  It was really good, but I had to add quite a bit of salt to achieve that.  Next time I will try adding chicken broth instead of water to the sauce(as was suggested by another reviewer).

I used prior comments and increased the cream cheese to 8 oz. and also added 1/2 cup of white wine. I've made with both shrimp and chicken and they are both wonderful.  A recipe I will definitely make again and again!

Not much taste----I stayed true to the recipe; if I make it again, I'll play around with some flavoring.

I tried to make this a little healthier by using whole wheat linguini and reduced fat cream cheese.  I doubled the cream cheese to 6 0z and added some fat free sour cream to make it a little saucier.  I thought it was great.

Very good.  This is a keeper I used boursin cheese and frozen cilantro cubes and the taste is superb. I will try cream cheese and not as much butter next time. Maybe EVO and there will be a next time.

This is a real keeper.  Rich and creamy. Even pleased my picky 7 yr. old.  Served with a salad and sourdough slices with EVOO, toasted.  Yummmmm.

I made this and my husband loved it.  I made it without shrimp though because I don't care for seafood.  Very good.  I felt it was a little dry but that could be because the noodles sat too long.  Next time I will make them at the very end.

I served this with spinich salad, toasted pita and garlic hummus...and my roommate loved it. I added some garlic and onion powder to it as well as salt to give it more taste. Also substituted in 1/3C cream to make it thicker. Overall, a nice-tasting dish that you can put together in 20min. Thanks!

This was ok.  It was a little too bland for my taste and so I had to add a lot of salt and pepper.  I used canned sliced mushrooms so I didn't saute the mushrooms and just added along with the shrimp.  I used only 3 tablespoons butter, double the amount of cream cheese, milk instead of water, and sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese (for additional seasoning and flavor).  Quick and easy to make.  Thanks.

This turned out Great!  I also used 8oz. cream cheese and 5 cloves of garlic.  At first I was a little skeptical of the sauce when I had only added the 3oz. of the cream cheese it seemed too bland and thin, so I added the rest of the package of cream cheese and some extra garlic and it was a hit with the whole family!  Everyone had seconds and wanted to know when I was going to make it again.

Awesome recipe although it seems to work better if you double the recipe. I know that sounds weird but the consistancy comes out better. Add some grated parmesean to the top and serve with Garlic bread, you are ready to go.

Awesome.  Very rich.  Both of us thought that it needed just a pinch of salt to bring out the sea food flavor.  Also, we love garlic so we more than doubled the recommended amount.  Will make again.

This was so good! It tasted like something you would order in a resteraunt. I couldn't afford the larger shrimp so I used fresh salad shrimp.  I liked it because you could eat them easily.  I also used more garlic, lemon pepper, 2 (3oz) pkg of cream cheese, 2/3 cup milk and 1/4 of water.  It came out really creamy and the sauce covered all the noodles (I used a whole box so it would feed my whole family).  I'm also going to try it with chicked and broccoli!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I added 1/2 of a lg sweet onion, sliced, to the mushrooms when I sauteed them and I did double the sauce since I used 12 oz of pasta. I didn't have butter so I used margarine. I did leave out the water and used a little 1/2 and 1/2 and 1% milk instead. I also used a lb of shrimp.It was a huge hit with my husband and 14 yr old daughter!!!!!

Quite good, but nothing special. Made with milk as earlier reviews suggested. Would probably make again if I happened to have excess mushrooms and shrimp at the same time again.

It had a very good flavor but it tasted a lot like the Pasta-Roni pasta out of the boxes.  Seems easier just to make it out of the box than to get the same result with more time.

I used whipped cream cheese, so I never experienced the lumpiness. I used milk instead of water, too. It was fantastic after it had sat in the fridge for a day and reheated in the microwave.

My Dad is a farmer and he can work up quite the appetite, so when he comes in for lunch I try to have a nice meal prepared for him and this did just that. The first thing he said when he tried it was, "veeery good" and his eyes got nice and big. Plus it was quick, perfect for his busy schedule.

MMM! This is yummy! Thanks for the great recipe..I did make a few changes for what I had on hand, used Italian seasoning instead of fresh parsley and canned mushrooms rather than fresh! Excellent, I am sure it is even better with the required ingrediants.  thanks!!

Gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes. Didn't have quite 8 oz mushrooms so used some reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms. I added 2 chopped green onions & 1/2 chopped jalapeno pepper to the mushrooms. Also used 2 T butter & 2 T olive oil. Used 12 oz. shrimp & 6 oz. cr. cheese & a dash of cayenne. Turned out great!!

Very good. I did add more garlic and used milk instead of water as some others did. I used a little more shrimp as well. My husband liked it a lot.

My expectations might have been too high (based on the other reviews of this recipe), but this recipe didn't WOW me.  I thought it was OK.  My boyfriend liked it, but neither of us loved it.

FABULOUS!!!  I substituted 1 pound of asparagus cut into 1 inch lengths for the shrimp, increased the mushrooms to 3/4 pounds, added to chopped green onions and diced sweet pepper.  I garnished with snipped chives and passed Parmesian cheese.  I can't wait to try other combinations including pork (my husband had a pork chop on the side). I'm also going to substitute nutmeg for the basil when using pork.

While this recipe was really easy to prepare, I wasn't that fond of the sauce. It was too thick. If I ever make again, I think I will use half the cream cheese and add milk to it or something. Or, I may find a new sauce recipe and just add the herb spices in this one. But I was excited to use shrimp in a recipe because that was new for me. What a good looking and good smelling meal. Very fancy!

All of the "big kids" loved this.  I substituted the cream cheese with the chive flavored whipped cream cheese..yummy!  I served it with quicky package of ceasar salad and Pepperidge Farms five cheese and garlic bread (frozen).  Fattening as all get out..but a restaurant style yumminess.
