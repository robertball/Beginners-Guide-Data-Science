This recipe is so simple.  I made some changes to it because I had other ingredients:  I used fully cooked kiebasa and boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of the hambone and sausage.  I also only had onion, potato, carrot and cabbage.  My daughter loved this, even though she "doesn't like cooked cabbage!"  Thanks, Karen!

Wow! I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, I thought it be bland and boring with no spices or garlic, but it was terrific. I didn't have ham hocks so I used only wild rice brats. I sliced them and sauteed them, then sauteed the root vegetables in a little olive oil, and used chicken broth instead of water. Next time I'd like to add some garlic.

Great recipe!  I had turnips, carrots, garlic scapes, cabbage and kohlrabi from my CSA share and didn't know what to make.  Pulled out some smoked sausage and started there.  I didn't have ham hocks, but not to worry.  Sliced the sausage and sauteed with a sweet onion.  Deglazed the pan with white wine as well.  In a crockpot I put 5 chopped turnips, 1 chopped kohlrabi, carrots, and a few garlic scapes sliced thin.  I added a can of black beans and corn and a bouillon cube.  Lastly I added a can of mild chiles and didn't add the cabbage  until about an hour before serving.  My husband said the turnips tasted like potatoes and it was a great soup.  Super easy and used my produce the best way I could find.

The ONE time I go to buy ham hocks, the store didn't have them. Typical! Instead I used a boneless piece of ham that I diced into chunks. I made it as written, and thought it was pretty bland, so I ended up adding a lot of garlic powder, onion powder, and also some chicken bouillon paste. Much better. Happy New Year everyone!

This recipe is really good! I cooked it in the slow cooker with about 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk instead of water to make it creamy, and it might have actually worked if I'd added more milk as it cooked out. Spicy sausage gave it a nice kick, too. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was a great "after the barn chores on a cold night" meal.  Put it on before we went out and it was ready when we came in!  Talk about easy!!

I left out the rutabagas and turnips.  I live in a VERY small town and we very rarely can get anything like that.  I also added chunks of bacon and we ate the sausage on the side.  In a round-about way, a very hearty meal.  Easy too.

We took the meat out and replaced it with white beans to make it vegan. Delicious!

I loved this- except I forgot that I actually hate rutabaga- oops! Will make again, minus rutabaga. This recipe actually got my picky fiance' to eat cabbage, of all things!

Getting the kids to try something new espesially vegetables is always hard around here. They just ate it up. They loved everything even the new vegetables. Very good thanks.

Halfed the recipe and it was still a huge pot. It was so good and flavorful and I almost always think recipes taste bland. I will use a whole head of cabbage for a half recipe the next time. Oh, my potatoes were sweet potatoes Cuz that's what came in my CSA box. DELIC!

I only gave this 4 stars because the cook time is off. The vegetables took at least 20 minutes longer to cook. But the flavor was delcious! Even my normally picky 9 year old cleared his plate although he said the rutabagas were yuck, he still ate them so I say this recipe was a success!
