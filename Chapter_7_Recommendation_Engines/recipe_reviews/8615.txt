This was a refreshing change to most wrapped sandwiches I've tried. I made a few minor tweaks. To the simmering chicken I doubled the amount of garlic powder and onion powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of fajita seasoning. To the pitas I added monterey jack / colby cheese and diced onions to the pitas. I made these changes because previous reviewers commented on the chicken not being flavorful enough. My recipe was scaled to 4 servings. Even though my pita did fall apart (I always try to pack too much in), I really enjoyed these. My favorite part was the avocado. Delicious! In the future I plan on doubling the amount of salsa used to make it a little more saucey.

Great recipe. The pita bread fell apart, though, next time I'll try it with flour tortillas instead.

Yum!  This makes a quick, tasty weeknight dinner.  I added some Monterey Jack cheese as suggested by another reviewer and I also threw in some sliced black olives.

Delicious, easy recipe.  Easy to modify if you like it more or less spicy--I didn't even measure anything.  It's great just the way it is, but also awesome if you take out the sour cream and add sharp cheddar and garlic mayo.

I doubled all of the spices except cayenne pepper as suggested by a previous reviewer and used Hidden Vally Ranch dressing instead of sour cream (i tried 1 with each and liked the ranch better) This was a nice change from our normal meals and I know that I will be making this again really soon.

Very tasty! I followed the recipes main ingredients and then added a few of my own. I added some diced red and green bell peppers and some diced onions and I used HOT salsa. As far as the toppings go I just put some shredded Colby/Monterey Jack cheese on top (but sour cream I bet would be great too). Enjoy!

As I was making it just for myself, I cut back on the cayenne. And like the previous reviewer, I used Ranch dressing instead of sour cream. So delicious. Thanks, Kim!

This was fabulous!  Everyone liked it.  I was worried about it being too spicy for the kids so I reduced the cayenne pepper and left the salsa as a topping for those who wanted it.  (It wasn't too spicy).  I forgot about the sour cream, but my husband used the ranch dressing and loved it.

I made this at night and ate it cold for lunch the next day.  It was quite tasty and easy to make.  I will probably add cheese next time.

I enjoy spicy foods, so I used a 'medium' spicy chunky salsa.  It added a little extra flavor without being too over the top.  I added a little monterey/colby jack cheese on top as well.  This is a simple recipe, and the results were great!

Awesome, and SO EASY!!  I am no where near a chef, and I was able to do this.  It was so quick, and took no skill.  Frying up the meat it looked "meh", but then add the spices and the salsa and it looks and tastes AMAZING!! A+++

These were ok, but a little dry.  I added more salsa after initially tasting them and it was better.  They would probably be good if you added sliced black olives, corn, or some shredded cheese, etc.

This is a quick Saturday afternoon lunch.  Make sure to drain the chicken good before adding the salsa, or it may end up too soupy.  My husband and I liked the flavor, although it tasted just like plain spicy chicken.  Maybe another spice to make it more unique would be a good addition.  We used the tortillas, and they worked great.  We'll probably try this one again, with just a little tweaking.  A good recipe overall.

I used chicken breasts that had already been cooked.  Still, very good.  I believe this will be a family favorite for a quick and easy meal.

This was a tasty healthy meal.  My kids didn't care for the spice as much as the adults, but we loved it.  I made it very close to the recipe, but I added a bit more seasoning because we like lots of flavor,I substituted guacamole in place of the avacado because it was on hand, and we added some shredded cheese.  Very quick and tasty.

A++. Very very good. I double the seasonings for the chicken (except the salt & cayenne) and used spicy salsa. Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and whole wheat pitas. Also added slices olives to the mix. VERY flavorful and everyone couldn't get enough! This recipe feeds 3 easily. Thanks!

This is really good.  I used Chobani nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It tastes very similar, has no fat and a ton of protein.  Great, easy recipe. Thanks

Tasty! The one problem I had was that my pitas fell apart when I stuffed them and I really had trouble getting everything in there. I used homemade salsa. I mixed all the dry seasonings together and sprinkled this on the chicken before cooking rather than after to really flavor the chicken. I think this would work even better rolled in a tortilla. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Delicious and so easy!  Didn't change a thing.  Thank you.  Know that this taste really good cold too: I cool the chicken, mix the salsa (no cooking)in and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Yummy!

Big hit with the kids!  They loved stuffing their own pitas.  I used half the amount of cayenne that the recipe called and it was plenty spicy.

This was very good with the spices doubled.  I "cheated" and used precooked grilled chicken from the store, as I was extremely short on time.  I made guacamole instead of just adding avocados.  Very good recipe!  Thank you for sharing

I made this for my daughter's lunch.  I left out the cayenne pepper and salsa as she doesen't like spicy food.  I just sprinkled the garlic powder, onion powder and salt on the chicken strips as I was cooking them.  She loved it.  I ate the rest and thought it was very good.

I loved these!  I changed my serving size to four and doubled the spices except the cayenne, salt and pepper.  I also added 3/4 cup of salsa to make it a little saucier.  It was soooo good, especially with the avocado.  Too spicy for the chilluns but I gave them plain chicken instead.  Yummmm!

Marvelous!  I loved this recipe.  The chicken was slightly spicy and did not taste like salsa.  All the ingredients were a little difficult to wedge into a pita without tearing it completely apart, but ooohhh, it was good.  Even my husband asked for this to be put into the regular rotation.

Oh man these are good! I forgot to buy some salsa for this but I decided to try this recipe without it.Maybe it was the avacado or the sour cream but everything seemed perfect.BTW...this was the first time I had tried avacado,I see now that I've been living a deprived life. :-)
For such a simple recipe this turned out great,I'll be making this a few more times....at least.Thanks Kim for sharing this with us.

Wow! This recipe is AWESOME! This is a big hit with my family, and my husband asks for them all the time! I use whole-wheat tortillas instead of the pita bread, but that's the only substitution I've made. This is a yummy recipe and is now a staple in our household! Love it!!

I added montery Jack cheese and didn't put it in the pita (lower carb). It was really good, will make it often...

Loved this! Light and Summery. The seasoning is great. We sauteed some red onion on the side for a garnish as well. Adding this to the rotation, thank you!

Excellent! This got great reviews at our dinner party. We served 1/2 with spicy salsa cooked in, and 1/2 with mild.

This recipe is very good.  I didn't have any trouble with pitas falling apart.  I could easliy see this being served in a restaurant for lunch.  However, I agree with one reviewer that the chicken was bland -- but had spices on it.  If we could fix that about this recipe, I would have given it 5 stars.

Easy to prepare and you still end up with a fairly wholesome meal. Great weeknight dinner or lunch. Seasonings can be modified to your tastes but an overall wonderful recipe!

This was a delicious recipe, my family loved it! I did take some advice from others such as the ½ teaspoon of fajita seasoning. The only alterations I made was instead of Cayenne pepper I used chili powder and paprika, I set mine to 6 servings and used ¼ Teaspoon Chili Powder ½ Teaspoon Paprika and added ½ Teaspoon of Garlic Powder and Onion Powder. The salsa is definitely up to you.

This is a great recipe! The only changes we made was to substitute spinach for the lettuce and feta cheese for the sour cream/salsa. The pita pockets were delicious and it was a very flavorful meal. Definitely go with wheat pitas over the regular ones - so good!

We like this. We've had it twice so far.  The kids even like it.  Its a bit spicy for small mouths so we tone it down some.

Great recipe Kim. I really enjoyed the salsa mixture but my pita fell apart and was messy to eat. I am going to try it next time with Tortillas!
