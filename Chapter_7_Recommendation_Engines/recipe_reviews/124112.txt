Wow, I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipes is. I put half the berries into the food processor. Gives the jam a finer texture. I used eight cups of berries, four cups of sugar, two packages of lemon gelatin and one packet of certo. I made this recipe yesterday and we just had our first try. Mmmmmm  A definite recipe keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious jam. I followed all directions with the exception of crushing the berries. Instead I followed one of the other reviewers advice to put the berries in the food processor for a bit of a smoother texture. It came out perfect and the texture and consistency was just right. I don't believe that you need the certo like others have suggested. I will be adding this to our families favorites and be making it again next year.

I was a little nervous using lemon jello but to my surprise it turned out PERFECT! The taste was very good with only a subtle hint of lemon and plenty of blueberry flavor! The consistency was perfect too and it set up nicely...not runny at all. This is definitely a keeper and I didn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe!

I am pretty happy with this recipe but,next time I think I will use unflavored pectin. I used Splenda instead of the sugar and sealed the jam in the hot canning jars. I then placed them in a hot water bath. It turned out good.

This was super easy & set up perfectly. The flavors blend very nicely, not too tart, not too sweet. Made about 27oz total jam.

I used the recipe just as listed except I substituted the lemon jello for sugar free lemon jello and the 2 cups of sugar for 1.5 cups of Splenda.  As the Jello was sugar free, the Splenda worked great with it - it set up really well and - NO added sugar and it tastes great!

Super easy, Super fast!  I made this last summer with some fresh berries from my yard.  This was the first time making jam but it couldn't have been easier.  I did put my berries in the blender after they cooked for a while. then I returned them to the pan and added the jello & let it thicken, then put into jars and it set up great.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe is GREAT!!!  Super easy and yummy too!  I've used this a couple times.  My kids love it and I'm using it as gifts for their teachers.  The only change I made was instead of regular jello, I used sugar free and it still seemed to set up fine.

Sooooo easy!  Two changes I made:  used 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda; instead of lemon Jell-o, I used a new Jell-o flavor called Blackberry Fusion (blackberry and raspberry flavored.)  Tastes awesome and the smell alone was mouth-watering!

I absolutly loved the flavors of this recipe. I was skeptical about using the jello instead of pectin. My jam did set but it soften quickly. I like my jam to be able to set on the shelf so i added liquid pectin(1 pouch) and resealed the jars. This recipe is a DEFINATE keeper; I am making it again for Christmas presents. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

So easy and so good! This was a good alternative to store bought jam for my family, because we like our jam a little tarter. The only hard thing is waiting for the jam to cool before you can eat it!

I used raspberry jello mix instead of the lemon and it came out ten times better.

This is very good. Although the lemon flavor was a bit pronounced, I still enjoyed it with toast and a glass of cold milk. I'm going to experiment with different flavors of jello next time too!

I did not use the full amount of sugar. I used 1/2 cup of Splenda and a couple tablespoons of organic honey and I also used SF jello. Perfectly sweet and just great. I got almost two full pint jars out of this. I served it over my Whole Wheat-Flax Seed-Banana pancakes and the kids inhaled it! Super easy to make in the morning and serve warm over pancakes. This is a keeper.

Really good flavor and was easy to make.  Like some other reviewers, I crushed some of the berries (about 2/3 of them) in a food processor for a smoother texture.  Got lots of rave reviews from friends & family, will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful recipe. Worthy of the cookbooks. I was worried about the sugar in the gelatin, but it turned out fine. Loads of great reviews. A great use for all the squished berries you get when you buy the large flats. I will be giving this away for xmas presents! Thank you Joyce!

I am reviewing this as I made it and gave to my sister...I have not tried it yet myself. So I will post my review when I try it....but the 5 star is what my sister gives it. She told me that this jam is "store quality"! Absolutely loved it! And that I should sell it??!! She is my biggest food critic. I made a few mini changes. One is to crush 2c of the blueberries in the food processor. The second was to use 1 1/2 c of splenda and fat free/sugar free lemon jell-o as per another reviewer. Well this was right up my sister's alley considering she watches her sugar intake and I only used 1 box of jell-o which is only a 0.30 not the 3oz that is suggested in the recipe. She also said the texture was perfect and it jelled nicely. I did process this in a hot water bath after filling and sealing my jars. I only got 3 half pint jars from this recipe.....thanks!

Wow!!! This was super easy and delicious! I usually stick to a recipe for the first attempt, but after reading so many reviews about the sweetness, I used about 1 3/4 c sugar. It was plenty sweet, and I might even use a little less next time. (There will be a next time!) I also pureed half of the berries in a small processor. It was still really chunky, so I might do 3 cups pureed and 1 cup whole berries. I used 4 oz. jars, and this recipe filled 9 jars. I actually liked the subtle hint of lemon from the gelatin, but that would be an easy way to play with this recipe. I was planning on giving most of it away, because I knew my husband and I couldn't eat all of it. But after we ate an entire jar this morning, I'm reconsidering!

This recipe could not be any easier.  I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews about the lemon flavor being too overpowering, but did not find that to be the case.  The jam is delicious!!!  Will be making this again for sure.

Easy, delicious. I ran out of blueberries and threw in some strawberries, still fantastic. I used it as a filling in a lemon cake.

I am VERY disappointed that I doubled the batch and it only made 4 jars, I think with as much fruit and sugar as it takes it should at least yield a little more.. Not that its the recipe's fault the jam came out ok, not fabulous (a little to gelatin flavor for my taste) I am probably not going to make this jam again.

This was the easiest jam I've ever made!  I made some to give to some sick church members--one who had hardly been eating.  He went on & on about it.

I'm not a fan of lemon anything so I was a little worried. But, I followed the recipe exactly and this is possibly the best tasting jam i've ever had.  The flavors blend perfectly and does not taste like lemon.  The lemon jell-o definately compliments the blueberries flavor. This is a keeper. I'm making it again today actually!

I loved this jam! It couldn't be any easier to make either. If you like lemon you will enjoy this recipe it gave the blueberry a fresh lemon taste. I chopped all 4 cups of my berries. This spreads perfect even on fresh bread. THIS IS A KEEPER!

Great recipe.  I used a strawberry/blueberry mix as I am not a lemon fan, and it came out very yummie.  I also used the splenda sugar blend to replace the sugar and the set is perfect and taste is excellent.

made this for Christmas gifts for friends.  It was very good, my daughter eats it on her bagel every morning!  I did cut way back on the sugar,  I don't even think you could tell.  I also used my immersian blender to make the jam smoother.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is that after a few days, the consistency was sorta different.  I was nervous my friends would be turned off by that. But I told everyone that this is not officially "canned" jam and the jello is the thickener so it acts more like jello, but tastes wonderful!

Using the lemon jello made this much less intimidating for my first try at jam.  This jam was far better weeks after I made it than right at the beginning, as the blueberry flavor seemed to come out more while the citrus-y lemon flavor seemed to recede some.  As-is, it was a bit too sweet for me, so I may back off the sugar some next time.

Went blueberry picking on a co-workers farm and came home with over 5 cups of fresh berries.  After realizing we could not eat all the berries before they started getting mushy and fuzzy, I search for a jam recipe.  This recipe was super easy and amazingly delicious.  I cut back on the sugar to just 1 cup,  crushed all the berries and everyone loved it.  I highly recommend trying this recipe!!!

The perfect recipe for "small batch" jam!  I had a lot of blueberries on hand, thanks to great sales at the store, and I picked up some black raspberries and local strawberries at a local farm stand.  This recipe was perfect for preserving what was too much for just me to eat out of hand!

I would have given this 5 stars but to me, the use of geletin is unacceptable for any canning recipe.  It has poison in it.  The alternative is a talblespoon or two of fresh lemon juice.  I used lemon juice and it's a good recipe.  I double the recipe and came out with 7 - one half pints of jam.

I don't understand how this recipe has received so many good reviews.  If you follow the recipe exactly, you will be very disappointed.  Don't use lemon flavor (cherry might work better).  Don't leave any berries uncrushed and let it simmer for an hour or so.  Recipe says "bring to a boil and remove from heat."  If you do that, you'll end up with exactly what you made: boiled blueberries, not a jam.

I really liked the flavor of this jelly.  Next time I will send it through the food processor like others suggested to give it a smooth texture and I might add the pectin to make it a little firmer although you don't necessarily need it.  Very nice.

So easy, so good. Didn't have lemon gelatin so I used orange and it was wonderful. Friends could not believe it when I told them how simple and quick it was to make.

Another winning recipe I've used from this website! It's so easy, but it does taste like I've been slaving at the stove for hours. The taste is awesome! I'm going to go put on a loaf of Amish Bread in the breadmaker and set the timer so I can have this with the bread in the morning. YUMMMMMMY!

I don't think there is a way to mess this one up - it's sooo easy and yummy.  I only had one pkg. of lemon jello so I just used one pkg. of plain pectin as a substitute.  I also doubled it and it worked great.

I was so nervous to use this recipe but I followed it as stated except I did use the food processor on 3 c. blueberries otherwise it would've been whole blueberry jam.  It is really runny like jello at first but it all works out in the end product.  This is delicious!

Absolutely wonderful and so easy.  It set up very well.  My 6 year-old helped me make it, and he loved having it on his PBJ sandwich the next day.  I think you could use a little less sugar, but that would depend on your berries.  I used the whole 2 cups and didn't think it was too sweet.

Good with the lemon flavor, but turned out runny.  I had to add more pectin but did not get it all stirred in enough & ended up with some gelatin lumps.

Very nice and easy recipe. I like it because its not super lemony its just perfect.  Definitely a keeper.
