I am only giving it four stars because I have a few suggestions that I think would make it a five star recipe.  First I added a peeled and cubed potato and 1/4 cup cream.  Then I blended it with the smoothie blender.  It comes out very creamy with a nice thickness to it because of the pureed potato.  I also might use vegetable broth instead of chicken next time.

This is some of the best soup I've ever had in my life. I LOVE soup so I don't say this lightly!! Easy to prepare and ready fast. The only change I made was adding a little bit extra garlic and fresh basil (use 2xs as much). SO SO SO GOOD I am fighting myself to not eat it all!***Edit*** I also like to top this with croutons and fresh parmesan cheese. It's also very good if you put it in a blender (I use a hand blender) and puree it with a bit of cream. Just be sure to remove the bay leaf! One last thing, I always make this with (gasp) canned tomatoes!

Made this for dinner picture tonight. Big hit with the famiy, however I adapted to my tastes and ingredients on hand. I used fresh tomato and herbs (basil, oregano & parsley). I peeled and seeded the tomatoes.  I added a bit of feta and blended it smooth with the immersion blender. Also used more wine and subbed tomato juice for some of the broth. Also used honey instead of sugar. (processed sugar bad).

That this recipe is low-calorie and low-fat is a bonus. This is one soup I would prepare even if healthy eating wasn't a concern. It is perfectly constructed, nothing you would find out of a can. This one goes into my favorites and no doubt will be one I will remember for the rest of my life. I wouldn't change a thing. It's perfect.

Very simple and tasty soup to accompany some warm crusty bread and a salad.  I used sake in place of white wine because I was out, and the flavor was fine.  I also added some salt (for the tomatoes), milk (or soy milk - for a bit of a thicker consistancy) and chopped zucchini, squash and carrots (for a more substantial "bite").  Everyone loved the "spice" aftertaste.  Wonderful!

Very easy to make and has good flavor. I added salt and pepper. I also pureed the soup in batches to make it thicker. I will make it again.

Great tomato soup recipe.  The spices give it that "grown-up" flavor missing from the old standard can.  I used a hand smoothie blender to puree the tomatoes at the end of cooking to give it a thicker, heartier quality.  It was great!

While this is not the yummiest  tomato soup, made as is, it is definately the lowest calorie tomato soup and still tasty. Worth making for sure.

It had a good flavor, but I didn't love it... definitely more sauce-y than soup-y.

Even though I put diced potato in it (per another review), it was still pretty thin and way saltier than I expected - maybe dilute your broth or use a low-sodium variety.

Cheers!

This is a perfect soup--just don't follow the advice of the reviewer who wants you to add cream.  That makes it an entirely different, less tomato-tasting soup, not to mention more than doubling the calories and adding fat.  Why would you do that to a recipe that's awesome the way it is: light, tangy, delicious.  Mess with the herbs if you want, but trust me on the cream.  I make this all the time, quick and easy, from tomatoes we froze in the fall.

Pretty good.  As others noted, it isn't a thick based tomato basil soup, but it is good nonetheless.  I actually made this twice within a matter of days, it was so easy and I had extra tomatoes on hand.  The second time, I did try to thicken it with flour and succeeded to a limited extent.  What I liked about this recipe is that I can get all the ingredients (I live in Germany), and I don't need lots of kitchen equipment (i.e. an oven or blender), and it tasted good!

I am vegan so I used vegetable broth and I didn't use any oil so it was fat free. I also use fresh herbs whenever possible.

Still one of my absolute favorite soups - I make this all the time, whether I'm watching my weight or not (made it tonight, in fact!) My family loves it too and asks for it often.  

The key is blending the soup before serving it.  It gives it that creamy consistency without adding the fat and calories of cream.

My husband and I love this.  I have made it many times and made some changes along the way.  I use more garlic and basil, about twice as much.  I add blue cheese or feta cheese at the end and then use my immersion blender to make it smooth and creamy.  I have even added some smoked chicken we had in the freezer to it.  Serve with some crusty bread and you have a wonderful, comforting meal.  I suggest doubling the recipe and then freezing it in individual servings.

My husband, who likes tomatoes more than me, made this recipe for dinner last night, and these comments come from him. ... I was hoping for something with a bit of body and with a bit more tomato flavor.  What I got was something sort of brothy and non-descript--hardly savory and barely more than chicken broth seasoned with a hint of tomato and a hint of other spices.  In fact, basil was barely discernable.  I added corn starch to thicken the soup to a tolerable level, and with enough crackers, we ate it, but I'll be looking for a different version which tastes more like tomatoes and less like something from a can.

It is thin, almost water-ey, even with blending, it still had a thin, tomato sauce-like consistency.  The bigger issue for me was the lack of deep, rich tomato flavor.

This was really good but I did have to add a couple things.  As a garnish I added avocado and sour cream.  The directions should be written with more steps so that it is easier to read.  I didn't have any marjoram so I left that out.

I prefer a non-creamy tomato soup so this was perfect for me.  I added finely chopped yellow and orange bell peppers and it gave the soup a tiny sweetness.  I also blended it all up at the end to make it a more smooth soup.  We had Reuben sandwiches with it and I brought leftovers the next day to work.  Will be making this again and again.

I had never had tomato soup before because it just didn't sound good.  But this soup is really great. I used a can of diced tomatoes, and I added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a tablespoon of sugar.  My husband even loved this soup and he doesn't really like tomatoes.

I hate to be the one bad review, but I thought this tasted like watered down spaghetti sauce.  As spaghetti sauce it was really good (I strained it and used it as such last night--my family loved it).  As a soup, not so good.

I followed the recipe exactly but added some chopped clams the last few minutes of cooking. My husband and kids loved it especially since the tomatos and basil and oregeneo came from our garden.

This soup was such a surprise! I am a huge fan of tomato soup (especially with rice in it--not sure why that was such a childhood staple). I have had a few very flat-tasting homemade versions, but this was is great. I liked the way the spices tasted--which is often not the case when it isn't something super standard, like cumin in Mexican food.

This is excellent served with grilled cheese or rice pilaf.

This was ok. Didn't taste like the thick tomato basil soup that I am used to.

The soup was a little to thick and actually made a great sauce for pasta. I originally used it with some homemade Italian soup  bread bowls. Very tasty

This was my first try at home made soup. It was out of this world. Restaurant quality flavor. My wife raved about it, I loved it. Fantastic. Can't wait to make it again.

We tried this tonight.  Excellent.  I changed the recipe slightly to get more veggies and taste.  I put in 3 cloves of garlic and a 1/4 cup of finely minced baby carrots. Since half of my family likes cream of tomato soup and half does not I added about a 1/4 cup of milk to those who liked creamy soup. I tasted the soup both ways and loved it.  We loved it so much that we are going to the store to buy more tomatoes and will used up the last of the basil from my garden to freeze some soup. YUM!! My pickiest child had two helpings!

When I found this recipe, I was in one of those moods where I wanted to make it right away...But on checking, I never had all the ingredients.
I substituted the fresh tomatoes for a bottle of passata and a tin of chopped tomatoes and a spoonful of tomato puree. I had dried herbs but I decided to add the fresh basil on it's own.
It made enough for 6-8 people and everyone said it was fantastic and full of flavour.
Thanks for posting.

This was a great lite soup. I used veggie broth because my daughter is a veg. My kids, who do not even eat sauce on there pasta, ate this with crutons. So easy to make! Will be making this again.

I make this soup often. It's easy and always a winner. I usually add more tomatoes and sometimes throw in canelini beans and wilted spinach.

Totally delicious recipe! I did change one small thing about this recipe when I made it... my family doesn’t really care for chunky tomato soup, so I blended mine until it was smooth & creamy. But definitely a big hit for my family!

Wonderful soup! I did make one change though. I didn’t have any tomato paste, so I used a small can of tomato sauce instead. Simmered it for 30 minutes, then placed it in the slow cooker for another 3 hours. I served it with a grilled cheese sandwich. Perfect dinner

The result tasted more like a pizza sauce than a traditional tomato basil soup.  It was good, but unexpected.  Probably will not make it again.

Had leftover tomato paste and looked for a recipe to use it up. What a find!!!  Was wonderful. Made according to the recipe but used my own vegetable stock and added chicken soup base. Great flavor and so easy to make.

Awesome Recipe!! Made this last Christmas as an apetizer for a large family dinner.  Everyone raved on and on about this soup.  We  were able to enjoy this soup for the next several days and it was even better the longer it was in the frig.  You can definitely make this soup ahead of time and keep in refrigerator till your dinner.

This soup is delicious.  Like everyone else, I made a few changes.  I sauted the onion and 2 cloves garlic in a little olive oil.  Then added the tomatoes and broth and simmered 20 minutes, and then added some fresh basil.  I used a blender to liquefy about half of the mixture, and left the rest chunky.  I followed the rest of the recipe as it read.  I did not use cloves.  The final product is very fresh and tasty.

I didn't have fresh basil so this recipe was a life saver.  Family loved it and asked for 2nd's.  I used my little chopper machine to save time.

This is the second tomato soup I tried on here. The first one had cream and it was good, this one doesn't and it is fantastic. The cream dilutes the flavors of the basil and garlic, which I love. Can't wait to try with fresh basil!

I love making this with my boyfriend! The first time I made it, I couldn't really taste the tomato or the other spices over the basil, so I usually cut the amount of basil in half and don't let it simmer as long. Other than that, this soup goes wonderfully with a sliced Italian bread and olive oil.

Added salt and pepper and a little cream at the end. Kids liked it but like the stuff out of a can better.
