Doesn't get much easier than this. I sprayed an empty ice cube tray with cooking spray. Easy removal - twist and pop out. I would think a mini muffin tin would also work, too. Thanks for the recipe!

Rock on!! How can you go wrong with dark chocolate and toasted almonds? You can't. Period.
PS. I suggest using moulds. I tried with and without and freeform just made a mess.

Simple and delicious! I LOVED the flavor of the roasted almonds with the chocolate (I used milk chocolate b/c that's all I had on hand). This is going into my regular candy rotation and I could totally see adding some coconut to this as well...a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow, what a good recipe - so easy and delicious.  I didn't have the dark chocolate required so I used what I had, which was a mix of pure chocolate baking squares: bittersweet, semi-sweet and unsweetened. I waited a few minutes for the mixture to cool slightly so that they would keep a nice shape on the waxed paper. The only change I'd make next time is to increase the ratio of almonds to chocolate as the last few flattened out more because they had less nuts in them.   They made a nice hostess gift ; I will surely make these again.
