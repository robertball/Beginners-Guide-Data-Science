Excellent recipe! I added basil, parsley and a little oregano.I let everything simmer in the pan for 30 minutes, then added some flour to make a gravy... WHICH WAS FABULOUS!! I also cut the chicken into halves. It was EXCELLENT! We will definately have this dish again!!

This is a good recipe. I have made this for years. I do it a bit differently. For step one use the same seasonings with a little flour to coat the chicken, and saute the breasts till golden. I remove the chicken to a plate. In the skillet, saute the mushrooms till tender. Then add 1C chicken broth, 1/3 C Marsalla wine. Simmer, scraping up any bits in the pan. Return the chicken and simmer till heated through. I top it with the cheese, put a lid on to melt it, then serve with linguini or a rice pilaf. Ladle the sauce with mushrooms over the cheese topped chicken It is a great variation.  The recipe as is, is very flavorful, and with the light flavor of the wine sauce can really add to it.
***KimasWeiss**** I prefer this in the oven too. Follow the 1st step browning the seasoned & floured chicken. when done, put it in a baking dish. In the skillet saute mushrooms, onion if you like, then add the broth/wine and let it simmer till reduced about 1/4. Pour over the chicken and top with cheese.  25 mins @ 350 and your set.

I added one onion (cook this before adding mushrooms) with the mushrooms. I also added a clove of garlic to this and salt and peppered it. Turns out better with a combination of EVOO and butter/margarine. After the mushrooms and onions are somewhat cooked I added the chicken.  Make sure you don't overcook the chicken! I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper as well. Eyeball the cheese and sprinkle the cheese directly into the pan so it melts. Serve from the pan. I eat it with steamed white rice.  Yum!

I thought this was very tasty and easy.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added fresh basil and parsley. I think that really made a difference.

This was a huge hit. I made quite q few changes though. 1) I put 1/4 cup flour in a zip lock bag along with oregeno, parsely, basil, onion powder, garlic powder, garlic salt and black pepper. 2) I shook each piece of chicken in the bag to fully coat. 3) while the chicken was cooking for the first 12 minutes, I saut√©d  the mushrooms along with chopped onion and garlic.   I will be cooking this again.

Flattened the chicken breasts thin and then sauteed them in an olive oil/butter combination. Added more sliced mushrooms. Two cups of mozzarella cheese for two chicken breasts is ridiculous! Just eyeballed the amount that I thought would be appropriate.

For a general meal, it's 4 stars- enjoyable but not the end all be all.  But for a quick, easy meal- 5 stars.  I added basil & oregano to the chicken seasonings.  I used a 1.5 TB which was plenty.  Definitely don't cook the chicken that long unless you have massively thick chicken.  I did 3 mins/side and kept checking it.

excellent!!! what a great dish! I added the basil, and parsley as previously suggested, plus the wine. I also added dried, chopped onion. Oh yummy! It makes a sorta sauce that is delicious served over the chicken. I used canned mushrooms, cause I didn't have fresh and it was just great! I also added pepper, and salt.

Quick, easy, and yummy.  (We threw in a little wine for a bit of added flavor)  We, too, will be doing this again.

This had absolutely no flavor! I even added extra garlic and some spices, but I think the juices from the chicken dilute the potency and flavor of the spices. I will not be making this again.

I thought this was great! I cooked the garlic when I heated the oil, not when I added the chicken, and I added some thyme and rosemary. Also, I omitted the mozzarella and used some shredded parmesan instead. :)

I give this one of my rare 5-star ratings. Not because it's necessarily the best dish ever, but the combination of easiness to make, fresh ingredients, and awesome taste put it right up there. I made it exactly as written (using several small garlic cloves to approximate one normal-sized clove). If I must quibble a little, this isn't the quickest dish to prepare, and might be a little too heavy on the garlic powder. Also, depending on how big the chicken breast halves are, the amounts of cheese and mushrooms might be a little too much. But those are minor items - overall, the fact that such a great-tasting dish came from so few ingredients quite surprised me, and I enjoyed this for two consecutive dinners. I can highly recommend this recipe- thanks!

to slicenbake, who thought it tasteless.  try brining the chicken breasts or marinating them first to awaken  your taste buds. with garlic and other spices along with mushrooms and melted cheese. some ground pepper helps too, use white pepper. this appears to be a mild dinner that a glass of rose' or chardonney would compliment. very good.  a break from traditional fried/baked or bbq chicken.  refreshing dinner for two.

Just a heads up, this recipe tells you to cook boneless chicken breasts for 12 minutes on each side! I promise that if you do it will taste like a piece of drift wood and not chicken. Cook for 5 minutes each side, they will be perfect.

The recipie, as written, is good but bland. Adding basil & oregano definitely livened it up and took it from so/so to very good. We'll be having this again.

What a nice, simple, easy recipe.  After only 2 days in the fridge, my "fresh" mushrooms went bad so I had to turn to canned.  Also panfried my chicken in panko crumbs (yum!).  Will be using this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

OK...first off, the first time i tried this recipe,I followed a reviewer's suggestion of baking in the oven, adding chicken broth, etc...It was horrible! So, I just retried following the exact recipe to a tee, and it was wonderful! Husband even made a comment on how delish, which is nice.So, what I have learned is to follow the printed recipe! This one is going into the rotation just the way it is.... I gave it 4 stars, as it does take awhile to prepare.

I made changes as well and it was outstanding!  Cook chicken in chicken broth, oregano, basil, parsley and garlic.  Remove chicken when done. To the sauce, add mushrooms, a bit of flour to thicken and chopped capers (about 10).  Now sprinkle cooked chicken with parmesan cheese and broil.  Pour sauce over chicken and serve on a bed of plain spaghetti!

Not sure if this is really a review as much as this is what I did kind of thing.  I added basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary, as well as some seasoning salt.  Rubbed that into the chicken, then grilled it, as well as grilling the mushrooms and an onion.  When the chicken was done, I put it all onto foil, and topped it with the mushrooms and onions, then topped with about 1/2 cup of cheese, instead of the 2 cups.  Just as good, but much fewer calories.  It was soooo good!

Definitely add salt & pepper to taste. Basil, garlic & wine enhance the flavor and sauteing the mushrooms first is better. 1 cup of cheese is plenty for 2 breasts. I used half mozzarella & half sharp cheddar. I also marinated the chicken in Mojo for 2 hours first. Yum!

This was good but was missing something... I followed other reviewer's suggestions by adding some basil, oregano, LOTS of garlic, and reduced the amount of cheese. Still, I thought it was missing something. I don't keep wine on hand, but I might try some marsala wine next time (seems appropriate with the recipe) or will deglaze the pan with some vermouth (keeps well for those who don't keep wine in the house).

My husband and I loved this recipe. I didn't have garlic powder so I used more cloves of garlic. My husband and I love garlic. I fell short of the 2 cups of cheese but it was still smothered in cheese. I even made 3 chicken breast and it was still more than enough. I will make this dish again. I thought it tasted like something from a restraunt.

I added some white wine to this, as well as a little squeeze of Dijon Mustatd. The flavours went really well. Nice and mild. I served it over rice. :)

Followed the exact recipe last night and I am in love!! This dish was incredible, to me. Served it with cheesy potatoes. I even had a second helping because it was so good and regretted it afterwards haha. I will definitely be making this a lot.

I made with Morningstar Farm  veggie chicken strips, turned out pretty good. I almost think it's missing a hint of sweetness, though.

Very easy, very quick--and very good! Just what I needed for a fast weeknight meal. I marinated my chicken breast halves in red wine, seasoned them with salt+pepper before dredging in flour, and seasoned them with sage, thyme, and basil while they cooked. Serving with white rice as another member suggested is a good idea.

I thought this was very good and very easy to make. I did add some onion and sauted with the mushrooms. I didn't use the full 2 c. of mozz cheese either but thought it didn't need that much. Flavor was good and definitely an easy weekday meal over rice.

This was very tasty. I love mozzarella cheese, but I think the next time I would cut back some. For two people it was a little too much.

I loved this recipe it was so simple to make. I did think that 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, is a little to much, maybe 1-1.5 cups would have been better.

Could be better - Before frying the chicken I coated it in egg and bread crumbs and set aside. Before putting the mushrooms on top I added a table spoon of Mayo, then mushrooms and than a nacho cheese mix which is sharper! When the nacho cheese and mayo melt...mmm delish!!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I seasoned flour with garlic powder, oregano, basil, salt and pepper and lightly dredged the chicken breasts in the flour mixture before cooking in butter and olive oil.  After sauteeing the mushrooms, I removed them from the skillet and added 1/2 cup white wine and 1 tbsp. chicken bouillon crystals.  I returned the chicken to the skillet, melted the cheese and spooned the mushrooms on top when serving.  Delicious!

I took the advice of other members and added about 2 Tbsp white wine and added a couple pinches of parsley and oregano.  1 cup of cheese per chicken was way too much.  I took the drippings from the chicken and added chicken broth and a little cornstarch to make a gravy.  I then cooked the mushrooms in that sauce.  I thought with the extra stuff it was ok and my fiance was less than enthused.  The kids didn't care for it either.  It started out smelling great though.  Without the gravy it would have been very bland.

We thought this was bland. The mushrooms didn't stand out enough, and the cheese stuck to the mushrooms and made the whole top slide off in 1 big chunk with every bite.

Very good, way too much cheese though, I think one could get away with about half the cheese or less if wanted.

This was delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit also, following what Ms. Gayle did and added just a few steps. I coated the breast with a little bit of flour, which I added the garlic powder and italian seasoning to. I put the flour mixture into a ziploc bag and shook the chicken in the bag until coated. I cooked the chicken breasts for 10 minutes on each side in the olive oil, along with minced garlic. I then removed the chicken, and put into a dish and placed in a low temp oven to keep them warm. I then added the mushrooms and a cut up onion and sauted them until soft. I added a half cup of red wine, and a cup of chicken broth to the mushrooms and onion and scraped the pan to get up all the bits. Letting the mushrooms and onions simmer for a bit, I took 2 tbls of cornstarch and added a bit of water to the cornstarch. Once the cornstarch was dissolved, I added it to the mushroom mixture, turned up the temperature until the sauce was bubbling and stirring until it formed a nice gravy consistency. I added the chicken breasts to the pan with the mushrroms and onions, topped the chicken with mozzarella cheese, covered the pan and continued to cook the chicken until it was done, which was only another 15 minutes. I served the chicken with my favorite side of veggies and poured the mushrooms and onions with sauce on top of the chicken. Superb tasting. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy. I'd recommend using another pan to saute the mushrooms while you're cooking the chicken, then just dumping the mushrooms on top, putting sliced cheese on then covering.

I loved this recipe!  The only change I made was to use Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic instead of garlic powder.  It has a mixture of herbs that I don't have to measure or think about!  My family and I use this recipe often!

This recipe rated a "Delicious" from my husband, which I don't hear very often!  :-)  It was super, super easy and the results were very flavorful and moist chicken. I did reduce the garlic powder to only 1/2 TBSP.  In addition to the one clove of minced garlic, it was more than enough garlic flavor.  I also added 1 TBSP. of dried onion, which was very good. I definitely recommend this recipe!!

I cooked this dish last night. It was very simple to make. added onions to the mushroom mixture. It had a good flavor, but I would have added some basil had I had any.... would definitely fix this again.

My whole family loved this chicken!  Even my 5 year old son who won't try anything new asked for seconds and thirds!

I added fresh garlic, chives, fresh diced tomatoes, and lots of basil.  It was still missing a little something, though very very good.  I think next time I'll follow others' advice and add a splash of wine.  Yummy!

This was excellent! I used all fresh chopped garlic and threw in a couple ounces of red wine. Yumm. I also cut the cheese in half which seemed about right.
Good with rice, potatoes or pasta.

It was very delicious!  I used the same recipe and cooked 4 chicken breasts and still had a little cheese left.  I also added a small amount of white wine (2 tablespoons) while cooking the chicken in the olive oil and fresh garlic.

I thought this needed more seasoning (take previous reviewer's suggestions of herbs and add salt too).  Doubled all ingredients except oil and mozz. cheese.  1C of cheese per person is insane!!!
