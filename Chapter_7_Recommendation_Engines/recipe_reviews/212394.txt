This was the gruesome hit of our Allrecipes pre-Halloween party. One of my co-workers scooped out an eyeball right away and ate it. Sick. The cheese mixture was exactly the right amount for the mask, and it firmed up nicely and held its shape. And it tasted really good! Tips: 1) It's tricky to position the olives so they don't get all wonky when you add the cheese filling. Next time, I might add them afterwards. 2) I used the edge of a spoon to emphasize the outline of the lips. I think that made it extra life-like. 3) The next time I make this, I might download a photo of the musculature of the face, and try to copy that with the prosciutto. Because that's how I roll. 4) This isn't just for Halloween; how about a Game of Thrones or Walking Dead viewing party?

Made this for an appy before dinner tonight and everyone LOVED it! I used our favorite cheese ball recipe: 'Herman Reunion Cheese Ball' fron this site. I used black olives for the eyes too, b/c that's what I had on hand. This was super simple and turned out really cool looking (I wish the lighting was better b/c my pic does not do this justice). Awesome concept, and something that I would've never thought of...This is definitely gonna be a new Halloween staple in my house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was super easy and a HUGE hit. I took it to a Halloween party and everyone was commenting and taking pictures of it. I did use a different cheese ball recipe though. Only because I did not have all the ingredients on hand. So I used 3 cream of cheese, 3 tbl (1 oz)dry ranch dressing mix, 3 cups sharp cheddar, 1/4 c real bacon bits and black olives for eyes. Extremely tasty and easy! 
PS: I did watch the video. Also my face had already been cut into, so his chin is missing ;0

Amazing!! I brought this to a Halloween party and EVERYONE was taking pics of it and asking who made it. No one wanted to cut into it to "ruin" it! This was a huge hit!  I put toothpicks into the olives while I packed the cheese in, so I could keep the olives straight. But...don't worry, you can straighten them out once it's flipped onto the plate. I also shaped the lips with a toothpick once it was flipped out of the mask because they didn't come out too well.   I combined the cheese ball part of the recipe with another dip mix. I put the cream cheese, green olives and cheddar into my food processor. I then added a packet of Cugino's "Garlic Schmarlic" dip mix. So delicious! People are still talking about it, and were posting pics all over social media!

Fun halloween dish. Super easy to make and customize. Literally any mask you find can be used and any cheese ball recipe you like will work. I made some changes with my cheese ball because I absolutely hate the taste of olives. I used the three cheeses listed but added a packet of green onion soup mix, minced garlic  and a little worcestshire sauce and it tasted pretty good. It was a hit at the party. I posted it and my sister just asked "Why?"

Was a huge hit at the party!! Everyone took pictures of it and was thoroughly impressed (tasted great too)! Similar to other recommendations, I added the eyes after I had flipped it onto the plate. That made it easier to place them. I set it out to get room temp for about 40 minutes before everyone ate into it. It was a perfect consistency by that point (otherwise this style dip is rather firm/thick right out of the fridge). Thank you for sharing this very creative idea for a recipe!

This was so easy to make and was the hit of my party.  I didn't use the cheese ball recipe, instead filled it with a spinach dip made with cream cheese.

This was awesomely easy to make and a total hit at the party!  I chose to use plastic 'ping-pong' eyes instead of the olives and I think it came out so great.  I just wasn't sure I could do a good enough job on the eyes so I decided not to.  Totally lifelike!  I just carefully cut out the eye sockets and gently pushed the balls in and then used the 'skin' I cut away so line the eyes and make 'eyelids.'  Got a really great nice hard plastic mask from Michael's.  It's made by 'Creatology.' and it was very easy to work with.

Made this just for fun on Halloween and offered it to trick or treaters that came through... "human face or candy, your choice".  Was cute addition to our Halloween tradition! Only changes: I put the prosciutto on at the end, after molding the cheese in the mask so I had more control over final appearance.  Also chopped up roasted red pepper to use as brains.

We loved this for our adult Halloween costume party. Everyone laughed, took pictures and of course asked for the recipe. I live in a very small rural community and prosciutto is not available in my grocery store. I had to think of something else to use so I chose Buddig Beef. I cut it into strips and layered it on. It looked great!

This is a great Halloween party appetizer. It's not complicated but it is more difficult and time consuming than you'd think from watching the video. I used my food processor and my stand mixer to save time and my wrists,so it was pretty quick. I must note that some people were really intimidated by this dish, some didn't want to look at it and others were afraid to cut into it (they went for the eyes first). The presentation just gets more gruesome from there. Those who were brave enough to eat it loved it and took pictures of it.

Delicious and super easy. I put the prosciutto and olive eyes on at the end.  I used cream cheese, havarti, cheddar, roasted red peppers, olives and bacon bits in the cheese ball.

I think my mask was a little smaller than the original. Only used 2 packages of cream cheese, and half of the other cheeses. Really needed the mixer to combine the ingredients. Also added a teaspoon of pickled peppercorns for a little zing.
Everybody was impressed with the gross presentation, and it
tasted wonderful!

This is an amazing appetizer. EVERYONE at the party was amazed by it! Like others had mentioned, no one would eat it, so eventually, I took the first bite and then people did eat it. I did use my own cheeseball recipe, but this is an awesome presentation. This was our 11th annual Halloween party, and I will now make this every year from now on.

This was AMAZING!  I made it for a halloween party and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone wanted to know how I did it, and the following year I was asked to make it again. Get a basic mask - think "jason" and you are on your way. So so easy!

The cheese ball itself was pretty good but the presentation was phenomenal!  Super easy to make too.  I'll definitely make it again!  Instead of pimento I used black peppercorns for the pupils.  This was really fun to make and it garnered a lot of attention!  Thanks for sharing your recipe and creative side Tara!

I am giving 5 stars for the creative idea of using the face mask.  The cheeseball itself was a little bland.  It makes a lot, so I wouldn’t recommend this for a small party.  I also only used one 3-oz package of prosciutto, and I had one slice left (and I bought the bigger mask of the two sizes the store had).   I’m guessing it made about 3 cups of cheeseball mixture. It definitely was a conversation starter at the party!

Great idea for Halloween! The prosciutto I bought wasn't any good so I ended up using capocollo instead. It looks the same but tastes much better than prosciutto. Can't wait to see everyone's faces when they see this appetizer at the party!

I made this for a Halloween party and just like everyone has said, it was a huge hit.  Lots of pics. I followed the recipe except I added some roasted pistachios and almond flavored with cumin and chili powder. I also served with plain triscuits and baked crostinis with olive oil and curry. Delish.  5 stars.

This was a total hit at the Halloween party we attended.  The host was taking pictures and it was for sure a conversation piece throughout the night.  I personally didn't think it had a lot of flavor so next time I might make a different cheese dip.  There was quite a bit left over but will be used at bunko this week so it won't go to waste.

Total shock value! This is so creepy looking people can't wait to stick a knife in his eye. I used my own dip recipe (sorry) and made sure it was super chilled before removing from mold. I put his olive eyes in after removing from mold. Best Halloween idea ever!

This turned out awesome and so fun! I thought it was likely going to fail on me but I would give it a whirl and I'm glad I did. I used my own dip which wasn't a whole lot different from the recipe, just really stole the design concept. The only problem with it was that quite a few people were afraid to mess it up by slicing into it and a couple other weak bellied souls were just scared of it. I loved it!

Excellent idea! The results are truly gruesome. However, I would recommend 1 small change. I used it very very thin sliced corned beef which is more pliable and looks more like blue slash. Plus it's cheaper. I also used a different cheese ball recipe thats was a little more exciting.

This so creative. Everyone tonight asked me about it. I used the southern cheese ball recipe from this site. It looked so gross I could'nt get my 15 year old son to taste it. If I could give this 10 stars I would!! Great  idea!!!

This dish was so easy to make and came out incredibly creepy. When I brought it to our neighborhood Halloween party, the hostess moved her centerpiece and placed my dish in the center. I made it just as described, it took me 10 minutes flat to make it and it was the first dish that was gone at the party, Amazing recipe and one I'm going to make each year from now on! Thanks so much for the recipe. Wish I had taken a picture.

I made it and it did come out just as spooky as the picture.  However, I would recommend a different cream cheese mixture.  The dip on this recipe was extremely bland and not complementary to the prosciutto.  Next year I'll try the Homemade Chili dip in the round jar to mix with the cream cheese.

I made this for my mah Jongg group for Halloween and they loved it! It came out perfect. I did change the ingredients for the cheese ball b/c it sounded very bland. I used minced Kalamata olives, lots of minced scallions, minced fresh red pepper, roasted garlic, lots of freshly ground black pepper and a few dashes of Tabasco. It was delicious!

I made this for a Halloween party and it was a huge hit. I used Boars Head prosciutto, which was pricey, but delicious. Nobody wanted to be the first to cut into it, so I did, and then guests just kept digging in for more.  It does look like real muscle tissue!  It was so delicious too.  I did not use salt or pepper, which is optional. I used a hand mixer for the cheese, never my hands!

I made this for our VFW Halloween party. I won 1st prize. I used a scarier mask plus I used black olives for the eyes and almond slivers for the teeth. I also mixed in some dice jalapenos.

This was a huge hit at my Halloween Party. It was easy to make. I skipped the olives and used cream cheese,  cheddar jack and mozzarella. I think that's a way better combo.

Not only did it taste great, it was a big hit!  I'm a nurse and brought it to the hospital for our Halloween potluck.  I reduced the amount, used a taco shredded cheese mixture, diced chilies and diced red peppers, and coppa for the muscle tissue.  Such a fun and great tasting party appetizer!

This came out so cool. The hardest part about it was finding the mask. All of the stores had the plain white mask that stopped at the forehead but I found the correct one at AC Moore. The most important thing to remember about making the flesh is that you have to use proscuitto, not ham as I saw on another site. The proscuitto should be sliced super thin like authentic italian deli's do. Also, in addition to putting the initial blobs of cheese over the eyeballs, push the cheese mixture into the nose before filling the head the rest of the way. I made two of these and the first one had a flat nose that I had to play around with to get it to look right. The second one came out fantastic. They were a big hit at the parties. Lots of people taking pics on their phones. Unfortunately, nobody wanted to be the first to cut into it and ruin it so it sat for quite a while, untouched. You might have to be the first one to cut into it after all of the pictures are taken.

I am giving this a five star for presentation as it looked so awesomely gruesome on the table with blood red beet chips around it. I made it with plastic eyeballs instead of olives and followed a picture of  the structure of the muscles of the face for authenticity. Looked amazing!! The host of the party who is a doctor was super impressed.

Followed recipe pretty much exact, our mask had a mouth opening so we added roasted red peppers for the lips and bacon pieces for teeth. Was terribly disgusting looking but tasted great

Definitely 5 stars for creativity! Was super easy to make, I concentrated really hard on making sure that the nose and mouth were stuffed! Replaced eyes with black olives and made my own cheese ball (sorry, not a fan of olives). This was an absolute hit on Halloween party, maybe even too much- people wouldn’t eat the cheese ball just to preserve the face! Thank you, what a great idea!

Turned out amazing!! I used "best ever cheeseball" recipe. After doing some research I put the cheeseball mixture into the plastic wrap lined mask and let 'set' in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After putting the 'face' onto my platter, I added the olive eyes and prosciutto. I found this to be much easier than lining the mask with prosciutto. It also allowed me to make adjustments to the face before covering. Will definitely make again!!!

We made this for our walking dead dinner night. Everyone loved it. The only difference I did was used olives with garlic stuffed in them and used Virginia ham sliced real think for the skin. (it was cheaper) other than that great dish.

Use cocktail onions for eyes. Seriously, it's gross. Or peeled grapes. I actually made this in 2010 (obviously not from this recipe) using a cheese recipe that included reduced red wine... It was yummy and gnarley.
