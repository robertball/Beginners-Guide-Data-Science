These were really good.  To save a little time I use minced garlic in a jar and put it in a bowl with the olive oil then put it in the microwave for 45 sec.  instead of the oven.  I have done this on another recipe and it turns out great.  I made these for Thanksgiving and everybody loved them.  They taste just like some you get at a restaurant.

Ok, after making this side dish many times I have perfected it.  6 Cloves tossed in olive oil just to coat.  Into the broiler for a few mins., well just till they brown.  Meanwhile I peeled and cubed 6 medium potatoes.  Into boiling water for aprox. 15 - 20 mins OR until you stick a fork into the largest potatoe and it breaks only once.  I then drain and into a bowl.  I add approx. 2/3 cup of milk.  I then add pressed roasted garlic.  Don't worry about the left over larger pieces that are in the press.  The hand held mixer will beat it up.  Added a few minches of salt.  Then I added 3 tablespoons of marjorine.  Blend it well.  Last but not least I added a tablespoon of garlic spread marjorine.  OMG it was to die for!!!  WOW all around!!

First let me tell you what I didn't like about this recipe.  It tells you to cook the potatoes until "tender, but firm."  What does that mean???  It's not like I can reach my hand in a pot of simmer water and feel the potatoes!  So I guestimated 20 minutes.  It came out a little mushier than I like it, so I think a time range would have helped.  Also, there's not enough garlic cloves.  Not much garlic flavor to this garlic mashed potatoes.  I recommend doubling the garlic...probaly a whole head.  Also, 45 minutes cooking in olive oil is too much.  Cooked all the flavor away!  I think about 25 minutes would have sufficed.  And that's why I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars.  Now onto the good stuff.  I added 4 oz of cream cheese to the mix too to give it an extra creamy flavor and texture and cut back a little on the milk.  I also added some garlic salt (about a tablespoon) to compensate for the nonexistent garlic flavor.  I also spooned it into a baking dish, topped it with cheddar cheese and paprika and baked it for about 15 minutes on 350 degrees.  It came out pretty well after I compensated for the overdone potatoes and the nonexistent garlic flavor.

Different flavor for mash potatoes, but definitley good!  Did have to add additional butter and milk as the potatoes were quite dry as written....  For a unique twist add the small purple flower from the society garlic plant which is edible, gives color and a stronger garlic flavor!

Really great potatoes, but as stated, might be bland. I used 4 large russets, to start. Instead of roasting the garlic the way the recipe states, I used an entire head of garlic, chopped off the top so that some of the cloves were showing, placed it on foil, and drizzled it with olive oil. I then roasted the garlic for a half an hour at 350. I used twice the amount of butter and twice the Parmesean. I squeezed the entire head of garlic into the mash, and viola! Deliciousness.

I roasted a whole head of garlic (unpeeled, and then squeezed them out after they cooled) and used a mix of Yukon Golds and Reds....I prefer them over baking potatoes any day.  I also used whole milk (which I never do) and these potatoes were smashing!  Lol!  My only complaint is that I couldn't really taste the parm. cheese, so I may just leave that out next time.  Very tasty, light and fluffy taters.

Yum!  I roasted my garlic for 20 minutes in 1/2 the olive oil required (I thought that it was a bit much).  I also added nearly a cup of milk, (because we like them creamy).  Make sure you buy the larger garlic bulbs if you are looking for more garlic flavor, and maybe leave the skins on 1/2 of the potatoes as the previous reviewer suggested.  I put these in my crockpot to keep them warm and they were the perfect consistancy.  I got rave reviews on these!  Thanks Barrett!

Yeah, this recipe is a definite keeper.  It takes a little time--peeling potatoes and roasting the garlic, but the result is fabulous!  I almost got carried away with my "finger sampling" as I was mixing the potatoes.  I nearly added a few ingredients, one of which was going to be cream cheese; I had some leftover in the fridge.  But, I'm glad I didn't.  The recipe was just right, "as is."  If you are a garlic fanatic, you may want to add another clove, two or three.  I don't like *too much* garlic flavor, so it was just right for me--just enough for a pleasant garlic flavor.

These were really good.  The only problem I had was this...I roasted the garlic for only 30 minutes, and it burned to a crisp...I would really recommend cutting down the roasting time.  Since I didn't have any more fresh garlic, and it would have taken too long to roast some more anyway, I just used some minced garlic from a jar, and they turned out really yummy anyway.  Next time I'll roast the garlic for about 15-20 minutes and see what happens.

This is one of those basic recipes that you can personalize to fit the way you like your potatoes.  My family likes a little more garlic although we eat garlic with just about everything.  An easy dish for a beginning cook.  I agree with others on cutting way down on the roasting time for the garlic; 20 minutes should do it.  Thanks, Barrett.

This is a great recipe...I read a lot of reviews(as I always do) and some people complained of the garlic burning and not tasting the Parm.... Well, just use a whole head, cut the tip side of the head off exposing all of the tops of the garlic cloves. Make sure oven is preheated to 350. Put head into a piece of tin foil and put olive oil on top of the garlic. Just enough to cover the garlic and get on each clove. Put some salt and pepper on the head and wrap the garlic nice and tight with the foil. Throw that in the oven for 35-45 minutes and you are good. I like 35 minutes because it still leaves the garlic a little mashed.    I followed the recipes almost exactly except for adding probably at least 3/4 of a cup of Parm....Using the whole head gave me garlic in every bite and it wasn't overpowering with butter or anything else to give it flavor. You could really make this almost healthy if you used skim milk and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!(Which I did both). The cheese is the only killer and that's not terrible. I like lumpy potatoes so I mashed them with a hand masher leaving the skin on 3 of the 7 potatoes. All in all, I think I will make my mashed potatoes like this from now on!

I love this recipe.  The roasted garlic takes that strong flavor and really mellows it.  You do have to change the garlic, milk, and butter to suit your own tastes.  Thanks.

This gets 5 stars even though I don't roast the garlic. In a small frying pan I add appx 2 tsp of bacon fat and over a medium low fire I add 8 to 10 whole peeled garlic cloves, stirring frequently  til they have a medium brown color and are soft. To the water for the potatoes I always add 2 too 3 bay leaves, plenty of coarse ground black pepper and of course salt. I use russet potatoes only and scrub them well before cutting into boiling size pieces, never do I peel them. While the potatoes are boiling the garlic is browning and softening. When the potatoes are done and drained, bay leaves removed, they go back on a very low fire to remove excess moisture. To the pot with the potatoes I add salt, pepper, butter to taste (lots), sour cream instead of milk, Parmesan or cheeses of choice, and the browned garlic. I then mash them by hand using a curved heavy wire potato masher. They come out chunky with extra potato flavor and also have the flavor of the skin. A little milk can be added if they seem they need to be thinned a bit but more sour cream will have the same effect. I have been asked for this recipe so many times that I finally made several copies to keep on hand to give out when asked for it.

I appreciated that the garlic flavor was subtle and Hubs felt the same about the Parmesan.  Both could be increased without a problem if you wanted to oomph the flavor of either or both.

I know this is supposed to be an easy recipe but I am a little confused by the garlic part. I wonder if it was meant to have a little burnt taste/smell. Mine turned out a little dark brown half way through the cooking time.  We dont like the taste of burnt garlic so i squeezed out as much of the soft stuff.  When I roast garlic I usually use the whole bulb of garlic, leaving the first layer of skin on and cut 1/4 at the end, place in remiken, drizzle olive oil then cover with foil. Maybe next time I will use this method for the individual gloves leaving the skins on. When cooled, squeeze out the soft garlic. Now, let's get with the whole result...it was bland and had to add more butter, a little more shakes of salt, and used more heavy cream. With little tweaks, you got a winner.

These potatoes were so delicious! I roasted a whole head in the skins and was then able to squeeze the garlic out. I didn't have quite enough milk in the house, so I used sour cream to make up the difference. We all loved this recipe Barrett and we thank you for sharing with us!

This was a very yummy recipe. It reminded me of the garlic potatoes at Bennigan's. They were very garlicy, which both my husband and I loved. They were a little dry though; we had to double or triple the milk. I only left the garlic in for 25min and it was still to long. I would hate to see what it looked like after 45min. But I was pleased with the overall result. Thanks.

This is a good recipe.  The one thing I will say is that the cooking time on the garlic is off.  The recipe says to bake the garlic cloves for 45 minutes - even if you were baking an entire bulb of garlic it would not take that long.  The garlic will be browning after ten or fifteen minutes.  I recommend adding the milk and cheese as you see fit - the consistency of mashed potatoes is a matter of personal preference.

Overall quite good, I stuck to the recipe, but it could use MORE GARLIC. Next time I will probably double the garlic and add some cream cheese for extra warmth.

I made these for me and my friend for thanksgiving dinner last night with a few alternations. 

1.   I didnt have a whole garlic, just minced garlic in a jar. I put the equivalent amount (believe 1/2 tsp per clove) into a pan and drizzled extra virgin olive oil over, and let it cook until slightly golden. 

2.   I used red potatoes, I peeled 2/3's of the potatoes, and left the other 1/3 with skin on. 

3.   While potatoes were boiling, I cooked the milk, butter, a 1/4 tsp garlic powder (love garlic) and the golden minced garlic in a small sauce pan. Just let it warm up, and compensated an extra tbsp of milk for the milk that evaporated. When the potatoes were cooked and drained, poured milk mixture over potatoes and mashed. Had to use a mixer to fluff them up a bit. 

Looked great with the red potato peel!

Great recipe, I also made a few small changes.  I used heavy cream and heated it up, it does make a difference.  I used about 10 cloves of garlic and roasted for about 30 min.  After I mashed the potatoes, I then mashed the garlic and added that along with the rest except for the parm. cheese.  I transfered the potatoes to a oven proof dish and then sprinkled the parm cheese over the potatoes and baked for 15 min.  It was Scrumptious!!!

Wow! These were REALLY GOOD. A new holiday dinner staple. Like others, I used whipping cream instead of the milk (and maybe a bit more than it called for to make them extra creamy). Yummmmm! The real roasted garlic I think definitely added that extra yummy touch. Will make this again for special occasions!

This was a big hit with family and friends but make sure you dont over roast the garlic.  If the garlic gets too brown, it's hard to mix in the potatoes and it has a burnt flavor.  Take the garlic out of the oven when there's a slight touch of brown.

Sooooooooo good.  There's a nice garlic flavor here without over powering the potatoes.  The cheese blends in nicely.  I used my mom's traditional mashed potato method (mayo, butter, and milk), but added the seasoning suggested here.  It really adds great flavor to potatoes.

My husband thought these were too bland at first, then too garlic-y once I added the garlic in, but I thought they were wonderful. Perhaps he got a chunk of garlic - it was a bit challenging to really mash the garlic into the potatoes.

My husband went BONKERS over these.  He's been bragging to everyone about how fantastic they are; making me look like a real expert cook!  LOL.  They really are delicious.  I won't bother making anything but these in the future.  BTW...only put the garlic in the oven for 20 minutes.  Mine burned the first time around when I put it in for the 45 minutes.  They were hard as a rock!

This is a very tasty potato dish.  The idea of cooking the garlic in the oven is an excellent idea since it add tons of flavor to the mashed potatoes.  I followed the recipe as indicated with the exception that I didn't add salt or pepper and it turned out very good.  The idea of adding Parmesan cheese to the mashed potatoes is a very good one!  I will definitely make this dish again.

Tasty recipe. I did add more milk because we prefer creamier potatoes than I was getting. Maybe I used larger potatoes than the person who submitted this recipe. I also use a ricer rather than an electric mixer. I feel a ricer gives you much fluffier potatoes. I heated the milk and butter and added the roasted garlic to that mixture. After I riced the potatoes, I added the milk mixture and stirred. I made them about 2 hours before dinner and put them in a crock pot to stay warm. Worked great!!!

I also roasted the garlic in 1/2 the olive oil and for only 20 minutes.  After the poatoes were blended, I put them in a stoneware dish, topped them with a handful of shredded chesse (three-cheese blend) and broiled for about 5 minutes (just enough to brown the top).

This recipe for mashed potatoes is excellent. I agree with the other reviewers, you only need to roast your garlic for 15-20 minutes. I used a tad more garlic and it gave my mashed potatoes a nice hint of garlic. Using the electric mixer was not powerful enough to whip the potatoes. I suggest maybe buying a potatoe masher.

I really liked this recipe. I am a garlic freak, so I always use more and it still didn't seam garlic enough. So next time I will use even more. Also, I left a little of the peel on the red potatos, my guests really liked that, they felt like they were getting the fancy kind.  Also, next time I will put some green onions or chives in there as well to give them more taste. One thing I would recommend is to not whip them to much, I left mine with just a little bit chunk to them and they were great!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful! I didn't follow the recipe exactly--I used all of the ingredients and went by how it tasted. I roasted two heads of garlic and used one and a half of them (more than what the recipe calls for).

Wonderful recipe- 1st time I was able to make mashed potatoes that didn't turn into glue.  Substitued heavy whipping cream for milk and doubled the roasted garlic.  Placed garlic in tin foil and lots of olive oil and cooked at 400 for 30 minutes (baked in muffin pan).

I made these mashed potatoes but instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream, makes them more creamy. I agree with the others that says it needed more flavor, so roasting a whole head of garlic with olive oil for 25-30 min. @ 350, doubling the butter and the parmesan definitely makes a world of difference. I also added fresh basil or you can add fresh parsley for an added burst of flavor and color.

EXCELLENT!!  I used leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving.  I added a little bit of fresh chives for a little onion flavoring.  My guys went C.R.A.Z.Y. over them!!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I love mashed potatoes and your recipe is very nice.  However, I would reduce the cooking time just a tad.  It's going to take the new cook time to figure out when her/his potatoes are cooked to the degree of tenderness they are striving to obtain.  I suggest people experiment with timing. I like to stop my potatoes before the water gets cloudy or the potatoes fall apart when poked with a fork.  I never was one for timing things. LOL

Use the microwave method as previously mentioned to save time with the garlic.  I doubled the garlic, added a little garlic powder, and used a small container of onion and chive cream cheese spread.  Family LOVED IT!!

After reading all the positive reviews, I wonder if I did something wrong--the potatoes were grainy and dry, and I had to add twice the butter and milk the recipe calls for. Perhaps it's a matter of personal preference? But the amount of garlic and parmesan was perfect, and I appreciate this as a good basic recipe which I will modify in the future, particularly remembering to add 1 cup of milk and four tablespoons butter.

Yum! I like to keep the skins on, I like the taste and it makes the prep so much easier.  The garlic flavor was really mild so the next time I make them I'll throw in even more cloves.  We didn't have real parmesan so I just used the powdered stuff and I think that's fine for this recipe.  Oh also add some dried parsley flakes, it looks nice!

This is a wonderful base recipe! I doubled the garlic because...well, we love garlic and put it in the over for 25 minutes. I used a 5 pound bag of yukon gold potatoes (minus two that I dropped down the sink...oops!), and the taste and texture was just perfect. I mixed all of the ingredients besides potatoes ahead of time then added it slowly while I was mashing. I cooked the potatoes for about 20 minutes (this will vary, of course). I used a hand masher for a more Southern texture. I made these for Thanksgiving and got compliments from everyone, including my husband who doesn't like potatoes and my brother in law, who said these were very flavorful. These are a bit more time consuming than the old butter-and-milk standby, but definitely worth the extra effort. Thank you!

Very good.  I adjusted the quantities to work with the amount of potatoes I had.  I roasted whole garlic for the first time and it turned out great.  I added some cream cheese for richness.

I just couldn't justify turning the oven on to roast a couple of cloves of garlic.  I had to scale down the recipe because it is just my hubby and I, so I boiled the cloves in with the pots. It doesn't work.  I will try these again when I am putting something in the oven for dinner so I can roast the garlic.  Oh, I also tried to nuke them and that doesn't work either.  I hope this helped to let everyone know what not to do.  I'll be back with a true rating later.

Great side dish, but the garlic should only be roasted for half that time or at a lower temperature.  Turn them half way too so all the sides get the same treatment.  I added some sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.

a great switch off from reg. mashed potatoes.   i love roasted garlic and make mine by cutting off just the top of bulb.  place on square of foil, drizzle w/ EVOO and sprinkle w/ some sea salt.  wrap up and place in 325 oven for an hour. Squeeze into bowl.  boil potatoes.  drain, leaving a few TBSP of water and put in bowl w/ garlic.  I warmed the milk, omitted the cheese,  added some snipped chives and whipped these were yummy!!   a drizzle of butter is all you need!

Yummy, no gravy necessary. I recommend more garlic than 6 cloves, personal preference. Also, it only takes about 20 minutes to roast large cloves of garlic this way. Put them in a small casserole, drizzle with olive oil, and cover with aluminum foil. Remove from over after 20 minutes and let them sit covered with foil until they have cooled. They will be nice and soft without being overcooked.

Outstanding. I made this about 5 hours ahead of time for xmas and reheated in microwave and they did not taste starchy at all. I used a touch more garlic and buttermilk instead of regular milk. Everyone gobbled them down. This will become a standby to go with our xmas prime rib.

This was really good, I love garlic and potatoes, let me say as a garlic lover that 6 to 7 cloves is plenty. I used all ingredients and I really did'nt measure anything, just ajusted to the amount of potatoes I had. When all was mixed I tasted and they needed something, I had parsley flakes and oregano so I opted for the oregano, the potatoes really came alive and burst with flavor. Just a pinch so as not to overpower. REALLY GOOD!!!. I think next time to save on time, I will use the roasted garlic butter with herbs by (Land of Lakes) just to see if it is close to this end result. Oh well, I served with grilled ribeyes and fried cabbage, Thanks for this great recipe.

I make potatoes just like this and I notice people saying that the garlic would not mash up as well as they would like. It is very beneficial to use a garlic press that way you don't have the sticky outside and it will run through the potatoes better than whole cloves.

I highly recommend using yukon gold (yellow) potoates.  They give a much creamier result than regular baking potatoes.  I always use lowfat evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  If you do use regular milk, make sure it's not super cold from the fridge when you add it to the potatoes.  These are great!

Great potatoes. I used minced garlic in a jar, a couple spoons full, and just sprinkled the parm cheese in (didn't measure).  Turned out great.

This recipe is a classic recipe, I think.  If you are a true garlic lover though, I really recommend doubling the garlic.  Next time, I think I'll double the parmesian and butter, too!  (However, the amount shown is probably healthier for everyday use!)

Absolutely the best! I used a whole head of roasted garlic, and instead of milk, I used heavy whipping cream and some reserved water that the potatoes were boiled in. I also doubled the amount of butter. I found I had to use a lot more liquid than was called for to make the potatoes creamy. Used shredded parmesan instead of grated, and it came out wonderful! This is my new favorite mashed potatoes recipe!

This mashed potatoes are excellent with a little bit of tweaking.  Really, it is only worth about 4 stars as is.  The main problem is that it doesn't call for nearly enough garlic. I would at least double the amount of garlic.  I see that a lot of reviewers haven't taken the time to roast the cloves but I think that's an important part of the recipe.  It really adds a nice, mellow flavor to these potatoes that is unique.  We also like to add a teaspoon of crushed rosemary to give it a more complex flavor.  We think these mashed potatoes are excellent and make them all the time.

I love this recipe! I tripled the garlic and added 1/4 more milk..I used fat free lactaid milk and 1 tbsp of flour to make a "heavy" cream..although you can use coconut milk as well, but I didn't have any. I would make it again! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is such a great dish for late dinners when you don't have anything to cook.  Instead of the 6 cloves of garlic, I doubled it to 12.  Cause that's how we roll.

This was really good. I did not follow the recipe exactly because I only made a small portion but its hard to screw this up.  I would say that the cooking time for the garlic is WAY too long.  I only cooked the garlic for about 15 minutes.  Peeled garlic cooks fast.

These are sooo good!  I probably quadruple the amount of garlic though. Even then I sometimes still need to add a dash of garlic powder to get the garlic flavor I want.  I also always use red potatoes or Yukon Rose as they are a little sweeter and creamier.

These were so easy!  I skipped step 1 & 2 and just added the minced garlic from a can that I had on hand.  I prepped the potatoes the night before and just left them in a pot in the fridge and made sure they were covered with water (very important or they turn brown).  The next day I just changed the water and left them sitting on the stove until I was ready to put them on to boil.  So easy and so tasty!!!  We even left the skin on!

I think this is a good base recipe so I gave it four stars but I made several modifications. 
Instead of baking potatoes I use red potatoes. My family and I love the taste of these potatoes. 
I start off by peeling 9-10 red potatoes and then boiling them in a large pot for about 15 minutes. I find this amount of time provides the perfect amount of tenderness. While that in boiling I put a little olive oil and butter into a skillet and sauté 10-12 cloves of garlic as well as 3 sprigs of rosemary. When the potatoes are done boiling I place them into a large mixing bowl and add 1/2-3/4 pint of heavy whipping cream(whole milk works as well) as well as 2 tablespoons butter. I dump in the garlic and rosemary then use a hand masher to mix it together and add salt/pepper to taste.

I used the microwaving method to roast minced garlic. While this was much faster, it did not taste as good as roasted garlic. I also made the mistake of adding ALL the olive oil into the mash and this made the potatoes taste strongly of olive oil. The 3 stars are more for my performance than for the recipe as it stands. I will try again and follow the recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter (even adding exactly 1/2 t. salt and exactly 1/4 t. pepper, but they turned out very bland.  The garlic was barely noticable.  Also, they had a sort of greenish color... from the olive oil, I suppose.

A good solid recipe.  I tend to use twice as much garlic as is called for (but I'm a big fan of garlic).  Next time though, I will probably use less olive oil on the garlic when roasting it as it came out a bit too "crispy".

I made the recipes exactly as stated but left out the parmesan and added some garlic powder and some butter. My husband, who is a garlic lover, said I could have left out some garlic but I thought it was just the right amount. 
We had plenty of leftovers but the next day the potatoes tasted extremely bland.

I didn't roast my garlic because I made this last minute and had none on hand so I just used a few teaspoons of minced garlic in a jar. I followed everything else exactly the way the recipe lists and these turned out fantastic. THey are so easy but taste like they took a lot of time.

I really wanted these potatoes to be good, but they are definitely bland.  I nearly doubled the garlic and still couldn't taste it.  I think the 45 minutes is way too long to cook it.  I also probably tripled the cheese, and doubled the butter, salt, and pepper.  I just kept adding cheese and salt and pepper until they were good.  I only used a couple tablespoons of milk and wouldn't add any more.  
I like the idea of garlic and parm together, but I could have done it better myself by trial and error.

My personal variation on this recipe is to use at least 6 cloves of garlic and cook them quickly in the broiler. I also would steam the potatoes for about 20 minutes for better flavour and to preserve the vitamins.  I also like to use redskin potatoes with most of the skin left on.  I like my mashed potatoes lumpy.

Absolutely delicious! I actually made the recipe worse by slightly burning the garlic (I had no idea what roasting garlic meant) but the mashed potatoes are amazing. Add more cheese!

These were incredible. I was baking chicken at the time and the oven was set for 425, so instead of roasting the garlic for the potatoes, I sauted them in the olive oil instead. Even my pickiest eater loved them. Excellent!

These are pretty good! I agree that the cooking time on the garlic is too long - mine were borderline too brown. So, scale about 15 minutes off and they should be perfect. Other than that, pretty easy and has a good flavor.

Very good! i did change things a touch by not roasting my garlic, i had minced garlic in a jar, and sauted my garlic in the olive oile till it was a nice uniform brown, then used it from there.

These are soooo yummy and so easy! I roasted 6 large cloves of garlic and it gave these potatoes the perfect garlic flavor.  I could also taste the parmesan cheese.  All the flavors come together nicely. I will be making this again.

I'm rating this 5* because I followed the advise of doubling the garlic, adding cream cheese.  I made a 5lb bag potatoes and used a head of garlic - for the other beginners...cut off the top (the thinnest point) to expose all the garlic cloves then pour on the olive oil and bake for approx 20 min.  If you don't have a garlic roaster - use foil.  I found this hint useful. These were the best garlic mashed potatoes we ever had!

very good!  My husband said it was better then chili's and he loves their potatoes.  i used about 8 or 9 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of sour cream instead of the parmesan. Because we had this for chrismas dinner I made it ahead of time (like I do everything) and put it in the fridge.  I heated it in the oven for about 30 or 40 min (don't remember the temp) and then broiled it for about 3 min until golden brown. I then put some chedder cheese on it and let it melt.  My family LOVED it!!! 
Thanks so much

These are delicious!  I roasted the garlic, double the amount suggested, for 35 minutes and it was just right.  I will definitely try these with Yukon golds, as well as red-skinned potatoes.  I think any potato would work great.  Also, I doubled the amount of Parmesan, and after mashing everything together, I stirred in some shredded mozzarella, put it in a greased baking dish, sprinkled with bread crumbs, and baked for about 20 minutes at 350.  I also added a sprinkling of fresh chopped parsley for some color.  We were very sorry when they were all gone!

This is a very good recipe.  I added a few more potatoes since I was expecting some hungry boys over and 8 cloves of garlic.  I put the garlic in the oven for 45 min.  They were starting to carmelize!  I like this recipe because it's not loaded with butter which we are trying to cut down on   Skim milk was used along with 2 T of butter.  Outstanding recipe!  Thanks!

Mmm, these were soooo good!  I doubled the amount of garlic, because we love it and I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  They ended up a bit dry, so I added some extra milk until they were creamy.  Perfect for when you don't want to make gravy...it doesn't need it.  Will definitely make this again!

I've made this exactly from the original recipe and it was very bland and I needed much more butter and milk than the recipe suggested so I gave it 3 stars.. but this time I took other's suggestions, I took a whole head of garlic, cut off the top, put it in foil and drizzled it w/ olive oil, closed the foil tightly and baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 35 mins. When my potatoes where done I mashed them w/ the amount of milk and butter I normally would use and I added all the soft garlic and mashed w/ my beaters. The garlic was very soft and just squeezed right out of the head. This time I didn't use the cheese and it came out fine so I'll probably keep that out also. This came out AWSOME! Everyone LOVED these potatoes! Definatly worth 5 stars if you don't get hung up on the amount of ingredients the recipe calls for!

Excellent! I made this awhile back and love the roasted garlic flavor. I've never been a fan of garlic mashed potatoes due to the overpowering garlic, but this is just right. My only complaint? There are no leftovers!

I just made this recipe for my husband and I tonight to acommpany our main chicken dish. I doubled the garlic as several others had recommended and also reduced the amount of milk just slightly; I used fatfree milk which was fine. While the overall taste was good -not amazing, I would probably suggest  tripling the amount of garlic. It just didn't have enough garlic flavor which surprised me. We also love garlic. I would make it again but with more garlic!

These mashed potatoes were good, but not great.  I would definitely increase the amount of garlic next time and also find another way to spice them up.

As I'm not able to cook as often as I like due to scheduling issues, I've only made this twice, but has turned out great each time. My wife LOVES them. Only thing I change is I add about double the garlic (If you're a garlic lover, you'll want more than the recipe calls for.)

I had very high hopes for this recipe because it sounded like something I would love. Unfortunately I was not at all impressed it was bland and not tasty. Will not make it again.

These potatoes were fantastic! I used an entire head of garlic as we are garlic lovers and also because the baking potatoes I had were quite large. I added both milk and a little cream. The potatoes were so fluffy and they were delicious! I have a dinner party coming up in a couple of weeks. I will definitely makes this dish again then!

This recipe could be improved, but makes a good, light dish that does well without gravy.

As written, the garlic may burn and the potatoes will be thick. We added extra garlic for more flavor, used less olive oil and increased the butter and milk. 2 tbs of  butter for 4 lbs of potato may be less than you are used to. We also added minced fresh parsley; it went well with the garlic and freshly-grated cheese. Roast the garlic for under 20 minutes; the potatoes should cook about that long if you like them creamy.

If we make gravy next time we might cut out the parmesan cheese and herbs or try a different recipe, but this dish help up well by itself. We will make it again on occasion.

Very good.  I took another reviewers advice and used minced garlic from a jar and placed it in a bowl with the olive oil.  Microwaved for 45 seconds and the taste was very good. (Thanks googles111 - saved on a lot of time)  Will make again.  Thanks

Like many before me, I had to "tweak" to make these them moist to my specifications.  Added some heavy cream, sour cream and more cheese (hey, it was for thanksgiving!  the calories don't count on holidays).  I could have eaten the whole thing and skipped the turkey.  
As a note for people bringing to potlucks, I made the day before and reheated in a casserole dish @325 degrees for 30 mins in a toaster oven; worked great!

Excellent flavor but my family didn't like the fact that the garlic cloves didn't mash into the potatoes. Next time I'd throw the garlic cloves in the boiling water to make them softer and easier to mash.

Good recipe as a starting point. I got so carried away I added sour cream and a little cream cheese. Turned out really well, I love creamy potatoes! Didn't have any fresh garlic so, I took 2 heaping tablespoons of already chopped garlic, put it in some foil with the oil drizzled on top at 350 for 15 minutes and into the mix it went.

I didn't use as much roasted garlic with this recipe because it tends to stick with me for too long, but it was still REALLY delicious! I used heavy cream instead of milk, a little more parmesan, and these potatoes turned out wonderfully. They were creamy and they went well with grilled salmon.

I made these with the Cola Pot Roast II also from this site and they were just OK.  I think they lacked a flavor I'm just not sure what.  I would cook the potatoes until completely tender and not leave a little firm like the recipe stated.

These potatoes were good, but only if you read the reviews first and make edits. First of all, 45 minutes was way too long to roast the garlic. My garlic burned and I had to do that part over. I cut that time in half and roasted it for about 15 minutes. Second, add more milk! The potatoes are otherwise very dry. I suppose cream cheese or sour cream would work too. Add more garlic. Do those things and the potatoes came out pretty good.

Made this with Thanksgiving dinner family couldn't get enough. Love the serving adjust feature I made enough for 40 serving's there were none left! Would make this again anytime. I didn't have time for the roasted garlic so used minced garlic instead and to make a bit richer used half cream / half milk. They were fantastic.

Nothing special! 45 minutes for the garlic is way too long.  I cooked it about 20 - 25 minutes but left it in the olive oil too long and it continued to cook! It was useless. 
My 15 year old son chose this recipe and I should have read all the reviews first. There are simpler ways of doing this.

I've been serving this for ages, and it is a beloved dish. I vary it with different potatoes, works well with New or Red Potatoes leaving some of the peel on. Great dish to experiment with.

My oldest daughter does NOT like mashed potatoes. To my surprise, she ate her whole serving! I didn't have garlic cloves so I roasted minced garlic from a bottle. Goes well with Chef John's Smothered Pork Chops.

Loved this recipe.  Had to roast two batches of garlic.  The first one got to brown and in turn was hard and would not go through the press.  The second time, I just roasted the garlic until it started to turn a light golden color and was soft to the touch.  Perfect!!!

These get 4 1/2 from us! My daughter absolutely loved these.  I would suggest a tad more salt, butter, and perhaps a little more milk.  I used almost twice as much garlic than the recipe called for because we love garlic.

For some who are still bewildered in the kitchen, "tender but firm" means don't overcook them (10-15 minutes).  If a knife can be inserted and withdrawn easily, the potatoes are done enough.  Garlic has a strong taste and some love tons and some just need a bit, so don't complain about a recipe if you're at the far end of the spectrum. When it says bake the garlic until it's golden brown, check on it periodically.  If it's done in 10 minutes, take it out then!(eye roll)   Now that that's outta me...  Great recipe, I'll definitely make these again.

I changed this slightly.  I used pre-packaged minced garlic, instead of whole cloves.  I also used a package of cream cheese, and some sour cream. I used heavy cream instead of milk. Finally, I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water.  I just kept adding garlic, pepper, and salt to taste, so I can't say how much I used exactly.  But they were delicious!!!

Great, simple recipe that produces a great tasting mash. After making it a few times, I settled on a version with only two changes: I boil my potatoes in chicken stock, and use some of the liquid instead of milk; and I omit the parmesan cheese. Both of these changes reduce the overall energy count and especially the fat content.

I make homemade mashed potatoes on a weekly basis if not more often. I usually just use salt , pepper , butter, and milk. I wanted to spice it up a bit and do something different. This recipe was so so easy to make. I sauteed the garlic in olive oil on my stove top since I only had minced garlic. The potatoes were very good but not a drastic change from regular mashed potatoes which was exactly what i was looking for. I would definitely make these again. I think I will experiment with some different shredded cheeses and maybe even some cream cheese also. This recipe is so easy to add too .

My husband loved this recipe.  I roasted the garlic in my toaster oven for about 15 minutes. I left the skins on for nutritional value.  No complaints.  My husband ate these three days in a row.

This was my first time making mashed potatoes and so it was a little confusing.  I forgot to look at the cook time so I was standing in front of the stove wondering when the potatoes would be done.  Anyway, for the garlic, Mine took forever to brown, which is weird compared to everyone else.  The mashed potatoes just tasted like potatoes... not like the type i ate in restaurants so i was a little disappointed.   I didn't add any cheese because of everyone's advice.  It was really easy to "mash" it though.

Nice recipe, tasted very good.  I got a little afraid it wasnt enough garlic so I added more lol which turned out to make it very strong.    The parmesan all melted and I couldnt taste any of it so I would either wait to the very very last minute to add it, add more, or not add it at all.  Good recipe, I just gave it a 4 because it wasnt amazingly out of this world, but that is hard to do with mashed potatoes.

So easy and delicious!  I did as a previous reviewer said and took the jarred minced garlic and put it in microwave with olive oil and it worked perfectly!  Will make again!

Outstanding!  I have been looking for a recipe that had the garlic flavor, but not too heavy.  This fits the bill.  I pulled out the garlic pieces that did not blend in the mixer.  I also added 1/4 cup mayonnaise.

Oh my goodness!  This was absolutely wonderful.  Don't change a thing.  My only advise is to watch your garlic - 45 minutes was a bit too long.  Start watching after 30 minutes.  ENJOY

These were delicious and so easy! The only thing was the cooking time for the garlic cloves. They were golden brown but then became hard and wouldn't really blend into the potatoes. I think I would adjust the cooking time to 30 minutes rather than 45.

These were just ok. Mostly just tasted like plain mashed potatoes. Couldn't really taste the garlic all that much. I'm not sure the parmesan cheese added much flavor either. I had leftovers which I added sour cream to the next day and it helped to make the potatoes a bit tastier.

This was a great recipe!  I added 1/2 block of a cream cheese block and cut down on the butter. It was excellent and creamy.  Just like my grandma's old recipe.

Ok, I really enjoyed this recipe. However, I had whole segments of garlic and my mixer would not crush them. Maybe that's my fault cause I have a crappy mixer. I would suggest crushing the garlic before mixing in the potatoes. But other than that, a great recipe. Thanks!

Great potatoes. I used cream cheese and a can of carnation evaporated milk instead of whole or 2% milk and this added a nice flavor to the potatoes. I also added some cheddar cheese upon serving.

These potatoes are amazing! I was going to make another kind of potatoes but didn't have cream cheese, so I quickly looked on allrecipes and found this one. I'm glad I did! My husband (who is definitely not a cook) took these on and they turned out great!! We didn't have any tarragon, so I used marjarom. I also added some garlic salt and cheese. We will definitely make these again!

Terrific.  I did half the potatoes w/ skin on, used 2 heads of garlic (we like garlic), and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  (Plus a pinch of oregano.)  Very yummy, but personal preference - not creamy enough.  I'm thinking a little sour cream or switching the milk for whipping cream next time.  Regardless - delicious!

I did this recipe for a block party and doctored it up a little,that's why I gave it 4/5 stars. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used minced garlic and didn't roast it (omit oil), I lowered the amount of milk and added 4 oz. cream cheese. I also threw in a little "Mrs. Dash", oregeno and italian seasoning. It was a HIT! I always have left over mashed potatoes, this time they were scraping the bowl! I will definately use this recipe again.

I used smoky cheddar Cougar Gold cheese the second time I made it. The original way is great. The Smoky Cougar Gold also went very well with the roasted garlic.

Outrageously delicious - my kids were asking for thirds! To save the hassle of roasting the garlic I just sauteed some in olive oil in  frying pan. But the garlic flavor wasn't quite as strong as I would have liked, so maybe I'll try roasting next time.

The first time I made this exactly as the recipe stated but wanted a stronger garlic flavor.
 This time I used garlic salt (instead of regular salt), used less milk and added garlic chicken broth (1/3 c) and 4 oz cream cheese. I think my mom added some extra garlic salt at the end too.
Great!

Very creamy and not too dry.  But if you're going to roast the garlic for long enough to make the flavor mild, I suggest using more.  For 3lbs potatoes I used 2 heads of garlic that I roasted for an hour.  It was definitely not too much!  Also added minced parsley and reduced the butter by half to remove some fat.

Delicious.  I sort of bypassed the roasting of the garlic, though.  I purchased a container of minced roasted garlic and used  that (1/2 tsp = 1 clove).  Fresh would be even better, of course, but if you add the minced while the potatoes are still hot before you mash them, the flavors mesh fine.  Adding oregano, garlic powder, and more salt made them perfect for my tastes.

These were so good, my husband wants them again this evening!  I guess I need to keep lots of garlic on hand at all times!  These potatoes were a perfect side dish to the 'Carmel Apple Pork Chops' as the meat was a little sweet and this added a more slight salty, pungent note.

These potatoes were excellent!  It seams that the time to roast the garlic was a little too long.  Other than that, we followed the recipe and it was a great result!

I hate when people review recipes and they change everything about the recipe...but I'm going to do a bit of that now (not on purpose). I forgot to roast the garlic ahead of time so I just put it through my garlic press. I also didn't have any parmesan to use, so I threw in a cup of sour cream. Wow! The potatoes were amazing and all of our guests when back for 2nds, 3rds and stuck their fingers in the pan. Thanks!

Superb, delish, and so easy to make!! Love the garlic flavor and the added parmesan. I did mix in a little bit of dill in at the end.

Followed recipe with minor change. Drizzled garlic buds (6) with olive oil and broiled them for 10 min or so. Flavor was GREAT!!

I really like this recipie. I used one big yam with the russets, gave it a nice color. I used evaporated milk instead of regular. Made it creamier.

I had to double everything except the garlic and potatoes because these mashed potatoes were so crumbly and the total opposite of the creamy mashed potatoes we love.  Neither my guests nor I were impressed and I would not make again.

These were really good, but since I adore garlic, I will add more next time. The only problem I had was that my garlic burned a bit while roasting, so next time I will try roasting it for about half the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were great...I doubled the amount of garlic.  This is worthy of 5 stars except that the leftovers did not reheat well...they were completely soupy to the point of being edible by spoon alone.  Very disappointing considering I had so much remaining.  I salvaged them by making a cheesy potato soup and including them as a thickener.  Not all was lost!  I will definitely make these again but will head the advice of other reviewers and cut the milk a bit.

Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe and didn't have any garlic cloves on hand, so I used garlic powder to taste.  Very good!

These were sort of bland.  You couldn't taste the paremesean cheese at all.  I added a tablespoon of minced onion and 1/4 cup of sour cream to jazz them up.  I also used Yukon Gold, which are better for mashed potatoes.  They need more butter and less olive oil.  Something was just missing.

This recipe was excellent, but I think only because I followed the user recommendations.  I used less minced garlic with olive oil in the microwave on high for a minute.  .  I doubled the milk and whipped the potatoes, my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe so far over all the other potato recipes we have tried.  This will definately be on our menu again.

the potatoes were okai. they seemed somewhat dry though. i would add more milk and the garlic should be minced first since the whole cloves did not mix very well with the rest.

Oh yeah, now that's what I am talkin' about!  The only thing I added was the oil that I roasted the garlic in and some parsley flakes.  I used red potaotes and left the skins on, so with the flakes I made my family think I had went all out!

Yummm...this is a great alternative to old fashioned mashed potatoes, especially if you are not serving them with a gravy...they have such great flavor you wouldn't need it!  I cheated and used Roasted Minced Garlic from a jar(using roasted is so much better).  I also added a little white pepper (secret from my mother) just to give a slight kick.

These were wonderful and a perfect compliment to Cola Pot Roast 2, also from this site. My family loves garlic, so I used a whole head. I drizzled the olive oil over it, wrapped it in foil and baked it in the oven. Afterwards, the garlic was very soft and easily squeezed out of its skin. I also saved 1/4 cup of the salted water after draining the potatoes and added that when mixing in the other ingredients. The potatoes came out perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. Thanks, Barrett, for this fabulous recipe!

The flavor was bland to me.  Maybe I overcooked the garlic but it definitely tasted weird.

These are to die for.  We made them one night and ended up having them three times in one week.  We recommend adding the tiniest bit of garlic salt to the recipe.  Yum!

These turned out really good. I didn't think the garlic cloves blended into the potatoes very well (even using the mixer) ~ so, I had to slice them down before putting them in. The 6 cloves was not too overpowering, like a few others mentioned ~ maybe they put in 6 *heads* instead. I'll be making these again! :o)

I really hate to give recipes low ratings, but...I (usually) LOVE using garlic on just about anything I can, however, in this case, even though it sounded great, I really thought that the six cloves of garlic were WAY too much.  Sorry Barrett, but this recipe didn't impress me at all.  I don't think I will be making it again, one out of six of us got seconds and one didn't even finish his.  Maybe there are others out there that are bigger garlic fans than us, and if that's the case, then give these potatoes a try, I'm sure you will love them...however if you are not big on garlic or you like a hint of garlic in your meals, then I don't think you'll be too impressed with this recipe either.

Oh man!  I KNEW I had forgotten something!  I was making this from memory for Thanksgiving Dinner and forgot the Parm!  It was still great without it.  I also added a couple dashes of Mrs. Dash's Garlic.  Added a really nice flavor.

This was very good and easy to make. A true comfort food. Would be great with a meatloaf covered with a tomato sauce. I served mine with stuffed green peppers. Roasting the garlic was a nice touch and filled the kitchen with a nice aroma, although I agree with the other reviewers that I would increase the amount of garlic next time as I felt it didn't come out strong enough as the recipe was written. A little sprinkle of paprika on top about 10 minutes before the dish comes adds a nice flair.

I love garlic mashed potatoes!  These were pretty good.  Next time I will leave on some potatoe skins, add more garlic, and will use whole milk (and more of it).  The potatoes still had that potatoe taste (of course, they're potatoes), and would like them to be more milky, myself.

I left the skins on.  I did not whip it very hard, but even when left chunky it was still very good.  I thought it was great, but I think I may have added a little too much extra garlic.  My husband said it burned a little!  I guess I just can't get enough garlic.

Did not like this.  My roasted garlic got hard while the potatoes were cooking and I had a hard time mashing it up.  This was dry and needed more milk too.  Would not make again.

Super yummy. I cooked mine for about an hour and a half in the oven with just two cube steaks. I didn't have seasoned salt so I used Everglades seasoning. Everything else I followed the directions. I made mashed potatoes and steamed green beans for sides. The boyfriend loved it.

Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken, I replaced it with 1 can of cream of mushroom and used 2 packets of onion soup mix. It was very good with the gravy over some garlic and Parmesan mashed potatoes. A perfect meal for a cold night when you want some comfort food to fill you up!

I used probably 8 pounds of potatoes and had to add a bunch of stuff. I used two entire cloves of garlic , which was fine but after I mixed it I picked some of the cloves out that didn't purée well. I added extra garlic powder, milk, parm cheese, butter, salt, and pepper. Overall it came out well, just had to keep checking it and adding stuff.

Delicious!!! And I accidentally overlooked the potatoes before I mashed them up but they turned out fine. This really isn't hard at all, and is so worth it! I took a couple l of the larger garlic cloves out after I cooked them and mixed them up with the mashed potatoes. (6 is a lot) but the taste is still definitely there! I paired it with grilled Parmesan asparagus, pulled pork, and homemade mac and cheese! #delicious

The roasting of the garlic was a bust.  Years ago I learned to roast garlic at a low temperature over a longer period of time but have lost the details except the garlic.  A whole bulb gets done with peels on except for cutting the tops off.  I ended up adding minced garlic.  I also required quite a bit more butter.

Great just like it is written. Garlic will be crunchy when you get them out of the oven. We used the flat side of a knife to break up the cloves, then chopped them up. Had a baked flavor and these taters turned out Great.

If you don't like eating whole pieces of garlic I would chop it up before I put it with the potatoes. Other than that it was great!

i thought it was ok i probably would have gone without the parmesan cheese though.I think that only a have a tablespoon would half been better than 2 tablespoons too.

Pretty good flavor but not as exceptionally good as I expected. Maybe the highly flavored steak I had with it overpowered the potatoes. We really like garlic so maybe I'll add a little more next time. Will try one more time to see if it's worth the extra effort rather than my regular approach of just butter and adobo seasoning.

Family loved it for a little zip in the traditional mashed potatoes.  Added in several red potatoes with skin on for a little texture and color.  Thanks for making thanksgiving a hit.

These are definitely good, but not the best mashed potatoes. I would suggest cutting the top off of the ENTIRE HEAD of garlic drizzling olive oil over it and wrapping it in aluminum foil and as others said only roast for 30 minutes. Also, I doubled the butter and parmesan cheese as suggested by other reviewers, for extra garlic flavor I also sprinkled in garlic powder and garlic salt instead of regular salt.

Made this recipe for Easter dinner, and was somewhat disappointed.  It had a slightly bitter taste. I don't know if it was the garlic, or the parmesan cheese, but I will try another recipe next time.

This was a side to accompany my Maple Salmon on Valentine's Day for my 3-year honey.  It was GREAT!  Love the potatoes and will definitely make them way more often!! Make sure you grade your own Parmesan to ensure freshness!  Remember, great ingredients make good food... :) Happy Valentines Day

Pretty good. Not as creamy tasting as I usually like mashed potatoes, and missing something. Maybe next time I'll switch plain yogurt for the milk. Thanks.

The flavor was great, but mine came out a little dry. But I just realized I misread the recipe and didn't cube the potatoes before boiling (I used red and kept the skins on), so maybe that's why. I'll add more garlic next time. The great thing about this recipe is you can use the basic ingredients and just tweak the measurements to your taste.

I gave this a 5 star rating not because of my preference but because of my family's preference. I loved the use of roasted garlic!  I usually sautee my garlic before making garlic mashed potatoes, but this will be a new tradition.  However, I didn't care for the cheese, I thought it made the potatoes sticky-gooey rather than the traditional mashed texture.  Won't use next time.  Everyone else loved them though - none were left!

I served this with Prime Rib at Easter. My guests really enjoyed these kicked up potatoes.  I added a little dried oregano and chopped parsley for more color though.

These were wonderful!  I used about 1/2 cup of Parm cheese and skim milk (all I had on hand).  I would recommend longer on the roasting of the garlic and allow enough time to let it cool before trying to squeeze it out.

Great recipe!!! I used 1/2 white, 1/2 red potatoes and left the skin on some to add texture. The roasted garlic and parmesean added such a great, unique flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

I change it up a little and put 2 cups of cheese, doubled the garlic and left the peel on the potatoes. YUMMY! They were the first thing we ran out of at Thanksgiving.

These were so yummy!  I didn't even need my electric mixer, cutting the potatoes into cubes made them super easy to mash with my potato masher.  Awesome recipe, the whole family loved it.

This was disgusting! I made it for Thanksgiving and had to start over because I hated this recipe. The cheese was horrible in the potatoes and I reccommend using garlic powder instead of the roasted garlic.

We really liked these.  The only thing I did different was omitted the salt for garlic powder and added some chives.  Nice change from regular mashed potatos.  Thanks so much for the post.

a very basic garlic potatoes recipe.  Instead of parmesan cheese, I added ricotta; only roasted 4 cloves of garlic and added 4 unroasted, minced cloves; and then just a bit of anise.

The concept of the recipe is good.  To me, it is a very basic outline of garlic mashed potatoes - not that there really is much to them...It was good, but did not have enough garlic for my taste.  The roasting of the fresh garlic was tasty, but just not enough.  I could have just had huge potatoes though!

I think I ended up with too much potato (maybe they were too big?) and if I had used all of it, the dish would have been bland.  The flavor ended up great.

45 minutes is way too long to roast the garlic! After 20 minutes, the garlic was burnt to a crisp and I had to throw it all out. Otherwise, the rest of the recipe was good.

Just finished cooking these.  I scaled the recipe back for 2 people.  
They need a lot of extra salt.  I probably should have used sour cream or cream cheese instead of the milk.   The garlic flavour however I quite enjoyed. These would be  pretty good with a little fixing!

These just didn't turn out for me at all.  They were so garlicy they were barely edible.  I may have let the garlic wait too long after roasting it -- it didn't seem to want to crush up in the potatos.  They also weren't as fluffy as I had hoped, but I didn't have an electric mixer handy.

Was very good. My family didnt care for it too well but I liked it. Next time I will use more garilc and I also used much more butter than called for. Over all it much better than plain old mashed potatoes. Will make again.

Came out more like whipped potatoes...didn't taste all that good either.  Maybe it was just me though: I aint the most amazing cook.  It was also my first try at mashed potatoes.

Very good, and not terribly fattening either.  I halved the recipe for my husband and I, and added another 1/2 cup of milk the next day before reheating them and it made them even creamier.  We enjoyed them for days, even w/ 1/2 the recipe!

This didn't work so well for me.  I was hoping for flavor like what you find in the Applebee's garlic mashed potatoes.  It didn't happen.

The potatoes weren't bad, just not what I thought they would be.  The garlic didn't seem to blend well throughout the mixture and was fairly potent where found.

These were good but nothing spectacular.  I may make them again and adjust the ingredients a bit.  I did cut back on the garlic but next time I would use the full amount because they really had no garlic taste.

AMAZING.  I made this for mom, and she said it was the best mashed potatoes she had oever had.  One thing I did differently was boil the potatoes in chicken boullion water, and use some of the stock along with the milk.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving Dinner.  My family loved them! They were the first side dish that disappeared.  I changed the recipe slightly however.  I used half of the garlic that the recipe called for and took another readers advise by putting the garlic in the microwave.  Will definitely make them again.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and while the Roasted Garlic was good, it was very strong.  And the roasting of the garlic was a little time-intensive than I had initially anticipated.  You definitely need some milk and butter added in, otherwise you're lookin' at a dry heap of potatoes.

These were good. I roasted the garlic for 20 min like some of the other reviewers suggested. I also added more butter, milk and cheese to taste. This is a good base recipe where you could have some fun experimenting with other seasonings, etc.

This was great.  I made these last night and usually I have left overs, but it was all gone.  I did as others suggested by foiling the garlic and heating the milk.  They were great!!! This is a keeper!!  Thanks!

Yummy! I love garlic! I also added chicken broth when mashing the potatoes and I used a nice blend of freshly shredded parmesan, asiago, provolone, and fontina. My garlic was done in less than half an hour, and I should have taken it out even sooner, as the outside of the cloves became quite crispy and I had to mince them before adding to the potatoes. The garlic did soften once added, though.

This recipe was incredible!  A little time consuming, but well worth it.  It's the first time in 19 years that I didn't have any leftover mashed potatoes!

I love garlic, but this was a little too garlicy for even me. Maybe crushing or mincing the garlic after roasting might help, or decreasing the amount, but finding huge chunks of dark garlic inside was unappealing.

Used minced garlic from a jar and results were terrific. Also added some heavy whipping cream. Quick and easy so gourmet.

YUM! These were great! We love garlic so I roasted about 6 cloves garlic in less oil for 20mins. I added a good dash of garlic powder too and also topped it with shredded gruyere and it baked over groundbeef and sauted veg. kind of like an Irish shepherds pie. Really scrumptious!

For Garlic mashed potatoes, there was not enough garlic flavor for me.  I used plain soy milk so did not experience the problem with too little liquid mentioned by others.  I also left the skin on for added texture.  I think that next time, in addition to adding more garlic, I will not use the electric mixer as I like 'em a little lumpy too. I was very excited by how easy it was!  Thanks!

I made a very similar dish for Christmas.  I added 8 oz. of sour cream and some dried basil, and I baked the potatoes after blending all the ingredients.  It is a wonderful recipe that tastes fabulous, and I don't even like mashed potatoes!

Yummy...the roasted garlic really sets these apart.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a whole head of garlic, as well as extra milk, butter and parmesan.  My fiance, who is very picky about potatoes, absolutely loved them, and so did I!

With changes others suggested...more garlic (for those that like lots of garlic flavor these would be great with a whole roasted garlic HEAD) and more liquid (they were too dry without more liquid) these were 5 stars with the changes.  Great base recipe, even as is still good, just made it for our taste preferences!!

This was very good, I quadrupled the garlic, and added extra butter and milk after reading the other reviews.  It would have been quite dry other wise.  My husband liked it alot, and he usually gets  mad when I mess with his traditional mashed pot.  Thanks I will make this again.

I followed the recipe and I agree with other reviewers that there isn't enough garlic flavor.  I want to try these again, but I'll use more garlic.  I do, however, like roasting the garlic first, it mellows the flavor and makes the garlic sweeter.

I thought it was great! I forgot to add the parmesan cheese, I doubled the garlic and used whole milk. I also used a combination of white and red potatos and left the skin on. Also, I used a hand masher instead of an electric mixer. I think you can too easily overbeat your potatoes with an e-mixer. Besides, I think a few lumps are good. I'll try it with parmesan next time.

My recipe came out a little thick but if you like garlic the flavor was pretty good.  I think we will stick with sour cream and butter from now on though.  Just as good as these and quite a bit easier.

Excellent recipe!!  I left half the skins on, used a 1/8 cup of heavy cream more, and extra garlic...  regardless the potatoes went over well...  I used the Turkey Giblet II recipe from the website- excellent combo..

delicious potatoes, quick and easy to make, but I agree with previous review--garlic does not need to cook that long--some of my cloves were overbaked.
