I have been making pork roast with this method for years!  It is absolutely moist & delicious Every Time!  I usually cook fat side up for 5 1/2 minutes per pound at highest temp oven can handle.  Turn the oven off, never opening the door for another hour.  Let sit another 10 min.  Enjoy.

I covered the roast with seasoning and placed it in a ziploc for a few hours before cooking it. I use the same technique to roast chicken and it always comes out good. This is quicky and easy. It's on the regular rotation!

I'm not really a pork fan but this is absolutely wonderful!  I used a cheap dry rub and it turned out perfectly!

Admittedly this in cooking mode, but smells AMAZING!
I am from California so I had to use  Oakland Dust for pork as the rub and followed the recipe with the other spices.
Now it's just biding my time for the waiting period!   :-)

I used less Worcestershire, but the flavor came through really well any way. I used a BBQ rub and a honey garlic rub which is what I had on hand. I put a couple of chicken bouillon cubes in a couple cups of water with slices of onion in the bottom of the pan. I put the roast on the rack and then poured the remnants of the rub/marinade over top. I ran into trouble because I only have one oven, so I put my potatoes in with the roast after I turned off the oven. After the 40 minutes I removed the roast and then had to leave it sit for another 40 minutes for the potatoes. By the time I cut into the roast, it was still red/bloody and not to temperature. So I returned it to the oven for another 15 minutes, first at 375 then 500. Finally it was ready to eat. It was still super-juicy (surprisingly) and delicious. Next time I will not do the oven sharing, and I think I will let it cook longer, possibly at a lower temperature after doing the 24 minutes at 500. I'll update if I can. But thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This worked very well.  I have to make my own "Montreal seasoning" due to a garlic allergy, but it works.  What a great cooking method.  If your roast is large, you'll want to go with the longer cooking time because it's hard to add time with this method though.

It was very good.  The only change I made was less black pepper and more garlic since we don't enjoy spicy food.

Took longer to cook than is in recipe.  I had to put it back in & cook for another 40 mins at 375 F.  Great rub though, very tasty.

I had always wanted to try high temp cooking but was skeptical.  I bought a 4 lb boneless pork roast and tried this recipe.  It did not work out well and I am an experienced good cook.  I followed the direction including the cook times per lb given at the bottom of the recipe-20 min per lb. so  40 min at 500* for my roast and turned the oven off and waited an hour and checked the temp of the roast.  125*.  The oven was too cool when I got it out to do anything for it so I had to turn the oven back on and try to get it done.  Dinner was 30 min late and the roast was still too rare thru about half of it.  We sliced off what we wanted to eat but it was a disappointment.  Today I'm going to just simmer it in the crock pot on low and try to get some pulled pork for sandwiches out of it.  Not likely to try this again.
