I dare you not to eat all of this directly out of the bowl. Make the whole portion because half will only make it to your cake! It is a light and fresh accent to your pastry; not too sweet and not too tart. I was weary about the butter giving it too much butter flavour, but it doesn't. No one particular flavour overpowers this. I suggest adding the milk at the end of your mixing little-by-little as you need to judge the consistency you want. If you want a glaze, then add more milk, if you want a frosting then add less. The amount of lemon is right on. Thank you Dwight E for the recipe.

1/2 c milk is too much. It turned out very runny. I would add 1/4 c to start and adjust from there as needed.  Turned out to be more of a glaze, which would have worked well say on angel food cake ...

This is not a frosting itâ€™s a glaze. I made it because it was supposed to be a frosting. Extremely disappointed

Tastes amazing, but the texture was kind of strange. I recommend adding toasted coconut to the frosting to make it taste one level up. YUM!

A bit sweet for me, I will use less powdered sugar next time and reduce milk accordingly. I love lemon and this hit the spot.

Love this recipe but for me it was too much frosting. I am doing 2 pound cakes.
