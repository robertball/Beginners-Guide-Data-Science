I tweaked this a bit to my own liking.  I omitted the red pepper and added onion powder instead.  Because I am impatient and lazy, I didn't refrigerate the fish. After I coated them they went straight into the pan. I had 4 large fillets to cook so I fried 2 at a time in 4 T oil.  Didn't add the water as they already had enough moisture to cook. I completely forgot I had cornmeal until I found this recipe and went searching for it.  Did you know you can use expired cornmeal from FY 2012 as long as it has not been opened? Super simple way to pan fry Swai.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Great instructions on how to cook fish well for someone without much fish cooking confidence. I had to use breadcrumbs, added rosemary in place of old bay, and no time for the refrigerator,  but delish! My daughter and I are tentative with fish and had seconds. My fish loving hubby was excited as soon as he saw it in the pan.  Will definitely repeat!

I'm rating this  according to the way I cooked it  since All Recipes  no longer allows notes.  In cornmeal I used 1 tbsp garlic , 2 heavy tbsp Cajun seasoning only. I did not ad the water. Frying something crisp then adding water made no sense. Hubby said it was the best way I've cooked his fish. I don't eat it either. Ty for the cooking instruction, which is what I needed.

This recipe saved the day!  It just so happened that the only fish that wasn't outrageously priced was swai, which I've only baked in the past. I live in Texas and I'm still WEEKS away from being able to use the oven without jacking up the temperature in the whole house! I thought I'd grill the fillets, but hubby-kins*forgot* to tell me we're out of charcoal. I in "swai" here at allrecipes and found this great alternative!  I used the crushed red pepper flakes with some pre-packaged fish coating mix (zataran's?) I had on hand. Wow!! Great taste and very, very easy to fry up 
.. 5 minutes or so on each side for a lovely browned crunchy fillet.  I omitted the last step (add water, cover, cook) because the fillets were perfect without it. Thanks for sharing this dish!!

Great recipe! Tweaked by adding about 1cup of crushed cornflakes in the mix. But everything else was straight off this easy recipe. This is definitely a SAVE!

Substituted sole for swai , skipped the water called for in the recipe, served with mango salsa atop a bed of basmati riceâ€” beautiful results

I am generally not good at frying, but it turned out well. Very easy to prepare. I added parsley flakes and rubbed sage to the seasoning mixture. My wife is very picky about her fried fish, so I was very happy that she likes it as well.

I love this recipe! I used Louisiana Cajun seasoning and I omitted the water step but the fish came out so golden and crispy.   I will make this again for sure, it's so easy
