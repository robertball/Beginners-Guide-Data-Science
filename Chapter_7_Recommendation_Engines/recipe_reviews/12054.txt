Excellent!  I have made this for several years.  I love to pile my freezer full and enjoy it all year long.  I no longer make it in a crockpot.  I found that the crockpot is too small and messy for the recipe.  I simmer it on the stovetop in a large stock pot for a few hours.  I find that the sauce becomes much thicker when I make it on the stovetop.

I did this in a lobster pot on the stove because there isn't a crock pot big enough for the bounty of tomatoes I had from the garden this year.  The seasonings for this recipe are good and proportionate, and for a meatless sauce, it is outstanding. I did not use any oil.  I chop and add veggies to the pot as is. I blanched and peeled the tomatoes, though, and left them chunky.  Also, I added a lot of green peppers, onions, and fresh mushrooms to make it stocky, and I added more tomato paste because I like the sauce thick.  This is as good a basic recipe as I've tried.  Thanks.

Have made this recipe multiple times.  The sauce is wonderful and I end up cooking it in the slow cooker overnight.  Makes a LOT!  Best served on tortallini and used for lasagna.  I usually add a full can of tomato paste for EACH quart I freeze otherwise sauce is "waterery".

This recipe was really good.  I cut the recipe in half b/c that was all the tomatoes that I had.  I needed a way to use my tomatoes and ones that a friend gave me.  I did cook on low for about 6 hours.  I omitted the bell pepper b/c my family doesn't like them.  I added extra garlic (b/c we love garlic, I roasted it first and used the whole head) and some red pepper flakes.  I used my Braun hand mixer to puree the sauce.  I used the whole can of tomato paste.  It is a very good sauce.  Tastes like a basic sauce, but better than the jarred stuff.  I froze in 3 ziplock freezer bags for later.  ********Update:  I made this again. Just a week later.  This time I used the full 16 cups of tomatoes.  Well a little over.  I bought over 5 lbs of plum tomatoes.  I still left out the bell pepper, and added about 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, and 2 heads roasted garlic (drizzle with olive oil and cook 35 min. in 400 degree oven, squeeze out garlic). I followed the rest of the ingredients exactly.  I left it on low in the crockpot for 8 hours.  When I came home it smelled like an italian resturant.  I removed the bay leaves and pureed the sauce with my Braun hand mixer to make it smooth adn added 1 can of tomato paste.  It made about 3 1/2 quarts.  I plan on freezing it.  My last batch is gone already.  It was excellent!  I made spagetti and meatballs and eggplant lasagna with the sauce last time.

I made minimal changes to this recipe when trying it for the first time - I peeled the tomatoes first (personal preference), reduced the sugar to only 1/8 cup, and reduced the salt to 1-1/2 tbls - I did make this on the stove, simmered it for three hours.  Served it to my ITALIAN father-in-law and he declared it "Great" - he said his mother used to make a sauce like it many years ago.  Some of us topped it with feta cheese, and some of us topped it with shredded parmesean (instead of grated).  Thanks very much for the recipe Stephanie- it's a keeper!

Hey Hey!  I made my own sauce!  This is a great way to use up tomatoes about to go bad.  I did not deviate from the recipe at all except to slow cook it on the stovetop instead of the crockpot.  As such, I think it was a bit too salty.  Next time, I think I will add mushrooms.  This recipe definately has a lot room for creativity.  FYI - one batch fills 2 28 oz (Barilla sized) pasta sauce jars.

I just made this last night.  It was a lot of chopping, but well worth it.  I froze 3 batches and we ate a batch for dinner.  It will be a real treat this winter. Everybody had seconds.  This is a keeper and a great way to use up your gardern or veggies that you picked up at the Farmers Market.  I added jalepeno to give it a little kick.  Awesome! PS:  Don't forget it is 1 can of tomato paste per quart.

I did scald and peel my tomatoes first.  I gave this 5 stars due to how great it tastes and how easy it was.  I have spent a lot more on ingredients and time on other spaghetti sauces and this one was just as good AND simple.

I have a question.  Why add the tomato paste when ready to use?  Can't you freeze the entire recipe with the tomato paste?  It sounds fabulous and I can't wait to try it. thank you

We loved this recipe and were able to use lots of our fresh garden tomatoes.  I made it as outlined except added a full can of tomato paste, a few sliced mushrooms and a little extra seasoning (we like ours spicier).  It was great!  I even added a few partially cooked meatballs halfway through the cooking time.  I made the recipe to eat right away.  Now that I have found out how good it is and how easy to make, I will make a few more batches to freeze.

A great, basic recipe.  While dipping the tomatoes in a hot water bath to get the skins off, I let them sit in there for about 5 minutes.  This cooks the tomatoes down a bit.  I then let them sit in a collander for about 30 minutes to drain out the excess juice which makes the sauce runny.

This sauce is the best.  I only made half a batch just in case I didn't like it, and now I wish I had made more!

This was a lot of work - but worth it!  Couple changes (I know, I know!) -  I did peel and seed my tomatoes (boiling water/ice bath method), cut the sugar, added red pepper flakes, pureed the sauce, and simmered on the stove top.  The sauce is thin as is, but is perfect when you put in the paste and simmer a bit longer.  Note - a 6 oz can of paste is needed for every quart of sauce you have (4 cups = 1 quart).  Also, I found when using my big boy tomatoes that each tomato was roughly a cup of chopped tomatoes. I did freeze my three remaining quarts without the paste, I like the idea of simmering the sauce with the can of paste and maybe adding fresh herbs before serving.  Tasty, thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe!  For those who say it's watery, the trick I use is to boil (then put in cold water) and peel the tomatos, then cut them in half and squeeze out as much of the water as possible, as well as getting rid of the seeds.  That should help.  Also, for people who are hesitant about adding sugar...it counter acts the tomatoes, and is what gives it more of a "spaghetti sauce" flavor, rather than an overly tomato paste flavor.  I usually start by just adding a little bit, and continue to add until it tastes right.  I don't think I've ever used 1/4 of a cup, though.  Don't be afraid of the sugar!  Just some thoughts...love making this!

I followed the recipe as written.  The sauce was amazing, but watery, until I added the 6 oz of tomato paste.  It was terrible after that and I tried adding back more spices, pepper, a little sugar, etc. and it still tasted like tomato paste.  I'll try just adding cornstarch whisked with water to the next quart.  I am surprised no one else has commented on the bad tomato paste flavor.  This leads me to believe I'm doing something wrong.  If you have any ideas, please let me know! I still have more in the freezer without the paste.

Someone gave me about 40 beefsteak tomatoes and I blanched them, removed the peel, and squeezed them to break them up. I followed the recipe except I didn't use a green pepper and I used fresh basil. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and sauteed the onions and garlic on top of the stove. When the onion were translucent, I transferred them into my crock pot. I have a huge crock pot and it was filled to the top. I cooked it on high for 2 hours and on low for about 4 hours. I let it sit overnight until it was completely cooled down and loaded them into quart and gallon bags to freeze. I will add tomato paste when they're defrosted and I hope to have enough sauce for most of the winter. I tasted it all along and it was great. I even made a quart of tomato juice before even putting the tomatoes into the crock pot. Thanks for this great recipe, Stephanie.

I actually had 16 cups of tomatoes on hand from my CSA box, so this was perfect for me.  I used everthing except for the bell pepper.  It turned out really flavorful and my husband and I look forward to eating this spaghetti sauce all winter.

I scaled the recipe back as I only had about 3.5 cups chopped tomatoes, left out the green pepper, sauteed on the stove, extra garlic and extra basil and oregano, used olive oil - I was too impatient and only simmered for an hour, it's delicious!  It is sweet, but I like sweet.

You don't have to add tomato paste to thicken it. just add cornstarch whisked with a little cold water...then drizzle the mixture into the hot mixture...it will thicken nicely. This way you don't have the canned tomato paste taste nor the expense of buying it.

Great recipe.  I upped the garlic to 6 cloves, used 2 cups chopped onions, coconut oil in place of vegetable oil, fresh basil and parsley from my garden, sea salt and 2 cans of tomato sauce that I put in before cooling the sauce.  I found that I neded about 17 or 18 large tomatoes to get 16 cups as called for.  I also pureed the sauce after it was done.  I don't like chunky tomatoes in my spaghetti sauce.  After pureeing it was perfect.  I then vacuumed sealed lots of pint mason jars and froze a lot of it for this winter.  Great recipe....yummy spaghetti sauce.

This recipe was very easy and very good. I followed the directions using many items from my garden. I also used a mixture of fresh and dried herbs since I had some fresh items from my garden as well. The tomato paste really makes the difference here and it is a very important step not to be missed. It thickens it completely up. I just wish there was some way to make it thick by using fresh ingredients so it could be 100% organic from my garden. One tip - we divided it in half and used Mexican spices in one half and we made a great sauce for enchiladas and other Mexican items.

Love it. Great for summer when we have tons of tomatoes in the garden. Made tons! Haven't bought a jar since. Just wondered why chop the tomatoes? It's a waste of time. They fall apart on their own when you cook them. It looks more like a regular spagetti sauce when the tomatoes are not diced before cooking... And more like a salsa when you do. I also blanched them first to get the skins off.

I have made this recipe for a couple of seasons now.  Very easy but takes some time. I make it in a dutch oven on the stove.  It's not quite so messy this way. I blanched and peeled my tomatoes first and removed the seeds.  It makes for a thicker sauce. I also used a whole head of garlic and added some carrots from my garden.  I think this year I will add some zuccini as well.  I add the tomato paste before I freeze and I puree the sauce.  My family does not like chuncky sauce.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!  Very fresh and tasty!!

Awesome sauce! I simmered all on the stove for several hours, cut the sugar and salt to 1 T. and used olive oil (a must in my opinion for anything Italian), and used 2 T. Italian seasoning and 1 T. oregano with fresh basil for the herbs. I also added the tomato paste. It made about 4 quart jars. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Delicious!  Used produce from my garden: tomatoes (peeled, partly seeded and diced), peppers, onions, and threw in a patty pan squash and some mushrooms.  Cooked in a 6 qt. slow cooker on low for about 6 hours.  I saved the juice from prepping the tomatoes, and mixed several Tbsp of cornstarch with a cupful near the end of cooking to thicken it up.  Won't need to add the tomato paste when preparing to serve.  We enjoyed some over angel hair pasta that night, and froze the rest.  A definite keeper for freezer pasta sauce!

Is there a certain type of tomato that should be used for this recipe (or would be best)?

Thought this made a great homemade sauce. I did use fresh basil instead of dried for more flavor. I cooked for 2 1/2 hours then had to put in fridge overnight (it was already 11:00pm) Next day I added tomato paste but had to add almost 2 6oz cans to get it to my own personal desired thickness. Believe this recipe is a great one to tweek to suit your own tastes.

I make this every few months and it is so worth it! You can't find a jarred sauce at the store that can beat this. Depending on my mood, I will add mushrooms, more garlic, port wine, etc... Sometimes I leave out the meat, whatever our tastes are at the time. It's a very versatile recipe and freezes very well.

I made and froze this sauce at the end of last summer and I am still using it up.  Very good!  I also peeled the tomatoes by blanching first.  I omitted the green pepper and I simmered for a couple hours on the stove top instead of using a slow cooker.  As a previous reviewer noted, I add a 6oz can of tomato paste for each quart when I heat it up.  I will definitely use this recipe again this summer.

Absolutely wonderful! We used our fresh tomatoes, fresh parsley, and fresh basil from our garden. The only thing we changed is we did not use the bell pepper and instead of vegetable oil we used olvie oil and only 1 tbl of it. The 1/2 cup is not needed!

Instead of chopping all those tomatoes, quarter them and put them in the blender, peel and all.  This works great for using up all those cherry tomatoes, too.

I just realized that I have not reviewed this recipe.  We made this spaghetti sauce last summer with fresh veggies from the garden.  This was alot easier than some sauce recipes.  I do think the sauce is a bit on the runny side but the tomato paste does help a little.  I like using the roasted garlic tomato paste for extra flavor.

Turned out great - we used up the fresh tomatoes from the garden, red instead of green peppers (since that's what we grew in the garden too) and added some extra red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit, but other than that we followed the recipe as it was. We also added a big can of tomato paste before freezing and the sauce defrosted perfectly! Thanks so much for this great, easy, and tasty recipe!

Excellent recipe!!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding mushrooms and I added the paste in the beginning instead and I also made it on the stove top.  I have seven bags in my freezer from the first time I made it and I have a huge batch on my stove as I am writing this review.  Will make this over and over!

This is a fantastic sauce!  I made 8 quarts with my yellow and pink heirloom tomatoes from the garden this summer.  Used the sauce in lasagna, and it was the best lasagna I've made.  I won't "waste" the sauce on regular spaghetti now, but save it all for lasagna.  I will definitely be making this again next year.  The only change I made was to cook it on the stove-top for about 2 hours instead of using the slow cooker.

This is pretty good.  It was a bit acidic, but I eliminated the sugar--bf hates it in spaghetti sauce.  I really don't know how much I made, bc I gave up on measuring.  I did attempt to follow the recipe amounts at first, but that didn't last long. . . anyway, I peeled the tomatoes by boiling them for a minute then the skins came right off.  I also just broke up the tomatoes with my hands as another reviewer did.  I didn't have peppers to add, but I did add mushrooms (for the bf)and 2 bay leaves.  I added a 12 oz can of tomato paste to all of it and it was the perfect consistency for me.  Very good, thanks!

I scaled this recipe to suit the amount of tomatoes I had to use.  I also used fresh herbs from my garden and adjusted the amounts accordingly.  I added mushrooms, a little balsamic vinegar and a dash of red pepper flakes.  After simmering, the sauce was awesome.  I froze most, but saved some to reheat for supper.  It was great.  I hope the the thawed results are just as good.

I was overrun with tomatoes and had this recipe suggested to me on the morning buzz.  What a great recipe! I cooked the sauce on top of the stove in my dutch oven versus the crockpot.  Had plenty of fresh oregano & basill so added those.  I simmered the sauce all afternoon, about four hours, on low.  It smelled so good! I did freeze the sauce, but I could not wait and pulled the first batch out of the freezer within the week.  I browned ground beef, added 2 quart bags of the sauce, and two small cans of tomato paste.  Simmered all for about forty minutes or so.  Delish!  Thanks for a great recipe and an excellent way to use up plentiful garden tomatoes :)

Wonderful spaghetti sauce.  I made numerous batches of this last summer on the stovetop rather than the slow cooker.  I just cooked on med-low for 2 hours until it reached the thickness I wanted.  I froze it in Ziplock bags.  If you want a nice thick sauce, that doesn't water up and run all over your pasta, make sure you add the can of tomato paste when using this in a recipe.  This is a wonderful recipe to use those summer tomatoes.  Since making this last summer I have not purchased any store bought spaghetti sauce.

Yummy! My kids aren't big on veggies so once everything was soft after cooking I blended with my hand blender and they had no idea I had added veggies to their dinner!  Added different veggies each time I have made it. Carrots, bell peppers, whatever sounds good to you will work with this fantastic recipe!

This recipe is a great way to use up my garden tomatoes. I did blanch the tomatoes to remove the skins, then cut them in wedges to remove most of the seeds. The suace was a bit thin, but when I was heating it for dinner, I threw a few spaghetti noodles in the sauce. They helped absorb some of the extra water/juice. I liked the flavor was not too spicy for the kids.

I think that this recipe is PERFECT!  I used less salt because someone reveiwed and said too much salt.  I used 2 teaspoons salt.  I also did not freeze this, I canned it!  Worked out wonderfully!  Thanks !

Used my garden veggies for this and followed the recipe exactly. Then I canned in (I'm running out of freezer space).  Opened a jar last night to make spaghetti and my husband couldn't believe it was my homemade sauce.  We all LOVED it!! Thank you for this great recipe.

Yum!  This was just the recipe I was looking for.  I followed the recipe, except I omitted the tomato paste.  Instead, I uncovered my crock pot for the last 30-45 minutes to let it thicken on it's own.

You definitely need the tomato paste so it isn't so watery. I have a 6 quart crock pot and it was filled to the brim but it all fit! I actually cooked it on low for 8 hrs... the longer it cooked, the better it tasted. If you have a big crock you can pull this off but it's got to be at least 6 quarts to get it all in! Very yummy!!!!

This recipe worked AWESOME, even though I reduced it by a factor of 8!  I divided the recipe by 8 because I was only cooking for 2 and those were the ingredients that we had, but I did add a whole 6 oz can of tomato paste.  I blanched  3 large tomatoes first and then peeled and chopped them.  I added everything to the crock pot (except I didn't use oil and I used fresh herbs instead of dried) without sauteeing anything first and cooked on high about 3.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so.  Then I turned it to low and let it just stay hot while I cooked some hot italian brats, sliced them and put them in the sauce for another 30 minutes or so.  This was delicious over spaghetti and a great way to use all our produce. The leftovers were even better the next day.

Delicious.  I peeled my tomatoes (boil/ice bath method) and chopped them - about 9 cups worth. My edits: I used olive oil, and not quite as much as called for, I used fresh basil, and I put 12oz of tomato paste in while the sauce was cooking.  I also did it in a dutch oven on the stove, as opposed to a slow cooker.  I simmered for a couple of hours and we ate some with pasta for dinner - amazing!  I can't tell you what it'll taste like after freezing, but it was the best pasta sauce I've had (meatless).   Thanks for the recipe!

Stephanie's Freezer Spaghetti Sauce Haiku: "Fresh tomatoes, yay! Why not use all fresh herbs too? Not quite thick enough." Tomatoes abound in my garden right now, so while plucking those, I grabbed handfuls of oregano, basil and parsley too, and I took the extra time to quickly boil and peel the tomatoes. Stayed faithful to the rest of the ingredients, and my only complaint was that even w/ the tomato paste, it was still a thin sauce that didn't cling to pasta at all. The taste was great, but I like a little more thickness to my sauce.

GREAT SAUCE!!  We have been making this nearly a year now and my family LOVES it!  My family does not like chunky veggie style sauce, but I follow this recipe in addition to adding a couple of peeled/diced carrots, mushrooms, sometimes a red bell pepper, zucchini, and yellow squash.  I cook it on low for 6-10 hours then let cool completely before putting in quart freezer bag.  I puree with a hand blender so it's nearly chunk free. It is watery when defrosted, but heated on the stove with one can of paste and it's perfect!  Natural, filling, and packed full of veggies!

Delicious use of garden tomatoes, and so nice to have my freezer full of spaghetti sauce ready to go! This is my 2nd year making this, I make several (large) batches a year.  I make this in a 12 qt stockpot, and since my kids don't like "chunks" in their sauce, I pureed the veggies in the food processor first. (And I add 8 oz. mushrooms and a zucchini). I don't add any sugar. Add Italian Seasoning, fresh basil, and a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I store it in quart sized freezer bags and have really enjoyed having it.

Great flavor! We canned this recipe to use throughout the year.  Good flavor, we doubled the recipe, omitted the oil, and saved the paste for when we serve the sauce.  Also, thought to add meat and mushrooms, etc. then as well.  We let this cook all afternoon and it was great.

I have made this 3 years in a row and it's great! My only tweaks is to use fresh basil, fresh oregano, and replace the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper (we're not green pepper fans). It froze beautifully and tasted SO fresh even out of the freezer.

I did like this recipe. It's a great way to use up tomatoes. I used varying types tomatoes... and made half the recommended batch. I did use fresh basil and eliminated the green pepper. I let the sauce cook as recommended, cooled it, and let it sit in the fridge overnight. The next day, I pureed part of it and mixed it all together. It's a little thinner than I would like, but delicious... my husband and son ate it right up too! Will make again (assuming I am lucky enough to have that many tomatoes!).

Used fresh basil, oregano and rosemary, since that's what I had.  Taste was a little sweet, will decrease sugar the next time.  Also was a bit to liquidy, even after adding paste to serve, but will just use a little more tomato paste.  All in all, quite a success!

5 star recipe!  I had lots of tomatoes and I am not a canner so I was thrilled to find this recipe, as my family and I love Italian food. I made and froze several batches of this in the past two weeks.  Some things I did differently:  I cooked it on the stove and in 1/2 batches so I could use my Dutch oven.  I kept all of the ingredients the same except I increased the amount of garlic.  I blanched the tomatoes so I could remove the skin.  While cooking I simmered for 2 hours with the lid on and then for another 2-3 hours uncovered until the consistency looked just right.  I added the tomato paste during the last bit of cooking. My family loved this and all agreed that it was much, much better than jarred sauce. One big problem:  we have already started to eat the sauce and I am sure it won't last long!

I have made this several times over and decided I needed to put a review up.  I live in china so getting 'canned' staples to make spaghetti sauce is hard.  I was able to find tomato paste but never the stewed tomatoes that other recipes required.  I am so happy to have found this one!  My husband just loves it.  It is easy to do and taste great.  I do blanche the tomatoes slightly to peel them (just because I like it that way) and sometimes i have thrown in some ground pork/sometimes not.  Either way works well.  It freezes great and I love that I do it one time and it yields several meals worth for down the road.  Thank you for this excellent recipe!  You have done me a big favor over here :)

Wonderful staple sauce.  I blended mine in the food processor and added a touch more garlic.  Also, I simmered it on the stove because my slow-cooker couldn't hold this large of a batch.  I cheated and stirred in the tomato paste before transferring it to freezer bags.  I'm not sure if it made any difference because it still freezes great and has a great texture.  I'll keep this one on hand regularly.

Awesome recipe.  I love that I don't have to peel the tomatoes.  So much less work than most of the recipes.  I've added a couple of chopped eggplants as well.  Adds some extra nutrition and you can barely tell it's there!

I bought an outrageous amount of tomatoes at the local farmers market to make sauce, salsa, etc. This recipe was one of the few that called for the highest amount of fresh ingredients. I made this sauce a few months back for a fellow co-worker who was promoted; we had a "snack day". I made it with Turkey meatballs, enough for about 12-14 people. My husband took a small taste before I left home with it and was so impressed he was VERY disappointed to find out it wasn't for the family's supper that night. I went to work with a full crock-pot and it didn't last 2 hours....I had tried before to make my own sauce and never succeeded...the only person who made the best homemade sauce was my mother (in my opinion). This was pretty close, if not better. Sorry for not rating this before, but it certainly deserves some praise. I CANNOT wait to make it again!

Due to mixed reviews, I cooked my sauce on the stovetop until it was the desired consistency (about two and a half hours).  As other reviewers have mentioned, peeling the tomatoes first is a good idea.  I thought the recipe was pretty fantastic.  Only changes I made were to use fresh herbs instead of dried (because I had them) and I added a couple of bay leaves.  Also, I'd recommend cutting the salt in half.  You can always add more later.  I used the sauce last night for baked ravioli (beef ravioli layered with the sauce and shredded mozzarella) and it got rave reviews.

This was my first try at making sauce from tomatoes, and it came out great!  I made very minimal changes (I used dried parsey instead of fresh, I only used 1 onion and I added a few bay leaves) and I loved the end results.  I also browned some spicy italian sausage and meatballs and threw them in to simmer with the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

We love this. I don't use vegetable oil but brown ground beef, usually around 3-4 lbs. I drain off as much of the fat as possible. I use a total of 24 oz of tomato paste and don't add the sugar until the end of the simmer time. I add about 1/8 cup. If I use canned tomatoes (no salt added), not fresh from the garden, I use even less sugar. I have never used a crock pot but have always done this stovetop. Thanks for a great post here.

I suggest using shredded carrots, (2 or three of them), to replace the sugar.  I have also added mushrooms (a pound of sliced white mushrooms is nice for most people, but I would put in 3-4 if I could being a BIG mushroom lover) and 2-3 diced zucchini.  This adds more veggies to the sauce and makes moms happier when their kids eat veggies.  Who's gonna tell the kids right?  I also cook this in a big pot on the stove, putting the tomato paste in at the beginning.  My sister bakes hers in the oven.  This is an all day thing, cutting veggies at 6 to get the sauce on the stove at 8am in time for dinner at 6 pm.  The house smells great, and the sauce freezes well in single portions, (1 cup), or multiple portions 4 or more depending on who is at the table and portion size.  Can throw meat in or veggie ground round, and adjust for spiciness.

I have never made homemade spaghetti sauce and thought I would try this as it seemed fairly easy! I love that I can make it in a slow cooker and save my burners for other things while I make it. I did halve the sugar but after tasting I think I would add a little more than I did. I think the next time I will also add another clove or two of garlic (only because we love garlic in my house lol). Other than that I thought this was a great recipe with lots of room to customize how you like your sauce! Will definitely make this to freeze as I should have plenty of tomatoes from the garden at the end of the season!

I would rate this as EXCEPTIONAL!  I made this recipe this summer to use up all the tomatoes we had in our garden as well as the onion, green pepper, basil and parsley.  I used my pyrex measuring cup and froze (28oz? same as jar of Prego) into gallon freezer bags. Laid them flat on cookie sheets to freeze and stacked them in the freezer.  I am just getting around to reviewing this the following January and I love it more every time I use it.  Thank you Stephanie!!

Our family didn't enjoy this too well. I have a ton of tomatoes and the first time I made this I improvised quite a bit and it wasn't very good. The second time I followed the recipe much more closely and it still didn't have very good flavor. Sorry.

very good.  good way to use up lots of tomatoes.  i thought I had alot of tomatoes, but had to use some canned as it called for more than I had still.  froze, and tastes good. and very easy besides all the chopping of tomatoes.  didn't peel tomatoes or seed them. may peel next time, but might not be worth the effort as it wasn't that big of deal

very good sauce! I sauted the veggies on the stove and then added all ingredients together in the crockpot. I only had 12 cups of tomatoes after cutting them all up, but decided to make the recipe with the same amount of ingredients listed. I think it turned out wonderful (we like full-flavored food though). I will make again with only 12 cups of tomatoes. 
I also let it cook over night in the crockpot in hopes that it would make it less watery, and it did. It came out just right to add an 8 oz can of tomato paste and serve when ready.
I got 5 quart size freezer containers full from this recipe.

I used this as a base recipe & customized it after reading several of the reviews. I also pureed it after it was done cooking as I snuck in several fresh zucchini's. I also used some of my jalapeno's to up the flavor kick! A great starting point for a recipe... use your imagination & your family's tastes & you too will have a winning recipe!

First time I have ever made spaghetti sauce from scratch with my garden tomatoes.  The sauce had more spice/kick to it than I expected, so that was nice!  I decided to freeze all of it since I feel like it's more of a "winter" spaghetti sauce than a more cool, refreshing, blander "summer" spaghetti sauce.  Yum!  Will make it again.

My husband and I made this together and liked the results.  We'd consider removing the tomato skins when we make it again.

Made it with double bell pepper and a pound of mushrooms. Also used fresh basil and it was TO DIE FOR. I could eat it plain with no spaghetti and be perfectly happy. I think next time I will reduce the sugar by half. It is sweet but yummy!

I'm sure this recipe would be wonderful -just be sure to use FRESH tomatoes, NOT CANNED. Using canned tomatoes turned out just okay. 4 Stars because of the potential. Don't change the recipe.

Nice flavors. Kind of chunky, and after tasting it, decided to leave it and use as pizza sauce. Did not add the tomato paste. Thanks a lot, Stephanie

Quick and easy (once you peel and chop the tomatoes). Loved being able to throw it in the slow cooker and forget about it! I chopped my tomatoes a bit big so I ended up using my blender to make some of it smooth and then mixed it with the chunky. I left out the bell pepper (didn't have it on hand). I used it later with the meatballs from "Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs" on this site and it was delicious! :) Will do again with my next load of tomatoes!

I first made Stephanie's Freezer Spaghetti Sauce in April of 2011 (that's the date on the copy I printed out and saved in my personal recipe file) That year I had a bumper crop of tomatoes. I'd always found frozen Spaghetti Sauce to be watery and preferred to can the tomatoes and use them to make sauce as I needed it. But, Stephanie's recipe sounded so good I gave it a try.
My rule  is to follow an new recipe to the letter the first time, then, either discard it or  tweak it until my husband and I love it. This is one of the few recipes that I am still following "to the letter" after making it every year for  seven years. One winter I ran out of sauce from the freezer  and made a new batch substituting canned tomatoes for fresh. The sauce didn't have quite the depth of flavor that I get from using my fat juicy heirloom tomatoes, but it was still really good. I do occasionally add browned meat, sausage or clams when I stir in the tomato paste, but most of the time we love it just as it is.

I actually made this to have tonight, not necessarily freeze, although I love that idea! It was wonderful, perfectly flavorful. My whole house smelled amazing. I used canned tomatoes rather than fresh and closer to a whole green pepper. Due to time, I just did it all in a pan on the stovetop for about an hour. I'm excited to have leftovers, as I'm sure it will taste even better tomorrow! What a simple, great recipe.

This is simply fabulous as is!  This is the second year I have made it using the end of the year tomatoes from my garden.  One slight variance - I use fresh herbs that I also grow.  They make for a very fresh tasting sauce, especially in the middle of winter!

I made this last year and simply LOVED it. I need to reduce salt for my husband, so did not put any salt in and made sure the tomato paste had 20 mg sodium (verses 310 mg!) So Good!

I've now made 3 batches of this recipe and have enjoyed it on pasta 3 times so far. Even my fiance, who was skeptical that a homemade pasta sauce could trump a store-bought canned version (yuck!) said that this was the best pasta sauce he'd had! I did make a few adjustments: 1) I blanched the tomatoes before chopping them up. I have read a few articles/reviews that keeping the skins on the tomatoes can create a more acidic pasta sauce - and I have a sensitive stomach, so I wanted to avoid making the sauce acidic; 2) I added the tomato paste to the slow cooker (rather than adding it when you are ready to use it, as per the recipe) - and I found that I needed 1 1/4 cans of tomato paste to prevent the sauce from being too runny (my first batch - following the recipe exactly - was too runny for my taste); 3) I halved the recipe since I didn't have enough ripe tomatoes at the time. I kept the sauce meatless to freeze, but when I prepare it for dinner I add browned ground beef (since we prefer our sauce with meat). So although I made adjustments, I still give the recipe 5 stars on taste alone! The amount of herbs and seasoning is just right, and it was a great way for me to use my garden produce & herbs, which makes it even more of a winner in my books! This recipe is a keeper FOR SURE!! :)

This is a great recipe and made delicious sauce.  We like a smoother sauce, so after it cooled, I pureed it in a blender.

I have made this sauce twice and my entire family loves it!  After all other ingredients are cooked I puree it right in the pot with my immersion blender and then I add 1 pound of browned ground turkey and 1 pound of browned ground mild Italian sausage to make a meaty sauce that is excellent on pasta or in lasagna. Thanks for this delicious recipe, it's a keeper!

MMMM!  this sauce is great and it Does freeze well.  I froze it in ice cube trays so whenever I needed some sauce I could just thaw however much I wanted.  I loved using my own tomatoes and basil from my garden.  Any time you can use a crockpot is awesome, too!  Mine came out a little watery, so I just add some tomato paste or pizza sauce to thicken it.

A very nice combo of seasonings, I used fresh herbs so tripled the measurements of those.  Before we had crock-pots -and if you do not have a big enough one - I used to use a large turkey roasting pan and cook  it down in the oven, 300 degrees F, stirring once an hour til it thickened to what I wanted.

This sauce is amazing!  I was out of parsley and I didn't realize until I was already in the process and it still has great flavor.   We added 2 jalapenos and 1/2 red hot cherry bomb pepper.  Yum!  The recipe says it yields 3 quarts, but my 6.5 quart dutch oven is nearly full.

I was able to use my 4 quart crock pot and it fit just fine.  It is a delicious recipe!  I only added some mushrooms (about a cup) to the sauce.  I put it into a lasagna tonight and my husband (who is a much better cook than I am) really liked it.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Stephanie!!!

This summer was my first time making homemade spaghetti sauce and it couldn't have been easier!  I left out the pepper and used olive oil instead of veg oil.  I've made several batches and all taste great.  I add the tomato past while cooking in the crock pot.  Once cooked, I cool and put in the blender to make a really smooth sauce.  Excellent!!

LOVED it!  Put so many of those excess tomatoes to good use.  I did take the skins off first and threw them in the food processor first.  Also added the paste pronto.  Used roasted red peppers instead of green.  Super!

I had so many tomatoes from the garden I wanted to find an easy recipe to use them with.  I found this and it is awesome!!!  I usually don't change recipes but I don't like sweet sauce so I omitted the sugar and added mushrooms and italian saugage.  This was so flavorful and easy to make.

As I was making this I didn't think I was going to like it, but it actually turned out to be really good.  When I served it, I added some meatballs to beef it up a bit.

I've never made spaghetti sauce this way, but it turned out great and very fresh! I made this while I was pregnant and it has come in handy with a new baby. I plan on always keeping some on hand in the freezer!

I have been making lots of this spaghetti sauce and freezing it.  I did use the sauce once on a boli pizzi and it was out of this world.  So I made more of the sauce and froze it.  I can't wait to thaw in the winter and have tasty homemade sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome sauce!  I just blanched and broke the tomatoes up with my hands.  I only added 3T of garlic and 3 onions, because I didn't quite have enough tomatoes. I cooked it down for 5 hours, then pureed the sauce.  It was wonderful.

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't like this at all (as written).  It just seemed like a bunch of seasoned tomatoes.  I used about 1/2 fresh tomatoes and 1/2 canned diced tomatoes.  After cooking on high for 4 hours in the crockpot (any less wouldn't have seemed done at all), I ended up running everything through a blender.  I then put it in a stockpot and added about 28oz of tomato sauce.  I let it simmer for about 1 1/2 hours on the stove.  I haven't added tomato paste yet, though it doesn't seem like it really needs it.  I do like the sauce I ended up with, but I won't make it again.  I'm going to keep looking for a different recipe using fresh tomatoes.  Sorry!

Great basic recipe!  Next time  I will double the garlic; the sauce was wonderful but it needed more garlic for our tastes.  Thanks for the perfect way to empty my garden & fill my freezer with a healthy sauce that I can use for pizzas, lasagna, spaghetti or just dipping bread in, YUM!

This was my first time making spaghetti sauce from fresh tomatoes and it was a hit. I made a few adjustments. Used only 1 lg onion. Cut green pepper in half and seeded it. Cooked as two halfs. Kids don't like green peppers and this way they'll never know. Cooked on stove - 5 hours on day 1. Sauted pork ribs in separate pan to get rid of some fat and added to sauce.  Cooked next day for 8 hours. Added 3 x 5.5 ounce cans of tomatoe paste. Delicious!

Thank you SO much.  This is so good.  I only made half a batch, but my boyfriend said it was the best spaghetti he'd ever eaten and at the top of the list of one of his favorite meals ever.  I followed the recipe pretty closly I omitted the oil, added a jar of mushrooms, a bay leaf, and a little red pepper flake; and cooked it on the stove. Can sauce will never be the same.

This is a great recipe!  I was a little unsure after I finished cooking the sauce in the crockpot because it looked a little too watery, but after the addition of the tomato paste, it was fantastic.  The texture was great and the flavor was better than store bought.  Thanks!

I made one half the recipe using lovely Roma tomatoes from my cousin's garden' (8 cups chopped). I neither peeled nor seeded them. Unfortunately I did not have the individual spices so I used 2T of an "Italian Spice" blend. (I think I may have over-spiced) After the tomotoes had cooked for about two hours on the stove  in a heavy deep pot, I added a very small can of tomato sauce rather than the tomato paste and I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used my hand blender on the sauce for a couple minutes. The result was a tasty, thick, relatively smooth sauce -- slightly over spiced. It is now frozen waiting to be spooned onto spagetti when I visit my grandchildren next month. I would make it again after acquiring the individual spices.

Love this!  I have made this for several years in a row.  I just throw everything in at once (except for the oil I omit that) and let it sit in the crockpot all day.  I also take kale and blend it to a liquid and add it in.  My Son hates to eat "green" things so I have to hide it.  Doesn't change the flavor at all, but adds extra vitamins.  I also put in the cans of tomato paste at the end and put the sauce into canning jars to seal.  Ready to serve!

Way too sweet, even with cutting sugar to only 2T (had to add almost 2T cocoa to cut sweetness)!  Also, seasoning (except salt) amounts need to be doubled.  That being said, it's an excellent base recipe that's my go-to (with the above noted changes) for spaghetti sauce.

This is the best recipe.  I freeze almost all my tomatoes in sauce every summer.  I use recycled yogurt containers that hold just the right amount for whatever I'm making.  I use my regular or immersion blender at the end to make the sauce smooth, skins and seeds included.

Turned out really well!  I will make again.  I'll probably cut back the sugar a bit because we felt it was a touch sweet, but that may be personal preference.  1 batch = 1 FULL pot of sauce!

Made this sauce as written .  Used half without adding the tomato paste over pasta with crumbled bacon and a little Parmesan on top.  Excellent.  Froze the other half and will add the paste to it.  Will make again.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I just tasted this as I'm waiting for it to cook down and it is amazing!  I am cooking mine in a stockpot on the stove.  I also blanched and peeled the tomatoes as well as added a bit of red bell pepper that I wanted to use up.  I only put 1 tbls. of the basil in because of personal preference. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

great recipe.  We wanted to freeze some sauce instead of canning and this was the best recipe.  Took the advice of some other reviews and went a little heavy on the paste for a thicker sauce (our preference).  Have made this 3 times now and not disappointed.  YUMMY

What a great way to use all the tomatoes from the garden. I halved this recipe and actually let it cook on low in the crockpot all night. I omitted the parsley as I didn't have any, used fresh basil instead of dried and cut the onion back to 1 large instead of 2. I also used a whole can of tomato paste even though I halved the recipe because it was watery. AMAZING! So glad I decided to try this. Thank you!

My teenage son agrees.
I don't like canning, so it's a perfect alternative.

This turned out great although I would use less salt next time.  I added roasted red peppers, and I roasted a bulb of garlic instead of the chopped garlic.  I also used mainly red onions instead of white.  I cooked it on low in an open pot for several hours and it thickened up really well.  Then I pureed it with my immersion blender.  Will definitely make it again but will use less salt next time.  no need for tomato paste.

Just made it last night and the flavor is phenomenal. It's very easy to make especially with the slow cooker.

I make this with tomatoes for my garden every year.  my husband loves it and only let's me use it (from the freezer) on special occasions.  I add the tomato paste at the same time as everything else.  And sometimes I add some nice red wine...yummmm!!!!

Wonderful! This year was my first time making spaghetti sauce from scratch. After simmering it on the stove-top in my dutch over for over four hours and cracking the lid for a couple of those hours, I ended up with 4 quarts. The only modifications (other than cooking it on the stovetop) were the additions of a cup of red whine, a couple carrots, a 1/2 tsp of dried pepper flakes, and the the use of fresh parsley. It was still a little sweet for me but will adjust for the sweetness later when I take it out of the freezer and prepare it for dinner.

Yummy!  I changed it quite a bit... halved the recipe, doubled the tomato paste (since many people said it was watery), added a bay leaf and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I also sauteed 1 ob of ground beef along with 1 lb mushrooms, 2 onions, and 1 T garlic.  I added it all the the crockpot and let simmer on low 4 hours.  The flavor was good, but the sauce was still watery, so I transferred it to the stovetop and simmered it uncovered for about 1 hour.  I think that thickened it up nicely.  :-)

Awesome base recipe!  Here's what I did to make it (in my opinion) even better!  1) scored, blanched and peeled the tomatoes first 2)  In addition to green pepper, added either crushed red pepper or one, hot pepper, seeds removed. 3) Added a ton of fresh basil instead of dried. 4) added tomato paste early on 5) simmered on low in crock pot for 6 to 7 hours. 6) Used immersion blender to smooth out the sauce some before eating or storing. YUM!  Thanks, Stephanie!

A bit bland for our taste...I added a couple of partial jars of sauce I had in the fridge...and added some black pepper, cayanne, salt and garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  Puree'd in the blender after slow cooking. Delicious!

This was a nice sauce for freezing.  I made lasagna with the sauce and it was delicious.  I also used for spaghetti sauce and it was a little watery for me and could use a little more flavor.  Perfect with lasagna due to all the other flavors you add but if I make it for spaghetti again I will add a little extra garlic and onion when browning the meat...maybe even add a little extra italian seasonings at that time as well.  All iin all a great recipe to play with especially if you have a garden full of tomatoes!

Wonderful! None of it made it to the freezer! Added a HUGE zucchini (chopped) during the sautéed vegetable step. Served it over spaghetti squash. Hubby (aka Squash Hater) went back for seconds then thirds. Thank you!!!  The entire family now eats squash.

Great sauce! It is a simple recipe. Preparing the tomatoes does take some time, but it is easy. The flavor was fabulous and tasted garden fresh and healthy. I'm saving this one to make again and again.

Great sauce with great flavour, tastes of your harvest all year long!  The tip to add the tomato paste after you thaw is great as my previous tries at freezer sauces end up watery.    Will make again next year.

Great recipe. Keep the mess under control by using a slow cooker liner. 6 qt crockpot.  I sautéed the onions in a pan on the stove first to get them going then used the crock pot on high for an hour then turned it to low overnight. It makes it a nice rich color with a roasted taste.  I used red bell pepper instead of green for a sweeter taste. I have a 3 cup food processor which makes it a breeze once I peeled and coarsely sliced the veggies. Great use for the cheap bruised tomatoes at the produce stand. I cut it down to about 2 1/2 quarts. I reheated it with a small can of paste then gradually adding sauce to desired thickness. Fresh chopped basil and rosemary from the herb garden add character. Worked great with Cheese ravioli.

I loved that this was a nice big batch!  Uses up lots of tomatoes!  I just ran mine thru the juicer and then used 16 cups of juice for the recipe.  I also added the tomato paste, which added just the right amount of thickness and then canned it.  I cut the amount of sugar, as I don't care for a sweet sauce, but that is just personal preference.  Easy, tasty!  Hubby said better than you get in a restaurant!

Thumbs up! What a fresh and tasty spaghetti sauce! Just finished my 2nd batch this week - we have tons of fresh tomatoes from the garden. I did not put it in the slow cooker - simmered in a large stock pot on the stove top. (use a splatter screen over it) Also, I peeled, de-seeded and drained the chopped tomatoes in a colander first and added the tomato paste along with all other ingredients. I didn't have green peppers, so used yellow, orange & red bell peppers. Also, I omitted the sugar. This is a winner!

This recipe took some work but in the end came out very well. I cooked it about two hours and then ran it through the food processor. I would highly recommend this step as it gave it a much smoother consistency. I then split the recipe into thirds and froze two portions of it. I added about 6 oz of tomato paste to the remaining third of the recipe. This was too much as it made it too thick. I went back and added another can of stewed tomatoes and it was perfect. I also left out the parsley as I did not have any - I will add that next time I make it.

Holding back 1 star because I haven't tried adding the paste yet and it is very thin.  However, it smells and tastes quite good.  I used about half the sugar recommended.

I sauted the onions, garlic and green pepper on the stove before adding it to the crock pot.  I also only used 2 onions.  I used fresh basil and parsley from the garden, as well as 1 anaheim chili.  After cooking in the crockpot, it was still very tomato-y tasting so I moved it to the stove and simmered it for 2 more hours to blend the flavors better.  For dinner the next night, I pulled out 5 cups from the refrigerator and added the tomato paste and let that warm up - I added meatballs right before serving.  It was a hit.  I will definately make this again!

I've made it before with fresh tomatoes but today I tried it with a 90 ounce can plus a 28 ounce can  of Cento Organic Tomatoes.  I was just as pleased with the results and was happy for an easy, bulk sauce recipe that I can make and freeze in the winter.

I love this recipe as a guide. I live in Chile and at the end of our summer (mid February) I can buy 10 kilos (22lbs) for about a dollar, and I can't pass that up. I use fresh basil that I buy at market, double the garlic, and add a bit of red wine. I increase the slow cooker time to 14 hours. Needless to say, the house smells amazing. I use a potato masher instead of a blender and add about 6oz of tomato paste for every liter (quart) of thawed sauce. AMAZING. I use the sauce for spaghetti, lasagne, chili.... People have asked if I am going to sell it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

The flavour in this sauce is great.  There is definitely too much salt and sugar.  Also, to make this again I would definitely seed the tomatoes.  Not peel them, but definitely seed them.  There were way too many seeds in the sauce so I tried straining through a colander, but ended up losing a lot of pulp.  It is easier to quickly seed them before starting the cooking process.

there must be something wrong  with this recipe.  Super watery result.  If this is 32 servings, how do you add the 1 can of tomato paste when serving?  32 cans of paste?  i think that is what it would take to thicken this to what is pictured.

Great recipe. I blanched, peeled, and seeded my tomatoes. Besides cutting the sugar down I made no other changes. It tasted great but I think it would be a very forgiving recipe if you need to make substitutions or add things. This is the recipe I am definitely going to use from now on to freeze our garden tomatoes.

Made on the stove. Sauteed the onions and garlic first, then added remaining ingredients brought them to a boil and then did a long simmer. I'd cut the sugar next time as I didn't like my sauce that sweet, I was able to tame it down with black pepper and red pepper flakes.

Just made this for the second time. I love it. Got a bit sweet the second time. Added a shot of lime juice to it. It’s amazeballs. Thanks for the recipe. Tried to can my sauce once and it turned out tasting kinda burnt. Freezing is a way better option. And just toss it in the sink with warm water to thaw. Love it!!!

Easy...once I figure out how to peel the tomatoes (dip in hot water and then ice water, and the roma tomatoes just squeeze right out!)  Loved that I couldn't burn it because it was done in a crockpot.  Of course, we had to taste test! Yum.  I'll add some mushrooms and meat when we use it.

The flavor is delicious!  I peeled mine and squeezed half- still very juicy and thin. I also didn’t dice the tomatoes and they did somewhat break up but are very chunky. The flavor and consistency almost tastes like it would be great for stuffed pepper soup or chili. I added diced celery otherwise stuck close to the same ingredients (didn’t add much sugar). 
Delicious flavor!  Excited to eat it!

Impressive recipe. We used fresh basil instead of dry but did everything else the same. We did use home grown tomatoes. Towards the end we  used an emulsifier and simmered  until thickened.  Left chunky is  good on pasta or for chicken Parmesan. Less so is good for picky kids. I think the recipe's call for vegetable oil may have something to do  with the viscosity of olive oil  when frozen?  This  is tasty stuff.  We   let the  sauce and herbs  marinate sealed in the refrigerator for 48 hours before  freezing.  We will certainly use this recipe again.

Used garden tomatoes: cherry, roma & misc.  After all said & done, I pureed some to freeze for pizza sauce & froze rest with a small amount of pureed added back to sauce.  Haven't used it for pizza sauce yet, but had pasta with chunky sauce - I did  not add tomatoe paste & it was very good.  I cooked all on stovetop.

I made this with all of our Roma tomatoes we grew. Everyone loved it. Very fresh taste. i did blanche and peel the tomatoes and used my food processor for a smoother sauce. I read some of the other reviews about adding more tomato paste, and did that. I would make this again.

Super easy and tasty recipe!   We've made this many times and it is always a winner!  When the sauce has cooled, I puree' about half the batch in my blender to make it a bit smoother.  I don't peel the tomatoes , so I puree' it to blend in some of those chunks!

**Makes two quarts of sauce when making the recipe as written.

I made this yesterday with my plethora of garden tomatoes. OMG, it is awesome. I actually made the recipe as is, I used all of my "need to use" tomatoes from the garden. There were grape tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, beefsteak, etc. You name it, I put them in. I cut the big ones up, just tossed in the little ones. Left it on the stove on low for the afternoon, probably about 6 hours. I put it all in the blender and came away with a beautiful and tasty sauce. 
I did not add the meat, I figure I will do that on a recipe by recipe basis. No tomato sauce yet, again it will depend on what I'm using it for.

Certainly has some good flavour but, as others have said, I took it out of my slow cooker and finished it on the stove top.  It may well have been my tomatoes but the sauce was quite thin and I put it on the stove top and removed the lid to reduce it a bit.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a very pleasant vegetarian pasta sauce.  I think the addition of a little red wine would improve the richness of the flavour.

As others have indicated, this is a very good basic recipe.  I added jalapeños to add some heat.  No green pepper...I prefer the taste of red bell peppers so I added those instead.   I did sqeeze  out a lot of seeds and juice, but it was too thick...so next time I plan to leave in more juice.  I put it all in the crock pot on high for about two hours...then cooked it on low for about 4 more house with the lid off.  I added back in a little juice along with the paste.  Perfect.  Served with hot Italian sausage.  Big hit with my husband who grew all a of the tomatoes!

This sauce is fantastic! I made the recipe (as is) using a mixture of large grape and random other tomatoes from my garden. I too made it on the stove. I let it cool completely and puréed using my nutribullet, and all the skins/seeds disappeared! Seasoning is perfect. I did add 1 extra can of tomato paste too. This recipe is a keeper!

What an amazing flavor. I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the green peppers.  I halved the tomatoes and chopped them in my Ninja while the onions and garlic were sauteing .  I also simmered it on the stove for a couple of hours. My husband said it would also be good as  a tomato soup or a good soup starter.

I did half of the recipe and now wished I had made the whole thing.  Very good flavour, and am tempted to eat it tonight, was planning on bottling it.  Will leave it chunky, and depending on what pasta I use, I can always use the  emmersion blender to purée. Easy, very tasty, a keeper for sure. Well ladies, this is the tastiest sauc I have ever made, will be fav, now!!!!

Great sauce! A little less salt does the trick. I cook it in my 7 quart Dutch oven instead of a crockpot. My family unfortunately likes their sauce less chunky (what the heck is wrong with them?!!), so when it's done, I run it through my food processor for a few seconds. I've tried this with a variety of tomatoes from my garden. I throw whatever variety or mix of varieties  I have in there. I always blanch first then put in cold water bath to remove the peels first. I also squeeze most of the juice and seeds out.

I am simmering this right now in my stock pot. I had to make 1/2 the recipe because that's all the tomatoes I had.  This is my first time growing my own tomatoes AND first time making homemade sauce.  It is delicious!   So flavorful it doesn't even NEED meat!

I made a double batch first, just to try it. I did not peel the tomatoes. I only altered the recipe by adding twice as much garlic, ground turkey, and made in a big stock pot on the stove. Best sauce I've ever made. Next batch I used 40 cups of tomatoes. Great recipe and even my teenagers commented on how good it was.

I have learned over the years that I always burn the bottom on the stove, my crock pot boils on keep warm so now my spaghetti sauces go in the oven or a double boiler to control the temperature. Love this recipe, only change is fresh basil and more garlic (we love fresh garlic, Want to try the roasted though). Love all the reviews and tips. Definitely a favorite for my recipe file. I cook my meatballs in the sauce to keep them from tasting dry per another tip on this website from a traditional Italian cook.  Tomatoes and fresh garlic abound in California, I feel so blessed.

I've made this twice now & it's a big hit. The only change I made was to leave out the green peppers since my husband & I don't care for them. Other than that, I didn't change anything. 

I've used it twice for pasta and tonight I'm going to use it to cook chicken cutlets. I have no doubt it will be delicious.

3/12/19

Just an update: Since my earlier review, I've made this dozens of times and it's always a hit & always delicious! Whether used for chicken parm, eggplant parm, add meatballs, some anchovies, black olives etc., to make a putanesca, it's always good. It's a thick, chunky sauce out of the cooker when you add tomato paste. Put it in a blender/food processor if you need a smoother sauce. It's "unruinable."

I want to thank "Stephanie" for this recipe. It is my all time favorite pasta sauce, and I have been making it for years.  I don't use the crockpot method. I cook it slowly on the stovetop.   I've frozen it, canned it and served it up fresh for a banquet feast.  I've used fresh and canned tomatoes and it  turns out good either way (although the time I used my fresh heirloom tomatoes it was absolute ambrosia). Leave out the salt, it doesn't need it, and leaving the tomato paste out until it is thawed...or reheated for serving is the key to the lovely consistency of the sauce.  That's when I add some browned hamburger or Italian Sausage...nummers!

I made this the other day and it turned out fantastic. The only changes I made is I slow cooked it five hours rather then three but that is only because my tomatoes were not perfectly ripe. At the end I did end up putting in a small can of tomato paste. I put the sauce into four 1 liter canning jars rather then freezing. . I find freezing changes the flavour of food when defrosted. Anyway it is definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you.

This was awesome!! Used this to make lasagna and it was my best pan ever I think!! I didn't have enough raw tomatoes so I sub'd in 4 cans of plain diced and simmered on the stove top for 3 hours. Also added some chopped up zucchini since I like chunkier spaghetti sauce and needed to use them up before they went bad. Will definitely be making this again!! Can't wait to have an over abundance of tomatoes from my garden.

This was a great recipe to use up end-of-season garden tomatoes.  I made minimal changes - I cooked it on the stovetop and let it reduce for several hours, so I only used half the salt.  I also left out the green pepper (didn't have any on hand) and threw in a couple of hot banana peppers from the garden.  The sauce was delicious, and it will be nice to have a taste of summer during those long winter months of terrible grocery store tomatoes!

I didn't have any oregano, so I added basil, thyme and bay leaves instead. I'll add oregano, along with the others, next time. I pureed the sauce with my immersion blender (personal preference) and added 3 (6oz) cans of paste to the  sauce before freezing. I added a pound of ground, but the sauce doesn't need it. It was wonderful. So much better than grocery store sauce and super easy. I have many tomatoes in the freezer to make this all winter long!

I used fresh tomatoes, onions and peppers from our garden.
The only changes I made, did not sauté the veggies and doubled the recipe. It turned out awesome cooking for 9 hours on low!  This is favorite "keeper" for next season.

I did the slow cooker of tomatoes as directed.  When I took out of freezer to finish making sauce I added 1 small can tomato pasted and I 8oz can tomato sauce.  The only change I will make when making again is add a little more sugar.  My family likes a little sweeter sauce but other than that was easy and simple to make.  Instead of using quart jar to freeze used quart size freezer bag as that saved space in freezer.

I liked the flavor. I don't care for the skins floating around in the sauce. I cooked it all night meaning a good 12 hrs on low. The next time I will puree the tomatoes with the skins and seeds and see what happens. It definitely looks like a chunky marinara sauce. I will freeze it and then add Italian sausage or grd. beef when I'm ready to eat it. Good way to use an abundance of tomatoes. I followed the instructions in the AR magazine.

I followed the recipe except I scalded the tomatoes to remove the skins and after cooking the sauce I puréed it. Turned out beautifully.  Wanted to give some away so I canned it in pint jars.  8 pints. Thanks Stephanie! I will do this again.

Faced with an abundance of tomatoes in the garden, I decided to make this recipe.  Lots of them were too small to peel, so I put all the veggies in the food processor, skipped the saute step and cooked all of it in a large cast iron Dutch oven, on very low heat for about 2 hours.  I went ahead and put the tomato paste into the pot with some added water and simmered it with the rest of the sauce.  Seasonings were just right for us.

I made this recipe but added 1 lb. of ground beef to the batch. OH MY!  This is officially my new favorite spaghetti sauce as well as my husband's.  It is a great solution for the abundance of tomatoes we had from the garden this year!  It is so much better than any sauce you will buy in a can or jar... and it's very easy to make.  It takes some time, but it's totally worth it!  Yum!

I have used this recipe for several years now. I use the food processor to speed things up. The sauce is runny, so I strain the tomatoes with a fine strainer before & after cooking them. Delicious!

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic. I peeled my tomatoes and used fresh herbs but all other ingredients were as the recipe indicated. I split the batch, simmered half on stove top and the other half in slow cooker. The stove top batch was ready in about 3 hours, the suff in the slow cooker wasn't to a consistency that I like until about 4 hours. I made a meal right away and froze the remainder in 3 serving portions in freezer bags. My husband and I both loved the way the sauce turned out once the paste was added. Awesome recipe.

I needed to do something with the many tomatoes before leaving for vacation. Made this on a whim, so glad I did. It's a perfect, easy way to use the tomatoes that all ripen at the same time. I had Roma's , heirloom and even cherry tomatoes. Try this you won't be sorry.

Tasted great!  A great way to use the overabundance of fresh tomatoes at this time of year.  Also threw in part of a large zucchini and a can of mushrooms.  To use, I scramble-fried some hamburger with a few spices, added that can of tomato paste, then added this sauce.  A definite hit with the boys!

I only added about 1/4 tsp salt, and it tasted just fine.  I also cut the sugar back by 1/2.  You can always add a bit more salt or sugar at the end. Otherwise, with my modifications, it was a good recipe and helped my to use my abundance of garden tomatoes.

Excellent recipe! I didn't think it was difficult at all!  I enjoyed all the chopping. It smells amazing!  Love Love Love it! Thank you for such a great freezer sauce recipe, so much easier than canning! Great for our bounty of garden tomatoes! Can't wait to make more!

THE most perfecy spahgetti sauce recipe- such wonderful flavour, even my mother copied the recipe from me! Adding the paste is key when using it to thicken it up. I've used it in chillis, meat sauce or even lasangas and it's perfect. So glad I found it!

I made this yesterday and it was good. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I really was not a fan of the texture. I usually like marinara sauce to be on the chunky side, but this was just...strange. I took a little and put it in the food processor and even that didn't seem to help. It had a great taste though and once I figure out how to alter texture, I'll be making again! Thank you! :)

This is so easy and great to use up fresh end-of-summer tomatoes. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand, and the oil to keep it healthier, and it turned out great. I also just threw all into a large stock pot, and simmered down to the thickness I wanted. Then took my hand mixer/chopper and pureed it, adding the paste before freezing. My kitchen smelled like spaghetti sauce for 2 days!

This was delicious! I added in the tomato paste while the sauce cooked in the slow cooker, let it cook a bit longer and it thickened up.
