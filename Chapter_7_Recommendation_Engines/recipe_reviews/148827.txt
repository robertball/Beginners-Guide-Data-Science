To make these fit into our mexican-themed dinner night, I switched out the dill weed for cumin (I did cut it back to a teaspoon) and I added chili powder. I served them with homemade pico de gallo. Tasty!

These are so easy and so good! Plus they're much healthier for you than frying. I cut these with a pizza cutter to make them uniform. Instead of oil, I just sprayed them with olive oil flavored Pam, squeezed fresh lime juice over top then sprinkled the spices over them. I added also added a bit of salt. I baked these at 350 for 8 minutes turned them and baked for another 7 minutes. Everyone's oven is different so you may want to experiment with your first batch. These went great with fresh salsa and guacamole.

Wow I wasn't really expecting much from this recipe so it was shocking how good this salt free recipe really was. I was afraid it would be over seasoned but it was totally spot on! I make these quite a bit healthier by using just 1 tbs oil to have the spices form sort of a paste and spraying my tortilla's with Pam fat free olive oil spray before applying my seasoning paste. It spreads well and will still crisp up nicely yet make it so much healthier for you. When you bake please note that you have to watch them closely you have about 45 seconds from perfectly done until browned and over done. After making these for 4 or 5 days in a row I'm had to thow out 3 tray's because I didnt watch them closely. They should be crisp coming out and golden, if the bend a little they are under done and they will not harden more upon standing. It covered 2 1/2 10 inch tortilla's. I served this with crab dip for this site and cut smaller triangles. I cant wait to make them again! These would be a great substitute for croutons on a salad. I now have a reason to keep tortilla's on hand. Terrific guilt free snack enjoyed by kids and grown up alike. Much better than tostitos.

I don't mind dill weed, but this just did not work for me. I did use corn instead of flour tortillas, but that's because I prefer my tacos with corn tortillas and I didn't want to run back to the store when I had the rest of the ingredients already on hand. So this rating is based upon the flavor and not my choice of tortilla...Cooked them for 12 min and they came out golden brown, looked great, texture wasn't there. I will keep searching though for tortilla chip recipes

YUMMY!!! I always have trouble finding recipes for which i have the right ingredients, so this was a big hit. To make a long story short, i always end up substituting something for something that really shouldn't be in there. I was thrilled that i had all of the ingredients. One thing that I did wrong was that i cut the tortillas before brushing them, it would have gone a lot faster if I had brushed first .These were crispy, yummy, and utterly amazing! When i popped them out of the oven, the whole family came running to see what the spicy, aromatic, delicious smell wafting out of the kitchen was. Sure enough, everyone loved it!

These are good, but take at least 10 min to get crispy--perhaps a bit longer.  I put mine in for 10 min and some were still a bit chewy, especially in the middle.  I also ended up using 4 tortillas, not 2,  but I suppose I may have smaller tortillas than called for.  I like the combo of flavors.  I thought when making it that it calls for a lot of dill, but since I like dill I didn't worry about it.  A little different than purchased brands, and takes a little time, but delicious.  Thanks for a treat!

Great!  I had package of whole wheat tortillas in the freezer for over a year and finally found a use for them!!  I used white truffle oil and did add a little salt to the spice mixture!  Went fabulously with my homemade chicken soup!  Thanks!

Pretty good, but better with ranch dressing or hummus as a dip.

These are great! I used fresh dill and one garlic clove instead of dried/powder, and baked on a pan with little holes in it to aid with the goal of crispiness. 10m was perfect. They even convinced the early-to-bed husband to get back up for another half hr!   Another batch is in the oven now; this time I added a bit of cayenne. Great quick snack - this will become a staple I'm sure.

Average recipe.  The amount of spice/olive oil mix seemed too much for just two tortillas.  Even with the heavy amount of mix, they were more bland than I had hoped.

The recipe submitter is right... these ARE a great healthy snack.  10 minutes was spot on for my oven.  I did add a little bit of sea salt to mine.  Using a round pizza pan with holes worked out well for making these so crispy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are fun to make & yummy, but the spices either need to be divided by four, or use eight tortillas, because in real life the herb mixture is way more dense than in the picture.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chips were coated with herbs.  2nd time, I halved them and husband thought they were still too much (they still looked like a LOT, I'm talking dark green, not like the picture).  I will make these again but cut the herbs by four this time.  But, they are fun to make!

Very Good. I did end up adding some sea salt to them. Next time I will utilize my new herb garden and try these with fresh herbs. I made one batch and 10 minutes later had to make another one. Everyone liked them (even the kids) Great Snack. Thanks!

Simple recipe, just found that it is lacking something.  Maybe a little lime juice would help.  I have used a similar recipe off this site and if I am honest I would prefer it.

Yum! I cut the oil down to 1 tablespoon, mashed it into a paste,  sprayed my tortillas with cooking spray, then spread the seasonings on. Super tasty. Thanks!

These are so delicious I can barely stand it. I may not get the soup made tonight...these are distracting me! (Double batch of topping makes enough for 10 of the 6-inch tortillas.)

Very simple & tasty. I made just as stated. Keep an eye on them because they definitely can go from golden to dark brown in a matter of a minute. I used 3-8&1/2 in. tortillas and it covered just perfectly.

Loved em! But switched the dill for onion powder. Plus found that 12 minutes in the oven was perfect, and used 5 tortillas.

This was a great quick thing to make.  Really not that long to make.  I had to sub mediterranean herb spice mix instead of the dill weed.  Turned out ok.  I cant wait to try it will the dill.  Went great with salsa!

This was a pretty addictive snack - I made it and ate the whole batch within 30 minutes. It's not so much the flavor (I thought dill was an unusual choice here), so much as the "mouthfeel". I made it exactly as written, cutting the tortillas into eighths with a pizza cutter and baking them for the full 10 minutes. They came out slightly browned and quite (but not too) crunchy. They were definitely better when still warm, and got a little boring when cold. I'll be making this again soon, since I have lots of tortillas and dried dill weed on hand that I need to use up.

Good recipe, although way too much dill for our liking.  Now I just brush some olive oil on the tortillas and sprinkle the spice mix that I prefer - a little cumin, chili, garlic powder and salt, and touch of dill, and then cut with a pizza cutter.  Also, I use a cooling rack over a foil lined baking sheet for even toasting and easy clean up.

This was a great way to use leftover tortillas after taco night.  They had great flavor by themselves, but I served them with salsa.
