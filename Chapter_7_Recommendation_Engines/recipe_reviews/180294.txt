My cheesecake is horribly cracked in the middle!!! Like a huge Grand Canyon split going in several directions. What did I do wrong? I'm not blaming the recipe or giving it a bad review cause I know it can't be the recipe. Any big tips for this?

This was absolutely delicious and came together beautifully, resulting in a very tall, smooth, creamy and rich cheesecake.  Even though there were no cracks (used all the tricks - waterbath, greasing sides of springform pan, cooling slowly) I ended up topping with a strawberry glaze.  I actually think next time I'll use a 10" pan - this cheesecake looked very impressive, as it was tall, but it was so rich that a normal sized slice was almost too much to handle.  Otherwise, perfect flavor, texture and will definitely be repeated in our house.

Why do people rate awesome recipes like this one low stars when they didn't follow the recipe as written?  When it says to use cream cheese you assume not the fat free kind right? Someone gave this recipe 3 stars because they used fat free cream cheese- Fat free anything doesn't have that rich taste you need for a great outcome.  This recipe deserves all 5 stars!! I never made cheese cake this tasted just like the real deal! THE BEST!!

I want to give this five stars, but I have a rule about not giving five stars to recipes I have to make changes to. I am making an exception because in this case it's not the recipe's fault...sour cream is REALLY expensive and hard to find in Japan, so I substituted plain unsweetened yogurt for the sour cream and added one teaspoon of lemon juice to make up for the lack of "sour." This recipe still came out delicious. I made it into cheesecake cupcakes by putting a cookie into the bottom of each paper liner for the "crust" and then piling the filling on top. I baked them for 20 minutes in a water bath (it's worth it to read the "tips for cheesecake" on this site). They came out beautifully.

This is the closest recipe I could find. I used the Philadelpia Cream Cheese Classic Recipes cookbook. The only difference is 1c. grahm crackers, 3Tbls. butter; and 4 pkgs. of cream cheese. Otherwise it's the same. Excellent recipe.

Fantastic! I found that it's essential to make sure the ingredients are fully room temp. before starting to help avoid the dreaded crack. I made this the first time my in-laws came to visit, and they raved about it for days.

This has become my staple recipe.  I've tried some in the past that were too eggy, fluffy, or just too bland.  This one has the right amount of tang from the sour cream and a really dense dense texture.  The trick is to avoid overbaking it; i bake for an hour before shutting the oven off and letting it sit another 20 minutes.  I then crack the oven for another hour or so before finally moving it to the counter.  Eventually it makes it to the fridge where I cover it with saran wrap and leave it to set overnight.  This method prevents any cracking whatsoever and one is left with a smooth, vanilla creamy looking top.  FYI I only used 4 packages cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream this time as it was all I had, tasted excellent.  Reduced to 3 eggs and 2.5 tbsp of flour to reflect difference in sour cream/cream cheese.  I also used a shortbread pie crust as the base and it turned out excellent also.  Great hit, rave reviews, staple recipe!

I have used this recipe for years...the trick to good cheesecake is the same no matter what recipe you use   
1.cream cheese must be room temperature. I leave it out the night before, 
2.  On low speed blend the cream cheese and sugar until smooth before adding any other ingredient.   
3.use your scraper often to help mix ,stop the mixer half way through to scape all the cheese off the beaters and sides 
4. do not over mix, stay on low speed.  
5. cool the cheesecake slowly,don't refrigerate till it has reached room temp.
Good cheesecake is very dense and creamy, you do not want to beat it like a cake mix, over beating will make cheesecake cracked and tough.

This is the first Cheesecake I have made. I used a larger spring pan because that is all I had, but it worked out perfect. I was originally going to make Chantal's new york cheesecake from this site, but after reading the lowest reveiws, I decided to make this one. People complained of it not setting right and taste to much like sour cream. My husband does not like sour cream. So I chose this recipe because it had another package of creamcheese wich may balance out the sourcream taste and didn't have as many liquid ingredients so it should set just fine. But I did use the sugar amount from the other recipe which was a half a cup more. It turned out perfect. My husband said it tasted better then most restaraunt cheesecakes he has had. We ate it late last night and this morning and half of it is gone now and we are a small family of three with our daughter only a year and a half old. The cake probably won't see tomarrow.

I always had problems with my cheesecake cracking, that is until I watched alton brown explain cheesecake is more like a custard, so when baking cover outside of spring form pan with aluminum foil to keep water out,  set in a large roasting pan pan and fill with HOT water level with the batter...or as high as you can...turn off oven and leave cracked, let the cake cool before removing, end result is the most amazing textured cake without cracks!

This was the 2nd cheesecake I'd ever baked, and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in a shallow water bath, then let it cool in the hot oven for an hour after it was done baking. It turned out perfectly, lightly browned on top, and firm with no cracks!

I pulled out an old Philly recipe I have from a magazine clipping. It calls for 5 - 8 oz packages (226 grams). In Canada the size Philly they sell is 250 grams. THIS recipe is based for the Canada measure of Philly. 

Also, a lot of people are complaining about their results.  If you do not bring the cheese and eggs to room temperature your cake will curdle. If you do not use a water-bath your cake will crack. 

This is an amazing recipe, don't blame the recipe when it should be blamed on "cook-error" and give it a low rating.

Got crack?  This recipe is GREAT!  If your cake cracks badly then here's a secret to making cheese cake... Place your spring pan on a cookie sheet with water in it.  Make a little aluminum foil 'bowl' for your cake pan to sit in so no water touches the pan.  This will solve your crack issues.  Will come out silky smooth!

This cheesecake was awesome.  Next time I will add a little sugar to the graham cracker crust.  The package on the graham crackers says to add 3 TBS of sugar - I didn't as I followed this recipe exactly, but the crust wasn't sweet enough.  Also, I did bake in a water bath and the cheesecake came out perfect.

I made this cheesecake a few days ago. I cut the recipe in 1/2 to make 1 cheesecake. It called for 5 packages of Cream cheese, however I used 2, instead of 2.5 (I didnt want to waste) and it turned out to be the most TASTY cheesecake ever! I baked it for 1 hour and yes, there was a crack down the middle, then I refrigerated it overnight and you couldnt even see the crack after the cheesecake fell into place.  The taste was AMAZING! its so creamy and rich. Its the way cheesecake should be. If you want something light and fluffy, then try a tiramisu, not a cheesecake.

FYI-I used a ready made crust which is why I cut the recipe in 1/2. its much smaller than the springboard pan.

Excellent! If you want a super rich, dense and creamy cheesecake, look no further, you have found it! I followed the recipe exactly, however, I wanted to bring it to a large gathering so I doubled just the crust and pressed it into a 9x13 glass pan. I baked the crust for about 9 minutes and the cheesecake for about 35 min. I checked the center with my instant read thermometer and turned the oven off when it read 160 degrees in the center of the cheesecake. For the topping, I mixed 2 cups fresh bllueberries with 1 cup fresh blackberries and a 1/2 cup sugar and slightly cooked them, adding a TBL of cornstarch and 2 TBL water at the end to thicken. It was delicious!!

This was good and perhaps could have gotten more stars but I made it with low fat cream cheese.   I round it was not smooth enough texture wise nor did it melt in my mouth.   I'm picky though...everyone else loved it.  I'll keep looking.

Years ago, I made a quest for the perfect cheesecake recipe and made small changes to the one I found in the box.  This is the same thing I came up with except I'll put a tablespoon of lemon juice too.  Mine always cracks because I don't put a pan of water in the oven and let it cool in the oven, but lemon frosting, chocolate, or cherries make that go away.

I rate this as a 5-star recipe. The ease of creating this cheesecake and the rich, creamy, smoothness of it make it worth all the effort. If you bake it in the springform pan in an aluminum pan of two inches of water, your cheesecake will not crack. To me, the longer it sits in the refrigerator, the better it becomes.

This is THE BEST cheesecake recipe EVER.  I don't use anything else.  Easy and delicious.  But I would bake it in a 10 inch pan instead of a nine inch.  When I used a 9 inch it spilled over the sides into my oven.  A waste of deliciousness.....

I did not care for this recipe!  The only thing that differed in my ingredients was that 2 of the boxes of cream cheese were 1/3 less fat, otherwise I followed directions exactly.  The texture reminded me of curdled milk.  It was only slightly sweet.  I wanted to try a "New York" style cheesecake so I tried this one.  I'll stick with the "mini cheesecake" recipe from this site it is very good.

So easy , super moist and tastes really good.   Baked in a water bath and after cooking i let it cool in the oven for an hour with the door open before I put it in the fridge over night.

This is an OUTSTANDING recipe. I couldn't wait to dig in and cut it only after one hour in the fridge. I couldn't resist. It's rich with a very light but dense texture.  I baked the cake at 500 degrees for 10 minutes and then reduced the heat to 200 and baked for an hour and 40 minutes (when a thermometer inserted into filling read 150 degrees). That's the only difference.  I've read that after pouring the mixture into the pan, dropping it from an inch or so above the countertop forces air bubbles to the top. Greasing the sides before pouring and covering the cake with a bowl during the countertop cooling phase will prevent cracking. I forgot to grease the sides and am fairly certain that's why I got a crack.  :) Two thumbs up! Awesome recipe. Easy too!

I made a double batch expecting to make 2 cheese cakes and ended up with 4. Great recipe but if you are using a store bought 9 in crust expect to have extra.

I use this and Chantal's recipe. Both are great. I discovered though, that no matter how closely you follow the recipe the cake may still crack (my first one had a crack right in the center :( ) To prevent this put the cheesecake in a waterbath--it defintiely helps. The first time I used a waterbath my cake came out perfect. !! :)

This turned out delicious. Great texture and flavor, but it did take me two tries. After printing the recipe and reading other's reviews and the tips on making a perfect cheesecake I was under the false impression I should bake this in a waterbath. The waterbath did not allow the center to set (even though that didn't slow anybody down from eating it). The second time I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it was perfect. No waterbath, no extra time in the oven, make it just as the recipe says and you will have a perfect cheesecake!

Made this because I had some cherries and sour cream to use up. Made it as bars and had some BIG time cracks, but turned out to be pretty tasty for my first ever cheesecake.

This recipe was disappointing. We followed the recipe exactly and it was not good at all. I think it is the flour.

First of all kraft needs to up date receipe due to the fact that it calls for 250g packages of cream cheese, and they now make the packages with only 226 g per package. I had to re-calculate the grams to make the cake to make it correctly. I also followed it to a T and my cake came out cracked like crazy. I made this for a Christmas desert for friends and was not impressed with the looks or taste at all. Kraft is NOT a name you can trust!

Good, not great. Not sweet enough, too heavy. Would not make again.

Helpful tip: If you like a high cheesecake, do check your pan size. 
-Not all cheesecake/springform pans are the same size Some are 9" some are 9/34" some are 10". These all affect baking times and outcome of height of the cheesecake. Larger pans take less time, and a 9" pan make take more according to your oven temperature. 
I recommend using an oven thermometer. Cakes turn out better if the oven gets a through pre-heat. Be sure to pre-heating the oven for 15min before putting in any cake. You'll get better results.

i found just a little too strong on the sour cream was easily fixed by adding one more pack of cream cheese i personally like mine with the cracks so i cook it till then but for those of you having trouble just cook it lower heat or less time always gets compliments i use chocolate crumbs and sometimes cheat and buy oreo crumb pie crust it makes three of those perfect for parties

Loved this!  The only change I made was to double the crust (added 3 minutes when I baked the crust) and placed a pan of water to the oven while the cheesecake baked.  No cracks, beautiful cheesecake!  Taste was nice and creamy and cut beautifully...This is a really rich cheesecake, LOTS of calories but is great for a special occasion...I will certainly make this one again.....

Absolute perfection! Served for Easter & everyone raved over it. I made it exactly as directed and wouldn't change anything. I  was worried that it seemed kind of soft right out of the oven but after refrigerating overnight it firmed up great. To top the cheesecake I used 1 lb cut up strawberries mixed with 1/2 cup sugar & 1 tsp cornstarch and refrigerate overnight for syrup to form.

This was incredible!!!  I made this for my husbands birthday and everyone enjoyed it!  When I made it the second time I made the mistake of using the other Philadelphia Cheesecake Recipes (this is III).  The other calls for 1/4 c. less graham cracker crumbs and adds sugar and flour to it.  I found that it made the crust drier and stuck to the pan.  I used canned cherries but the cheesecake can stand alone.  The fruit topping is just a bonus.

I never made a cheesecake before today because I always had the impression that it would be really hard to do, but l was wrong. It was easy! (The only reason I made it this time was because the store didn't have any plain cheesecakes, so I had no choice!) This recipe made a little more than would fit in the 9" springform pan, so I baked the extra in a small pie plate, which got taste tested by us all. Very good cake! The cake with strawberries on top is delicious :)

I love this cheesecake. I have been making them for a fund raiser for a friend. Everyone raves about it. I to had problems at first with it cracking but I started putting it in a water bath and cut the cooking time down by 4 mins. They now turn out beautiful! Another trick to keep this cake from cracking is to make sure you grease the sides of your spring form pan.. Mine never come out cracked but when it cools and sinks down some in the pan is when it pull apart in the pan this and carefully run a thin knife or spatula around the sides when you take it out of the oven..

It was my first time making a cheesecake and it turned out wonderful! Sour cream is very hard to find in Japan so I used a yogurt, lemon, and lemon zest. You can make the yogurt simillar to sour cream by getting the liquidity stuff out using a paper towel.

A great recipe! The only thing that I changed was I used 3 1/2 packages of cream cheese. 5 packages are too much for me. I followed all the rules in making cheesecake and they worked! I made Oreo Cheesecake. Used 12 Oreo sandwiches, split the top biscuit from the bottom, peel off the vanilla cream in the middle. Pour 1/3 of the cheese mixture, and layer with oreo ( do not crush them), then, another 1/3 cheese mixture, and put the oreo biscuit, and another 1/3 cheese with oreo again. cover the top oreo with leftover cheese mixture. I made this for my boyfriend, and all his friends loved it!

Oh My Gosh! This cheesecake is so DELICIOUS! Wonderfully creamy and dense. Make sure to cook in a hot water bath for minimal cracking :)

Awesome recipe... best one I've tried so far! Absolutely no criticism, but I did use a 10 inch pan as someone else suggested.

Okay I believe that cheesecake is supposed to be rich, creamy and tall. I thought this cheese cake was to short to eggy and not as tall.  I don't think I will use this recipe again. When I was reading the reviews I was so excited because everyone said it was so good and their guest raved about it. I didn't get that my guests said it was good. I will have to post a recipe for you which is the best I had. I chose this one because it was easy and did not have so much prep time. All in all I guess its all right.

this tasted too eggy.  Mine tasted almost like a custard.   For those people that said their cheesecake cracked, wrap foil around the springform pan.  Then put it in a roasting pan with warm water about halfway to the springform pan.  Then when it's done cooking, leave it in the oven for a couple of hours with the door cracked open.  One thing I'll say about this is that it did not crack!

@Gilletten   Usually cracks are caused from beating the eggs too much.. You can prevent the cracks by adding a small amount of cornstarch to the batter. You can also add a roasting pan full of water under the cheesecake.

This is a New York style cheesecake.  Very easy recipe and it was absolutely delicious!  I cut the baking time down to 50 minutes but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I also made the "Supreme Strawberry Topping" which was a perfect topping for this cheesecake.

I love NY style cheesecake ever since I worked at a Nathan's Famous fast food place in CA almost 30 years ago.  They shipped their cheesecake from New York and sold it in the restaurant.  I have made this recipe several times and have had people ask me to make it and they would pay me.  I think this is THE BEST cheesecake I have ever had.  No fruit on top please.

This was the very first cheesecake I’ve ever made and after reading through a few recipes and YouTubing a “water bath”, it turned out AMAZING!!  I ended up buying extra wide foil, so there wouldn’t be any seams in the foil to let water through.  

It almost makes to much batter for the 9” pan, but it ended up being perfect.  At 1 hour 5 minutes i took the temperature and it was 138, so I left it in for 8 more minute and it was 151. Perfect.  Cooled in the over with the door open for  4-5 hours then put in the fridge. Left in fridge overnight and didn’t add cherry topping until ready to serve. Perfect texture, taste, consistency and no cracking!

The flavor and texture was spot on and the only thing that could've possibly made it better is a bit of lemon zest in the filling. I did the water bath trick but I only filled the water up to about an inch and it still didn't crack. Also, if you're using blocks that are 227g, make sure you add another half block to make up for the 115g difference. The one problem I had was that the filling was kind of thick so I had to really smooth down the top and when I took it out of the springform there were visible air bubbles/gaps on the sides

I make this cheesecake and then before I serve drizzle melted dark chocolate and a raspberry sauce on each piece( according to my guests' preferences). It is always a hit.

1 use 3 pkgs 1/3 or half fat and 3 pkgs regular for a total of 6 pkgs, not the 5 in this recipe. I Also add fresh lemon juice and use low fat sour cream and add about 1/4 extra and beat the  out of it.  It comes out light, fluffy like a mousse or Soufflé. (we don't like that heavy,dense NY cheesecake)  I also order organic sugar-free pie filling instead of that canned pie  you get at your local grocery store.  I order Cherry, Raspberry and Blueberry.  I slice, serve and guests can top with whatever fruit topping they like.

First a little background to qualify my review.  I have limited experience baking cheese cakes.  I have lots of experience eating cheese cake.  My preference is thick, creamy, little to no crust and no topping cheesecake.  This recipe fits the bill perfectly.

It is 2" tall, very thick and deliciously creamy.  In order to not even run the risk of cracking I did place pan inside a foil bowl inside a baking sheet with water.  And I left it in the oven for 2 hours after the required baking time.  It then cooled on the counter for another 30 and then into the fridge.

The husband, who  has the same preferences as me, loved it.  The only thing he suggested was a wee bit of lemon juice because he like that hint of lemon which this does not have.

The top did not even slightly brown which had me concerned it was not done but in fact it was.

L-O-V-E this recipe! Perfect EVERY time! I add different toppings depending on what I am in the mood for. Also, to the lady below who cracked her cheesecake: Its incredibly common to have this happen. There are certain reasons (temp, altitude, your oven) that can cause this to occur. A "water bath" type cooking technique can help you if this occurs when you cook cheesecake. You can "google" specific directions on what is best for your area/oven. But this recipe-- YUM!!!

one of the best recipes yet.  I do add a splash of lemon juice before beating in the eggs and this helps keep the smooth texture and keep it from being too sweet.

Delicious cheesecake everyone loved it as a Christmas dessert. The only issue I experienced was that I had to bake this for an additional 30-min. I baked at 300deg because my pan isn't silver (more of a brown/bronze color) so I figured it was similar to the darker pans. I was wrong, I will likely bake this at 325deg next time with my pan to cut down on the bake time.   I did experience some cracking on the top while it baked, but after taking it out and letting it cool, the top fell and the cracks weren't noticeable. Actually, I got a lot of comments on how I got it not to crack.

This turned out great and was very easy. I'll use strawberries next though instead of the cherry pie filling for a more original cheesecake. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe to a tee and my cake ended up having cracks in it. I let the cake cool in the oven for an hour even. Everyone loved it but next time I will try a different recipe. The cake seemed too heavy but it was still tasty!

This was my first-ever cheesecake attempt.  I must say I was quite proud.  I opted against the waterbath because I coulnd't get enough foil around the pan to keep it from leaking. only one little crack but I covered it with caramel and chocolate sauce drizzle and no one will know! Very very creamy and delicious, only change I would make would be to double the crust and add sweeten it. Otherwise will follow recipe exactly next time.

I made two of these for my aunt for easter dinner and they were a huge hit! I made one plain cheesecake and one which I mixed blackberry preserves in. Both turned out wonderful and were a cinch to make, the only thing I would caution is to be careful you don't mix the batter too much, otherwise air gets in and the cake rises too much in the oven and looks a little funny, still tastes awesome though!

I'm only giving it a 3 star because I have not tried the cheesecake yet, its cooling off in the oven right now, and I can tell you that the 9" spring pan is NOT big enough! it fluffed up so high, its ridiculous. Also, the timing for using the dark 9" spring pan is not accurate, it should be about 1 hour and 40 minutes to bake. So for those of you that have dark spring pans, make sure to bake longer. I added a tablespoon of lemon zest and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. I must say, I can't wait to try the cheesecake! My house smells so yummy!

This was my 1st time making a homemade cheesecake! I used blueberry and my husband just loved it! He said that it was just like he mom used to make. He just wishes it had a thicker grahm cracker crust, so next time I will double that part of the recipe. This is a great cake!

This was the first time I made a cheesecake and it turned out wonderful. I was careful not to over beat the cream cheese, all my ingredients were room temp, and I buttered the sides of a 9 x 13 Pyrex pan, which worked well since I didn't have the proper pan. I didn't use a water bath, and I took it out of the oven two hours after cooking (needed the oven). Yummy. Thank you.

Very good recipe and easy to make.  I substituted chocolate grahams for the crust and topped with raspberry compote and fresh raspberries and strawberries.  Also added more sugar to the filling, and even then it wasn't terribly sweet.

I followed the recipe exactly... I must have put too much air into the mix, cause there was a big crake down the middle.. but it tastes delicious!! My first time, and I’ll definitely be making this again. I would share a picture, but every last bite was eaten. 
Thanks for an easy great recipe!

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I'm not going to make it till the day before Christmas.  
My mother in law used to make this and it is so delicious.  I was looking for my copy of the recipe and it was "gone".  
Time to try All Recipes and I'm so glad I found the recipe.  Now my kids will be happy eating their "grandmas"  cheese cake with the cherry pie filling on top.

Big mistake for the lady who made it with low or no fat cream cheese.  This recipe is a classic and has been around for many years.

I have made this cheesecake for years.  I have learned with  cracked cheesecakes to cook them the temperature it says and turn the oven off...DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR.  I use a pan of hot water on the lower rack and I put the hot water in the pan when I start making the cheesecake.  I butter the pan just a little bit.  I leave the cheesecake in the oven sometimes overnight depending when I make it.  I never, never open the door because I have found the temperature causes them to crack.  I love this cheesecake recipe because it is not really too sweet.  My family loves them.  I love to make cheesecakes because they are a challenge to keep them from cracking.  I hope my hints will help you.  I did a lot of research before I ever made one and I was scared to make one, but I love to make them now.  I do not beat them for a long length of time.  Hope you have good luck with yours.

Waterbath-YES! FOIL- HECK NO! Oven Bag next time.

This made a cheesecake that was perfectly halfway between a creamy, soft cheesecake and those drier denser cheesecakes. The taste was equal or better than the best of any cheesecake I've eaten--Including the famous ones. (Carnegie, Juniors; I think cheesecake factory is mediocre)

My cooking times below reflect what would have been perfect--I futzed around a bit at the end checking for doneness, and I'm pretty sure the times below would be perfect.

I obsessively read many reviews of many recipes and decided on this one, with these minor modifications:

(used 5x 226g bars)
+1/8 cup sugar in custard
+1/2 Tablespoon Lemon Juice 
+2 Tbsp sugar in crust

Nobody should ever recommend foil as far as I'm concerned-- after the fact, I saw recommendations on oven roasting bags, and this makes far more sense. The water got in and made my crust soggy all around the edges. It was okay in the very center, and you can taste how amazing it would have been.

Added Hacks: 
*everything at room temp (2.5 hours)
*pre-scramble each egg right before adding; 
*mixer on LOWEST only, don't overmix
*stop often, scrape paddle and sides
*gently incorporate ingredients

Made the smoothest (and most delicious) batter I've ever tasted. No Air. The tiny little hint of lemon was nice.

notes: I used 4 layers of foil and made a water bath in a disposable roasting pan to the level of the custard..put water right off the boil in the pan right after it went into

I mean, I modified it as I went, two mix sets, four blocks of 8oz cream cheese each set, one chocolate, one orange, four eggs each - a little over-egging never hurt anyone. Less sugar by 1/2 and added a little bit of honey. Nice fluffy result, fresh raspberries blended in heavy cream on top, and go.

It was super easy and AWESOME. It didn't crack a bit thanks to reviewers who suggested using ingredients at room temp., greasing pan's sides and baking in water bath.  
I can't really say I made adjustments. The first time I used only 4 packages of cream cheese by mistake. It worked, so I decided to roll with it. 
The second time I used a 10 inch springform pan; IMO it worked better.

This was the first time I tried this recipe and the second attempt at making a cheesecake.  The cheesecake did crack a bit on top however I think it's because it stuck to rim of the pan and I didn't grease the pan that high. Lessons learned.     This was pretty easy to make and the instructions were easy to follow.  I would consider myself a beginner when it comes to baking.  I have heard cheesecake can be tough for a beginner but this recipe seemed like a good place to start!

Nothing but compliments for this. Awesome and creamy textured delight. I used the waterbaths, had ingredients and room temperature, greased the sides if the pan and never a crack acres

Made this in an muffin tin...used gingersnaps for the crust...They fit perfectly in the bottom of the tin.
Also added cherries, strawberries, and pineapples on top. This recipe makes about 36 cupcake size cheesecakes!! Yum!!

My 1st time making this followed the ingredients exactly however I altered the baking directions a bit and avoided the cracking of the top.

After baking for 1 hour 10 minuets I turned off the oven and opened the door, let cake sit in the oven that way for 1 hour so it could settle.

Then removed it from oven and put in refrigerator for 4 hours in pan, then removed the side of "spring form" pan.
Left in fridge for another couple hours to completely cool before covering with Saran wrap over night.

The cake came out perfectly.

Tasted amazing!!!!

We loved the recipe.  Made one mistake by forgetting to add sour cream as directed, but placed on top of cheesecake.  Next time as directed.

All gone in one day.  Thanks for recipe

This recipe was fabulous!
I followed other reviewers suggestions and put the pan in a foil bowl inside a water bath.  Turned oven off after one hour and opened the door for another hour.
Not a single crack with a smooth creamy texture.
This will be my new favorite recipe!
thanks for sharing it!

Delicious!! And oh so dense...one slice can fill up any stomach. Yes, there were cracks on the top, but this doesn't affect the taste at all (and really, no one minded, it still tasted amazing). I heard to fix the cracks you're apparently supposed to put it in a water bath or control the temperature better or something? Guess I'll have to make it again to find out! ;)

This is the best cheesecake I ever made! I used to make the easy no-bake with ready-made graham crust and Philly, whipped cream, etc. I was working and it was quick and easy. 
After tasting this one, I won't go back to the other.  It's worth the extra effort and time for a great dessert! Thanks

I am just now starting to bake, and I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake. It came out PERFECT. No cracks. No overflowing. I think  some of the cracking  MIGHT be due to rapid cooling? When I took it out of the oven I let it stand on the counter for a bit longer than it recommended before putting it in the refrigerator. Also, it went into my beer fridge, which isn't super cold and sat all night before serving. So to avoid cracking, maybe give yourself all the time in the world and dial back the cold a smidge? Good luck! Good recipe! Making it again right now!

This is absolutely, by far, the most delicious cheesecake I have ever tasted, and I'm including anything at the Cheescake Factory or any other restaurant, bakery or person known for their cheesecakes. My cousin made this, following the recipe, to a T, no low fat cream cheese, no light sour cream, and it was the airiest, fluffiest, melt-in-your-mouth, delicious cake you could have tasted!  There was no denseness to it, no cracking. Remember, this is key, ALL INGREDIENTS MUST BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO MAKE IT!

I let the cheesecake sit in the oven 5 to 6 hours after it was finished cooking, (oven door kept closed) to cool off. This helped with the cracking. Then I chilled it before serving

I loved it! Though I used only 4 packs of cream cheese and reduced the sour cream a bit. Instead of graham biscuits, I used Oreo cookies. It was delicious. Defiantly would redo end this to anyone.

This was a bit of a disaster! It overflowed the pan, has 3cracks, and is overdone around the edge. That being said, the flavor is great! I have made many cheesecakes & expected this to be a breeze. Despite following the instructions perfectly, including having room temp ingredients, it produced less than stellar results. I did not do a water bath, as the directions did not call for it & several reviews said they did not use one.  My thought is that if that type of alteration is needed, include it in the recipe.

Great recipe!! Family raved about it for days!
Minimum changes made: 3/4 cup sour cream, used regular graham crackers and used sugar with the crust.  Beat the eggs one by one on very slow mode. Baked the crust at 300F for 10 min then raised oven to 400F, baked cheesecake for 10 min at that temp then lowered to 200F for an hour. Left to cool in the oven for 3 hrs after cooking time. No water bath, no foil or special tricks. No Cracks either!! DO NOT OPEN THEN DOOR. UNTIL ITS ALL DONE. EVER. DO. NOT. BE. TEMPTED!! Enjoy the results!!

I have made this recipe several times now.  This time with a taller crust on the side. I'm still working on the cracking but the flavor is awesome.  Family and coworkers love it.  I will be using this recipe over and over again.   Thanks to everyone for all the tips, I'm using all of them.

This recipe is AMAZING!! It was easy to make and tastes rich and creamy! I added a little bit of lemon zest to the mix for a little extra zing...the only problem was I got a crack in the center of my cake... but that is most likely not the recipes fault. through advice of other reviewers I will try a water bath next time! :)

I have been making this recipe or years now and it is perfect! Cheesecake is not supposed to be real sweet and it is supposed to be heavy so if that's not what you want, then you really aren't looking to make cheesecake. My husband requests this every year for his birthday. His Grandmother who owns a restaurant even asked for my recipe. I do leave the ingredients out to be room temp, and I also mix by hand but that's just more work for me. I also leave it on the counter to cool till it reaches room temp, then put it in the fridge.

Turned out perfect.  What I didn't know was that the cheesecake could stay in the pan overnight.  I tried to unlatch the pan and the cake started to crack and wobble, so I quickly put it back together and it was fine in the morning. I did use a water bath.  There wouldn't have been any cracks if I would have left the cake in the pan longer.

I use this recipe every time I make it and I always make it for Thanksgiving. I was disappointed to not see it on the label (I have to look at it while I am in the store to make sure I have all of the ingredients). So thank goodness I found it online while my daughter was in the store!

Excellent. Was a little softer than I would have liked. I will definitely make this again. Big hit with the family, including the grandparents!

It baked up nice, but I didn't care for the texture and thought the crust was not sweet enough. My family loved it though, topped with cherry pie filling.  Other than that was a very easy recipe to follow and quick to put together.
