These brownie bites are melt in your mouth delicious! If you like peppermint, then these will not disappoint. You may consider reducing the peppermint candies by half if you'd prefer something more subtle, but I think the recipe is perfect!

I had a 22oz box of brownie mix with chocolate chunks I wanted to use up, so I made these and they were a huge hit! I put the crushed peppermints in them along with about 1/2tsp peppermint extract and didn’t put anything on top of them (but the powdered sugar) and they were FABULOUS! I’ll definitely be making these again

Made no changes EXCEPT instead of plain chocolate Kisses. I used the chocolate peppermint truffle Kisses as well as the red and white peppermint ones... This is so easy and the cookies are delicious.

These cookies did not last long on the Christmas eve dessert table. The downfall I had was that if they cooled to much it was hard for me to put the kisses into them, if it was to soon they melted so very quickly.  Although I did enjoy them melted down  into the cookies for me it let the flavors mix together a bit better. These are now a family favorite!

Loved these little gems! So easy to make. The brownie mix with syrup that I found was a 22 oz. package so I measured my mix to make sure I used the amount called for in the recipe. If you can't find the mix with syrup just use syrup. Delicious!

These are so delish and easy to make! I modified it a little. I bought the brownie mix that has chocolate chips, not syrup, so I added one more tablespoon water and oil to replace the syrup. I also did not put the crushed candy in there, thought it would be too much peppermint.  I’m on my 5th batch bc everyone loves them! Makes about 20 cookies per batch.

Not sure if it’s just the box I bought or if that’s the way it comes now in general, but the brownie mix I have is about 4oz bigger than the one listed in this recipe. I figured I’d have to make some adjustments and once I started mixing I could see that I would for sure. I did a double batch (2 boxes of mix) so I added an extra egg and 1T each of water and oil to combat the dryness. The cookies turned out flatter than what’s shown in the picture and I did have to cook them for a few extra minutes but OHHHH my goodness are they delicious! So so good! They’re chewy but soft and the flavor is excellent. I loved the tip about freezing the kisses before putting them on the cookies, that helped a lot. I’d love to figure out more accurate ratios for the liquids next time but I absolutely will make these again. I used a small Wilton cookie scoop and the double batch yielded 37 cookies total for me.

These got a 5 star considering I did everything wrong. I didn't have a brown mix that had the syrup pouch so I used what I had, a fudge brownie. I did add some high quality chocolate syrup though.  It was thicker than the syrup you get in the brownie package. Then I did add a little more water because I hard a hard time stirring it.  I also didn't have enough peppermint candy. When it came time to put the kisses on top I had the mint truffle kisses which were fantastic. The first batch I put the kisses on to early & melted.  The 2nd batch I forgot about & could hardly push in the cookie cause I waited to long.  With all this said we still would make again, but hopefully have everything on hand that is needed to do right & then don't multi task when baking them.  My dough was so hard that I probably wouldn't of had to refrigerate but it did make for easier rolling into balls.

Very good and easy to make. I didn't add the crushed peppermint candies, just added 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract.  It made 32 cookies.

Made these for work. I used about half of the peppermint recommended and it was lovely. A few tips, freeze the kisses before placing them in the warm cookies or they will melt and look weird. Also refrigerate between batches makes them hold their shape better

Yummy easy keeper recipe!  I only got 32 cookies instead of 48, will aim for 38-42 next time.  Also, the dough did not look like it had enough liquids, but just keep on mixing, it comes together like a cookie dough and then make sure to absolutely set it up in the fridge for an hour as instructed.  Also, I left them on the parchment paper to cool on racks.  Had to refrigerate the racks for about 10 minutes, after the cookies were completely cooled to be able to get the cookies to release.  They come off wonderfully with a little bit of chilling and sit at room temperature perfectly after that.  Will be making another batch tomorrow for hubs office, they are really wonderful !

I used Trader Joe's gluten-free brownie mix, and since it was a 16-oz package, I left out a tablespoon of water and used Hershey's chocolate syrup in the brown plastic bottle for the two tablespoons of syrup.  It was hard to keep the candies from melting off the top---even when I waited almost too long for them to make a dent in the top of the cooling cookies.  I will have to try this with the listed package of brownie mix next time, but I did need to satisfy my "customers."  These are delicious, and if you need something in a hurry to take somewhere, this is your deal!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!
