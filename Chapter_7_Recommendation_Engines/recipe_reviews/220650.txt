Well, I almost always cook from scratch, but let me tell you, this was terrific!  Could not be easier, with a nice balance of flavors.  Kids will like it because of taco seasoning influence.  I think there's an error in the recipe, though.  "Instant" rice should not take 20 minutes to cook as the recipe calls for; about 7 minutes is right.  I think you could make this with regular rice and follow the recipe that calls for 20 minutes of cooking.

I chose this recipe to add a photo to faceless recipes for the Allrecipes Allstars group. If looking for rice like one would get at a Mexican restaurant, this is pretty close. My only problem was it was a tad dry. I ended up adding about tsp. of vegetable oil at the end which helped. I didn't have V8, so I found a subtitute to do 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 water and it tasted very similar. I made broth from broth paste, so I could control the sodium. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about 4 servings. At the end I added some frozen defrosted peas and carrots for color and texture. ty

This recipe was great! despite the urge that i had to add beans, (because there is room for experimenting with other ingredients) I did not. I basically stuck to the recipe, with the exception of the cayenne, chili powder and splash of hot sauce that I added for extra spice. It was very quick, and really delicious, i will be making this again.

This was really easy and had a great flavor. I used 1/2 cup Rotel tomatoes instead of the V8 juice just for a little kick!! Thanks for sharing!!

I made this recipe tonight and my husband loved it!  He has tried many times to fix spanish rice but it always came out bland.  The only things I changed was: I diced up about a 1/4 cup of onion, 1/4 cup red bell, regular rice, and tomato sauce.  All in all...DELISH!

I thought it was great. I didn't have minute rice so I just had to cook it for about 20-35 minutes at the end. I also had to add more liquid.

I bought a generic store brand of V8.  I think it was too bland compared to what I remember for V8 and maybe that's why this recipe turned out too bland.  Thankfully, I tasted it ahead of time and "doctored" it up with spices.  It was also a bit dry so I aded some enchiladas sauce to it as well and people enjoyed it.  I served it with Angela's Chicken Enchiladas recipe (loved it) and Christmas Eve dinner was a success all in all.

I used half tomato sauce and half chicken broth instead of V8 juice and added cilantro. The cilantro gave it a lot of flavor.

Very nice recipe!  I used regular rice, 1 cup chicken broth to 1 cup enchilada sauce (no V8 juice available).  Sauted conion and garlic. Added 1 c of rice and sauted a few minutes.  Then sprinkled cumin and salt in the rice. Added to the boiling broth..cooked 22 min..You might go with 1 1/4 C of chicken and 3/4 cup of the enchilada sauce.  Next time will sauté green peppers and and black beans..Thanks for the recipe idea!

It’s very good and very easy to make, my family even skips the garlic and onion sometimes and uses seasoning substitutes instead and it turns out just as good.

I made this rice tonight, wanted something quick and easy to eat with tacos. I would have to say this was as good or better than some other recipes I have to make Spanish rice that take 3X's as long to prepare and sometimes don't turn out. I used Minute Rice brown rice which is a bit chewier, but still good. The taco seasoning I used was listed as "hot" when I bought it but lent a nice zing to the flavor. It was very good, I'll keep the recipe and make it again.

I have not tried this yet !! But with the ratings I read (Thanks by the way for the added ideas) I will try right away. My wife loves Tex/Mex rice. I like almost any thing spicy and EASY TOO ! Sounds like a winner.

Since I never use instant rice, I used regular rice (2 cups) and added some chicken broth and juice to compensate.  I also used frozen chopped onion/green peppers instead of fresh.  This is DELICIOUS.  However, I will make a smaller amount next time using the liquid/rice ratio I always use for regular rice.  My grandson devoured it and it is something that will be made over and over again.

Not the best rice we've ever had but really great for fast rice. My husband thought I got it out of a package but was the best I had ever made. Much better than packaged rice mixes. I used spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge.

This is my favorite Spanish Rice Recipe!  Easy instant rice dish to put together and it is a delicious side dish!  From time to time I substituted a can of Del Monte Tomato Sauce and a bit of water for the vegetable juice if that is what I happened to have on hand.  Either way, I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Used this recipe as a guideline-only. I started with regular cooked rice. Got the onion, garlic & green pepper chopped up & sauté going. Added the rice tomato sauce & a splash of chicken broth, taco powder. Let it simmer low while making the rest of taco dinner. Way better than the sodium laden off the shelf box mix.

With a few tweaks this paired well  with  my chicken enchiladas. Used tomato sauce instead of vegetable juice (didn’t have any on hand). Used bouillon cube  instead of broth (same difference), added a little cayenne for spice. Tasted pretty good.

This was okay, I used minute rice which I haven't had in about 20 years, think next time I will use real rice and adjust the cooking.  It was tasty though.

Very easy recipe , however, it's quite bland.   1 tsp. chili powder would also add  some extra pizzaz!  I also added 1 can of corn - with the juice - and 1 can of black beans - drained and rinsed.
