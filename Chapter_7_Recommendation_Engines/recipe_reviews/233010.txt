Thanks so much AR for correcting the amount of lemon juice!  You guys rock!    My submitted recipe called for 1/4 cup lemon juice- I let AR know about it an they corrected the recipe!  I recommend tossing the pesto with hot pasta so the cheese sort of melts and coats each strand.  You might want to reserve a ladle or two of hot pasta water so you can add a little while tossing if you want a saucier dish.

Just loved this recipe.  I used Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and capellini as the pasta.  After mixing the pesto with the pasta in the pasta pot I added additional grated Parmigiano and mozzarella.  Then replaced the lid and allowed the cheese to soften.  Will be making again.  Thank you Baking Nana for this recipe.

I made this last night because we felt like having pasta and had all the ingredients on hand. WOW, garlic overload! This recipe definitely has potential, but as is, the garlic is very overpowering. It was even more potent today when I reheated it for lunch.  I had a couple of people walk into the lunchroom at work and ask what was in the microwave. Don't get me wrong, this is delicious otherwise. I will definitely make this again but with half the amount of garlic.  I really liked the addition of the walnuts. A nice twist on traditional pesto.  This would be delicious with chicken or shrimp as an added protein to make it a complete meal.

I am surprised that we didn't like this more. My family is all over pesto and garlic. For some reason the garlic overpowered our dish- to the point it was spicy, really spicy. And we could hardly taste the lemon. I made this exactly as baking nana suggested.  No substitutions.  I am not sure what happened but this isn't for us.- update!! Just had the leftovers and this was DELISH.

Dd had  recently requested pesto and BN had just mentioned her Warning! on the Buzz so I decided to give this a whirl.  I had my head in a good book so I ended up mucking this up...over cooked my pasta a tad, over processed pesto, spinach wasn't really dry enough, not enough lemon juice (so I used all the zest of the one lemon I had.)  Still, with my poor execution dd  gave 2 thumbs up!

Wonderful! I also used Parmigiano instead of the Romano. My food processor wasn't working right, so I had to use the blender, which made for a smoother sauce than I would've liked, but the flavor is excellent! The little guy helped me make this, and he was eating it by the spoonfuls, lol. I was actually dipping bread in it, and that was delicious...can't wait to try it over the pasta. I make a lot of pesto to freeze in the summer, and this is definitely going to be one recipes that I will use~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Soooo good. This makes a really fast, easy, and delicious dinner. I toasted the walnuts and garlic before adding them; used farfalle instead of spaghetti; and added some chopped grape tomatoes. Paired this with a pork loin for a wonderful dinner! Thank you for the recipe!

I used cashews (because of a walnut allergy) and cut back the garlic to 3 cloves and the end result was perfect!  Thank you for sharing this recipe because I have never found one I like ready made from the store, and now I will be making this regularly for the family!

Delicious and fresh tasting sauce for pasta. However, I used less garlic as we don't care too much for it. Thank you for the recipe.

This was really good and all of the kids loved it. We paired it with lemon pepper grilled shrimp and roasted asparagus . Wasn't nearly as hard to make as I feared. This was my first attempt making a pesto and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't have a food processor, just a good electric chopper, and it did fine with blending all the ingredients. I did use less garlic as per some previous reviews suggested. This is going in my regular rotation of sides.

A little heavy on the garlic, but otherwise very tasty, plus, it's quick and tasty. I'll definitely be making this again.

I stopped liking pesto because it's so greasy and gross. This is a nice and light pesto recipe. Mainly uses spinach and a small amount  basil and oil. May want to adjust garlic amount. Otherwise is delicious and light with lemony flavor! Would be good with chicken.

Loved this! I was only making it for one person so I changed up the ingredient amounts. I also used what I had on hand bottled lemon and the cheap parm (I know, I know) but it was still so good! I'm a garlic nut so I used a lot. My Purple Basil is going crazy right now and this was a great way to use it. I also used a whole wheat pasta that I had. I'll be making this often, thanks for sharing the recipe.

We added 3 pan fried chicken breasts to this recipe. It seemed a little dry before we served it so we deglazed the chicken pan with a little water and added that until it was the right consistency (in lieu of using the pasta water like you would if keeping this recipe vegetarian.) I think we will increase the amount of pesto by about 50% next time since we like our pasta saucy.

So good! I made zoodles and cooked them in pan for about 5 minutes, drained the juice from them and tossed with this pesto. Hubby loved it!

this recipe has an unbearable amount of garlic, at least twice the proper amount, if not more. 2/5 stars because I hadn't eaten all day and the sauce is a pretty shade of green.

We followed the directions without changing anything.  We all thought the pasta was dry and pretty flavorless.  Maybe decreasing the spinach and increasing the basil and lemon would help...or maybe same amount of pesto to 2/3 the amount of pasta?  Oh well...it's still good to try new things and just because it wasn't our cup of tea doesn't mean other folks won't enjoy it.  Thanks

My family thought this recipe was fantastic and my mother asked for the recipe.  We did use only 4 cloves of garlic as we thought 6 would be excessive.  I also added in some pine nuts, as I did not have quite enough walnuts.  I blended it all in my Nutribullet , by adding ingredients a bit at a time.  I also did add almost 8 ounces of chicken broth as this device will not blend without some liquid.  I do not think the broth affected the over all flavor.  I will definitely make this again and will probably add some shrimp or chicken and maybe roasted tomatoes.  Yummy!

6 cloves is WAY too much garlic. 1 small clove is fine. I followed other reviews and reserved some pasta water to add to the final product. It really helps melt and incorporate everything. I use the whole lemon, zested and juiced. Great summer recipe! 1 star as written, 5 starts with less garlic.

Just watch out for the garlic. I didn't put in as much as it called for and it was STILL way too strong.....but, thats not the recipes fault, garlic can vary so much!

I love this recipe! It is so light and summery! The first time I made it, I tripled the lemon juice by accident, and it was to much, so I tried it again the next night! It is my husbands favorite dinner. :)

Nice and light. Very easy to make. I skipped the walnuts and just mixed all the ingredients in a blender. This keeps well in the fridge too.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I used all basil, no spinach, as suggested. Also I had no walnuts, so I used pecans. My food processor is of the tiny variety so I could only fit a half recipe in there. Glad I tried this, thanks for the recipe Baking Nana!

This was a good recipe! I agree with other reviewers to cut back on the amount of garlic. We like garlic, but it was a little too much. I'd also add a little more lemon. Will make this again! Very easy!

Possibly my new go to pesto recipe! Thank you! I was never a huge pesto fan, but figured I would try something I rarely make and stumbled upon this recipe. I will be making it again with out a doubt. Light, and full of flavor. I used some extra lemon, and pine nuts instead of walnuts because I had them on hand. I also marinated a couple chicken breasts in a chipotle  pepper mix, baked and then cubed and tossed that over the pasta. Very tasty!!

I love lemon and I love garlic, but this recipe had way,way too much garlic and lemon! I tried adding cream. Then I tried adding coconut oil. But it was still too sour and spicy.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I used the full 1/2 cup of lemon juice and it was wonderful.  Yes this is a lot of garlic and the taste was amazingly wonderful, but it might be a bit much for some.  In which case you can always adjust to 2 or 3 cloves if desired.  This pesto is extremely delicious as a spread for panini's (mozzarella and tomato for example).  5 stars without reservation! Will make it regularly and it will be good for company.  PLUS it was twice as delicious as leftover, even COLD.
