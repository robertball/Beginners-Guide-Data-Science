As the submitter of this recipe I just want to say that I have NEVER used bleach to sterilize the pans/utensils. Instead put an inch of water into the pot(s) add utensils and boil for 10 minutes. From my research I understand that the bleach leaves a taste unless utensils are rinsed over and over. Cheers.

Thanks for the recipe!! It turned out even though I was pretty sure it would not. I did not stir the whole time. I stirred every so often gently but I noticed that the whey went from the greenish-yellow clear color to a more cloudy one. I ended up using whole (3.25%) milk as well as 3.25% buttermilk. I also have an accurate thermometer. End product looks like the photo and is delicious!!!
