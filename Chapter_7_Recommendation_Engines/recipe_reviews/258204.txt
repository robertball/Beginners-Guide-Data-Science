After reading some of the reviews about it being runny and not wanting to throw out the solid portions, I just puréed mine after bringing to a boil and simmering 25 minutes. We liked it as was just boiled and puréed and didn’t add honey. I thought the consistency of it puréed was thick enough for syrup, could boil off some more water if thicker consistency desired.

I hardly ever give bad reviews because I believe taste is subjective, but I had to warn folks about this. This was as runny as water. I would never put it on pancakes.  Maybe the honey I used was too stong, but I used half the amount listed, and all I could taste was honey. No peach, just very runny honey.  Lots of work, and threw it out.

I only used this recipe as a guide because I had excess peach juice I did not want to waste. I noticed reviews stating the syrup was too thin and the same happened to me. So I added cornstarch to the mix while boiling and it turned out great!

Very easy recipe, not as thick as some syrup. May reduce water to help thicken next time. Great tasting & will use again.

Yummy sounding idea but, Didn't work for me at all. Never able to reach syrup consistency. Very weak tasting. Wasted good  local honey & peaches.
