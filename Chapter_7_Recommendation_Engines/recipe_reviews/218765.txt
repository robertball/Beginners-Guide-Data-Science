Simple and delicious! These are perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal!  I turned these into more of a twist on a classic BLT by adding some fresh sliced tomato and our favorite Swiss cheese with a little Hellman's lite mayo to take this over the top.  I used "Simply Guacamole" from this site which proved to be a good choice - nice and creamy without a lot of "extras" to take away from the overall sandwich.  Very tasty and yet another creative way to use those flaky Pillsbury Crescent rolls!

I couldn't fins the Pillsbury Crescent Recipe Creations so we used the crescents securing the edges. These are awesome. Everyone loves a crescent and they make the sandwich so tneder and add greately to the flavor. Tp us s sandwich isn't just stuff held together by bread, but an adventure. You have to consider the bread, the filling, cheese, condiments and naything else is so very important and using the crescent is a wonderful beginning. I will certainly make these again and plan to really do some serious experimenting to use the cresecent "bread" with different fillings.

These are fab!! I was very inspired to try many other ingredients. Added a slice of provolone and a smear of mayo (just because I like them and had them on hand)
Will definitely make again!

I am giving this 4 stars simply because of the IDEA of it.  Using the crescents for bread.  Genius!!!  Same flavor/texture of a croissant, but less mess, flaking and easier to bite.  I added "fillings" because that's what I do...LOL  I added sliced tomato, bacon, Duke's mayo, salt and pepper.  I did not use guacamole.  I simply sliced avocados and layered into the sandwich.  I also added in a little black forest ham, because that's what we like.

I made these, took a bite and thought they were missing something so I added mayo and sliced tomato.  It was just what the sandwich needed : )

Simple and easy to do. I was glad to try this one. My girls loved the guac on here in place of mayo or any other condiment. My guys don't like guac, so they were harder to please, but that's okay. There are so many possiblilities to making these flat bread crescents delish. I'll totally make again, because, it's fun and easy.

This was a surprisingly tasty sandwich. I really liked the crescent bread as an option to the usual sandwich bread or rolls we use. I made this as directed and my husband really enjoyed it. I added mayo to mine just because I like mayo with turkey. Made my own guacamole and used the rest with chips. Next time I am going to sprinkle the bread with herbs and cheese for a little extra pizazz.

I am also an AR Allstar and product promoter. Love the concept of this sandwich. The only modification was to add tomato slices. I don't have a pannini grill (don't want another shelved kitchen appliance!) so this was kind of a spin on a pannini sammie. Thank you, Pillsbury

This wasn't great for us. I made one with bacon and one without since I don't eat pork. The man did like the bacon one better, but not by much. overall, I felt that it was too much work for an okay sandwich. And, even though I used the reduced fat crescent rolls, it was still a lot of calories for the bread. I love sandwiches, but this one didn't do it for us. I did however learn that I love guacamole with turkey!

Delicious!! This is an excellant sandwich. I used the seamless dough sheet and sliced into 6 sections (for 3 adult sized sandwiches). The Crescent dough baked up perfect and made for a soft but not flimsy thinner sandwich roll whose ever so slighty sweet flavor blended well with the sandwich ingredients. Consider using the Crescent seamless dough sheets baked up fresh with a variety of sandwich fillings. You shouldn't be disappointed if you do.

These were absolutely delicious! They taste like something you would get at a restaurant or diner. The buttery flavor of the rolls meshed perfectly with the salty bacon and creamy guacamole. I loved these! So easy to make and perfect for a quick dinner. Why waste money at a diner when you can make sandwiches like this yourself?

I love any sandwich with bacon and avocado! Using the crescent rolls as bread is a neat idea. A nice change from standard sandwich bread. To make the guacamole, I simply smashed 1 avocado and mixed it with a couple pinches of salt and a splash of lemon juice. Sliced tomato and mayo were my own personal touches.

I'm a brand ambassador, and this was one of the recipes that we could select for the month of October.  I like the concept of this sandwich.  I added to mine by using a couple slices of tomato, and a slice of mozzarella cheese.  I decided to give the crescent dough more of a pop, by lightly spritzing the dough w/ grapeseed oil, and sprinkling on some lemon herb seasoning and garlic powder.  I also took a pumpkin shaped cookie cutter to cut out some of the dough for shaped sandwiches!

This was super easy and really good.  We added aged swiss slices, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used the Crescent "Sheets" and when I read to cut the dough into eighths I thought the sandwiches would be tiny, but they were not.  Nice change of pace for a quick sandwich meal.  Thanks!

These were pretty good!  I added tomato and cream cheese.  Hubby was really excited to eat his because this this type of sandwich is right up his alley, but there was just something about the bread that was a tad off for him.  He still gave it a four and I agree.

We all really enjoyed the combination of ingredients and the texture and flavor of the "bread". It also had a nice presentation. We didn't miss the cheese (that we always put in sandwiches) but I did add tomatoes because I had some I needed to use up. My husband asked me to make sandwiches with this "bread" again but for breakfast, like a bacon egg and cheese type of thing. This was a good variation from the norm.

I was surprised at what a great bread this made!  My family enjoyed these quick and fresh tasting sandwiches which can easily be tailored to suit individual tastes.  They even asked if I made the bread myself!

Good ingredients.  Try with different bread.
