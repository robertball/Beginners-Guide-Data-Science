The reason we gave these cookies a 4 star rating is that the amount of chocolate called for in the recipe is far too overpowering.  We scaled it back to 3 cups and it seemed to allow the almond and coconut flavors to blend in as well.  
We subsituted 3 cups unlbeached flour + 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and used sliced almonds.  Once we got the chocolate ratio right these cookies were fabulous!  Quick, easy, and freeze well.  A great quick addition to your recipe box.

Once modified this is a great recipe. I used only 2-1/2 cups of chocolate chips 2 tsp of vanilla extract, 2 tsp Coconut extract, added a full 14 oz bag of shredded coconut and only 4 cups of flour. Cooked for 13 minutes and allowed to fully cool. My wife couldn't keep her hands off them :)

This recipe is wonderful!  I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 7 1/2 minutes instead of 375 for 8 minutes.  They stayed soft and moist.  By far, they are one of the best cookies I've ever made.

Easy to make and delicious.  I only made half the recipe, which was plenty.  Other modifications: I didn't have any baking soda, so I used baking powder (1 tsp soda = 2 tsp powder), and omitted the salt.  I substituted half the vanilla with almond extract, added 1/4 cup extra coconut (because I wanted to finish my jar of it), and added about 1/2 cup less of chocolate chips than called for.  These really do taste like almond joy (at least with the almond extract and extra coconut in there), and are a really nice texture.  Will definitely make this one again!

Excellent cookie recipe Brenda. This will go in the favorites file. I used only 3 cups chocolate chips (mixed milk choc and semi sweet) and they were perfect. Oh yeah, I bought slivered almonds and toasted them. They added a wonderful nutty flavor. Thanks for a great new treat!

I made these for the opening of our new Church. These are the BEST cookies I've ever made! They are expensive but well worth it. I used a melon baller to drop them by and got beautiful, same size cookies. Got about 8 dozen. They freeze very well. I made cookies for about 6 weeks and these were just like they had just come out of the oven.

I agree with Mom of Three. Have same amount of chips, cocnut & nuts. If you don't have coconut try oatmeal that's also works.  Also,  cook at 350 degrees for 8 min. for a more moist cookie.   Great cookie!

Too much chocolate chips (can't find chocolate chips here in Holland easily, so I just chopped a bar of dark chocolate), and adding almond essence would be better than vanilla. I also added more coconut flakes. The first batch was a bit cake like, but with the second batch I flattened the dropped mounds a bit, lowered the temperature to 180 C and baked it for 15 minutes. It turned out VERY light and crunchy!

Everyone that has tried my cookies (this recipe) wanted the recipe.  Wonderful cookies.  I made them a little bigger than requested and cooked them a little longer.  I have placed this recipe in my Favorite Recipe's Journal.

I got rave reviews when I took these cookies to a party!  Instead of using semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate chips.  I also made my cookies bigger (about 4 inches wide when done) and baked them for 18 minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

This does not taste like an Almond Joy as the name suggests.  However, they were still very good.  Actually they went very quickly!  It is a different twist on the chocolate chip cookie.  Will make again.

This is the best cookie ever!  You need to modify/tweek the recipe though because 5 cups of chocolate chips is just waaaaayyyyyy to much.  You need to put equal amounts of walnuts and chocolate chips and coconut (1 bag each) seems to be sufficient.  Also, the cooking time is off.  It's 15 minute at 350 degrees otherwise GREAT COOKIE!

YUMMY!!!! Not too many chocolate chips like many said. I thought there were just enough.....I love that the cookies stay chewy. I did have to cook my cookies longer though, but I think because my cookie was made with a pampered chef scoop and they were bigger.
One of my new favorite cookie recipes.

Absolutely the best tasting and looking cookies I've ever made! They were so perfect that I even took a picture of them! I always recommend using parchment paper when baking cookies, it really made these turn out perfect! You will certainly enjoy! This recipe makes TONS of cookies!

These are excellent cookies!  Chewy, crispy, and sweet without being cloying.  I was out of almonds and added toffee bits, with no ill effect.  This will be our standard chipper recipe from now on.

These were excellent! The only change I made was to use 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup dark chocolate chips, half almonds and half pecans, and rapadura sugar in place of the brown sugar. Oh and I also added about a teaspoon of almond extract. This is a must try recipe! Delicious!

-Baked at 350 degrees for 8-9 minutes.  -Substituted 1/2 c. of cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 c. of butter...I couldn't tell!
-As recommended, cut choc chips down to 2 c. and they were chocolatey enough (and I love chocolate).  
-Used 1 c. coconut and subbed 1 c. oats and added a drop of coconut extract. 
-Subbed some wheat flour for the all-purpose.  
-I think my substitutions made the cookies a little healthier while still maintaining a great, tropical tasting cookie.

Will definitely not use so much vanilla extract next time. 2 teaspoons should be enough. I would also add more coconut and only use 3 cups of chocolate chips. I used milk chocolate and white chocolate chips instead and they were perfect.

These are really delicious!  I'm usually not that much a fan of CC cookies but I decided to make my father cookies for fathers' day and decided to try these for a compromise.  And they are very good.  They come out very upright and soft for reference.  I substituted hald my flour with wholewheat.  I also added some almond extract for personal preference and I'm glad I did as I think the almonds would only add texture otherwise.  Also the amount of chocolate in the recipe seemed pretty much overkill so I cut it a lot, just adding until it looked right in my bowl.

I've made these twice now, the second time for a potluck at work. This recipe made over 6 dozen cookies, and I only came home with about a dozen! I also had many requests for the recipe.

Like the other reviewers, I used almond extract (3 teaspoons) and coconut extract (3 teaspoons). It really improved the flavor. I also cut back the chocolate chips to 3 cups and increased the coconut and chopped almonds to 3 cups, based on my own personal preferences.

These cookies were excellent, but dried out quickly. I'll make smaller batches - but I will definitely be making more!!

The cookies were good, but they did not taste like an Almond Joy candy bar. Regardless of what I expected, the children ate them without question.

Although this recipe has the components of an Almond Joy candy bar they don't taste that much like one.  They are a different twist on the chocolate chip cookie though.

The place that I work has a cookie that is very similar with coconut, chocolate, and nuts. I've been dying to find something like it to make at home! I modified the recipie slightly by adding 1 cup oatmeal and eliminating 1 cup of flour. Turned out great...this one's a keeper!

I really played with this recipe. Instead I used raisins & some crushed pineapple only because I didn't have any chips...forget the vanilla & use the juice from the pineapple and add a litle extra butter...They tasted good. I wiish I would have had the chips though. I thought I did!! Kind of tropical good.

I must make Toll House CC more than most. It is double that recipe (and double the normal output of a cookie recipe). I had to adjust for 9,000 ft altitude so I halved the baking powder, added extra 1/2 cup flour, doubled the vanilla, and added 3 tbls milk. They maintained their chewyness about as well as Toll House (I can make perfect Toll House at sea level so I trust these would work well too). I can't buy here in Peru, but strongly recommend almond AND Coconut extracts if you want their flavor and not just their textures. I love chocolate but if you want this to be different from CC cookies, use fewer CCs.

Loved these!  I toasted the coconut and almonds (also used sliced almonds instead)...delicious.  I took advice from other recipes and added some extra coconut and almond extract. I would absolutely make these again.

this is now my absolute favorite cookie recipe (it often gets requested) because it is so good and also the recipe is one where i can add in different ingredients and subsitute things in and it still tastes fantastic. i love to make monster cookies by using an ice cream scoop - they will take 20 to 25 minutes to bake

I made this cookie, and it was awful, very dry, and the dough wouldn't stick together.  Maybe my flour was too dry, but I don't think i will be making this one again.  SO disappointing!

These cookies are surprisingly easy to make as well as being delicious!... I cut back on the amount of chips.. I subsituted shortening for the margarine and added 1 cup of quick cooking oats... and 1 cup of raisons... for added chewiness and nutrition..People tell me that these are the best chocolate chip cookies they have ever tasted.. and I am inclined ot agree...!

The flavor was not what I expected.  It really was more like a chocolate chip cookie, though decent flavored.  As other reviewers noted, it would be alot of cookies, so I halved the recipe.  I also changed the extract to half vanilla/ half coconut.  I doubled the amount of coconut almost.  However it still did not have more than a very faint coconut flavor at that.  

If I try this recipe again, I would suggest only using coconut extract and to cut back on the chocolate chips so that it won't overwhelm the coconut.

These cookies are great!  I made these when my daughter's friend was sleeping over & she loved them so much that now I make a batch for us and a batch for her.  It's the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use now.

These were so moist and full of flavor. It was a big hit! These cookies don't last. I've made them for my parents and my in laws and they were gone the next day. Great cookie to add for Christmas.

The cookies came out a little dry for my taste (even when I underbaked them).  I tried adding a little oil to the recipe to compensate and it helped a bit.  Also I think 5 cups is far too much chocolate, I could hardly stir 4 cups in!  The recipe was okay but not nearly as good as I'd hoped from reading other reviews.

I thought they were good (although a bit expensive which made these 4 stars, not 5 for me), but I took them to a picnic and they got RAVE reviews!  It was the only dessert to be completely eaten by the end of the picnic.  I used 4 cups choc. chips and I think that was plenty.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I got about 5-1/2 dozen from the batch.  A keeper.

Delicious! Is the coconut supposed to be sweetened or unsweetened? I used unsweetened, toasted, and added about 1/2 cup more white sugar and a few more tbsps coconut oil for it- I used half butter and half coconut oil. Also read some reviews and added two tsps of almond and a few of coconut extract. Used toasted almonds and some peanuts. Subbed a few cups of whole wheat flour and a cup of quick oats for some flour. Great flavor, but 5 is waaaay too many chocolate chips. I added two and a half and they fell out of the dough as I made balls, though not a big problem other than at the end. Very good for our church's fundraiser.

These were great!  I couldn't taste the almonds, so I think next time I will add 1 tsp. almond extract, and then it will be just like an Almond Joy candy bar.  I did cut down on the chocolate chips as others suggested (3 cups instead of 5) - perfect adjustment!  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good recipe! I followed the person before me, who suggested 350 for 8 minutes, which was great. The cookies had a bit of a coating - not sure what it is 'cause I'm not an "expert baker" - but it made the cookie a little shiny? Anyway, I'd definitely make this again.

These need a little modification but are very tasty. Use only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the white sugar that's called for, and about 2/3 the chocolate chips. (The exact amount will depend on how many serving you are trying to make.) They're not especially coconut-y, so if you really like that flavor you could add more coconut or perhaps a little bit of coconut rum. I used salted, roasted almonds and they added a nice flavor and texture.

SUGAR ALERT: I used only 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate, and I put slightly less than the exact amount of sugar.  I still found them to be far too sweet.  However, the moist and chewy texture was really yummy.  When I make these again, I will use 2 cups of bitter-sweet chocolate, halve the sugar, and possibly use unsweetened coconut if I can find it at a different store.  YMMV--I don't like chocolate in the first place.

Wow! These are the best cookies I have ever had.  I made a few changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I followed all the directions exactly except I used one bag of Hershey Baking Kisses and one bag of chocolate chips, 1/2 bag of coconut and about 1/3 of cup of chopped almonds.  I was worried because I didn't have enough of everything, but these cookies are truly delicious. Chewy and sweet.  I made about 30 cookies and froze the rest of the batter for the next time I need a fix.  Hopefully it will keep. :)

I also cut back the chips to 3 cups ( I used carob) & used all whole wheat flour - the result were delicious & healthy cookies.

Every time I bake these cookies, people beg for more.  Even people who swear they don't like coconut eat them up.

these came out so delicious! i added only 2tsp of vanilla extract, but added 2tsp of coconut extract to make up for the lack of vanilla ext. as for the mix-ins, i only added 2.5 cups of choc. chips, 2 cups of coconut, and 1.5 cups of chopped almonds... basically, just eye-balled the amount of mix-ins as i folded it all in.
they came out so soft... the 1.5 cups of both white and brown sugars kinda made me weary b/c, that's a LOT of sugar, but they weren't all that sweet... baking these were a cinch... they stayed chewy, soft and didn't turn flat... definitely a keeper!

This was a very expensive cookie to make considering how tasteless it was, especially for 2 bags of chips at $2.99 a bag, plus almonds plus coconut.  I was sooo disappointed.I've been baking a long time, and I can't figure out what the appeal is supposed to be. Very bland, never again.

I made these cookies twice.  I used a little less chocolate chips then the recipe suggests.  I turned out great each time.  I took them to neighborhood parties so I never had a left over.  They just disappear.

Wonderful Cookies!!!  I have made this recipe several times in my restaurant and they are always a hit.  They do get hard after a few days but that's the only problem I've seen.  I also cut down on the chocolate chips because there are too many per cookie.

These were enJOYEDed (recipe used to be called Almond Joy Cookies)!! Great chocolate chip cookies but to make them superb, you must take the reveiwers' advice: for half the recipe (40+ cookies), I used 3t coconut extract and 1t almond. Next time I will use more. Forget the vanilla! Thanks.

These cookies are delicious! They have become a family favorite, and my sister has actually made them two days in a row before! They are easy to make, and for those of you who love coconut, you might want to add another 1/2 cup. I just finished eating a few... and I might be heading back to the kitchen soon. ;)

This recipe is great.  It makes alot of cookie dough so you need a big bowl.  I like it better with more coconut though.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thank you Brenda.

Very good chocolate chip cookies.  I too used more coconut and added coconut and almond extracts.  The amount of dough was almost too much for my large Kitchen Aid mixer--definitely don't try this recipe with a small mixer.

As recommended in previous reviews, I increased the coconut by 1 cup, decreased the chips to 3 cups, and used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 coconut extract.  They really smelled just like the candy! This recipe makes a TON of cookies.

This recipe is delicious right out of the oven.  Everyone in my house loved them.  Next time I would add more coconut and almonds, the chocolate flavor was a little overpowering.  This recipe makes a LOT of cookies, I made half and then froze the other half for a quick dessert.

Wow! I just made a batch of these cookies and I can't stop eating them! They're wonderful. This recipe, however, makes about 8 dozen average sized cookies, not 4 dozen as it states. I made  half the recipe, using 2 cups of chocolate chips, 1 & 1/2 cups of coconut, and no nuts. I ended up with 4 dozen cookies. The baking time and temperature was just right. In any case, thanks so much for the recipe Brenda!

These are really nothing special, i would suggest adding vanilla extract and a quarter cup of almonds (ground into a fine powder), put more coconut also, they just taste like cookies otherwise

These cookies are very good. I took the advise of a previous reviewer and added only 3 cups of chocolate chips. The taste is very close to that of Almond Joy candy bars.

I was expecting something different when I made these.  I was expecting somewhat of an Almond Joy taste, but all I got was a really fabulous chocolate chip cookie with a coconut and almond texture.  I did give i 4 stars for being one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted.  Just was expecting something different.

This is a very delicious and unique cookie recipe, I am very happy to have found it, as are all of my cookie taster family and friends!  I also only used 3 cups of chocolate chips, found this to be just right.  This recipe makes an enormous amount of good sized cookies, be prepared for a lot of dough when making them.  My Kitchenaid could barely handle the job-I started teasing my hubby that I was going to have to buy the BIG $500 mixer if he wanted these cookies again...they are pretty good though...so maybe I will get blessed with the mother of all mixers!  Sweet fancy Moses!  Anyhow, try these cookies, they are excellent!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

A yummy variation of chocolate chip cookies.  I went with 3c of chips instead of 5 and my Kitchen-Aid could barely handle the load!  Made enough for an army.  Ideal for using leftover Christmas baking supplies.

Wow- who cares if they aren't exactly like an Almond Joy candy bar, they're fabulous!?!  BTW, how big WERE the cookies you made?  I halved the recipe and made 42 very good sized cookies- also had to cook them for 10-13 minutes instead of the 8-10.  Bravo, I think I'm going to have to lock them up so my husband won't eat them all!

I started making these and then realized I had only a cup or so of chocolate chips abs since my husband is a chocoholic, I cut back the flour by 1/4 c and added cocoa powder. He’s munching on them now and loving them. They took every bit of 10 minutes for me at 375

Quick and simple recipe sure to please anyone. Cookies don’t spread out very much so you can get a fair number on a single cookie sheet. I found that my current time was 11 minutes and that seem to work best for caramelized bottom of the cookie and just the right amount of chew.

I made these several times PERFECT! I use salted butter,  like that against the semi sweet chocolate.

Like some others, I cut down on the chips and used 1 1/2 cups semi sweet & 1  1/2 cups salted caramel chips. I used 3 teaspoons  almond extract & 2 vanilla instead of 4 vanilla. I also baked them at 350 for 10 minutes and they came out a tad crispy on the outside edges and moist & chewy inside.  These are sooooooo good and make a large quantity. I am sure they will be a hit at the Holiday party tonight

I affirm the changes others made: Add the same amount of chocolate as nuts/coconut (I added like 1 1/8 C and even felt like that extra eighth made it too sweet). I cooked at 350 as others suggested, but it took 11 minutes. A nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies, and delicious!!

This is a great recipe. After reading others reviews, I halved the recipe, reduced the chocolate chips to 2 cups, used half vanilla and half almond extract. Next time I will reduce the chocolate a little more and up the coconut, but this is a great recipe.

I used my small cookie scoop and this will probably make more than three dozen cookies.

Made a half recipe which made 4 dozen.  Used as some had suggested 1/2 c. less chocolate chips and 1/4 c. more coconut.  They are terrific and I'll make more again.  Passed them out at a potluck, and they loved them too.

Made these for gang at work on a Friday.  Everyone loved them! I did make a couple of tweeks  after reading the other reviews.   I replaced one of the cups of chocolate chips with a cup of butterscotch chips.  Instead of 4 tsp of vanilla I used 3 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract.    As well, I toasted the almonds in the oven before adding them.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

These cookies are delicious, but I only gave it 3 stars cause the recipe is wrong. 5 cups of chips is way too much, when I make it again I will use 3. Use more coconut and change the vanilla to coconut if you want to taste coconut. Also takes longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but really delicious!

This is a great recipe, though I made a couple of changes based purely on preference.  I decreased the chocolate chips to 4 cups and increased the coconut and almonds to 2 1/2 cups each.

These are very good.  And the best thing is how soft they stay.  I live in a dry climate, and baked goods dry out really quick.  But these stayed soft for at least a week.

Don't let the coconut put you off.  My dh doesn't like it, but he still liked the cookies.  

This is much more like a fancy choc. chip cookie than like an Almond Joy candy bar.

This is a wonderful recipe !! The cookies came out really good, the only change I made, following other users sugestions, is that I added more coconut and it was really good! My husband doesn't like cookies/desserts that much and he has been eating the cookies all day long ! I love this recipe!

These are terrific cookies.  I made them and took them into work and got rave reviews.  Even people who aren't cookie fans couldn't get enough of them.  I am going shopping today to buy more ingredients so I can make them tonight.  I only had about 2 1/2 cups of chocolate chips at home, so that's all I added, and the recipe was perfect.  Thanks for sharing a terrific cookie recipe, Brenda!

A very tasty cookie. I made a half recipe. I cut the amount of choc chips also, for a half recipe I added 1 cup milk choc and 1 cup semi-sweet. I also added 1/3 cup cocoa to batter due to reviews stating it was almost like a chocolate chip cookie. I flattened the dough balls before baking. I baked for 7 minutes. Some people commented you could not really taste the coconut so I would probably increase that amount next time. Thanks Brenda!

(I am not the greatest cookie maker)
 These cookies turned out not so good. I'm not sure if maybe i did something wrong, but my cookies tasted like really dry hard oatmeal cookies. They were also very bland. I did not like them and neither did my husband:(

They were really good chocolate chip cookies, but I couldn't taste any almonds or coconut.  I even added more almonds and coconut.

These were good.  I made them as a dessert to a potluck!  I added 1 tablespoon peanut butter for an extra little kick.  I will make again!
