Made this last night.  It was unbelievably delicious!!  Added almost a full garlic (minced) per bag, generous oregano, garlic salt & black pepper & 3-4 shakes of the sauces--on each.  Put the seasonings on everything, not just the chops. Also sliced the onions (added lots) rather than diced. Cut the potatoes in small quarter sizes & put in 2 corn pieces (no more than 2 inches long) .  Baked at 350 for almost 90 minutes--had thick, no bone chops.  IT WAS PERFECT!  No mess, no drips and no clean up. Absolutely fabulous!!!

This was really good!! I love the no clean up! I read the other reviews so I cooked the potatoes in the micro for about 6 minutes first. They came out perfect after baking. I also cooked for 50 minutes, but it really was 5 too long. I used a pork tenderloin instead of chops, and added mushrooms. Everything was flavored wonderfully!! Will make again, Thanks!!

It was very good, however, I doubled the cooking time and the potatoes were still hard. Recommendations: Place the chops directly on the foil, it absorbs the flavoring and browns, delicious. Cook it at a higher temperature, I boosted it up to 375 for the second 45 minutes. Consider substituting the corn (cooks fastest) with something that won't dry out with the longer cooking time (I'm trying beans and potatoes next time). And lastly, CUT THE POTATOES SMALL. After 1.5 hours, the small ones were so tasty and perfect.

Very good!  For everyone upset about the potatoes- Nuke them in the microwave for about 5 minutes while you prepare everything else.  They come out great that way!  I added Mrs. Dash spicy mix and Essence of Emeril on top, and a couple of splashes of Tabasco to suit our tastes.  My two boy roommates wolfed every last bit down!  They want me to make it again! Thanks!!

It was... ok. I did pre-boil the potatoes, which was good. It was a nice country meal, nothing spectacular, a bit bland. Yet if you are in a hurry, you might enjoy this quick meal, preparing only takes about 10 minutes and the oven does the rest. Worth a try, besides, not everybody's tastes are the same.

I made 4 individual packets.  I nuked red potatoes for 6 minutes, used 1 ear of corn broken in half for each packet.  I would probably use more onion next time.  I grilled these over med/high for about 10 minutes each side, chops were nice & moist.  YUMMY!!!  new way to make chops...oh and I didn't use the bread crumbs.

I used different seasonings, frozen corn, and chunks of celery instead of potatoes because most of the reviews said that the cooking time was to short to soften them properly. This couldn't be more true. The celery was still very crunchy, and even my onions were borderline raw. All and all a good idea, but needs more cooking time.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was easy to make, very flavorful, and there was little mess.  I did alter the recipe a bit based on the previous reviews and what was in my kitchen.  I cut the potatoes smaller than recommended in the original recipe and I used three different types of potatoes (red potatoes, white potatoes, and yellow buttery potatoes) to get a range of taste. I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I used lemon juice. I put a tablespoon of each of the following items in each foil packet: soy sauce, lemon juice, and water.  For dry spices I used garlic salt, oregano, lemon pepper, and black pepper.  I also added carrots to the foil packet.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  The one other thing I will probably change in the future is to remove the breadcrumbs.  To me they did not seem to add anything to the recipe.

Very good and very easy. The chops I used were humongous, so I ended up having to cook this about twice what the recipe calls for, but they came out juicy and yummy. I added corn and carrots, both came out fine, but it did cook for 1.5 hours, rather than 45 mins, so if I was using smaller chops I'd probably cut them into tinier pieces.  Next time I will try with mushrooms and other veggies. Thanks!

This recipe would have been perfect had the vegtables cooked!!  By the time the chops were done to perfection (and they were delicious), the veggies were still practically raw.  Sorry to say, this is not a keeper for me.

I made this last night and it was a hit with my husband. I cooked it a little longer because I had thick pork chops. Next time I will cut up the potatoes a little smaller because they weren't quite done. Will definitely make this again!
Thanks!

Tasted like pot roast with the seasoning combination I chose but tasty enough. (I used oregano, pepper and sea salt).

This was absolutely delicious!! Instead of corn I used frozen green beans, and I cooked the potatoes first. I forgot to add the water, but it still came out fantastic! I also added my own spices, such as a little cayenne pepper, oregano, basil, paprika and thyme. It came out awesome, this recipe is great!

This is a great starter recipe..but, quartering and just baking my tatoes for 45 min just wasn't enough to make this tender enough to stick a fork in..i wound up microwaving the potatoes after baking for a few minutes to make them manageable..maybe microwaving a few min beforehand would help?  anyhow..my only complaint.  My addition of seasoning was Emeril's Bayou Blast..love the kick!

very good recipe.  I added lots of garlic and other seasonings.  I cut the potatoes in bite size pieces.  They were still a bit hard, so i would suggest cutting them very small.  Other than that, it was delicious.

I did modify this recipe a little.  I omitted the corn, but added some chopped celery, mushrooms, and instead of bread crumbs used leftover cornbread.

The flavor and juiciness of the pork was great!  However, like many others, the potatoes were not completely done.  I microwaved the chopped potatoes first, and cooked the entire thing for a little over an hour at 350.  So take that into account when preparing this dish.

I will try it again, as everything else was very good.

Absolutely excellent. Gave it only 4 stars due to the changes I made. I omitted the ear of corn and dried bread crumbs. I peeled and quartered 6 red potatoes and 4 large carrots. I placed everything including the chops into one bowl then covered with the liquid. I added extra italian seasonings. After mixing well, I  placed it all in a foil bag and cooked for an hour. It could not have been moister or tastier. Only change I might make would be to mix it all ahead of time and let it marinate for a bit first.

I really liked this recipe.  The sauce was really yummy - I'm glad I minced the onions (along with the garlic), instead of just chopping them because it really made the sauce heavenly.  My potatoes were like the other reviewers' in that they weren't cooked thoroughly when the chops were done, but they were definitely edible and the dish was still delicious!
I actually cooked my packets in my pressure cooker b/c i was short on time -- I put 2 cups of water in the cooker, put the packets on top of the rack, and voila! entire meal in less than 15 minutes.  I will make this again, next time using the oven method and letting it cook longer so the potatoes will be tender.  Thanks Paula!

This is a great camping recipe!  I took along all of the ingredients in a cooler and prepared the foil packets right at the camp site.  I placed the packets in a cast iron dutch oven and set it directly over the fire.  I guessed at the cooking time which turned out to be about 1 hour 15 minutes.  I'd have probably taken it off sooner, but I had a fish on my line!  After I'd landed the trout, we had this meal and it was great! P.S. We had the trout for breakfast the next morning! :-)

This is really good.  I made it pretty much as written, just skipped the corn.  Will make again because it's super easy.  
Like others, I did pre-cook the potatoes just slightly before throwing them in with the pork chops.  My pork chops were small and the 45 minute time frame was enough with the potatoes pre-cooked.
Because my family tends to be big eaters I made an extra packet of potatoes seasoned the same as the ones with the pork.  It worked well!

The first time I made this, after reading some of the reviews about the potatoes not being done, I used canned and it turned out pretty good.  The pork was very tender and almost melted in your mouth and got huge compliments from my dad who doesn't like anything (haha, sad, but true!).  I don't make it with the vegetables or garlic anymore, but added honey to the soy sauce/Worcestershire mix and every time I've made pork shops they have been awesome and so easy to eat.  Its so good we have it at least once a week!

I gave it 3 out of 5 because I altered it a lot. I added one med. bell pepper, 1 small yellow pepper, 1 small red pepper, cajun seasoning, I doubled the garlic and used can corn. Cooked for 1 hour at 375. YUMMY!!!!

I wish I had read the reviews first like I usually do.  The potatos were still hard after an hour in the oven and I cut them small.  I liked the easy clean up but won't make these again.

I used "loose" frozen corn and a lot more garlic, as I omitted the onion.  Like others before me, I'll say the potatoes didn't cook thoroughly.  I also didn't see the point of the bread crumbs - it just made it look lumpy and didn't add much to the taste.

If I make it again, I'll probably just do pork chops with mushrooms, and then do rice on the side.  

I did like the taste of the chops themselves.

Very easy.  Some flavor, not a ton.  My husband LOVED it.  And I, of course, used more garlic than was called for!  Also added butter to keep everything nice and moist.  A nice, easy summer dish.

I'm giving this four stars instead of 5 only because the potatoes did take longer to cook than suggested.  Next time I make these, I will par boil them first, and that will make all the difference in the world.  That being said, my family really enjoyed this!  My kids loved the name, and were instantly willing to try it (no small feet in my house)  Only my 2 yr old picked at it a bit, but he did eat most of it.  I will definately make these again, and the flavor was really good.

The flavor was good but not excellent. I took the advice of others' and and cut the potatoes small - and they still weren't cooked! It was edible but nothing special... cute name though.

This recipe sounded great for my family of six.  I followed the directions to a "T".  The potatoes were not cooked when the time was up, and it really didn't taste good.  Sorry!  Everybody has their own tastes!

This was a very bland dish.  I followed the directions to a T and with no luck.  The potatoes had a totally different taste than the pork chops... I thought that was odd.  We were able to muster down the meal, but unfortunately won't be making this dish again.  I loved the idea of baking everything together in the foil.  Shucks.

We altered this a little because we did not have corn, but it turned out GREAT!  Because each pouch is fixed separately, we could adjust the amount of ingredients to suit each family member!  Everyone in the family loved it and requested again soon!

We ended up throwing this out.  The potatoes didn't get done at all even though I chopped them up according to instructions, and the flavor of the meat was just so-so.  Unfortunately, this turned into a frozen pizza night.  - Allison

This was absolutely *delicious*!!! My nine year old is now convinced that he ate kangaroo, and is so proud that he liked it. This recipe was so very simple to put together, and once put together, you could forget about it for nearly an hour, which was wonderful. I just put all the seasonings right on top and everything filtered down. My family loved it and I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This recipe tasted kind of bland to me. I loved the idea of cooking everything together like that but the vegetables would never get done. I cooked it for longer than the recipe called for and the vegetables were still a little hard. I could have been using too much foil. I had a hard time getting everything to fit without leaking out.

Delicious food for dinner for two.  I think kids would find this too "weird looking" with the wilted veggies.  I used my own sweet corn I froze from last harvest and it turned out super yummy
