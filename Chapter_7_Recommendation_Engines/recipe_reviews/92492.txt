The batter was way too thick. I thought it would become softer when I added the spinach and feta cheese like when you make  a carrot cake but it didn't. After they were cooked, the muffins were very chewy. I will never make these again.

I thought these were pretty good. The batter was dry but increasing the milk produced a nice moist muffin.
