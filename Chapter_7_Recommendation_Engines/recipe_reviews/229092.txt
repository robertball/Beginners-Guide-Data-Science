This is one of those "lost" recipes on AllRecipes. I'm surprised there are no other reviews, as it's great.  I served this for a luncheon and everyone cleaned their plates.  I found that it only took 30 minutes to bake, although I used a stoneware pan and my oven runs a tad hot. Although I otherwise followed the recipe exactly, I don't think you need a blender to mix the eggs/cream and nutmeg.  A brisk whisk would work just as well, I'd thing. In any case, try it!

Turns out the jar I thought was sun dried tomatoes was in fact sun dried tomato pesto...what a fortuitous mistake!  The flavors blended well with the asparagus.  This is a quiche in the traditional French style, no cheese just the custard.  I think the temperature/timing are a bit off.  I reduced the temperature back to 375 after it had been baking for 15 minutes and it still was a bit browner than I would prefer so I think next time I will reduce the baking time too.  But there will be a next time.  Thank you, Steve!

I didn't use chili sauce but pepper flakes. Even so the burn from the peppers out weighed the delicate taste of the asparagus. The next  time I make it , I'll use a small amount of hot sauce so I can control the heat.  Otherwise, what a pleasing dish.

I had been itching to try making a quiche lately, and this one was definitely decent.  I _did_ take another reviewer's suggestion and whisked the egg mixture rather than waste time putting it in a blender.  Also combined the egg mixture and sauteed veggies in one bowl before pouring everything into the crust.  Just a few things to watch out for ... my filling was definitely too much for the crust.  All I can think is that "one bunch" of asparagus could differ from chef to chef.  Maybe I had too many veggies?  It definitely overfilled the crust, though.  Also, I think the bake time is a little high.  Or my oven just runs hot.  But I baked it 5 minutes less than the recipe called for, and it was still awfully dark.  Next time I make this, I might try adding some cheese, as I think that was the one ingredient that could have improved the recipe, but overall, a very good recipe!  Will definitely make it again with a few minor adjustments.

This was just okay.  I have been craving quiche lately and made 3 in the last week.  This was the most expensive to make and my least favorite.  The sun dried tomatoes really overpower the taste of the entire quiche.  There is no cheese in this recipe and I think it needs some - goat cheese or feta would fit well with the flavors.  Also, the cook time on this quiche was quite long compared to others.  The first time I have had to cook the crust first.  I won't be making this again.
