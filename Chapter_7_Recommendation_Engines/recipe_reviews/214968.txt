The ginger in this recipe makes it irresistible.  I know it says to serve 10 minutes after it is prepared.  This seems to be important.  I prepared it about 1 1/2 hours before I served it.   In that time the water had drained from the cucumbers and there was too much sauce, and the sauce was too watery.  It was better when I tasted it right after I had prepared it.  Excellent mix of flavors.

Did not have tamarind juice so googled substitute which is 1/4 cup OJ + 2 tbs of lime juice.  I like my Thai cucumber salad a little sweeter, so added 1 packet of Splenda. with added sweetner rate 5 stars

This was fabulous.  I accidentally put one and a half tablespoons of brown sugar, so then I just basically doubled/tripled the other ingredients to make up for it.  I also ate this immediately, but next time I will salt the cucumbers for an hour or so before mixing with the sauce, so I can refrigerate any leftovers without the cucumbers getting soggy.

This salad blows my mind.  I do like to salt the cucumbers for about an hour beforehand - pour a bunch of salt on your pile of sliced cukes sitting in a colander over a bowl or sink.  (Like...a bunch of salt.  You're rinsing it off anyway, so don't be shy.) Let them chill out for an hour, then rinse all that salt off and dry with a paper towel  before moving on.  Keeps things from getting watery once it sits for a bit.  And you don't want to water down that dressing - really, I could just make that and skip the cukes, and eat it with a spoon instead.  Anyway, I don't always have tamarind around, so will substitute lime juice in a pinch.  (Although tamarind is delicious - it's what gives Worcestershire sauce that little extra sumpin' sumpin'.)  Scallions don't hurt either, but you can survive without them.  The sesame oil is non-negotiable though - it doesn't seem like much, but trust me, you want it in there.

This was good.  I omitted the red pepper flakes and added two finely diced Thai chillies because I had them on hand.  Lots of HEAT!  But very good.

Excellent!  This reminds me of a cucumber salad I used to order at a sushi joint near my old house, only with a lot more zing to it!

Delicious and authentic.  I served it for a group of 8 tonight and it was the first dish to finish.  The subtle fish sauce adds so much dimension to the marinade.  I will make again.

I had a chopped chicken thai salad at a local chain restaraunt that was fab! I wanted to duplicate it, so I created my own and used the dressing from this recipe. I chopped up a whole head of Napa cabbage, added chopped cucumbers, chopped fresh mint, juilianned carrots and red peppers and shredded chicken breast. It tasted JUST like the salad at the restaurant, only WAY spicier! I would have given this 5 stars, but thought the heat in this was way too much. I will used this recipe again, but turn down the heat by half. I didn't have tamarind, so I googled a substitute and used fresh lime juice instead. The flavor was wonderful!

Great easy and fresh side dish!  Very enjoyable.  Easy to spice up if you like a little more heat.

So I'm new to cooking and I've been wanting people to really like something I make so they will ask for it.  Seriously, I can make 2-3 batches of this a week.  It's been fun to make as my dish to pass as well and I'm never able to bring any back home.  One time I only had a single cucumber, so I added a small white onion and red cabbage.  I've also skipped the red pepper flakes and used a half jalape√±o or Thai chillie--not everyone likes it hot over here.  I add unsalted, chopped peanuts sometimes too.  Num!

The sauce was overpowering and a bit on the tart side. It could have benefited from at least twice the brown sugar and perhaps a little (TBS or two) of water. As a side note: salting the cucumbers does work to get them to release the juices but depending on how much you put on, it can leave a lingering salty taste. Great for normal cucumbers but is offputting when combined with this sauce. I think it would be better to leave the juices and eat the dish quickly. I had some cold cooked chicken which I added.  of it.

Wonderful recipe with a great blend of Thai flavors. The whole family loved it. I used a fresh chili, minced, instead of the pepper flakes. I added a more peanuts and cilantro, because I love those flavors. Next time I might add some sliced green onions. Yum!
