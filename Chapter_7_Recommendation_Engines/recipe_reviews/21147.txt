* Really excellent!
* Make a double batch. Your friends will take it home with them!
* Also try the exact same recipe - but add a head of so of roasted garlic - and float a few cloves, as well. It really mellows the flavour.

A good and easy recipe.  however, I think the distilled vinegar made it a bit too sharp.  I am going to play with the ingrediences a bid...use a different vinegar and try roasted garlic as well.

I've never rated a recipe on here before, but I made a batch of this astounding jelly yesterday and am getting ready to make another one today to give as gifts. Since I LOVE garlic, I may try adding some more garlic cloves to what I make today and use yesterday's for gifts. I also want to try the roasted garlic mentioned by another user. Absolutely excellent recipe.

I love garlic, and thought this would be interesting to try; unfortuantely it wasn't all I had hoped.  Could be personal taste, but I found the garlic/sugar/vinegar mixture ended up tasting just like it sounds, and the flavours didn't blend nicely.
I now have 12 jars of garlic jelly, and don't know what to do with it...

I made this recipe and gave it out to a few friends. Those who love garlic will love this. I have used it on pork and baked chicken. Next time, I will use roasted garlic.

I had planned to give this as Christmas gifts. I love garlic and thought this would be delicious. It didn't live up to my expectations and I ended up making jalapeno jelly instead.

EXCELLENT! my husband cannot get enough of this and has been giving it to friends to try.  it is wonderful and he likes to mix a half pint with half a stick of butter and heat in microwave till liquid.  then either add pizza toppings (sounds weird but very good) and put on texas toast or put straight on t.t. and sprinkle with garlic powder.  so good, haven't made it to meat marinade yet.  may try to mellow it only a tad. love it!!!

Excellent recipe!  Very good with crackers.  I haven't tried it on any meat yet.  The only change I would make would be to add more garlic.

This is amazing with crackers and cream cheese... I added about 1/2 cup chopped garlic to add texture and just after adding the pectin I added whole jalapeno peppers one for each jar made. I hope it has a bit of heat when I open for the next cocktail party!

Different, but good.  Smells like garlic & vinegar a lot.  Haven't tasted it yet, but I'm sure it will be a great marinade.

What a unique recipe!  We love garlic, so like the other reviews suggested, I added more garlic.  Also I made a batch using roasted garlic and substituted some of the vinegar with basamic vinegar.  Yum.  Very easy recipe to work with.

If you are a jelly maker this is a great receipe. The only change I made was to put 2/3 of a cup in cloves in food processor and it made a 1/2 cup of puree.  I do craft fairs and this will be my new jelly of the season.  The 1/2 cup puree cuts the vinegar and gives it the garlic taste you want with a little sweet.

Not what I was expecting. I doubled the amount of garlic and still didn't get as much garlic as I thought would be there. Vinegar is a bit overpowering.

Mine came out horrible!  I was so excited about making this recipe.  About 1 minute after adding the pectin, the mixture turned green!  I mean green as the grass green.  I followed the rest of the recipe thinking that maybe cooking the mixture would remove the color.  I don't know how it tastes.  It may just taste wonderful, but I haven't been brave enough to try it (the color is really a turn off).  The other reviews seem so good, I maybe just goofed (although the recipe seems pretty goof proof).

Very decent recipe. I made three batches and for the first used the exact recipe. I made the second with the roasted garlic modification and it is definitely the better jelly. With the third batch(because I was out of white vinegar) I used apple cider vinegar and also added roasted garlic, parsley,and rosemary to the garlic which upped the garlic mix to 1/2 a cup rather then a 1/4 cup. The third version is going to be an excellent pork rub for sure! I did not have any problems with set at all but one jar didn't want to seal so I put it in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and then let it stand. It sealed. I can see that this might not be everyone's cup of tea but it works for me! Thanks

I love Garlic!! This jelly is good on fresh bread and baked chicken and chicken strips as a dipping sauce.(great on everything!) I could not find any liquid pectin so I used powder. It came out good but you might need to warm it up after it had been in the fridge. I need to make more my friends are almost out.

The little bit left from my canning was so tasty!  I actually got 6 half pints out of this but I may have had more garlic.  We were gifted with 9 bulbs of elephant garlic. (HUGE)  but it is a milder garlic. so i used an entire bulb which chopped down to more like 2/3 cup.  I also added a bit of salt to the mix, because after tasting just the vinegar and sugar and garlic, it needed something.  might be because of the mild garlic, but,  it sure turned out good.  the little i had left that couldn't be jarred is going to be spread on a mishmosh cuban sandwich.  thank you for the inspiration!

I had my doubts about garlic, but my daughter really wanted to make it.  We entered it into our local fair and we both won ribbons!  This is going to be a really unique gift for family and friends.
