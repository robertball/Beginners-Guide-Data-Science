This pie is absolutely amazing! Although I made some modifications. I used quince with apples and I had more apples thah quince. I seemed 1/2 cup honey and 3/4 cup in the sauce would be very sweet, so I used only 1/4 cup brown sugar in the sauce and it was enough.  When I added the sugar mixture to the reserved quince liquid the sauce became too thick, so I needed to add more water. I`m sure this pie will be amazing not only with quince, but with apples or pears.

Really very nice but time consuming. I only had three quinces so I cooked those up and then while they were cooking, topped them up with apple. I only used about a third of a cup of demera sugar in the sauce because the recipe looked a bit sweet and it was beautiful. Worth the time it took to make! Next time I plan to make 2 and freeze one to save time. Would thoroughly recommend!!!

This very nice pie is brimming with fruit.  As the recipe description states the quince has a floral essence that reminds me of rose water.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delicious! I hadn't even heard of quince until a few days ago. I doubled the recipe and actually had enough sauce for 2 deep dish pies. I used Pillsbury pie crust and rubbed melted butter onto the top of the pie and generously sprinkled white sugar on it as well. The bake time was less for me, was ready about halfway through the 45 minute time. I highly recommend this recipe! Sweet/tart yumminess!

I did the recipe just as instructed but found it was too sweet for my taste so next time I'll cut the sugar by half. I'd like to try brown sugar instead of white too. The amount of liquid was fine, but if reducing the sugar it would be best to add a bit more water when the quince are cooking. Great pie! we all loved it!

It's a good recipe, what I would do the next time is put half of the filling on the crust, then de cooked quince and then the other half of the filling. This to combine the flavor much better.

A delicious pie that was very easy to make. I had 4 large quinces given to me from a friend's farm and decided to use them on this recipe. The 4 peeled and sliced quinces probably only made up 2 pounds word but it was plenty for a shallow dish. I also used an organic honey that was pretty intense flavor-wise, so next time I'll probably use a little less or go for a honey with a more mellow fragrance... Gobbled.

WAY too much honey. I didn't even use a 1/2 cup because it seemed a bit much, and it still came out tasting more like a honey pie. Vanilla ice cream helped temper it, and otherwise was good. You may only need 1 or 2 tbsp tops.

We have a quince tree in the backyard.  I made this pie exactly as the recipe stated.  It was wonderful.  I took it to a church dinner and everyone raved about it.

We changed ours quite a bit. We added apples, pears and blackberries, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was wonderful and was gone in an instant. 
We did follow the advice in the recipe and used a homemade crust (always the best!)
Thank you for this recipe.

while this recipe was indeed just as time consuming as it says it is, it's totally worth it if you have quince to use up and want to impress people with your mad pie skills. I followed the recipe exactly because I'd never cooked quince before, plus I was using a Japanese quince I'd found on sale near me (I'm in Japan) and didn't know how bitter it would be (it was inedible raw). I only had a 7in cheesecake pan, but it all fit perfectly!! I used Chef John's pie crust recipe which held up beautifully to the density of the filling (side note: that crust recipe gave me a 9in-wide, 1/8in thick top and bottom plus extra that could be rolled out a little thinner for another 9in crust later on). I also followed a tip in the comments to layer the sauce and fruit in multiple layers instead of just doing fruit and then sauce. I would DEFINITELY do that again because it helped the sauce permeate the whole pie instead of sitting on top and/or soaking the top.

I used 1 C white sugar instead of 1/2. I also used a whole wheat crust (1-1/2 C white flour plus 1/2 C whole wheat flour)

Really delicious. Next time I will add half as much sugar and honey. This much honey overpowers the quince, and the level of sweetness should definitely be brought down several notches.

I found this pie extremely tart. In fact, my husband and father in law, who both eat quince raw, had a hard time eating this pie when made according to the recipe. I will attempt to make it again but will do so with some major modifications - adding sugar and spices to the liquid used to cook the quince and cooking them for a bit longer to make them sweeter prior to baking the pie.
