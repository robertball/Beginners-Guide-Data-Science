I love sweet potatoes and I love biscuits so what better combination. Made them twice and they were a hit. This will be my new staple.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've ever had even my brother and sister who absolutely hate sweet potatoes devoured these biscuits. These biscuits were gone in a matter of minutes.

The texture was too dense for me so I'm sure I over mixed the dough. Also the dough tasted a little bland. Before baking I sprinkled some cinnamon to half the biscuits then sprinkled the brown sugar. I definitely like the added spice better.

forgot the sour cream but added a heaping two tablespoons of pumpkin butter and I changed the crisco to regular salted butter. I only sprinkled the top with a touch of brown sugar for fear it would burn fast in a 400 degree oven. These are great with butter as a nice touch with hot tea...but would also hold up well for a pile of pulled pork and a bit of cole slaw in them for a real meal!
