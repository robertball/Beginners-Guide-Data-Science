I did a med review because I haven't made it and nobody has posted a review. I will make this because it sounds amazing and I'll get back to you.

Rather than plain flour I used Bisquick and added thyme and 1/2 cup of corn to the recipe. I dropped the batter by rounded tablespoons into smallish oval shapes for easy dipping; and served them with Ranch and Blue Cheese dressings. The recipe was excellent. I'm planning to make them again...on Superbowl Sunday.
