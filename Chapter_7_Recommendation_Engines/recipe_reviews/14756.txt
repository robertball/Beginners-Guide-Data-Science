This recipe was great. Sweet, but not artificial tasting. Unfortunately, the recipe omits what kind of liquid to "bring to a boil". Pretty sure it's not the 4T of soy sauce. I just used a couple cups of water and it was fine. I also wished they described the consistency of the honey sauce to know when it is done. I tried to reduce it some and let it simmer only about 5 minutes.

I give this 4 stars as written, but it definitely is 5 stars with my revisions! First thing, I boiled the ribs w/ an extra 1/2c water and I added about 1/4c of that liquid from boiling the ribs and added it to the sauce; it gave it good extra flavor. Also, definitely double the sauce! The sauce has wonderful flavor and if you made it as written, it's not enough to cover the ribs fully.  Secondly, I used fennel instead of the star anise because that's what I had and it does make for a good substitute.  Thirdly, I used only 1/4c honey and I think if I used the full 1/2c it would have come out way too sweet.  The ribs itself also came out very tender and juicy! I think I will always cook my ribs this way regardless of what sauce I use on them!

The glaze flavor is excellent, my favorite part of the recipe! I didn't think the recipe was time consuming (you do have to plan ahead) and it certainly was not labor intensive.  Recently, I have started using my slow cooker, instead of a stock pot, to cook the ribs before the final baking.

I am filipino and I like it sweet. Here are my changes. 

1 - I buy baby back ribs or back ribs. The ones that are smaller. I usually do about 3 pounds. If you want leftovers, I would do more. I also use a big stock pot for this.
2 - I use sweet onions. 
3 - I also use sweet soy sauce. I usually use like half a cup of the sauce in the pot mixture and when I make the glaze I also use another half cup of sweet soy sauce.
4 - It doesn't tell you to add liquid to boil the ribs in. I usually add enough beef stock to cover the the ribs along with all the ingredients that it tells you to put into the pot. When the ribs meat start to flake when you put a fork in it then you are done.
5- I use white pepper instead of black pepper. I find that it isn't so strong. 
6 - I find that the glaze is too little so I usually double it because after I take it out of the pot and put it on the cookie sheet which I wrap in foil. (Make it easier on yourself so that when you are done cooking you can just pull up the foil and toss it out). I baste the ribs good and cover with foil. In the last 10-15 mins of cooking, I take the foil off and baste it again. 
7 - Also when making the sauce, taste it. If it's too sweet cut back on the soy sauce. Also you can add some rice vinegar to ease off some of the sweetness. I usually make the sauce in the last 20 mins before the meat is done.

These were great!!  Time consuming but not difficult; I cooked them for my boyfriend and me, and used three lbs. of ribs instead of six.  But I didn't cut any of the other ingredients in half, so the ribs could still have liquid to simmer in, and lots of sauce.  Next time I will just decrease the star anise.  These would be great to take to a party, cut into smaller slabs.  A nice change from regular bbq ribs!  Thanks Christine!!

These were delicious- fall-off-the-bone tender and full of flavor. I was afraid the flavor of the anise pods would be overpowering, (my whole house smelled of the spice after the boiling step), but the sauce works well with the anise flavor. I doubled the amount of sauce and added more as they cooked in the oven. I found that the sauce that dripped from the ribs burned very quickly on the bottom of the baking dish and couldn't be used to spoon over as suggested.

These are delectable and fall right off the bone!  The hint of anise adds an unexpectedly delicious flavor to these ribs.  I made these for my Filipino husband and his brother and am waiting to see if they recognize any flavors; either way, they'll be a hit.  Awesome recipe!!

My favorite rib recipe! I follow the instructions and you don't need to add any liquid to the pot. The meat releases its own liquid during the cooking time.

I love this recipe, it reminded me of  Polynisian ribs.  I put a little dry sherry and some of the fresh ginger in the soy sauce while it was braising.  Family loved the honey lemon glaze.

De-lish! Were'nt sure what liquid to "bring to a boil", so we used a couple cups of beef broth. The sauce was fantastic. Would be great with rice. No problem finding the ingredients at our local chinese grocery. Will make again.

I didn't have any star anise so I crushed some anise seed instead. This recipe is wonderful but I would make extra glaze.

Thanks Christine for a wonderful Asian ribs recipe. I must admit that finding all the ingredients required for it was not an easy task...as far a the quantity of meat, well it
was a little bit too much for our family. The
solution was to scale the recipe down to 8.
It was a time consuming and labor intensive project...but it is well worth it for a special
celebration. Your ribs can be the star of any feast. Salamat!

Instead of boiling ribs, I wrapped them in aluminum foil with the onions, soy sauce, pepper and star anise (I used 2 not 6).  I baked them in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.  I removed them from the foil, increased the oven to 400 degrees laid the ribs in the baking sheet and basted them as directed.  I have been using this method for all my ribs for a long time and they are always fall-off-bone tender and very flavorful

Made these tonight for dinner. I used boneless pork ribs. It turned out pretty good although the reason for my 2 stars is because you don't need so many star anise pods. It almost makes the meat too licorice tasting. The sauce is super duper sweet too. All in all its an okay recipe but I probably won't make them again.

Thanks so much for this recipe, my husdband hates the flavor of BBQ sauce, and this was a great alternitive! I served these as a strarer at a BBQ, BIG HIT, I boiled the ribs the night before,and baked them in the morning. I used lime juice instead of lemon, and soy sauce instead of worcestershire, because that is what I had, I also slightly reduced the star anise, next time I will use mor ginger and more lime juice! SO GOOD

Ok, Just a few things.  I only had 3 lbs of Ribs on hand, and what exactly is suppose to boil?  the four Tbsp of Soy sauce is not enough to boil.  So i added Two cans of Beef Broth and that was such a perfect fit.  Secondly, I didn't have onion on hand so i added Onion Powder to the pot and also added Garlic Powder, Adobo Seasoning, Salt, Pepper, and a touch of Vinegar.  I did make the basting part exactly as told and it was just such a small amount there was no drippings to work with, and remember i only used 3 lbs of ribs.  The Ribs were Good, but my husband and i both agree that maybe a tad too sweet.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  Our guests always finish it - I never have any leftovers!  It is more flavourful than your typical sweet & sour type of rib recipe.  I always make a little extra sauce & freeze for next time.
Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a favourite!

This recipe is packed with flavor and was a huge hit with the family. I did add enough water to cover the ribs when boiled in stock pot. I also added a tbs of Chinese garlic chile sauce to the honey mixture in the pan. Will definitely make these again.

Boiling ribs is the worst way to prepare meat; all the flavor is leached. . A better way would be to braise in the oven

I followed the advice of several reviews - used 3.5 lbs ribs but did not reduce the other ingredients. I used 1/2 cup water, 6  tablespoons soy sauce and 4 1/2 pods of star anis to boil the ribs in a slow cooker for 6 hours. I added 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes to the sauce. The heat from the pepper flakes definitely makes a difference. The sauce turned out to be sweet and tangy with a kick.

Excellent taste and very easy to make.  I did use my slow cooker and cooked the ribs for roughly 8 hours on low.  Had to add an additional 1 cup liquid (you can use either water or broth).  Absolutely agree with other raters that you have to at least triple the sauce for basting.  The only changes I made were to cut back on the Honey & Brown Sugar after reading some of the reviews - didn't want it to be too sweet.  Got Rave reviews from my dinner guest - Two Thumbs Up!

My husband and I really enjoyed these ribs, very flavorful.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because the recipe as is turned out really really sweet.  When I make it again I would cut down both the honey and brown sugar.

I have made this recipe several times now, and like the descriptions says, I NEVER have left-overs!! I normally substitute the star anise for a little allspice, but other than that I pretty much follow the instructions to a T and it always turns out fantastic!! :)

I thought it was okay. It was a little plain for my taste. I disliked the fatty little pieces of meat, wished it was leaner. I would have doubled or quadrupled the ingredients for the sauce so I could cover up the plainess of the meat.

WOW!!!  Every last member of my family came back for seconds on this wonderful dish!!  My kids are not big meat eaters (not for lack of trying on my part) and they gobbled these down like candy.  I double the glaze as recommended on a previous review, but other than that, I followed the directions to the letter.  I can't wait to serve these for family and friends, they were an instant favorite for my family.

I'm Filipino and I did not like it.  I found that it was too dry and the sauce was too sweet...there wasn't enough tang to balance the sweetness.   

I would definitely use the recommendation from another Filipino and add rice vinegar and cook this is a slow cooker.

These ribs were fabulous!  Made with 3 pounds of ribs and did everything else as written.  I did incorporate a few suggestions though.  Added 1/2 c. water to braising pot.  Added 1/4 c. braising liquid to  sauce.  Added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes to sauce.  Everything was so easy and delicious.  Had just the right amount of sauce--only 1 Tbs. left when they were done.  While I was waiting for the oven to preheat, I just set the ribs, meat side down, in the pan of sauce and let them soak (I also basted several times) while the oven heated.   Then, basted every 8 minutes for a total of 32 minutes cooking time in the oven.  Beautiful mahogany color, tender yet still with a little chew.  For us, this was dinner for two; it was a half a slab each and we thoroughly enjoyed.  Three pounds probably amounts to 4 regular servings.  I'll be sharing this recipe with lots of family and friends.  They're gonna love it!  Oh, yeah.  I saved the braising liquid and onions and I think I'll make a pot of rice with it.  We'll see.  Too good to toss.  Don't forget to line your pan with foil--you'll be sorry if you don't.

I did like them but I would use only 2 star anise for the flavor to me was overly powerful.  I can see that the next I will like them a lot better though!  Will make them again with less star anise and know the family would like them.

Usually I read reviews first, but didn't this time- slight mistake. I cut the recipe in half and followed it exactly, inculuding NOT adding extra liquid (broth or water) when boiling the ribs. They still came out moist and tasty.  It's time consuming, but easy. The ribs are way too sweet for me, but flavorful and delicious otherwise.

We made these a week prior to serving them for company, just to be sure we liked them enough to repeat.  We didn't.  The sauce was pretty good but the meat itself was dry and tough.    This just isn't the recipe for us.  Sorry

The anise flavor was way too powerful. Will try again but cut the anise in half. I have a similar recipe that uses 1 tbl pickling spice and BBQ sauce. A family favorite.

Okay, so I just used the sauce on some country style ribs slow cooked on a charcoal grill (seasoned with pepper, garlic, and onion) and that sauce is amazing.  I'll probably try following the recipe and boiling/baking some spareribs at some point too.

We loved it. I added 1/2 cup of vegetable broth to cooking mixture, and braised instead of boiled the ribs in a Dutch oven. Added liquid from cooking to BBQ sauce, along with a pinch more ginger and garlic.

Easy and delicious. I was worried there wouldn't be enough liquid to simmer the ribs so I added about a cup of water. I found however that the ribs and the onions made plenty of water. I actually had to simmer them longer than necessary uncovered to cook down the extra liquid. My husband who loves Asian food loved these.

The ribs dried with cooking over one hour.  I think it needs garlic and more salt.  That may make it inauthentic, but it would taste better.  Probably won't make again.

4 stars because I just prefer BBQ sauce. The ribs were different and good, though.  Went well with Bush's beans and corn.

Used beef ribs and put in some crushed red pepper for a kick into the sauce. Pre-cooked (in a pressure cooker) in beef broth and onions with the spices called for and made the broth left over into an onion soup.

I made a few variations to this recipe.  The first being I used beef ribs so my husband could partake.  I also seasoned like I would normally season my meat prior to cooking. Sazon, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, etc.  Finally, I finished with another packet of Sazon prior to my last baste.  I think it added flavor. This was a hit with them all!! My daughter even told me (as I was taking her way to school the next morn)she had a dream...it was her eating all the ribs. LOL

Made the recipe as is - I used a rack of lean pork loin ribs. So they were perfect for the oven. Doubled the sauce because we like a lot of sauce and they were great! Maybe next time I'll add some Siracha to heat them up.

I struggle with ribs. Cooking. Method, tenderness, flavour

Having read reviews I made a number of changes

I did precook the ribs as directed. No additional liquid. The flavours were great. 1 1/2 h was enough for tender to fork

The sauce I made a number of changes. I doubled the amount of sauce to begin with. I started w 3 c of onions and cooked in butter with a lid on a large sauce pan for 25 minutes, in the manner of Indian precooking. This reduced the onions almost to a paste. Then I added the remaining ingredients but halved the honey, increased the lemon juice, added 1 tsp of chilli flakes, and I tsp of cumin to layer the flavours. 

I drained the ribs, and cooked over medium low barbecue for 20 min to char and basted w the glaze severAl times. 

Turned out really well. Will make again

Final note - kept and defatted the juices after the precooking. - will make great stock

This was an awesome change to regular  BBQ....even my secret recipe.  I read quite a few reviews.  I only cooked 1/2 a rack of baby backs.  I just used 1 med onion wedged.  I used a little Anise Extract a neighhbor had.  I also added some tarragon (1/4tsp) with 1/2 tsp Balsamic vinegar to pull some of the flavor out(premixed).  I also added 1 cup beef bullion to cook the ribs.

I followed the recipe as written except I used 1/4 cup Honey. Some reviews recommended this.  I prepped the glaze and then when the ribs were done I added about 1/2 cup of the juice to the glaze and reheated.  It was also super eating it by the spoonful!!   This a keeper recipe!!

Of course you will use water!  I have not made this yet but I will soon.  I ALWAYS prep my ribs by letting them simmer the night before.  Bring to a boil, then simmer.  I never did that long though.  But they are always tender whether I cook them on the gril or in the oven.

Delicious and easy to make. I made some modifications to the recipe, like added sriracha for a little heat. Turned out great!

Depending on how much you like star anise flavor (licorise) use either 4 or none & add garlic instead!  -  Used directions as per a previous reviewer.  1st, I boiled the ribs w/ an extra 1/2 cup water & added about 1/4 cup of that liquid from boiling the ribs & added it to the sauce; it gave it good extra flavor. Also, definitely DOUBLE the sauce! The sauce has wonderful flavor & if you made it as written, it's not enough to cover the ribs fully. 2nd, I used fennel instead of the star anise because that's what I had & it makes for a good substitute. 3rd, I used only 1/4 cup honey & I think if I used the full 1/2 cup it would have come out way too sweet. The ribs itself also came out very tender & juicy!  -  OR try this: Here are another reviewers changes. 1 -Buy baby back ribs or back ribs. I usually do @3 lbs. If you want leftovers, I would do more. I also use a big stock pot for this. 2 - I use sweet onions. 3 - I also use sweet soy sauce. I usually use @1/2 cup of the sauce in the pot mixture & when I make the glaze I also use another 1/2 cup of sweet soy sauce. 4 - It doesn't tell you to add liquid to boil the ribs in. I usually add enough beef stock to cover the the ribs along with all the ingredients that it tells you to put into the pot. When the ribs meat start to flake when you put a fork in it then you are done. 5 - I find that the glaze is too little so I usually double it because after I take it out of the pot & put it on the cookie sheet which I wrap in foil.

First I didn't boil the meat.  

Second, it was too hot out to use the oven so I ended up grilling them.   Brushed the ribs with olive oil and put them on indirect heat on the grill for 30 minutes on each side while maintaining  a grill temp between 350 and 400.   Then I turned them again and brushed the top with the glaze and turned them every 5-10 minutes for 35 minutes brushing the top with the glaze each time I turned them.    It's Important to to keep them over the Indirect heat with all the honey in the sauce or they will burn really quickly.  

These were delicious and are a keeper.   Better yet it doesn't heat up the kitchen on a hot day.

I haven't made this recipe, but I've cooked ribs in water exactly this way and then baked for 30 minutes, and what one loses is the flavor of the rib meat itself.  Cooking in water takes away all the food value, in my opinion.

These are so yummy. I replaced the star anise with garlic  just because I don't like the flavor of anise. Also I boiled the ribs in water because it doesn't specify what to use. I was very careful to baste the ribs very regularly and it was worth it.

It was surprisingly tasty. The only thing I think could be improved is to increase the amount of glaze and leave it quite thin. I tried to baste it but was difficult because the sauce thickened quickly in the oven. Will make again!

Best rib recipe ever! Also, if your crunched for time, you really don't have to bake them for the half hour. Ten minutes is fine. It's just to stick the sauce on.

Turned out great! I did cut back on the honey and brown sugar: 1/4 honey and 1/2 TBS brown sugar and used Aloha Brand Soy Sauce. My son gave it a thumbs up and took it for lunch the next day.

Very tasty sauce on the ribs but I'm going to increase the measurements the next time. This recipe does not make enough sauce to evenly cover 6lbs. of spareribs.
