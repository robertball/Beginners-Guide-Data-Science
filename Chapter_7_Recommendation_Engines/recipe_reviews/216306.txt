My husband put this together for me. YUM. We had port wine on hand and just standard cr of mush soup. Used fresh baby carrots and shallots. The outcome was very good.  Hubby got a late start so started on high for first 4 hours. Served one hour later over steamed rice. 
I am quite proud of his new bravery in the kitchen thanks to this website.  We both have recipes sent in emails sent to us each day. And I use the 'ingredient' feature quite often. just as I did with this recipe. It had been sent to me a few weeks back. When hubby asked me, "what do you want me to do with this top round piece if meat?". Ta Da.

This was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!  The ONLY thing I did differently was browm the meat on all sides (not cook all the way, just browm the sides to seal in the flavor).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the tee and the whole family LOVED it!

My husband and I liked this recipe..It was a bit bland so we weren't in love with it but it was very easy to make and not very salty unlike most slow cooker recipes.  We would make it again so it is a keeper.  The only change I made was doubling the meat so that it would be less soup-y.  I still had plenty of liquid.

This is very tasty; however, it is not Beef Bourguignonne.  It is much more like a stew.  Delicious, but not what I was expecting.

The sauce and the smell of this meal is pretty good. The cut of beef called for did get fork tender, but didn't pick up much of the flavors. Overall, it's a nice comforting dish.

Really wonderfully easy slow cooker beef Bourguignonne knock-off.  Def not the real thing but a delicious alternative.  I used sliced mushrooms and roughlyl chopped a whole onion instead of the baby onions (too pricey for me compared to a whole onion) and actually added a packet of brown gravy mix about an hour before serving b/c it was a bit soupy vs stewy.  The gravy mix added some more flavor since it seemed to be lacking in salt and overall flavor.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely be making this again!

I agree that is more like a stew.  Liked vegetables best.  Meat was a little dry, but may have been my selection of steak.

I made a few change I like more veggies, and I browned in red wine and cooked on the stove top. I omitted the soup using fresh mushroom instead that I added to a potato/corn/carrot base. I browned the meat, mushroom,and onions in red wine then added them in. A keeper!

Too much liquid, thyme flavor dominates in an unpleasant way.   Disappointing.

I made this last night & it was delicious! I don't like mushrooms so I deleted them, but I don't mind them in the Golden Mushroom soup. I cut up a quarter of a large onion instead of the jar of onions. This recipe tastes so much better & less salty then the recipes that add Onion Soup mix. I cooked it on high for 6 hours & the beef was so tender. Quick & easy. Enjoy!
