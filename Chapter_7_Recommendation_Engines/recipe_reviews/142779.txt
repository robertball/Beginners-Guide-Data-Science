I make these a lot...easy and yummy!  The easiest way to keep your fruits from browning is to place them in a bowl with Sprite (or any lemon/lime soda combo) so that they all get wet and then skewer them.  It is a lot better than adding lemon juice because the flavor doesn't seem to sink into the fruit.  This trick is also great for fondues.

We made these for a wedding shower.  We took a cabbage and sliced a small piece off the side to make a flat side.  Then we laid it down in a basket.  We poked the fruit skewers into the cabbage so that it looked like a flower arrangement of fruit.  We used blueberrys, strawberrys, melon, pineapple, and grapes.  We even cut the pineapple in star/flower shapes.  It was a beautiful display.

I took this recipe to a baby shower and everyone said what a great idea it was, however, I had a problem with the apples and the bananas turning brown within an hour. Any suggestion on how to keep this from happening are welcomed.

I make these to sell in the concession stand at our summer swim meets and we always sell out and have folks asking for more.  I try to choose fruits that will not brown if they are prepared ahead of time.  My usual combo is cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple (either fresh or canned chunks), strawberries, & red grapes.  But there are lots of great choices that work well.

Fruit skewers make an excellent addition to parties, BBQs, wedding receptions, brunches, etc. I feel the whole reason for displaying fruit pieces on a skewer is to make a beautiful display. I don't believe they can be visually enjoyed laying flat on a serving platter. Instead, why not try using a watermelon as a "basket" in which to stand the skewers up to be enjoyed. Cut the melon in half, be sure to cut a flat surface on the bottom so it can sit straight, then stick your colorful skewers of fruit into the watermelon rind so that it resembles a basket of flowers. It makes a beautiful and inexpensive centerpiece for your buffet or serving table.

It is hard to beat fruit. I didn't give it 5 stars because you need a fairly large surface to work on and it is a bit time consuming. Best to chop all the fruit up and put in into bowls and take an assembly line approach to making the skewers. I borrowed this idea from a catered party. Use watermelon on your skewers and take one half of the hollowed out watermelon and turn it upside down and poke all of the skewers into it. Think of it as a big round porcupine when completed. It makes a really pretty centerpiece.

These are the best and always a hit at parties! They are so easy to make and fun to eat.  I use a combination of strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, pineapple, and grapes. You can use any combination of fruit that you like. I serve them with "Fruit Dip I" from this site and people gobble these up.

Creative, cute and colorful.  Also, a great addition to a buffet table where, let's face it,  a lot of the other dishes are not so healthy or figure friendly.   I used shorter bamboo skewers so they'd hold a more reasonable amount of fruit for one serving and so they'd fit on the plate better. (Wish I would have thought to end each with a grape to cover up the pointy end and make these more attractive...)

Refreshingly different appetizer amongst the usual dips and spreads.  I used a variety of summer fruits as shown in one of the photos: kiwi, pineapple, cantaloupe and strawberries.  I served these with "Big Mama's Fruit Dip" from this site, but most everyone ate them without.  So pretty, and one of the unusual good-for-you additions to the party.

I have done this myself several times - it works great to serve fruit and fruit dip at gatherings. Place the skewers on a fancy platter with fruit dip in rim sugared margarita glasses and it looks quite elegant.

It's kinda funny that people are calling this a "recipe" and haven't heard of this idea before.  But, whatever.  I like serving fruit this way, too, and have done it for many years.  Just wanted to pass on another tip that works really well to keep apples from browning. After you slice or cut them into chunks, cover them with pineapple juice in a glass container.  They stay fresh and white in the fridge for several days.  And you don't notice any pineapple flavor when you take them out of the juice ... they just taste really, really fresh.  It could work for bananas, too, but only for a very short time, as they break down and get mushy pretty quickly.

My son, Matthew (14), made these for part of a Health class project. He says: this is a more interesting way to serve fresh fruit. (He did refuse to call them Fruity Fun Skewers and settled for Fun Fruit on a Stick). We used Pineapple, strawberries, and cantelope. Thanks!

My grandson is crazy about fruit (he'd rather eat fruit than cookies!) & I wanted to make him a birthday treat so I made him a fruit bouquet. I used a mosaic flower pot, lined w/ cellophane & stuffed w/ wet floral foam. I made flowers out of fresh pineapple rings (you are going to want to slice them thickly or they'll break) & skewered them onto two skewers, adding a honeydew ball center. I threaded  grapes on the skewers & filled in the arrangement w/ skewered strawberries, skewered cherry cordial Kisses & chocolate mint. (stuck the mint straight into the floral foam...it made the arrangement smell great!) I "garnished" w/ stick candles ( five because that's how old he is) & a Pixie Stix bow. It was too, too cute! Thanks for a great starting point! BTW I think the skewers laying on the plate is a cute idea too. ;o)

These were really good.  I took them to a potluck instead of a fruit salad and everyone loved them.  I used different fruit based on personal preference.  I made them the night before and brushed on a mixture of pineapple juice, lemon juice, honey & cornstarch (cooked and cooled).  They didn't get brown at and it sweetened up the fruit that was a little green.  They were a little time consuming, but the end product was worth it.

Made these yesterday for a poker night. I thought I made way too many (36 for 8 people) but by the end of the night, they were all gone! I made fruit dip with marshmallow creme and 8ozs cream cheese, with a splash of vanilla and 2 tbsp lemon juice to go along with. Will make again!

I also display the skewers in a purple cabbage that's been flattened to stand firmly.  To prevent fruit from turning brown (apples, bananas...), try cutting them with a ceramic blade.  The ceramic prevents them from turning brown and they'll look good for several hours, if they last that long!

A great portable way to carry fruit on a picnic.  I used cantaloupe, pineapple, kiwi, grapes and strawberries, so no problems with fruit pieces turning brown.

I make these all the time, add a drizzle of melted dark chocolate to really jazz them up.  Just line up the fruit skewers close together on a piece of wax paper, and dip a fork in the melted chocolate, then swing it back and forth over the skewers.

I used grapes, pineapple, strawberries, mango, and Kiwi for very colorful skewers.  I assembled the finished skewers in an easter basket garnished with fresh flowers for a super cute display.  I used floral foam to stick my skewers in and it helped keep my flowers looking fresh.  I assembled the whole thing the night before and it kept well in the fridge for the night.  Thanks for a great idea we can easily personalize.

What a beautiful display of colors! This was fun and creative. I used all the fresh fruits I had on hand to spread it out on skewers following the rainbow's spectrum of colors. This is a healthy addition to parties, luau's and get together's considering all the bbq meats, carbs and spreads usually served at a function.  Best of all it's hard not to eat fresh, juicy and cold fruit on a hot, humid day like Hawaii!

This was alot of fun to do with my kids! We made an assembley line and we each had to skewer on the fruit! We called it Rainbow Fruit Skewers! I had to help my 2nd youngest to pierce through the pineapple. We used Kiwi, pineapple, canteloupe, strawberries and grapes. I served it with a mixed berry sauce!

Such a simple idea for such a marvelous presentation.  We serve these on the boat with friends, sunny afternoon's poolside and as appetizers for barbeques.  They are wonderful easy finger foods that are a cool and refreshing treat, especially on a hot day.   HELPFUL HINT:  If your fruit hasn't reached it's full potential try serving these with Carla's fruit dip from AR; 1 container frozen whipped topping such as cool whip, 1 jar marshmallow creme, 8 ounces cream cheese, and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  It helps to overcome the tartness on fruit that hasn't quite peaked yet.  Thanks Anaj930 for the sweet treat!

Well, we changed the fruit a little (we used strawberries, kiwi, watermelon, mango and pineapple), but it doesn't matter, as long as the fruit is ripe and in season, these are wonderful. They look sooooo pretty and the kids love them just as much as the adults. These are a real crowd pleaser! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these for my mom's 80th birthday party for 55 people. I was afraid they would be more difficult or messy than they look, but they were great! I tried the large skewers with pineapple, melon, kiwi strawberries and grapes (grapes on the end keep the skewers from poking through).
Used the cabbage head in a trifle bowl using 10 inch skewers. Also made 6 inche skewers for arranging on platter beneath the trifle bowl. We did them the night before and stacked between layer of plastic wrap after arranging them in the cabbage (punched the holes in cabbage with the skewers). The fruit stayed fresh and held up well in transport. We had so many comments on how nice it was. No one believed we did in ourselves!

This is a great recipe for parties! I used plastic tropical drink stirs from the dollar store for a summer twist. Everybody loved them!

I just wanted to add a little tip for keeping the fruit from turning color...a little lemon juice works wonders on apples---I'm not sure if it'll do the same for bananas but worth a try.

Very pretty way to serve fruit. I just wonder- the photo shows pineapple & kiwi, but the recipes says banana & apple. Go with the pineapple and you can make ahead. Also substitute the apple for honeydew melon or kiwi. I made these in the morning and kept in fridge until serving later with a fruit dip. A big hit and easy!

This was a huge hit at a recent BBQ.  Because of some of the reviews about the apples and bananas going brown I used kiwis, grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon, strawberries, pineapple and for fun mini marshmallows.  The kids are the party loved the skewers and loved having the marshmallows as a treat.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!

Try adding a marshmallow in the center and on the top  Depending on the season you can find fun colors and shapes.  I just used marshmallows that were shaped liked stars.  My suggestion is to put a sturdy piece of fruit on first.  Pineapple is a good choice.  I used Kiwi, Cantaloupe, Pineapple, Strawberry, Honeydew Melon, Grapes and even Maraschino Cherries.  I created colorful plastic bucket displays by gluing a piece of styrofoam to the inside bottom of the bucket.  I usually can put about 6-8 skewers per bucket.  This makes for great placement at barbecues or potlucks.  We also used the assembly line system to put them together.  You can stack them onto a cookie sheet and wrap with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.

I have been making various versions of this for several years....made them for my daughter's 16th birthday and when I brought them out the kids swarmed the table and had them all gone in a very short time.  For our tastes we use watermelon instead of cantaloupe. Always a hit on buffets too.

I love making fruit skewers. For a party, I take the top 1/4 of a watermelon and stick the skewers into the melon. It is a great way to serve the fruit without needing lots of space. It becomes a lovely display.

Great idea! Pretty much any fruit will do- pick your favorites! I don't like apples with other fruit for some reason and I avoided bananas because they brown. I bought strawberries, grapes, cantaloupe, pineapple and kiwi all from Costco. Love the picture with them skewered transitioning from purple to green color-wise! This is what I did, and then displayed them by sticking the skewers into the outside of half of a watermelon. It made a great presentation at the bridal shower I threw!

I added some pitted fresh cherries that were a big hit. Since it was for a birthday party, I used two round birthday stickers stuck  together to cover up the end of the skewer so they were more decorative.

I made these yesterday for a Mother's Day cookout.  Everybody loved them.  I used watermelon, cantaloupe, kiwi, pineapple, strawberries, and grapes.  They were a huge hit and looked great.  I made it into a centerpiece by cutting the watermelon in half and after cutting all the melon out, I placed one rind cut side down and pushed the skewers into it.

MAde for a wedding shower this past weekend.  I love the rainbow look that someone posted a picture of here so I used the same: kiwi, pineapple, canteloupe, strawberries, and grapes.  I arranged them on a large round tray with the fruit dip in the middle.  People didn't really eat them during the appetizer portion of the evening, but they disappeared around dessert-time.  Thanks for the idea.

I hope this is allowed - but a for serving suggestion/ideas take a look at the website for edible arrangements. Same idea there, but MUCH more expensive than doing it yourself like these!

We made a recipe similar to this for my daughter's bridal shower.  We put the skewers into a decorative flower pot (supported by styrofoam disc in pot).  Looked fantastic! So many compliments.  We served cinnamon fruit dip on the side.

expensive  but a great alternative to one of those edible arrangements.  A   box of strawberries, a honeydew, a cantelope, grapes, a pineapple ....pricy!    but a beautiful addition to any table.   Kids grabbed them before they reached for the cupcakes if you can believe it.

Loved this idea.  Did a trial run with my immed family before trying this out at our annual 4th of July bash.  Made it with Cantaloupe, black grapes and strawberries because that is what I had on hand.  My kids (both boys, 17 and 12) loved them.  Evnthough there was nothing special about the fruit (we have fresh fruit salad all the time) the novelty of the skewers made it fun for them.  WILL definitely make this for the upcoming 4th of July bash to accompany the Fruit Dip II recipe from this site.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT IDEA!

These are both beautiful and delicious!  When I serve these to children, I use straws instead of skewers....avoids the risk of them poking themselves or each other.    A little lemon juice keeps the bananas and apple slices from browning.

These were great.  Like others, I had to use what I had available in my pantry.  We used pineapple, watermelon, grapes, cantalope and strawberries.  Everyone (especially the adults) loved.

Great idea!  You can use whatever fruit you want and dress it up any way you'd like.  I made this for a work retreat day camp and everyone loved it!

Easy and beautiful! Made these for our Easter picnic and they were a huge hit! Be sure to get a large variety of fruit and allow it to ripen. Cut in as equal sizes as possible. My only problem was trying to do it the night before - apples and 'nanas didn't like that too much. Even so, wonderful idea!

Great idea.  Easy to make and a fun way to serve fruit at a picnic or bbq.  I would not include bananas, as they turn brown by the time you arrive at the event.

They look yummy!  For special occasions like July4th, I put star shaped marshmellows on the skewers between the fruit or sometimes just the mini colored marshmellows for a birthday party.

I was looking for a healthy snack idea for my kids and I found it! They loved these colorful skewers that were easily adapted based on what was available in the winter. I did have to omit strawberries and substitute canned Pineapple and canned peaches for this reason. I put them in the fridge and told my kids to help themselves whenever they wanted. They loved not having to ask permission. Next time I may try adding some protien by adding a cheese cube and a ham cube.

Fruity Fun Skewers' Haiku: "Can't rate less than 5! Perfect and adorable! I changed up the fruit." Such a charming way to serve fruit! I loved the one reviewer's suggestion about soaking browning-susceptible fruits in lemon-lime soda, but I ended up skipping that type of fruit all-together and went w/ cantaloupe, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, and red grapes. (Endless possibilities for color combinations depending on a party's theme, or whatever - really a fun way to set out fruit, and these were inhaled by kids and adults alike! Sad to say though, that the fruit dip I served w/ them wasn't touched.)

So simple, but not to be overlooked. I made these on fancy toothpicks for my first grader's end of year celebration. The kids couldn't get enough! I used strawberries, cantaloupe, grapes, pineapple, and watermelon. I put a mini marshmallow on each and mint leaves on some strawberry-only ones.

I made these for a Valentine's day party at my son's school. My son and I had no issues assembling them. They made a very pretty presentation spread out in a fan (looked like a rainbow). And, the kids absolutely loved them! There were no leftovers for me to bring home!

We made something similar to this for my daughter and niece's high school graduation. We cut a round watermelon in half and after removing the fruit (watermelon) we stuck the skewers inthe the outside - placed at each end of the buffet.

The photo immediately took me back to my 2004-5 in the Peace Corps in St. Kitts. A small business workshop was provided, and each group had to create, market survey, and sell their product on the final day. The group I mentored came up with fruit sticks, and they sold really well. But, best of all, the students learned skills that will help them develop small business entrepreneurship for their future, for fruit sticks or big business!

We have been making these all summer and the kids (not to mention the grown ups who come over for BBQ) gobble them up! My 7 yo daughter helps make them, from choosing the fruit to making "patterns" on the skewers. Last time we put them in the freezer until our food was ready. Big hit!!!

This recipe was perfect for a potluck I was bringing fruit salad to. Arranging the fruits on skewers was fun and different and everyone loved it. I would stick to fruits that don't brown so quickly such as grapes, watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple and blueberries. There are a variety of fruits you can pick! If you're using the outer shell of any melon you have for display make sure skewers are shorter so they're easier to insert and do not make the melon shell top heavy.

These are lovely!! A great hit on a summer's day here in Oz. And also, thank you Allyssa for your idea of the watermelon for a base. Terrific idea.
5 stars plus.

Fruit is always such a great idea for kids, a great alternative to sweets.  Finding a fun way to present healthy foods is always useful.  Kids just LOVE these skewers and I love how they look like a rainbow!

Very pretty and tasty! I gave it a 4 because it was very time consuming and I wanted to make sure all pieces of fruit were cut approximately the same size.

This recipe was great!   Easy and kid friendly.   I cut the skewers down before threading the fruit and that worked out well.

Super quick and easy and super versatile!  I used this for a bridal shower I was hosting.  I served them on round platters.  They were pretty to look at!  I chose fruits that wouldn't turn color...like grapes, strawberries, kiwi, watermelon.

I first put a marshmallow at the bottom, then made my way with kiwi, pineapple as the recipe, then a chunk of orange as it was in early Spring  (no melon), half of a strawberry and grape. 
I took it at an after-dance  party and it was a HUGE success . Everybody was extra happy to find this fruit idea far more refreshing and less caloric than any of the present cakes ! and the rainbow colours were attracting people like a magnet :-)

A good way to prevent apples and bananas from turning brown is to mix a bit of salt or lemon in water and dipping it in there.

In the actual recipe a honey lime dressing isn't included.

I have had fruit skewers before and they are festive and pretty, I prefer to save time, effort, and make mine in a bowl w/the honey lime dressing which is included somewhere else on this site as a fruit salad recipe.

I make fruit skewers for our holiday family get togethers all thru the year and also church coffee hour/potlucks.People and children love them and they are healthy.  For the children to keep it safer, I use popsickle sticks from Hobby Lobby/Walmart.  No poky-poky! I love the idea of Sprite to prevent browning.  Many thanks!
