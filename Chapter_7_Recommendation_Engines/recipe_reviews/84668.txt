i found this recipe at the last minute just to add another side to a family birthday dinner, and it turned out to be my favorite thing there!  i used 2 cans french cut green beans and 1 can of WalMart brand Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes, then added just a small amount of Mrs.Dash Tomato/Basil/Garlic seasoning.  it was so simple!  i will definitely keep these items on hand so i can make more on an everyday basis.

Tomatoes and green beans have always tasted great together.  I had never thought of adding almonds.  It added a crisp to it, and tasted great.  A little jalapeno gives it a little kick, kind of like spanish almond green beans.

These are good. I used frozen green beans because I don't care for canned. Had to add a little salt to them. A nice change for green beans, thanks!

This was very tasty and easy recipe. I used fresh Green Beans cause they have more of a crunch and I also added a little bit of feta cheese once it was on my plate...very yummy!

Another great recipe!  I loved these green beens.  I use two cans of green beans and one can of stewed tomatos. I recommend using the canned beans as suggested.  I tried it with frozen green beans and it wasn't nearly as good.

I used Italian spiced stewed tomatoes and since my oven was already on I baked this dish for about 20 minutes.  Easy!

Noone cared for these at all. I made it against my better judgement and it was bland and the texture was not a favorable one.Will not make again.

This recipe is simple, quick, and a nice combination of beans and tomatoes.  I don't like canned vegetables because fresh or frozen always taste much better (using canned ingredients in this recipe is why I gave it a four instead of five star rating).  The first time I made this recipe, I used fresh green beans and tomatoes from my garden but in the off-season, I use frozen green beans.

I normally don't like green beans, but wanting to add a nice, tasty, and healthy side I figured I'd give it a try and boy was I hooked.

Made these one night for my family as a quick dinner side.  I made it without the almonds because I was feeding it to my 14 month old.  He doesn't always enjoy whole vegetables yet, but he devoured these tomatoes & beans & kept asking for "more!"  I will certainly make this again.  Husband & I both thought it gave the beans a good flavor.

maybe it's just me, but these beans were not that great.  I follower the recipe and they were still very bland.  I had to add salt/pepper at the table.

Not so great. I used frozen green beans, so they weren't so mushy and ommitted the almonds since my husband doesn't like nuts. In order to get good flavor, you need to have bean and tomato in each bite. A little too bland.

This came out okay but the beans out of a can and stewed tomatoes made for a rather soft/mushy green bean dish.  Not my favorite but okay to whip up in a hurry

I gave it 4 because I couldn't figure out how to give 3.5.  I liked the contrast of the sweet tomato with the beans, but I felt like something was missing; not sure what.

It is amazing how something so simple and easy can be so tasty.  Of the four of us eating Christmas dinner, only one person said they were good but they didn't care for them. The rest of us loved them.

Super easy, great tasting recipe even my 4 and 6 year old kids loved!  I used peeled crushed tomatos instead of the larger stewed tomatos.

This was better than I expected, for a fairly simple recipe. I made it exactly as written, except that the can of green beans was .5 oz. smaller than specified, and the tomatoes .5 oz. bigger. I was polishing off a jar of Italian seasoning, so only used slightly less than a teaspoonful of that. The recipe didn't say so, but I thought that the green beans needed to be drained - I poured out a lot of liquid from that can, and the final result still had enough liquid to it. I couldn't decide what to have this "side dish" with, so I just ate the whole thing for lunch/dinner. It was surprisingly tasty, and probably pretty healthy too. I liked this a lot!
