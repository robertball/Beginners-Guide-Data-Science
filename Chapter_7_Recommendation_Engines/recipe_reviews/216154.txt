I had so much fun making this today!  This is perfect for a pre-trick or treat dinner for your little ones.  Especially if you have boys!  The recipe for the meatloaf is better than what you usually see for this type of thing.  The Cajun spice and sauteed vegetables are a great addition.  I followed exactly as written but reduced amount of celery down to about 3/4 cup and used an equal amount of onion.  I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture as well.  For the "bloody" sauce I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard.  I added a row of corn kernels to make his mouth.  I thought a real steak knife was a much better touch than a plastic one.  Happy Halloween!!!

Great recipe! It was actually my first time making meatloaf for the family, so I loved the idea of making into a fun shape for the kids. After the first time I made it, I've cut out the celery and added a little ketchup and Worchestershire sauce in the mix. The kids LOVE this, and we make different shapes for different seasons, including a football and Christmas tree!

I made this following the directions almost to a T.  I added a little ketchup to the mix and some extra seasoning.  It was fun and the kids liked it.  Though it took over an hour to cook and you have to be really careful to keep the thickness the same or certain parts will be overdone while others parts are underdone.  If I made this again I would halve the recipe as it was WAY too much for our family of four.  We have been eating the leftovers all week and there is still a bunch left.

Made this for recipe group. What a fun recipe! I didn't add the celery and increased onion, put a little cheese on for effect. A few little tweaks and we enjoyed making and eating this very much.

I didn't like it. It was edible but not enjoyable. I followed the cooking time as well and when a lady at my Bible study cut into it, it was raw in the middle so I let it cook for another 20 mins. The shape and effect of the meatloaf were appealing but I would not recommend the taste!

This is a fun and easy recipe for Halloween.  No one wanted to make the first cut into the stick man. He was a very popular guy! I made the recipe using the ingredients as listed with the exception of using a black olive instead I used banana chips and raisins for the eyes and a sliver of tomato for the lips.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe MissB.

Such a cute idea! I haven't tasted it yet, but I added my own touches including oats and panko, ketchup in the mixture, an extra egg, my own spices, and the rest of the can of black olives. I also fried the veggies in olive oil instead of butter. I'm bringing this "Voo Doo Man", as I call him, to our Halloween potluck tomorrow at work!

Not my favorite meatloaf.  Everyone has a favorite, so I recommend you make your favorite drier so it holds its shape then arrange the dead man in a loaf pan coffin with his arms over his chest.  Garnish his face before you put him in the fiery furnace.  He looks deader.   A spot of bloody ketchup and then stab him in the chest just before serving him up in the coffin.  I like him served with a sculpted mashed potato head with broccoli hair and pools of butter for eyes  and red pepper lips. etc.

I loved this recipe I used carrots for his eyes and mouth and nose but that's because I don't like olives :P
