Good, simple recipe- the peppers can be varied infinitely, of course.  Some sort of sweeter pepper would be good with less sweet corn.  Frozen corn can also be charred in a skillet- takes a bit longer than you might think, it should go in first for this recipe.  Heat of jalapenos does not increase with cooking, it decreases markedly (try a piece raw, if you don't believe me).

Fabulous!  I agree with others that butter should be cut back to 4-6 tbl.

Denny, this side dish was Killer!! I happen to have the SWEETEST corn and pretty hot poblano's in the fridge today. So glad I found your recipe. Grilling this was the way to Go! My corn was not quite done after grilling, so I popped it in the nuker for about 3 minutes to get it a bit more tender. I served this next to Mexican Egg rolls & Spanish rice. THANK YOU Denny.

The flavors were great! Went perfectly with Tex-Mex hamburgers!  We did cut the butter in half, as others suggested, and it was perfect.

Prepared this over the weekend for a holiday gathering and it was a big hit. Definitely do not shy away from this if you're concerned about the heat -- cooking the peppers mellowed them out significantly. In fact, the next time we make this we'll add in at least one more jalapeno and possibly leave in a few ribs/seeds to punch up the heat. The recipe calls for a lot of butter and we found it to be too much. We started with 1/2 cup, saw it was too much, removed about 1/4 cup and it was still too much. I think I'd only use a few Tbsp next time. Also added in a red pepper for a punch of color and that was a vey good idea.

This recipe is a definite keeper!
