Oh my gosh was this a yummy twist for cheesecake!  I had pecans on hand so that is what I used and it turned out AWESOME.  People were expected the usual graham cracker crust and were pleasantly surprised!  I will use this one again without a doubt!!

EXCELLENT pie crust!  I substituted splenda for the equivalent of 2 tbsp of sugar and put SF Chocolate fudge pudding in it.  YUMMMM!  Thank you for a wonderful pie crust!

I have only tried this once and I used it with a tripleberry pie filling (I would not suggest this crust for that).  It is a great crust and I want to use it again with a chocolate pie filling or maybe even apple...  I like the nuts!

Interesting recipe. It was quite greasy but the flavor was very good. I used brown sugar instead of white and I added some nutmeg.

Very good with Banana Pineapple Delight from this site.  I didn't have any ground nuts on hand, so I food processed some walnuts and pecans together.  It worked fine.  I saved some of the sugary, buttery pieces to sprinkle on top for decoration.

Wow! Really tasty - I will use this one again when I want a change from graham cracker or regular pie crust.  I used brown sugar to try to replicate a Raspberry Walnut Tart I had at a restaurant, and the crust was dead on. (Need to work on the filling though!)  Pecans would do nicely also.  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of ground walnuts, I used chopped walnuts instead. And it turns out really crunchy. Great for chocolate fudge pie!

This is a great recipe for those who want to avoid gluten.  It tastes great and holds up to a lot of pie fillings.  Thank you.

I made this recipe as a gluten free alternative for the graham cracker crust called for in a key lime pie recipe from this site.  The crust was easy to make, tasted good and held together well (all things that can be hard to find in gluten free cooking!).  My only "problem" with the recipe was that I had to bake it for longer than the suggested 10 minutes.  I used a 10 inch Le Cresuet stoneware pie dish and had to bake it for 20 minutes.  Also, I was suprised at the amount of "grease" in the crust when it was done baking.  I used paper towels to blot it while it was cooling.  I did notice that it dried more while it cooled.  I cooled it for about 45 minutes and then filled it with the key lime pie and baked an additional 10 minutes.  I can't wait to try this with my great-grandmother's dark chocolate pie recipe!! This is definitely a keeper for me!

This was very good. My husband wanted me to use the salted mixed nuts he ground up so I did. Very rich but so good. I didn't make a pie crust but used it for tiny tarts. Time consuming but worth it. Now he wants me to try it with ground cashews.

Came out a little gooey but tasted good, and held together. It was sweet but not overly so.  Good lower carb option. Complemented the Sweet Potato Pie VII from this site and would make a good Thanksgiving dish.

I'm planning to use this recipe as the base for my sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner. It was my son's idea. The crust is in the oven right now & I can't wait to taste the finished product tomorrow.

Seeing this recipe spurred me to make a nut crust for a tart instead of pastry.  I use brown sugar, and probbly a little less of it, instead of white, plus I bake it a bit longer than called for in the recipe.  Otherwise, it is pretty much the same.  Very delicious with the chocolate mousse filling I was using at the time, also great for cheesecake instead of regular raham cracker crust for a little more crunch.

Very Nice! Used this at the bottom of a spring form pan for a no-bake apple cheesecake. Wasn't sure if the butter should be cold or melted, so I just used some softened room temperature butter & it was perfect.

This crust is awesome.  I have made it with walnuts and also with almonds and pecans. I may try it with macadamia nuts with a French Silk pie.  Today I'm using walnuts and making a pumpkin cheesecake from this site.

LOVED IT! I subbed 1 Tbs. honey for the sugar and used margarine instead of butter. It would make a really good granola too.

I used this for pumpkin pie last fall, using pecans instead of walnuts, and it worked very well! I was afraid it would crumble when cut, but it was actually quite crunchy and held together.  Will definitely try this again, with different pies.

I needed a crust for a friend that can't have gluten, and this worked well.  I filled it with a mix of apples, spices, and honey and it tasted good.  I marked it down strictly because it didn't hold together as well as I had hoped.

I may have put in more butter, but this crust was a little greasy.  Next time I will be more careful.  The crust did taste great though.  Goes well with a light pie.

I baked the crust and the center was soggy so I baked it another 20 minutes before giving up and putting my filling in. I'm not terribly happy with the results.

Most excellent!  I made a chocolate pudding pie and heaped it with whipped cream, covered it with toasted coconut and finished with a caramel drizzle!  And it was too rich!  But sol good!  Banana Dream  Pie next!

Yes. I made it as part of a pumpkin pie and because the crust was baked twice it did get a little brown. I will try it for a no bake pie next.

This was good but I needed to add some almond Flour. It was very moist and without the added flour I couldn't cover the bottom of my pie plate.
