This was very good, my fiance had 3 helpings!! I used a red pepper instead of the yellow pepper since that was what I had in the refrigerator.  I cut up 1/4 cup  yellow onion along with the red pepper and saut√© in with the ground turkey.  I used Pace Picante sauce for the salsa and kidney beans.  Definitely will make again, not typical taco flavoring.
