Soooo good! Made this last week. My husband hates when I try new recipes and he had two bites and said, "This is good. You need to make it again." That's a five-star review from him! Cooking the penne in the cream worked much better than I expected. My Instant Pot doesn't take very long to build or release pressure so I added five minutes and because of that I did add about a quarter cup of extra cream. Perfectly al dente! The chicken was awesome, tender and almost flaky! Making it again tonight!

I didn't have the catanzara spice so left that out.  Otherwise did as suggested except did have to add a little more whipping cream.   Excellent.  Even my picky husband liked it!
