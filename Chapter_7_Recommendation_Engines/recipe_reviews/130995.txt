This was a hearty meal but I did need to adjust a bit as it was a bit bland.  I added some carrots, a cup of beef broth (as there was not enough liquid to cook the potatoes and tenderize the stew meat) and lastly I thought to add some tomato flavor.  I did not have tomato paste but added 2 Tbsp of ketchup and I immediatly knew it just what the dish needed.  I had to cook it longer than 30 minutes to get the meat to a stew type tenderness.  I only used a top pie crust to make it easier.  It cut down the time in the oven and seemed perfect and not overpowering.  I would make this again but with the modifications.  My husband being more of a meat and potato guy would want it again for sure.

Fantastic recipe!!  I browned my diced stew meat first to add that "brown" flavor to the dish, then deglazed the pan w/onions and 2 T minced garlic.  Readded the meat and a bottle of Killian's Irish Red.  I did not have a problem with too little liquid, perhaps because I kept the dish covered as it simmered.  Only other additions were a spoon full of beef base (no additional liquid) and a dash of liquid smoke.  Great and flavorful, even my grandson loved it.

This was delicious and easier to make than I had expected.  I used a ready-made pie crust and a deep dish 9" pan.  I took the advice of other reviewers and left the saucepan covered during all of the simmering steps to preserve the fluids, and I used a bunch of cornstarch (which works better for me with gravies) instead of the flour when making the rue.  Overall a big Superbowl Sunday hit!

I've made a pie just like this except using red wine instead of ale, for years! My family and friends love it.  Being British, I used to use lamb's kidneys instead of mushrooms, but they have not been available for ages, so I began using the mushrooms and the pie has been a hit with everyone! I also use the rolled prepared pie crusts in a box as they bake to a very light, flakey crust that many people can't achieve from scratch. Other than that, the ingredients in my pie are the same and it's one of the best ever!!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this! We used Guinness and it turned out great. The first time, I followed the recipe but also added a few things such as basil and garlic and herb seasoning and some extra onion, not because it needs it, but because we really like onions. The second time, I took a roast and put it in the crockpot with the onions, Guinness and seasonings and let it cook all day. I used the juices to cook the mushrooms in and then combined everything. I made a package of beef gravy to top it with on our plates.Thanks so much for this great recipe! I think it will be a new staple in my house.

This was Awesome!  I didn't quite follow the recipe as written, but I didn't change much.  I used an imported beer from the UK (boddingtons).  It came in a pint can and, after reading some of the reviews about too little liquid, I used all of it.  I put the beef, onions and beer into a casserole and cooked in the oven for about 2 hours at 300f.  I did this in the morning and left the meat in the cooling oven.  This made the meat extremely tender and allowed the flavor from the beer to be fully absorbed.  I transferred the meat, onions and beer to a saucepan and continued to follow the recipe exactly.  I didn't change anything else and it was absolutely delicious!  My husband had been waiting for me to make this pie for some time and he was not disappointed.  He has not stopped talking about how good it tasted.  This will definitely be a favorite in our family!

Definitely the best beef pie filling I've ever made. I followed the recipe closely, with minor changes: I used fresh thyme, fried the onions and simmered the beef gently for an hour (with lid on). I added 2 small carrots, sliced, with the potatoes. Because we're trying to lose some weight we gained over Christmas, I used a mashed potato topping in stead of the pastry (and reduced the amount of potato in the filling). The whole family gave it 5 stars!

Good. Added carrots and beans. Also used 2 bottles pale ale (and a bit of water) because not enough liquid. Used thyme, basil and oregano.

Thank you Master Chef L!! This was fabulous! It was my first time tasting steak&ale pie so it really did leave an impression.  (I'm from Thailand, they don't make it here) Also, thanks to everyone who commented because they were very helpful.  I made 2 pies so I kept one pot covered and the other not.  The covered pot had more flavor than the uncovered.  I also used Guinness for ale and marinated the meats in Soy Sauce (it's a Thai thing) before browning it and it was pretty good.  Everyone at my office is raving about it and that's saying a lot because it's very difficult to please Thai people with Western food.  My British friend said it was amazing.  Again, thank you Mrs. L! You're the best!

This pie was excellent as it is. Ever since I returned from Scotland I have been craving a meat pie. This pie hit the spot. Hearty and flavorful. Follow the recipe and you will be fine. I don't think people should rate this recipe if they have made changes.

Very tasty. Will definitely make again but without thyme. There was a bitter background taste that I didn't care.  Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this recipe once with my mom, we used 3 cans and a little water to add a bit more liquid to the pie. It was an excellent pie and sooo easy to prepare, doing it again for a school project

Not bad, but I think I don't like the combo of thyme, worchestershire and ale - a little too bitter.  A chunk of cheddar and a bite of bread did help with the bitterness, though.  I did add a little more garlic and a boullion cube.  Next time I think I will add more garlic and onion and leave out the thyme and worchestershire.

I dredged the meat in some flour and browned it first.  Then I added a tablespoon of tomato paste, browned it, then added the onions and garlic. Then the beer (I used Killian's Irish Red) and about 1/2 cup of water and some beef base. This meat was no where near done in 30 minutes.  I had to simmer it for about an hour and a half to get it tender.  The cooking liquid had a nice beefy flavor until I added the Worchestershire sauce and thyme.  These two ingredients did not blend well together.  They gave the dish a sharp, almost piney off-flavor that we did not care for.  I used carrots and peas instead of potatoes and I think this would have been good without the W-sauce and thyme.  If I were to make this again, and I'm not sure I will, I would put in a bay leaf instead.  Thanks for the post.

FANTASTIC!!  Followed the recipe but made small changes, added carrots like the reviews said, omitted the thyme and added 1/2 cup of beef broth for more juice. Husbands went for seconds! Will for sure make this again and again!

I modified this recipe, mostly because I really, really dislike mushrooms, but I really like steak and ale pie. 

I marinated 1lb beef in the worcestershire sauce, thyme, garlic, and parsley (1/2 tsp dried instead of 1 1/2 tsp fresh) for 6ish hours before I cooked it, and took the meat out about an hour before I cooked it.

I tossed the bite sized cubed potatoes in a little olive oil, salt and pepper, and another 2 tablespoons of garlic. Instead of mushrooms, I cut up 3 carrots into bite sized pieces and tossed with a teaspoon of sugar. I baked the potatoes and carrots at 475 for 10-15 mins on aluminum foil over a baking sheet. 

I sauteed the beef and onions in a tablespoon of butter until the beef was browned and the onions were soft - adding salt and pepper to taste. Added a bottle of Guiness (11.5 oz I think), 3 beef bouillons, and sauteed for a bit. Spooned out the meat and onions and put the beef mixture and the potatoes/carrots in a big mixing bowl and set them aside. 

Reduced the Guiness, and mixed a spoonful of it with the flour then added that back to the sauce - came out thick.

I poured the liquid into the big mixing bowl, stirred a little, then spooned the reduction into the pie pan, too.

I only used a top pie crust that I had made from scratch - when I made it the first time I found two crusts were just too much (and I love crust!). 

Baked at 375 for 50 mins, and... delicious. Thanks for a yummy recipe! My boyfriend from the UK loves it.

This pie was fantastic!  I used a big can of Guinness, added some carrots and about 1/4 cup of ketchup for a little extra flavor.  I think the longer you stew the meat, the better.  Mine simmered for at least an hour.  Super yummy!!

Great meal. Take time to brown your beef first, then sweat out the veggies to help deglaze the pot. Used Cabernet instead of the Ale. Also, used 3-5 tablespoons of flour with 1/4 cup of wine and 1/4 cup of the sauce to thicken it up. Puff Pastry worked well on the top, made a nice light fluffy "hat" for dipping.

This was so, so bland. I tried adding ketchup, like one reviewer suggested, but it didn't do much to change the bland taste. Nothing else I added could redeem it.

Mmm!!! This made my house smell so goooood. I used leftover moose roast, left all the seasonings etc. the same. I realized last minute that the only flour I had left was rice flour, so, gross, and I thickened it with an envelope of Hunter gravy from Knorr instead. I don't know, I think that it would have been just as amazing with the recipe as it is. Next time I will make it as the recipe calls for, and see how it goes. Thanks for this, we love it! Cozy winter food.

Instead of putting this in a pie, we ended up having this as a wrap with a lot of cheese. It was delicious - very creamy and rich.

The rating I gave was for the recipe as written. There was not enough liquid to cook the meat and the potatoes good and soft. I followed one review and added broth. But there was not enough liquid to add the flour to and make it creamy. I added cream of mush soup to try and make it creamy. I then added a lil more beer. But the beer was over powering. It gave it a funny after taste. It could have just been the beer I used. I may try and use red wine like person suggested, or a different beer. I think this recipe could be good, but just not as written.

I used leftover petite sirloin steaks that we grilled last night, only half the beer (I was reluctant to use all of it because I've had recipes turn out poorly with a whole bottle), a little more flour, and browning sauce (Kitchen Bouquet) instead of Worcestershire sauce.  I'm convinced that browning sauce makes all beef based recipes like this taste better.  And it sure was good, my fiance and I loved it!  He said it was "somewhere between amazing and awesome."  I can't imagine the pie turning out any better than it did.

I did not care for this.  It was very bitter.  My husband was able to eat it with a ton of ketchup, I wasn't able to tolerate the bitterness.  I used Corona beer.  I don't know if another brand would have been better.  This is the first thing I've made from this website that I did't really care for (I've made about 20).

Made this last night, and I also had problems with the amount of liquid left in the pan by the end, when following the cooking times.  I added some water, but think another bottle of beer at the beginning, or the addition of beef broth would have done the trick.  I also tweeked the spices, adding in ground sage, some carrots.  It had a great flavor, but was a tad dry inside the crust.  I also sprinkled a little shredded cheddar just before putting the top crust on, gave a nice taste.  I would try this again for sure, just with some more 'gravy' inside.  Thanks!

Review Aug 26, 09:  I started with already cooked steak meat, which I cubed and dumped in the pot with the rest of the ingredients.  Although I did cut the potatoes a little larger, it takes much longer than noted in the recipe to cook them.  So much so, actually, that I ended up adding another bottle of beer to the mix as well as about 1/2 c of water since the beer simmered off.  I don't like mushrooms or steak at all, so I'm making this for the bf.  I'll update when he tries it.  It does smell good, I'll admit, though.  I used the No Fail Pie Crust I from here for this meat pie.  Thanks for the recipe!  **Update:  Bf seemed to like this, which is good since I made him eat it every meal until it was gone.  He apparently decided it was good enough to eat in quarters, not in 8ths like pies are generally cut.

We only made the filling for this.  We used leftover roast that had been cooked in a slow cooker with beef consume and canned onion soup.  We onitted the potatoes but added the rest of the ingredients.  Instead of a pastry crust e just the potatoes called for in the recipe to make mashed potatoes.  We topped the meat mixture with the mashed potatoes prior to baking.  Turned out wonderful.  Very flavorful meat mixture indeed.  So, we didn't follow the whole recipe so I can't say how that would have been.  I just know that meat part was great.  Thanks for the recipe. Will use this in the future to do the same thing.  Oh, and for the beer we used a vey dark one from a local micro brewery.

I was really looking forward to eating this.  I love cooking with Guinness, so we used it.  It smelt fabulous while cooking, but that was where it ended.

The pie crust didn't match (maybe just a bad recipe...although a mashed potato topping could be good).  The insides were rather bland.  

I may make it again, only because I want it to be good.  But I would season it with salt and pepper (for starters) and add some beef bouillon and try a different beer, I guess.

The filling turned out fine, however, I should have made my own crust (was too sweet) and not used the thyme.  I thought the thyme gave it a weird flavor.  If I were to make it again, I'd leave out the thyme and make my own crust.  I'd also probably add a few more spices!

I made this with Guinness, and I omitted the parsley. I also didn't bother with the pastry - just served it as a stew. As written it's ok, but kinda bland. I added some garlic powder, a couple of beef buillon cubes and more Worcestershire sauce. Turned out pretty good. Thanks, Mrs L!

I wanted to try and make this simplier. I put most ingredients (except mushrooms)in the crockpot in the AM. Forgot to get onions, so added dry onion soup mix. Added mushrooms right before going into the oven. Didn't have pie crust, so tried Bisquick topping.  Family really liked it. Will make this again, maybe without the dry onion soup try and real onions.

Pretty good. I went with others suggestions and simmered the beef and onions for about an hour, covered, to get the meat tender. Next time I will try a stronger beer and triple the garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  Also, I skipped the mushrooms since I don’t like them.

I think the only change I made was the addition of half of a second bottle of beer ( I used Newcastle Brown Ale), and a little more meat than called for because the chuck roast I bought was around 2 lbs. I thought it was pretty tasty!

I used two cans of Guinness and market fresh herbs, plus I added carrots and about a 1/4 more meat and potatoes. I had to use tendeflake premade pie shells that were abit shallow.  this recipe was enough to fill two shells quite well and used two more shells to cover the top.

I tweaked this recipe to make a proper English pie, adding bouillon to 1/2 cup boiling water and using this to add the flour to for gravy for the pie as I was making 8 individuals. Also added 1/2 cup sliced carrots and a can of drained peas. I used Old Speckled Hen for my ale choice (its like 16-20 oz) and browned the meat for a few minutes in a little olive oil to really bring out the meat flavor, the added the onion and ale. My English friend said it was exactly as her mum would make, even the crust was perfect. I hand make my crusts.

I followed the recipe but added corn and black beens. I also brushed butter on the top pie crust before baking. It was excellent . I gave some to my daughter and her husband and they raved about it. Will definitely do it again on a cold winter night!! Comfort food!

I've never had steak and ale pie, but my boyfriend was seriously craving some. Great first round! Boyf says the flavor was on point. His only recommendation was that the beef should be a bit more tender (I simmered it for an hour)...next time, I'll prob do what others did and stick it in the crock pot all day before putting it in the crust. I used the "No Fail Pie Crust" recipe on this site, and he loved it. Super easy. I recommend using the butter flavored crisco though. Oh...and I added a beef bouillon cube to add some flavor. Spot on.

Great recipe base. I used about 2 lb of beef and browned it first and added a large 500 ml (approx 17 oz) can of Smithwicks Ale. I also added a carrot to get some more colour and another veggie. By adding more stuff, my pie was a little full but still fit into a 9" pie plate.

A great recipe base that needed very little modification at all. I carmelised the onions first, to give it a bit of extra sweetness.  I recommend Guinness as the beer - it keeps the gravy dark and hearty.  I also threw in a dash of scotch at the beginning to give it a little extra spice.  Tomato is also a good addition, if you like the flavour that it provides.

We enjoyed this. Five year old wouldn't touch it but 8 and 2 year old enjoyed it.  I thought the ale flavor was a bit strong (I don't like beer) so next time I will do 1/2 beer, 1/2 beef broth.  I'm sure DH will be happy to 'dispose' of the extra beer!  Did add carrots.

As suggested, doubled the number of beers (used Guiness). Used stewing beef and it came out very nicely. People loved it. Next time, wiil use more veggies, (baby carrots, pearl onions, etc)

After reading all the reviews I can safely say that this recipe does need extra liquid. I thought I had simmered it too long, but it would have been great with the addition of some beef broth. I had to simmer the meat about 50 minutes instead of the 30 because after 30 minutes the stew meat was just rubbery - maybe I didn't use good enough meat. Also, unless you really like worcestershire, I'd start with one tablespoon and add more to taste. Other than that it was quite tasty and filling.

My husband and I really liked this recipe, although at the end, I added a package of brown gravy mix and enough water to make it saucy enough. Also used a 10" pie plate and only put a crust on top. Next time, I will use only 1# of beef and more mushrooms and omit the thyme. We thought the flavor was great!
