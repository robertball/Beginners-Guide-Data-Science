My pantry was getting pretty bare and I was having a major sweet craving.  Found this recipe through an ingredient search.  Very addicting.  Between three of us two pies were gone in a day.  I will be making this for Christmas.

This pie is fantastic!  I've made it multiple times and it turns out well every time.  In the last year I've been diagnosed with Celiacs so I thought I'd try making this gluten free.  I substituted the flour for 1/4cup corn starch and it turned out even better than it did with the flour.  This never lasts long.

I was bored and my sweet tooth got the best of me, so I went searching for a desert that was easy and cheap to make. I tried this pie and WOW. It was very easy to make and minimal clean up afterwards. Two thumbs up for the taste, texture and the miraculous crust. I was really happy with the finished pie. This will never replace all the traditional pies, but it is unique, fun to make and tastes great.

This is an awesome EASY recipe....the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it doesn't really have a 'crust' like a pie it's almost more like a flan.  I would call it a crustless sugar pie, but it's still delishious!
I saw a review that asked how to avoid it falling in the middle....if it isn't completely cooled to room temp before it goes in the fridge it will sink in the middle.

This pie was very good and very sweet!!  I made it one weekend and it was gone quickly.  It did take longer for it to bake than the recipe said but it was worth the wait.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Simple amazing pie so easy ! Followed the instructions exactly as stated, turned out perfect! It formed almost a floppy soft gram type crust. The edges where just a little burned and tasted like a campfire marshmallow. I definitely will be baking this one again! A+++ delish ! Awsome recipe ! Big thank you CTREYNARD !

DeLiCiOuS sugar cream pie!  I like pie, but I donâ€™t care for crust.  This was the perfect pie for me.  There is no crust, well sort of; the ingredients form a crust like bottom, without it being a crust.  The filling is so light and creamy and bakes up beautifully.  I baked as instructed, but it took longer than the 50 minutes stated.  I did cover with foil after 35 minutes, but mine took 25 more minutes for the center to set.  I completely cooled the pie and refrigerated for about 3 hours before serving.  Thanks CTREYNARD for sharing your recipe.  I look forward to trying your two other published pie recipes.  This one is sure a keeper in my book!

Made a surprisingly yummy pie! Super easy and I like that it makes its own crust on the bottom. I will make this again and don't think I'd ever change it :D

This was my first time making Sugar Pie and everyone loved how it turned out. But, I think that I messed something up when I was making it. The battered seemed runny so I added a little more flour and it took longer to bake. I love that fact that it had its own crust and I do plan to make this again again. Next time I will pay more attention ;-) My 9 year old said that only mistake that I made was only making one pie lol

Omg this is so delicious!!  I realized last minute I didn't have enough brown sugar, so I ended up using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar.  I thought it worked out just fine!!  This was a little bit hard to get out of the pan, very sticky, but I got it to work.  Great recipe!!

I am a little confused. I bake a lot so was surprised to see that 1/4 cup butter was enough to get "creamy" and very well combined with 2 cups of brown sugar. Since none of the reviews mentioned this not working I followed the recipe.  When my Kitchen Aid was unable to make that ratio of butter and brown sugar anywhere near a consistency that could be reasonably described as creamy I increased the butter to 1/4 lb total. This ratio worked and I wondered if 1/4lb (one stick) was actually what was intended?? Either way 1/4lb of butter worked for me (with the rest of the ingredients as listed). As other reviews mentioned my pie took a fair bit longer to cook and the center didn't appear set while in the oven. Once I removed it and let it sit for a bit on a cooling rack it started to firm up. A nice crust formed on the bottom and the sides were nice and crispy.

I happened to have some maple sugar I received as a gift so I used that. I also made it gluten free by substituting GF flour. I replaced the vanilla with maple syrup. I baked it for 5 minutes longer than the given time as the centre was a little jiggly, but the edges were so good that when making again I would leave it in longer to increase the 'crusty' area. I served it with just a little vanilla ice cream. It was a hit with the guests at a French-Canadian themed dinner.

Something sweet and yummy and I don't have to run to the store?! Yes, please! I actually tried to make this three times and it never set right. I purchased an oven thermometer and realized that my oven temp was way off. I adjusted and tried again. The flavor of the pie was so good that I kept trying it until I got it right.

The pie was a cinch to make but it took longer to bake than specified in the recipe. I thought I made a mistake with the batter being really runny/loose but the center set up nicely when baked longer. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks delicious and smells great! Can't wait for my friend to try it. This is "payment" for fixing my old dresser drawers. He is AWESOME!

Followed the recipe. Wondered if the batter was too runny, but it turned out great. Perfect for when you want something sweet but also want to use minimal ingredients with minimal effort.

Possibly the worst version of this pie. It does not taste anything like the Quebec sugar pie, it lacks sugar, and has a strong egg taste. Just a waste of time and money

No, not even close! ... "Miraculous" is the last word I would use to describe this pie! Not sweet enough, the filling is bland, more like a custard and has an unpleasant egg aftertaste. 

A real good French-Canadian sugar pie recipe would NEVER ask for eggs or milk, even evaporated milk! Our best sugar pies are made with brown sugar, heavy cream and/or Eagle Brand condensed milk; they are much sweeter, richer in taste, buttery and creamy and often contain maple syrup too.  You know you have a perfect sugar pie when each bite is a party of flavors that melts in your mouth and that the texture is like velvet on your palate.

Had to make a quick thank you for a good friend, this was super fast, easy and absolutely wonderful. 
Didn't change anything except I swapped a small amount of heavy cream for a 1/4 of a cup of the milk.
Perfect pie ! Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! My neighbor said he doesn't eat any sweets except sugar pie which I'd never heard of. I was skeptical looking at the ingredients but it is terrific. I only used the 1/4 cup butter as written and it didn't cream together with the sugar. Just resembled course sugar crumbs. I followed the rest of the instructions until the milk and it was a creamy batter but then was runny on adding milk so I stopped after 1 cup.  Cooked up perfectly in the recommended time. I could've eaten half the pie myself!

I modified the recipe quite a bit and it came out amazing! Full stick of butter, 1 can of evaporated milk instead of the 1.5 cups it called for. I also substituted rum extract for the vanilla and added some cinnamon.  I poured the filling into an actual pie crust since we LOVE crust at my house! Sprinkled chopped pecans on top. Bake time was still 50 min. I did not cover with foil, but moved the pie to the lower rack for the last 20 min.

I thought this half pie was a bit too bland following the directions exactly. So tried again but poured the filling into a shortbread pie shell and added pecans. What a difference!! I will definitely make this recipe again but with the additions and i think i'll try drizzling chocolate and caramel on top.

I'm only giving this pie two stars because even though I liked it my three teenagers didn't like it at all.
