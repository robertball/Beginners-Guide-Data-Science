Simple, basic recipe that is easy to personalize. Brown some meat or sausages with or without an onion. Add whatever spices you like to the sauce. My suggestion: use 9 noodles - 3 per layer. Don't overlap. They expand quite a bit!

I have been making this recipe for awhile now.  I do have a couple of changes though, I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta (my kids don't like ricotta and cotage cheese is cheaper) and like other reviews I add one pound of ground beef.

Pretty good. I didn't have time to boil the noodles (I usually tear a few anyway). The only change I made was to add a pound of cooked ground beef to the sauce. I will definitely do this again.

this was my first homemade lasagna and i thought it was delicious! i agree with what some have said, i may add some extra italian herbs next time, but everything else was great. i only had lasagna noodles that had to boil, so i cooked them very al dente and then added them as directed. i also added cooked ground beef into the ragu and it was great! a great recipe for quick, delicious lasagna!

great recipte very easy and I love not having to boil the noodles;however, i added 1 lb of lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground italian sausage. I also added garlic salt, italian seasoning (mix of oregano, basil, parsley, etc) to the sauce and the ricotta mixture and extra 8 oz of soft block sliced mozzarella. I used the chunky ragu sauce(garlic,onion, tomatoes) and added a can of diced and drained tomotaes w/ basil and garlic.

PERFECT! Followed it exactly like it called for in the recipe (with the minor exception that I added 1 lb of ground beef inbetween the two layers of ricotta) and it came out WONDERFUL!!!

My 12 y.o. son had began to not be interested in anything that I prepared, so I thought it would be a good idea to have him help make this dish in hopes that he'd eat it.  Wow, it was the best lasagna ever & my husband loved it too!  This is a keeper!

This recipe was amazing! It was so hard to wait the full 1 hour & 10 minutes while we smelled it baking, but it's definitely worth the wait! I was looking for a simple lasagna I could make while also adding my own extra ingredients. I didn't use ricotta or mozzarella cheese. I used colby monterey jack cheese, I added boneless, skinless chicken cut into cubes, mushrooms, broccoli, & velveeta American cheese, as well. I also added Italian seasoning, a little salt & pepper on the chicken, a little garlic powder, & it was ready. I will definitely be making this wonderful recipe again!

The Ragu sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise it was delicious, and the noodles were fully cooked!

My fiance and I both liked this lasagna, but I think it would have been a little bland without my additions. I used whole wheat pasta noodles, which can soak up more liquid in this type of recipe, so I soaked them in hot water while I prepped the other ingredients. I chopped up half an onion and sauteed it, then added a pound of ground beef and cooked until browned. I poured both jars of pasta sauce into the beef, and added chopped parsley, oregano, and minced garlic. I also added an extra cup of shredded pepper jack cheese to the cheese mixture, and it turned out to be the perfect amount of cheese. This is a great starter recipe, but it definitely needs some custom additions to your liking.

Very easy and quick. I used drained cottage cheese instead of ricotta(all I had). Worked great. I also added some sauteed garlic, crushed red pepper, onions, and mushrooms for some added flavor. I liked that it was a no boil recipe that called for the regular noodles. They are cheaper than the no boil ones.

It's a good, easy lasagna.  It's not the best I've had, but it is good for a quick lasagna.  I added a 1-lb mixture of sausage and beef, saute'd some mushrooms and onions to add in and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  The best thing is that my girls ate it because it's not too spicy and a little bit sweet.  I will make this again.

Excellent recipe! I cut it in half for only 2 of us, used a 9 inch pan and still have a load to freeze for another meal. We fried ground turkey and onions to add to the sauce for more substance and assembled it early in the day so all the ingredients sat together in the fridge for a few hours before baking. We'll make this again - thanks for the recipe!

I made this in a 7 by 11 inch pan using 8 lasagna noodles, 1 26 ounce jar of Prego sauce, 1 15 oz container of ricotta, 1/4 cup parmesan, and a little dried basil mixed in with the cheese.  I thought it turned out pretty darn well!  It was so easy to make.  My fiance thought it was a little dry (he's used to my regular lasagna, which is excessively saucy), but I didn't think so.  Considering how time consuming normal lasagna is to make, I will definitely be making this again.  Also, I see that a couple other reviewers were confused by how you're supposed to layer the ingredients.  VLB, the recipe does call for all the ricotta.  It says to use half the ricotta, then repeat the layers (which would result in using the other half).  And MOMOFADDY, the recipe says to use all 12 lasagna noodles.  It says to layer 4 in the dish, then repeat the layers (which would mean another layer of 4), then to put 4 more on top.  I'm not sure what the issue is with people not understanding the recipe's instructions.

I have made this lots of times.  Add a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the browned ground beef and sauce mixture.  I also add 1 box of drained thawed spinach to the cottage cheese.  I add one egg yolk too, to help them bind together.  And I soak the noodles in a pan of hot water to soften them before baking.  Pretty tasty meal with some garlic bread and salad.

I used 2 cans of Hunt's sauce, 1 "3 cheese" and 1 "spicy and zesty".  Could have used a little salt and pepper.  I also used whole wheat pasta, which can be drier, so I added the left-over cup of sauce in during the baking, and also used 9 lasagna noodles instead of 12 as another reviewer suggested.  Turned out great; did have to bake a little while longer (maybe b/c of the wheat).  It definitely would have been dry without the extra sauce and the reduced number of noodles.  Oh, and I put in 1 lb ground beef.  It barely all fit in a 9x13.  Lots of leftovers!

This is my favorite lasagna recipe. I have tried others but this one is the best. The recipe says to make sure you cover when you put in the oven, I was out of foil once and put it in the oven without covering it and it still came out delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I have tried this recipe several times now. I do substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta and I also add 1 pound of cooked ground mild Italian sausage. This is a quick and easy recipe that I like and will continue to make.

Awesome and easy. Taste great, my wife and I loved it. I ended up using what I thought to be too much sauce, and it still turned out great. I used Ragu tomato and basil sauce... it rocked. Thanks for this one its a keeper.

Making this tonight for the second time. I love this recipe! It's sooo good and super easy. Make sure to use plenty of sauce though, it can get a bit dry.

I made a 'semblance' of this recipe. I used cheap spaghetti sauce and added 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage. It was very good. Next time I may add garlic and Italian seasonings.  But, I have to say it turned out well without the addition of anything but the meat.  It was wonderful to be able to make lasagna without boiling the noodles first. Good recipe.

Made this for company last night and it was a hit.  I added ground beef and a little bit of country sausage and italian seasoning.  Also, I had a LOT of the ricotta mixture left over at the end, so either the recipe is off or I missed something!  I think one container of ricotta would have been enough.  Will definitely make again.  And in case anyone is wondering, I used regular lasagna noodles (not no-boil noodles), only 3 per layer and they cooked up perfectly.  Even the kids were asking for seconds and thirds!

Been using no boil Lasagna noodles for years. The secret it to add water to the sauce, I usually use about 1/4 cup per jar of sauce - use it to rinse out the last bits of sauce left in the jar and add it to the mix, those no bake noodles really soak up the sauce. I also add ground beef, lots of garlic and some Pepperoni to kick it up a bit.

I also use a pound of ground turkey seasoned with S&P, Italian seasoning and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic.  I substituted ricotta with cottage cheese for the same reasons as the previous rater.  Yummy!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy.  We add hamburger in as well and it tastes just as good.  It freezes well also so we usually get 2 or 3 meals out of it.

I added ground beef to it, since my family loves it that way. I thought the serve with remaning sause was kinda weird but it was dry so it needed it or just add more sause to each layer.

Two containers of ricotta seemed excessive. I only used one & added ground beef & spices. The extra cheese was not missed.

I was so impressed with how easy this recipe was and how tasty it turned out!  I did add fresh sauteed mushrooms and 1 lb. of ground beef to the recipe. I found I needed extra Rague to ladle on each serving.  The uncooked lasagna noodles soaked up alot of the sauce and I thought it was a bit dry.  Thank goodness I had an exra jar of Rague.  I will definitely make this again!

I used all the sauce and added a pound ground turkey. I used low fat mozzarella, 1 low fat and one fat free ricotta. Mine came out way too dry and lacked any sort of "ooey-gooey that makes a lasagna so good. It was probably more the fault of the lower fat ingredients than the recipe itself.  The technique and time worked perfectly. It needs more seasoning. I even stirred Italian seasoning, and garlic into the ricotta mixture but it was still bland.

I loved how easy this was to prepare. However, with just plain hamburger it tasted bland and the ricotta gave it such a weird texture.  Next time I make this I will use sausage and use cottage cheese

I am writing about the meat lasagna. It was so gooey and it ran down your mouth. And the salad was so good that I about burst into flames. It was so easy to make.
