This recipe was great.  Easy, healthy and delicious.  I used cherry tomatoes and added a splash of white balsamic vinegar.  YUM.  My mother in law makes the same thing with green beans, also very good.  I will make this again soon!  Thanks.

This was the first year I had to cook for a large family gathering. It was Thanksgiving this year. I did both asparagus and green beans. I brought the green beans to my aunt's house for dinner and everyone was asking who made them. They loved them!!! I made the asparagus a few days later at home for my boyfriend and I only because it's so much more expensive. It was great with both vegetables! I did add extra tomato and garlic to the recipe just because I wanted to make a more dramatic flavor, but I loved loved loved this dish! Yum!

Some of my tips: 1) Chopping asparagus into thirds will make them a more manageable length when eating. 2) Check for and discard pieces of asparagus (especially the pieces closest to the ground) that are woody... they won't be be pleasant to chew later.  3) Put the thicker pieces into water right from the start. Add the asparagus tops to the water later, because they need shorter cooking time.    All in all, this is a simple and great recipe for one of the best vegetables in existence: Asparagus!

This was excellent!  I roasted the asparagus at 450 for 14 minutes rather than blanch it.  I tripled the garlic and increased the tomatoes to about 4 large tomatoes.    DEELISH!

I intended to make these on another night, but Hubs nixed the idea because he didn't think he'd like this so I went with something else.  But that didn't work tonight, and I'm glad I went with it anyway. Turns out we both enjoyed this!  I did change the cooking method, however, cooking the tomatoes separately, then using them to top the asparagus, which I blanched for two minutes then shocked in ice water. I liked this method, which preserved the integrity and color of both the tomatoes and the asparagus.

This is a great recipe! I used fresh green beans instead and fresh garlic and a bit of onion powder and dry parsley flakes. I finally found a good side dish that is not fattening.

Very Yummy, I actually turned this this recipe in to shrimp pasta dish.To the basic rec pie I changed a few things   -3 Tablespoons of Olive oil -5 cloves of garlic - white wine to it towards to end to taste - other herbs that I don't remember, pinch here and there. - and obviously shrimp and egg noodle pasta.  I cooked everything as directed, added some shrimp in at about the same time I added the asparagus. I tossed with egg noodle (what I had on hand). It came out lovely... the tomatoes blended well with the olive oil and made a tasty sauce. Its something I will certainly make again!

Fixed this last night, in between tornado warnings, and everyone agreed it was great(didn't leave a single bite in the dish). Flavors mingled nicely with none overpowering. Only change I made was in amount of EVOO--I reduced it a little.  Served along with roasted new potatoes and baked ham for a very Springtime meal.

Pretty good!  Use 1 1/2 tblspn of oil, 3 tsp garlic, and pretty heavy on the pepper.

Disappointing. Not flavorful enough. Tomatoes did not help. I do not know why this had so many good reviews.

The asparagus was very tasty without any bitterness.  I followed the recipe but left out the crackers and simmered it about 2 minutes more to soften the asparagus more.

Perfect side for my 2011 Mother's Day meal. It was flavorful, fresh and a cinch to make. I will definitely be making these asparagus again.

This recipe turned out very nicely. I added the tomato and garlic at the same time and cooked a little longer than specified, but followed all other directions as listed. Yum.

I roasted my dish instead of doing the skillet method. I used way more garlic than called for only for personal preference and added chopped onion. This went well with lemon chicken and goat cheese baked potatoes.

My husband and I really liked this. I also used cherry tomatoes as another reviewer had done and I did use more garlic because we love garlic. I will definitely make this again. It's a nice change from the roasted asparagus I usually make.

A great way to enjoy the abundance of tomatoes from the garden!  I added chicken (already cooked) and a few stray peas from the garden.  Sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese and it is an entire meal!

This was the perfect side for our Mother's Day dinner. I used grape tomatoes because they are so much more flavorful this time of year but otherwise followed the recipe. It was terrific. Even the non asparagus eaters enjoyed it.

Great and easy recipe that goes with everything. The only change I made was to replace the garlic with an Adobo light seasoning. Perfect!

I actually came up with something similar last night! The only thing I did different was cook the asparagus in a pan on the Traeger, I like the smokey taste, and add fresh lemon juice. Added the tomatoes toward the end of cooking. Turned out awesome!

I made this as directed, except for substituting cherry tomatoes. My family liked it as a nice variation on asparagus. Very easy and quick. Maintains good veggie flavor & texture.
