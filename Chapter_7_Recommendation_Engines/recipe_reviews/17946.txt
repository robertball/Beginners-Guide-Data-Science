This was soooo simple, yet it was still very good, considering it was basically pudding in a crust, lol! I used candied pecans (just on the top), sugar free chocolate pudding and fat free whipped topping, which I just piped on the top. I used the directions on the pudding box for making a pie because I wanted it to be firmer. I allowed it to refrigerate several hours, and that seemed to do the trick. We all enjoyed this 5 minute-to-make pie and I will be using this recipe again when I need a quick, easy, satisfying dessert! Thanks for sharing. :)

My definition of this type dish - a 'delight' - is something really quick and easy.  I whipped this up Very quickly tonight mainly for the kids.  I used fat free , sugar free pudding and fat free cool whip. Also, i made a graham cracker crust since I did not have one in the freezer. Turned out good for a delight.  Will make again as a fast treat.

This is so delicious and so easy to make...I found the recipe and made the pie within minutes! I love that it uses staple pantry items too so you can whip it up if you find out that company is coming!

A little too sweet for me. Kids love this quick and easy pie. Make sure to followthe directions for "pie filling" on the pudding box. It comes out firmer and holds up much better than the "pudding" directions. We like slivered almonds and sprinkled on the top instead of the bottom.
