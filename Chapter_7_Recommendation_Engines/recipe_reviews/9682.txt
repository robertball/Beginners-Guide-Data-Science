These came out yummy but they were more like magic middles than sandwich cookies.  They were a little flat but still soft and chewy.

These cookies taste very good. Like one of the other raters said, they come out more like magic middles than sandwich cookies. I used an electric mixer to mix the dough, which made it very airy, and could be the reason that my cookies came out so flat. Next time I'll try mixing by hand to see if that makes a difference. They taste great, though!

These cookies are really good but you need to add some more flour to the dough. (that's what I did)
