I have to start off by saying that the flavor of the cupcakes were good, however they were the driest cupcakes that I have ever tasted or tried to eat. If you use this recipe make sure you use more oil than this one calls for. Good Luck

I've been making Carrot Cake for years!  Lovely recipe; although I added golden raisins & walnuts and halved the sugar and added Splenda to lighten it up.  Very nice with a cup of coffee in the morning.

Made 12 large and 16 mini cupcakes. Batter was dry and dense. Frosting recipe had double the amount of cream cheese and butter needed and still I had a cup of it left over.

I made this cake and I added extra oil and some water with it. After reading the reviews, I was afraid it would be too dry. I used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of water. The cake was delicious and so was the icing. I believe the icing could be cut in half, though, because there was too much of it.

The cake turned out great... But I was having a look at the other comments and and I saw that people were saying the cupcakes they made were really dry. But then I saw one comment that was so brilliant she used 1/4 cup of canola oil and 1/4 cup of water I imidiatly used the tweak and it was wonderful. I would recomend to use a different recipe for the cream cheese icing because there was way to much icing.

I just wanted to say that i was looking for a recipe like the one i use to use. And i thought this would be a close second. But i want to say that i was very disappointed with the results of the batter. Wayyyy to dry! and the ONLY reason i am giving it a 3 stars because of Kimberly Parkers' post about adding oil and water. Thank you so much! You saved my cupcakes!

Great recipe but WAY TOO MUCH icing. Definitely half that part for the amount of cupcakes this recipe makes.
So 1/2 (2) 8oz bars of butter
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 package of cream cheese
Vanilla, you can keep the same.

I saw everyone's comments that it was dry, but I have often used baby food carrots in place of normal carrots (12 ounces total). They weren't as moist as my normal carrot cake recipe, but they still had a nice consistency and tasted delicious :)

I tried this recipe and thought that it was great. Next time when I make this recipe I will add either walnuts, pecans or chocolate chips to the recipe. This recipe is easy to make and had a great flavour too.

Horrible recipe!!!! I even tried the extra oil and water like other reviews said, and they were still dry and rubbery and pale looking. They taste nothing like carrot cake I’ve had in the past...and the icing is also terrible! Definitely a huge disappointment....not the “carrot cake” that we were expecting :(

The cake was ok, but I think a definite measurement should have been specified for the carrots. 
   The frosting was horrible!!!!!!!!!   Way TOO MUCH BUTTER!!!!
There was no cream cheese flavor, it was all like butter and confectioners sugar overload.  I made these for my dad's birthday and was embarrassed to serve them.
   Also, twice as much frosting as needed.
  Meh.

Next time we make these I'm cutting the baking time to 30 minutes. We did it for about 37 minutes and they came out dry. The flavor was great and our girls devoured theirs. One change we made was adding a cup of raisins, which was a big hit with my nut-allergic wife.

I definitely recommend using paper cups instead of spray, especially if you are the impatient type and want to frost and eat before the cupcakes have cooled.

All in all, a pretty solid recipe. Directions were simple, and easy to follow. I read the comments before starting, and did a batch to the recipe, and a batch with the extra oil, and it made a huge difference - way better texture. I do have to say that I think these need a little more in the way of spice, and walnuts/some kind of nut would be a really nice addition. The icing is on the bland side, I added lemon juice to mine to kick it up a little, made a huge difference!!

I should have read the reviews before hand because they are pretty spot on. The cakes weren't so much dry as they were just bland tasting. I added almond extract to the cakes tho and subbed it out for the vanilla extract in the frosting which I'm glad I did because in the end that's what saved it for me. Although the recipe calls for plenty of sugar, I just wasn't tasting it. I candied micro carrots for a garnish and sprinkled grated nutmeg and a vanilla bean flure de sel to finish so all in all they ended up having plenty of flavor (thanks to the toppings) but next time I make carrot cake I will be using a different recipe. And yes, the frosting recipe is twice what you need(but delicious).

Thank god I read the reviews (mind you, after I already started) I was already worried that it would be too dry, based on the ingredients list. But with a helpful hint from another member I was able to save them! Tip: add the water and oil first and then beat in the eggs, the mixture was so dense before I added the water that it actually blew the motor on my electric mixer. Overall, with those tips, pretty great recipe! Happy baking! :-D

I have never made carrot cake before and gave this recipe a try (I bake all the time, so I should have gone with my gut). The flavor was very nice and mine did not come out too dry, like others have mentioned (but I could see how they could get dry and would probably up the oil/water next time). The one issue I have is how vague the amt of carrots is. "4 Large carrots". I used the suggested amt and as I was mixing, I kept saying to myself "this looks like WAY TOO MUCH carrot" and it WAS! I wish it said something more like "4 large carrots, yielding @ 2 cups" or whatever it's supposed to be. I didn't buy HUGE carrots and it yielded probably 5 cups..yikes! So I ended up with 12 cupcakes and a corning-ware size cake (but OVERWHELMINGLY Carroty). Also the icing is WAY too much, if you end up with 12 cupcakes, you only need HALF the icing. I will tweak the recipe next time, as it was easy and the flavor was nice, IF there were less carrots!
