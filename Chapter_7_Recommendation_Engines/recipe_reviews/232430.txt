Very popular at my house.  I did add two cloves of garlic, 1/2tsp of basil, and left off the pepper (my mom hates pepper).  Will be making this again.

It was ok. There was nothing horrible about it, but neither did it stand out in any way. I did like how it browned around the edges. That gave it a bit more flavor. I think it needed some thyme or sage. My daughter told me I should have used some ham or bacon in it. Bacon fixes everything. I tried to dress it up with some fresh dill for photographing, but that looks silly and it didn't help the flavor at all.

Great for a quick supper when you don't know what else to make. Pared with some kind of bread and salad it is a great meal.

This was a great recipe.  I did not have leeks, so I used onions.  Likewise I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used cottage cheese.  My secret ingredient is Herb de Provence.  It was yummy and my husband loved it.

I was disappointed with this recipe even after adding garlic and basil as another reviewer suggested. There just wasn't enough flavor and I found the leeks overpowering. However, it was my first frittata and the consistency was good so it wasn't a total fail.

I, too, added the garlic and used Alexia Onion, Garlic and White Pepper flavored shredded potatoes. -Really kicked it up a notch (to quote Emeril).

-Making it again and trying some basil in it. Perfect Friday dish during lent.

I took mer2020's advice and added garlic and basil. It was 4 stars as I prepared it, but the recipe is three stars as written.
