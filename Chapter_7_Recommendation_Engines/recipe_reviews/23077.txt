This is a good, easy recipe to use up eggplant. In an attempt to keep this low-fat, I did not add the clarified butter. I cooked the onions and tomatoes with Pam butter flavored spray, added garlic and a bit of salt. I also used much more spice than called for. Served it over brown rice and it really was tasty and very healthy. The leftovers were even better.

This is so simple, delicious and easy to make.  I didn't bake the eggplant, I just sauteed it with the onions and I used safflower oil instead of clarified butter.  I added the fresh tomatoes very close to the end of cooking and just cooked them very lightly so they gave a little texture to the dish.  I also used 5 really heaped teaspoons of cilantro seeds and ground them lightly so they were very pungent. Thank you for this recipe I'll definitely make it again.

Very yummy. I hadn't made eggplant before, so I wasn't quite sure whether to just mash the eggplant insides or to include the skin. I didn't include the skin, and it turned out yummy!

Next time will not bake eggplant but blanch and saute with onions and 1 clove minced garlic. Also added some salt and had to use ground coriander (1/2 tsp) and will add more next time too. Thought I had seeds but... Used canned tomatoes which was fine. Not impressive looks but really tasted pretty good.

Indeed simple but oh so flavorful! I used canned diced tomatoes for even more simplicity, they were fine. Served this with steamed cauliflower and whole string beans, grilled yogurt chicken and basmati rice. Will do again.

I like this recipe as a base, but it needs a lot more flavor.  I added garlic, lemon juice and garlic salt but it still needs a bit more tweaking to be really flavorful.

Had to substitute green onions and canned diced tomatoes (drained).  Also, I was too impatient for the eggplant to finish getting mushy in the oven, so I pulled it out and cut into pieces...sautee'd it all (covered).  Was delicious!  Great alternative to fried eggplant.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have to say while I was making this it looked like it was going to be terrible. But boy was I wrong! This is amazing. I did top with a little feta so the kids would eat it, but the even without feta it was great!

This is good dish, but it needs some additional ingredients to make truly "Indian" and more flavorful. You need to add salt, garam masala (if you have it) or black pepper, red chilli pepper, minced garlic, minced ginger, and turmeric powder.

Excellent flavour after tweaking from other reviews (garlic, salt, curry powder, ground coriander, etc). Baked for 15 mins at 350 and baked cherry tomatoes for the same time in lieu of canned tomatoes. Paired with brown rice. Fabulous & easy. Will make again & again.

I did NOT like this. Maybe I just don't like eggplant because this was the first time I've ever had it. But other people said it was good. :(

Not a lot of flavor.  if your looking for just a vegi side dish it would be fine.  but not an indian flavor.  I added Tandoori Masala and it gave it a little more of an indian flavor but I did not add enough to make a difference because I did not want to alter the dish too much the first time.  Not sure if I would make again.

Turned out great. Sautéed onions, mushrooms, Rotel, garlic, ginger, in olive oil and butter, added boiled and drained eggplant. Seasoned with salt, turmeric and Garam masala. Delicious!

Deceptively simple ingredient list = delicious dinner. However, I was unable to mash my eggplant--it was plenty tender, but the cut edges dried into a skin that my potato masher wasn't up to breaking through. I ended up cubing the eggplant and cooking it with the onions some more, before mashing right in the pan. Then I added the tomatoes. Watching Chopped has taught me never to feed the judges raw spices, but in this case, not true, the freshly crushed seeds were ExAcTlY what this dish needed. Also a teeny bit of salt. And I used a combo of salted butter and duck fat instead of ghee. Thanks so much for this delicious new way to prepare eggplant!

I looked at the other reviews that said that the recipe was a little too bland. So I added a little salt and garlic powder at the end. I also substituted coriander seeds with coriander powder.  It tasted a little sweet. It was good.

I tried it last night and it was OK. Although my husband loved it, I think it needs more spices to be better.
