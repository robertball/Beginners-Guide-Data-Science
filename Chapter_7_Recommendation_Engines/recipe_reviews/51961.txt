We made this recipe since my husband is Dutch and misses the food from The Netherlands.  We followed the recipe except I left out the bell pepper because by that time the salad was big enough with all the other ingredients.  It was okay tasting, but very plain.  I would add in some other colors next time as all the ingredients are green, and it looks plain.  Maybe cauliflower instead of broccoli and red pepper instead of green.  Also, the Dutch would use only mayo in their salad because they really dont' have salad dressing.  So since we like it with more I mixed the mayo with red wine vinegar, parmesan cheese, and a touch of sweetner to kick it up a notch.  My husband wasn't brough back to his home country from this meal and being so plain I do not think we would make it again.  The eggs are a nice touch though.

My husband is picky and was very skeptical about this recipe. He loves it and would eat it every night if he could. I fix it up for him as a treat at least once a week

This was a wonderful salad.  We added blueberries and tomatoes, and topped it with cheese.  I used Italian dressing, but my husband liked the mayo better.  Overall, it was fabulous.  I'd recommend it to anyone!

I liked the ingredients of this salad, but I just couldn't use mayo for the dressing. I added tomatoes and I used ranch dressing. I will make it again like that. I also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.

A different twist on using eggs in a salad. Delicious! I served this with a Lemon Asparagus chicken & rice pilaf. Thanks for the recipe.

I omitted the green bell pepper from my serving and the celery from Husband's due to personal preference. Also used lite mayo to cut back on a few cals. We thought it was much improved by a little sprinkle of extra-sharp Cheddar cheese. Good salad though. Thanks, Monica!
