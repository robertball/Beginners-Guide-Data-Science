This is my first time making oyster soup and most likely not my last. I love the flavors and the simplicity of this soup. Probably one of the best seafood soups out there. I used a 16 oz bag of frozen oysters (just thawed in bag with a bowl full of water and drained in stainer to reserve juice) other than that followed recipe as is. Just wonderful, have to taste to understand.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

This recipe was very tasty and uncomplicated to prepare. I used a dry white wine because I'm not crazy about sherry; I also used whole milk and half-n-half instead of the heavy cream, one tblsp of dried parsley (because that was what I had on hand) and garlic bread croutons....main meal with a salad....Perfect!

We loved this! I had been using a recipe out of a cookbook and decided to give this one a try.  I don't know Grandpa - but his oyster stew is fabulous! Two of us ate every last drop!  We had fresh-harvested oysters from the Eastern shore and I also added just a pinch of Old Bay for some added flavor.  We'll use this recipe from now on.

I made this for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit. We had a lot of oyster liquor, and I did not think we would use it all, but I really did end up needing it.  I added a little bit of Old Bay but I didn't want to overpower the delicate flavor so it was 
just a pinch but it really made a difference.

Love this. Oyster stew is a Christmas Eve tradition in our house too. I put a splash of worchestershire and tabasco sauce in mine.

I tried this recipe to use up the lightly cooked oysters left over from a New Year's oyster roast, and it was wonderful! I threw in a few small dried red chilis with the shallots (comparable to maybe 1/4 tsp chili flakes); that makes for a subtle addition that complements nicely. And I used abundant parsley.  What a wonderful soup for January 2!!!

I LOVED this! It had this beautiful pure ocean essence! The balance of cream and flavor was so lovely my mouth was watering after every spoonful! 
I'd like to give a big thank you to the author for sharing such a beloved family recipe with the rest of the world! Your Grandfather was a true chef!

So good!! Fresh oysters really brought out the flavor. I made the recipe as is, minus fresh parsley because we were out, but that's just a garnish anyway.  I am definitively saving this recipe to make again.

Amazing just the way it is!  My only change was a small dollop of butter on top at the time of serving and before putting on the paprika and sprinkling of parsley.  Just amazing.....thank you

1.15.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222044/grandpas-oyster-stew/ ... Really like the addition of sherry to seafood.  Simple, but on the elegant side, too.  I added a stalk of celery, minced. NOTE:  Actually made Southern Cookbook Oyster Bisque sauteing 1 slice onion, 1 stalk celery in 2T butter till soft, but not brown.  Added 12oz oysters, chopped, & liquor.  Then 3c light cream, 1/4t salt, 1/8t pepper, & 1/4c dry sherry.  Simmered about 5 minutes.  I think the AR recipe would be better - reducing (by boiling) sherry is a good idea - among other changes.

I hadn't made oyster stew in years and lost my recipe.  This was very good!  I did add a little old bay and used minced onion in place of shallots.  Will definitely make this again!

Really good!!!  I didn't rinse my oysters well enough and had some shell pieces in the bottom.  Ill rinse next time and save the liquid from the jar.  I bought a quart of them at Costco, but I'm in the northwest and we have oysters everywhere up here along the coast!!  We are so fortunate.  But the flavor is really good!!  I'm a little confused as to the 24 oysters.  What size?  They vary so much. I had extra small and about a quart of them. I added maybe another cup of milk just to make sure I had enough liquid. I also chopped up the oysters into bite size chunks. This was super easy and FAST to make.   Whipped it up in about 30 min.  I added saltines on top.

I have made this both with and without the sherry.  It really depends on your personal preference.  Either way you can't go wrong.  This is a great recipe.

I mixed some 1% milk with heavy cream for a lighter taste. Very good recipe. I would make again.

I was in charge of the oyster stew last Christmas. Traditionally my father would have done it but he was ready to pass the torch. Thankfully I came across this recipe and decided on it. It was excellent and the family made several compliments. I made sure there were plenty of oysters by using small and large varieties. The only change I made was using cilantro instead of parsley. It's a Texas thing I suppose..

Amazing good!  I used more oyster than it called for, 24 ounces, since they were smaller ones.  This will be a regular dinner for us!

Used fresh oysters, subbed 1/2 med onion for shallots, skipped parsley & paprika, added dash of Walker & Sons Hot "Slap Ya Mamma" cajun style seasoning for a little kick.  This turned out to be delicious.  I can see this becoming a classic for me.  I feel like the parsley and paprika were more for appearance than anything, but they may add extra flavor?

The flavors for this were fantastic! I didn't make any changes and loved how simple and easy this recipe is. I will definitely make it again when we don't have kids (because they aren't oyster fans).

Overall this is a quick, easy and delicious recipe. I used cream instead of half and half, and added a touch of sherry, cayenne pepper and hot sauce. I didn’t have any oyster crackers, so I broke up some stoned wheat thins, which worked well. Go easy on the salt depending on the brinyness of your oysters. I used fresh Blue Point oysters which were on the salty side, but still very meaty and delicious!

did not turn out tasty.     Perhaps it was the oysters itself from a can.

Amazing!  I added cayenne pepper to taste for a little kick and it was delicious!  For left overs: remove the oysters from the left over stew.  Heat the liquid only on simmer until hot.  Add the oysters exactly like in the recipe.  Watch carefully but done right the oysters will be as tender and delicious as when made fresh.

I made a dairy free version.  I used Rice milk in place of the milk and coconut cream in place of the heavy cream.  Instead of butter I used Ghee (use only 1/2 of what the recipe calls for the butter)  If you like it thicker you can use arrowroot mixed with a little bit of water to thicken it up.  That is preference only.
