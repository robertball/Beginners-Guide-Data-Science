I'm not sure how you are supposed to roll these as the batter is looser than regular cookies dough.  I simply used my cookie scoop as I usually do and that worked perfectly.   I pressed the cookies flat with the back of the spatula to get them to flatten and found that putting the temperature to 375 worked better for the  baking time and color.  I had used two whole eggs instead of the four egg whites because I like the body the egg yolks give the batter.

Loved it-- different texture, but very flavorful!  I used butternut squash instead of sweet potato !

Awesome recipe, though I add one more teaspoon of vanilla and use dark brown sugar.  If you like to make larger cookies as I do, this makes something closer to three instead of four dozen.
