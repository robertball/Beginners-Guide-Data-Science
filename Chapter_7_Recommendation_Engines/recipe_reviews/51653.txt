I am a Personal Chef and I have made this for a few of my clients and my family. Everyone just fell in love with it. The only change that I made to it was I added some toasted bread crumbs about 3 minutes before I took it out of the over and it added a nice crunch. One of my clients used it as a Holiday Dip for her party and it ran out in the first 30 minutes of the party!!! Hats Off To You for a Job Well Done!!

This was an outstanding crab dish, Dennis! I served it at my seafood-themed brunch and people gobbled it right up. Unsure of the spicy-index of the crowd, I cut the salt, cayenne and Cajun seasoning in half. I increased the crab to 1 1/2 pounds, as well as the eggs to 3. Didn't seem to ruin the dish at all. Next time I'm making this for my family, I will go back to your original recipe. We like it spicey!

Took this to our friday night card party and everyone loved it.  I did tweak the receipe somewhat.  Used 3 cans of crabmeat instead of the lump.  Also added 1/2 t old bay seasoning and 1/2 t garlic pepper. Instead of American Cheese, used a bag of mixed cheeses because that is what I had on hand.  And believe it or not, this tastes even better the 2nd day!  Thanks for the great recipe Dennis.  It will become a staple for our parties for sure.

As a New Orleanian there is NO WAY I could use American cheese! lol (sorry recipe writer).  I used all sharp cheddar and extra cayenne to spice it up.  I also baked it WITH the green onion instead of adding it later.

I also live in Louisiana and have used this basic recipe for years.  My family loves it!  Instead of the heavy cream I use one can of evaporated milk and I also substitute the crab meat with Imitation crabmeat on occassion.  This is only because one of my children deosn't like real crab (go figure?). Any way it is an excellent recipe.

This is a decent recipe, but a little too salty.  I would definitely make this again, but I will look for ways to cut the salt.  Omit salt in recipe, rinse seafood before prep, check sodium profile on cheese, etc.

This was sooooo good!  My husband is also from Louisiana and he just loved it as well as my daughter.  I gave 5 stars because I followed the recipe without diversion.  I agree however with other users to omit the salt, but the family already told me this is a keeper!  Thanks Dennis!

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I did add a little more cheese than required, but this is definitely the best crabmeat au gratin I have tasted/made.  I like the fact that there were no bread crumbs to dry it out.  I would highly recommend it (and have!) to anyone.  In fact, I plan to prepare this for some very picky "cooks" in our family, and am convinced they will love it as well.  It is also good as a dip with chips or crackers.

The only thing I didn't like is that it was a little too quiche-like.  Don't get me wrong though, it was absolutely delicious...I was just hoping for something creamier like the one they serve at Ralph and Kacoo's in New Orleans.  Next time I will omit the eggs.

Delicious!  The recipe was very easy to follow.  I split the mixture in half prior to baking and froze one half.  I popped the frozen portion in last night at 350 for 40 minutes and it turned out delicious the second time around as well.  I did use all American cheese (Bon Ton crab au gratin was my inspiration) and added a little sherry prior to adding the cream mixture.  This one's a keeper!

OMG!! I love this recipe.  I made it a couple of yrs ago for my husband (at the time lol) and it was just awesome.  As a catholic during lent season I look for different recipes to use for seafood fridays.  This is such a good meal.  I added shrimp and did sub the sharp cheddar for the american cheese.  But I love it!!  With Conchis Sangria and garlic bread it is great as a meal.  Thanks Dennis!!!

I was looking for a recipe to use up left over crabmeat. WOW!  This is so tasty.
Instead of using heavy cream, I used evaporated low fat milk and I used lesser amounts of salt & cheeses.  It still came out great. I love the bit of "bite" the cayenne pepper gives it. Serve with a salad and it's a complete meal. You gotta  try this.

I found this too rich, too salty for my tastes, and that was using low-fat milk instead of cream, some asagio cheese in place of American (yuk). Hubby who loves cheese ate it, wasn't impressed. Could not imagine eating it as a main dish, maybe as a bread/cracker dip. Won't be making it again.

Terrific Dennis.  I loved your casserole.  Was looking for as special crab au gratin and I think I have found it.  For those of you who are complaining about the saltiness...check the "stuff" you are using that you believe (erroneously) is "American Cheese".  It probably is "American Cheese Product" or "American Cheese Food".  Whatever Cheese Product or Cheese Food is, it ain't American Cheese.  It is a very salty imitation food substance that is not even considered food at all.  It probably has a brand name on the label, and you thought it was a real cheese.  Use real american cheese.  It is not salty and will not add salt to your recipes.

I never add stock seasonings to my dishes so I didn't add the creole seasoning. I also followed what everyone said and get rid of the salt. After preparing and adding the crab meat, I tasted it and it was missing tons of salt. I added salt to it and extra Cayenne pepper and black pepper. I don't recomend at all to add extra salt, just that was my personal experience with it. After cooked it came out really good. I gave it 5 stars because my brother, who is a cook, really liked it and so did my fiance.

Do yourself a favor and OMIT the salt! Use a salt shaker at the table if you need salt.  Based on other reviews, I cut the amount in half, but it still overpowered the dish.  Minus the salt, this would be a good crab au gratin. It has a really nice texture and a nice cajun flavor.

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly.  Served it with crackers to friends at a small get together, not a huge hit, but well received.  This is a very rich dish so a little goes a long way.

Uhhh.  If you like a LOT of cheese flavor, this is for you.  I loved the spicy flavor but felt all the cheese was just too overwhelming. I did substitute shrimp for crab, but this change didn't effect the prominence of the cheese. I suppose I would make this again, but maybe as a side dish rather than the main thing.  It's quite easy to make but does take some better than average time.  One note - my 9 X 9 dish was only filled 1/2 way to the top.  It's just as well, because this dish is so rich, I could only eat a little bit anyway.

My five-star rating has to be qualified: I'm giving this recipe five stars AS A DIP, not an entree. It is far too rich to eat a serving as a main course! But that's not a complaint; it's delicious! It was a huge hit and we'll have it again. My alterations were as follows: increased the creole seasoning to 1 1/2 tsps, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp, used all sharp cheddar and baked most of the green onions in the dish, reserving a smaller amount for the topping. Fantastic!

This is the second time I made this dish (first time was about two years ago) and it's as great as I remembered it. Very rich and delicious. I don't like American cheese so I used 1 cup of Cheddar in the dish and one cup on top after baking. I may add the green onions in the mix next time or leave them off. I felt they subtracted from the overall excellence of the casserole. Will be making this again and again. Thanks!

I am from New Orleans and was looking for a a recipe for crabmeat au gratin for my picky husband. He LOVED this recipe with the exception that for someone who loves salt thought it was EXTREMELY salty. Next time I will omit the salt all together. Other than that it had very good flavor.

I found this a bit bland.  If I make it again I'll add more cajun seasonings and some black pepper.

Delicious but time consuming.  That is why I only gave it four stars.  Be sure you use premium quality crabmeat and go light on the salt, because the cajun seasoning is quite salty.  My husband thought this was one of the best Crabmeat Au Gratin dishes he has eaten.

As a few people recommended, I omitted the salt, but increased the Creole seasoning to 2 tsps, cayenne to 1 tsp, and added 1 tsp white pepper. I only used approx 1/4 cup of onion, and used all sharp cheddar for the cheeses. A-one, top-notch, and quickly disappeared as an appetizer served w/crackers, bread and crudites. Yummm!

I love this recipe and so does my family!  The only thing I changed was adding more crabmeat!  My husband doesn't really like "fish" but he's asked for thirds every time I've made it.  I use the imitation crab meat, I think it has a sweeter flavour.

Excellent dish!  Definitely a splurge meal, high in fat and calories - but that's why it's so good!  I would serve this to company.  Family loved the dish. Just so good.  We had it for dinner, but it would be great for brunch or a weekend lunch.  Did I mention I liked it?  

I did have to make 2 modifications, but I do not believe it changed the recipe. Used 2% cheddar cheese because it is what I had on hand, and I was out of cream so I fudged by melting butter into skim milk.  We watch our salt, so I use unsalted butter and decreased the amount of salt in the recipe.  

Thanks for the recipe!

Not good.  Not your traditional Crabmeat Au Gratin.  I am a native of New Orleans and trust me, this does not come close. I'm only giving it a star because the system is forcing me to, but it is not desrving of a star.  Don't waste your time or your crab meat.  Sorry if this sounds cold, but I'm only being honest.

I really didnt care for this at all, all the cheese made it too greasy, and I agree with others it was also too salty. I would have liked for it to be more of a creamier blend with the cheese.  On the look out for a better Crabmeat Au Gratin recipe.

This was very good.  Due to other reviews I did cut back on the salt but it was still too salty. I'm drinking water like crazy.  
I used skim milk rather than the cream with no noticeable difference to consistency.
I cut back on the cayenne but would cut it back a bit further.  I don't use American cheese in my cooking - I used all cheddar.  
Sounds like a lot of changes to justify 4 stars but we really enjoyed it all the same.  We'd just enjoy it more so with the amendments - and I will make it again.

It's a pretty good recipe. I would recommend minced garlic in place of garlic powder. You can also make this with imitation crab, shrimp, crawfish, or any other seafood you wish.  Putting it under a broiler for 90 seconds will give the peaks some browning.  It is extremely rich, so you may want to serve it with some lighter sides.

This is a crowd pleaser. Everyone loves this dip! The first time I made it, I found it to be really salty, so now I leave out the 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I also use about 3 or 4 cloves of chopped garlic in place of the garlic powder and I use only sharp cheddar cheese (no American cheese). And I add more celery - about 3 stalks. I serve it with toasted baguette slices. It's so good!!

My favorite food on the planet and it lives up to its name. I couldn’t do American cheese, though, since I’m from Louisiana, but sharp cheddar works perfectly (as with tradition). I added extra cheese and used unsalted butter. Be careful of your choice of creole seasoning, though. They usually have lots of salt and can be too salty (even for a Louisianian).

Follow the previous reviews and omitted the salt.  Used the Mexican shredded mix, because it was what I had at the time.  The only other changed is that I used olive oil instead of the butter to cook the veggies, it's just my personal preference.  It was delicious, my husband got seconds, definitely a repeat.  Served it over white rice, bread, and a salad.

Really good, I agree it's a bit salty. Used a mix of sharp cheddar, quesadilla cheese and grand cru. Had them on hand, worked really well. Definitely will make again, cutting salt, adding Frank's red hot or Tabasco sauce and more onion/celery than it calls for.   My niece suggested adding noodles, seems like it would easily convert to a crab Mac n cheese dish.

I left out the cayenne pepper and added more Bay's seasoning.  We ate it plain, but thought it would be wonderful over a piece of toasted sourdough.

Love this! Only thing that hurt my soul was it calling for American. USE SHARP CHEDDAR! I also put the green onions into it not on top. SO GOOD!

This is absolutely a wonderful dish, very rich.  The only changes I made was to add some dried mustard and sprinkled old bay on the top and added some seasoned bread crumbs.  5 stars.  Thank you Dennis for sharing this recipe.

This dish was too rich and salty. I do plan on making it again to see if I can improve upon the recipe just because I love crab. Oh and instead of using regular flour I used coconut flour instead. Next time more onions more celery, more spice but no salt and probably just a pinch of creole seasoning. And I ll probably crack some crabs myself instead of buying that package stuff which was real crab but it just tasted different.

Nice!  The procedure was well explained.  I subbed evaporated milk whisked with the egg yolks and some Tony's for the salt and spices.

Fantastic! I changed nothing. My wife and I enjoyed this just as much as crab imperial.

I followed your recipe except I omitted the salt because the Tony Chachere is pretty much all the salt I want, used a finely chopped jalapeño and rice flour. It just came out of the oven, the wait is over.... and WOW!!! Merçi! Fantastique! This would make a great stuffing for merlitons, too.

I tried this recipe for my daughter's birthday and it was a BIG hit. Cheesy and easy to make! I did cut back on the salt.

This is so good, you should not make this if you have no willpower. We could not stay away from the leftovers the night we cooked this. AWESOME!
