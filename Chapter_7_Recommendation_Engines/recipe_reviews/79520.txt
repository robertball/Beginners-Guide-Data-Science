Loved this! I'm going to have a hard time going back to plain ol tomato soup, espcially because this was so easy to make. I had all the ingredients on hand, served it with grilled provolone sandwiches. I had half an onion on hand so I chopped that up with the garlic and sauteed them in a little butter, then added them to the soup.  The flavor was fantastic!

This was excellent. I made it for the first time today for lunch/dinner. I do recommend using just half of the recommended amount of cheese. Two thumbs up! I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I did doctor it up a bit though by combining several recipes from this site. I used fresh basil, used fresh tomatoes (boiled with onion, garlic, oregano) and used cream cheese instead of milk to make the soup creamier. The gorgonzola complimented the flavors wonderfully and my hubby who normally does not like gorgonzola loved this soup!

This soup tastes like anything other than one out of a can...it's really delicious and tastes homemade.  Don't rush the simmering on this, as you need to give the soup a chance for the cheese to melt and flavors to blend.  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of substituting blue cheese for the gorgonzola (it's what was in the fridge).  FYI, I found the 26-oz can of soup at WalMart.

So very delicious!  What I did: 2 x 11 oz cans Campbell's tomato bisque soup; 2 x 14.5 oz cans S&W diced tomatoes; 12 oz can 2% evaporated milk; 3 garlic cloves, minced; 5.5 oz crumbled Gorgonzola cheese; 1 tbsp onion powder; 1 tbsp garlic powder; 1 tsp ground black pepper, 10 leaves fresh basil, chopped, and added after I removed the soup from the heat.  We ate this with a grilled four-cheese (cheddar, smoked gouda, mozzarella, and provolone) sandwich, and it was absolutely awesome!  My husband and I rate any new recipes from one to ten, and we rate very few things above an eight...this soup was a nine + for both of us.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.

I didn't have a full 2 tablespoons of minced garlic so I added a bit of garlic powder - otherwise made as described and it was incredible!  I made it again the next night!

Great spin on regular old tomato soup.  I make it when I've got blue cheese to use up.

Really tasty soup!  The tomato soup I had on hand wasn't real thick or creamy, so I eliminated the water and one can of tomatoes.  Still fabulous and can't wait to try again with creamier tomato soup.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was YUMMY!  I wasn't sure because it was so easy and not all from scratch (the canned tomato soup).  I just had my first serving and, by the end, I was say ummmmm and licking the bowl.  Can't wait to have more!  SOmetimes I think tomato soup is boring but the diced tomatoes make this extra filling.

Made as is, but did a total of 1 cup water and 1 and 1/2 cups milk, based on preference.  Great soup! My boyfriend said it was the best tomato soup he had ever had.  Thanks for the recipe, Michelle!

Unfortunately, I was not a fan of this soup at all.  I added fresh basil and sauteed some onions and thought it had enough other ingredients that would disguise the "canned tomato soup" flavor.  It did not.  I absolutely love gorgonzola soup but this was much too tangy for me.

This was fantastic! I used a lot more gorgonzola, of course. Easy, delicious, and makes enough for leftovers. I have made it several times.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I made it following the recipe, except I used chopped garlic instead of minced.  I was expecting  a strong gorgonzola flavor, but it was totally blended in with the other flavors.  Quick, simple, but tastes out of this world.

This is a rich, hearty and yummy soup that is very easy to prepare.  But beware...the gorgonzola is fairly strong.  You will definitely taste this and if you don't like strong cheese, this might not be for you.

This was really good!  Only had a small can of tomato soup so scaled it down to 3 servings.  I really enjoyed it!  Might try it by using rotel tomatoes next time for a change.  Will definitely make again!

I just couldn't bring myself to use a can of soup so I used a 26 ounce can of crushed tomatoes.  I added diced tomatoes with jalapenos since we like things to have a bit of a kick.  It's not quite time for dinner but I did taste it and it's delicious.  I also used fresh basil which I think makes a huge difference in the flavor.

This was super easy to make.  I am still not sure that I liked the chunky style but the taste was good.  I am going to try it next time and emulsify the soup before serving.  Stay tuned

Quick and flavorful. I was worried while it was cooking because it smelled like marinara sauce, but the end result was pure tasty soup.

The gorgonzola cheese is strong so not so much a tomato soup. I had to put mine in the blender to make a smooth soup, but I did enjoy the flavor.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated and found it very tasty and a new twist on Tomato soup.  Great with Grilled Cheddar sandwiches for a hearty meal.

This was really nice and creamy. Family didn't like the diced tomatoes as much as I did so I will leave that out of their bowls the next time.  I too used minced onions with just a dash of the onion powder. The tomato soup that I used already had basil and I used the dry basil sparingly. Everything else I left as per the recipe.

My new favorite tomato soup! The only changes I made were a slightly smaller can of soup ( 23 oz. can was the largest my store carries), and I used half N half (needed to use it up). Next time I might go for a more French twist; regular diced tomatoes, herbs de Provence and goat cheese.

Quick and easy and so much better than soup out of a can! And if you don't care for Gorgonzola, add your favorite cheese. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will make it again!

Very good! I wasn't sure how I'd like it with the gorgonzola cheese in it, so I just topped the soup with some, and the flavors do work well with the soup. I wanted to use what I had on hand, so I went with 1 can of tomato bisque soup and 1 can of tomato soup. Also used 2 fresh tomatoes chopped, 1 can of diced petite tomatoes, extra water (due to using the fresh tomatoes), and added 1 bay leaf and 1/4 cup of white wine. I used evaporated milk and added a tsp or so of brown sugar to cut the acidity. I would maybe try adding a sauteed onion the next time. It's good chunky, but I think I may like it better if it was pureed. UPDATE 10/16: I pureed it and liked it a lot better! Also, it's called 'Cream of Tomato', so I preferred the creaminess after pureeing. Left out the cheese and still very good!

I made this recipe tonight.  I slightly modified.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, 2 10oz cans tomatoes soup, 1 10oz tomatoes bisque.  1 12oz can FF evaporated milk, no water.  Oh, and Blue Cheese as what I had, and we like it.  Hubby loved it!

I was a bit leery of this recipe since it was basically a mix of canned ingredients, but the gorgonzola had me intrigued. This soup is so yummy, and perfect for busy weeknights. I typically double the recipe and take leftovers to work with me the next day.

I can't say I followed this completely because I had to make the tomato soup base...I had tomato paste/juice from the garden last summer.  I sauteed a diced onion in 2 T. butter and added 2 T. flour to that then added it to the tomato juice. Used an immersion blender to smooth the onion.  After thickening I followed this recipe  (omitting a can of tomatoes) then followed the seasonings.  At the end, to meet our tastes, I added a little wine, a little sugar, and some half and half.  I write this review to say I loved how the cheese melted in and created this wonderful tomato basil soup.

We loved this recipe. Our household like more of a smooth texture in tomato soup, so I just swapped out the diced tomatoes for crushed tomatoes and it was delicious.

I make this soup.   I will definitely make again.  I did a few things different I saute onion, garlic, and red bell pepper in olive oil.   I used a half of cup of half/half to thicken it .  I used fresh basil, blue cheese, and croutons to garnish.  A grilled ham and cheese sandwich on the side.

Didn't have basil so I used a mixed blend of providence herbs. Also used a bit more garlic sautéed with some onions. I love Gorgonzola and would possibly use more next time. I simmered for closer to 40 minutes to let the cheese and flavors ruminate. It was a bit more watery than I would have liked.. Next time I'll use less water I think. Overall delicious!

Really delicious. I couldn't even tell I was eating canned soup! I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream, and that really made it creamy and good.

This is a nice base. I used 28oz can tomato puree and 28oz can crushed tomatoes;I replaced milk with almond milk; added sugar, black pepper, salt. I used the basil, onion powder, garlic, cheese, and liquid in the given amounts, and let it sit for several hours. Good stuff.

It's fantastic! Made it with fresh tomato juice (I mixed tomatoes in the blender) and diced fresh tomatoes! Because of that I added no water and used condensed milk! Used fresh onions, garlic and basil, also added dried oregano, pepper and a pin of sugar! Very creamy!

This soup was great!  It went nicely with a salad and fresh bread for a simple summer dinner. The only change I made was reducing the milk to 1/2 cup because we like our soup a bit thicker.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definately make this again.
