Looking for something new to bring to our weekly family lunches, I stumbled upon this interesting looking recipe. All I can say is that it was easy to make (although a bit time consuming), and a huge hit!!! Everyone FLIPPED for the bean salad and it flew off the table.  Now this item is a must have.  Its light and great for the summer. To make the salad more colorful, I used all different kinds of beans instead of just garbanzos. Enjoy!

its very similar to a Indian recipe,you can heat some oil, let the Cumins and some black mustard seeds splutter along with some finely chopped onions till it browns, just add the peas, add salt and a pinch of red chilli powder. Garnish with cilantro, chopped tomatoes, green chilles and may be some grated coconut.

This was just amazing.  I adapted it as follows: (1) Halved the recipe; (2) Did not use onion; (3) Added an extra splash of lemon juice and vinegar (and used cider vinegar; didn't have white-wine); (4) 1/4 heaping teaspoon of ground ginger (didn't have fresh), a little extra cumin, and only a pinch of cayenne; (5) substituted one can of chickpeas for a can of rinsed black beans - was low on chickpeas; and finally (6) added some sliced meaty green olives, marinated in olive oil only, from an Armenian store.  Really fabulous salad!

Tasty as a wrap in an iceberg lettuce leaf.  Cucumber added crunch and roasted red pepper added color.  Red wine vinegar in the dressing gave a nice flavor and also added a hint of color.

This recipe is terrific.  I didn't  have all the ingredients, so I improvised with balsamic vinegar, ground cumin, fresh coriander, diced spanish onion and green pepper and hot sauce. It was delicious.  My boyfriend loved it, even though he hates all the ingredients individually...I just didn't tell me what was in the salad! lol

This recipe is very similar to what my friend from India makes.  She doesn't use a recipe and just throws things in a bowl so it is hard for me to get recipes from her.  I did use both red and yellow peppers (for added color) and halved the recipe but other than that I followed the recipe to a "T".  My friend also makes this same recipe using canned corn in place of the chickpeas.  She always has something interesting and new and I always look forward to eating at her house!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make again and again.

This was surprisingly bland, I'm sorry to say. With the interesting ingredients, I expected it to be very flavorful, but I could really only taste the garlic. To be fair, I only marinated it for 1.5 hours, but I've had other chickpea dishes that marinated for less time and were more flavorful. Maybe with more time, this dish would be better, but I don't plan to make it again.

I made this just as written yesterday and it was just what the doctor ordered! It was light and perfect with a simple green salad. The dressing was great! A keeper for a cold night when I don't want to cook but want a little warm spice in my meal.

I really enjoyed this salad. It was easy to make and flavorful. I toasted cumin seeds in the olive oil as a previous reviewer suggested. I used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper because I couldn't find my bottle of cayenne. It was still a little spicy, but I like spicy. I only made a little bit (one can of garbanzo beans) so there is nothing left for my husband. I will make it again!

Yummy! Added a little bit of salt, to taste, some freshly ground black pepper, and cut WAY back on the olive oil - 2 TB was definitely sufficient.

I threw in 1 teaspoonful of ground coriander with this, but nothing else extra. When I took it to work everyone commented on how awesome it smelled. One of my coworkers thought it smelled good but wouldn't eat it because she said she hated garbanzo beans.  After watching me munch for quite a while I convinced her to try it.  She couldn't stop eating it!  I brought extra for her the next day so I could have mine!

I really liked this - left out the bell pepper and added a bunch of diced fresh tomatoes instead. Next time I will also add some feta cheese. Also used fresh basil instead of cilantro. Loved the fresh taste the ginger creates :)

This quickly became a favorite in our house.  Love it just the way it is written but it is also easy to mix up when you are missing some ingredients (parsley for cilantro, red onion for green, etc).

Yum! I only had three cans of chick peas, so the flavours were more intense, but not overwhelming. Also, I didn't have green onions. They would have added nice bite, but again, the recipe survives without them. I reduced the cayenne by half because I don't like things too hot. Will definitely make this again.

Great simple recipe.  Love this!  I make a smaller version, and usually at the last minute and it still tastes great no need to let sit.
*update 12-13-18* 
Tastes have changed over the years and I leave out the peppers, only adding tiny diced tomato with cilantro and dressing. Delicious!

Recipe was great, but even better when mixed with PJ's Fresh Corn Salad.  The crunch of the corn and peppers along with the garbanzo beans was a very nice blending of flavors and textures.

I tried the recipe as shown, it was okay as prepared according to the recipe, but as other commenters said, it needs some tweaking.
