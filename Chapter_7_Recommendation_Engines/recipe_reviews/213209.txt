I made this recipe just as written and we loved it!  This would be great on garlic bread.  I think next time I make it I will put in a couple of cloves of garlic with the mushrooms while they cook.  Thank for a delicious and unique recipe!!

Well, I liked this quite a bit.  I didn't use any onion, and I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and fresh parsley rather than dried.  Cooked mushrooms until they had lost their juices and were starting to brown, then added about 3 cups of spinach along with the other ingredients.  Used reduced-fat cheddar cheese and light sour cream.  Processed the mixture briefly to get a more uniform chop.  Held dip in the refrigerator about 4 hours before baking...husband waited to tell me AFTER I'd put it together that he's not all that fond of mushrooms (8 years married, and he can still surprise me!), but I liked it, and my company liked it.  I'd make it again, but I think I'd use a different cheese...Gruyere or Swiss would probably be excellent.  Thanks for a keeper!

Made this as directed .  Was very greasy ,  due to the amount of butter ,  and the cheese .  The taste of the mushrooms ,  and spices were just o.k. ,  and think it would have been better if fresh were used ,  instead of dried .  This was very mediocre for us ,  and would not make as directed again .  Maybe with less butter ,  and fresh herbs  and spices .  Sorry for the bad review .  Thanks for sharing .

I followed this recipe exactly and although it was pretty tasty, it was also really watery due to all the mushrooms.  We actually ended up straining the water when storing the leftovers and it was much better today when heated up.  It definitely wasn't my favorite dip though, so I will probably not make it again.

This was quite good! I used low fat sour cream and way less butter and it was fine. I tried to be fancy with the cheese, but I think the asked for Cheddar would have been better.

I just recently made this for a large group of people so I doubled the recipe. It was a huge hit with everyone. We all really liked it. It was quite yummy! I will make this one again. Thank-you!

this was just as greasy as another cook posted. It needs a binder or something. Flavor wasn't too bad but presentations awful.

This recipe is a party favorite. I substitute regular sour cream for “sour cream and chives” and add artichoke.  The additions give the dip a nice flavor pop. Highly recommend!

I had my doubts when I was preparing this, but it was delicious! I doubled the recipe but only used 1/4 cup butter and drained the mushroom/onion/spinach mixture before adding cheese. I also used only 1 cup of sour cream (even tho I doubled all other ingredients) as it looked way soupy with just that amount.  I also goofed and threw almost all of the last addition of cheese in and mixed it instead of putting it on top! But, I thing doing so got rid of the soupiness. Very tasty! Could taste the mushrooms even with all that cheese. Will make again!

Loved this recipe.  Very easy to make and true mushroom flavor.  I doubled the recipe and took it for a Christmas Eve appetizer.  Served with bagel chips, pita chips and onion crackers.  Was a big hit, definitely will make again.

I doubled the recipe, except for the sour cream, it only seemed to need one cup. After heating it in the oven the cheese on top turned rubbery. I just stirred it in and let it melt when I reheated it. I think it would be great without the cheese on top. So great on roast beef or toasted French bread rounds. It's even better a day or two later!

I left out the butter and just sauted onion and mushrooms in sprayed skilled until most of the liquid evaporated then followed the rest of the directions using fat free sour cream and velveta shreds except left the extra cheese off the top.  Served with tortilla chips.  Creamy and mushroomy goodness.

Delicious! Eating it right now. I used dehydrated onions (like French Onion soup mix) and a little extra cheese. SO yummy. Will be making this again at Christmas.
