My family is out of cash and we have canned tuna specially for these hard times, so making this recipe was perfect.  It took 30 minutes to make from start to finish along with cooking baked potatoes.  Everyone absolutely loved this recipe and the cost is so low even paupers like me can live like kings. (stomach-wise) hehe

Seriously, this is a lightning fast, budget friendly and super yummy recipe.. it is also very forgiving when you dont have all the ingredients.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I have made tuna patties in the past and this recipe had the best flavor and consistency...similar to crab cakes.  I added a bit more bread crumbs...about 3/4 cup total and served it with some southwestern flavored sour cream dip, but tartar would be good.  I also made these on my George Foreman grill.  Just spray the grill with oil spray and cook about four minutes.  No need to flip or anything.  Highly recommend.

Recipe pretty good as is, but next time, I will make the following changes: use regular bread crumbs--not Italian flavored. The oregano was overpowering. Also, use green onion and not regular. I think celery salt can be used for celery, and like other reviewers, I left out the dill all together. I added cajun seasoning, and although it was spicy, we loved it. I will definitely make these again with the above listed alterations.

I was suprisingly pleased with this recipe, the burgers were easy and delicious.  However, my suspicions were correct, one can of tuna will not make four burgers.

These tuna burgers are excellent. I made the "salsa" (onions/celery/bell pepper/chili sauce, spices) a day in advance. I also microwaved it for a short time; I didn't want the veggies to be too crunchy. I agree that refrigerating the patties helps them stay together when they are being pan fried. I will definitely make these again.

I'm always trying to find new recipes during lent, and I know I found a keeper this time.  Yum!  I made these twice.  The first time they came out very soggy, but with good flavor.  The second time I increased to bread crumbs to 3/4c and that seemed to help.  Also deleted the bell peppers and increased the hot pepper.

Very good.  Interestingly enough, I found that they blend perfectly with a side dish of Bush's BBQ flavor baked beans.

These were excellent.  My husband and I enjoyed them so much that we had them twice this week!  I grated some carrot to put in, and next time, I think I will add some frozen niblet corn (we love the cruch of corn in turkey burgers too!).

I didn't have chili sauce, so I put in a bunch of chili powder and lots of RedHot sauce.  They were great!  Even better cold the next day!

I've been using allrecipes for a few years now, but never opened an account until just now to review this delicious recipe.   Being Lent, I had my doubts that any non-meat burger would be tasteless and just wouldn't compare to the real thing. Though I find this particular recipe more similar to a crab cake rather than an actual burger, it is still one of the most delicious thing that I can say has come out of my kitchen.   The patty was moist, packed with flavor, cooks at super speed, easy to make (one bowl, one pan, one fork, one spatula), and is just overall comparable to the much more expensive cousin, the crab cake. I eliminated the red bell pepper (because I didn't have any), and eliminated the chili sauce, hot pepper sauce, and burger fix-ins. I also used albacore tuna (I can't imagine this this being super fantastic if the chunk light tuna was being used), which can be found in huge packs at Costco, or any other wholesale store.   When I was cutting up the onion and celery, I had my doubts. I usually do not appreciate crunchy vegetables inside cooked food because of textural differences. However, for the few minutes it took to cook the patty, the vegetables turned out PERFECTLY. Not too crunchy, not too soggy.   I made some for my mom, who is my toughest critic, and she LOVED them! I am so grateful that I was given another reason to use those cans in the back of my cabinet other than to make bland tuna sandwiches! I will definitely be making these often.

I can't believe I waited I think over two years to make this recipe. Now I can't stop making it. I am always looking for another chance to make this now! I did alter it to my tastes and what I happen to have on hand at the moment: no dill, no celery, no chili sauce, add old bay. Also, lots of people recommend adding extra bread crumbs... DON'T!  Add extra tuna. These are tuna burgers, not tuna cakes. I usually make 3 cans of chunk light tuna with 2x the rest of the ingredients and about 1.5x bread crumbs, or just enough to make them pasty (I get 6 - 7 patties). They should be like the recipe says: delicate. The extra bread makes them tough, dry and bland.

These burgers were pretty good.  My family really enjoyed them.  I omitted the red bell peppers and celery because I didn't have any, but still tasted fine.  Oh, I didn't really care for the dill weed so next time I make these I will not use it.

These were so good that DH actually said that I could add this to the rotation!  I did make a few adjustments, though.  No celery on hand, so I added a dash of celery salt.  I used 2 cans of albacore tuna and had to add a little more bread crumbs to the mixture.  I didn't have any chili sauce, so I added a dash of cayenne pepper.  I accidentally left out the dill, too.   Before sauteeing the patties in butter and olive oil, I dipped them in plain bread crumbs that I seasoned with cracked pepper and a dash of cayenne.  We ate the patties without the buns and "burger" fixings and I served sauteed zucchini with it.  THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL BASIS FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE!! This tuna filling would make wonderful tuna melts, too!!!

Not something I minded having, but not something I'll look forward to having again.  I didn't add the red pepper, dill or egg; used plain breadcrumbs.  Only doubled the tuna amount - 12oz can solidwhite tuna.  (That's where the issues with moisture come in.  You have to use the solid white.  You'll get more tuna per can, too.)  Instead of the refrigerator, put them in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes.  They won't freeze, but will firm up.

One thing I haven't seen is anyone recommending the usage of Panko Bread Crumbs. I suggest replacing half of the stated bread crumbs with Panko, forming the patties, letting them sit for 30 min to 1 hr and then patting them with Panko before frying.

For the reviewers that find this mix to be too "mushy", first please remember that this is tuna in a can that has sat in water and salt or oil for months ( or years! ) prior to your opening the can. Canned tuna, in general, is mushy. One way around this, is to "Smush" the patties down to 1/4 or even 1/8 of an inch. With patties being this thin, they cook very quickly. I suggest cooking up two and laying a piece of cheese between! 

Another use for this recipe, which could be fun, is to roll the mixture into small balls, like meatballs, cool them, and then roll them in either Panko and skillet fry or bake, or to dip them in egg and flour and fry them ( like in a Fry Daddy ). The small balls make them really kid friendly and they can be stored up and used a hundred different ways... topping for salads, tuna subs, macaroni and cheese add-ins. Be creative! (PS: Omit the dill and add 1/3 C BBQ for a southwestern flare!)

Love tuna burgers!! I omit the dill, sub green bell peppers for the celery and red peppers, and use plain bread crumbs. I found that slipping an empty tuna can into a ziploc baggy makes the burger shaping easy and less messy.

These were great!  I made a few minor changes to suit our tastes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Over the years I've discovered tuna patties need both egg AND mayonnaise for texture, taste and moisture.  I had no problem at all with them falling apart.  Chiling for 30 minutes usually takes care of that.  This one's a keeper and I will be serving these again.

Loved this recipe, my husband loves burgers especailly salmon burgers so i gave this a try and what a success! We have very sensitive eaters in our family so i made a few modifications: brown rice bread crumbs for our gluten intolerant eater, added 3 egg whites, 1 tbsp lime juice, about a tsp lemon zest and a tsp ground fresh ginger for our cholesterol watching spicy food intolerant eater and eliminated the mayo and the chili sauce and peppers. Will definitely make again!!!

Ok as another reviewer said, this recipe is so forgiving if you're missing stuff.  I used celery salt instead of celery and skipped the extra salt.  I didn't have the hot pepper sauce or the chili sauce so I added a bit of lime juce and some cajun seasoning.  And i forgot to mix in the worcestershire so I just drizzled as I cooked.  My husband promised me a weeks worth of dish duty if I'd make this again real soon!!!  I served it with a spicy dill mayo that I found on this site.  WAAAY good.

Very tasty! I used regular bread crumbs and added some basil to the mix. I also skipped the chili sauce and dill and added a bit of dijon.
It is a very soft mixture. I recommend coating the patties with cornmeal and refridgerating them before cooking. I cooked them on a George Foreman grill, which worked very well.

I reviewed this a few years ago using substituted ingredients and thought it was great.  I finally got around to making it as written and it is even better!  I too had no idea what Chili sauce was, but found it in the ketchup aisle...made by Heinz. It tastes like a jazzed up ketchup to me...a bit tangy/spicy but not at all "hot".  It is kid friendly...and I think you might be able to sub plain old ketchup in its place.  I make them with low fat mayo, egg substitute, and form the patties earlier in the day so they can firm up in the fridge until I'm ready to cook.  If you are worried about getting them cooked all the way, try making 5 thinner patties instead.  Cook them gently and I think you'll appreciate this recipe.

Different and good. Spicy little kick. Refrigeration and a light touch will keep the patties together just fine without extra bread crumbs. Nice change from regular burgers and regular tuna!

these are really tasty. my only comment is that after cooking, they were still kinda mushy. I got a nice crisp on the outside, but i'd like it if the inside felt a bit more cooked; maybe i did something wrong? Next time i'm going to try baking them

These were okay but my BF said they lacked a little zing and I agreed. I think they would have actually been better without the bun so you could taste the ingredients better. I will probably make them again, but plan doubling the recipe, no buns, add some cayenne pepper, and cheese to top them off.

I love these because they are quick and easy to make! Perfect for a weeknight when you don't have much time. I used white tuna and skipped the bell pepper and used celery seed instead of celery. Also, my husband and I liked topping it with some thousand island dressing.

I have had extra cans of tuna in my pantry for months now as I had gotten tired of tuna salad sandwiches. I'm SO glad I came upon this recipe. I love the flavors! I did not have chili paste, so I added a dew dashes of chili powder. I used fresh basil instead of dill. The only downside is that it still fell apart when I tried to transfer it to a bun, but burgers are napkin friendly food anyway.

I made myself one of these for dinner and it was better than the real burger I made for my husband.  YUM!  I also made some quick tartar sauce for my toasted bun.  This is a keeper.

I loved the taste, however was very liquidly. I added a cup more of fresh bread crumbs to absorb the juices, and refrigerated overnight. When I formed the patties, they were more like a runny dough. But, I fried them at least ten minutes, and was careful not to "flip" them in the pan until they were set. Fefinitely needed the mayo, tomato and lettuce! Added strips of crispy bacon to the "burger" and that helped with the bland texture. Could also be served with chipotle sauce for more flavor. Will make again once I figure out to eliminate some of the liquids. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I make these quite often. They are delicious and somewhat addictive. Make ahead of time and chill in the refrigerator and they won't fall apart. With our younger kids we serve without the bun and they love them. I highly recommend this!

I have been making these for a while and they are awesome. I do add more chili sauce but, that is for my own taste.  They are also good made in to small balls and deep fried as an appetizer served with white sauce on the side. In this scenario, I add more bread crumbs so, they are not too delicate to go in the the deep fryer. Just another way to serve them. Oh, and to make these a little less delicate, in the ball form or pattie form, it is helpful to put breadcrumbs on the outside. Just fill a plate and turn the patties on to the breadcrumbs, both sides. Or, roll the balls in breadcrumbs. It works! Good job in posting this delicious recipe.  Thanks!!

These are delicious, although I substituted some shredded cheddar cheese for the mayo & chili sauce so I could make a modified tuna melt.  Also, to reduce the carbs, I used crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs.  (You don't taste them & they act just like bread crumbs but without all the carbs.)  And I served my burgers between 2 crisp Romaine lettuce leaves for a low-calorie, low-carb alternative to hamburger buns.

Ours turned out fine. We think we cooked them with the heat too high, so they were not very firm and couldn't really bite into them. Make sure you make them thin enough or cook them long enough if you give this a try.

This is scrumtious!  I've never made anything like this, and I think it's a great idea.  I tripled the amount of bread crumbs called for, and they stayed together really well.  Great with lemon juice or Thousand Island dressing.

These were very good. I added 3/4 cup bread crumbs and they did not fall apart. My daughter did not enjoy them, but it will probably take a couple of more tries. This will made many more times.

These are wonderful!  I did make a few changes since I didn't have all ingredients on hand.  I made this without the red bell peppers, celery and worcestershire sauce. Since I was making it for my children, I reduced the chili sauce to 1 T, as it can be pretty spicey.  Yummy!

The  KEY STEP is in using WHITE CHUNK to have no moisture/wetness problems. I used 2 cans (6 oz or 170 gms) . We didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so used PANKO Japanese style bread crumbs. Increased the mayo to 1/2 cup. Mashed all the tuna up separately before adding all the other ingredients and used the back of a wooden spoon to press down the mix until it was really firm. Put it in the fridge for 30 minutes as suggested and then followed the recipe's instructions. the burgers stayed firm, were easy to turn over and came out A-1.  Really tasty. My wife said "that's a keeper". She had hers without the bun and remarked that one could if wished serve them like that with a a side dish (such as garlic shrimp, a veggie  and salad

Enjoyed this recipe very much!  Generally  don't follow recipes to the T... Only adjustment  was adding two cans of tuna.  Mine were seven oz.  I got 3 large burger size tuna patties.. not sure how 4 patties can come from one can.  Add more a tad more of spices than called for. Will Make This RECIPES again.  Also fried in EVO and Lemon EVO.

My fiance and I were both very surprised at how delicious this tasted! We both aren't the biggest fans of tuna so we were a bit hesitant, but it has now become one of our regular dishes. I like to double the recipe to make 4 big patties and make my own tartar sauce with greek yogurt--Perfect combination. As others suggested, I pop them in the fridge before cooking so they can firm up. Definitely recommend!

A different kind of burger but with an amazing taste; this is a delicious twist on a regular burger it's perfect if you are on a diet, avoiding red meat or just in the mood for something different. When you put the burger together with ketchup, mustard, the buns melted cheese etc. you can't even say it's made of tuna. Recipe is accurate and easy to follow, if you don't want them spicy you can leave out the hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I’m definitely making them again and very often.

AMAZING !!! I made this with a few alterations. I didnt have celery or red pepper so I skipped. Instead I used about a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I also am not sure what hot pepper sauce is but I used Red Hot hot sauce (half teaspoon) instead.  I opted for minced green onion instead of white. I added about a tablespoon of lemon juice and also 1 1/2 tablespoons of Mrs.Dash Garlic and herb seasoning. It was good to the last bite. I have a little left over for tomorrow I just cant wait to eat it up.

I've never made tuna patties before and I wanted to see how my kids would receive them. My pickiest eater, Audrianna, loved them. She ate almost the whole thing and I made them pretty big.

I thought the original description was a little cheesy but I've made these things 4 times now and it's one of my all time favorites!    Who would have known that canned tuna could be this good?!

I think i may have added a dash too much of pepper because this is was incredibly hot!!! my dad is a big pepper fan and he even said "wow, this has a lot of pepper!" so im not sure if thats the recipe or if it was me. but otherwise it tasted delish! I formed the burgers in ziplock bags so theyd hold shape and threw them in the freezer to set them faster. i skipped out on celery and peppers.. dont like my burgers crunchy.. they tasted kinda like crab cakes but with tuna.. yum! next time ill go easy on the pepper and se what happens.. they also cooked better on my george foreman grill.. they were crumbling in the frying pan when i would flip them

I think I rated this already but I had to come back to share what I did with this recipe tonight. I ran out of bread crumbs so I used Doritos and french fried onions in place of the onions and bread crumbs.  Hehehe...It was really very tasty! A very versitile recipe that will definitely stay in my recipe box :)

I agree with all the reviewers who said this recipe was very forgiving. I had no celery salt (subbed celery salt), no onions (subbed onion powder), skipped the bell pepper completely, plus doubled the tuna, egg, and breadcrumbs, and didn't even SEE the mayo til they were already frying up.  Didn't need it, put these in the fridge for a few minutes and they browned up with a surprisingly turkey-burger-like texture.  Great in buns, with frozen tater tots and a salad!

These were great and do not have that salmon patty taste.  I added an extra egg to the mix for better binding of ingredients.. Tarter sause or a lime/lemon mayonaise sause make this a perfect meal...

I love these burgers. I was nervous about how it was going to come out. I dont like spicy foods so i left the hot sauce and chilli sauce out. It was great and my family loved them. The second time we made them my sister used two cans of tuna because she felt that the burger were too thin.

Followed the original recipe EXCEPT used 2 cans of well-drained tuna in order to make 4 patties as noted by another reviewer.  Recipe does not state frying temp--I used medium heat.  As noted, these are very fragile so I made sure the bottom was well browned before turning. My husband and I both found these burgers delicious and a refreshing change of pace.

These were delicious!  They had a lot of flavor!  I did have to double the bread crumbs so they werent so wet.  These were great on buns with tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato.  They made a great sandwich and is a great healthier alternative to hamburger.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Could not even tell they were made from a can of tuna!  I used Sriracha (rooster sauce) as my chili sauce, it has bite, so I skipped the hot sauce.  Really good and since we love heat, these were perfect!!! Yum!

Great recipe idea! I wasn't able to follow the recipe exactly, because I didn't have all ingredients on hand, but it turned out really well. I used nonfat yogurt instead of mayo, 2 cans of tuna and cooked them on my george foreman grill. I will definitely make this again and try different flavor combinations. Healthy, super easy and budget friendly!

Not the taste we were expecting, on the dry side (yet too much moisture would make them fall apart).  They were ok, just not knock your socks off in my family's opinion.

Another recipe I can't believe I haven't reviewed!  I've made this over and over again.  They are so flavorful and actually healthy!  I use Sriracha hot chili sauce, and you only need about a tablespoon unless you like it really spicy!  I serve them on wholegrain sandwich thins.  Delish!  Oh, and I double it so we have leftovers.  Definitely try this one!

I won't touch tuna, so I'm going on hubby's rating for this on. He really loved them. I served them on a whole wheat buns with some spicy mayo and the lettuce and tomato suggested. One thing I will comment on is that you definitely need the 30 mintues in the fridge or they will fall apart on you. Even after that, they are quite fragile, so be very careful.

Not bad at all...I must admit I was skeptical because when it comes to burgers, nothing beats MEAT!!!  But this was a nice surprise, I didnt refrigerate it first and I didnt hve any crumbling problems.  I did use only the one can of tuna and it was definately enough without sacrificing taste of the tuna.  My husband used to eat something like this when he was kid but used to eat it with melted cheese on top.  Next time I think I will try it that way too, but they DO make a tasty burger.  Thank you for the recipe.

These are absolutely delicious! I used chili powder instead of sauce, because that's what Ii had on hand. Used much less of it though. Afer cooling in the fridge for many hours, they were still very delicate and hard to handle, so do NOT flip more than once! I served them with homemade burger buns(burger or hotdog buns from this site),some tartar sauce, and a leaf of lettuce. Heavenly!! Next time, I'll try to find a way to make these less fragile, but taste the same. Thanks so much!

These were great! I've been referring to them as "The Poor Man's Crab Cake". :) I did make a few modifications- I used a 4.5oz can of albacore and a 4.5oz packet of garlic and herb flavored tuna, and subbed egg substitute for the egg, green pepper for the red, and miracle whip for the mayo. I also added a little garlic powder. I was able to make 4 perfect patties without refrigerating by forming the mix into a ball, scoring into 4 equal sections, rolling each section into a ball and pressing these into the frying pan. These will definitely be an addition to our dinner menu! Thanks!

I loved these and will probably be making them often! I did add the Old Bay seasoning, and didn't use the dill. A litter heavier on the Worcestshire and hot sauce as well according to my own tastes. I found increasing the bread crumbs and decreasing the mayo made them a little sturdier. It also will help if you use the white albacore as opposed to the chunk lite tuna. It is a little drier. As for the people complaining about texture- it is still tuna so it will be a little mushy, but I cooked mine on an indoor grill on the solid side and cooked them til they were browned on both sides and heated through. They came out wonderful! Thanks to the chef for a new great way to prepare tuna!!

Pretty good, actually. It definitely helps by draining the tuna well and even squeezing out any excess water. I added some Old Bay and cayenne pepper to mine, and I felt that the spiciness was a fantastic compliment to these. This is another great way to use up those tuna cans in the cupboard.

First, just to "bump up" the issue about the chili sauce back near the top... there is a specific thing just called chili sauce (Heinz being one producer), in with the condiments, near ketchup, etc.  It's sort of a tangy ketchup, but NOT hot.  A mixture of ketchup & cocktail sauce might work??  Changes made: only had plain breadcrumbs so added some It. seasoning, used dehydrated onion & mashed them because I knew I wouldn't like onion pieces in it, & left out celery & bell pepper (again texture hangup).  So they were close, dill weed, chili sauce and all -- just left out a bit of crunch.  (Oh, and I didn't have lettuce but no biggie.)  They weren't *that* tasty, but they were OK.  Maybe a good thing when I just want something a bit different.  They weren't very filling -- I'd want two.  I did smash them down quite a bit, and then cooked them on one side without turning until they were almost crispy done and they turned easily.  From there it was quite easy to burn the second side so I had to watch that. 
Edit: No, Holly doesn't need to clarify anything -- it's called chili sauce.  Period.  It's existed for years.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband, on the other hand, did not (but he doesn't like crab cakes, so that is why). I thought that they held together great, and I also did not use all the ingredients as I didn't have them (peppars, dill weed, etc). I still thought that they were delicous - and great on the George Forman. I will make again.

I'm always looking to find recipes that have tuna in it and I'm sick of tuna salads.  When I read this recipe I decided why not!  I have all the ingredients at home.  I tell my husband what we're having for dinner and he has the phone in his hand ready to call Pizza Pizza. lol  Well, three burgers later (yup) and he's telling me (with his mouth full) WOW, you wouldn't know you're eating tuna, that's for sure!  I topped it off with Mozzarella and mayo and used the George Foreman Grill!  Will definitely make again :)  Thanks Holly!

This was a tasty tuna burger. Easy to make and I topped it off with tartar sauce. Roasted red potatoes and onions with dill weed. Cheap to make, but only got three nice size patties.

I was going to make tuna melts tonight but saw this recipe and decided to try it; it was no more work than making the tuna melt and it was really good. Not having any red pepper on hand, I used grated carrot, and used oregano as we prefer that to the dill. Will definitely make this again.

These are super fats and very tasty! I didn't have dill so I put a little pickle juice in the mix. I will definitely make these again.

I made these tuna burgers for the family and we loved them.  Delicious.  Again, I followed the recipe closely but DID use three cans of tuna which made 8 small burgers which were perfect for the Wonder Bread small sized buns.  I just knew that 1 can would not be enough.  A type-O in the recipe maybe?  Thanks.

These were great! I didn't have red bell pepper so I left that out. I also replaced the chili sauce with 3T oil and 2t lemon juice. I also left out the dill. I used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs and a little more than 3/4 cup of mayo and they stayed together very well. Very flavorful. I never realized tuna patties could taste so delicious. I enjoyed mine plain, but the kids enjoyed theirs topped with sour cream, ketchup or margarine. I served them with baked potatoes instead of a bun as another reviewer suggested.

I bought a 6 oz. packet of tuna which was perfect. I added all the ingredients as stated. I chilled them for 30 mins. before frying them. I used a nonstick pan sprayed with Pam. They turned out perfect. They held together beautifully. I had no problem with them at all. I think they are even better served without a hamburger bun, on a plate with tomatoes and lettuce and maybe some coleslaw. I will be making them again. Try the packets of tuna fish. I think there is less moisture in those than the canned and it is a little more than 6 ozs.  My husband doesn't like tuna fish but he tried this and gave it a thumbs up. "Very good".

Very good!!!  I made some subs due to lack of ingredients but they turned out to be good.  I sub the onion with green onion, the chili sauce with chili powder, omitted the dill bc didn't have it and the mayo to cut calories.

These were delicious! I used albacor tuna...made these meaty and delicious!  We grilled our patties on a gas grill using a grill pan sprayed with olive oil cooking spray...about 3 minutes each side. We ate these on homemade buns and topped the patties with a special pink sauce (ketchup/mayo mixed together). Almost tasted like a restaurant!

I don't like tuna that much but decided to give this a try...so glad I did!  Made a few changes.  Used one 12 oz. can of albacore tuna (that's a must!).  Didn't have chili sauce so used one Tablespoon of chili powder.  Everything else stayed the same.  Didn't serve on bun, just served as meat with tomatoes, lettuce and Ranch dressing on the side.  Also fixed garlic mashed potatoes (made with red potatoes from A.R.)  SUCH A HEALTHY MEAL.  So glad I tried it!

These are outstanding!  I did not use the dill, pepper sauce or chili sauce.  I doubled the recipe then lightly oiled a glass baking dish, and using a round egg chopper, I placed it in the baking dish and filled the center with the mix - making a nice patty.  I used the egg chopper to make a total of 5 patties.  I put them in the oven set to 400 and let it bake for approximately 30-40 minutes.  They tasted wonderful!  I served it with cocktail sauce.  YUM and easy!

I just made these and they are delicious.  I used 2 small cans of tuna but didn't adjust the other ingredients to fit.  I also omitted the hot pepper sauce because the chili sauce I use is extremely spicy.  It made 3 large patties.  My 14 month old daughter loves them.  This is definitely something I will be making again!

Great tasting and economical! Very easily adjusted if you don't have all the ingredients or wish to change the flavour... I changed the chili sauce to Asian dressing and added garlic. I will certainly save this recipe and recommend it to my friends. The one can made 4 x 4" burgers which was a good size for me.

Love love love this recipe! Made it for the first time last night and my whole family was thrilled. I used plain bread crumbs because that's what I had, and I didn't have chili sauce so that was omitted.

I wasn't that big of a fan.  I didn't listen to other reviewers about using plain bread crumbs over Italian, if I made them again I'd use plain.  Something (probably oregano) was overpowering.   I added lemon juice and thought about adding dill pickles but didn't (maybe next time).

LOVE these!  I'm trying to only eat fish sparingly, as opposed to meat, so these made a great substitute for me at Memorial Day festivities!  My patties weren't as delicate as I thought, which was a bonus, and I didn't even chill them for the suggested 30 minutes. I also loved all the veggies these burgers contain!  I had to use regular ketchup, as opposed to chili sauce, and regular bread crumbs instead of Italian (based on what I had in the pantry.)  Long review short:  LOVE!

Very good and very easy, the middle was a little mushy still so I would maybe cook them a little longer.  I did them on buns with ranch dressing made a great hot day meal!

This was really easy to work with. I left out the chili paste and worchestershire sauce, because I didn't have any. I only had plain bread crumbs, and don't think I would have liked the Italian. When I formed the patties I made sure my hands were coated with olive oil and they were easy to handle. I also didn't chill them for 30 min. Just threw them right on the skillet.

I was skeptical at first about this recipe, buy it really did prove me wrong in a good way!! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add celery or a bell pepper. Instead of frying them I cooked them in a panini grill for several minutes on each side. The texture & flavor of this patty was ON POINT! So scrumptious, & even my picky husband liked it. One little thing I noticed is that you can't get 4 patties out of 1 can of tuna, but for us as a couple this recipe made 2 very filling tuna burgers :)

These are fantastic! I was weary of there being just one can of tuna to make four burgers, but they are actually quite a perfect size. (Not the xtra huge serving size that many Americans are used to, maybe). I followed the directions *almost* exactly. I did saute the veggies first to soften (I'm just not a fan of raw onions & celery). The consistency was perfect. I'm also not a big fan of dill and went back and forth as to whether I should put it in. I DID and didn't really taste it specifically - but I'm thinking it was a great complement to the tuna and other flavors. Really, really, really, really good burgers.

This was soo good! I just adjusted the spices a little more to my liking - I wanted them to have a sort of convincing meaty taste.  I subbed the Italian seasonings for some fresh garlic and some cumin, and subbed parsley for the dill weed.  This was great we'll make it again!

We ran out of breadcrumbs so we didn't use the full amount listed--and boy were we lucky! These were barely edible; it was like eating a bread sandwich. The consistency was fine, but I had a hard time finding any tuna flavor amidst the bread.

I gave this 3 stars b/c I needed 2 cans of tuna, used plain bread crumbs and omitted the celery. The flavor was really good. But boy are they fragile, especially on a George Foreman-like grill! Once cooked, the texture of the tuna burger by itself was good but pairing it with a hamburger bun made the whole thing feel really mushy. A better choice by far would be crisp crackers or toasted/broiled baguette slices.

These are super tasty! I added an extra can of tuna , used green onions and omited the hot sauce. Next time i will sauté the veggies and let cool before mixing, so they are not so crunchy. Thanks for the recipe :)

Loved this recipe. Didn't add a thing! But left out the hot sauce and dill because I didn't have any. Oh and sweet chili sauce works great as a sub for chili sauce. I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE!! So yummy!

This recipe was easy to throw together as most of the ingredients are readily available in most pantries. We piled it high with avocados, onions, tomatoes, organic bread and butter pickles and spinach. For me, the veggies really made the burger.

These were good as they were, but they were out of this world with the following changes:

1)  Use high quality albacore tuna. 
2)  Use two cans instead of one. 
3)  Make your own bread. 
4)  Make your own italian breadcrumbs.  There is a good recipe on this site for doing so.  When you 
5)  When you make your own italian breadcrumbs, use fresh herbs from your garden.  (sorry, even the fresh ones from the grocery store aren't all that great.)
6)  Make your own hamburger buns. 

This is, of course, an increase in prep time  so you have to plan ahead.  But if you do, it makes SUCH a difference!

This was way better than I expected. I was just looking for a new way to use up some tuna, but these were awesome! I made modifications based on what I had on hand - made my own bread crumbs (2 pieces of toast, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning), green onions instead of white, and no chili sauce. I served them on whole wheat buns with spinach, avocado and tartar sauce. It ended up making only 3 patties for me, but I did make them large due to the size of buns we had.

These did NOT fall apart when I did this: Doubled tuna (it comes in 5 ounce cans these days anyway), halved mayo and chili sauce, and used 1 rounded TB. instant minced onion to help with the excessive moisture others complained about. Definitely use the well-minced celery and red pepper--it tastes far better than you would expect in this recipe! I used less dill and added some cayenne, taste-testing the vegetable/mayo mixture before I added the eggs, crumbs and tuna. A previous reviewer's idea to use the "George Foreman" grill was INGENIOUS. I did just that and was thrilled :) Will definitely make again. Salmon in this would be excellent, as would green onion for the onion. Did not prefer the Italian crumb, however- next time will use plain.

Good way to use canned tuna.  I omitted the chopped onion, red bell peppers, and celery.  and included the green chile, onion, and garlic paste I made yesterday.  I added more hot sauce, etc.  Might want to add more bread crumbs and cook longer for a slightly tougher texture.  Probably would bake well, but I like the sear on the oustide.

I didn't have any chili sauce so I used tabasco sauce, and instead of buns I used tortillas.  Also I chilled it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes for better handling.  We thought this recipe was amazing and would defiantly make again!

Yummy! My tuna can was only 5 oz, so I compensated by using a tad less mayo and a tad more breadcrumbs. Had no celery so used celery salt instead of salt. Otherwise kept to the recipe (well, I think I was a little heavy handed with the chili sauce, hot sauce, and Worcestershire, didn't measure). Cooked on my cast iron skillet. Yes it is soft, but I've found with soft things like this if you use very low heat it has time to cook through without over browning. Easy on cast iron! Stayed moist and I didn't need/want any condiments like mayo on the sandwich. Very rare for me. Oh, I did top with sharp cheddar besides the tomato. Got 3 sammies instead of the 4 predicted in recipe. NUM.

Great idea for using tuna other than casserole or salad.  I used 3 cans tuna, 2 eggs, fresh breadcrumbs differently from original but all the other ingredients the same.  Would recommend.

Yum! These were very good! Ive never had anything like this b4. I didnt use any celery but I sauteed the onion and peppers bec I wanted them alittle soft. I doubled the recipe and that made me 6 med size burgers.(had some mild chedder cheese on top) Also added alittle more breadcrumbs but everything else I left the same. Went well with crispy potato wedges from this site. Great way to switch things up! Will make again.

These had really good flavor. I give it 4 stars at the insistence of my fiance, who thinks his tuna burgers are the best ever (hehe). He really wasn't all that crazy about the chunks of celery, so next time I would probably put the celery and pepper (I omit the onions) through the food processor. I did use 2 cans of tuna, keeping all other ingredients the same, and ended up with 4 thick burgers. Thank you, this is a really tasty, really economical recipe!

YUM. Not sure what people did wrong with this recipe. My kids LOVED these. I am always on the lookout for kid-friendly fish recipes. I did make the following changes:
Subbed ketchup for the chili sauce and ommitted the hot sauce. Added juice of 1/2 a lime. Ran out of bread crumbs so I crushed up ritz crackers for 1/2 of the cup I needed (since I doubled recipe). THIS is what I think made them extra yummy. I dropped them by the soup spoonful (a la chocolate chip cookie) into a skillet with a little olive oil and browned them on both sides. I doubled the recipe and my three kids (6,5 and 2.5) ate them ALL for lunch. I think the recipe would be awesome with a spicy dip as appetizers. I will definitely be making these weekly. Thanks!!

I used 2 cans of tuna and double the bread crumbs, put the vegies through the food processor so that they were finely chopped, they were easy to handle and cooked nicely on the cast iron griddle, I didn't have chili sauce either so used ketchup and 1/2 tsp. chili powder

I like these, but always have trouble cooking them. Somehow I can never seem to get the middles cooked very easily, so they have a strange texture. I've tried grill pans and also baking them (375 degrees, flipping after 10 minutes, it worked pretty well.) I leave out the dill, and use more breadcrumbs. I think I'd be giving this 5 stars if I could ever figure out what I'm doing wrong in the actual cooking department!

Pretty good, but were bland.  I recommend Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning.  I usually add it to my tuna dishes - it'll make these perfect!

These are really good.  The only hard part for me was the mincing of the veggies. I did it by hand and wanted to make sure the chunks weren't too big. The patties held together just fine by following the directions and I was able to get four patties easily.  There seems to be some confusion about what chili sauce is. There is a product available that is similar to chunky ketchup or a cocktail sauce. That's what I assumed the recipe required and that's what I used. It's not spicy. It would be nice if Holly could clarify for us, exactly what kind of sauce is supposed to be used.
I only had plain breadcrumbs and I will use the Italian version next time for more seasoning. I think I'd like a bit of lemon juice mixed in too, or maybe squeezed on top before serving. I topped with tartar sauce and ate three. Yum. Someday I'll try it on a bun like a burger.

Awesome!  Never knew canned tuna could taste so wonderful.  I followed the recipe to the t, except I didn't add bell pepper or dill since I didn't have any.  Anyhow, I felt 2 tblsps of chili sauce was way too much, but I followed it and it was spicy!  Luckily, we love spicy foods and can handle it, but for others, either cut back on the chili sauce (2 tsps?) or you will be dying.  Served these on sandwich slices and tomato and it was devine.

These "burgers" are great!  I omitted the onion, salt and pepper, and used green pepper and maybe slightly more bread crumbs than called for, and these came out excellent!  I got 3 decent sized patties, though, not four, but they were very tasty and are similar to my mother's salmon patties.  Easy, fast and delicious.  Highly recommend.

We went off bread (for about ten minutes-haha) and I made these tasty patties without the bun, and they are truly wonderful.  Great flavor, much better than any mix, and easy as pie to prepare.  Super recipe!

These are a good alternative to fatty hamburgers and were tasty enough.  I minced my veggies in a one cup food processor, which added more liquid to the recipe.  I had to add another cup or so of breadcrumbs to make up for the extra liquid.  I cooked these on my George Foreman Grill for four minutes.  Our main quandry was which sauce to use on our burgers.  I chose mayo, my husband chose ketchup and neither of us was really satisfied.  Next time, we'll try tartar sauce or thousand island dressing.  My nineteen month old, who normally eats anything, wouldn't touch these.

Nice but I didn't include the chilli sauce, worcestershire sauce, dill or hot pepper sauce. Plenty of flavour still without all of those extra things. Didn't bind as well as I would've liked but at least they still held their shape a bit and didn't totally crumble.

These tuna burgers are super delish to my delighted suprise. Do need to use 2 cans tuna and a lil extra bread crumbs, good stuff. Try the garlic jalapeno aioli recipe on this site as a topper, so good!

We have made tuna "patties" for many years, just never served on a bun. We have always served them, as a salad component. They are great, just served on a bed of lettuce, with tomatoes and whatever else you want to add. But this recipe adds a lot of extra flavor, to the patties. We used to just make the patties with chopped onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, egg and bread crumbs. This recipe is a flavorful improvement.

JUST finished making this... I was watching the recipe earlier and almost every time she added an ingredient I thought, I have that! The only thing I was missing was egg, breadcrumbs and buns to serve it on! This was so good, even my picky husband liked it ;) I substituted ketchup for the chili sauce and left out the dash of hot pepper sauce as I am also cooking for elderly but made mine with a sriracha mayo! SO GOOD!

Ok...these were delish!! I did use tuna from pouch instead of can. I also did not have bread crumbs so I smashed up Ritz crackers and used Sriracha sauce-just a little.  I followed the recipe other than those things. Restaurant quality. Very impressed-thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! Oh and I also made a yummy dill sauce for dipping because I did not have buns. Went well together. Thanks again!

In a jam for dinner tonight? Make these! SO easy. I didn't even have the fresh veggies...I used the one egg, 1/4c mayo, 1/2c bread crumbs, can of tuna, dash of Worcestershire, and sprinkled in as much as I wanted onion, garlic, celery seed..dash pepper..dash chili powder...aweeesoommmmeeee..loved them! Only made 2 burgers probably because of the mass missing from the ingredients I left out. Totally worth trying!

I don't know if I did something wrong, or what, but my tuna cakes didn't hold together at all. I put in the ingredients and followed the instructions and even cooled it for the specified amount of time. No good. I'll be looking elsewhere for this one.

This was absolutely delicious! I ended up using 2 cans of 4 oz tuna in olive oil and added 1/4 cup of panko breadcrumbs ( not italian seasoned). It was delicious with a slice of tomato, lettuce, jarlsberg cheese and a mix of mayo and harissa paste ( north african hot pepper paste found in middle eastern shops). Thank you!!!

Cheap, quick and tasty! I just got a craving for a burger and almost went out to get a greasy beef burger from a fast food restaurant. Instead I decided to see if there was a recipe for a tuna burger since I had a can handy. I basically used this as a template for a tuna burger. I used yum yum sauce instead of mayo (it adds a nice flavor and I didn't need to add other spices... which I didn't have) and it tasted, well, yummy.

Loved it!! I added extra celery. I also didn't use Italian bread crumbs, instead I used white bread crumbs. Also, I used 2 tablespoons on mayonnaise...1/4 a cup is waaay to much.

This is a must try! I don't really care for canned tuna but it was the only thing in the house so I decided to look up recipes. This recipe was the only I found that sounded appetizing. Instead of red pepper I used marinated roasted red peppers. I also added pepper jack cheese to it. Delicious!!

Had an okay flavor, but the consistency was way to moist.  I'll do something else with the "burger" meat I prepared.  But it sure won't be this.

They were OK, kind of like crab cakes. Unfortunately neither of my toddlers ate more than a bite of the burgers, they only ate the buns. :( I don't think I'll be making this again.

The patties were way too liquidy.  Even cooking them with a crusty outside, the inside was still too wet.  Nothing at all like a burger.  .  It needs more breadcrumbs or something to give it some body so it is similar to a burger.

Very good with modifications. I make thai tuna sometimes(add thai red curry paste) and we tried burgers that way, so delicious! We never add the pepper or celery (SO hates celery, I hate pepper)and it seems that may have been for the best.

When it comes to cooking, treat them like crab cakes and make sure they're not staying cold/uncooked inside. The flatter the better.

Good spices to use (depending on your taste): thai red curry paste, sriracha, worc. sauce, soy, etc. TIP: taste a bit along the way to make sure everything is good to go.

Again, good base recipe but -1 star for it not being stellar on its own.

This is a good recipe! For anyone who lives on a budget you can't go wrong with this. It's filling, and taste great! I didn't quite have everything to make it according to the recipe, but suprizingly what I used worked out well. I doubled the batch and had no problems with it. I omited the minced onion and used onion powder. Used a good amount of sweet pickle relish in place of the celery and bell pepper and swapped the chili sauce for sweet and sour. To help with the sticking I patted breadcrumbs on the outside, makes a nice crispy coating as well. My family and I enjoyed this and we will be having them again. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I cut the bell peppers and didn't miss them, but that's just my taste. This would make a great appetizer as smaller bite-sized patties.

I did not put onions, chili sauce or hot pepper sauce because my family does not like spicy food, instead I added "Wickles" on top of my cooked burger.  Very tasty and the kids liked them too!

This is yummy! I'm happy because now I have new options for tuna. This recipe is going into heavy rotation. I omitted the celery, because I'm not a fan. I also left out the red peppers, tomato & lettuce because I didn't have any on hand. I'm currently making the last of the mix & may spread some remolade on the toasted bread.

My 3 year old actually requested to have tuna one night for supper, so I searched for a recipe that would jazz up the tuna a bit.  These burgers went over really well with everyone!!!  I put mine on the George Foreman grill and they are perfect!!  Served them with some homemade onion rings from this site and a cucumber, chick pea, and cherry tomato salad w/ an Italian dressing and what a delicious, filling, SIMPLE meal!

Not bad - what a surprise.  I mixed the tuna with chopped onion, pepper and mushroom, added 2 TBSP each of cream/celery and cream/mushroom soup.  I forgot to add the egg, but I didn't miss it. Pinches of salt, pepper, garlic - no muss no fuss.  I didn't use alot of bread crumbs-didn't want them grainy.   
But yeah, flipping them was a problem-I may broil or Foreman Grill them next time instead.  A slice of swiss over the tomato, some chips on the side and you've got yourself a party!   I'll DEFINITELY try these again, perhaps with salmon too!!

Great! I haven't messured it out but has turned out great twice. I tryed using salmon leftovers and not as good would need some more tinkering. I use pickles instead of dill (don't have dill). My G.F. loved it but I didn't put much hot stuff in she hates spicy stuff. I want to try it useing the exact recipe (actually messure) I bet it's better. Alittle hard to work with but not bad. Don't flip to early.

This recipe is a solid reliable recipe but it also can be switched up wonderfully. I just made it as mini cakes with a can of diced chilis and a couple tablespoons of old bay. Cracker crumbs would have been the way to go but I had none, so I went with panko and corn stuffing. I topped them off with a basic aioli (made with lemon, dijon, mayo and garlic) and half a cherry tomato. I used a 12 oz. can of tuna without changing the rest of the quantities.

This a great meal on the cheap.  I would recommend 2 cans of tuna (albacore preferably) and 1 diced jalapeno without seeds.  It really added the right zip to what would have been rather bland.

These were really good, mine were very crumbly but that may have been my fault since I used one of those small cans of flavoured tuna which have a lot more moisture in them.

Mmm! These are better than you might imagine. Tasty and easy to prepare. I did a light coating of panko bread crumbs before frying as another reviewer suggested...adds a nice crunch.

I have to say they are more like croquettes.  For us, the texture is too soft for eating on a bun.

I made these tonight and was skeptical that one can would make 4 patties, but it did!  I doubled the recipe just in case and the kids and I loved them!  I didn't use celery, red peppers, chili or dill because I decided last-minute to make these and didn't have those ingredients and they were still great!  Quick, easy and yummy!

Easy and fast! I premixed the ingredients for the burger several hours beforehand and shaped them into patties for refridgeration. When it was dinner time, they took about 15 minutes to completely cook, assemble and serve. Very nice.

Delicious!  As others did, I switched out some of the ingredients.  Best to refrigerate before making into patties.  I rolled patties in bread crumbs before cooking.  Easy & tasty for a different meal option with tuna!!  Served up with dill sauce & crispy lettuce on toasted potato buns & sharp Vermont cheddar cheese!

Pretty darn good! Maybe a little too much chili sauce?  I did this recipe mostly as per directions -- only thing different was that I used regular homemade bread crumbs and added about 1/4 tap dried oregano.

I only gave this 4-stars b/c I didn't have all the ingredients and had to improvise.  But I would give my recipe 5-stars!!!  I didn't have peppers on hand, so with the onion, I diced up some fresh baby spinach, chopped basil, and about 1/3 cup of frozen corn kernels.  I only used about 1/8 cup of mayo.  I used chili powder, mustard powder, a dash of Worcestershire, a few dashes of Frank's hot sauce, and some garlic salt.  This made two large burgers that did not need a bun! To finish it, I drizzled a little melted butter mixed with lemon juice and dried dill.  It was such a quick and easy way to use canned tuna.    This was absolutely delicious!!!  I will most definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

Made this the other day for dinner.  It was fantastic.  It was a little spicy for my friend but you can easily alter the amount of chili sauce/hot sauce to your preferred taste.  I highly recommend this innovative way of enjoying tuna :)

My family loved these! I used 3 cans (5 oz. each) of tuna, shrimp & seafood sauce instead of chili sauce, 2 eggs, and used panko breadcrumbs: mixing half the amount in the patty and using the other half as a breading.  YUM!

These were surprisingly delicious!! I've been looking for ways to spruce up canned tuna and this recipe is a keeper! I agree with another reviewer in that they somewhat taste like crab cakes. Yummy! I pretty much tripled the ingredients, played with random herbs I had in my drawer, and will do this all over again next week!

Yummy!!!  I didn't have any celery or peppers so I left them out.  These were sooo good.  I would prefer these any day to a regular ol' burger.  Next time I will try and add some bell pepper.....I will be making these every week from now on.

Very good. They do taste a bit like crab cakes. I followed the recipe except left the celery out and used 2 5oz cans of tuna. Can't imagine that one would be enough.

Great -- even better the next day, believe it or not!  We just ate as patties with a side of grits instead of on a bun.  I would recommend altering the amount of tuna.  I made a triple batch of the recipe using 5 (5 oz.) cans of tuna and it was perfect!

I made my own breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavor of the burger was very nice, though I think I would prefer less filler in the future. The mixture was very loose when I first mixed it, so I let it chill for about half an hour. It was still quite loose, though formable, so I formed and baked them until they were firm. Then I pan fried them to brown them and crisp them up. They did not fall apart when we ate them. I think over-cooking them makes them more stable, and didn't seem to effect the flavor :).

I'm on the fence with this one. I think the flavor can be improved upon, I'm just not sure how to do it. We did eat ours, though, so...probably 3.5 stars. I doubled the recipe because there's no way that 2 oz of tuna constitutes a meat serving in this house, no matter how many vegetables and bread crumbs you dress it up with. Doubling the recipe yielded 5 respectably sized burgers. I did chill them in the fridge 30 mins, but I don't think I needed to really. I eliminated the raw vegetables from this recipe (replacing the onion with dehydrated onion) and that allows the meat, crumbs, and egg to bind together. If you plan to use the veggies, grate them as small as you can to make it easier to work with the patties (give them less slick surface area to slide away with). They were very pretty when done, & I served them as tuna melts on pumpernickel slices. Thanks for the recipe, I may wind up trying this one again, because I think it's only a small shade away from perfect and I bet I can figure out what's missing :)

These tuna burgers are delicious - I tripled the recipe and froze half for later.  I like them more than turkey burgers and perhaps even salmon burgers - a childhood favourite of mine.   I had difficulty however cooking them. The suggested length of time was not enough.. they were too soft. Next time I will try baking them and maybe cut some of the mayo.  i added cumin and hungarian sweet paprika, that was heaven

I absolutely loved it! My 7 year-old and two year-old ate them all! I used the roasted red peppers that come in a jar. And I ommited the chilli sauce and used  the Thai sweet sauce on the side. I also had sliced avocados with lemon on top. I served them with a salad and brown rice. This recipe is  is a keeper!

I loved these burgers!  I went a little heavier on the onion, celery & pepper and left out the taco sauce.  I did put them in the fridge prior to cooking and they did not fall apart at all.  A new favorite; I'll be making these again soon.

These were awesome! I just threw eveything in my little food processor so that I wouldn't have to mix/chop anything. Stuck in the fridge for a half hour and made them into patties. They were delicious!

Very good!  A little difficult to flip because they are very tender and tend to fall apart but tasted great.  DH rolled them up in a tortilla and said they almost had the consistency of a burrito.  He has already asked me to put this in the "rotation".  I used whole wheat bread crumbs and it meets the south beach diet requirements.  Thank you!

I made these today and I have to say they were really good. I didn't have bell pepper, dill, worcestershire or chili sauce. So I omitted them, but it didn't make much difference. I just used cayenne pepper powder, 3/4 cup bread crumbs and used 2 cans of tuna for 4 burgers. Crispy on the outside, and creamy inside.

With a family of 6, it's hard to find something everyone agrees on.  This got 5/6, including fussy hubby.  My 4year old wants to know when we can have "crabby patties" again.

I really like this recipe. Made it last night before bed in fact, so I had a yummy lunch today. I'll be making it again in the near future, but as some said, I'll likely leave out the dill (didn't do it for me) and half the celery, too powerful. I think I'll alslo roast the onion and pepper before mixing it together. This is a winner in my book!

This was incredibly good, and very simple! I followed everything almost to a T. Had seasoned bread crumbs on hand, not italian, and used 3/4 cup. Left out the dill weed and added a heaping teaspoon of sweet pickle relish. Did a quick saute on the vegetables. Mixed it all up, made two large patties and refrigerated for a half hour. Cooked as suggested and topped with a slice of swiss cheese. Enjoyed the burger on a whole grain bun and some tartar sauce. Do not pass this up!! It was crazy good. My family loved it! Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe! I omitted the dill and added sriracha sauce which gave them some nice kick.  On toasted buns with a slice of swiss on top. Also used a 12oz can of tuna and made five patties.  Will most definitley make this again for hubby and kids!

My boyfriend and I loved these burgers! As the reviews suggested I left out the dill and used regular bread crumbs and the flavor was perfect! I'm a pretty inexperienced cook but these were so quick and easy, I'll definitely make them again.

Love these.  I had no bread crumbs so used a few handfuls of white flour & a big handful of oatmeal and it did the trick.  I completely omitted the mayonnaise and it was great anyway!  These were surprisingly tasty, alone or with buns.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!

Very good.  Didn't have chili sauce so I used tiger sauce (which we love) and it gave them a bit of a kick.

So easy! So cheap! I thought the 2 tblsp. of chili sauce (I use Sriracha) was a bit much. I only used 1 tblsp. the second time I made them and they were perfect! I also omit the celery, use green onions instead and omitted the dill as well.  So yummy!

I made this for one and two yr olds so I replaced the veggies with powder counterparts and left out hot sauces. I read previous reviews so I added more breadcrumbs to make up for sogginess. I also added ketchup. My one and a half yr old gobbled this up. Thanks.

These tasted really good, were easy to prepare and I had most of the ingredients on hand, so that makes a recipe a winner in my book. I used plain breadcrumbs that I made myself, celery seed and onion powder instead of fresh, and I left out the dill. I didn't have chili sauce so I used ketchup and chili powder. I'm sure it's not quite the same but it tasted good so that what matters to me. Also, I didn't have enough mayo so I used half mayo and half tartar sauce. You really need to use two cans of tuna but leave everything else the same.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked them on the foreman grill.  Yummy.

You can also use fresh tuna in place of the canned, and it makes a good approximation of the yummy tuna burgers sold at Legal Sea Foods.  I use 1 and 1/3 pounds of sushi-grade tuna and slice it into 1/4-inch cubes (slow work).  Scale up the other ingredients (two eggs, 3/4 - 1 cup breadcrumbs, etc.) and this will make 6 large burgers.

I substitute green onions (a whole bunch) for the onion, and add 1TBS of Old Bay (omit the salt as Old Bay is very salty).  I also mince 1 jalapeno pepper, but I like it a bit spicy.

I cook it on an oiled, pre-heated griddle on med-low heat for 8-10 minutes per side.  This cooks the fish through, crusts the outside, and does not leave it mushy at all.  I have not yet dared to try it on a grill for fear it might crumble.

I didn't like these. The inside was very mushy, and i even cooked them a little longer than suggested. I thought with all of the ingredients, the tuna flavor would mellow out some, but it doesn't. Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

This is a GREAT recipe.  We boat alot and Tuna (plus other fish) is so easy to carry along - this is a keeper for ease and taste.  Even the kids enjoyed these.  I followed other reviews and added 3/4 c bread crumbs, PLUS instead of the minced onions - i used 1/3 cup of Frendch's french fried onions.  Will definitely make again and again (next step I'll try premaking them and freezing so I can just pop into a pan and fry.)

These were tasty although I did make a few changes.  I used ketchup instead of chili sauce and I used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs.  I also dropped the mixture onto a greased baking sheet by big spoonfuls and flattened with a spoon.  My boys ate them with melted cheese on top and ketchup and my husband enjoyed his with mayo and pickles!  The whole family thought they were good and a change from plain old tuna sandwiches.

This is a terrific idea for tuna.  I changed the recipe a bit.  

I made breadcrumbs - 2 pieces of bread in the processor (comes to about 1 cup breadcrumbs).  Added oregano, basil, dill weed and pepper.  Mixed in 1 6oz can tuna, 1/4 C mayo and 1 egg.  I put the patties in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes.  This really helped to keep the patties together when cooking.

I served these on a hamburger bun with lettuce and 1000 island dressing.  YUM!

We love this recipe!  The flavor is great. I am still struggling with getting them the consistency that I like.  The center always stays a little mushy.  I tried adding some oatmeal with helped a little.  Seriously, if you can get over the consistency, you are in for a treat!

I think I prefer tuna burgers made with minced tuna steaks, but these were a good standby. I did them in the Foreman grill, and they stayed together really well. The flavor was a little bit bland, but we had them with sliced avocado, and wasabi mayo, so it didn't matter too much. Thanks!

These burgers were a big hit in my house! I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used porridge oats instead and this really helped to stop the burgers from falling apart when frying them. Another tip I found useful was to coat the burgers in flour before frying them which also helped keep them together. Delicious served in a bun with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.

I will not be making this burger again.  The consistency was mushy (even when cooked) and the flavors overpowered the tuna.  I realize this is a highly rated recipe...but readers with a more discriminating palate may want to think twice before making this dish.

I improvised a great deal with the recipe (due to lack of ingredients) and yet it still came out quite well. I used 1 can of tuna & 1 egg, mixed with 1/2 cup of crushed potato chips, liberal amount of dried onions, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, a tablespoon or so of chili garlic sauce, and a couple tablespoons of whipped cream cheese (to replace the mayonaise). I formed 4 small patties and cooked them on the george foreman grill sprayed with cooking spray. Served them with a bit of cocktail sauce (though ketchup would've been better). Quick and good recipe.

I followed the recipe almost exactly - except that I didn't have italian bread crumbs - just plain, so added my own seasonings to it (oregano, basil ect..).  I cooked on top of the stove as directed then put in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes as suggested in another review - while the patties came out a bit mushy - I think next time I will make more of an effort to dry the onions,peppers and celery more as I chopped them in a mini cuisinart.  I thought the seasonings were right on - I used Heinz chili sauce (found near the ketchup) and Tobasco for the pepper sauce. But we like things with a little kick. Thanks for the recipe.

I added the extra bread crumbs like others suggested, but it was just too smooshy inside.  It had a bad texture, and I couldn't even finish mine.

Very yummy recipe and cheap to make. I changed a few ingredients because I didn’t have some of the ingredients on  hand. Instead on onion I used horseradish sauce and  instead of chili sauce I used salsa. Who knew canned tuna could be so good!!

A great recipe. The secret is to add about another 1/3 cup of bread crumbs and to cook on low medium heat to make sure it cooks through and keeps the burger together. My family loved these burgers. We topped it with American cheese to make these Tuna Melt sandwiches. DELICIOUS and EASY!!

Very tasty!
I added some frozen corn and a little lemon juice. My husband and I enjoyed them more than our three small children, but I will continue to make these. Healthy and easy!

We really liked these tuna burgers.   I didn't find it hard to shape them because I used 2 cans of tuna. I refrigerated for 30 minutes and they weren't as delicate.  I used ketchup instead of chile sauce which I didn't have.  I also served with tarter sauce, tomato and lettuce on a bun.  Hubby said its a keeper!!

These tuna burgers are very simple to make and they taste wonderful. One can of tuna makes 4 good sized patties, and they are so good. Serve on hamburger rolls with lettuce and mayo and potato chips on the side. Excellent lunch or dinner!

Delicious! Loved it and ate it without the bun because I think the texture is closer to a crab cake than a burger. The next time I make it I may coat them with panko bread crumbs just before frying to get a bit of a crunch.

I was very limited on ingredients so I had to use this recipe as more of a guideline. My concoction actually turned out pretty good so I can't wait to see how darn tasty the original recipe is! I used the base of canned tuna, mayo, eggs, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and celery then I added parmesan cheese and dill weed based on a different recipe in an attempt to add some "zing". Unfortunately they were still missing the "zing" but a little yellow mustard on top worked well. I'll be sure to write another review when I make them the right way!!

One of my all-time favourite recipes! The only changes I made - I use a tbsp of Worcestershire and a tbsp of siracha as my hot pepper sauce, and occasionally will add tbsp or two more chili sauce. A bit of extra sauce but i still dont have any issues with managing the delicate patties. Absolutely delicious!! Love love this recipe!

I liked them a lot.  The only thing is you get either 4 small patties or 3 extra large patties.  Besides that they are delicious.

I browned some chopped chestnut mushroom with red onion and spinach and the cellery ,drained it  of  as much liquid as possible I then mixed this in with the tuna mixture and instead of using mayonaise  I used creme fraiche. I put it in the fridge to cool before making the patties. I  had more mixture than for four patties so i put the rest  in the  freezer. Nice thank you.

The only change I made was to omit the celery (didn't  have any)and to use chili paste instead of chili sauce.( once again, no chili sauce) I used another reviewers tip to use a Foreman grill. They were awesome. I ate 2 of them no bun or condiments with some sliced up avocado. Delicious.

I made this this evening my husband and family loved it I added  a little more spicy Chile sauce and used sweet Chile sauce and also made spicy mayo to top it this tuna patty really needs to be served the second it's pulled from the grill to get the full effect I also added extra breadcrumbs to the outside of the party for extra crunch and used Panko italian bread crumbs it was really good.I did use a bit of oil which I think really made the dish thanks!We'll be making it again.Salmon could actually go well here too I think.I also used a lot more tuna.

I loved this recipe but I did make some changes:
I put everything in a food processor which made the burger super melt-in-your mouth. I didn't have any of the sauces mentioned on hand so I left them out which worked fine. I used  chili pepper, instead. To make it healthier I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo. I also threw in cumin, smoked paprika, and a little finely chopped jalapeno for some kick. I didn't have celery so I used 1/3 cup corn instead. I used crackers for the breadcrumbs and because it still looked moist after the 1/2 cup I added but I was out of crackers I added in some rolled oats. I refrigerated for about 30 minutes. Just before cooking I mixed in some fresh cilantro. Next time I will puree everything together except for the onions, corn, and bell peppers (If I use them) to add a little texture.

Added a bunch of different spices and left some out, fell apart in the pan and looked like scrambled eggs, but it was delicious on toast and I will probably make it again.

It was ok. I would place it as about as good as something I would get from fast food - inoffensive, but not delicious. Probably wouldn't serve this to guests.

On the upside, this is crazy cheap while remaining fairly healthy. Priced this out to (roughly) $2.5/2 burgers, which is about enough for someone to feel satisfied. I'm guessing you can go cheaper if you buy in bulk/shop deals, which I generally don't. Definitely recommended over some of the other fallbacks for saving money (mac & cheese, etc).

Awesome! I admit, I checked the reviews first. I took the advice and used green onions instead of onions. I also swapped red bell pepper for sundried tomatoes. I would have used roasted red bell pepper if I could have. All in all, awesome! I kept the rest of the recipe intact. The chili sauce really makes it! Thank you for the great recipe!

These were awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with the Jalepeno-cilantro Aioli from this site. Both myself and my husband were thrilled with it!

Good recipe and flexible enough that you can leave out or substitute some of the spices and veggies and still have it be tasty.

Good flavor and I don't mind somewhat mushy Tuna burgers. I added garlic and diced roasted Poblano peppers to go w/ 'chili sauce' and Tabasco and black pepper. Also added some diced fresh Rosemary leaves with the dried Dill Weed. Perfect aftertaste...not so hot to make you wish you hadn't and yet spicy enough to be glad you did. I used Wild Planet canned Albacore...good stuff.

These were really yummy, easy and cheap! I love this recipe and will definitely make it again. I put my patties in my George Foreman grill like an other reviewer and not having to flip them they came out perfect. Thanks :-)

These are an excellent diversion from the usual uses of a can of tuna. I didn't have chili sauce so substituted ketchup and a tsp of Emeril's essence. Also added some jerk seasoning per other reviews I've read. Didn't have celery so used celery salt instead. I used an albacore tuna which is dryer than some canned types and had no problems with soft patties. Delicious.

My husband loved them!!! I doubled the recipe & followed it exactly except I used canned rotel to put on top of the burgers & I didn't double the onions since the hubby is not a fan of them. I also lightly toasted the buns. 
The burgers turned out great! I made 4 tonight & had enough mixture left 2 make at 3 more....but a couple of mine were pretty big. 
We had them with potato salad as suggested in one of the menus on this site.

I made this two nights in a row. The first night I used regular tuna and it was good, but the second night I used a spiced tune and it was excellent. My husband really enjoyed it. I did without the chili sauce, red bell pepper, and hot pepper sauce.

These are fantastic! We add a little more dill, red peppers, onions, and celery but it is delicious as is. We also like to "over brown" our patties, it gives them a nice carmalized flavor and added texture.

 If your trying to lose weight, like many of us are, you can serve it on half a bun -70cal or skip the bun all together -140cal

I share this recipe with others, more than any other recipe I have tried on here

I love this recipe! My family loves tuna but it can be so boring if made the same way.  I made these last week and have been craving them since.  Even my picky 5 year old ate it :)  It was a big hit. Thanks!!

I needed ideas on what to cook for my family on Friday's during Lent.  I am so glad I found this recipe!!!  It is delicious.  The only changes I made were I used 1 shallot instead of onion and panko breadcrumbs, because that's what I had on hand.  I served it with tartar sauce on sesame buns....yummy!!

Made 6 large burgers with 10oz tuna + 2 eggs. The rest of the ingredients I didn't measure :) Didn't have bell peppers so threw in some frozen chopped broccoli. Yes they were delicate but I was careful not to turn them too soon and they all held together. Went over well and enjoyed the 6th 'extra' one cold for lunch today. This recipe is a keeper for me.

Very good recipe!  I had to omit the chili sauce because I didn't have any, same with the dill.  I added in minced green pepper also just to get rid of it. And added some garlic powder and lawrys season salt to try to make up for flavor loss of no chili sauce.  Even though I had to change the recipe out of necessity this is a very good recipe!  Only my 14 y/o son didnt like it because he doesnt like any fish.  The rest of us found this very interesting and tasty.  Served them on toasted buns.

EXCELLENT!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was so yummy.  I put it on a whole wheat bun with lettuce & tomato.  Hubby added mayo to the bun.  It is just the right amount of spice.  You won't be dissapointed.

This was VERY good. I mixed some cilantro and left out the celery and bell pepper. When i cooked them they didn't even smell like tune which is good. =D definitely going to make this again.

These tasted great!  I used flaked salmon instead of tuna.  The only bad part was that they were so crumbly, I would still make them again because the flavor was so good!

These are quite delicious! I increased the bread crumbs (panko, not italian seasoned) to 3/4 cup; omitted celery (didn't have it but will use it next time); used albacore white tuna packed in water; and substituted minced shallot for the onion. I minced the red pepper pretty finely. After I mixed everything I refrigerated the mixture for an hour or two, and then formed it into patties and cooked them in a non-stick frying pan until they were browned on both sides and heated through. I served them on toasted buns with a little more mayonnaise. Really great way to serve tuna! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These are delicious!  I found the mixture came out dry, rather than too squishy.  (Might have been the size of the egg that I used.  Or the size of the can of tuna.)  They were easy to press together, and held together well while frying.  I left out the red pepper, used a shallot instead of an onion, and used a dash of sriracha chili sauce.  Super-easy, super-yum.

Made several changes for flavor, but loved it. 2 can's of tuna 1 egg white & 1 whole egg 1 bunch of green onion & 1T of dried minced onion.  1Cup breadcrumbs 1/4cup chili sauce & 1/3cup light miracle whip 1/3 cup diced green pepper & celery Extra hot sauce Replaced black pepper w/ Cayenne  Very good little burgers, whoever said it's like a crab cake is right.  These reminded me of a crab cake slider but w/ Tuna.

Best tuna burger I've found (so far). These are very moist before cooking and difficult to keep together but it can be done. I made this as written (except that I doubled it). Awesome. Will be making it again for sure.

I probably shouldn't be ranking this because I changed the recipe so much based on what I had in the house. That said, I wanted to put in a good word.  The Italian bread crumbs made it not taste like tuna, which in my house is a very good thing.  I put in just enough sour cream (in lieu of mayo) to hold them together well, so I didn't have any problems with the burgers falling apart.

Excellent recipe & very tasty. I altered it to use what I had on hand. Used 2/3 cup of Panko crumbs to help the patties hold together a little better. Didn't have dill so I used parsley instead. Used 2 rounded tsp homemade salsa in place of the chili sauce & hot sauce. To lighten it up I used low fat mayo & 1/4 cup of egg beaters in place of the egg. In the end the celery was a little strong, but still very tasty. Will definately make again.

Wow, surprisingly good! Loved the color and crunch from all the veggies. I was out of dill so made without, and thought they were wonderful. The chili sauce really made this special, with that sweet-hot flavor. I'll make these often.

These are a wonderful alternative to regular old tuna! I didn't have on hand lots of the ingredients, but the burgers still tasted great. Putting them in the fridge for 30 minutes was a perfect idea; they really were easy to handle! I plan to make these often. I actually used them in a salad-- I cut the burgers up in pieces and tossed them in with the lettuce. It was very good!

These are really good. For another option, try putting the burger on a salad instead of on a bun! Kind of like a grilled chicken salad but a grilled tuna burger salad instead!

i was out of dill so i used some spicy creole seasoning and coated them in extra bread crumbs. these were perfect to use up some homemade buns from the freezer. i melted american cheese on mine, topped w/ spicy panini sauce and served with crispy potato wedges(both from this site). i refrigerated the mixture so they satyed together while cooking but they fell apart once we ate them. cant wait to try these in the oven next time.

good cheap dish. great w/ a dill sauce & lettuce & cheese on a bun! usually if you have falling apart problems, just add a bit more bread crums. or stick in the frezer for about 20 mins

Although I am not a huge tuna fan, I wanted to try something a little different and needed a quick meal.  My husband enjoyed these and I thought they were decent.  I cooked them on the Foreman grill out of pure laziness.  They were obviously softer than your normal beef burger but held together just fine.

These were very tasty, but mine were too soggy and fell apart.  Next time I think I'd decrease the Mayo and increase the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup.  Also, I added a grated carrot for some extra veggies.  Good enough to try again, hopefully they'll come out a bit firmer next time.

Very delicious!!  I only had Panko flakes, so I used those instead of Italian bread crumbs, and they turned out amazing.  Freezing for a few minutes definitely helps handling the patties.

My husband really liked these.  I thought they were pretty good, but could have used a tad more chili/pepper sauce for a bit more spice!  I skipped on the Worcestershire because I didn't have any, but I think these probably turned out equally well without it.

I have been looking for healthier alternatives to beef burgers so I thought I would give this a try. The only change I made was to use 2 cans of tuna instead of 1. These were ok in texture and I liked the addition of the veggies but they weren't as "wow" in taste as I had hoped. If I make these again I will alter the flavorings to give them more taste.

Really enjoyed this recipe! My extremely picky 10yr old had 3!! I modified a bit due to what I had on hand... I used 2 cans of tuna(feeding fam of 5), 3/4c of plain breadcrumbs(homemade from stale bread), no red pepper but grated some carrot, ketchup for chili sauce, extra hot sauce and no dill. Made the patties small and thin, "slider" style. Served with mustard, pickles and lettuce.

These turned out pretty well. I left out the dill and worcestershire sauce (didnt have any on hand) and were just fine.  My semi-picky kids did not like them very much though.

I made several changes to this recipe, mainly because I didn’t have all of the ingredients.  However, I omitted the dill and red pepper based on reviewers’ suggestions and used two cans of tuna, which resulted in approximately 5 hamburger-sized patties.  I did not refrigerate for 30 minutes as suggested, but added approximately ¾ c. Italian breadcrumbs and had no problem with the patties falling apart.  To compensate for my lack of chili sauce, I added a generous amount (3/4 T.) chili powder, extra hot sauce, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also added one clove of minced garlic and some garlic powder (I love garlic).  I used red onion and approximately ½ t. celery seed since this was the closest I could come to the real thing.  To reduce calories, I used light mayo.  I served these on hamburger buns with tartar sauce and made French fries and green beans as side dishes.  When I tried a piece of the tuna burger by itself though, I was amazed.  These patties are so good that you do not need buns.  These would be phenomenal served by themselves with rice or a potato and a green vegetable.

These were not good at all!  I made them and followed the recipe exactly except omitted the celery because I didn't have any, and I thought because of all of the high rating it would be worth a try.  I like to try new things, but this I will not be making again. YuK!

These burgers are a hit every time I make them. A unique way to dress up plain old tuna into a gourmet burger! I like to use Sriracha/rooster sauce for chili sauce. Definitely a keeper.

My family loved this recipe - my husband asked if we could have it again tomorrow night. :) I used my Hamilton Grill so I wouldn't have to flip the patties and they turned out perfect.

These were very tasty! I did make a few changes...I used green onion, no celery, but added some shredded carrot. No chili sauce because I didnt have any, and no dill, but used some Old Bay. Also I didnt use any hot sauce because I dont like spicy. They turned out really good! Im trying to cut back on red meat, so when I make my family hamburgers Ill just make myself these!

This was yummy!  I also used 3/4 cup bread crumbs and added some extra seasonings, as I didn't have chili sauce.  I added 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp curry, 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning.  They were very similar to crabcakes and I mixed some mayo and spicy mustard at the last minute for dipping sauce.

Pretty simple to make but I found it to be pretty plain. To spice it up a bit I whipped up some of the wasabi mayo recipe I found on here, very good together.

Very tasty!  I haven't had fish/seafood in several months and decided to have a go at making a tuna burger.  This fit the bill nicely.  I had no issues with the mixture being too dry or crumbly.  I refrigerated it for approximately 25 minutes.  I added more than just a dash of worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce.  Omitted the dill as it's not a favorite.  I topped with a mix of light sour cream, catsup and mustard. Recipe is very adaptable to one's own liking - I used a tip from another reviewer and cooked these on my George Foreman grill.  Very quick, very easy, minimal clean-up. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I have made this many times and we love it. The only thing I do differently is that I use two cans of tuna, although I think next time I make them I will add some garlic and Old Bay as others have suggested.  If it seems kind of dry I add a little more of the other ingredients.  The only thing I ever use a recipe for is a guide, anyway. The chili sauce is pretty self-explanitary, the bottle says "Chili Sauce" on it so there should be no confusion as to what she's talking about. I do like the idea of cocktail sauce though, that is a thought for next time.  I serve mine on buns with swiss cheese, lettuce, dijon mustard and a little Miracle Whip.

We opted to sauté all vegetables (including the addition of a minced garlic clove)before adding to tuna mixture.  The recipe only needed 3T. mayo.  We substituted cocktail sauce for chili sauce & as others suggested, added ¼ tsp Old Bay.  These were really quite good.   Addition:  Do as the submitter suggests.  Stick burgers in refrigerator for ½ hr. They’re much easier to handle.

This recipe is fantastic. I make it every now and then for Friday night seafood. Not a single complaint. I do omit the chili sauce and celery. Great stand by for what you have in the cabinets.

This wasn't bad.  If I could have, I would have given this a solid 3.5 stars.  I didn't have a problem with the burgers being mushy inside (I did take earlier advice and made the patties on the thinnish side).  The taste wasn't bad but I don't think it makes the regular rotation.  I'll keep the recipe but will only use it on occasion when I'm in the mood for tuna but not a tuna salad or casserole.  Can't rave about it but can't complain.

My husband always says no to tuna sandwich, but today I managed to convince him to try this and he said it's good! I didn't form the tuna into a burger, so I used all the ingredients except bread crumbs. It is tasty!

Honestly, when I made these I wasn't sure what to expect, but they were surprisingly good!  Since I was in need of a trip to the grocery store, I didn't have lettuce or tomato on hand, which I definitely think it needed.  Will make again for sure!

LOVE this recipe! It was pretty spicy, but I love spicy food so I loved it (I also added more than 1 dash of Tabasco!). Great without a bun, with a side of carrot sticks, celery sticks, and red pepper slices. Will definitely make again.

Made a few changes.  I doubled on the tuna and bread crumbs and omitted the chili sauce and wor. sauce.  These were absolutly delicious.  I served them on a wheat kaiser with a slice of provolone cheese melted on top,Sweer hot peppers with lettuce on the bun, and a side  with steamed asparagus.  Def a keeper!

My family is very picky, but they LOVE these burgers. My kids are 5, 3, and 1.5, and they all devour them. I make them as the recipe is written, but leaving out a few of the veggies, and they are always a big hit.

I was looking for something different to do with tuna and came across this recipe.  I made them with what I had on hand, so there were several changes - regular breadcrumbs (heaping 1/2 c., as suggested by others), dehydrated minced onion, no celery, ketchup instead of chili sauce, and no dill weed.  Even with all these substitutions, they were fantastic!  I put Miracle Whip on mine and my boyfriend used hot sauce.  I think tartar sauce would also be good.

In searching for healthier meal ideas I ran across this recipe. I made the mistake of doubling it and between a family of 4 only 1/2 a "burger" was consumed. The rest went to the dog. I've made some OUTRAGEOUS dishes trying to expand our horizons and some have been downright awful. However, these are the worst by far! Our non-picky family found these to be completely inedible. Try at your own risk!

These are absolutely delicious! I served them with thousand island sauce and they were great. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Update: I wanted to make these again this week but didn't have all the ingredients. Omitted the bell pepper, celery and dill which I didn't have, and added 1 teaspoon cajun spice. This time I served them with mango chutney mayo (mango chutney, mayonnaise, lemon juice, curry, salt), and it turned out just as wonderful!

Very yummy! i used half crushed dill pickle potato chips and half bread crumbs.  I also ommitted the worcestershire sauce as i didn't have any, and used a dash of chili powder instead of sauce.  Just fried them up and ate with ketchup!  yummy!

We liked these quite a bit.  I served these more like crab cakes, with french fries and tartar sauce. I'm allergic to shellfish, so I don't know what a crab cake tastes like, but I liked this and my husband said it was a good substitute. The next time I served them as burgers and they were good that way too. The only reason they got a 4 instead of a 5 is that they're pretty time intensive and I don't make them very often because of it.

Good recipe! My kids and I enjoyed it. It is tricky to know whether the egg is cooked through, but I wasn't too worried. I like the assortment of tastes together. I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs as it was one of those nights where the pantry is fairly empty and you are looking for some magic to make with a can of tuna. I used cornflakes crushed instead.

Horrible! I followed the recipe exactly buying everything I did'nt have in advance. The taste was bad and the consistency is terrible. I do like crab cakes but not this! I would not recommend this to anyone!

These weren't bad, but I wasn't crazy about them. My family liked them. I played around a little w/ the ingredients since I was missing a few. I only had plain bread crumbs, so I made my own flavored bread crumbs by adding in dried Italian spices & some hot paprika. Also, I didn't have chilli sauce & I think they would have come out better had I used it. Instead I put in some extra dashes of hot paprika. I don't exactly know what chilli sauce is. I assumed it was similar to a BBQ sauce. Maybe someone can clarify what it is, since I noticed a lot of people didn't know. I skipped the dill weed since I'm not a big dill fan. I also added in a little soy sauce in place of the Worcestershire. I don't know if it's fair for me to be rating this recipe, since I made so many alterations. I'm sure it comes out better if you have all the necessary ingredients on hand (the chilli sauce in particular). Mine did not fall apart in the pan. Instead of eating ours on buns, we ate ours w/ some plain yogurt (sour cream works too). With the yogurt I'd up them 4 stars. Maybe I'll try them again w/ the chilli sauce (once I figure out what exactly that is). Thanks!

These were quite good; I served them more like crab cakes - no bun, lettuce or tomato - with fries and fresh green beans on the side.  I also added half a slice of american cheese to each patty.  I will make these again!

I hadn't read the reviews before making this and ended up using less bread crumbs than the recipe called for.  The patties held together just fine, although I didn't add any celery or bell pepper.  Very good overall with a little tartar sauce on the bun.

Followed recipe as instructed except for adding cheese on top. The only flavor that stood out was the Italian bread crumbs. Seemed very bland.

I thought these were great!  I left out the green peppers and chili sauce because I have small children, so I didn't want it to be too spicy - and used dried minced onion and celery seed to save time.  I also increased the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup so the burgers would hold together better.  My kids and I loved them!!  We are having this for dinner again tonight to try out on my husband!  Thanks for a different spin on tuna!

They were pretty good, didn't taste bland at all but wouldn't have been good without the cheese that I melted on top. Still prefer tuna mixed with just mayo on homemade buns. Thanks anyways.

I’m obviously in the minority since these did nothing for me. I used good quality Tuna, followed the recipe exactly and the result was bland and boring. I like the potential for this combination of ingredients (except for the Tuna) and will try this again, substituting canned chicken to see if that combo works better for my taste buds.

Not that great. It was bland. Even added melted cheese but didn't help. I added extra bread crumb as suggested by others here and it helped holding the patties together but the flavor was overpowering. Will not make it again.

I had some reservations about these, and I should have listened to myself! My fiance thought they were OK, but I couldn't even finish mine. They are mushy and way too heavy on the breadcrumbs, despite me following the recipe exactly. Too little tuna as well.

I didn't have any tuna in the house, so I substituted canned chicken. I also added some tabasco sauce and substituted hoisin sauce for the teriyaki. These were simple and tasty, but nothing too spectacular.  Next time I will try with some peppers to add more zing!
