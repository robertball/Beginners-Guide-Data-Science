My hubby really liked this.  The only reason that I did not give this 5 stars is that the sauce is quite runny.  I had to let it simmer for quite some time in order to get a sauce that would stick to the chicken.   This is a very easy and convenient recipe and in a push I would make this for my hubby again.

it is very good, however i cut up a small green pepper and added it. also the sauce is to thin, so i added a little corn starch to thicken it. the corn starch is what it needed!

Hubby and I really enjoyed this, having it again tonight. We have ours with rice. The sauce works better with it. Baking some garlic bread to go with it. I would recommend it. I do think I simmered it a little longer as well.

I had to change a few things like the type of spaghetti sauce (I used Primo- Original) and full Chicken Thighs bone-in. Then baked it in the oven at 350f for one and a half hours. It turned out so good, I will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this. I started my sauce first and did cook it for 30 minutes or so.

I have tried this with thighs and with breasts. Prefer the breasts.

I added green pepper and onion as well as a little red pepper for some kick.
