Delicious. I have popsicle moulds but use them for juice or coffee pops--never thought of using coconut milk. What a great idea! I had one lone clementine that no one wanted to eat so I used its juice in addition to orange juice (to make one cup total). Also added some specks of pulp for appearance and extra yumminess.

I used vanilla quinoa milk, oj and honey and skipped the coconut milk and vanilla. I have another recipe for Popsicles that I use coconut milk in. Simple. Gotta love it.
