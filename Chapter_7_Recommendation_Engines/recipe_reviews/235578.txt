I added orange zest from half an orange but otherwise stayed true to the recipe until I tasted it. I found it to be way too sour--maybe too much vinegar?--so I added two more tablespoons of brown sugar. I'll be serving it as a topping for goat cheese tarts. I'll be mixing in honey to the goat cheese so I don't want to go overboard on the sweet, but I may be adding more sugar when I can taste the whole ensemble. I can barely detect the chili or ginger, so I also think you could increase both ingredients if you want some kick.
