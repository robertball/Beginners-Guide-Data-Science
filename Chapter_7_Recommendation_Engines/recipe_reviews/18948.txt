I did as someone else mentioned and used less water. To make a gallon, use 1 c. lime juice, 1 c. sugar and 1 gallon water. Could add cherry juice or Koolaid to add another flavor.

I think this would also be too weak.  I used 6 limes, 1/2c sugar, and add water to make 2 quarts, and it wasn't bad.  Next time, I'd probably use 8 limes, and maybe a little more sugar.  I like mine not too sweet... it seem as 'refreshing' to me.

Bad recipe - it came out too watery. Be sure to taste as you're adding the sugar water.

This is in fact a very REFRESHING beverage recipe. I used half sugar and half splenda granular and it turned out great. Perfect drink for a hot summer day or just after a workout. To garnish I froze pieces of flat leaf parsley in ice cube trays with water and added a couple to each glass. Great recipe light and refreshing not too sweet.

This recipe turned out okay but I wish that instead of listing a number of limes, the author had mentioned a measurement of lime juice. I used about 20 small limes and it was too weak. I recommend using half the amount of water and then tasting it to see if more is needed.

Perfect, made with 2/3 cup Splenda rather than sugar. I think maybe some people don't realize that all limes are different, you may have to adjust the sweetner or add more water. This is just GREAT. My 12 year old made this for us!

Way too weak.  We used the same amount of sugar and 15 limes for 2 quarts of water, and it was good.

Good recipe!!  I added ice becuase in my own drink because i like it nice and cold.  Not too sweet and good amounts of lime and sugar.  Just a little bit watery for people who like it sweeter though.

This was a fantastically refreshing adult limeade.  I served it with my special egg salad on croissants for a light meal since the weather here is quite warm.  One might consider adding their favorite vodka or tequila for a unique cocktail.

I agree that people must not be juicing their limes.  I had to strong arm the little limes on my juicing bowl and this recipe came out great using only 3 limes.  It was very light and refreshing.  Then I put in one extra lime to see the difference and that sent my 3 year old daughter over the edge to a sour face.  So use your elbow and juice those limes for a nice, refreshing summer drink!

oh my goodness!!! really great! I made some changes though.... used 6 limes(about 3 medium sized and 3 smaller), and alittle less than 1/2 cup sugar. I like mine tart. Turned out just like I wanted it to! I hate to drink water and now I found something I can do to use limes!! Thanks!

I halved the recipe because I didn't know if I'd like it and used 2 limes, 1/3 C sugar and 4 C water.  It was really good, not too sweet and very crisp and refreshing.  I wouldn't care for it if it was any stronger and I prefer this over lemonade.

This recipe was a little weak so I played around with it: instead, use a lemon-lime seltzer water and lime zest for boosted flavor.  Refreshing.

Instead of squeezing the limes I highly recommend throwing 3 WHOLE limes with peels and all in a juicer. I have an Omega juicer and it's perfect. You'll get WAY more juice out of each lime that way. Using a juicer makes all the difference in the world!! You can make lemonade the same way. After you get the lime or lemon juice using your juicer pour it into a pitcher of cold water with whatever sweetener you'd like. Keep tasting it till you get it the way you'd like. I make this almost every day.

Those who think this makes a "weak" limeade are probably not using juicy limes.  Sweet, refreshing, perfect!

This is too weak. Follow this recipe, 1.5-2 cups of fresh squeezed lime juice, 2 cups of sugar syrup*, and 3 cups of water. 

*Bring 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a boil while stirring continuously. Reduce heat and continue to stir until sugar dissolves completely. This should yield 2 cups of the syrup.

I doubled the recipe, added 2 cups splenda and an additional 2/3 cup sugar and 3 limes.  Came out fine then.  Very weak, so make sure to have extra limes and sugar on hand.  I also put some rosemary in to give it an extra taste.

I used 12 small lemon-sized limes and it still wasn't enough. If I can find limes this large again, I'll try it with 15 or more next time. I don't think this is a very good recipe as written.

Not a great recipe.  I ended up using 6 big juicy limes to one cup sugar for 2 quarts of water.  It just really depends on the juiciness of the fruit.  If this had an exact measured amount of lime juice it would come out perfect every time.  But it's not that hard to make limeade, just taste as you go along, it'll be great!

I am very surprised! After reading the reviews I was a little worried how this would turn out, but it turned out great. We had small limes so we used 5 of them, 2/3 cup of sugar and maybe a little over a quart of water! Remember them more water you use the more diluted the lime flavor will be. Enjoy!

pretty good, sweetness was about right. I doubled the recipe. However, I would add maybe 3 or 4 limes to the 6 i used, rather weak in lime flavor.

mix with club soda (aka seltzer water)and also add a pinch of salt, limeade will give lemonade a run for its name.

Very subtle with a clean taste, if that makes sense. Yes, I know it's not a wine =) My next batch I used Splenda and doubled the limes, that was more to my liking, a little more tart.

This recipe is not limey enough for my family.  We really like Simply Limeade, and this does not have the lime flavor.  I put in over a cup of lime and left everything else the same.  Next time, I might do half the water and sugar and add the cup of lime juice.

I had two unusually big and juicy limes so I got all the juice possible out of them, which was 1/2 cup. I combined 1/3 cup sugar with 1 cup water and boiled the sugar water for 30 seconds, then let it cool. I combined the sugar syrup with the 1/2 cup lime juice, and then 3 1/2 cups cold water. This was a little tart but just wonderful! When a recipe just lists the number of citrus fruits, you could get such a wide variety in yield. I'd rather see the quantity of juice and maybe a suggestion of how many limes or lemons it took to get that.

Terrific, thank you.
Suggestion: For any whose limes ended up making a brownish drink, add a smallest-possible drop of green food coloring to the 2-quart pitcher and jazz up the color a bit.

I too made some changes. I used 9 limes (to make about a cup of lime juice), about 3/4 cup of sugar, and 2 quarts of cold water. It isn't too sweet and is very refreshing.

I made this on an extremely hot and humid day and it so cool and refreshing.  My husband called it "air conditioning in a glass"  Terrific recipe and quick to make.

This recipe is hard to rate, since the actual lime juice to sugar ration isn't given.  We had some pretty juicy limes and went with a 1.5:1 juice/sugar ratio and added water to taste, which turned out great.  So points off the recipe for not being more specific, but some points for the basic concept.  Allrecipes, you would do well to update this recipe!

Very good! This is my first time making homemade limeade, so I don't have anything to compare it to other than it is much nicer than storebought.

We really liked  as is, which is why we gave it a 4 star.  For our second batch, we threw in a couple strawberries, and made a change in the water. Instead, we used 1 quart water and 1 cup ice, and threw it all in a blender. Loved it!

Made this exactly to recipe.  I'm not a fan of limemade, so my husband pre-tested to make sure it was satisfactory.  He said it was good, but a little sugary.  It was gone by the end of lunch.  Something that my mother-in-law and daughter did was add frozen mixed berries to their drinks and it looked nice, as well as a added a new flavor.
