I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't use peppers or onions and I only used half a cabbage. I cut the cabbage in wedges and then peeled the layers apart and put it in a zip lock bag. Then I melted the 1/4 cup of butter and put two cloves of minced garlic in the butter and poured it over the cabbage and shook the bag to coat it. Then I wrapped the cabbage in the foil and grilled 40 minutes. It was delicious!

I liked it, but the family said it was just ok. I found wedges didn't work that well, since it's hard to coat spices all over and the center was still crunchy. I'd chop it up like a salad & wrap it up that way.

This was delish!! Such a change from boiled and fried cabbage.  It takes on the characterstics of fried cabbage though, just somewhat healthier.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding grated parmasean cheese, it added a wonderful flavor to it.  I also did not turn my cabbage for fear that the butter would run out and ruin my new grill lol...but i think it turned out great because it left a very charred outer layer that was very good. Thanks for posting. I could almost ate a half a head of cabbage tonight!!

Chop in large pieces rather than wedges.  Cook for 45-50 minutes.  Use olive oil, not butter.  Add extra spices.  Add brats to grill for final 10 minutes.  Serve with roasted potatoes and dark beer.

UPDATE:  I just made this again last night and I am still amazed at how good it turns out and how easy it is.  I left out the bell pepper this time but it was just as good.  Thank you again for the recipe it is awesome!   I am giving this recipe 5 stars for flavor, innovation and ease! We love fried and boiled cabbage but never thought of putting it on the grill.  I added 1/4 cup butter and also some olive oil,celeryt seed and plenty of fresh ground pepper.  I made 2, one with the green pepper and one without.  I also added some cooked crumbled bacon.  Both were really good.  Thanks for sharing! it was a hit and good the second day too (for what little was left).

This was delicious. I have a skillet made for the grill that is has a bunch of holes throughout (google bbq skillet). It's great for grilling small veggies that would otherwise fall through. The holes allow for a nice char and grill taste. I sliced the cabbage, used red bell pepper and added more garlic, sliced. Great the next day in my lunch too!

I had some leftover cabbage and thought I would give this a try. I was very reluctant though. To our surprise we loved it. I bought a new head of cabbage just to make this again!

With more garlic, this recipe is 5 stars *****.  I only used a quarter of a head of cabbage, but used three cloves of garlic.  PERFECT.  Nutritious & delicious!

Loved the flavours & easy to make.  Instead of foil, I use 2 aluminum (disposable) containers and hold  together with foldback clips.  I find them easier to flip &/or check when they are done. I like my green peppers cooked less (they were abit mushy) so next time I will add them part way through cooking.

I liked this...especially the convenience of cooking it on the grill while you're already grilling. But will try it with a few more spices next time.

This is really good. I cut the the cabbage into large pieces rather than leave it in wedges & use olive oil instead of butter. I mix up the veggies, garlic, salt, pepper & olive oil in a large bowl then pour it onto a large piece of foil sprayed with cooking spray. I cook the large foil packet over medium heat on my gas grill for 40 mins. So far I've made this twice, the first time as I stated above, the second time I added 18 oz cooked Italian sausage to the foil packet & it was very, very tasty! Will keep this in our rotation. Thanks!

Three times in a week (I bought 2 heads of cabbage so I grilled it 3 tiimes). Great Great Great. This third time I spread the butter on then pressed garlic, pepper, onions and peppers. It was great because the smell was outside.

Oh my word!!  I am not a cabbage fan, in fact, I think I can safely say I've never eaten that much cabbage in one setting.  It definitely needed more garlic, I put in a tablespoon of the preminced stuff.  It was sooooo good!

It's ok. like another review I read it tastes like good cabbage. I think next time I'm going to add more garlic. It also tastes pretty good if you put a little soy sauce on it.

Good recipe but it takes a lot longer to cook than the recipe says.  I also used a whole stick of butter, not 1/4 of a cup.

This was prett good.  Next time I might use a little more butter.  My husband, who hates anything green that grows, said this was "Definately edible."  Now that's the highest praise you can ask for!

I had expected something out-of-this-world because of all the high ratings this recipe got, but I'd say I just got some good cabbage. The cabbage tasted like cabbage, which I liked, but it wasn't anything mindblowing. I might make again because it's healthy, but I don't see myself craving this or dreaming about it or anything like that. :)

This is funny I had basically the same grilled cabbage I concocked last summer! I used papricka, pepper salt and a Mrs. Dash for spices than i used green red yellow and orange pepper with butter in the cabbage wedges. You can use little or as much different additives as you want a very flexible recipe!

We love this cabbage and I made one change. I cooked it at 400 deg. F in the oven for 45 minutes. We use our rating system around here. I gave it a 10 and she gave it a 9 and when I asked her why she said only because you made IT!

I should have read the reviews first...it was a bit bland.  Next time I try this, I will add more garlic and spice.  Definitely better than boiled cabbage though!
