Like Mel, I used 4 eggs and 1 cup milk.  Because of that, I increased the brown mustard to 1 tsp.  I chose colby cheese. The most significant thing I did that added flavor was to use leftover chicken that was baked with lemon and garlic--I even chopped and tossed in the clove of garlic that was baked with the whole chicken.  It turned out great--five out of five family members liked it, including the one who wrinkled her nose before the first bite.  The only problem was that it was watery and that made the crust a little soggy.  Anyone know where the liquid came from and how to correct that?  Even so, this is a keeper.

As I was making this, I wanted to add some broccoli and mushrooms, but resisted and made it as written.  Having tasted it, I still think it would be better with a vegetable and some mushrooms in it, and probably more mustard and cheese.  It's good, but it could be better.  I used a regular size pie plate and crust, and it didn't fill it, so there is room for more ingredients.

WOW!  This recipe was excellent!!!!!  I knew before I even  finished preparing that it was going to be great!  The aroma was wonderful!  I did add just a little more chicken (1/2 cup) to make it a little more hearty and I only added 6oz of swiss so I would have the opportunity to add a good sprinkle of parmesan, ramono and mozzerlla.  I LOVE cheese and all these go well together.  I highly recommend this quiche.  My husband isn't big on quiche because he says it's not "meat and potatoes", he really like this one and he's also the reason for the addition in chicken.  Thanks Shannonlia for such a great dish!

I decided to use some of the other suggestions when I made this plus I added one change of my own.  I did not have a deep-dish pastry shell.  I had the pillbury crust you unroll and put in a glass pie plate, so I used 3 X-Lg eggs and the 1 cup milk.  I also added salt and fresh ground black pepper.  I decided to address the blandness by adding 4 strips of crumbled bacon to the chicken mixture.  I still thought it needed a little more flavor.  Next time I will try adding part cheddar and part swiss cheese, more onion and maybe a dash of worcestershire.

This recipe was bland for my husband and I.  I did add 1 tsp salt and also needed to add 2 more eggs and 1/2 C milk to fill my deep dish pie pan.  It needed a vegie for color and to cut the richness.  Perhaps a little diced red pepper or some peas?

I added 2 extra eggs (Thanks Mel) and used mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Also used a bit more mustard and some salt and pepper.  Turned out really well.  Had to cook more like 60 or 65 minutes with the extra eggs.  Tasty!

I used 1 1/2 cups of swiss cheese.  Also, I added a spoonful of cranberry sauce on top of each slice os quiche, which gave the dish a little extra flavor.

All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!! This way amazingly delicious. My husband and I loved it. I did add 2 cups shredded swiss cheese and might add a little less onion next time. But oh so good. Will definitely make again.

A quick and easy quiche to put together if you already have cooked chicken.  This is a keeper for me!  The pecans are like the icing on the cake.

I made this for lunch today. I thought it was ok but rather bland - I had even added some s&p and garlic powder - but my friend thought it was delicious. She ended up taking the left-overs home. Thanks!

This is pretty good quiche. I made a few adjustments to taste, 3 eggs, 3/4 C milk, caramelized onions and rosemary.  Here's my own personal feeling, too much chicken. I like my quiche with lots of veggies, and I found this one to be too meaty. Next time I will adjust the chicken and nuts and possibly add tomatoes or broccoli.  Overall it is good and easy to make.

it was ok, but needed more ingredients.  Some veggies as others have mentioned.  I would also saute the onions before adding.

This was delicious.  This was also my first time making a quiche.  I did not use swiss and I can understand the reviews saying it didn't have enough flavor if they used swiss.  I would definitely recommend using a stronger flavored cheese for anyone with concerns.  I used cheddar jack.  I did have to make some adjustments to make it fill up my pie pan enough (hence the 4 stars).  I did not think I had a deep dish pie pan, but this did not fill it up anywhere near enough.  Overall I ended up with 4 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk (and probably could have used a bit more).  I eagerly ate mine with cranberry sauce which made it feel like thanksgiving, and my dh plopped on a whole bunch of sour cream on his. My 7-year-old ate his plain and we all loved it.

This turned out quite good, if a little on the bland side. I made my own crust and prebaked it in a hot oven about ten minutes, then lined it with slices of Swiss cheese before filling. This kept the bottom crust from getting soggy. I used shredded cheddar in the recipe itself. I was worried the filling would be more than would fit in my pie plate and skimped on the milk (I think I reduced it by about 1/4 c), but as it happened I had plenty of room. I also added a little bit of leftover broccoli, chopped up fine, mostly to add some color. I peppered the top but didn't salt it, but definitely add salt. It's too bland otherwise.
