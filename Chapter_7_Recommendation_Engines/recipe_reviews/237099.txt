These black bottom cupcakes were pretty good and we will make them again with a few changes. The bake time was WAY too long for us, we will keep testing in that time range. We used 1/3 cup cocoa powder and added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the water for richer flavor. We are a huge cheese cake family, so next time we will use 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of the full amount. Although the recipe is good, we would have preferred to taste more cheese cake.  As written, this is a 4 star recipe (if you adjust the bake time). The changes make it 5 star for our family's taste preferences. The bottom line: these mini cupcakes will not disappoint.
