As written this recipe doesn't work, the ratio of wet to dry is off. I started with the two eggs and two egg yolks and the dough had the consistency of a crumble. I proceeded to add another egg and it was still off so I added the two egg whites and still had to add a little water to make it come together. I make fresh pasta often and this took far longer than stated. As well,  I believe that it would serve closer to 10. The finished product is silky and delicious hence the three stars.
