Really good! After assembling, I put them in my crock pot dish and refrigerated overnight. I reheated in the crock pot for several hours with a few pats of butter on top. Would never have had time to make mashed potatoes on Christmas day otherwise.

I use a recipe very similar to this one but with a few changes.  I don't use any milk but use two sticks of margarine instead.  After boiling peeled potatos, I place all ingredients in a large bowl and use an electric mixer to combine ingredients and make them very fluffy.  I don't use any onion salt either, just lots of pepper and salt.  I don't ever bake mine either.  If making ahead, I put them in a microwave safe caserole bowl and microwave them for about 10-15 minutes prior to serving.  Hope this helps!

Make these every Thanksgiving now.  So good and helps doing them ahead.  I usually put a couple of cloves of garlic in the pot when I boil the potoes and then just mash them right in too.

DELICIOUS!!! I made this recipe a couple of days before Thanksgiving & kept the potatoes in the refrigerator til the morning of - then  reheated them in my crock pot until ready to serve.  Received rave reviews -even from my son-in-law who considers himself a mashed potato connoisseur.

The name of this recipe caught my attention first, because I needed something convenient for Thanksgiving. But the taste is what kept my attention! This went right into my recipe box. These are the creamiest, most wonderful mashed potatoes! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, followed it exactly and it is wonderful! Thank you for this keeper recipe.

The last minute hassle of mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving has come to an end. I have made this recipe two years in a row and my guests have asked me to promise it will stay on the menu. I used onion salt the first time and found the taste a bit processed. This year I replaced with a few cloves of roasted garlic and some butter sauteed rosemary. Yum.

I also have made a similar recipe for years, but my recipe calls for 1 TBSP of minced onion rather than the onion salt and 1/2 tsp seasoned salt. And only as much milk as you want for the right consistency. I like to drizzle the butter over the top, but being weight conscious I only use a tablespoon instead of what the recipe calls for. Add a sprinkling of paprika on top before you bake and it gives a pretty looking finished product.

I made these Christmas Eve, with a few minor changes.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth, I was also GOING to add some garlic cloves, but forgot.  When I was mashing them I added about 5 ozs cream cheese, 8 oz sour cream, 1/2 cup heavy cream (b/c I wanted to use it up), and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Put them in the crock pot w/ a few pats of butter, and popped in the fridge overnight.  Christmas morning I took them out and let them thaw a bit on the counter, then cooked on the low setting of the crock pot for about 4 hrs.  They were perfect!  Nobody could believe they were made the day before, and everyone absolutely loved them!  Will make many more times!!

I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  They tasted good, alothough they were a little "soupy".  I think I would check the consistency before adding all of the milk.

Rich, creamy and oh so delicious! This is certainly comfort food at it's best! But, the very best part about this recipe is the fact that you can "Make it Ahead" of time which is a real life-saver around the holidays!  I didn't bother baking this in a casserole because my oven was doing all the work with the rest of the meal. I simply put this in my crock pot on low in order to reheat and serve.  Definitely not for those counting calories and something you want to save for special occasions - great recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2009.  No one liked them. I followed the recipe, made no changes.  While they were cooking and after we mashed them and added everything the recipe called for, and taste tested them they were wonderful. We couldn't wait to try them at dinner time. .  But after putting them in the casserole and baking them they tasted totally different.  Won't waste my time make these again ..........ever.  Very costly recipe to make and not have it be good !!!!!

I usually make my mashed potatoes this way.  The only difference is that I heat up the cream cheese, sour cream and milk before I add them in.  A trick my Grandmother taught me is to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder to the mashed potatoes and they puff up and become light and fluffy.

To conserve on oven space I prepared these a few hours in advance and kept them on hold in my slow cooker, separating the cover from the pot with a terry towel to absorb any moisture and stirring  them periodically.  I used a few good-sized cloves of garlic in the boiling water instead of the onion powder, a full eight ounce package of cream cheese, and found I didn't need the milk at all.  I thought I'd miss any addition of butter, but was surprised I didn't. Good, basic mashed potatoes.

I made these for Thanksgiving diner (Canada) on Monday and they were a big hit. What a great time saver. I will substitute fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream the next time I make them and see how they turn out. I think keeping a container of them in the freezer would be a great idea. These tasted great without gravy.

I had these SUPER mashed potatoes for the first time several years ago at my friend Eileen's house. Her mom, Marie was famous for this recipe. It's obviously very rich, so save it for special occasions, but please try it because it's absolutely delicious!

I rate this one a five star because you can freeze them up to a month before you use them. Just take them out of the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you want them. I always use red potatoes. Most potatoes go watery when frozen but not these.

I love to find new recipes that I can make ahead for large family gatherings and holidays, and this was a Thanksgiving favorite! I made these the day before, boiling my potatoes in vegetable stock, for added flavor. I only had 1 package of cream cheese, but I used heavy cream instead of milk, so they were still creamy. I also substitued plain yogurt for the sour cream, and white pepper for black pepper (white pepper makes a huge difference--try it!). My family LOVED these and I loved having one less thing to make on Thanksgiving. I actually had time to sit and watch a little football this year! Thank you, Carol!

I make these every year for Thanksgiving. I make the potatoes on Wednesday, and instead of baking them on Thanksgiving, I put them in the crockpot about 2 hours before dinner time. They are hot and taste delicious!

Made this for the holiday a day before and it turned out great.  I like my mashed potatoes creamy so I used all the ingredients as listed and added four tablespoons unsalted butter.  After spreading in a greased baking dish, I then drizzled two tablespoons of melted butter on top and sprinkled with paprika.  Refrigerated 24 hours then brought to room temperature (about an hour)and baked 30 minutes at 350 degrees with aluminum foil on top then took foil off and baked an additional 20 minutes.  Came out delicious and shows nice too.  Perfect for making ahead of time.

What a great alternative to frenzied potato mashing as your trying to get the rest of the food on for Thanksgiving. I followed another reviewers advice and  reheated in my crock pot to save on oven space. I ended up putting them in too early, woops, next time I think they will only need about 2 1/2 hours on low...don't forget to stir. I omitted the onion salt and sauted a minced shallot and clove of garlic in a couple Tbsp. butter and added that and 1 tsp. salt to the potatoes instead. YUM! Thanks for making Thanksgiving dinner a little easier!

As is, I thought these just weren't very good. They were too dry and bland. I wound up adding about 1/2 cup butter, a little extra milk and some salt. (The onion salt was completely unnoticed) After these changes, they tasted like ordinary mashed potates with milk and butter. I think maybe if you add butter to this recipe you might want to increase the amount of sour cream for extra flavor.

Absolutely the best mashed potatoes I've ever made or eaten.  Made them a day ahead for a big dinner and it was great not to have the mess that day.  I put them in a crock pot and heated on low all day.  Very easy and simple.

Delicious!  I made these the night before and I re-heated using the crock pot method as I had very little stove top space.  Perfect mashed potatoes for our Thanksgiving dinner!

Delicious!!!  I followed the tip of adding in garlic cloves while boiling the potatoes.  I made these for my daughters wedding reception and everyone raved about them.  Will definately make these again!

This is my holiday dinner staple. I prepare the day before and heat by keeping on "warm" in the crock pot for several hours.

Made these for Christmas Eve, it's a keeper! Only difference is that I used Russets as we don't care for yellow potatoes. Using again for Easter--went mad looking for the recipe as I didn't keep a copy of it -- learned the hard way

I followed this exactly except used russet since store was out of yukons. While I love cream cheese, I found the tang a bit too overwhelming in the mashed potatoes.

I have made these for years; it what everyone always asks me to bring to family dinners.  I use equal parts of sour cream and cream cheese though, and add shredded cheddar cheese as well.  I then top with some shredded cheddar and bake until they are golded brown.

I am so glad I found this recipe! It was a snap to prepare and absolutely delicious! I used petite Yukon gold potatoes, fat-free sour cream, and I omitted the milk.... I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

I made this for Thanksgiving because I liked the idea of making this ahead for my Crockpot.  It was easy to make and the consistency was great.  However the taste was way too rich for my liking.  Next time I will only add 1 package of cream cheese.

I add 1 stick of butter, very little salt instead of the onion salt, use 8 oz of cream cheese, and whip the potatoes to get them fluffy.  These will keep for 2 weeks, the older the better.  We tailgate with a large crowd of RVers and they all love these mashed potatoes.

I used regular potatoes that I had on hand, one pack of fat-free cream cheese, one pack of low-fat cream cheese, and low-fat sour cream.  I reduced the onion powder and added garlic powder as others have recommended.  I cooked this dish  to take to my sister's for Christmas Eve dinner.  So, after combining, I placed potato mixture in a crockpot rather than baking in the oven. Plugged in the crock pot at my sister's house, added a dab of butter, and gave a quick stir to fluff potatoes. Everyone complimented me on these potatoes; they were delicious.

Very tasty.  If you are going to heat them for next day's use in a crock pot.  Take the potatotes out of the frig and let them warm up a bit.  You can also start the warming process by heating them in the microwave and then move them to the crockpot and top with butter.

I made this for Thanksgiving exactly as the recipe states because I had never made potatoes ahead before and was skeptical. I put it in a crockpot liner in the frig overnight and as it warmed it was still way too thick. I pulled out a handheld mixer and whipped in some milk until it had a nice consistancy. They were a hit!! I will make them again to save time and space in the oven. Thanks!

I make this recipe all the time and get rave reviews. The kids can't get enough of them! I have found the original recipe to be a bit dry, so I usually use half the potatoes (2.5-3 lbs.). I have also been known to add some cheddar cheese to the mix. YUM!

I made a double batch of these one day ahead for Thanksgiving supper.  I used regular white potatoes.  These turned out great, and reheated nicely the next day.  There was none leftover! This is the recipe  will use from now on for large gatherings.

I had friends in town from the Midwest, who are true "meat and potatoes" kind of people.  I don't make mashed potatoes often, but these were a hit.  I never knew you could reheat mashed potatoes and they would come out fluffy and light.  I impressed even myself.  This is a great make-ahead recipe.  A true time safer and a great dish!

This recipe made Christmas dinner a breeze for me! I was worried that everyone would taste the "off" flavor of the soured products, but you can't tell there's any cream cheese or sour cream in there at all! I would recommend adding a little extra milk for moisture and dotting the mashed potatoes with butter before baking.

I only make this recipe for Holidays and love it. Make it the day before eliminates one more thing you have to do the day of the Holiday.  I do not bake it in the oven at all.  If you have a large crowd you need to make 10 lbs.  I put it in the fridge over night and then put in my slow cooker add a little butter on top and warm it up the next day.  Taste just like freshly made mashed potatoes.  Delicious big hit not bland at all.

I've been making this dish for almost 30 years! Instead of onion salt, I use celery salt to taste and a tablespoon or so of dried onion flakes, You can make these and freeze them for Thanksgiving or for any day for that matter. I melt a stick of butter and pour over the top before freezing and pop them in the oven for about 1 hour at 350*. My favorite potato recipe.

Such a time saver, and the potatoes were the hit of the meal!  I made them a few days ahead, stored them in a large zip lock bag in the fridge and then warmed them up in the Crockpot on Thanksgiving Day.  If I do it again, I may reduce the amount of milk only because the crockpot caused them to get a little runny.  Still, it's a great recipe.

Made these potatoes for Thanksgiving. Instead of baking, followed others' suggestion and put them in the slow cooker. Put a few pats of butter on top, but it wasn't necessary to keep the potatoes from being too stiff. Rave reviews from guests! Thanks for the post

I made a LOT of ingredient substitutions on this one (last minute decision, had to go with what we had), so this review is mostly for the method used here, and not the flavors.  I was really pleased with how these came out!  I didn't add as much milk as recommended and was worried that they'd dry out in the oven, but they didn't; they were a little more solid than my regular mashed potatoes, but far from dry.  So I'd advise making them to your desired consistency and flavor before baking, or just a tiny bit wetter.  (FWIW, I used goat cheese instead of cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper instead of onion salt, and a big spoonful of whatever psuedo-butter-in-a-tub is currently in our fridge.  I'd totally recommend any of those changes, but I'd also like to try the recipe as written.)

The kids in my extended family adore this recipe and beg me to bring to family get-to-togethers. I use "light" and "no-fat" versions of all products and find that these potatoes aren't as rich. I also add a bit more milk and add less cream cheese to the original recipe.

This is a keeper!

The kids in my extended family adore this recipe and beg me to bring to family get-to-togethers. I use "light" and "no-fat" versions of all products and find that these potatoes aren't as rich. I also add a bit more milk and add less cream cheese to the original recipe.

This is a keeper!

I've made these for Thanksgiving the last three years. When you're cooking for 15 people, the last thing you want to be doing is mashing potatoes at the last minute. They've gotten rave reviews from the family, and we never have any leftovers. My only change would be to go with no fat cream cheese and sour cream.

Just made these, and used lite sour cream, lite cream cheese, and skim milk to bring down the fat level, but they still tasted awesome.  Easy to prepare and I only made 1/2 the recipe, as it was only for 2 of us.  Will make again, specially for a party, as you can make ahead of time and pop in oven when you're ready.

Yummy! I used Russet potatoes and split it into two dishes since it made such a huge amount. I "baked" them in the microwave for 25 minutes at 50% power. Fabulous!

Excellent!  Very worth while not having to peel and mash the potatoes the day of the big dinner.  I used garlic poweder and next time, I would definitely try sour cream with chives or a flavored cream cheese.

Super Yummy!  I was fretting about making mash potatoes for Thanksgiving and these were delish.  I make them all the time now. So easy.  I used regular russet potatoes because they were on sale- so good!  The onion salt really set them over the top! Thanks Carol!

These are a LIFESAVER! Even the mashed potato challenged can make these. I have NEVER had a problem with them being glue-y or starchy. Delicious flavor. This is my third Thanksgiving that I will use this recipe. People always ask for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and although it was nice to have them done ahead of time, the last thing I needed was to have
another thing to put in my oven while making
a turkey, other casseroles, and baking rolls.
Nobody commented specifically about the potatoes being different...once gravy was used
I don't think anyone even noticed.

We cut this in half for our family of 5 and it was very good. I like the convenience, make ahead, ready to pop in oven when you are busy. Flavor can be varied by adding garlic or flavored cream cheese (garden vegetable). We use low fat sour cream & still good.

This was a huge disappointment. Made it the day before. Followed the recipe and it came out dry. We originally gave it three stars then we reheated it last night and we had to add about a cup of milk unless we wanted to be eating dry potatoes. I'll keep looking for a better mashed potatoe recipe than this one.

Best tasting potatoes yet! Even as left overs. I did these for Thanksgiving.  When reheating allow plenty of time if you put them thick in a pan. Next year I would put them in 2 sallow pans for reheating.

I use my kitchen aid mixer for this recipe. Add 1/4 stick butter, substitute milk with buttermilk and or whipping cream. 4 cloves garlic minced and sautéed in 2 tbs oil oil until golden brown. Add garlic to bottom of kitchen aid mixing bowl then cream cheese/ sour cream, butter, salt and pepper. Use the mix paddle to incorporate ingredients then whisk for additional 3 minutes adding your liquid to desired consistency. So good.

I made these for Thanksgiving 2016 and plan to make them for Christmas and every family meal forever. I used heavy cream instead of milk just because I can splurge for the holidays. My guests raved about this rich creamy potato dish. I highly recommend this make ahead recipe!

My family only wants these potatoes for holidays.  I tried this recipe because you can do it ahead and that way you can concentrate on other things the day of.
I am handicapped and it has been awesome not to overdue it during dinners.  THey love the taste and we had different cheeses to change it up depending on the occasion. 
I have double and tripled this recipe and put it in zip lock bags to freeze.  Freeze in different size bags depending on how many you will be serving.  For one days work you can have alot of sides for meals.

I made these for my daughter's birthday dinner. Followed the recipe except used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in the water while boiling the potatoes.  Also used half and half for the milk. My family raved after them. This will definitely be a holiday keeper! Thank you so much for this  recipe.

Made this recipe this morning for Thanksgiving and after mixing potatos,cream cheese and butter I found that I didn't need any milk, they seemed a little running. Also didn't add the sour cream. Have them in the crockpot to keep warm till dinner and hoping they will stiffen up some while waiting.

When I added this recipe to my recipe box and discovered I had used it last year, I decided it was time to categorize my recipes to prevent duplication. Obviously, we enjoy these potatoes. This is a simple and good recipe that eliminates last minute hustle; true comfort food.

I made this for a Sunday supper, and wanted to get the potatoes out of the way so I could relax before the pot roast was done. This was the answer to not having to time the potatoes to be done right with dinner! These are great even if you don't bake them a second time - I keep stealing bites after they were done.

Delicious! My guests raved about them! Didn't have onion salt, so I used regular salt.  The potatoes I used seemed dry, so I added a little more milk to get the right consistency.  I prefer my potatoes light and fluffy. I made my casserole earlier in the day. What a time saver it was.   This will be my regular recipe for mashed potatoes.

I made these potatoes for Easter Dinner and we really enjoyed them.  I did cut the recipe in half because there were only four of us, and had plenty for leftovers.  This will be my new go-to mashed potato recipe for big holiday dinners.  Definitely cuts my time in the kitchen on the day of the big meal.

Absolutely Fantastic. I didn't have onion salt, so I used 2 tsp of onion powder and 1 tsp of salt. I miss them when they're gone.

This was great!  I didn't have any onion or garlic salt so I used tastefully simple's onion, onion seasoning.  It turned out good. We didn't really taste the cream cheese, not sure what it added??  I put it in the crock pot to heat and it turned out great!

I made these last year for Thanksgiving, and they were a huge hit! They are now my new way for making mashed potatoes. My family is disappointed when I use my "old" recipe!
Thanks for sharing!!

I thought these were very tasty!  I used fat-free sour cream, and reduced-fat cream cheese, and then baked them (covered) the next day.  They were fluffy and not dry at all.  My 10 month old and three year old ate them up, and normally mashed potatoes are very unappealing to them.  I will definately make these again!

Absolutely Great - especially with the make ahead feature.  Will be using this routinely at the holidays.  Many thanks.

These mashed potatoes are delicious! I used garlic salt instead of onion salt. I made them for my family's Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!

Delicious mashed potatoes.  What a plus to be able to do them ahead of time.  I served them last Thanksgiving and my family loved them. Thanks for a great recipe.

I served this recipe (12 servings)as a Thanksgiving "trial" to a dinner group of 6 adults and it was almost ALL gone, mostly because the men in the group ate 2 huge servings each. It will be a big help this Thanksgiving not to have to be peeling potatoes the "day of". It tastes a lot like twice-baked potatoes; you have to like sour cream and cream cheese. I didn't have any onion salt so used onion powder and salt. I whipped the potatoes with an electric mixer. Texture was perfect.
