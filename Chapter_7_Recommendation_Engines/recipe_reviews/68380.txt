Made this for dinner last night, what can I say . . .EXCELLENT!  

The only changes I made were I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of just 1 tablespoon (this was a recipe for 4) and to be honest, I think next time I will add even more lemon.  We like that lemon flavor!! Also, I used cheddar (hard) slices and I think I will do the shredded cheddar and I will try and spread the cream cheese on (instead of chunky).  Maybe that will prevent it from oozing out!! :) 

Overall, this is an excellent recipe and VERY flavorful and to be honest, VERY easy to make. . .a must try for any household!

Good, but as others suggested and I wished I would have listened, is cut the cream cheese in half because it was a little overwhelming.  Other than that, we enjoyed.  Thanks

Wow - this is fabubous and I swear you could put just about anything rolled up inside a chicken breast and it's bound to be good. Plus the combination of three different cheese was an indication to me that this was going to be tasty. I did make a couple of changes... First I pounded my chicken breasts down thin. Second I used light shredded cheddar cheese that I combined with softened light cream cheese until it was blended. to stuff the chicken and rolled the chicken securing  with toothpicks. I dipped the chicken in egg and milk then the bread crumb mixture to form a light coating. I then drizzled it with the melted butter mixture and baked it according to the directions. The result was a very moist and flavorful chicken bursting with a delicious cheese filled center!

Really good, thanks for sharing.  I actually chose to flatten the chicken, add the cheese and then roll them up.  I used far less cream cheese and threw in some bacon along with the cheese mixture.  Also used Panko crumbs as opposed to breadcrumbs.  I thought the lemon garlic butter was the best thing about this dish, and, if making again, I would ditch dunking them in milk before breading and just use the lemon garlic butter (pouring any remaining over the chicken).  I think that would add tremendous flavor.  Again, thanks for the recipe....it was nice and different!

Made this last week - what a great recipe!  I didn't have any cream cheese on hand, so I mixed cheddar, mozzarella, and sour cream for the filling.  Turned out awesome.  Husband was impressed, and we're having it again tonight!

Yum yum yummy!!! This recipe was so easy - and tastes HEAVENLY! My husband issued appreciative groans (mouth full of warm melted stuffing...) from his side of the plate when this was served! I low-carbed it to my liking - replacing the Italian bread crumbs with almond flour, Italian seasoning, and kosher salt. Also, since I didn't have Romano, I just used more shredded cheddar. This was a heavenly savory recipe  - and great for company! Best of all, I made the full recipe and froze 6 of the chicken breasts. They reheated beautifully as an at-work lunch. What a treat! Thanks for posting this one!

This recipe was excellent!  My husband doesn't care for chicken, so I'm always trying new ways of fixing it.  Well, you know what they say, cheese makes everything taste better!  I butterflied the chicken breasts as directed in the recipe (rather than rolling as suggested by other reviewers) and it worked fine.  Some cheese melted out, but not that much.  I did take the suggestion of reducing the amount of cream cheese.  I reduced it by about a quarter, but I think half would be better next time.  I served this with pasta and we ended up cutting up our chicken breasts into bite size pieces and mixing it with the pasta.  On top of the pasta, I just had a mixture of melted butter, lemon juice, minced garlic and dried basil.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  It takes a little prepping, but it's worth it.

Soooooo delicious! It's a special occasion dinner. Full of flavor and great texture and easy. I didn't change a thing.
p.s.- I hate people who review based on calories and fat. (when they haven't even made the recipe) Everyone doesn't have to lose weight!!! Keep those comments to yourself and don't hurt the recipes star rating.

This was very nice. I followed reviewers advice and used less cream cheese and toothpicks. I also had some sliced ham in the fridge which I needed to use and this seemed the perfect recipe. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I felt it was a bit too rich for my tastes and hubby's. I recommend that you don't drizzle the extra butter over the top as it is too much with the cream cheese, tasty cheese, cheese in the crumbs. Just a squirt of lemon and sprinkle of garlic salt should be fine. I did add paprika on top and these cooked fine. I served with bread machine rolls from this site. (see photo)

Absolutely wonderful!  I made this last week and my husband requested it again yesterday.  Very easy to make and ingredients always on hand.  Serve over rice and double the butter/garlic sauce so there is enough to spoon on top of rice.

Delicious and easy! I was looking for a new recipe for chicken, my husband is less than thrilled when I thaw chicken for dinner. Found this one, had everything on hand so I decided to try it. I made just a few changes: I seasoned the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning, then used soft cream cheese instead of sliced. I put a dollop inside each breast, and I used shredded cheddar as was suggested by another cook. And it was also suggested to skip the milk, so I did and instead coated the stuffed breasts in the butter/lemon/garlic and then breaded with panko breadcrumbs and parmesan. Drizzled the rest of the butter/lemon sauce over the chicken and baked. So easy, and so tasty! I put this in my recipe box and will definitely be making this one again.

LOVED THIS! Tasted light and the breast did not dry out- my hubby hates chicken breast usually due to the dryness. I was at a loss as to what to accompany it with- until I found the "Lemon Pasta sauce" by Holly. Topped linguine with sauce and chicken, asparagus on the side- YUMMY!

My only thought was that the chicken was somewhat hard to roll around the cheese- so I will get the breasts tenderized by my hubby the butcher next time- will make the breast flatter and easier to roll. I also see this as pretty failproof in that I did not have any cheddar on had so I used cream cheese and sliced muenster ( hubbies fav) and it came out great!

Something very similar but simpler.I started out with the idea of making this according to recipe. I switched it up a bit. I bought two chicken breasts from the meat counter and asked them to butterfly it and tenderize it for me (cut down on the prep time for me). I used presliced mild cheddar and mozzerella cheeses for the filling. This way it would melt more evenly. I also bought a bag of pre shredded Kraft "Italian - Five cheese" cheese for the top. I simply coated the bottom of a cassarole dish with olive oil. Breaded the chicken breasts. Layed one on the bottom (since it was butterflied it was thin and covered the bottom of the whole pan) then ilayered cheeses. Topped that layer with the other breaded chicken breast. Added a little extra bread crumbs on top. Baked at 300 for 20min. Added lemon butter "sauce" and baked another 10 min. Added the Italian -Five cheese mixture to top and baked another 10 min. Chicken was cooked perfect and was absolutely delicious and alot easier than messing around with toothpicking or rolling the chicken. I made twice as much of the lemon butter suace and mixed it in with bowtie pasta. Worked perfect and tied everything together. I will be making it over and over again. The boyfriend already wants it again next week. Absolutely amazing!

Great recipe!!! I too added more lemon than it called for. To make it a bit lighter I used laughing cow wedges (used garlic flavored) instead of cream cheese - turned out spectacular.

Amazing. My absolute favorite chicken meal! Have had many people ask me for the recipe. Love it!
Others have asked me what it means to "seal" the edges. Just close the chicken breast like you would a book and make sure the edges are closed tight so they are touching. They will "seal" themselves while cooking :)

Very good chicken recipe!!  I halved the recipe using 3 large chicken breasts and butterflied as the recipe directed (rather than pounding as others suggested) and it worked fine.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and just spread a thin layer across the entire piece of chicken then topped with shredded Colby jack cheese and crumbled bacon.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BACON, it added a lot of flavor and took away from the richness of all the cheese (also great for low carb diet)!  Cooked about 40 minutes and served with rice and salad.

Although this recipe was good, it was very heavy. i could only eat 1/2 of the smallest breast of chicken before i had to clear it away. My boyfriend liked it, but thought it was too rich as well and could only be made once in a great while. If i make it again, i will not give it the breaded topping, use a white cheese, and serve it with a tomato sauce.

Unbelievably good!  However, I did make a few changes.  Instead of sliced cheeses, I mixed shredded cheddar cheese with a block of cream cheese then divided it evenly between the breasts (much easier to handle this way!).  In addition, I added a couple stalks of asparagus to each chicken roll.  The contrast between the crunch of the asparagus and the creaminess of the cheese was to die for!  Then instead of dipping my chicken roll into milk, I dipped each roll into melted butter instead (1/2 cup...it's not like this recipe is low fat).  I skipped the lemon/butter sauce and baked it as is.  Then I topped with Blender Hollandaise Sauce from this site.  My husband wants to to make this for our next dinner party, it is THAT good!

This was delicious!  I didn't have lemon on hand, so I substituted a very tart orange from our tree for the sauce, omitted the garlic from the sauce, and added extra garlic powder to the coating mixture.  Also added some fresh spinach leaves in with the cream cheese and cheddar.  Came out really really yummy!  Will definitely be making this again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I did decrease the amount of cream cheese, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Very nice dish.  Would be great with other cheeses as well as more lemon in the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a really easy recipe that tastes like you slaved away all day. I used 6 breasts cause that's all I had. I also had half of a pack (4oz) of fat-free cream cheese and some shredded cheddar cheese left over from another recipe so I just divided the cream cheese in 6 equal slices and placed inside the sliced breast as the recipe describes.I then eye balled the cheddar and used it up equally. I used a prepackaged breading mix so I dipped the breasts in melted butter then into the breading. Using the same butter, I then added the garlic and lemon juice and let the garlic cook a little bit then drizzled it over the chicken. Mine took about 50 mintues to bake in the 350 degree oven. I got no oozing of the cheese and the breasts were tender and juicy and delicious.

This is the first recipe I ever tried from this website and I have always loved it. I do enjoy Panko Italian bread crumbs over the regular. Also after I butterfly the breasts I flatten them a bit more so the cheese has more room to spread and less leaking out.

Husband loved this.  I've never loved lemon chicken of any kind, but this was the best I've had.  I left out the cheddar and whipped roasted garlic and lemon zest into the cream cheese.  Instead of cheese in the crust, I added lemon zest and garlic salt. Drizzled with plain butter.  It's a great recipe and I'm sure it will be requested again.

I made this recipe using fresh grated romano cheese and fresh lemon juice and rolling them up instead of slicing the chicken in half.  I love paprika and so sprinkled a little more of that on the top also.  The cream cheese was the reduced fat kind and we could not tell at all.  My husband said many times how much he liked this, so that is the only reason I need to give this 5 stars!

Excellent.  I browned my chicken breasts in a small amount of olive oil before placing in baking dish.  To eliminate the cheese from oozing out, I cut up my cheese a few hours before using, and put the cheese in the freezer before stuffing my chicken.   I also used toothpicks to seal my chicken.  The sauce was excellent.

This is the best recipe ever!  And, it is pretty simple, just sounds complicated.  I made this for my boyfriend (didn't expect it to work but it did) and he loved it.  I cut my cheese slices a little thinner so they would fit flatter, and I pinned the chicken shut with toothpicks.  It also helps if you make the butter sauce ahead of time.  If you make too much, the butter garlic is good to brush on rolls to go with the chicken or save for something else.  Happy cooking!

Very nice and rich! Everyone liked this, even my picky eater. We halved the recipe and had to make our own seasoned bread crumbs with Panko crumbs and Italian herb seasoning blend (what was in the house) and I think the Panko crumbs give an excellent crunch. The store was out of Romano cheese so I subbed Parmesan. I think the Romano would have been better though. Used just under half the melted butter with 1 TBSP lemon juice, but next time I would used the 2 TBSP even for half the recipe. I like it a tad more lemony because the chicken is so rich. Definitely season the chicken with the garlic salt and paprika. Next time I would add some pepper too. We cooked it a little more than the time said because the chicken was still pink. Served with bow-tie pasta and pesto, and salad.

So easy and quick to throw together after work! I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of cutting it into strips. That's all I had on hand, so it worked! This is so good and creamy. My hubby loved it, this recipe is a keeper for sure.

This recipe is really great. So much flavor! I used the same amoutn of ingredients for only 3 chicken breasts as I love the sauce it creates. I dribble the extra sauce out of the pan onto the chicken breasts once on the plate.

Very yummy. Thanks so much for a keeper!

This dish was awesome.  Since I am gluten free I used crushed rice crackers and crushed potato chips as the breading.

This was seriously delicious. Everyone in the family loved it and it's very pretty to serve. I flattened the chicken breasts and rolled. I also doubled the sauce (which was amazing!!). Great recipe, will make again and again.

It was a HUGE hit at the christmas eve party at our place. Everyone was impressed and it tasted delicious. I mixed the cream cheese with the garlic in a bowl and added some chopped jalapenos to it before scooping it into the chicken breasts. Also, I used pre-thinly-sliced chicken from Giant and that made this recipe a lot easier! Thanks for an extremely delicious recipe!

I think this is a really good recipe, but I did make a couple of changes.  I used shredded cheddar ('cause I had it), parmesan instead of romano ('cause I had it).  I also put the paprika in with the breadcrumbs and then I sauteed the breasts in olive oil and garlic before I put it in the oven and left out the garlic salt.  I think browning them before baking added a lot of flavor.  I made a lemon sauce with flour, pepper, chicken broth, apple and lemon juice in the skillet that I browned the breasts in and mixed the sauce with pasta.  Delish!

I made this tonight for dinner, and my family loved it. I halved the recipe using 4 chicken breasts. The only changes were to accommodate personal tastes and ingredients I had on-hand. The breasts were very large. So I increased the bread crumbs and added Kraft Oven Fry for more crunch. I used fresh shredded parmigiano reggiano instead of Romano cheese because that's what I had on hand, and increased the garlic and lemon juice a little for the butter sauce. I pounded the breasts before cutting the pockets, and baked them for 40 minutes because they were so large. 3 of us ate only two of the breasts with mixed rice and Normandy veggies, and we were all stuffed. Prep took me about 30 minutes and cook time 40 minutes. The finished dish looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful. It was very rich will all of the cheese, and not something you would want to eat too often. As a special treat or an elegant looking meal to serve guests, this would be perfect. When making it, choose small breast for each person to have a whole one, or plan on 1/2 breast for each person. This recipe also opens a whole realm of ideas for different stuffings.

Excellent! I'm doing low-carb, so I omitted the crumb coating, sprinkled with paprika for visual appeal. For the stuffing I mixed together cream cheese, shredded sharp cheddar, garlic, coarse grind black pepper, and bacon bits. Cooked in crock pot on High for 3 hrs. This wil be my next "company" meal. Superior!

I LOVED this recipe. This is now my favorite CKN recipe. My 3 year old ate it up as well. I thought the lemon taste would be a tad to tart but she and I both ate it up. Next time I will make sure I make more then the 3 breasts I used when trying this recipe out. YUMMY!!! Thanks for sharing.

I personally did not enjoy this recipe. I followed everything I was supposed to do and when it came out of the oven it looked nice but when i tasted it I had a horrible surprise. The cream cheese/cheese mixture with the chicken was just plain nasty. I will not be making this again.

Made this last night, was a big hit. I followed other reviewers suggestion and cut back on the cream cheese and I had to leave off the lemon since we had none in the house. But it was really good. Baking time took about 40 minutes since I never pounded out the chicken ( I had a 1 year old pulling on my leg) , but meat was tender. Delicious!

Ooo my. I used minced jarred garlic. Used bottled lemon juice. Cooked exactly as suggested. Sauce was perfect, a little lemony, but not too much. Nice crunchy coating. Made with garlic butter rice and broccoli with garlic and toasted pine nuts. The perfect meal. Used the spreadable cream cheese *might be worth a try to use the herbed cream cheeses!* and shredded medium cheddar cheese. YUM!

I Love this recipe, my boyfriend asks for it at least every other week.  I did change a few things, instead of the butter I use canned chicken broth.  I don't always have romono cheese on hand so i'll subsitute parmesan.  I always add a few extra spices into the bread crumbs (what ever I have around and looks good).  I also add an egg to the milk, it just makes the bread crumbs stick to the chicken a little better.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is the second time making it. I halved the cream cheese and doubled the lemon juice. I used the lemon/garlic butter to dunk chicken in for breaking instead of milk. Flattened the chicken prior to baking for 34 minutes then on broil for one minute! The chicken was spectacular! Very rich but oh so delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

It was just "meh". Nothing fabulous. Maybe I had higher expectations from all the wonderful reviews that I had read. It was a little on the bland side, I had even added salt and pepper to the breast and breadcrumbs and used the paprika and garlic powder as well. As for the lemon drizzle, although it tasted good I found that it made the crust a little soggier than I liked. I prefer a crispy crust and turned on the broiler to fix it, but it still wasn't to my liking.
I will definitely not be making this again.

I tried this recipe thinking it would be a little difficult. No way, it was very easy to make; and so delicious that I have become addicted to it and have made it once a week for the past month! I am so happy to have this elegant yet semi-simple recipe to show off my kitchen skills=)
One change is that I broil it a few minutes at the end to give it a more decadent look and texture. Amazing recipe!!! Thank you forever for it!!!

This was really good! Instead of milk dip the chicken in the lime/butter sauce before breading, then drizzle left over sauce on top of breast. Topped with shredded parmesan. Squeezed lemon on top just before serving

We made this with cream cheese and shredded mexican cheese which is what we had on hand.  Did not use nearly as much cheese as called for.  Used tangerine instead of lemon again because of what was in frig. This is a great recipe and very flexible...obviously.  Thanks!!

Just made this last night. Cheers all around.  I prefer pounding the chicken down, as opposed to butterflying the chicken.  We ended up using about 1/2 the cream cheese, and will use 1/2 cup melted butter in the future.  Really good flavor here!  A definite winner!

I let the cream cheese soften then spread it in a pocket cut into the chicken and sprinkled with shredded cheddar.  I also had some cooked bacon bits I stuffed in there as well.  I sprinkled the garlic salt on the chicken before coating with an egg/milk mix then the crumbs/cheese.  For the melted butter, I didn't have a lemon so I used lemon pepper and herb seasoning.  I did use the paprika too.  This came out great!

This is an easy recipe but I wasn't too impressed with the results.  Based on other reviews, I used less cream cheese and less butter and placed toothpicks in the chicken to prevent oozing.  The result was dry and bland chicken breasts despite adding basil and salt/pepper to the recipe.

The flavors are amazing.  The cheese has a tendency to leak out, so make sure it is wrapped and secured well.  I serve this at dinner parties with lightly buttered steamed broccoli and a salad - it has a lot of flavor, so I wouldn't add too much flavor on the veggie side dish.

I thought this was a great dish with minimal prep time.  I made extra, froze the chicken breasts so I can thaw them in the fridge the night before I want them and presto. . .dinner in a flash!  5 stars.

Yummy recipe.  I didn´t have cream cheese so I used laughing cow soft cheese.  What a great flavour.  Also, I tried stuffing the breasts, and making rolls, and the rolls with thin slices of chicken.  The rolls had more flavour.

This is one of my favorite recipes I have borrowed from this site.  My mouth just waters thinking about how delicious and juicy the chicken is.  Wow, I've already made it a couple of times and there isn't a thing I would change with the recipe.  YUM!

WOW!!!!! I have made lots of stuffed chicken breasts and this one really really is good!!  I pounded out my chicken and spread cream cheese and put shredded cheddar and rolled.  I put a meat therm. on the meat to make sure it did not get dry (165f) and came out PERFECT.  If your wondering weather or not to me make this...MAKE IT as you won't be disappointed I promise!!!  The flavors all melted very nice!  I used more lemon and glad I did as it could get lost in all the flavors. This for sure will be a keeper!!

Very tasty recipe! I used "I can't believe it butter" instead of real butter and it came out great. I also did not add the 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt.I cooked mine for 60 minutes, I think the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breast you are using.

I only made one change to this recipe - I used shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese, and it worked great.  My husband was very impressed with me for cooking this chicken.  He raved about it so much at work that one of his co-workers asked me for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!

Just tried this recipe for the first time and made some modification based on everyone's input and I made it for 6 servings. It turned out fantastic! I cut the lemon garlic butter sauce with olive oil and used the "smart balance" 50/50 buttery spread to cut the fat content a bit. I also added fresh ground 3 pepper blend and a bit of cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp)for the sauce; extra lemon juice (about 3 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice). 

For the stuffing I used 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of shredded colby jack cheese. I also took another reviewers advice and used sour cream (light sour cream) instead of the cream cheese. About 3/4 cup of light sour cream. I mixed the cheeses and sour cream together in a big bowl and added 1/2 of a diced red onion and 1/2 of each of red, yellow and orange bell peppers chopped as well. (fresh and ground salt pepper to taste!)

I butterflied the breasts and used toothpicks to secure it (didn't pound the meat). I then dipped them in non fat milk and then to the bread crumb mix.

Used an Italian bread crumb mix and added cayenne pepper (about 1/2-3/4 tsp) and mixed it all together with about a 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan and Romano cheese.

I noted that a couple people mentioned the chicken was soggy on the bottom so I baked it on a cookie drying rack on top of a baking sheet (to catch the run off).

It was perfectly cooked in 30 min and is about the best this I've ever made. Thank you for the initial recipe and for everyone's suggestions

This was a definate dinner party pleaser! I tested in on a group of friends and we all loved it. Next time I will place the meat on a grate so that it isnt sitting in it's own juice because that made them a little less crispy.

This was fabulous!!  Husband commented this was restaurant quality!!  I made the following changes with success: I used (6) boneless breasts and pounded them thin. I placed a slice of deli ham on the chicken breast and then spread the cream cheese on the ham.  I topped with shredded Cheddar cheese and rolled the bundles up. I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much as written except I cooked the chicken for 1 hour and when the chicken was done I removed it from the casserole dish and strained the sauce over bowtie pasta to use as the sauce. Would HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

Personally I didn't like this recipe but my husband loved it.  I thought it was too rich and greasy (because of the butter sauce on top).  I pounded my chicken breast out at the advice of other's and it seemed to cook pretty quickly and was nice and moist.  I also put lots more lemon and used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  If I make it again, I think I will cut way down on the amount of butter and perhaps I will like it better.  I'm still glad I gave it a try!

Prepared this tonight, and everyone loved it! Very easy to make which says a lot given I'm a beginner. I read other reviews and made a few modifications .. I seasoned both sides of the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, then topped it with a layer of cream cheese (cut a little thinner than recommended) and shredded cheddar. Next time, I'll use sharp cheddar for added flavor. I rolled the mixture up, securing it with toothpicks, then followed the recipe using fresh Parmesan instead of Romano. Definitely adding this to the collection. Thanks!

Very enjoyable dish! My husband said it tasted "gourmet". I do have a few suggestions though. First, definitely, season the chicken breast itself with salt, pepper, and whatever other herbs or spices that you like. In addition, I would also season the bread crumb and romano (I used parmesan) mixture with a small amount of, again, whatever you like. I used very small amounts of onion powder, oregano, and basil on both the chicken and in the bread crumb mixture. Secondly, as other reviewers suggested, I pounded the chicken breasts, put in the cream cheese and cheddar, rolled it up, and secured it with toothpicks. Since the breats are thinner they cook faster, so keep an eye on them. This really was moist and flavorful chicken. The cream cheese and cheddar sounds strange together, but it was terrific. Next time I am going to try an herbed cream cheese!

this was great. i didn't have the cheddar and romano cheeses on hand but i used what i had and they worked beautifully. i used thin chicken breast and then wrapped them around the cheese and put toothpicks in them to hold it together. i had to cook them a little longer just to make sure they were done completely, but they were perfect when they came out. my husband loved this, even my picky daughter cleaned her plate on this one. so this will be a staple recipe in my home. thanks for this one it's a keeper.

What an awesome dish that was so simple to prepare.  The only modification I would make to this one is instead of sandwiching the cheeses between the chicken I would rather pound the chicken flat, fill, then roll the chicken so there is less oozing.  Most of my cheddar cheese fell out causing it burn on the sides of the pan.  Other than that minor mistake, this dish was excellent.  My husband who is one of the pickiest eaters even loved it.  Thanks.

just tried this recipe; substituted parmesian cheese for romano.  Came out excellent, nice and moist.  Great recipe because you have most of the ingredients in house.

My guests thought that this was a fantastic recipe and were still talking about it the next day! My family enjoyed it, but thought that it was a bit too much cream cheese and I didn't use the full amount, so I'll probably reduce that amount even more next time. Overall, it was a hit and I've been asked to make it again.

I made this tonight, everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was saute some shallots and add them to the lemon butter sauce. It was very good.

Baked up 2 breasts. The lemon juice/flavor was pretty much evaporated once the baking was done, I will try again with adding the sauce later, or at lease the lemon juice. But the breasts were tender and tasty from the garlic side of things. I would like to generate more sauce for adding to the rice in the future and may add some spices to the cheese "stuffing".

Delicious recipe  - everyone loved it.  I would use plain panko crumbs next time as my personal preference vs italian pre- flavored.  I would probably use a bit less than 1oz each cream and cheddar cheese per Breast too.  The buttery lemon sauce on top was amazing and the recipe as quick and easy to make.  Highly recommend.

Much as I am surprised to say it, we found a it a little too much cheese using this recipe. The family loved it but next time I make it, I will cut the cheese stuffing by 1/2.

I've made this several times according to the recipe and it's good, but the last time I drifted a bit and it became phenomenal. For the garlic butter sauce I kept the butter at the original amount but doubled the garlic and lemon to bring out more of the flavors, and I was out of cheddar cheese at the time so I substituted it for pepper jack cheese slices with whipped cream cheese with 2 green onions added to the mix. The taste was so good that my husband has asked for it several times. The pepper jack and green onions really give it a more dynamic flavor along with the tanginess of the lemon.

all I can say is WOW!!!!! absolutely delicious! the only 2 changes I made was that instead of soaking the breasts in milk I spread a thin layer of hellman's lowfat may since that made the topping stick to the chicken and keep it very moist and instead of solid cheddar I used shredded. everything else was followed to a T. I made it last night and again today. It is probably one of the best chicken dishes I ever had.

Tried this for a dinner party - it went over so well that our guest's boyfriend tried to convince her to come over and check for leftovers the next morning! I added shredded baby kale inside the chicken and used lemon flavored panko bread crumbs.

Very Delish.     I did roll it up.    A little more lemon juice and a little less cream cheese.    My son came back
For a 2nd helping.    Definitely a keeper and very
Easy to make.    Thanks for finally a great stuffed chicken recipe

Truly Amazing! This has replaced my whole family's favorite dish, even my 5 yr old LOVED it! I did however change a few things like other reviewers suggested. I only used 3oz of cream cheese and I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. I cut the milk in half and added two eggs and beat it all together. I also used chicken tenderloins and beat them flat and rolled it I held them together with toothpicks. I thought the butter mixture would be too much but I wasn't. I did however pour half on top before cooking and mid way through I coated the chicken rolls with the remainder of the butter mixture. Loved loved loved this recipe! I will be making this quite often.

I flattened it out also. Other than that, followed the recipe! We loved it, but it is definitely very filling. I made rice and used the broth from the baking dish to drizzle over the rice, definitely a keeper!

Great recipe as is, but I, like others, cut the cream cheese in half. I also added some Swiss, Monterey Jack, and fresh Parmesan to the cheese stuffing. More cheese is ALWAYS better. I also baked it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 20-30 minutes. ( I  want my chicken well done! :) ) Enjoy time and again!

A new family favorite! I stuff those suckers right full of cheese and use whatever breading I have on hand (season it). And I find it needs just a bit longer to cook so I boiled the breasts for 20 minutes first.

that was a winner. followed directions exactly, though did cut it down for two people. needed 33-35 min in the oven but was cooked just wonderfully. too much breading mixture, though. would think about making less.

This was a huge hit at my home! I followed the recipe with the exception of adding minced garlic to the butter mixture. I love cream cheese so I will add even more the next time I fix it. This was so yummy that my thirty-something daughter said it was the best chicken dish I've ever made!

So tasty! I halved the cream cheese, as others suggested, but it was still a lot. I quartered it the second time I made it and it was much better. Also, I added real bacon bits to the cheese mixture the second time and that was a hit! I rolled up thin-cut chicken breasts and secured with a toothpick (increasing cooking time by 5-10 minutes) as others did - this looks so fancy!

I enjoyed this recipe but I did make some changes: I used thin sliced chicken breasts because I never have any luck trying to butterfly the thicker ones.  I pound them a little thinner if need be and place the filling in the middle and roll in both sides.  I filled with creamcheese and a slice of sharp chedder.  I wrapped each piece of chicken in bacon instead of breading them which was sufficient enough to keep the breasts closed.  Halfway through the baking process I poured the butter lemon mixture over the top.  At the very end, I broiled them for a few minutes to brown and crisp the bacon.  Delish!

I make this regularly, it is so delicious and so easy!  Often chicken breasts are dry and this recipe provides a way to make them tasty.  Too much butter though - I had to toss some because the coating couldn't absorb as much as was called for.

This was SO good!  I followed a previous recommendation and just dipped the chicken in the butter/lemon mixture, then drizzled the rest on top.  I also omitted the minced garlic and romano cheese, because I was out of them, but the flavor was still incredible.  This will be added to my list of things I will serve dinner guests.

I made this with a really high quality artisan smoked cheddar, and I think it would have been better if I had just used plain cheddar instead.  The cheese kind of overpowered the rest of the dish.  Still, it was very good, but not my favorite compared to some other stuffed chicken dishes I have made.

This dish has become my signature dish for special occasions in our family.  It is flawless.  I don't mind that the cheese melts out a bit. I usually place my cheddar on top of my cream cheese, since it takes longer to melt.  I love making this for friends for the first time.. they all walk away thinking I'm a great cook....  well - ok, I'll take some credit.

Husband proclaimed this delicious, so thank you, thank you, thank you!  My tweaks:  like others, I used panko, mixing in a generous amount of Italian herb seasoning and Romano cheese.  When coating chicken, I always line my baking pan with foil and spray a rack with Pam, cooking the chicken above the foil.  Makes top and bottom crust nice and crunchy.  I used cream cheese and smoked mozzarella, smooshing the cheeses over the meat until it went almost to the edge.  After dipping in milk and dredging, I sprinkled the remaining crumbs over the top.  Went light with the butter, with more lemon juice, and seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  The chicen was pretty thick, so I roasted at 400* (convection) for 30 minutes, and it turned out perfectly.  Husband and I are both cheese fanatics, so I can see endless possibilities!

This was killlllaaaa.  I used 5 large chicken breasts sliced in half then i made them into pinwheels instead of butterflying them.  I used 1/2 the amount required for the cream cheese, used Panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs and added lemon rosemary seasoning to them.  Before putting them in the oven I put a lemon slice on top of each pinwheel.   Served over thin spaghetti and used the butter from the pan as sauce.  AMAZING!

Good. Did not have any Romano so I substitued some Italian shredded cheese. Juice of one lemon gave me 2 1/2 T. so I used it all since we love lemon butter! Very good recipe.  Served with fetticini noodles, brocolli and lettuce salad.

Delicious! My kids love these (well, my super picky eater doesn't, but the other two do), and every time I cook these for someone else, they give it rave reviews. I use panko instead but besides that, I make it the same! Delicious!

Everyone liked this one a lot.  My only changes were to use shredded cheddar "mashed" in with the cream cheese, plus added garlic, lemon pepper, onion powder and parmesan.  Oh, and I used Panko crumbs.  But I think to bring it over the top, I'll make extra sauce for plating next time, maybe with a splash of white wine for good measure.

This recipe is good and I love the idea/concept behind it. I was more or so looking for a base recipe for some stuffed chicken. I hate when people change the recipe, so I did try it as per recipe except for pounding and rolling the chicken instead of bookstyle and it was okay. There was something missing with the filling. The breading was great. What would make the recipe awesome, would be to soften the creamcheese a little and add shredded cheddar, some garlic salt (needs salt!!). Mix the filling together and the add to the chicken. Most of my cheddar came out and left just the cream cheese- which seemed bland since there were no seasonings at all inside, all of it is for the breading! Great starter recipe, to add new things and try your own variations.

This was the first time I'd stiffed chicken before.  I'm not afraid to try it now.  I marinated the chicken overnight in olive oil, the juice from one lemon, two garlic cloves, and some rosemary.  Butterflied them and put in plenty of cream cheese and shredded cheddar cheese.  Then I dipped them in italian bread crumbs mixed with some fresh grated parmesan and romano cheese.  Baked for a little while and then poured some butter on top and finished baking.  So good!  Thank you!  My whole family loved these!

I'd give this somewhere between a 4 and a 5 - only because of the amount of butter and fat.  Loved the taste, and that the chicken breast (which is usually too dry for me) was moist. I added way more garlic than it called for, but that's my standard MO!   Wonder if there's some way to cut down on the butter in the garlic-lemon butter sauce.

I love this dish! My boyfriend loves it so much he asked me to make it for his mom the first time I met her and it was a huge hit! Its easy and the cheesy filling is delicious. To make it a little crispier I skip the butter and only sprinkle lemon juice and a little garlic powder on top (the first time the butter inhibited the crunchiness).

Very good recipe.  The only thing I did different was flatten the chicken instead of butterflying it.  For me it is a little easier because you just put the cheeses on one of the flat sides of the chicken,  roll it up and stick a toothpick in it.  The flavors of the chicken are very good.

This was wonderful. Toothpicks worked well to hold it all in. We all loved it. I have never done anything like this before (stuffing chicken breasts), but it was shockingly easy. I was so impressed with myself, and it was delicious. I caught my husband eating the leftovers. After 10 years he has never eaten the leftovers!

I loved this dish!  I took the suggestions of others and cut the cream cheese but made sure it was spreadable.  I used the pre-sliced cheddar snack slices which worked perfectly.  I also increased the lemon.  Yummy!  The flavors blended very well.  I will be making this dish again.

Wow!  This was amazing! My husband gave it 10 stars!  I marinated the chicken in buttermilk and lemon juice.  I did have to cook mine a litter longer, maybe my oven.  I added the paprika and garlic salt (and pepper) to the bread crumb mixture.  Then added more paprika on top of chicken in the cooking dish.  This gave it a great color.  Oh, I broiled the chicken in the end for a crisp top.  Yummy.

5 star! Higher if I could rate it! I cut the recipe in half, but used 5 smaller breast, rather than the called for 4. Pounded them flat and then rolled them and secured with toothpicks, rather than butterflying and stuffing. Used only 3 oz of cream cheese (1/3 less fat) cut into 5 slices. Used less than the mentioned cheddar cheese too, and used shredded cheese.  Just filled until I thought they were full, didnt really measure. Used homemade bread crumbs from the Garlic Bread recipe on this site and added a few shakes of italian seasoning.  Used fresh grated parmesan cheese rather than ramano since that was what I had on hand. Used a little extra lemon and 2 tsp garlic in sauce. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, then put under high broiler for 2 minutes to crispen top. Amazing recipe! WIll make again for sure. Thanks!

I decided to rate this recipe on the way that it was written.  i gave it four stars because my guests and I both believed there was to much garlic (over powered the lemon) and cheese.  The second time I made this I used less cream cheese (approx. a small cut into a bar of cream cheese for each piece of chicken).  I also used less cheddar per piece (I used sharp cheddar).   The garlic I love, but I know that others may not like the strong taste that over powered the lemon.  So I cut down on the garlic a bit. This recipe is very easy to make.  I will definitely make it again.

I scaled the recipe to 2 servings and filled 3 small chicken breasts.  I added lemon zest and a small clove of garlic to the cheese mixture and in the end, we thought this recipe was just ok.

Easy and delicious!  My husband said it was 'restaraunt good' and can't wait for me to make it again.  I admit I didn't measure my cheeses, just put in what looked right, and also put some of the breading in with the cheese to help it from running out.

This is an excellent recipe!  I've made it at least three times since I found it, and it always turns out wonderful.  I didn't really measure the cheese, I just put a piece of each inside the chicken, and it was great!

If I could rate highly than 5, I would!  This is Heavenly!  I changed the recipe slightly.  I didn't have any minced garlic so i used some minced onion and garlic powder.  I did not measure the lemon juice I just poured some in the pan (I love lemon flavor!).  I used the thick boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut a slit in each; put the cream cheese and cheddar cheese slices inside the chicken and used toothpicks to hold it shut.  I dipped it in the milk and breadcrumbs and then poured the garlic, onion, lemon mixed over top the chicken in the baking pan.  I cooked it for 45 minutes and IT IS WONDERFUL!  Serve it with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and garlic & cheese biscuits and you have the best meal ever!  My whole family loves it and you smell garlic throughout the house!  Thanks for the great recipe, I will definately be making this again many times!

This recipe is so yummy!  I originally made it for company, but it has now become a family favorite.  I do cut the cream cheese in half and I always use light cream cheese.  Also, I only use about 1/3 the amount of butter called for. Otherwise, it is swimming in butter, which is unnecessary and adds a lot of fat to the recipe.  Also, I add more garlic , as we love a lot of garlic!  This is A fantastic recipe!!!

Very delicious.  I trimmed it down for two people and added a chipolte seasoning to the cream cheese.  It gave it a nice smoky spice that was awesome.
Thanks!

This was awesome!  I didn't have cheddar, so I used colby jack which was just a little bland, so I will use cheddar next time.  Also didn't have lemon, so used lime instead.  Did cut back on the cream cheese as others had recommended and also pounded the chicken out and used toothpicks rather than cutting butterfly. Overall a great recipe, even my picky eaters ate it.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good taste, and easy to prepare.  The lemon and garlic drizzled on top with the butter add a nice zip.  My husband gave it two thumbs up.

SOOOO GOOD!!!
After reading the other reviews, we decided to cut back on the amount of cheese and just kinda did it by eye.  We also used chive and onion cream cheese and mozz instead of cheddar and we wouldn't change anything else...A keeper for sure!! five stars

Absolutely fantastic! The cream cheese was a bit strong tasting, but I love cream cheese, so that didn't bother me in the least.  The sauce in the pan after removing the chicken was perfect for pouring onto angel hair pasta, and tossing with parm cheese. 

I butterflied the breasts, then cut the cheeses in half long ways, so that it wasn't so thick.

I have made this a few times also. My family LOVED it! I did make a few changes. I shredded the cheddar, and blended it with the cream cheese. I then made a "pocket" in the breast, and stuffed the pocket with the cheeses. It lost a lot less cheese that way, and was easy. I also cooked for about 45 min.I have given this recipe to other family memebers after my hubby raved over it. Thanks for the recipe. Definately a keeper at my house!

This is delicious! I love the cheeses and the lemon flavor together.When baked in the oven, it does have a crispy coating. I LOVE lemons and I add more for my taste. I use more fresh garlic instead of garlic sauce. The only thing is it doesn't really make a sauce. I will continue to tweek that part of it. Otherwise, a great recipe.Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!!!!  This is a dish to make when you need to impress someone (like a mother-in-law).  My kids loved it and loved when the cream cheese would squish out while cutting the chicken.  It went great with rice.  Poored the sauce from the pan onto the rice.  We are garlic freaks at this house so we weren't upset that the garlic over powered the lemon.  Next time I'll put more cream cheese inside, love cream cheese too!  Thank you soooo much for this recipe.  About a half hour to prepare it, it's worth it!

Just finished dinner with a friend for which I made this recipe for the first time.  A BIG HIT!  I had to cook the chicken closer to 45 minutes before it was done.  I prepared some rice and added it to the baking dish around the chicken (to soak up the juices and the cheese) for the last 10 minutes.  All of the tastes blended together to make a wonderful dish. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

This is by far the best recipe I have ever made from this site.  I have cooked 3 times in the last two weeks!  It is the best chicken recipe that I own now, and I will be cooking it for many years to come. The first time I cooked it my husband said that it had too much cream cheese, so I cut it in half the next time I made it and now loves this recipe also.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband, I would not try it because I knew it had cream cheese (I'm finicky) but after every bite all he said was "I've died and gone to heaven" So I guess that says it all! Thx

I made this recipe as the first real dinner I had ever made for my family (I'm a high school graduate, c/o 2004).  This recipe was so easy and it tasted so good that I had to promise to make it all the time now.  It was great!

My hubby hates cream cheese, but just don't tell!! He raved about this; I used parmesan cheese instead of romano, and just spiced regular bread crumbs with spicy Mrs. Dash; also, cooked for 45 minutes, and was not dry at all. YUM!

I made the recipe as directed- the only thing I modified was the oven temp and cooking time. I cooked at 450 degrees for 20-22 minutes. It came out perfectly juicy and browned on the top. I upped the degrees because you are pouring lemon and butter sauce on top of chicken coated in parm and breadcrumbs...in my experience, if you cook on too low of heat, you get soggy coating.
One thing I would change in the future is just a tad more seasoning...probably just add some extra salt on top of chicken in addition to what recipe calls for. Otherwise, this was a huge hit at our house and super easy!

I have to confess that I let my imagination run amok.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because I had them on hand.  Instead of cream cheese, I laid the thighs open, seasoned the inside of each with S, P, and a little garlic powder, then placed half a slice of ham off the bone on each, followed by a slice of swiss cheese, and followed that with a half slice of sharp cheddar.  I then rolled up each thigh (no toothpick required) and placed them seam side down in a pre-sprayed quiche dish, seasoned the outsides as I did the insides, did the melted butter/lemon juice on each, followed by garlic and herb bread crumbs and baked 25 mins at 350.  I pulled the dish out, laid a half slice of swiss on top of each thigh, then back into the oven for about 4-5 mins until cheese was melted.  OH, SO GOOD!!!!!!

Made this recipe last week and I will say it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe as directed and yet it took the chicken a bit longer to cook than stated, it was very good. I used cream cheese and cheddar as a mix of cheeses. Cheers!

The whole family liked it! That is a near Impossible feat! I followed the video and cut recipe in half. Would love to get a taste of filling in every bite though so I my pound out chicken and roll up, as another reviewer suggested. Really delicious!

SUPER good!  Maybe just half the cream cheese though, but the sharp cheddar, Romano cheese really made it so so good. I'm sending this to my Mom.  Thx for posting this!  This is my first 'rating!'

Have made this several times and it is a HUGH hit every time. I have found it easier for me to flatten out the chicken breast by placing them in a freezer bag and use a kitchen mallet. I then roll the cheeses up in breast before I bread them and place in the dish. Some of the times when I make this dish I add a thinly sliced piece of ham to wrap the cheeses in before I wrap them in the chicken breast. This gives it a kind of cordon bleu twist.

I had everything on hand and was going to make cordon blue, but this recipe appealed to me...my family are cheese lovers.  I think you should always season the chicken and lightly flour before dipping & breading for better flavor and better adhesive of the breading.  I also used low fat cheeses and thawed and squeezed out the moisture of frozen spinach and added a bit to the filling for color and at least some nutrient.  Next time I'll get smaller breasts as they are quite rich.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I recommend is going a little lighter on the cream cheese.  It's a meal that's pretty easy to make but it seems like a lot of work went into it. :)

The prep time and cook time is a bit off in my opinion.   I cooked this the other night.  It took 30 min prep and 60-70 to cook for me.  I always want to make sure my chicken is all the way cooked.  The chicken wasn't dry and the flavors was pretty good.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 stars is bc I've had better chicken.   But this dish is worthy of 5...ah 5 it is lol.  btw u should mix the romano cheese and breed crumbs together and spread it on the bottom of the casserole dish.  After dipping the chicken in the milk place the chicken in the casserole dish and cover the chicken with the bread crumbs and romano.  Much easier and cleaner.

Very good, but messy. I followed the recipe, and most of the cheese oozed out of the chicken while it was baking. Also, the chicken seemed to take a bit longer to bake - about 50 minutes.

My daughter will be attending college this Fall 2015 so easy dinner is a must. So I have been searching for easy recipes and this one was by far super easy and so good we loved it (5 stars. Very simple dinner was ready in less than one hour. We didn't change a thing although I may use Panko crumbs next time instead of the bread crumbs.

Tthis was WAY too much cheese! Next time we make it, we plan on getting shredded cheddar cheese and combining it with the cream cheese then stuffing that in the chicken. All the cheddar melted out,. But we will definitely try it again!

This was good. I think we will tweak some things next time. The taste of the outer breaded part was awesome but the inside needed something. Maybe garlic, additional spices or some pepper jack. We also ended up with HUGE chicken breasts from the store so it took forever to cook. Next time we will use smaller ones. Definitely a do over dish!

Like someone else suggested, I also flattened it out and rolled a shredded cheese/cream cheese mixture inside. It was delicious! Very, very rich, but delicious. I couldnt help but to finish my entire giant piece. Would definitely make again, and this time would definitely attempt not to finish all of it. Lotta calories in this!

This was delicious!  I will make this again for sure.  I used fresh parmamigiano on top of the bread crumbs instead of mixing it in.  I also rolled in a cooked slice of bacon which made it even more devine.  The only thing I will change next time is use half the cream cheese or swap it for another cheese..maybe swiss.  Big hit..worth a try and easy to make!

This is a phenomenal recipe.
My husband now BEGS ME for this for every occasion...
"Honey it's a Tuesday, that means stuffed chicken!"
I used this exact recipe once, now I've been following my own version of it for a while now.
It's a good bit of prepping- but what I don't think many people realize is that it actually FREEZES well! I just ate one a frozen and cooked for an hour earlier!

I buy my chicken, butterfly open (or buy thin and roll and hold with tooth picks)

In a separate bowl I mix 1 block of cream cheese and half a bag of shredded cheddar cheese.

In another separate bowl I have milk, then in another I have Italian Bread Crumbs.

I stuff, dunk in milk, roll in bread crumbs then lay on a pan.

I squeeze fresh lemons and mix fresh grated pepper in it.

I then drizzle the dressing over the chicken breast.
Then I add a few sprinkles of garlic salt and paprika over it.

The recipe she listed is PHENOMENAL! And I've used it for so long, ^ above is just what it's turned into now.

excellent stuffed chicken!! Wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the lemon taste. But sure did like it, also family loved it and was told I should make it again!  The cream cheese in the center of the chicken made it so creamy! Totally recommend!!

This was very delicious! Like everyone else, I made several changes. I only stuffed it with Mild cheddar to cut the calories from using both cheeses. Salted the inside and outside of the chicken and seasoned the inside with a season mix. From past experiences, if you don't season and salt it comes out very bland. I didn't have milk so I coated my chicken with eggs and added grated parm to my italian bread crumbs. Opted out on the butter with garlic to cut down on calories. I love lemons so after the chicken was almost done cooking I drizzled fresh lemon juice over it. My chicken came out golden and crispy and very moist. Great base recipe.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!!! I've made it for just my family of four and for a dinner party with the in laws. Even my husbands picky grandma ate it all and asked for seconds. 

I do tend to add a little more garlic and lemon- but I eyeball everything when cooking and we love garlic. This recipe is great for entertaining and for a family night in. Takes a while to get everything ready, but it's super simple and I get the chicken ready earlier in the day then add the sauce later before cooking. Great recipe!!

As noted by other reviewers, cut down the portions! I used about 1/2 of the 8 oz cream cheese between 3 large breasts, and I did use mild shredded cheddar only I cut my breast partially in half from the back then cut the breasts open from the middle so the back was kind of like a pair of doors. I found the cream cheese stayed inside the chicken very well but the cheddar did not. The next time I try this I will also put some cheddar in first, then the cream cheese, then a layer of cheddar so that if the bottom layer falls out again, at least there will be one of the cheddar and the cream cheese. 

ALSO, YOU DO NOT NEED SO MUCH BUTTER! OH MY GOSH! NO! I cut the butter to 1/2 a cup and that was too much! I will only use a quarter next time. I also used half of a lemon, I didn't even measure but I didn't taste it much so I will just chalk it up to the whole thing next time. Also we love garlic so I put in more than what it asked for and the garlic didn't burn and actually tasted really nicely coarsely chopped on top of the chicken.

Aside from making this recipe not so much of an artery blocker, it was really delicious! It was simple and my family loved it.

Sooooooo delicious! I made this and everyone loved it. As someone said mentioned in a review, the cream cheese was a bit overwhelming so I suggest halting the cream cheese and we used a tablespoon more of lemon juice for flavor. It was sooo good.

I cut the breasts in half and made two out of each breast. I used more minced garlic then called for, probably 3 to 4 tablespoons. I used a big cast iron pan to bake in, and I doubled the time, I baked a good hour. All of the rest I followed the same. This was some of the best chicken I have ever tasted. My husband and daughter loved it also. The recipe is a keeper and I will make this at least once a month. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The flavor was awesome. I asked my husband if he wanted to squeeze some extra lemon on top and he said no..it is perfect, it cannot get any better. Only sorry I didn't take a picture, it looked cookbook ready. I served it with mashed potatoes that I added some crumpled bacon and sharp cheddar cheese to.

I had a really hard time closing the chicken around the cheeses, so I think next time I'll use a meat mallet. Otherwise, this was absolutely 5 stars 100% INCREDIBLE! I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was out of this world. My husband said it was the best chicken he's ever had, from anywhere. I would agree that it's on up there--better than a lot of restaurant chicken dishes I've had. I would suggest dumping the rest of the coating on the chicken before cooking, though. Coating it as the recipe called for just didn't leave enough taste for us, and it has some delicious flavors in it!

We really loved this! I only made enough for 2, but I should have made a full recipe because I'm sure they will reheat great! I only did a few things differently... I didn't measure either cream cheese, or cheddar (used shredded). I just sprinkled what looked like enough cheese and spread the same with cream cheese. Also I did not pound and roll the chicken like others recommend, but I'm sure it's awesome like that as well. I did use tooth picks to hold the breast together while it baked and it helped so much not letting the cheese melt out! Making a full recipe tonight!

Incredibly delicious. Loved all of the flavor and it was super juicy and easy to make. Will definitely make again soon. Served with rice and french-cut green beans, drizzled extra sauce over these.

This is the one thing my husband requests for dinner all the time. Big hit, and he's a picky eater so he's hard to cook for! I only had shredded cheddar, so I stuffed that in instead of a slice. Still comes out great.

This was really good and really easy to make.  I followed the receipe except I used shredded cheese and a mixture of greek yogurt and cream cheese because I did not have enough cream cheese.  The chicken was moist.  I would have liked the breading to brown a bit more, but I did not want the chicken to dry out.  My boyfriend and I both loved it.

Very good! I cut the cheese slices (both the cream cheese and cheddar) too thick and it led to a bit of saltiness. Had I not killed the recipe it would've been awesome. I will do it again and leave the "more is better" attitude at the door. LOL

My family all loved this stuffed chicken.  I halved the recipe, but used the full 2tbsp of lemon juice and a full tbsp of crushed garlic. Took Advice of another reviewer and skipped the milk. Just dipped the stuffed chicken in the melted butter/lemon/garlic mixture then in the Italian bread crumbs (which I mixed with parmesan).  It took 40-45mins to cook.  Will make again for sure!!

I just made this, and I really liked it! I made more of a a pocket with mine, and decreased the cream cheese to 1/4 of the block. I would recommend a little more cream cheese than that though. I also used shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I also let my 8 halves cook for an hour. They came out very moist

Wonderful!! I pounded out the chicken since some of the chicken breasts were too small & thin to cut. I used fat free crm cheese & shredded fiesta mix cheese along with turkey bacon bits as filler. I dipped the chicken in eggs instead of milk because the crumbs stick better and rolled them in a Panko/parm. mix. Only change to the sauce was a little extra garlic...yummy! Very messy making and no points for presentation but OMG DELICIOUS!! Chicken came out crunchy, moist and tasty!! Family loved it and I will be making this again!

Normally anything is 3/4 c of butter doesn't get a second look from me but I decided to lighten up this recipe and it turned out great.  Here's how:
* Use cooking spray to "grease" the pan
* Use reduced fat (1/3 less) cream cheese rather than full fat
* Use 2% shredded cheese (I used Colby Jack because that's what I had)
* Skip dunking the breasts in milk.  If you haven't dried them, they will be moist enough to dredge in bread crumbs and cheese.
* Drizzle lemon juice (I probably used 2 T for 2 breasts) directly on to breasts (skipping the butter altogether), then sprinkle garlic and paprika directly on the breasts in the pan.

My whole family loved this recipe, and believe me finding a recipe that everyone in my family loves is a task unto itself. 

I made a few adjustments though, and they are: 

Instead of Italian Bread Crumbs I used Panko, Japanese Style Bread Crumbs, Plain.

For the Cheddar Cheese I used Cabot's Seriously Sharp Cheddar and of Course, Philadelphia Cream Cheese. I used Bel Gioioso Freshly Shredded Romano Cheese to add to the Panko. 

The Recipe called for baking for 30 minutes, but the breasts I used were rather thick and still slightly frozen in the center, so my baking time was about an hour. Well worth the wait though, it was perfect.

I also made the Country Apple Dumplings for dessert that night, it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

Oh my goodness was this awsome. I've never took the time to rate any of the food I cook on here but I had to do this one. The only thing I changed was added a little less cream cheese then written. Oh I didn't have grated romona cheese so I used grated parmesan. Thank you for such a delicious recipe.

I made this when my in-laws were visiting.  My mother-in-law has a very small appetite and actually had seconds!  My husband, who claims not to be a chicken lover, also had seconds!  I was just happy I made enough:) The meal received such raves. I did replace the cheddar cheese with pepper jack cheese, because that is what I had on hand.  Fabulous!!!

Just made this tonight and it turned out fabulous! From start to finish it was delish and easy! All i changed was the cheese-i only had white cheddar, so i stacked up some slices and cut long strips to stuff into the chicken. I dipped the stuffed chicken in milk and lightly breaded it in the breadcrumbs. Cooked it for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. The best part of this dish is the very end when you have ooey gooey cheese left over to smother all over your veggies!

Pretty good, but all the cheddar melted out into the pan, and the cream cheese was a bit overpowering.

This is fabulous! I used crushed seasoned croutons in place of the bread crumbs and did it as a casserole bake with chunks of chicken and dollops of cream cheese, poured on the milk, layered the cheese and the crushed croutons and then poured on the butter and lemon juice.  My family declared this their favorite chicken recipe ever.  I will definitely include this in my cooking routine.

I made this last night on my wife's suggestion. Very easy and tasted great. Wife couldn't believe how good it was. Even the 4 and 6 year old enjoyed it.

I cooked the recipe almost to the T. The slight changes I made was PARM instead of Romano. I spread the cream cheese in the chicken and put in shredded cheddar. Overall VERY good dish... served with corn on the cob and steamed broccoli.

Next time I think I'll try a spicer version. :)

I did have to make some modifications due to what I had on hand.  Basically omitted the breading, but otherwise followed fairly close. I didn't really get much of the lemon or garlic flavor.  Just OK.  Didn't like it enough to try again with the breading.

Not my favorite. Tasted okay. For some reason mine came out pretty salty, not sure why, followed recipe and didn't add anything. Was a bit heavy and rich for me.

Very easy to make and tasty.
My 8 yrs twins cleaned their plates.
Unfortunately, after 8 breasts, I still had 1/2 the bread crumbs left that I had to throw away.
Definitely, I'll make it again.

I am not sure what I did wrong.  I followed the directions exactly, but my cheese ended up in the pan instead of in the chicken.  Securing it with a toothpick or something probably would have solved that problem.  I also think this was way too cream-cheesy.  I will make this again, but I'll figure out a way to keep the cheese from falling out, and I will use way less cream cheese or possibly just replace it with some other kind of cheese.  It smelled delicious while cooking, just didn't taste very good.

REALLY tasty. Use a long, shallow baking dish, even if you halve the recipe. I used a 9x9 and the juices made it too soppy. Hubby said it was my best dish yet, even so!

As many have already commented this is EXCELLENT and easy.  I had some leftover cream cheese in the frig & didn't measure, just used what was there.  The butter/garlic sauce is awesome!!  My breasts weren't exactly tiny but were so moist once cooked.  This will definitely go in the regular rotation!

Got 5 stars from the family I prepared this for !!!!!  I didn't have solid cheddar cheese, but the shredded worked well I think!  I was told this is the best chicken recipe I've ever made! Thanks so much!!!!!!!!  So easy!!!

This was pretty good!  I do agree with others the the cream cheese could be reduced and next time I make it I will reduce the cream cheese maybe by alittle less than half.  As far as the chicken breasts, they vary so much in size anymore.  I had 3 chicken breasts from SAMs to totaling 2.5lbs.  I certainly was not going to use eight of those! if I would have used eight of those giant breasts perhaps there wouldn't have been too much cream cheese.   I sliced the chicken breasts in half to make 6 peices and then pounded them thin enough to fold up with the cheeses.  My brests fit snugly in a 9x13 dish, which I think helped to keep the cheeses in.  Over all a good recipe!

This was pretty good.  I did't use the garlic salt and it turned out great. I did see a recommendation using panko instead of seasoned breadd crumbs and I think I will try that next time.  Overall a good recipe that I will do again with a few tweeks.

I've made a lot of delicious recipes from this site~ but this is the best! I did follow some other suggestions & added seasonings to the bread crumbs & to the melted butter - added garlic & onion as well. Used garlic herb spread & a thin slice of ham. I didn't use the toothpicks & it did seep out some- but it is still delicious!

I made this for the first time last night.  This is a quick way to prepare chicken, is one of the most delicious chicken breast recipes I have ever tried, and it has a real touch of elegance appropriate for a company meal.  I changed a couple of things just for my own taste.  I used Kraft's 3 cheese mix, Asian panko bread crumbs, heavy whipping cream in place of the milk, and I omitted the lemon juice.  I also used aluminum foil to line a cookie sheet which I greased with real butter. Love it!

My very picky son said it was the best chicken he has ever had. I sent the left overs home for him. The next morning my 4 year old woke up and wanted it for breakfest. She cried when I told her we didn't have any.

Left out the cheddar and used the juice of one large lemon instead of just two Tbsps and it was incredible!

I'm only a college student and not an experienced cook by any means & followed this recipe exact minus the garlic and lemon part, (only cause I didn't have the ingridents for it but am definitely looking forward to making it that way soon), and can I just say this recipe was amazing! It was not only delicious as my family and my boyfriend agree, but it made me seem like a very experienced cook! It is definitely a remake!!!

My husband liked it.  I thought it was way too cheesy.  I would have liked it if the cheese stufing was left out all together.  Feb 2012

I made this last night for myself and my VERY picky roomate...it was a HIT! and SUPER easy! The only thing I changed was I used Cream Cheese cooking creme, as I didn't have a block of cream cheese. I just put a dollop in the middle of each butterflied breast. It did ooze, but it only made the garlic butter sauce better! I even added some of the cooking creme to the garlic lemon butter sauce when I was sauteeing the garlic before I poured it over the chicken. I did add extra lemon juice, but that is because I love lemon! This is definately going into the rotation!

The secret to this amazing recipe must be the cream cheese! I veered WAY off the recipe and it came out just as yummy as all the reviews I had read stated it would, this is a definite keeper! I used just a smear of cream cheese in the pocket of each butterflied chicken breast, a slice of cheddar and a few bacon pieces. Dipped the chicken in the lemon butter before panko bread crumbs. VERY GOOD!

It was very good. I am not sure about adding the sauce right from the beginning, though. For me, it just made a big mess in the pan and there was hardly any left to use over the side pilaf I was serving. I added diced green bell pepper and dill in the filling.

This Chicken dish is AMAZING, I did change a few things though. I pounded the chicken after cutting it in half so I could roll and I added bacon in the middle as well which was so good. My husband and kids really enjoyed it . Oh I also added grated smoked Gouda instead of Romano because i was all out but it tasted so good. I do recommend You try it out for yourself , it's so easy to change to fit your families likes

Probably the best chicken we've ever had! I cut strips of cream cheese the long way and it was fine but they were pretty huge breasts.  I used 3 garlic bulbs and 1  1/2 lemons.  I also baked at 375 for most of the time since I was running late.  Deserves 6 stars!

OMG!! This was absolutely phenomenal!  I had to make the following substitutions due to lack of ingredients for a serving of 4:
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs and had to add ¼ cup crushed Ritz crackers and 1 tbsp. italian dressing mix as I had no seasoned bread crumbs
Added 2 tsp. real bacon crumbles to each chicken breast pocket.  
Following other reviewer’s advice, I only used ½ the cream cheese and used approximately 2 tbsp. shredded cheddar cheese in each breast.   
Toothpicks kept breaking so I found some long wooden skewers and wover them into the edge of each breast in order to close it.  I then rubbed some of the butter mixture onto each breast and then followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  I will be making this again and again.  Hubby is still raving about it!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic!! I followed other reviewers' advice, and added extra lemon. Also added spinach. I preferred less cream cheese and more cheddar, but I think it depends on individual taste - my husband preferred more cream cheese instead. Turned out great!! My husband can't wait to have it again.

This one is a keeper!  I used Monterey Jack cheese instead because it's my favorite.  I only had thin chicken breasts so I put one on top of the other...and I didn't have toothpicks...soooo.....I had quite a mess...but it was a yummy mess!  LOL!  Thanks...Loved it!

Wow! Amazing recipe. I did as other reviewers did and pounded the chicken and rolled it securing with toothpicks.  I also used shredded cheese instead of the slices, and parmesan instead of romano. The flavor was just wonderful. Thank you!

Very good recipe. I tried to flatten and roll up the chicken, which worked ok, but with some leakage of cheese. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and shredded cheddar, mixing them in a bowl and spreading them onto the chicken. I would probably add more lemon juice to the sauce next time.

One of our favorites and becoming a weekly staple at our house. Looks like it should be high-maintenance, but is totally easy. Can easily be reduced to feed one or two.

this recipe was good, but I felt rather guilty as I enjoyed it.  This was probably the richest savory dish I've ever had.  If I make it again, I'll reduce the amount of butter because as I pulled it out of the oven, it was literally swimming in butter.  The flavors were spot on though

This recipe turned out really well. I made a few personal changed to meet my needs. 1. I spread the cream cheese through the chicken. 2. I used shredded cheddar cheese rather than slices. 3. I dipped the chicken in lemon juice. 4. Sprinkled garlic and onion powder. 5. Dipped it in Italian bread crumbs. 6. Baked for 25 mins.  Turned out wonderful! :)

Perfection? Plopped this very easy to make recipe into the oven, ran an errand and returned to a delicous aroma and my roomate in utter awe after shoveling down two whole chicken breasts. It tasted like heaven, i used the exact measurements of everything. Easily the best chicken EVER

Excellent recipe.  I am a novice cook so I struggled with butterflying the breasts nicely.  Also because of other reviews I used very little cream cheese.  Next time I will use more.  Used parmesean instead of romano. The flavor of the chicken is really good and it came out pretty moist.

Very, very good!  We doubled the ingredients for the garlic and lemon juice and it came out perfectly.  Butterflied the chicken and stuck 2-3 toothpicks in each breast to keep the cheese from coming out.  What an amazing dish!

This recipe is soooo good!  I did as some readers suggested and cut the cream cheese in half, it was still enough but didn't overpower the dish.  I also pounded the chicken flat and rolled up, securing with toothpicks on either end.  As we are garlic and lemon lovers, we doubled these ingredients. As the sauce is very rich tasting, we used some of it to pour over fresh, steamed broccoli - delicious!

Yummy!! This was really good. I used less cream cheese as per previous reviewers comments, but I was kinda wishing I had used more! Next time I plan on leaving out the cheddar, I don't think it really added anything. I'm going to put garlic and green onions in with the cream cheese and use panko crumbs next time. I also plan on using less butter on top, maybe just a drizzle and a squeeze of lemon, as my crumbs were a bit soggy from all the butter. Thanks so much for a great recipe!!

This is a very easy recipe. I used goats cheese instead of cream cheese. I also used swiss cheese and fresh parmasean cheese. I butterflied them as suggested and thought the ratio was perfect! The next time I make this I will reduce the garlic salt and try using just powder and salt to my own disgression. Overall it was a good and easy recipe!

Substituted panko bread crumbs with added italian seasoning, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken did not brown very much, so it didn't look very appetizing but it tasted pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and very easy. I didn't even measure anything and it came out great. For a time saver try the already thin sliced chicken breasts- no pounding!

This tastes a lot like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse stuffed chicken!  I cut off any fat, then butterfly and flatten the chicken with a meat pounder.  Put the cream cheese in the microwave for 20 seconds or so just until it is spreadable and spread evenly on the chicken. Season the chicken with a little dried rosemary and garlic powder.  Then I sprinkle on shredded cheddar cheese, roll the chicken up and secure with 3 toothpicks before dipping in milk and breading (this keeps the cheese inside!).  I do use extra lemon juice - about 4 - 6 TBS.  Everyone loved this including my 11 year old brother, he requested this for Thanksgiving!  It is a little time consuming, but it is worth it!

I had my doubts while putting this together. I am glad I gave it a chance.  I used crushed corn flakes and fresh grated Parmesan for the breading. I also cooked the garlic in the butter but left about half of it in the saucepan when I drizzled the chicken -- I felt that was enough (and I love garlic).   This is definitely not guilt-free but it's still on the keeper list.

I'm someone who doesn't do very much cooking, nor am I very good at it.  However this recipe has proven to be something I totally fell in love with upon making it for the first time- I've made it a couple of times sense then.  It's simple, easy, and full of flavor!

It was almost unbelievable, but definitely worth trying it was good.  My BF would have liked an even crispier breading he said :) But definitely squeeze more lemon than the recipe calls for the taste is so good.

I've made this twice so far, revising a little the second time to my family's liking. Firstly, I only had frozen chicken breast tenderloins, but that actually turns out better for me because it's easier to make more portions and fit it in my baking dish. I pounded the thawed chicken flat, and rolled it. I spread the cream cheese (as well as using less of it, my brother isn't fond of cream cheese) and instead of using Cheddar, I used ColbyJack cheese. Everything else I kept the same. This recipe is wonderful. The garlic, cheeses, and lemon blend together in the mouth beautifully. It's certainly a palate pleaser! I usually serve it with mashed potatoes and steamed brocolli.

I followed this recipe as written, but reduced to 2 servings and probably used less cheese than called for.  I find it easier to hold "stuffing" in chicken when the breast is pounded and then rolled, so that's what I did, but it shouldn't matter in the end.  This chicken was delicious!  I served it with simple sauteed summer squash for a fantastic 30 minute meal.  Thank you!

This chicken is SO SO good. My husband and I both love it. Some other reviewers have said that the cream cheese was too overpowering but I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was perfect. I use toothpicks to secure it to help keep the cheese in. I also like to cover chicken with foil for half of the baking time. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly and serve it with white rice and broccoli or another veggie.

This chicken is wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half, so I used 4 chicken breasts, which I pounded thin and folded over the filling.  For the filling I mixed about 3 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tsp. minced garlic and 1 sliced green onion.  It was superb!  I highly recommend this recipe!

HOLY COW! THIS IS GOOD! I wish this dish were not so bad for you or I would make it every week! My husband, 2 year old and I LOVED it. I have been telling all my cream cheese loving friends about it too. Very good and very easy to make, I loved the sauce the lemon flavor was such a nice touch with the cheeses....mmmmmm. We will eventually make this again, maybe when I am having a skinny day lol

Everyone was skeptical when I told them what was on the menu...but one hour later, everyone was smiling and full! This dish was wonderful. We followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and pounded out the chicken thin, placed the cheeses inside, and then rolled them up, securing them with a few toothpicks. The dish turned out delicious and was a new way to eat chicken.

One of my favs!!!! You certainly don't need as much cheese as it calls for -- and I am a cheese lover! I have made this several times but will try the shredded/spradable suggestions next time. Super easy and yummy!!!!

Other than doctoring-up the cream cheese with herbs, I made this as written.  Very tasty!  I can't wait to play around with various stuffing ingredients.  I made multi colored bow-tie pasta alfredo with lots of mushrooms, spinach and garlic and they went very well together.

This chicken was really good.  I should have listened to others and cut back on the cream cheese, because it was a bit overwhelming.  But all in all, it was great!  We had it for leftovers 2 other nights, along with a pasta side.  I will definitely make this again, with the exception of changing the amount of cream cheese.

As far as taste in considered, this is one of the better chicken recipes i've came accross.  I did everything as instructed, except added 1 egg to the milk, just to help the breading stick good....My wife and son both said "WOW" when they had a bite, if there was leftovers there wouldn't be any now for sure :)

This was very delicious. I softened my cream cheese and mixed in some grated cheddar before stuffing the chicken with it instead of using slices of each. I also increased the amount of garlic powder and lemon because I wanted the sauce to be stronger. I do think the amount of butter was excessive and next time I will cut that in half to save some calories. I also found that I needed to bake this for 40 minutes instead of 30 to make sure it was done all the way through. Will definitely be making again.

Very good. VERY rich though. And I don't really feel like it's much of "garlic sauce," it's really more of a garlic butter, which subsequently burned in the oven. It didn't affect the taste though, overall very good.

yummm...this was great! I used Colby shredded cheddar and rolled them secured with toothpicks. I also cut the cream cheese in half as other reviewers suggested. I'm glad I did because the cream cheese can easily become overpowering. Quick, easy and delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This is a "wow" recipe. As others mention, it is extremely rich. If you are making this for a supper with your family, I suggest cutting back on the cream cheese. If you are having a dinner party, however, and want to impress your guests, pull out all the stops and use the listed ingredients. This will definitely be a hit!

This was awesome! I cut the cream cheese like others had recommended and next time would cut back on the lemon a little too because it over powered the cheese and garlic flavors. Will definitely be making this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I halved the recipe, and then still went lighter on the cheeses and butter - to make the recipe a little more healthy .  I also found that I had a lot of bread crumbs leftover (thrown away), so next time I'll go light on that, too.   Will definitely put this one into the rotation for a treat!

Thank you. I made this about a week ago and nothing went to waste. I beat the chicken like alot of other readers and found the chicken to be quite tender and flavorful. The only thing I missed was the mozzerella cheese and had to substitute what I had. This was delish, will make it again for my kids. Thank you.

My finished product turned out really, really greasy and soggy.  There was too much melted butter at the bottome of the baking dish after cooking, that my chicken was really soggy.  The breading peeeled off with a slime-like consistency.  I had to actually broil it the last 10 minutes to crisp up the top of the chicken.  I will try this recipe again because the flavor was delicious.  I guess less butter is what I would need to do.

I thought this chicken was out of this world!  I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I substituted orange juice and you could not tell it.  My hubby loved it and thought it was definitely worth repeating.

really good. I didn't have the seasoned bread crumbs but I just took a rolling pin to a bag of chicken flavored stuffing until it was finely crushed. Worked great. I also just used parmesan cheese.

Mixed feelings on this recipe.  The chicken was very tender, but I would definitely cut back on the cream cheese as others have recommended.  Cooking time needs to be at least 40 minutes otherwise the chicken is still a bit pink inside.  The breadcrumb batter was delicious and perfect for any type of filling.

This recipe was really yummy.  I used whipped cream cheese on the inside and pepper jack cheese to add a zing.  Needs more lemon juice and less butter, and I need to learn to secure the ends better, but an all-star dish!

AWESOME!!  I did use some of the other suggestions to use less Cream Cheese, Parmesan instead of Romano and sliced the chicken to be able to roll instead of just sandwich. Also used a little more Lemon juice. it was VERY Tasty.  will be adding to my own recipe box to do often.

This is an awesome recipe!  I used about a tablespoon of butter per chicken breast to pour over the top and that was enough.  Fantastic, I'll make this over and over.

One of the best chicken dishes I've had in a long time!~  Eveyone in the family loved it!  Made it for my husbands birthday tonight.  He kept saying I did good! I had trouble trying to butterfly them, so I flattened them and then rolled mine up with about 1 TBl. chive flavored cream cheese spread on top of the cheddar; used herb and garlic flavored breadcrumbs.  I didn't have toothpicks, but was careful and they stayed together during baking with some leakage of the cheese.  The chicken came out very moist!  I will most definately keep this recipe on hand.

Very good, rich creamy and delish! I served it with parmesan garlic angel hair pasta. I didn't know whether my family would like this or not, but it was good.

This flew past my previous favorite recipe to land squarely in first. I LOVED this recipe, in the past week and a half I have made it twice (I live alone so I've had leftovers) and am having some friends over later this week to make it for them. Absolutely great!

This was a very good recipe, I have five children, three of which are teenagers, and a full time job. This was really easy but of course I had to make it my own. I used cheap stuffing mix for the bread crumbs, alittle different seasonings, and I baked it on a rack to keep it up out of the juices/ grease. (not that there is alot of grease) but this way it was crispy on the bottom as well. Thank you very much, this will become a mainstay.

This is a truly delicious recipe.  Great if you're on a low carb diet.  I just substituted grated parmesan cheese for the bread crumbs and it tasted fabulous.  It certainly isn't a recipe that fits with a low fat diet though!

Delicious!!  I'm not a very experienced cook, but this was really simple, and tasted great!  I served mine over noodles in a lemon butter sauce.  It was definitely restaurant quality.  My husband loved it!

I changed this around based upon what I had at home and was very pleased. I used laughing cow cheese wedges instead of cream cheese, pounded the breasts flat and added fresh spinach, sun dried tomatoes and fresh minced garlic on he inside. I dipped these in the milk and lemon, rolled in crumbs and baked. Very tasty. I didn't baste this with butter but sprayed with olive oil spray.

I used a small slice of Cream Cheese, less than listed on the recipe and Shredded Chedder Cheese. I rolled the cheese inside the chicken. I baked in Olive oil.  The receipe was excellent and would suggest for any meal including entertaining. I served with aspargas and Olive Oil noodles, what a hit.

I actually made this recipe on two separate occasions!! First, tested it with my family and they loved it. Followed the recipe exactly minus the paprika.  Second, cooked it for my boyfriend and a few of his teammates but decided to cut the cream cheese in half. They were very pleased! I decided to serve it with a creamy corn casserole... FATTENING?? BUT WELL WORTH IT!!

This recipe was good, but i made some modifications due to lack of ingredients i had at home. I pounded the chicken to about 1/4" thick and spread a layer of cream cheese. Then put a small piece of american cheese on one ened.  Then sprinkled a light layer of lemon herb seasoning and garlic powder. I rolled up the chicken and secured with a toothpick. Then i coated each breast in a beaten egg. I realized i was out of breadcrumbs, so i crushed up about 1c of french fried onions and rolled the chicken until coated. The bake time and temperature recommended was perfect. WONDERFUL dish!  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious, if very rich - but that was to be expected. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'll whisk an egg in with the milk to make the breadcrumbs stick better, and probably cut back a little on the cream cheese. I'll also add a lot more lemon - I doubled it this time and still felt it could do with a lot more.

OMG OMG OMG!!! that is all I could say, bite after bite after bite!! For starters, I sprayed the baking dish with olive oil flavored Pam. I pounded the chicken breasts and followed the recipe to a T with an exception of not using cheddar cheese.  I had some smoked gouda cheese on hand so I used the cream cheese, sliced 1/4 inch and added a 1/2 inch slice of smoke gouda. YUM!!  what makes it is the butter, lemon, garlic sauce.  I took the first bite (without the cheese) and I was in heaven!!! This recipe is an absolute MUST!  Fattening, yes, delicious, yes!  This is a recipe when you definitely want to indulge, thanks for the awesome dish!

This chicken is great. You can modify the filling to suit your own tastes and mood of the day. I used about half of the cream cheese that was called for and found that to be perfect. I added 1/2 Tbls of minced garlic to 1 cup melted butter and 8tsp lemon juice to make the lemon butter mixture for 6 chicken breasts. After the cheddar cheese and cream cheese were placed on the chicken, I sprinkled the inside of the chicken with paprika, garlic salt and drizzled with a bit of the lemon butter mixture.I dipped the chicken in the lemon butter before breading (omitted the milk).  I did have to raise the oven temperature to 375 and bake for 45 minutes. This is a definite keeper, CHRCAMILLO! Thank you for posting the recipe.

This recipe was great! I made the following modifications: used Alouette low fat garlic and herb cheese, and mixed in about 1 T fresh basil and oregano. Didn't use the Cheddar. Also when making the sauce, I used mostly olive oil with 1 T of butter for flavor. I did this to reduce the fat content. Will definitely have again!

This recipe was sooo good.  Easy to make and very delicious, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, a sprinkle of praprika and fresh ground garlic.  My husband loved it and the leftovers were better the next day.  I made a few with cheddar and cream cheese and I made the other half with a little bit of cream cheese, parmesan, mozzarella and provolone, they were both amazing.  I recommend this dish to everyone.

Very nice. I put the garlic inside the chicken with the cheese instead of in the lemon butter. I also added some Italian Herbs to the cheese as I used plain breadcrumbs. Next time I would use a bit more lemon juice or even add a little zest to the butter.

In my opinion, the chicken tasted fine, but the lemon butter sauce needs a little something.  The butter flavor was prominent while you could just barely taste the lemon.  Thank you.

This was good but very rich...almost too rich. I think the cream cheese was a bit much for me (and I am a cheese lover). I ended up squeezing out at least half of the mixture on purpose. The breading on the chicken w/ the lemon and garlic butter was aweswome. I think the chicken stuffed with a feta/garlic mixture would be better. I will use the breading in the future for sure.

If you like your food REALLY rich, then make as the recipe states. Otherwise, you might want to omit one or the other of the cheeses, or at least cut back on the cream cheese and I would only use Extra Sharp cheddar for this. The rest of the recipe was AWESOME once you got over the richness of the stuffing. Even my partner who I have to hide cheese from so I know its there for recipes, thought that the chesse was a little overwhelming.

Good, but way too rich. I should have cut back on the cream cheese as suggested. My family did not comment on this dish, but they ate it so I guess that is good.

We love this recipe!  It is sinfully delicious!  I'm not really interested in a "sauce" over the chicken (we like it crunchier) so I decrease the amount of butter to about 1/2 cup but keep the other sauce ingredients the same. Also I usually make this for company and make about 12 breasts but use the same amount of cheese, just smaller slices and it still turns out very rich.  I have made this a couple of days ahead and stored in the freezer or fridge before cooking.  Just brought it to room temp. before cooking as usual.  Don't forget to sprinkle garlic salt and paprika over it to add some flavor and color!

This is by far my favorite recipe.  I make it at least once every two weeks.  I cut the chicken breasts in half and them out between two sheets of wax paper to make them flatter and more tender.  This also makes it easier to roll the cheese inside.  I cut the amount of cream cheese in half and that seems to work well.  Delicious!!!

I loved this but my husband did not. He's not a huge fan of cream cheese and it overpowered the recipe a little too much. i added a little white wine to the melted butter and garlic.

Very good.  We used low-fat cream cheese which worked/tasted just fine.  We also halved the recipe, and it came out great.

My husband and I LOVE this chicken, we have made this recipe about 7-8 times already. I have like the others cut back a little on the cream cheese but did add a little extra cheddar. I have served it both with mashed potatoes and rice.  TASTY!!

This was amazing!!!  The flavors were fantastic, and it's very versatile.  I couldn't get enough of it.  My husband said there was too much cream cheese, so I would probably decrease that a little next time.  I shared the recipe with my sister who made it for her husband and in-laws and they all loved it.  She said they had a silent meal for a while - everyone was too busy eating to talk!  It has a gourmet kind of taste without a lot of fancy work.  My sister used scissors to cut the breasts in half and said that it worked very well.  Absolutely a new favorite!

Sorry, definately not a recipe I will be making again.  We had mixed reviews here.  I love garlic lemon chicken, and my husband and kids love anything with cheese so I thought this would be perfect for us.  The flavor combination didnt really do anything for me.  Wasnt very lemony, and the cream cheese predominated.  Mostly this tasted like breaded baked chicken with cream cheese.  Kind of bland.  It was easy to make however.

I was skeptical about using cream cheese, but this turned out really well. I used low-fat cheddar cheese, cream cheese, romano cheese, and skim milk to push it a bit more to the healthy side.

Served at a luncheon and it was a phenomenal hit!  I added finely chopped broccoli to onion and chive cream cheese. I softened this mixture in the microwave. I also drizzed just a bit of butter before baking and it was very moist(to cut down on calories).  I used no fat or low fat cheeses also.

This was such a fancy but simple recipe.  I only made three pieces of chicken for us.  I made slight changes - since I am on Weight Watchers, I used fat free cream cheese and Kraft 2% Sharp Cheddar for the filling and mixed the bread crumbs with Kraft Lite Parmesan cheese.  Also, I sliced very thin slices of the cheddar and use a teaspoon to place small pieces of the cream cheese - I wanted them to melt evenly.  We LOVED this.  I had to bake it for 50 minutes though - maybe my chicken pieces were too big?  Regardless, this is a HUGE hit with us and it will stay in my file.  This will be what I make the next time I have company.

These are AMAZING. The sauce also serves as a wonderful dipping sauce for bread. When I made them a 2nd time I did use a little less cream cheese cut into small pieces that I place throughout the inside of the chicken breast to make it melt a little more evenly.

I thought this was above average, but my husband said it was one of the best chicken recipes ever.  I prefer dark meat because white meat is usually too dry, but the cheeses made the chicken very moist, so I would make this recipe again.  I loved the taste of the garlic lemon butter and may make some of that just to put on other foods!

SO Good!  I used low fat cream cheese.  I found it probably would've been too difficult to slice the chicken so thinly so I pounded it a bit thinner and rolled the ingredients in the chicken breast halves.  I secured each one with a toothpick before baking.  Next time I will use shredded cheddar to make that rolling a bit easier.  I also baked them for quite a bit longer (at least 10-15 minutes more) than the recipe called for.  They still came out very juicy.  
I think I will use a little less cream cheese on each one as well.  I didn't find I needed as much of the milk and bread crumbs either.  This was a messy one to prepare but well worth it.  My picky boyfriend loved it.  When he says, "Care, you done good." and goes back for seconds... what more compliment do you need?

Wonderful recipe! A change I made was to use a cream cheese that had onions and chives in it. It added a bit of extra flavor. Also, I used plain, toasted bread crumbs & parmesan cheese the first time I made it. Turned out wonderfully. I made it today with the same plain toasted bread crumbs but used the called-for romano cheese and it turned out just as tasty. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband is not a big fan of chicken dishes, but he really liked this. Said it was "restaurant quality". He also felt it was the garlic that made it. I used very little lemon juice - just a couple of squeezes.
This chicken is also tasty cold!

DH and I both REALLY enjoyed this.  It was flavorful, cheesy and yummy.  Watch the cooking time - mine wasn't done after 30 min. @ 365 degrees, never mind 350, which might depend on the size of the breasts.  This will be part of our "regular" meal selection!

Delicious! I couldn't be bothered with the butterflying - instead I pounded the breasts flat, put the filling on, rolled them up, and used toothpicks to hold them together. A little of the cheese oozed out, but not much. Next time I think I will use garlic and herb cream cheese. Definitely make double the amount of garlic butter sauce - the noodles really soak it up. Superb, recipe. Thanks!

The "lemon sauce" is far too "lemony" to go with the cheese.  If you like lemon, cut way back on the juice.  Suggest white wine--anything but lemon which does not compliment the cheese at all.  The method of cooking is good as is the stuffing and breading.  Only the sauce is lacking.  Even cream of mushroom soup would be preferable to this way too tangy lemon flavor!

I had to improvise with this....I didn't have cream cheese or cheddar, so I stuffed the chicken with a mix of feta/oregano/lemon juice.  It was very good, had a nice light lemon flavor.  Served with rice and fresh green beans.  It made a wonderful meal.

I thought this tasted much better the next day.  I guess I wasn't fond of the way cream cheese baked up in the chicken breast, nor was my family.  I did butterfly my breasts and had no problem with the cheese leaking out.

What a tasty recipe!  I was a bit apprehensive about how many different flavors there were - but this is fantastic!  We used a super-sharp cheddar and found it great.

This was good, but had too much cheese.  I liked the lemon, garlic flavor, but just too cheesy for our liking.

I am glad to have found this recipe, it was great!  I made just two half breasts with this recipe, adjusting ingredients accordingly.  I used garlic pam-type spray instead of oil.  I only used about 1 1/2 - 2 tsp cream cheese per breast half, it was plenty rich enough in flavor.  I also added a little pepper, some SpiceHunter Garlic Pepper Blend, and just a little seasoning salt to the inside of the chicken.  I cut down on the butter and increased the garlic to drizzle on the top.  I appreciate the tip from another reader about the French Fried onions, I'll try that next time.  Our opinion is:  More garlic - more lemon juice.  Maybe try Meyer lemon juice for a little different flavor some time.  GREAT recipe, we THANK you!

Very easy to make with little preparation; chicken is easy to butterfly if slightly frozen. I usually have all the ingredients necessary in my kitchen.  Great for company, or to take to a neighbor.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made this for a romantic dinner w/ my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it.  It was actually very good with red wine (I broke the wine/meat rule here, but it actually worked very well).

Very flavorful, just the right amount of everything.  For a little texture, next time I might consider adding a few crispy onion things on top (like what you put on top of green beans).

YUMMY!!!! This was a wonderful combination of different tastes that came together to complement one another! I must confess that we did not enjoy the garlic salt and felt that it competed with the rest of the dish; I won't use that again. I will use only half of the cream cheese next time, and I may use shredded cheddar cheese for ease of placement within the butterflied chicken breast. Everyone has their own techniques! We halved the recipe but did not halve the garlic lemon butter sauce; I think I will double that next time; we just loved it! I used the asiago-romano-parmesan cheese from Kraft and this was delicious with the italian bread crumbs. Please give this recipe a try; it is just delicious and a nice change to chicken. You can use reduced fat cheese and fat free cream cheese to improve the healthiness of this dish. Enjoy! Mmmm, my mouth is watering just thinking about this chicken!

This is a GOOD chicken recipe.  It took a little longer than the 30 minutes (more like 45) to cook, but worth the wait.  I added some mixed herbs to the bread crumbs.  We think it would be good served over steamed spinach, for a low carb option-- instead of rice.

Eh. The cream cheese didn’t really melt. We felt like the Romano was a little too powerful and overshadowed the lemon. I wish it had more lemon flavor. It’s just ok.

Delicious! The cheese helps keep the chicken juicy. No need to roll this up, just stuff it and roast it! Broccoli went great as the side.

Loved this recipe! I made a few small modifications and they are;  Mixed Panko 50/50 with the Italian bread crumbs; Used a Cracker Barrell sharp cheddar cheese stick in each breast along with the cream cheese; Added chopped chives inside each breast. 

My husband loved this recipe and he's not a real foodie like me. It was easy and so yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be making it again.

Absolutely amazing! I’ve made this many times as written! The flavor of the cream cheese / velvetta garlic lemon are delicious!! I hate when people review recipes they change things in, then it’s different! I made this as written many times, amazing as is! BUT ive made one change as a personal preference, I’ve found to have more moist chicken I dip in mayo instead of milk prior to dipping in Bread crumbs. Up to you either way, I’m sure milk is the healthiest option but either way I highly recommend!!!!

I made this last night and it turned out very tasty. For some reason the milk did not act as a good binder for the bread crumbs. Not a problem, though. After I drizzled the butter mixture, I added more bread crumbs on top of the chicken. I might use an egg or half and half next time. Another difference I used was whipped cream cheese (I figured spreading it would do better). I added just enough garlic salt to the cream cheese to give it some flavor. By using the whipped cream cheese, my blocks of cheddar stayed inside the chicken better. Leftovers were even better the next night! This is a wonderful recipe.

This was very tasty.  We both liked it a lot and will make it again.  I took 2 very thin chicken breasts and put the cheese mixture in the middle and rolled them up.  I did not use the milk.  I dipped the rolled up chicken in the butter, garlic, lemon mixture and then in the bread crumbs.  I used Parmesan cheese with Italian panko and regular Italian breadcrumbs.  I goofed with the garlic salt.  I added that to the butter and lemon mixture... so I just added the minced garlic to that same mixture too.

I made this according to the original recipe. Everyone loved it. For the next time I make it, I am considering making a pocket instead of  butterflying the breasts. This will help to hold the runny cheeses inside.

This was an excellent new dish that I made for guests over the weekend, and it just became my wife's new favorite dish. In fact, she's  enjoying the leftovers now.

A few tweaks I recommend:
- You can use about 1/2 the amount of milk.
- You'll have a lot of breadcrumbs left over. Just throw them into the chicken folds. They add to the stuffing.
- I expected the cream cheese to melt and blend in with the cheddar, but it didn't. Next time my cream cheese slices will be 1/4" or less.

Delicious! Easy to put together and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking. I used shredded cheddar as several reviews had mentioned.

This wasn't bad. It's like breaded chicken breasts with a twist. I used half a chicken breast and omitted the minced garlic.  It came out pretty good, though my melted cheeses ended up on the plate. I would make it again someday.

Made exactly according to recipe. Loved it, though my hubby said it was too rich. He liked it but just couldn't eat all of it. I had no trouble eating all mine. :-)

I substituted Planko crumbs, made my own Italian spice mix, used parmesan cheese and inside used a 3 year white cheddar and garlic/dill cream cheese (the only stuff I had on hand). Oh, and I zessed it up with some extra lemon/herb seasoning on top. My wife was amazed and we are planning to have it again soon. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!!

Sorry, no photos. It was such a surprise we focused on eating!

Loved it, loved it,.  I used panko instead of Italian bread crumbs.  I use panko frequently and couldn't remember the bread crumbs in the recipe when I got to the store without a list.  Next time I'll add a touch more lemon.  Chicken breasts come in such a variety of sizes.  Going forward I'll opt to use a package of 3 breasts as  opposed to a family pack with maybe 6 or more.  In the 3 pack the sizes are more consistent.  The family pack had small,l medium and large.  Harder to stuff and then cook.  This is in my keeper file.

It was very good. I used other reviewers suggestions. Pounded chicken. Used a cream cheese cheddar spread. I made 6 and Rolled them. The only change I would  make is to add more 3 T lemon or to taste to the half of cup of butter. 30 min at 350 maybe take smaller breast’s out at 20 min.

My whole family loved this, including my picky child. My husband said it was amazing and something I will have to make again. I did change two things. One instead of cutting the chicken I pounded it to about 1/2 inch thick and rolled it around the cheese, and I used 2/3 cup of milk with an egg beat into it rather than just milk to give better adhesion for the bread crumbs.

Even my very picky six year old loved it, and I can't think of higher praise. I baked it in my cast iron skillet  with a touch of bacon grease instead of oil and it came out beautifully that way too.

This was good. It was a little messy so toothpicks or something to keep the chicken together after stuffing it is recommended.  The leftovers were also great when warmed.

This was very good. As there is only 2 of us, I used 2 chicken breasts and reduced the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  I only had soft cream cheese so just spread a bit on the chicken with a spatula so probably didn't use as much as was called for in the recipe. Same with the cheddar cheese.  My husband and I just ate half of a breast each and served it with a pasta dish made with fresh vegetables...grape tomatoes and zucchini. It wasn't too rich or heavy this way. Also made for great leftovers!

This was a very yummy meal however the cheeses both oozed outside of the chicken. I will pound flat next time and use toothpicks to secure and see if that helps. Thanks!

Very tasty. Added Prosciutto and served with a lemon, olive oil dressed arugula salad with parmesan shavings. It was delish! Made enough to freeze so I'm anxious to see how they turn out when rewarmed. Will definitely make again. Thank you.

This recipe is simple and great.  I've made it twice now and the second time perfected it by cutting back to about half the cream cheese ( I was low on reg cream cheese so I mixed some veggie flavor cream cheese with and it was fabulous) Everyone in my house loved it!

I made this last  week and it was absolutely delicious!!! I served it over angel hair. The only thing that would make it better and I will do next time is make more of the sauce. We wanted something more for on top of the pasta. We will definitely make it again. My family is very partial to lemon.

Holy moly this is good! I just spread a thin layer of softened cream cheese inside each breast and topped with the cheddar slices, it was much easier. I served with rice-a-roni and a veggie. Thumbs up from hubby and 3 teenagers!

I have made this twice already, both times went over very well!  Once with Italian Panko and the other Italian bread crumbs. I think the panko bakes up better looking. I cut the cheese  in half and used cold cream cheese ( my thinking that it would be insulated inside the chicken and may not ooze out so much) and extra sharp cheddar because I had it. Also only had parm for the breading vs Romano.  To the melted butter, I added extra garlic ( always do ) and more lemon because its yummy! All my carnivores loved it! Thank you

We liked this enough (but it won't be requested again).  I reduced the cheese by half and it was still a bit much.  The lemon, butter garlic mixture atop the breadcrumb coating it's just delicious. I mixed the cream cheese with a clove of fresh minced garlic and it was tasty. Also, I used thin breasts and it wasn't quite done at 30 minutes. So the cook time was off by about 15 minutes.

This was amazing!! Ingredient wise, no need to change a thing. The flavors are perfect.  I DID pound the chicken breast instead of butterflying it (just easier to handle).  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds and then spread it on, then added the cheddar ( I shredded REAL cheddar-not the bagged stuff). WOW! is all I can say.  Good job CHARCAMILLO!!!

I loved this recipe! I will say that I doubled the lemon in the sauce and it was delicious - I will probably put even more in the sauce next time because I really want that lemon flavor to stand out. Overall, this recipe was delicious, moist, and relatively easy!

Made this for the first time a couple of years ago.  Let my 20 something year old daughter taste it and she asked for it for her birthday dinner 2 nights later.  I was happy to make/eat it again!  One of my very favorite chicken breast recipes!

When I first made this it was missing that little crunch and the cheese mixture was missing something.  substituted breadcrumbs with panko and some Italian seasoning.  Added roasted diced green chilies in a can to the cheese.  Mixed the cream cheese, cheddar and chilies.  I also found you don't need as much milk.  Only needed half the milk.  And Bam!!  For my taste it took it up a notch.  :)

I HIGHLY recommend this dish.  It's amazing!

Delicious! Was in the mood for something with lemon butter. Only differences was I flattened the chicken cutlets and spread thin layer of cream cheese, sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese and rolled tucked down.  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I kept to minimal cream cheese but probably still could have been just slightly less (was still good and not too overwhelming). Will definitely make this again.

It was OK.  A lot of work and calories for a mediocre dish.  Not enough flavor.  I did one substitution because that is what I had on hand and that was parm instead of romano cheese.  Maybe just personal preference.

Made this about 5 times now and my kids say it's their new fave.  They ask me to make it every week.  If you follow the recipe exactly it's amazing but you can make small tweaks to your taste and it's still amazing.  We like lemon so I use one extra table spoon of lemon and I use whatever breadcrumbs I have in my pantry - Italian, garlic, it all tastes great.  I grate my cheddar cheese and always use green onion cream cheese (adds the best flavor).  I mix the grated cheddar and cream cheese together and put spoonfuls into the butterflied breasts.  Yes, the cheese melts out in the pan a bit but my family says this is the best part and spoons it over rice.  Really solid awesome recipe that is now one of my standard rotations.

Absolutely delicious! I had to make a couple of adjustments based on what ingredients I had on hand—shredded cheddar cheese instead of a block, and parmesan instead of romano. I think doing it with the suggested block of cheddar would have made it better, so kudos to the recipe there! The chicken did need significantly more time to cook than the suggested 30 minutes—I tried 40 minutes, as many other reviewers suggested, and it had just finished cooking at that point. I definitely recommend using the optional paprika—I think that's what kicked it up from a good bite to a great bite!

Added a slice of deli ham.  Used chive and onion soft cream cheese with the slice of cheese.  Had some trouble handling the breading part but managed it.  My son loved it hot out of the oven.  Husband and I took it for lunch and I didn't think it was that great re-heated.  Overall very good!

Easy, Peezy, Lemon Squeezy!  And absolutely delightful, taste wise.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, since they seem to have more flavor than breasts.  I took another reviewers suggestion and cooked it for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  Added less cream cheese and more lemon.  Also added a few sprigs of fresh rosemary, and roasted two garlic bulbs in with the chicken so we could have it with garlic bread (good for sopping up the delicious sauce too).  Served with a tomato cucumber salad.  Will be making this again for certain.  Boyfriend loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight and it was fabulous! Best thing I've made in a while. Used spreadable onion and chive cream cheese and just a squeeze of lemon juice since my husband is not a lemon fan. Chicken was juicy and the cheese in the middle put it over the top. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made this a few times for different groups of people, and it was a hit every time! The only change I made was cut the amount of cream cheese, as was suggested by others. Otherwise, a fancy-looking dish that takes very little effort!

This was very good... But I must agree with Loislain, it was very heavy and me nor my family to eat an entire piece of the chicken. I think it had too much cheese. If I make this again, I will decrease the amount of cheese used, use 1/4 the amount called for.

My kids said I could beat Bobby Flay with this dish! :) I did although season the chicken before I added it to the milk and bread crumbs.

Me and my husband love...love..loved it...he told me to add this to my list of dinners. Very easy to make and i added bacon bits and 1/2 the amount of cream cheese after reading the reviews...next time I'll use the actual suggested amount to see if its as reach as some ppl say.

This was fabulous!! I did what others suggested and flattened the breasts & rolled them up with toothpicks. I made 2 breasts-used 2 oz of cheese & cream cheese for each; that was more than enough. I also used mozzarella cheese. I didn't have any garlic, so I just melted butter & added garlic powder and lemon juice, then drizzled it over the chicken. I will make this again!

Very tasty and my husband enjoyed it.  H's usually quite picky.  I will cut back the amount of cream cheese, add another meat product and more lemon next time.

My daughter loved this and wants it for her recipe book.  I added herbes de provence to the breading mixture to give the chicken some flavor other than the cheese.  I did not use the butter but did squeeze lemons over the chicken.  I also cooked this at 400 degrees.

This is my son's favorite meal!  It's hard to mess this recipe up...in fact I use shredded cheese and mix it with the cream cheese before stuffing the chicken breast and they're still amazing!

I didn't change much, I used Boursin shallots and chives rather than cream cheese and a slice of velveeta. I also added chopped roasted pecans inside. Excellent!

This was so delicious!  I forwent the garlic salt and used fresh, minced garlic instead.  I used a mixture of Parmesan and Romano cheeses mixed with the breadcrumbs and served with garlic and butter sauteed squash and zucchini and Parmesan couscous.  It was AMAZING!

We really enjoyed this dish. The chicken was nice and moist  with a little extra zing from the cheese and lemon juice. The only down side is the calories.

So it's kind of funny, i defrosted pork chops and was looking for a good recipe, I came across this one and decided I could make it with pork. It came out wonderfully!!! Both my son and husband loved it, and request that I definitely make it again. I tend to tweek recipes according to what my family enjoys and what I think will taste good. So for the milk I added some Italian dressing, and instead of sprinkling the paprika and Garlic salt on top I added it to the milk as well. I also only used 1/4 of the butter instead of 3/4, it just seemed like a ton of butter to me. Lastly, I didn't have any cheddar so I used mozzarella. Delicious!!!!

Made it for dinner tonight (just 3 chicken breasts), and I didn't have cheddar.  I substituted a white, salted cheese and didn't use as much cream cheese as suggest by other reviews.  Tasted fine - the best part of the dish is the lemon-garlic-butter drizzled on top of the breading!   (I also didn't have lemon juice, so I used 5 drops of lemon essential oil.) 

We will definitely be making this one of our staple meals.

Based on other reviews, I halved the cream cheese and shredded the cheddar. Also topped the chicken with the butter/garlic/lemon sauce. Delicious!

My family and I are not fans of cream cheese so I cut the amt in half. I added bacon to the stuffing and served the dish over linguini that I mixed with the extra sauce I made since I doubled the recipe. I also added egg to the milk that the chicken was dipped in and used Parmesan instead of Romano. I woulda liked the chicken a bit more crispy but other than that Delicious!! Great recipe!! Thanks!!

I would recommend using 1/2 of the cheese per piece of chicken, and 1/2 or 1/3 of butter called for in the recipe.  I only made 3 breasts in a 8x8 dish and it was a little rich.  The meal tasted wonderful.  Recommend using toothpicks to keep cheese in as well.  The paprika sprinkled on top of the chicken added a nice flavor to the dish.

Very rich, so I substituted Neufchâtel Cheese (reduced fat cream cheese) and reduced the amount of cheddar cheese in the recipe. Still delicious but not quite a rich/heavy.

This was delicious.  Don't need a whole cup of milk - to state the obvious.  Used parm/romano mix cause that is what I had.  Excellent flavor.  Was apprehensive about this one, but it was delicious.

Delicious!!  I added some garlic powder along with the minced garlic for some extra garlicky flavor.  Next time I'll increase the lemon juice because it didn't have a noticeably lemony flavor.

This was fantastic! I followed the suggestion of softening the cream cheese and then mixing in shredded cheddar cheese, this made it easy to spread evenly inside the chicken. I also made extra sauce (and used extra garlic and lemon juice) so there'd be plenty to spoon on top of the chicken when it was served. It came out really moist! I also used fresh squeezed lemon juice as I think it adds more flavor.

I made this for 8 people and everyone loved it.  I rolled some & stuffed some depending on thickness of chicken.  Stuffing was easier and worked better than rolling the chicken.

We really liked this. I made a few minor changes to make it easier for me. I pounded the chicken breasts flat. I used shredded cheese instead of block and mixed the cream cheese and cheddar together before putting it in the chicken. I used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Also, used half of the crumb mixture.

It's a good recipe! Definitely a keeper! The only thing different I might do next time is to season the chicken a little better as I don't care for plain tasting chicken... I probably also will pound the chicken to make it even and you can try different bread crumbs, such as panko or even crackers. Thanks!

It managed to create a really moist chicken breast, but there are better ways of accomplishing this and I found it to be rather heavy. I don't think I will make it again.

This was great! I skipped the lemon garlic butter sauce this time because my two year old is only fond of lemon by itself (my little weirdo). I also added some chives to the cheese stuffing and it brought out some good flavor. This will most likely be a regular in our house now! I'd like to try the butter sauce next time!

My husband loved this and we will make it again for our family! Served with California Blend vegetables so the cheese that oozed out could be used as dip, although we reduced the stuffed cheese a bit. Yummy!

Made this last night and it was fantastic. It's so rich and delicious! I made a double batch and froze the extra for another night. Hubby and I just loved it. This will be my go-to recipe for a treat for guests.

I really enjoyed this dish and plan on making it again! It took very little time to actually prepare and was a really simple recipe! 

When I make it again, I think I am going to use a little less cream cheese (like others have mentioned), and add bacon to the center.

Because I didn't exactly follow the recipe I almost didn't review it, but then I thought that I wasn't the only one caught with my dilemma as I prepared this for two of us.  I was ready with the milk and do the breadcrumbs when I discovered that I was out of breadcrumbs.  What to do?!  So I mixed the butter sauce, put the cheeses inside the chicken breasts as called for by the submitter using toothpicks to hold them together, and put them in a small very heavy saucepan with the butter.  I covered the chicken breasts with parmesan.  I cooked them on stovetop with the lid for about 20 minutes on a very low setting and then without the lid for the final part until they were done according to my Thermapen.  They were delicious!  I would definitely do this again just exactly this way!  This was not only easy but very delicious!  Thank you so much, CHRCAMILLO!

This chicken was AMAZING!!!  My hubby has a "Happy Scale" and rates his food all the time, (don't ask).… Ive never heard him give anything a 5 before UNTIL now… with that first bite he yelled out, OH MY GOD!!  he said this was an absolute 5 out of 5. 

 I added more garlic and lemon juice that it called for.. probably double those 2 ingredients but followed the recipe the rest of the way… It was seriously one of the very best things Ive made in a long time… The kitchen smelled heavenly the whole time!  

 If I could give it more stars , I certainly would!!  I will be making this again…. and again!!!

This was really good.  I just had thin-cut chicken breasts so I put on the cheese and rolled it up and secured with a toothpick.  The cheese stayed in the roll and the chicken was moist and tasty.

This mouth watering recipe made my co-workers beg for more at our going away pot luck!! The exquisite flavor created by the use of the double cheese blended with the lemon garlic seasoning on the chicken is unforgettable. My family declared this dish a family tradition!! : )

Followed the recipe exactly, except added the garlic seasoning to the butter mixture. Didn't think it was too rich, & actually could have used more cheese in the middle of the chicken breast. Overall, very good & flavor was excellent!

Made this for my family and they loved it. The only difference, was that instead of just cheddar and cream cheese, I used cream cheese, cheddar, and cady creek cheese. It was extra melty and delicious.

This came out amazing and my husband absolutely loved it! I used panko bread crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs, and I also switched out the milk for the extra buttery garlic mixture. I will definitely be making this again.

LOVE THIS!! I am a sucker for anything with lemon and this is the PERFECT amount. I spread the cream cheese inside the chicken instead of just sticking a slice in there. I think it makes it easier to close back up, plus it keeps you from having a big chunk of cheese when you cut into it.

I made it for the first time for my boyfriends birthday dinner and it was a hit! I did as suggested by some and spread the cream cheese instead of using a chunk, used sharp cheddar and also pounded the chicken. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk which made the chicken even more tender! I used big chicken breast so the cooking time was an hour!
I will deff. make this again! Thanks for sharing this receipe!

Delicious!  I did not use the milk as others suggested and I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash Original seasoning. I also used a variety of cheeses of my choice.  The chicken was moist & the lemon was just enough.  The hubby rated it 5 stars & a high five :)

Wonderful!  Made as directed. Simply delicous. Will definatly make again. I made six in a pan and fed the four of us dinner and when I went back in the kitchen to clean up, the two remaining breast were still in the dish.  They looked beautiful and the cheese had solidified so I think if I make the recipe again I will be sure to let it sit out and rest before serving the next time.  They were a bit gooey, but I was probably in a hurry to eat...the chicken fills the house with a great sent.  Very good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was devestated with company coming in 1/2 hour to realize I had accidently bought boned chicken thighs. So- when life gives you lemons.....They were a hit!  My guests like dark meat, I don't, but they had a wonderful flavor.  Couldn't roll them so just spread cream cheese on one thgh, layed the cheddar on top and covered with the other thigh.  Sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan and poured butter mixture over the top.  They took a bit longer to cook, but were moist and delicious! Served with roasted red potatos and a spring mix salad with red onion and a garlic-lemon vinagarette.

I have tried many recipes from this site and have been pretty satisfied with all of them. This is my first review and my wife and I really enjoyed this one. My 2 year old daughter, not so much (probably the lemon taste), but I'm hoping she gets used to it. We will be having this again. The chicken stayed so moist and the recipe was perfect. Mmmmm.

OMG! This was delicious!  I had no left overs at our house.  The only things I changed was I used Pemko Italian bread crumbs with egg and no milk.  I also added bacon.  I did not have to use any tooth pics and all the goodies inside stayed in there until you cut into the chicken to eat it!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Definitly will be making this again! :)

Both my husband and 10 year old loved it!

Only changes I made were a little less cream cheese and a little less butter, based on other reviews.  Oh, and I also used shredded cheese - Triple Cheddar.  Next time, I'll cook it a little longer or cook it at 375.  It was juuuuust done at 350/30 minutes...the way where you wonder if it really should have been cooked a little longer.  So to cut down on time, I'll cook it at 375 or 400.  Otherwise, awesome.  I'll definitely make it again.

This was very good, I followed the recipe almost exactly, I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so just used Bakin' Miracle with Parmesan cheese instead of the Romano. Turned out delicious, will definately make this again.

Amazing! Stuck to the original recipe but added more lemon and only drizzled a little over half of the sauce on the chicken and tossed the rest with pasta. Yummy, yummy.

I made this for dinner last night and let me tell you, it was awesome!!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except for the Romano cheese.  I didn't have any so I subbed parmagiano reggiano and some shredded 5 cheese italian blend.  It was still delicious!  I made four chicken breasts.  Some reviewers said they pounded the chicken and rolled it, while others said they butterflied the chicken as the recipe was written.  I decided to try it both ways - pounded/rolled 2 breasts and butterflied the other 2.  Either way, it works.  The filling stayed in and the dinner was amazing.  Looking forward to left overs today and will definitely make this a regular dish on our menu!

Made this dish the other day as I have been enjoying cream cheese in a lot of recipies lately.  Think I will stick with my original stuffed chicken which is very similar but I don't use cream cheese, just the cheddar, spinach and mushrooms.  Did not enjoy the cream cheese/chicken combo.

I tried this tonight, and it was very good. It was a little bland, so the next time I'm going to try pepper jack cheese and also add some fresh diced mushrooms

Loved it, loved it. I did make a couple of small changes. Instead of chicken breast I used cow tongue. Much harder to pound flat than what AJFILLIPP said to do. I didn't have any cream cheese either so I used so really old and sour milk which also covered the milk ingrediant.Used old bread crumbs from the bottom of the bread box instead of Italian crumbs but did throw some parmesan on to keep the integrity of the recipe. Other than that, great meal.

Made this the first time about 3 weeks ago when I found it on Pinterest. Amazing flavour and so moist inside!  Was an instant winner with my boys. Just made it again last week for company and they were thrilled. The only change I made...I didn't butterfly the breasts because that was just too much chicken for one serving. Instead, I filleted them horizontally and used each piece as one serving. Perfection!

Cut way down on the total fat amount from 3/4 c to maybe 1/2 or less and use part olive oil.

Definately was not as good as I was expecting it to be.  I will try it again and use less cream cheese and maybe try cooking it at a higher heat.  This recipe freaked me out a little because the cream cheese never fully melted, the cheddar on the other hand, was completely melted.  Taste was creamy and on the richer side.  Over all, pretty good.

My husband who doesn't like chicken let alone lemon chicken loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different for his chicken is I just added the butter and garlic on top without the lemon.  I however, loved this receipe and it was really easy to do.

Very good. I wouldlike more lemon flavor and a crisper coating. Maybe marinate the chicken with some lemon juice? Put some cornflakes in the coating?  Any suggestions?

I made this recipe a few months ago and finally decided to make an account and review it since my family has been BEGGING me to make it again. It is a heavy dish but with that being said you can feed a lot of people for a small amount of cash, I made the recipe as directed, it fed my family (5 adults, 2 children) and we ended up having leftovers which still tasted just as good as when freshly made. Great recipe!

This was really really good and simple! Beware though, when you add lemon to garlic to saute it, the garlic can turn blue. Not appealing when you're serving it to company.

I followed the recipe and was thrilled with the results. Crispy toasted bread crumbs on the outside and melted gooey cheese on the inside. Love the garlic-butter drizzle. It looks nice too. So easy and quick to make. After reading other reviews I can use this recipe to make all kinds of stuffed chicken. 
This tasted like Chicken Kiev but one could easily change it up to a Cordon Bleu. I think any cheese inside would work
I took a picture and sent it to my boyfriend who is eagerly awaiting me to make this for him in 3 weeks when I see him.

I wanted to cook my spouse a nice dinner for his birthday..Anything he wanted. He chose chicken and this is what I made him. It was amazingly delicious and easy to make. He said that he felt like he was in a high scale restaurant. I changed a couple of things BUT did not add anything else. As for the cream cheese I used Herb & Garlic which gave it a really nice flavor and I used parmasean cheese in the bread crumbs that I seasoned myself. As for my spouse, he went on for 3 days telling me and anyone he talked to on the phone just how good and impressive it was. I will definitely make this for him again. Also I can't wait to impress my next group of company with this recipe.

This was amazing! After reading the reviews, I spread on the cream cheese and used shredded cheddar and mozzarella replaced the Romano cheese. One of the best recipes I've found in awhile. Will definitely make this again. Thank you to the original poster.

This was really good and easy to make.  I am teaching my 14 year old to be more active in the kitchen.  She put this together and everyone loved it.  Fancy enough for company and fast enough for a week night.

I made this on Friday night for my daughter that came home from college for Thanksgiving. I made it with linguine and roasted asapargus. I did double the sauce and the extra sauce after chicken was done cooking was used to pour over the linguine, with chunks of breadcrumbs and all. I personally did not like the presenation of that (MY FAULT) But EVERYONE LOVED the flavor it gave the pasta. I added bacon and fresh basil as well. They said it tasted like it came from a gourmet restaurant but better!!

I loved this recipe.  I put too much cream cheese in, but it was still delicious.  Instead of romano cheese I used a shredded mexican blend and it was just perfect.  I cooked it 350 for 45 minutes and within 10 minutes all the chicken was gone! The family loved it!, I will definitely make this one again!

I have made this a few times now and it always turns out fabulous. My family liked it so much it was all gone with in fifteen minutes! I like to use minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also like to use different cheeses, bacon infused cheddar worked really well.

Very good! I used Parmesan instead of the Romano cheese. I used 2 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic and 4 tablespoons of lemon juice. I have made this 3 times this month already.

This was soooooo delicious! I read the other reviews and used parmesan cheese instead of Romano, and I also didn't add the butter at the end. Instead, I minced the garlic real good and sprinkled on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. I also used cream cheese spread instead of regular cheese, it was AMAZING!!

I halved this recipe but doubled the lemon juice.  I followed the recipe exactly except seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and the breadcrumb mixture as well.  It turned out really well.  I had to bake mine an extra 10-15 minutes.  Very good!

I loved this chicken!

I had 2 chicken breasts, that I pounded flat and cut in half length-wise (but not completely). I eye-balled the cream cheese and cheddar cheese so that I was able to close up the chicken breasts, which I secured with some toothpicks.

I doubled the amount of lemon juice in the sauce and omitted the romano cheese because I didn't have any.

The cheese remainded in the chicken and it was simply DELICIOUS!

Amazing! I've made this for company a couple times and everyone always tells me how much they love it. I use shredded mild cheddar cheese and just pack as much cream cheese and cheddar in as I can without measuring it. I also add extra lemon to the sauce and I don't use any garlic salt because I don't think it's necessary. This is my favorite recipe on this site so far.

This is one of our FAVORITE recipes at home!!!! It is soooo tastey! A little difficult to work with trying to stuff cheese inside of, but I like a challenge.  I cook this all of the time.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!! :)

Just made this for the family and some friends and served it up with a Greek potato, red onions, tomato and courgette bake. Everyone thought it was gorgeous, the cheese complemented the chicken well and it was both succulent and  tasty. I used cheddar and some freshly made cream cheese with chives for the filling. For the breadcrumb mixture i used Feta cheese. I can certainly recommend this and everyone said that they will be making this dish again.

This is amazing! I used a blend of Italian cheeses instead, and served the lemon garlic sauce over asparagus, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Would be equally good with Cheddar and cream cheese, I'm sure. Easy to make, but would be an impressive dinner for guests.

good but to be called garlic lemon chicken i feel it should taste like garlic and lemon. next time i make it i will definitly add more of both. update made it again and used shredded cheddar and creamed it with the cream cheese  then cut it in 4tbs for each piece and that way it doesnt leak out of the chicken. i added way more garlic when it was cooking on the stove and as i was putting it in the oven i sprinkled it with garlic powder and a couple tbs of lemon juice over it!!! much much better!!!

I thought This was a Good Recipe - Used a lot more butter then Id like but everyone loved it :)  I added some fresh Raw green and Red pepper also some chopped baby bell mushrooms in with the cheese and it was Amazing!! When it was done  you could taste the pepper through out the entire piece of chicken! Also I Bread chicken often so I'm used to using Egg instead of milk. so i substituted that.  I served it with a mushroom rice to bring out the mushroom flavors (We're mushroom fanatics)   Id definitely make this again

This was good, but I too found the cooking time a little off.  I think it depends on how thick your chicken breasts are, so I had to add another 10 minutes to be on the safe side.  I butterflied the breasts, and spread a good hunk of softened cream cheese on the chicken breast then added shredded sharp cheddar. I closed it by placing several toothpicks on the seam.  Did not have any problems with leaking cheese.  Next time I make this, I think that I will had some chopped green onions to the cream cheese and use garlic salt instead of the minced garlic and maybe more lemon.  The garlic was not very pronounced, neither was the lemon.  This would even be delicious with blue cheese.  Overall a good recipe you can have fun with using your own ideas.  Thinly sliced ham would also be great in this.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I have made this several times.  It is always a huge hit.  We use garlic salt instead of minced garlic.  It works just as well.  We will have to try Panko crumbs since the crust does seem to come out a little soggy.  We made this for our very large family Christmas potluck of about 30 people (mind you I said potluck where there were several other main dishes), making about 24 large chicken breast thinking that people would only eat about half a chicken breast per person.  Well to our surprise there was not a thing left!  No leftovers!

It was pretty good. Cooking time way off for me.  Had to put it back in the oven for an additional 20 min or so. :( Once it was truly ready, it was pretty good. May have went a little overboard on lemon, but still good.

This was delicious! I thought 3/4 cup of butter was a bit much so I cut it down to 1/2 and it was still too much. Next time I will use about 1/4 cup of butter.

Nice!  Flavorful and moist.  Used a fat-free cream cheese so the flavor was not overwhelming at all.  Dipped in low-fat buttermilk, not milk and it worked out great.  You don't ned the butter on top but I would like a stronger lemon flavor next time.  Overall we loved this recipe and will make it again soon.

Delicious!!  Followed recipe almost exactly except I did not use as much cheese.  I had cheddar slices which i cut in fourths and then sliced thin slices of cream cheese.  Any more would have been overpowering to me.  I used part of the sauce over angel hair pasta & the meal was delicious!!  Would definitely serve to guests!  And my 9 & 5 yr olds said it was the best thing i had ever cooked!

*Update* This has become a family favorite!!  We have served it to several guests and they all loved it. We always make extra sauce to serve over angel hair pasta, we usually add steamed broccoli or asparagus to the menu and garlic bread.  This is a gourmet meal!!  LOVE IT!

I really liked this recipe a lot. My children did not. I think it was the cream cheese part. But very good recipe..maybe not so much for kids.

Well i served this for 4 children ages 7 through 3... I can't believe I appeased everyone's finicky tastebuds, myself included! We were all loving it! Didn't change a thing, except no lemon juice because i ran out. :-( I have been told I am required by LAW to cook this again, so I'll make sure and add some lemon juice to the mix.

Amazing! Could use less cream cheese.  Could also add bacon or extra seasonings to give it a little more flavor.

I made this for a big family dinner and it was a huge hit.  I served it with the Rosemary Mashed Potatoes and Yams recipe from this site, which was a great complement to this dish.

Some of the best chicken I have ever had!! I found it easier to fold the chicken over the cream cheese and then place toothpicks in it. Also baked for 45 minutes and it came out super moist.

These are to die for. I used thinly sliced chicken breasts, smeared cream cheese on them like they were bagels and sprinkled shredded cheddar on the cream cheese. Then I rolled them up and secured them with toothpicks before dipping them in the breadcrumbs. I cut way back on the butter to about 4 tablespoons instead of 3/4 cup. I melted the butter in the microwave and stirred the minced garlic in. So good. I went back for second, which I don't usually do for meat!

This recipe was fabulous!!  I never tend to follow a recipe exactly but it was a great starting point. I didnt have any cheddar but had shredded colby and monterey jack. I added that to the cream cheese. I also used onion and chive cream cheese. I think that was what made it so good. This is definitely a keeper!!

This is a great recipe!!! I made it as listed the first time and have since altered it. I like to stuff the chicken breast rather than butterfly them. Also I like mixing the cream cheese (I only used half as much cream cheese as listed) and cheddar cheese prior to stuffing it into the chicken. I added some fresh garlic to the mixture. You can add according to your taste. Adding a slice of pepper jack cheese on top of the chicken just before it's done is amazing!

I love the fact that you don't have to pound the chicken breasts - just butterfly them.  That is such a time saver.  Excellent flavor. The whole family love it.  Will make again.

This was fantastic, I wouldn't describe it as 'quick & easy' but very tasty. I only made it once so far, but for a guy I was dating and he was amazed. I followed the advice some others gave about rolling the chicken out then rolling it up and it worked fine but next time I think I will try butterflying it like the directions say.

This was really good.  But instead of the regular cream cheese, I used onion and chives cream cheese to add more flavor to it.  I also used pepper jack cheese instead of chedder.  I would skip out on the garlic, lemon juice and butter next time because the cheese and cream cheese flavor is strong enough.  I will definately make this again.

This was a very good recipe. Like other users stated, I flattend the chicken and used cream cheese spread and shredded cheese. I made this for my family and we all enjoyed it very much. I have already been requested to make it again.  Cooking time was a little longer than 30 mins for me. I was also baking a side dish at the same time. I ended up baking it for an aditional 18 minutes. Just judge for yourself at the 30 minute mark.   Over all, this dish was pretty good. Definately reccomended.

i thought the garlic butter topping was a little too much/ half of that would have been sufficient! it was kinda greasy.... but overall it was good. took more along the lines of an hour to bake v.s the 30 minutes the recipe suggests

Very, very good!  Didn't have Italian bread crumbs so used Corn Flake crumbs with some spices.  Also used Parmasean cheese instead of Romano.  I thought for sure the cheese would all run out right away, but it stayed in and just a little came out at the end.  I used toothpicks to hold the chicken together.  Will definitely make again.

Very good. I too pounded out the chicken before I rolled them up. I wish the breadcrumb/cheese mixture would have been more crunchier. Very rich, will make them again for a special treat.

Its a good recipe but a bit too much cheese for me though so I reduced it and it turned out great. I did an onion-lemon-butter sauce since I'm not to big on garlic. I will definitely do this again

The chicken had a nice garlic and butter taste and I was just suprised I was eating cream cheese inside my chicken lol !! I would recommend pounding out the chicken...maybe it was just the breasts I had but it was hard to cut them and stuff without everything wanting to fall back out at you.. flattening the breasts more would have made the cream cheese and cheddar stay in.

very good & super easy. I liked that you did not have to brown/fry it first. I baked for alittle longer ~ 35 min or so. Also used half breasts & half skinless boneless thighs.

This recipe is amazing!!  I agree with previous reviewers - cut the amount of both cheeses in half.  This is so easy and delicious, I will make it over and over again!

I thought this was pretty tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly...just added a little more lemon juice, which I shouldn't have done. The lemon was a little too overpowering. I used the recommended amt of cream cheese, which I found to be fine.  It was a good dish for dinner, but didn't serve up well the next day for lunch.

This recipe is fantastic.  I halved it.  I normally wouldn't make something like this because of the fat content, however I decided to give it a try.  I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and used less butter than suggested.  Next time I may reduce it even more because it did pool in the bottom of the dish.  But the taste was incredible!  I also used a toothpick to hold the chicken together, and left out the garlic salt. I baked it for approx. 38 min.

I did not like the cream cheese in the middle and think it would be better without it. The crumb mixture and sauce were good however.

My boyfriend really enjoyed this recipe but I who had very little cream cheese in mine (b/c I'm not a big fan!) still wasn't thrilled with the combination. I think there are better recipes on this site.

Excellent taste and gorgeous presentation. I prepared it as described with the following few changes: 1) Sprinkled the 'inside' of the chicken with sea salt and pepper before placing the cheeses on top. 2) Used cold cream cheese. 3) Used toothpicks to secure the chicken. 4) Cooked for 40 minutes. I had very little cheese leakage and the chicken was moist and tender.

Yummmmmm.  This was heavenly.  I didn't change a thing (I don't think...I'm bad at measuring).  It was very rich but paired with some simple basil orzo and corn it was a very satisfying meal.  Mmmm.

Very tasty, tender chicken recipe! The filling was a little bland for me the first time, so I made it again with some canned green chiles in with the cheese-  Delicious!  Next time I might try some spinach, ham, or even bacon.  I will have fun with this recipe!  Thank you!

OMG Becky this is a great recipe! Canged it up a little bit, used a garlic jack that i had instead of cheddar and parm in place of the romano. added a little extra lemon juice and probably double the garlic. This dish has wonderful flavor and everyone i made it for nearly lick their plates! One thing i am going to try next time is dipping the chicken in the garlic butter insead of milk befor the crumbs and pouring the rest in the dish with the chicken to see if the breading will stay crunchier. This is definatly a new favorite. Oh yeah i had to bake about 10 more min, becouse the breasts i used were really thick. Thanks for the delish dish!

What can I say?  YUMMMMM Made this recipe for dinner last night and my family loved it. Only change I made was I softened the cream cheese and mixed italian herbs into it.  Then stuffed it into the chicken. Next time I won't be adding the cheddar.  Really don't need it with the cream cheese. Great Recipe!

awesome! DH loved it. I even ate a piece leftover the next day for lunch and it was fantastic- this recipe is going in the rotation. This would be delicious as chicken tenders without the cheese stuffing as well.

Incredible! So flavorful... the cheese mixture was perfect. BIG hit at my house. I ran out of butter and used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup.... this was still  more than enough butter. Will make many more times!!!

When this recipe is through baking is looks great, smells heavenly and tastes out of this world. You think your eating “Chicken Kiev” at a fine restaurant. It has a wonderful blend of flavors that really complement each other, but are not overpowering. The nice thing about this recipe is that it is easy to prepare and bakes in a short period of time. Just add a side dish or two and you have something for family or friends for even the most elegant of occasions.

Absolutely delicious, but too much butter. A bit greasy and heavy.  I would halve butter with chicken broth.  Maybe a splash of white wine......for me and the broth.

Wonderful taste. My husband said it was one of his favorite dinners I have cooked. I thought it was very simple to prepare. I scaled it back to make just enough for two, which there are usually leftovers because I typically serve my chicken dishes with pasta...NO leftovers! I would omit the lemon juice because i thought it threw the taste off. Overall, very good.

One of my favorite meals EVER. My husband and I love this dish.  We are cheese freaks so we don't mind when the cheese oozes out of the bottom...it makes that yummy 'cheez-it like' stuff.
I even put EXTRA cheese on the bottom to get that.  I'm making it for 6 of my family members tonight. I know they'll LOVE it!

I made this as directed, but served the lemon sauce on the side so my 5yr old son would enjoy the chicken.  VERY GOOD !!  Husband all ready asking when I am fixing it again.

i like this one but i had a few problems along the way.  my chicken breasts were to small to cut so i did what a previouse review suggested and rolled it.  i liked the turn out but i didnt put enough cream cheese, since the breasts were small i eye balled the amount instead of usuing what the recipe called for. it turned out good but next time i will use bigger chicken breasts and more cream cheese.  will make again though!

I didn't bother with the cream cheese since many reviews said it was over-powering & went with cheddar alone.  This chicken didn't need it!  It turned out so MOIST, cooked perfectly.  The lemon-butter sauce adds terrific flavor.  Will absolutely make again.

This is a very good recipe, it was a hit with my family! The only alterations I made were adding tomato to the chicken and cutting down on the cream-cheese. It was very tasty!

I used slightly less cheese than the recipe called for.  I also had to cook it about 10 min longer that stated in the recipe.  It turned out really well.  It had a good balance of flavors without being overly seasoned.  I will make this again.

Great Recipe.  I chose to stuff my chicken with a little bit of Spreadable Cream Cheese, Roasted Red Peppers, and a slice of White Munster Cheese.  They were amazing.  I also stuffed some with roasted Red Tomatoes that I found on the Olive Bar at Whole Foods.  Very YUMMY.

This recipe was good enough for me to serve to 80 people for a Sunday School class dinner!  The modifications I made to feed the crowd were:  pounded chicken day before, added garlic and italian seasonings to cream cheese mixture, used shredded cheddar, added egg to milk.  I rolled chicken up, didn't even use toothpicks-only minor leakage!  I assembled chicken rolls early in day, then just drizzled with sauce and baked right before serving.  Did have to re-pan after cooking, quite a bit of grease with butter sauce and cheese stuffing, so for presentation I put into clean pan for buffet.  Served with roasted asparagus and red potatoes with rosemary.  Guests absolutely loved it!!

This chicken is so delicious!! It has become an almost weekly dinner staple in my house. :) I definitely cut back on the cream cheese and added more lemon juice, as suggested by other reviewers. The cheese always oozes out...I have yet to try toothpicking the chicken...but I just scoop up the cheese that has oozed out and put it on top of the chicken. Sooo good!

It was so rich, I was surprised that I didn't have a massive coronary directly after eating it.  If I had though, at least I would have died happy, because this was a wonderful, moist, creamy and flavorful chicken dish.

I made this just as the recipe said and it turned out great. However all of the Chedder cheese need ooze out while cooking so next time I will have to think of a way to seal the CK better. But I will def be making this again!!!

This was pretty good.  I liked all the flavors together...not a huge chicken fan but this made it edible!  I scaled it down to 4 servings and used 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Next time I will pound out the chicken and roll it.

I am a very inexperienced cook, but I was able to make this for my boyfriend and it was delicious! My mom had a taste of mine and wanted the recipe. I followed the recipe but halved the cream cheese as many users recommended. Another change was accidental-- I accidentally switched the minced garlic and the garlic salt-- but it still turned out AMAZING.

This is a great recipe and was fairly easy.  I also did not use as much cream cheese but because I could not get it to fit.  I also forgot to dip the chicken into the milk but it still came out great.  Being from the South instead of Paprika I added Grounded Red Pepper.  It gives it an extra kick!

This recipe is great. I make it all the time for my wife and she loves it every time. One thing I do different is use a little less Cream Cheese and more Cheddar. But I love the recipe. Thanks!!!!!

Amazing!  I do think the cream cheese was a bit too much, so I'll try it with less next time.

I also pounded my chicken breast, and was generous with the garlic and lemon juice. I LOVED THIS CHICKEN!!! And better yet, my children said it was fantastic. I went easy on the cheese because I used sharp, and I will make this again and again. It's a keeper.

Amazing recipe.  When you thought there were no other ways to prepare baked chicken.  The cream cheese/cheddar cheese blend is what makes this recipe work.  Even if you dont like cream cheese alone, it takes on a new taste when melted and blended.  Use good quality cheddar, like Tillamook sharp cheddar.  I also suggest using the optional paprika, as the color jazzes up the appearance on the plate.  Can cut the fat a bit by using lower fat cheese. 

Will be making often.

This was ok.  The cream cheese was a bit much for me though.  Too rich I guess.  I think next time I would cut back on the amount I use inside the chicken.  Or maybe mix it with shredded cheddar so that I can just spread it on rather than slap a slab on.

Pretty good and cheesy.  But for some wierd reason when  I mixed my garlic with the lemon juice the garlic turned a blueish color.  It reminded me of blue cheese, I had to pick the garlic out when I served it.

I made this a few nights ago and thought it was pretty good.  I halfed the cream cheese (bf still thought it was too much, but I thought it was ok)and spread it on the butterflied chicken breast and left out the romano cheese (didn't miss it anyways).  My only regret was that I didn't have enough sauce.  I will make this again, but I will double the sauce (using clarified butter instead of regular) and use a flavored cream cheese...I bet garlic and herb would be yummy.

I reccomend this chicken dish. It turned out perfect and my family loved it. The chicken was perfectly tender and the combination of garlic, lemon, and cheese was scrumptious.

Based on comments, I seasoned the chicken really good after dipping in the milk. To me, the cheese stuffing didn't add much flavor just calories, so I think I'll omit next time, sorry. It's a good recipe so first try as directed and then make adjustments to your liking. Will make again. (UPDATE: I really enjoyed the next day!)

Absolutely divine!  My whole family (three younger siblings and parents) loved this recipe.  I did use less cheese than it called for, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. It's definitely a keeper.

We made this with garlic cream cheese and no cheddar.  The house smelled wonderful with the lemon-garlic-butter sauce cooking.  We'll definitely make this again!  The breading was a bit soggy but may have been from all the butter -will cut back next time.

Only suggestion is to use very little cream cheese. Made it for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it! Making it again tonight for another dinner party and I will replace the cream cheese with sun dried tomatoes instead. The cheddar is enough for the cheese content.

Awesome as is.  I only had frozen breast filets, but still made it the same way only I used 4 toothpicks to seal each breast.  They were pretty thick, so I had to increase the cooking time by about 10 more minutes.  The whole family loved it.  No left overs!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I have made it many, many times and everyone enjoys it. I add extra cream cheese because I love it so much. This time, I used lime juice instead of lemon and used shake and bake and cornflake crumbs for the coating. This recipe deserves 10 starts!

Definitely one of the best chicken dinners I have had in a long time. It sounds kind of complicated, but it only took about 15 minutes to prepare and it was so good. Very filling too.

This recipe was amazing!  I thought it was restaurant quality.  My husband thought it was only OK, he thought there was too much cream cheese.  I will defintitely make this again, I'll just make his piece w/o the cream cheese! :)

Easy and delicious.  I tried this since my husband is a cheese junkie and it didn't disappoint.  The chicken was nice and moist and we really enjoyed the lemon "zing." I'll definitely make it again.

Sooo good... I've made this several times, my family digs it. It's also a great dish to make when providing a meal for a family (a new baby, etc.) It's special, but easy and casual. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so buttery and cheesey and breaded that it was overpowering - after two bites it tasted too rich.  The concept was delicious, but I will definitely not make this again.

This is absolutely to die for.  Every bite is scrumptious. I used parmesan instead of romano -- great. I'll have to make this a LOT.

Great recipe. I did change a few things though, I had fresh grated parmasean cheese instead of Romano, and I didn't have any lemon juice so I just mixed some lemon pepper with butter and garlic salt. My fiance loved it. Although I do think next time I will mix a few seasonings with the cream cheese. Will definately be making again.

This dish was EXCELLENT! I substituted olive oil for the butter, and it was still wonderful! The only thing I would have done differently is used larger chicken breasts as I actually had a little cheese left over. This recipe was delicious. My husband asked for seconds, which never happens. Thanks for this tasty and creative recipe!

I used Provolone, instead of cheddar and cream cheese, and rolled it up in thin chicken breast (4).  I did everything else according to the recipe, it was very good.  My husband said I could make it anytime!!

I have made this three times now, twice baked and once grilled. I just pound the chicken breasts out flat as serve other people have suggested, finding it far easier than trying to butterfly chicken breasts.  Use a mild to medium Cheddard as a sharp doesn't seem to go as well with the other flavors of the dish.  If grilling, cook over medium heat until juice run clear.

Made with wild rice and steamed broccoli.  I poured the leftover butter/lemon sauce over my broccoli! After reading several reviews I made the chicken with a thinner slice of cream cheese and used shredded mild cheddar. Next time I will put more cream cheese and use a different type of cheddar. Needed a little more something...I did cut back just a bit on lemon; however, next time I will use full amount. Overall very very good! BF gave it an 8 out of 10.

These were good except I didn't taste much of the lemon flavor.  I was cautious not too add too much cheese so I used less than called for and still tasted good using lowfat cheeses.  My kids liked it, but my husband doesn't like his chicken stuffed, worrying about his chicken not being cooked through.  So he is the only one who didn't like it.   I served with rice and corn on the cob.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe, with the exception that I made half of the chicken without any sauce as my children are "sauce phobic".  It was a definite hit with them.  My husband and I enjoyed it with the sauce, but he suggested topping it with capers as he thought that would balance the lemon flavor nicely.  I also added a little bit of corn starch to the sauce to thicken it.  I will make it again but will probably work on the sauce a bit.  Thanks for a good recipe!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would...it was EXCELLENT!  My whole family raved and wanted to know when I would be making it again.  I chopped a small amount of broccoli to stuff inside the chicken, and used slightly less cheddar cheese than called for...about 1 TBS shredded.  It took about 40 minutes to cook.  This would be great to make for company!

This was pretty easy, and yummy.  I wouldn't classify it as company food, but that could be because there was so much cheese and butter it was a little too unhealthy for me.  My cheese-loving boyfriend was a big fan though.

This was pretty good. I served it at a church supper group that I was hosting. Most of my guests thought it was a variance of chicken cordon-bleu. I wish it could have been crunchier and not so soggy after adding the sauce, but overall a keeper. Thanks!

The lemon sauce was superb. I have made this dish twice but I feel like it was missing something. It was okay in my books.

Not Bad. We seemed to like it as leftovers better. 1/2" chunk of cream cheese would have been way too much, I used about 1/4" thickness and found it rich. Also not sure what I did wrong but there was definitely no lemon flavor. 3 STARS

INCREDIBLE! This chicken was wonderful - extremely tasty and filling but not too heavy. It is also very good for leftovers. I have passed this recipe on to some friends and will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

My husband says this is his new favorite dish and asks me to make it every time I turn around. I liked that it was also relatively easy to prepare and used ingredients that, for the most part, I generally have on hand. Great recipe that I have no doubt I'll be making forever!

This recipe was delicious and rich.  I made a few alterations out of neccessity.  I used chicken tenderloins, I eliminated the cheddar and cut the butter down to 4 T.  Instead of stuffing, I rolled the tenders in the breading mix and laid some cream cheese ontop of each.  I also added dallops of minced garlic ontop of the chicken.  They were great.  The lemon flavor was on the bottom of the tenders making them perfectly and ever so slightly tart and lemony.  I could even make this without the cr. cheese and it would still be a keeper.  Thanks for a great flavor combo!

This recipe is a little rich, but we love it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I've tried pounding and rolling the breasts as well and the turned about pretty much the same.  Some of the cheese will escape.

This was great! Not the quickest one to throw together, but everyone loved it. 
When low on time, I skipped the bread crumbs and it was still very good. 

We'll definately have again.

This recipe was awesome.  I did adjust it a little bit though because I didn't have a lot of time.  I didn't have Romano cheese on hand and didn't feel like doing the minced garlic.  Instead of melting everything in a seperate saucepan I simply put dabs of butter right on top of the prepared chicken, squeezed some lemon juice on top, and sprinkled on some garlic salt.  The chicken came out sooo moist.  My husband loved it and he's not even a big cream cheese fan!

This was too heavy. All of the ingredients together sounded so good, but I was very disappointed. It tasted ok but it just made me feel sick after a few bites. I won't be making again. Thanks anyway.

The flavor is to die for - but you've gotta be a cheese lover, or yikes!  I'm going a little easier on the cream cheese next time, maybe even substitute swiss?

YUMMERS!!!!!!!!!!!
I fixed this for dinner tonight & it was very good.  The cheeses were awesome and the tastes were wonderful.  It was very moist and delicious and there wasn't one flavor that stood out or overpowered the dish, a very good mix of everything.  We will definitely be making this again!!!!

This dish was phenomenal! I only made 6 six servings but it was great!  I didn't have romano cheese so I substitued parmesan and cut 1/4 inch slices instead of 1/2 inch.  Thank you so much for a quick, easy and yummy recipe!!

I scaled this down to 4 servings and it came out great.  Very rich though, I served it with rice and patted the oozing cheese on the rice as a "sauce".  I did as suggested by pounding the chicken and rolling - the recipe did take a while and I'll make it again when I have more time. I did not notice an overwhelming lemon or garlic taste, came out just right.

"Honey, this one's a keeper" (The quote from my boyfriend last night after I made this dish).  This is a really fabulous recipe - I didn't change a thing (and I normally do!) and it turned out great.  It's definately rich and not low fat or low calorie - but worth it.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!  It's going to be a regular at my house.

This is absolutely delicious!  I followed the advice of others and rolled the chicken after I stuffed it.  It looked beautiful and tasted even better.  I made it for company and no one left a bite on their plate.  It was also very easy to prepare.

Wonderful recipe!  Very moist chicken and a big hit with my in-laws.  I did cook it about 50 minutes though as the chicken breasts were rather large.  This one is a keeper!

This was absolutely awesome. It is very rich & creamy.  I made it with boiled potatoes which was an excellent compliment.  My daughter didn't care for it - but she is a picky eater.  The only change I made was that I used garlic powder instead of real garlic, my family doesn't like biting into pieces of garlic.  This would be an awesome recipe for company and I can't wait to make it for my mothers birthday.

Wow!!!  The boyfriend and I both agree---five stars on this one!  I found this easy to prepare, but with a restaurant quality.  I used low fat cream cheese, but this IS very rich.  DELICIOUS!  My chicken breasts were rather thick, so I baked them for a little over an hour.  They were worth the wait!  I will make this again--(in fact, we will be eating the leftovers for dinner again tonight :)

The garlic-lemon-butter sauce really made this recipe. I doubled the amount so I had more to pour over the chicken after it was done. Yum! I did do like others suggested and pounded the chicken breasts then rolled them up and secured with toothpicks -- it made them very elegant looking. I also browned them in oil in a skillet for a few minutes, then just popped the pan into the oven. They came out very moist and juicy! The only other change I made was cutting the amount of cream cheese, as my husband isn't crazy about it. But I liked the flavor it gave. I also used shredded cheddar cheese as it was what I had on hand. If -- no, WHEN -- I make this again I will experiment with different cheeses, mainly for my husband's sake. :)

Very good recipe. I used Boursin cheese instead of cream cheese. I used a 5 oz clunk of Boursin for 6 chicken breasts and shredded the cheddar (extra sharp) - it was DELICIOUS! I ended up with way too much bread crumb mixture and had to throw a lot out, though. Will definitely make again. Everyone loved it!

This recipe is excellent! I made this last night and my kids loved it. Even my extremely picky 4 yr. old at just about every bite. I didn't have any minced garlic on hand, so I left that out. This recipe is a keeper!

So rich, so cheesy, so good.  Let's see, I used Pam instead of oil, parmesan instead of Romano, and I went wild with the garlic and lemon juice.  And I loved how it turned out.  I did have to let my husband finish my chicken bc I got full pretty quickly, but I enjoyed every bite nonetheless.  I didn't have a problem with cheese oozing out - I used shredded Cheddar and for the the cream cheese, I just kind of used my best judgment as I spread it on instead of placing slices in there.  Anyway, I approve!  :)

Good recipe! Everyone loved it. Great blend of flavors! I used Italian flavored shake & bake for chicken mixed with freshly shredded parmesan , 2 LARGE cloves of garlic and 2 tlbs. of lemon juice with the butter. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it had way too much butter!! I will only use half the amount next time! I had to drain alot out half way thru cooking. Easy recipe.

We loved this.  Prep took me longer than stated, however. My chicken breasts, I guess, were thinner than normal;I had a terrible time cutting the breast "pockets,(and I have done before) so after 4 trys I rolled up like other reviewers.  I did use the paprika on top to add some color for presentation. I did not use the garlic salt as I thought the butter would make it salty enough. We loved the mix of cheddar and cream cheese with the garlic/butter sauce. It is rich, but not as rich as an Alfredo.  Separately, I cooked brocolli flowerettes and added to a platter with the chicken. Presentation was five star also, with the green brocolli.  Will make this for company as I think almost everyone would like this. Great recipe!

Our family actually gave this 4 1/2 to 5 stars.  The flavor was wonderful and it looked great served.  I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and I think next time I would cut down the sliced cheese (cream & Cheddar) by about half.  Aside from that the kids and adults all loved it!

Tasty! I cut down on the garlic and added more lemon like suggested, and I think it was a little too lemony.  Next time I will do as the recipe suggests.  I also had a little bit of leaking so I might flatten the breasts and roll them next time like others have suggested.

Just starting to really cook for my family. Easy to make and it was wonderful. From my husband that is a picky eater to may five year old son who doesn't like anything new, this was a hit.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I pulled it out for company, it even filled the 6'2 bottomless pit! I found that cutting the cheeses into several smaller slices to arrange between the breast was very helpful.  I also used parmesan instead of romano.  Came out perfect!  Try it!

Excellent!!  This recipes deserves more stars!  I made this for my husband and the first thing he said was, "can you make this again tomorrow?"  We both loved it!  Everything was great, althout I did pound the chicken a little before starting to butterfly each breast.  The chicken was very tender.  I can't wait to make this for company.   Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

There was more prep work than I am used for cooking chicken breasts, but the payoff was worth it. Having completed the recipe once, the time should go much faster next time. It definitely is a recipe I will cook for company!

EXCELLENT! Extremely tasty and easy to prepare! I didn't have any Romano so I shredded some Asiago. Used about double the butter to pour over the chicken and it was just right! We LOVED it! Great post!

Thought this was good.  Not fancy enough for company in my opinion, like others said, but great for family meal.  Forgot to buy cheddar, so I just used American.  Fine substitute, I thought.  Used seasoned salt instead of garlic salt, and parmesan instead of romano cheese because it was on hand.  Next time I would like more lemon flavor to help cut the richness, but liked the garlicky flavor.  Might put some herbs inside breasts next time, too.  Fun recipe to alter / play with.  Lots of possibilities....

Soooooo delicious!!  Make sure you stuff the cheeses far enough down there that it doesn't all leak out.

I thought this recipe was pretty good! my family loved it but told me it had way to much garlic. try putting more lemon juice and less garlic, it makes it much better, gives it more ZEST!!! but other than that this is a great easy dinner that the family will love over and over again

I actually said "wow" when I tasted it for the first time.  This has to be my favorite chicken recipe ever, and was actually pretty easy to make.  The recipe works for a couple or for a crowd because the recipe pares down vey well.  This one made its way into my favorites cookbook and I am already getting requests to cook it again.
