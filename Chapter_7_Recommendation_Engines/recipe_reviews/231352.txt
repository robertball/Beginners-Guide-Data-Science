Chef John, your recipes never disappoint and this one is no different. I used a combination of tilapia and snapper, and half & half instead of the cream because that's what I had on hand, and it was fantastic! I served it with a simple green salad and some bread, and it was a great meal that looked way more expensive and labor intensive than it was. Thanks for sharing!

I would rename this "addictive fish stew" as it was decadent and flavorful and very easy. I live in Dubai and could not find fennel bulb, so used about a half a tablespoon of fennel seed instead.

Loved this!.......I followed the recipe except I used a can of 2% evaporated milk instead of the cream......its fantastic......learned that when in Nova Scotia and had a fish stew!...also added 3 times the tarragon...red pepper flakes instead of cayenne!

Thanks Chef John. This is incredibly delicious!!! It's simple and the taste is amazing. You're the best. Can you please do more fish recipes? Furikaki or macadamia nut crusted fish with some of your "out of this world" sauces! Thank you for sharing. I also enjoy your sense of humor. ??????????

Easy to make and super delicious. My husband is allergic to fish, so at the end I added 2 cans of clams with juice. It was a big hit. I also cooked this in my pressure cooker, after step 2 I cooked at high pressure for 5 min and it came out perfect. Added half and half (instead of the whipping cream, since that's what I had) and clams, and everyone loved it. Great recipe!

Wonderful! First time cooking with fennel and it adds such a mysterious awesome flavor in the background. All the flavors blended so nicely. What a great stew!

But for the fresh tarragon (I used dried and let it simmer a bit before I added the rock fish), I made this exactly according to the recipe and found it excellent.  It's a keeper.

When I saw the title for this recipe I knew I had to try it.  My husband I both love fish and so I made it last night.  I thought it was very good.   But the fennel and tarragon were a little overpowering/sophisticated for my palate.   My husband on the other hand is IN LOVE with this Stew!    :)

I was in soup mode one night and was trying three similar types of soups that used similar ingredients. This one was the clear winner and I have tossed the recipe in my "Tried and True" file of recipes!

Perfect Fish Dish for a Dinner Party. I used it in MASON JARS and when the company opened the mason jar cover and smelled all this deliciousness it was a HOME RUN! To use the mason jar method, prepare the recipe up to adding the fish. Put the raw cut up fish in 4  clean empty mason jars. Divide stew evenly between the jars . Cover the stew using the the mason jar covers. Place the jars in a roasting pan with 2 inches of boiling water. Place in 250 degree oven to keep warm until ready to serve.

This was simply AMAZING! It required ingredients I had never used or even tasted before, but I went for it! I'm so glad I did! I did not make a single change and cannot think of one that I would make the next time.

Made this last night for my guy and I, WOW! SOOOO GOOD!  He only eats fish (is a pescartarian) so i switched up the chicken stock for seafood stock (Swanson makes one now) I used red snapper, but am thinking shrimp, scallops, & cod might be good too!  Will most definitely make again!!!

I love the elegant simplicity of this dish--it tastes like I spent all day preparing it, but it was quite simple and quick to put together. I think I would prefer a more mild fish than rockfish next time, though that may be personal preference. There is so much great flavor in the broth and veggies that rockfish overpowers the dish.

Delicious! I had to improvise on the fennel and whipping cream, used oregano and aromat, and half and half, added power greens. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Sensational results but simple to make even if you're not all that handy in the kitchen.  Don't skip any of the steps and it's helpful if you do the chopping prep  (besides the fish) before you begin cooking. Only changes were 2 small cloves of garlic & dried tarragon with the potatoes and fennel, and fresh dill instead of fresh tarragon as I couldn't find any.   Made this for a  Friday Lent dinner and huge hit.  Will make again.

I did not add the whipping cream, to avoid lactose, so I put in two tablespoons of coconut oil and some added liquid and I added a sprinkling of aleppo pepper and some smoked paprika. It came out very well.

I've made this many times with different types of fish. Absolutely delicious. Tonight I am thinking of making the basic stew sans fish and then lay a seared individual portion of halibut over it.  Or perhaps I'll make the leeks/shallot/fennel mix, creamy mashed potatoes and the seared fish. Just re plating the basics of this recipe because I have a beautiful piece of fish.

Ok, This is one of the best recipes on the planet. OMG! I would only change one thing, go from heavy cream to half & half. Don't skimp on the fresh tarragon. Now I need a cigarette.

Great recipe.  I only made 1/2 the recipe because I wasn't sure my family would like it.  We loved it.  I didn't have fennel so I didn't include it.  I substituted red wine for white, added red onions, used Swai fish and turkey broth. The tarragon adds the perfect flavor for this soup. Will be making this again...and agin.

Creamy and delicious recipe that is quick and easy to prepare. 
Replaced the rockfish with catfish. 
Replaced the fennel bulb with 1/2 tablespoon of fennel seeds as indicated by another reviewer. 
Replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk. 
Otherwise, followed the recipe as written, and it comes out wonderfully.

The first time I made this was when I was looking for recipes to use some leeks I had bought.  Now, we keep it in our rotation of fish recipes because we enjoy it so much!   It  is a simple recipe, simple enough for family dinner, but unique and flavorful enough to also make a nice dish for company.   
Definitely give this recipe a try!

I really liked this recipe but my kids and wife did not. We all have pretty diverse palettes but this just didn't sit right with them. I used frozen cod that was a little chewy so maybe  that was their issue.

I added clam juice with flash frozen (cleaned) baby clams and shrimp, crab, and scallops. Served with crusty bread and wine for a summer dinner with a girl friend and husband out on the deck. It was a total hit. Thanks John for the start !!!!

Perfect one pot meal! Very good and easy. This is perfect for our attempt to eat healthy. I used Alaskan Cod, followed Chef John's instructions exactly, just added a chopped red pepper. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow, yum yum.

Excellent and easy. I used Oregon Ling Cod and added a little extra broth since I like to dip sourdough bread in my soup. I also added a little extra cayenne pepper over what is called for as I enjoy the extra spice. The flavors of fennel and tarragon combine perfectly in this dish to give a uniquely French flavor. Absolutely superb!

Good stew for winter. Used Hawaiian ono instead of rockfish, added a bit of red bell pepper for color and fennel leaf for garnish. Next time I would cut potatoes into smaller pieces to cook faster.

Wow, wow, wow!!  We literally just made this tonight & it was AMAZING.  I can't wait for my mother-in-law to visit so that my husband & I can make this for her.  We enjoy cooking for her.  Anyways, we made this exactly as the recipes says, except we used Costco's frozen halibut.  Just perfect.  Hoping that leftovers are just as good

I will never understand why chefs and cooks don't use Seafood stock or broth when making a SEAFOOD soup.   I made it with Kitchen Basics Seafood broth.  Very tasty.

This stew is MONEY. I made it with lactose free whole milk because one of my guests is lactose intolerant. It was still absolutely amazing. I'm not a fennel fan but I trusted the chef and it ended up adding a nice, fresh, but mild flavor. The red snapper at my market was very expensive so I used a few bay scallops, shrimp, and flounder. All my guests loved it!!!

Another fabulous recipe from Chef John.  My husband went wild over this stew, said he could eat it every night of the week.  I made a few additions to the recipe.  Sautéed fresh garlic with the leeks and scallions, used Seafood Stock instead of Chicken broth, added shrimp and scallops, capers and diced pimentos. I also microwaved the potatoes for 2 minutes prior to adding them to the stew.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

I am giving this a 4 because my husband, who loves fish, loves this stew! I am not as big of a fan of a strong fish flavor, however,  I just gave him the chunks and I quite enjoyed the fish flavored vegetable stew :)

This completely took me by surprise. I had no idea the flavor it would have. This is so good. My oldest child, who hates most things sea food, ate this without complaint. Even said he'd eat it again. It is silky, and wonderfully flavorful.

Delicious!  I agree with others.  If you follow the recipe exactly...you can't go wrong.  I used cod, and it worked out well.  My husband, however, wasn't a fan.  He doesn't care for main dishes that have a sweet taste.  I guess I won't be cooking anymore dishes with fennel.  I really didn't taste the sweetness until he mentioned it.  In my opinion, it is very subtle.  In conclusion, very good flavor and easy...just follow the recipe!  Thanks Chef John!

My whole family decided this recipe was a keeper! It was very filling especially with breadsticks. I couldn't find fresh terragon and used a tsp of it dried. I also was unable to get fresh fennel so used a tsp of fennel seed instead.

They didn't have rockfish at the fish market so I used salmon and cod instead with great results. The broth is perfect, a bit creamy but not too thick. A recipe to save to impress guests!

Made this with tilapia, chardonnay, vegetable broth (for the non-meat eaters) and added baby carrots and corn for color and sweetness.  I also accidentally doubled the cream which turned out to be happy mistake.  Even my husband, who claims not like fish, loved this very decadent stew.  Great recipe which I plan to use often.  Thanks!

This is a phenomenal fish stew. It is elegant, interesting, delicious, and pretty - the kind of dish you'd expect in an excellent restaurant. I did sub out half of the cream for 1% milk, and I also used cod instead of rockfish. I also added some fresh parsley together with the tarragon. Served with fresh bread and salad. I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! I couldn't believe a fish stew could get five stars, so I just had to try it! The recipe is absolutely delicious as is.
I add more leek because my family loves leek and I also like the baby red potatoes cut in hal because I prefer them that way. I also add more of the liquids (wine, broth and cream) because it is delish!
Thank you, chef John, for a new family favorite!

This is an excellent recipe, both my wife and I were very happy with the results! The only thing I did different, is I started by rendering some bacon in the sauce pan first. Then followed the recipe as instructed.

Great, simple fish stew. I used the whole blub of fennel (what would I do with 1/2 a left-over bulb of fennel???) and red onion (since I didn't have any shallots. While the fennel was sauteing the aroma was a bit over-powering, but the final result was not too fennelly. I used quartered regular red potatoes, and they cooked up just fine. Here in the land-locked Midwest, fine seafood is a near impossibility, so I used a mess of frozen tilapia fillets, which quickly crumbled into tasty little bits. Instead of straight salt, I used Old Bay seasoning. And since this is a stew, most any vegetables can be tossed in; spinach would be great. I added cooked carrots tonight with the left over stew. Delicious.

I didn't have fennel on hand, so I put in 5 cloves into the sauté along with a cup of chopped celery, both serving as a substitute for the fennel. Next, I thought it said crushed cayenne, so used that instead of the ground cayenne. Everything else was the same. I made this with cod. The wine I used was a good chardonnay. This was absolutely delis! I will pay more attention to this particular chef. thanks for making it simple and relatively easy. I will add a photo of the pot. I used a heavy duty pot. And I used Better Than Bouillon for the stock.

This is sooooo good!  I followed the recipe pretty carefully, as I had not made it before, the only change was I added a handful of jumbo shrimp that I had in the freezer that needed to be used.  They were a nice addition.  I used haddock for the white fish.  Excellent!

I made a few tweeks to mine because I have some picky diners lol anyway I didn't use the leek I substituted mushrooms, shrimp and instead of shallots I used green onions.  I did the rest like the recipe said and it came out delicious even my two year old ate it and finished his whole plate. Yummy!!!!

This was so enjoyable and easy to make.  Have tried it a few times with different white fish, including cod.  My recommendations to others have resulted in the same great reviews from them as well.

New family favorite.   My husband always says he's not in the mood for fish, so I tried this hoping to get him to eat it since we had a giant bag of tilapia filets in the freezer.  He loved it and so did the kids.  Unanimous make again vote.

Unbelievably good! I made exactly as written (I used cod). My husband was skeptical at first, but asked for seconds in no time. The flavors in this dish are amazing. Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING! I always trust Chef John's recipes. This man has yet to lead me astray. This soup is rich and delicious. I had never used fennel before so after I cut it I smelled it. I was less than pleased (as it smells like licorice to me, and I cannot STAND that scent) but the combination of flavors was positively astounding! I would give this 12 stars if I could.

This is an excellent, simple recipe, and it's flexible enough to adjust to "what you have on hand" kinds of changes. For instance, a yellow onion plus some garlic works just fine substituted for the leek and shallot, turkey stock works in place of chicken, cod in place of rockfish, and a bay leaf for seasoning substitutes nicely for the tarragon. My two older kids (5 and 19 months) both ate it without complaining (the 19-month-old had 3 servings), as did my husband, who is not really a seafood eater. I'll be adding it to our list of dishes that we make regularly.

Delicious fish soup!! I made it without fennel or leeks but used sweet onions instead.  Blended white sweet potato with yukon golds and everyone (even the kids!) loved it.  Definitely let the oniions/leeks cook for15 minutes.

This was a wonderful dish! Will fix for family as well as guests because it is so different. I live & fish on the Chesapeake Bay and catch lots of Rockfish so I am always looking for a new way to prepare the fish. First time using fennel and seldom use tarragon but will try other recipes using them again. I fixed pretty as per the recipe (as close as I ever come to fixing a dish according to a recipe!) and don't believe I would change anything!

Made this today. Loved it. You're right - very good for us less-than-confident cooks because timing doesn't have to be precise. Nevertheless, it turned out perfectly. A really great lunch on a cold dreary day!

My daughter (age 29) and husband loved this stew. I prepared it pretty much according to the recipe.  I did a dry run to access it's potential for being served at a dinner party and felt that it was just a little too complicated for me to serve to company. I enjoyed leftovers for lunch.  My suggestion is to cut the potatoes into smaller pieces.  I found that I wanted to do this with knife and fork prior to eating it.

Made this for dinner tonight. Even my 3 and 4 year old girls gobbled it down. This is excellent with some crusty french bread. Also, I didn't have a bottle of white wine open so I used vermouth instead. The color came out golden and the taste was somewhat sweater. Really great dish! Thanks!

I used elephant garlic since it is actually a form of leek and more flavorful than leek (mild garlic flavor).  Also used water and wine at 1 cup ea.  Plus a pinch of cumin seeds.  Great flavor.

This was a great stew. Flavor was what I was looking for and it was super easy to make. This is great when you are crunched for time and have a very hungry family. Plus my 2 year old could not get enough of it.

I had to improvise since I could not get a leak. Added a small yellow onion and fennel seed in place of the bulb. still turned out great.
