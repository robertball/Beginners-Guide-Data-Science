I'm sorry.  I really like bacon, and I really like bananas, but it smelled so awful I wasn't able to tolerate the smell long enough to even attempt to eat it....

I remember seeing this recipe and thinking it was strange.  After making breakfast one morning, the bananas were sitting right there just waiting to be eaten.  Purely out of curiousity, I made this recipe.  I often think that bacon makes food better.  Unfortuntately, this was not one of those times.

rgibbs-jcounty  This recipe is great. I also make it with butter & brown sugar & I don't use bananas that are too ripe.  Try it with plantains but add sugar, honey or brown sugar as plantains are not naturally sweet.  Really very good.

I love anything with bacon and I think warm/cooked/fried bananas are a delicious treat. I added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to the bacon grease and stirred until it dissolved before I placed the bananas in the skillet. It gave the bananas a little sweet crust to them and the whole dish was delicious!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. Let the bananas cool down a bit and sprinkle on a little bit of powdered sugar.
