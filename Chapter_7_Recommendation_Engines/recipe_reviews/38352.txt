The best watermelon ever.  You can't even taste the Vodka(that is a good or bad thing).

This didn't quite work for me, even though I followed the directions to a T.  The vodka never absorbed into the watermelon even though I gave it 24 hours.  Maybe if I had drained the juice out first??

Good recipe.  Instead of Vodka I used Captain Morgan Parot's Bay.  It is a pretty good flavored rum.  We went to the beach and had a blast.

You can't even taste the vodka.  We tested it out again with really cheap vodka and still couldnt taste it, which was amazing.  Watch out, you will get drunk and not see it coming.  Use seedless watermelon- the seeds got annoying. def give it hours to soak.

I brought this to a block party and I let it saturate overnight like the recipe calls for.  It was WAY too strong.  I used 1- 750ml bottle and that was WAY too much!  Def won't be serving this again.

I've been making this for years (we call it Drunken Watermelon though), using this exact method. I made it for a 4th of July party this weekend and everyone loved it. I love that you can use cheap-o vodka because you can't taste the alcohol, no matter what. Thanks! :)

These are excellent...We did one quite a few years ago for a get together and it was a huge hit.  We however used Everclear instead of Vodka...but it is not available in all states!!!

I tried this method and it didnt soak up into my watermelon.  I left it in the fridge overnight and it seemed that not even a small amount went into the melon.  I even tried using a funnel.  After the failed attempts, I just figured it was because my melon was too juicy and wouldnt take in anymore liquid. So I just cut it up and threw some different rums over top of it.  It was good... but I thought the alcohol ruined the flavor of the watermelon.  For some that wants to get tipsy, this would be easily done since it goes down so easily.  Thanks for the recipe idea, I prefer mine plain, but this may be good to make again for a big bash!

The watermelon didn't absorb the alcohol so I can't give this a good rating.

This method will not work on a seedless watermelon by the way. 4 failed attempts led me to someone who knew better than I. Rather, either the "pour into the hole and slice channels in all directions from inside the hole so the booze will sink in", or injecting the booze with a food syringe will work.
