Very good, and yes similar in taste to RL. I did make a couple of changes. I added some garlic powder and a couple dashes of baking soda to the dry ingredients. I also needed to use @1/8 cup more flour. The dough was still really sticky but the biscuits rose nicely in the oven and had a pretty light consistency. Don't overmix or you will end up with hockey pucks! I used a 4 cheese mexican blend and it gave them a nice flavor. I will make these again and again-easy and great flavor. Thanks!

These were excellent.  As an "avid baker"  who has not been to culinary school but bakes my own breads everyday, the key to any biscuit recipe is not to over mix them, otherwise you get the glutens going and they will be dense and hard--just mix enough to blend the ingredients and don't over handle the dough.  The only change I made was to add some more garlic and I use whatever cheeses I have available---they are always awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, and if you use parchment paper on your pans, the biscuits won't stick!

These biscuits were woooonnnnnderfulllll!!!!!  I added twice as much salt, a bit more cheese (two big handfuls of cheese, to be exact), and freshly ground pepper.  Also, the cheese was a finely shredded Mexican cheese blend, not just cheddar.  I think they'd be even better if you added some grated cheese, but also some small cubes of cheese so there'd be some really cheesy spots.  I can't figure out though why you need a full 1/4 cup of butter to brush on top, I used less than half and the biscuits were still soaked!

These were OK. The taste was there, but not quite the right consistancy it would have if you had used a baking mix(ie.Bisquick). I worked at a Red Lobster many years ago and would  eat these on the regular and they also used a baking mix with their's. However this is a good alternative if you don't have the mix. FYI, use parchment paper or spray on the pan because I practically had to chizzle the biscuits of the pan.

definately double up on baking powder!  I used buttermilk and they were PERFECT! Crispy outside, soft and tender inside.  I also froze my butter for about 10 minutes then grated it into flour mixture and tossed everything together.  Wonderful!

My boyfriend called these "addictive". His only complaint was that the cheese didn't melt inside. I think that had something to do with the temperature being so high, which baked the outside but didn't give it enough time to bake the inside. Next time I'm going to try baking these at 400 instead of 450 for around 17 minutes. UPDATE: I reheated these a couple of days later on 350 for 5-10 minutes, and they were absolutely perfect. My mom and brothers all thought they tasted exactly like the buscuits from Red Lobster. If I can get the heated through the right amount the first time, I'd say these are definitely a 5 out of 5.

I doubled the baking powder and I used lactose-free whole milk and margerine instead of butter because I have a child who struggles with a slight lactose intolerance. I shredded half of the cheese and cubed the rest into small small bits.  I dropped the batter for these biscuits into greased muffin tins. I served these with Easy Tortellini Soup, which is also from this site. The boys thought they were GREAT--they used a lot of them to sop up the soup from their bowls. Next time, I think I'd like to make them even more garlic-y and add either fresh minced garlic or a teaspoon of garlic powder into the biscuit batter.

Ever in search of the Red Lobster biscuit.  I usually make another recipe on this site that calls for baking mix (Bisquick).  I was out, so I went with this one, and I think its better.  But, I did doctor it up some after reading the reviews.  To the dry mix -- I added some garlic powder, more salt, double the baking powder, about a 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and some fresh ground black pepper.  For the butter topping -- about half the amount of butter, double the garlic, and added some parmesan and parsley.  I also used Pam on the baking sheet, since many complained of the biscuits sticking.  Also, in my oven (and I used a thermometer) they took more like 15-20 minutes than the called for 12-15.  Happy biscuit eatin'!  Had with some ham and bean soup.  Yes!

I thought these were very good.  I was a little hesitant in trying this because of the rating given by the "AVID BAKER, on her way to CULINARY SCHOOL"......We really enjoyed these.  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making homemade biscuits from scratch..and WOW!!!! I did take a lot of suggestions from other reviewers and it came out picture perfect!!! The suggestions I took were: NOT over mixing, Freezing the butter for about 15mins in the freezer and then grating it in; doubling on the baking powder, adding a pinch of baking soda and some garlic powder. They rose perfectly and the taste was amazing, they were the most fluffiest, yummiest biscuits ever!!! (To me even better than RL as it wasn't as greasy) also only made a little bit of the butter garlic glaze and brushed just a tad on it! I already have it planned to where we'll be eating these again at least twice this week, thank you so much Marge and suggestions of other reviewers!!!! I will never go back to mixes!!

My husband and I both agreed this tasted better than that seafood place.  Maybe, because they were fresh out of the oven.  I did add a half cup more of cheese, and as garlic lovers, we felt the garlic amount was perfect.  What a great recipe!!

I followed this recipe exactly and found that it calls for too much milk.  I made these biscuits twice in 2 days, trying to get them right but the first time, the biscuits came out flat like cookies.  I reduced the amount of milk from 1 cup to 1/2 cup the second time around and found the dough to be stiffer, less runny, and a much better consistency for biscuits.  When I spooned the biscuits onto the baking sheet the second time around, the mix remained somewhat stiff, rather than flattening and spreading on the baking sheet.  I recommend reducing the amount of milk if you want to follow this recipe.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, but I am sure without my additions, this recipe would have been wonderful.  I converted to make a double batch and put half the dropped-dough on a greased cookie sheet to freeze Biscuits for later use (after frozen will put in freezer bags).  I used garlic powder instead of fresh minced garlic, also added additional garlic powder to the flour mixture since we are garlic lovers in the household.  Also added fresh parmesan to the cheese, and also added parsley to the butter baste.  Kids loved it, husband cooking another pan of it right now since he didn't he thought just getting 3 was a tease (they are quite addicting).  Biscuits stuck to the pan a bit so using greased pan on the next batch to see if helps.

Now if these were entered into the State Fair and I was a judge, I suppose I'd say they weren't light enough and not fluffy enough.  I'd probably say, too, that the texture was off and that they were frankly a little on the greasy side.  I'd probably also dock these for sticking to the pan somewhat, making them just a tad challenging to remove.  And the one cup of milk called for in the recipe was about 1/4 cup too much - good thing I noticed that from the get-go and didn't dump it all in at once!  But I'm not a judge, and these weren't entered at the State Fair. Hubs and I liked 'em a lot - rich, a little crunchy, and really satisfies the "fat tooth."

These biscuits turned out flat. I was unimpressed. I won't use this again. My kids not finishing is not normal. The mix was too wet as far as I could tell.

Very tasty.  Paired with a spaghetti dinner and they were easy to make and nice and garlicky.  I thought they were going to be pretty dense, but they were nice and fluffy.

Looking at other reviews, I did a full TSP of baking powder, 1/2 cup more cheese. I baked on my Pampered Chef bar pan to prevent sticking, results: wonderful biscuits. My DH said they were better than RL's biscuits... Thanks Marge!

Excellent, though I did add some changes based on other reviews and my own tastes.  I added onion and garlic powders to the flour, added baking soda, chopped chives, extra salt....and parmesan cheese.  I will make these again, using a more strongly flavored cheese.  Thank you to the other reviewers who mentioned not over mixing...I barely stirred till I had uneven lumps and mine were light as a feather.  Thanks for sharing!

These were really good, even though I used Parmesan cheese instead of Cheddar, and just 3 Tbsp melted butter (I didn't want to use more than 1 stick of butter for this recipe -lol). Love how chewy-crispy they were, with a good garlic-cheese flavor, yum! Served them with a tomato, fresh chives and parsley salad with basil pesto, herbed scrambled eggs and bacon on the side for a pretty hearty yet balanced breakfast :) Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars! These really do taste so similar to the famous RL restaraunt. I added onion powder,parsley flakes, and a little garlic salt to the dry dough mixture. Like other reviews state, definately don't overmix. The dough is very sticky and sort of hard to work with, but they came out light and fluffy and declicious! Will definately try these again. I will double it though, these only made about a dozen- and that just wasn't enough to go around!

I'm giving these a 3 star because my boys devoured them and wanted more!  But since I didn't want them to have a heart attack with dinner, I only let them eat two! If it were up to my husband and I, we would only give these 2 stars.  I doubled the recipe and was a little freaked out by the amount of butter these called for!  When I took them out of the oven they were literally frying in the butter on the pan.  I could not get myself to brush any more butter on top since they were already soaked in it, so I ended up lightly sprinkling some garlic powder on top while they were still really hot.  They weren't terrible, I just found these to be a little bit too dense and GREASY...not very light and airy like the "seafood restaurant" biscuits.  I did two things to this recipe - I added 2 teaspoons of dry basil which kind of kicked up the flavor a little bit and then when I baked these, I put aluminum foil under the pan.  This really prevents any overbrowning on the bottoms a makes a beautiful, even colored biscuit.  Works great with cookies too!  These were ok but not my favorite.  Probably won't make them again -- I'm still freaked about the butter!

These are very flat and dense.  Judging from past reviews and pictures it wasn't my error.  I personally prefer my biscuits flaky and airy.  I won't be making these again.  The only change I made was the topping which was delicious.  I melted 3 tbsp butter and mixed with 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp parsley.  I brushed it on top instead of the butter and minced garlic.  Thank you anyway!

I think this recipe is great!  And so do my children - they beg for it.  I did follow recommendations to add some more cheese, so I added about 1/2 cup more.  I also cut down a little on the butter in the recipe as mine seems to bubble out of it onto the baking pan.  I added pureed garlic to the batter rather than doing the spread on the top.

Scaled to make 6--added garlic salt.  Followed others advice of not over mixing and my biscuits did not come out flat.  However, they were dense (I cut the butter into the flour mixture with my pastry cutter).  Dense and flavorless, would not make again.  Did not taste like Red Lobster or Ruby Tuesday bicuits.

I followed the recipe exactly but mine came out as flat as pancakes.  They were tasty, but my family laughed at me when they saw them, haha...  I baked them on a silpat instead of a ungreased baking sheet, so that's the only thing I did differently but I can't imagine that was the problem.

What did I miss? The dough was soupy-too much milk, I had to add extra flour. They came out more like thick pancakes. Not enough flavor either. If I decide to try these again, I'll re-rate, but probably won't waste the ingredients. Sorry:(

They were ok...I think next time I will make smaller ones because when I made them they just didn't have the flavour that I was seeking? They were good and I will make them again but with a little tweek here and there.

These biscuits are really good.  However, the cheese in them made it hard to tell when they were fully cooked.  I would also recommend using garlic powder or salt as opposed to canned minced garlic.

These are really good.  I doubled the salt (only needs it if yu are really into salt, like my family!) and added 1/2 cup of parmesan.  I also put a little parsley into the garlic butter.  Texture inside is just like in the restaurant.

Fabulous with very few changes.  I added the extra baking powder as recommended and garlic in the biscuit dough.  Was running short on butter so I used butter flavored Crisco in the dough instead of butter(this also helps them be fluffier and not as dense).  Didn't overwork the batter as also recommended and they turned out wonderful.  Brushed with melted butter, minced garlic and parsley.  Might add a tad bit more salt next time.

Thought it turned out pretty good. The baking tip some of you left really makes a difference. My biscuits have previously been too hard and now I know the trick is to not overmix the batter. I used extra sharp cheddar and added baking soda and garlic powder. I also froze the butter for 10 minutes and grated it like some of you suggested. I taste tested 3 out of the 11 I made so make 2 batches!

These were delicious.  I followed the other reviewers advice and doubled the baking powder while adding a pinch of baking soda.  I used a ton of cheese and added some garlic powder to the batter. The biscuits are moist and cheesy and delicious. I baked 6 in a muffin ttray and the remaining 3 were baked on a cookie sheet. The ones on the sheet came out rather flat. I would not recommend using a baking sheet for this recipe, but a muffin tray. The biscuits baked in the muffin tray held their form and had a good consistancy.

These are good! I thought they might need more flour, but I left the batter alone and it worked out just fine. More flour might have made them too dry. I think you do need to add a little more salt and a little more cheese than called for; hence only four stars.

I added some extra cheese and put them on parchment paper so they wouldn't stick and they turned out great! I didn't use a whole 1/4 cup of butter to brush them with though.

These taste pretty good and are simple to make. However, they were somewhat greasy and stuck to the baking sheet to the point where I had to cut them off with a knife. Next time I will bake them on parchment and cut down on the butter. Thanks!

These were really good! I've made them twice, once as is and once with some changes. They were much better after adding some garlic to the dough and doubling the salt. I also added a lot more cheese because...well I love cheese! They baked kinda funny but I think that was my fault as I have never baked biscuits before. I will try again with this recipe as it tastes wonderful!

Wow! Just made these for our upcoming camping trip and they are amazing!! I am not very good at baking and found these to be very simple. I followed other seasoned baker's reviews and made sure not to overmix the batter. I also took another reviewer's advice and froze then shredded the butter into the flour. It made it much easier to combine. I doubled the salt and used a garlic/herb shredded cheddar. Try these, you will LOVE them!

I was disappointed in these.  Though they certainly looked delicious, they tasted doughy and bland.  I could barely taste the cheese in them.  With a lot of tweaking I might come up with a good alternative, but instead I think I'll just try one of the other recipes on this site.

These were pretty good.  Definitely did not taste like red lobster biscuits.  I'm pretty sure Red Lobster biscuits are made with bisquick and there is garlic powder & parsley brushed on top.   That might help it a little.  For some reason, the crust tasted like cheese-its, haha... which was definitely a good thing.  These biscuits will taste like whatever cheese you decide to use.  The cheese affects the flavor the most...Very good texture! yum.

These were not good.  Which was depressing considering all the high ratings.  I followed the instructions and didn't overmix, but they were still heavy and did not taste at all like the Red Lobster biscuits....

These were not good. I make a lot of biscuits for my family & thought I'd try something different. Big mistake. They didn't rise & were very dense... hockey puck like.  I did not over mix, that was NOT the problem. I use "baking Powder biscuits II" from this site. They are great with a handful of cheddar & a clove of garlic added to the batter.

these biscuits are amazing!! especially with the butter and garlic topping.. i added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt to the butter topping.  i read the reviews and did not handle the dough very much at all.  as well, i chilled the butter and using a box grater, i grated the butter into the flour mix; makes cutting it in so much easier!  enjoy!

I thought I was safe with all the high ratings, but these didn't raise at all!  I had cheese garlic pancakes.  The whole batch went into the garbage.

These were incredible.  After reading the reviews, I doubled the baking powder and added a 1/4 tsp of baking soda.  I also was sure to grease the pan.  They were incredible and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These are great!  

I would not advise brushing butter over them, though, as they are fairly oily without it and I don't think they need the extra flavor (or calories :P).  I would just mince/puree the garlic then toss it into the dough.

I just finished making this recipe and it was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  I did make a few changes that were suggested and they came out very light.
I added 1/2 tsp baking soda, used Buttermilk instead of regular milk (I had some on hand), increased cheese to 1 1/2 cups and added the 1 clove minced garlic to the dry ingredients.  For the topping used 1/2 clove of minced garlic and parsley for colour.  This was simple and fantastic.  The key to getting light biscuits is DON'T OVERMIX!  Enjoy!

YUM!!!  I made these tonight - at the very last minute - and they were great! I had a beef stew simmering on the stove & when it had about 20 minutes to go I thought "I want biscuits with this!" So I found this recipe! I'm SO glad I did!  It now has a permenant home in my recipe box.  I used 1/4tsp garlic powder rather than minced garlic - I wanted more of a 'punch'.  And I feel you can never have too much garlic!! Thank you very much!  These were wonderful biscuits.

I normally make the garlic cheese biscuits on the back of the Bisquick box, but I'm almost out. I thought I'd give this recipe a try, and I had no idea what I had been missing! I loved this recipe! I doubled the salt, added more cheese, and used garlic powder in the butter. They came out great! I used non-stick cooking spray on the pan and had no problems removing the biscuits.
Thank you!

These were horrible. Disgusting in fact. As an avid baker headed for CULINARY school... I am not one to screw up measurements...and followed all instructions. These were bland, needed much more salt, and MUCH more cheese. Stick to "Garlic-Cheese Biscuits" from Cheryl Weeks that you make with Bisquick. THOSE are amazing. (I suggest doubling the cheese and using 1/3 c. water and 1.3 c. milk!)

I used whole wheat flour, doubled the BP, added garlic powder to the dry ingredients (because I was out of fresh) and used frozen shredded extra old white cheddar. They turned out great.  I use whole wheat flour in almost everything I make without changing amounts or directions unless specifically told to in a recipe.  I made 10 biscuits with the recipe, any smaller were going to be 2-bite biscuits. Next time will double, with a family of 8, can't make anything in a single batch!  But these passed the first try test with flying colours!

I was out of biscuit mix, so I needed a from scratch recipe.  This recipe is not going to work and I don't want to add a little this and a little that to make it right.  When I view a recipe, I expect the ratings to be made on the exact recipe.  Biggest problem for me was that they did not rise.

Tastes sooo good! I did change a few things though.  I use baking soda instead and light cream instead of milk.  I also opted to not melt butter and mince garlic, rather I added garlic powder to the biscuits.  They are so light and flakey and I baked them at 400 degrees to cook the insides as well as get a golden brown top.  I could eat a ton of these!

Just made these and they are delish, even I like them and I'm not a big fan of quick breads of this sort, I prefer my gluten yeasty and crisped.  I had to make a few changes to suit our tastes.  First, I didn't shred the cheese, I cut it into little chunks, I figured they'd be less likely to get lost in the biscuity flavor that way.  Second, I subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat for the AP, I love the taste of all purpose, but whole wheat doesn't leave me feeling bloated.  Third, I used a combo of plain yogurt thinned with milk, I think these biscuits needed the sour flavor boost.  Fourth, I didn't make them into drop biscuits, I prefer a more formal look for my biscuits so I rolled and cut them into hearts and stars (!FANCY!).  Last, once I cut the dough and plopped them onto a cookie sheet, I slid them straight into the freezer.  I think allowing the butter to cool down after all that manhandling, makes the biscuits fluffier.  Mmmm good!

These were a huge hit! Followed the advice of others to not overmix...I was very careful to just barely mix ingredients and also added garlic salt to the dry ingredients.  The butter on top of the biscuits is overkill and these would be great without it (and a little healthier)

I made this recipe as written but using Gluten Free all purpose flour.  I did add a dash of pepper and 2 big hand-fulls of cheese.  Next time I will add garlic powder and more salt, I think that will do it.  Overall Just OK.

These were really delicious. However, I found they could use a bit more garlic. I added garlic powder into the dry flour mixture, and omitted the minced garlic in the butter mix at the end. They were more flavorful that way, and, as many people have mentioned on this recipe, it tasted a LOT more like the Red Lobster biscuits. Extra cheese never hurts, either!

I used Biscuick and 1.5 cups of cheese. My guest enjoyed them but I thought they needed more of a bite .... garlic probably would help. This recipe just didn't wow me .... I probably won't try these again ....

I was extremely disappointed with the appearance of these biscuits, but they were delicious and simple to make compared to other recipies I have tried in the past.  I wanted to try this new recipe because of the cheese and simplicity of the recipe. The texture was great, and it was super simple and an easy to follow recipe.  I followed it to a "T," but next time I will work  on making the biscuits more appealing visually. Oh, and the biscuits were really small, so if you want decent sized biscuits, double the recipe.

I cut this down to 6 servings.  I made it as instructed and it was excellent. I didn't feel like you needed to add any extra flour, it should be put on the pan wet. It was done at 15 mins.   I did spray the pan, but I'm not sure if I needed to.  Yum!

They were delicious.  I wanted to lower the fat just a little and reduced the butter to 4 Tbsp.  I added a diced green pepper and substituted 'jalapeno flavoured' cheese.  I also left off the top coat of butter.  1 tsp of garlic powder could be added to the mix if you like garlic.  We loved them so much, the biscuits are all my husband and myself ate for lunch!

My husband ate NINE of these last night! Followed the instructions exactly, except baked them on 350 F for about 20 minutes. They were a real hit, and I loved having a from-scratch, preservative-free (no baking mix) recipe for these. Thanks!

I've made these twice now and they've turned out delicious! The only thing I had to do was add some garlic/parsley salt on the top after I brushed with butter because they didn't have enough saltiness for me. They turned out kinda dense after cooling but they were still good. I think it was because I added extra cheese.

These biscuits were amazing.  The butter in the dough makes them so yummy and moist, much better than the basic bisquick recipe.  I froze half of them and they thawed beautifully.

I rate five stars with the alterations i chose to try before trying the original recipe. I used 1 and 2/3 cup of flour, 1 tsp of salt 1 tsp of baking powder 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 cup and 1 tbsp of butter (chilled in freezer for a few minutes before cutting into dry mixture) and 1 cup of milk also chilled and 1 1/2 cup of cheese. Chilling the milk and butter makes the biscuits very fluffy and tasty not hockey puck like at all. Good Luck

We had mixed feelings on these biscuits. The picky 5-year old loved them, my 7-year old, who will usually eat almost anything, did not like them at all, my husband said they were OK and I finished half of one. The alterations I made were using less butter on top after baking and baking these on a parchment-lined sheet. When I took them out of the oven, there were little puddles of butter surrounding each biscuit. This is why I used only a little bit of butter to brush on top. They were just SO greasy, I could barely eat mine. Thanks for posting but I won't make this one again, just not for us...most of us, that is :)

Made it exactly like the recipe says too.  These are awesome!  We only made one recipe the first time and next time we swore to double it.  Only make as many as you will eat because they aren't good left over....that is if you have any left over.  We've made it enough times that we have noticed that it is much better if you use sharp cheddar.

Wow! These are great & not difficult to make at all! I made some of these to add to the gift basket I made my sister for Christmas. My sister just moved into her first house and doesn't really know how to cook, so I printed the recipe for her favorite dish (linguini & clam sauce) included all the ingredients, lined the basket with a nice kitchen towel & all the necessary utensils. The bisuits were a wonderful addition since she would never have made them herself!

Loved these! I followed suggestions from some other reviewers and made these changes: I doubled the baking powder, I used extra cheese (by about 1/2 cup), I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the batter, and I put the butter in the freezer for 15 minutes before making the biscuits and grated it into the flour mixture. Turned out great! I may have to play with the temperature on my oven because they were very brown on the bottom after only 12 minutes, but that should be an easy fix.

These biscuits are awesome. I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and added a bit of baking soda with a little more baking powder than called for. since i didn't want them to look flat. the first batch i made came out good/very good. i got busy doing something, so after 2 hours of the dough sitting there, i came back and finished baking them. now these after sitting for a while came out PERFECT!!! the look of them was beautiful, like a smooth biscuit. not rocky looking like the first batch. You must try them. u'll love them. my whoole family was amazed.

Very very good. Baked for 20 min on a ceramic pan, had excellent "crunch" A   bit greasy, but less cheese / butter next time will fix that.

I have made these biscuits twice. The first time I made them according to the recipe. They were delicious. But the second time I used a combination of Kasseri and Asiago cheeses and added garlic powder along with the minced garlic. They were awesome!

I tried these twice.  The first time they stuck to my nonstick pans.  The second time, I sprayed a muffin pan with baking spray and they came out very easy. They were not light and fluffy like regular biscuits, but they were so good, we ate them all that night.

Absolutely delicious. They taste just as good as the Red Lobster biscuits, especially for being really cheap and easy, not to mention forgiving. (I used the wrong amount of cheese, and Velveeta at that...) My brother and my mom were raving about these - we couldn't get enough! I share the recipe all the time.

These are really good. I've made them a few times for family gatherings and they are always a big hit.  They're easyer to make compared to my old recipe where you have to roll the dough out and cut them out.  I don't know if I took the advice from a review but I used parchment paper to cook them on which makes clean a breeze. I also agree with a review that you don't need as mush as1/4 cup of melted butter to brush over top after they are done.

Not nearly enough baking powder. Not a good recipe  will not rise with that small amount of baking powder. Use at least 2 teaspoons or a tablespoon baking powder

Well they look lovely, though they didn't rise as expected or bake through. Though looking at these photos they are somewhat normal. I went all out on this recipe. Weighed my shaved frozen cold butter, cheese and used half cheddar and half parmesan. Used buttermilk. Used 2 cloves minced garlic into the dough along with fresh basil and parsley. I doubled the baking powder as per suggestion of others. I baked them on an aluminum pan with parchment. I added one small clove garlic to the melted butter with some chopped parsley. I should have trusted my gut and baked them at a lower temperature. Also not helping was I made 9 of them as I didn't see until later it was for 12...

The bottoms were already browning at 12 minutes. Checked at 15, I cut them in half at 17 minutes and was incredibly disappointed to see a dense almost dough like texture. I then lowered the oven temperature to 400 for a few more minutes, after I hit the 20 minute mark I lowered it to 350 and I baked them for probably 25-30 minutes. My husband still enjoyed them and they were edible, but very disappointing.

I don't think I'll try this again.

I had no bisquick in the house as I usually made cheddar bay biscuits, so I tried this recipe.  In looking at the ingredients, it seemed too little baking powder.  I was disappointed in th fact that these biscuits didn't rise, they seemed heavy.  I appreciate the go too, the kids still ate them, they were just not light enough to satisfy me.  Is there a better portion of milk or baking powder to make these better?

I wish I would of read the reviews first; had to add more liquid and I guess I over-mixed the recipe because they did in fact look like hockey pucks.  Some of these reviews should have been incorporated into original recipe.

Dangerously Delicious!!!  Hubby says give it 5 of 5 stars and I have to agree! 

I made only a slight change of adding a bit more flour for high altitude cooking and not so much milk add milk a little at a time otherwise it may come out too wet and flat.. 

My only other suggestions would be to double the recipe because they will fly off the table!!  Yummy!

Doubled baking powder because other people said so, plus extra cheese.  Used half whole wheat flour because I ran out of white.  Not great, but easy to make, quick to bake, nice taste and texture. Only made 9, not 12.

Also good with Parmesan and pepper jack cheeses. I just threw the garlic in with the batter and skipped the extra butter. These are fatty enough.

Next time, I will grease the pan. These stick a lot.

It was definitely worth making a double batch very yummy as is but I think I will I had more baking powder at the next go-around just a note cooking on aluminum foil and remove them while they are hot otherwise you will not be getting them off

Delicious! I took the advice of others and doubled the baking powder, added garlic powder to the dough itself and added a pinch of baking soda. They were so good that I have to make another batch because I ate half of them while waiting for dinner...

These turned out really good :) I followed the recipe as is - my only disappointment was that they weren't as fluffy as Bisquick Cheddar Biscuits. I might add more baking powder next time and see how they bake up. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great in terms of taste, it only lost a star due to the tediousness of "cutting the butter." It takes a while, but is totally worth it if you want to replicate the buttery pockets in RL biscuits. Add a bunch of Old Bay and you're golden. I also used whole wheat flour, which was actually a good way to balance out the saltiness of the recipe. Highly recommended.

So good!! My husband's addicted to these. Add more cheese, (About 2 cups), add some garlic powder to mixture + a little more salt bake at 350F so the cheese can melt before biscuits bake! don't need that much butter to put on top of biscuits after cooked.

I just made these, and I thought they were really good. I think the key is just to combine the milk and cheese with the dry ingredients and not overwork it. Like another reviewer, I'm not sure why 1/4 cup of butter is needed to brush on the tops. I used about half about that. Also, as good as the biscuits were, I thought they were missing something. I'm not sure what. When I make them again, I will probably add a little more salt.

Holy crud, these are good! I also doubled up on baking powder, added garlic powder, and another 1/4 tsp on salt (making the total 3/4tsp). Methinks the oven temp is too hot because mine were a little too dark on the bottom and just a tad underdone on the top and inside. I mixed in some tarragon with the garlic butter over the top too, that was nice. Used aluminum foil. Will definitely be making these again!

I too increased the baking powder to 1 tsp and I also added two cups of shredded cheese.  Someone posted the cheese in the middle did not melt.  Did they shred their own cheese or use pre-shredded cheese?  Pre-shredded cheese will never melt like shredding your own because of the chemicals they put on the pre-shredded.  
Very delicious, kid approved!!

Two words: crumbled bacon! Absolutely everyone was disappointed when they were gone. I used more cheese and doubled the baking powder, also added about half a cup of baked and crumbled bacon. OMG wonderful!

These were very good!! The flavor was great. My husband gets really excited when he sees me making these. It is weird because i find these are better if you precook them, let them cool, and then reheat in the oven or microwave before you eat them. I do recommend doubling the salt. i've tried the other recipes using bisquick or other mixes and they were not as good. those turned out overly fluffy and not nearly as good.

I doubled the baking powder, added an extra cup of shredded cheese, and a larger clove of garlic that I put through a lemon zester into the dough itself. Came out beautifully. I've never been to RL recently, so I have no idea what there's are supposed to taste like, but these were amazing and will now be a family staple in my house for gatherings.

We had these tonight with spaghetti. They were pretty good. Like some other bakers, I just added the cheeses I had on hand (cheddar & mozzarella). I wasn't a big fan of the garlic on top of the biscuit uncooked, even with garlic powder mixed with dry ingredients. Next time I will mix the garlic in with the cheese and milk. All around, pretty solid recipe & quick when you don't have garlic bread or other breads to garlic up.

These are delicious!  My family, including two teenagers, love these.  They would like to have them everyday if I would make them.  The only difference I did and its just a short cut is to add Garlic Salt to the butter at the end when putting the melted butter on the biscuits.  Its just a short cut from chopping, peeling and smelling like a garlic clove.  So I melt the Butter and some Garlic Salt, it depends on your taste of how much and then I brush that on to the biscuits.....YUMM!

I've made these a few times and it seems to be the only recipe my family loves. They don't get too dry... I sometimes will add a bit of sour cream so they'll stay more moist for a longer period of time ( my husband likes to bring them to work with soup, stews etc )
We're just nibbling down on them right now with some chicken.
Yummy!

Really good but I did make changes that were suggested in the reviews.  I used 1 3/4 cup flour 1/2 teas salt 1 teas baking powder 1/2 teas baking soda 1 cup milk 1 1/2 cup cheese only 4 tablespoons butter (that I put in the freezer for a bit then used my shredder to shred them in the mix) and I used quite a lot of garlic powder with parsley.  They did not need any more butter than that and I did not use any kind of topping.  They were really good and my kids ate 3 each!

I liked the flavor, but they were flat and dense and felt there was actually too much butter in them.  If I did make them again, which I'm not sure that I will, I would cut down on the butter and add more baking powder.

Since so many stated that their biscuits were flat I took the advice of others and baked mine in a 12 count prepared cupcake pan and doubled the baking powder. Cut cold butter into small pieces or use grater for ease in mixing with the flour. I used a cookie scoop to place the sticky dough into the pan.  They turned out beautifully.  Easy and quick recipe that requires no rolling or cutting of dough. This is an extra plus since the less you handle a biscuit dough the fluffier the biscuits will be. For added flavor, next time I will be adding garlic to the dough instead of just brushing tops with garlic butter. I decreased my oven temperature to 375 degrees. This recipe definitely is a keeper!

I really liked them.  I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, but will cut back to 1/2 tsp. next time.  I upped the baking powder to 2 tsp since similar recipes call for 1 T.  I froze the butter like others suggested and used a grater; then mixed it in with the dry ingredients with two knives like I was cutting spaghetti.  I also upped the cheese to 1 1/2 cups and tried to barely mix the cheese and milk - it was still floury in a few places.  I wouldn't say they rose, but didn't flatten like cookies either.  They looked like the photo and those served at restaurants.  I placed golf ball sized balls onto ungreased parchment paper and although they did not slide off they were easily removed with a spatula.  Used preminced garlic in a jar for the butter topping and the rolls soaked it up nicely.  I will definitely serve these rolls with fish or other seafood in the future.

Amazing recipe! After reading a few other reviews here are the changes I made and it came out beautifully on the outside as well as the inside: 
Plz bare in mind that I decided not to make little spoonful biscuits, but instead used my "already dirty" 1/4 measuring cup to equally scoop out the mixture onto baking sheet which made moist and bigger biscuits like at the RL restaurant. 

-double-up on salt & baking pwder
-start preheating at 400 F and bake for 17 min.
-then bring temp up to 450 F for another 5-7 min.
-while they are still baking, brush the biscuits with the butter-garlic mixture and repeat once they are out of the oven.

Enjoy!

Loved them.  Went easy on the garlic in the butter.  I would be willing to bet that Red Lobster puts garlic salt in their butter, not actual garlic.  I like this better.  Thanks!

Love these! Very easy and quick to make. The only thing is that I would reduce the heat just a tad and bake a minute or two longer. Tastes just like RL!

These are the best! A nice flaky and savory biscuit. Reminds me of the biscuits we once had at red lobster, but better! I'll be making these often.

I did not care for this recipe. They were not fluffy, but very dense.  No flavor at all.  Without greasing the baing sheet, they stuck to the pan extreamly bad. I do not recommend this recipe at all!!!!

I followed the recipe to a T and the biscuits didn't rise very much. They tasted good but next time I will definitely follow other reviewers' advice and double up on the baking powder so they won't look like cheese cookies again as my 3 year old called them. Also, I can't figure out why you would need 1/4 cup of butter to brush onto the biscuits when 2 TBSP would have been more than sufficient. I had a whole bowl of garlic butter "soup" leftover.

Oh my!  These are good!  Made them to go with a soup on a cold evening.  I tried suggestions of adding a bit more salt, baking powder, cheese and lightly brushed with garlic butter.  Wow!  Thanks!

Very good biscuits.  For a more garlicy roll, add the garlic to the batter and cut the 1/4 cup of butter.

These are wonderful! Especially with  1/4 tsp Old Bay added to the dry ingredients.  I felt these were very heavy with 5 T butter so I cut down to 3 T and simply sprinkled with garlic salt after removing from the oven and the results were great.

These were great! I doubled the baking powder, added a touch of baking soda and I added garlic salt to the melted butter and they were exactly like Red Lobster. DO NOT OVERMIX like others said or you will have a tray of flat hockey pucks.

These were amazing! Best biscuits of my life. Just make them now. My only thought was the butter for the tops was a lot, so i only used about half as much as they called for and it was the perfect amount.

I made these biscuits to go with our dinner tonight and they are dangerously good! I added about 1/2 tsp of baking soda, about 1 cup of marble cheese along with about 1 1/2 oz of cheddar cut into small cubes. These were super quick to whip up - I will make these again and again.

Absolutely delicious! A great recipe to use if you don't have any Bisquick on hand- it's probably cheaper this way, too. I followed the advice of other members of just barely mixing the ingredients to keep them "fluffy" and lowering the baking temperature to 400 for 12-15 minutes. An instant hit!

These were really tasty, fast and easy....however....I totally left the bottoms stuck to the pan!  They stuck pretty bad and I'm not sure why.  The recipe clearly says ungreased baking sheet but clearly greasing was much needed.  I'll keep the recipe though and make it again.  Otherwise the taste was great.

I made the following changes: buttermilk instead of milk, 1.5 cups of the Italiano blend cheese, and cooked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.  I think 2 tablespoons of butter is enough for the topping, though--I used 3 and it was plenty.

Result: awesome.  They taste very similar to the RL biscuits.  My boyfriend's roommates inhaled about 10 of them in a couple of minutes.

I have made these twice now and they came out a bit on the heavy side. I think I will just stick to the Bisquik bag. It makes 8 biscuits, costs about $1, you only add water, and they taste just like Red Lobster.

I made these with whole wheat flour, instead of AP. That contributed to the density, I'm sure. They were good and simple to make, however I wish I had sprayed my pan, as they were difficult to get out. I'll make these again and tweak flavors, but a good base recipe, for sure.

These were really yummy similar to the Red Lobster biscuits.  But as some other reviewers said they were heavy.  I don't know if I overmixed (I tried really hard not to).  I used 1tsp of baking powder, 1 and 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese, and 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Next time I'll try it with less butter since they were really buttery.  They oozed out butter while they were baking and even though I only put 2 or 3 tablespoons of butter on them at the end it was still too much.

Pretty easy recipe. I made the mistake of trying to use the parchment paper; the biscuits stuck to it and I couldn't get them off. I do not recommend trying that. Otherwise, good recipe.

Personally, I think these biscuits are better than the ones they serve at RL. I served them with a tomato tortellini soup recipe I found at another site and it was like dipping wonderfully chewy, moist, and cheesy breadsticks into a creamy marinara sauce. The only change I made was to follow the recommendation of other reviewers to add baking soda. This was unanimously voted "a keeper".

I don't know what I did wrong, but these were more like greasy pancakes when I made them. :( Although I could definitely taste the "restaurant" taste, I'm unsure if I will try them again.

Since we were snowed in today I decided to make these biscuits along with Cheeseburger Soup also from this site.... these were just delicious!!! I always used to make bisquick drop biscuits but after trying this recipe ( I think this is the 2nd time I made them) I no longer make the mix biscuit mix... anymore! My guys scoffed them up!!! Thanx Marge for sharing such a good and easy recipe!!

These were good but not great.  I found them to be pretty bland.  On my second batch I added garlic salt and that helped a lot.

It should say in the recipe not to over mix when you over mix the biscuits become flat and not as light. I dont think they taste like RL's. The garlic taste wasnt the same. They were ok though and quick to make. I did add more cheese and still i think i couldve added more.

Super easy to make and very tasty. A very easy addition to dinner and can be whipped up with stuff I typically already have in the house.

Great flavor, my only complaint is that they turned out pretty flat and would have been better had they been fluffier.  Thought maybe I stirred them too long the first time so I tried again...still flat.

These were pretty good but not excellent enough to be 5 stars.  I did leave off the butter and garlic on top but did add garlic to the mix itself.  If I make these again I think I would add even more garlic for a stronger flavor.  The next morning they were a nice addition to breakfast though!  I put some butter on top then put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  Yum!

My grandmother passed away this past august before any of her daughters or grandchildren got a chance to get her recipe for cheese biscuits. This is as close as I have ever gotten! I added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder to the dry mix and I omitted the garlic from the butter mix for brushing over the biscuits. They came out perfect. Thank you so much for sharing these!!

My friends and I wanted to make these to go with dinner one night since we loved the ones from red lobster. I would recommend greasing the baking sheets before dropping the dough onto them. Our bottoms came out to be a little burnt, but we still enjoyed them!

SOOO good! Me & Hubby DOWNED these and ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day! Make sure you use COLD butter and dont overmix, the pieces of butter are what keep them light @ crispy! I also added 1/2 t garlic powder to the dry ingredients before mixing! a definite keeper!

These were good, but a just little dense and a little bland. Next time I'll add some herbs and double the baking powder.

I don't know why so many reviewers used baking soda since the recipe called for baking powder.  I used 1tsp baking powder, other than that, didn't change a thing (oh, and because we are garlic lovers, I used 2 minced cloves in the butter glaze).  These are del-ish!

Great recipe and I especially like that it is not made from a mix.  When I see recipes that call for a seasoning mix or canned soup, I know immediately that I will have to make changes.

Great recipe!  Doubled the baking soda, used 1/2 cheddar jack cheese and 1/2 Parmesan cheese (all I had on hand).  Also cooked at 400 for about 20 min to ensure melty cheese!  Quick and easy!

I get requests to make these all the time. They are so simple to make! I omit the butter and garlic topping and just add 1tbsp of garlic powder to the flour mixture. I then scoop them with a cookie dough scoop and bake them on a pizza stone - is absorbs extra butter that oozes out. Also, I only use 4 tsps (1/4 cup) of butter

I am a cook, not a baker, so I thought I better do a half batch just to see if they worked. AMAZING! So easy, I think if I can make them they are foolproof;) Can't wait to make a full batch tomorrow for my Mom's birthday dinner, her favorite restaurant is RL:) My kids are picky eaters and can't wait for me to make more.

A keeper!!  Easy and tasty!!  The only significant change I made was to cut back on the butter.  I used 4 T. in the batter and only 2 T. to brush on after baking.  My biscuits were flatter than I expected, so next time I might try making these in muffin cups.

Very good!  I like these a lot better than the biscuits made from a mix.  The only problem I had with them was too much butter.  Butter was dripping out of them when I took them out of the oven, so I think I will use 4 Tbsp. next time.  A trick I learned from a review of another recipe is to add a pinch of Old Bay seasoning to the butter brushed on top, then they really taste like Red Lobster's!

Delicious! I omitted the butter-and-garlic brush on biscuits, but it was very good, anyhow. I cooked it for approx. 25 min in a 400 degrees stove, like another reviewer suggested. Would make again

I tried this recipe tonight to satsify a cheese craving (gotta love pregnancy) It was wonderful, they tasted fantastic, came out fluffy, and my one year old loved them... the only thing I did differently was to add more baking powder (as per other reviews) and some garlic seasoning to the dry ingredients.  Will be makeing them again for sure...

Outstanding!  I cut the recipe in half (for just me and my hubby) and used twice the amount of baking powder in place of baking soda.  I added a bit of garlic powder and parsley to the batter and skipped the last step of adding the garlic butter.  I also made the batter ahead of time and kept it in the fridge for a few hours.  Rose no problem and were done in 13 minutes.  Delicious.

Althought next time i am going to put parchmet paper or grease my pan because they were extremley hard to get off, even if i did get them of the bottoms were still stuck to the pan. When i made mine i put very cold butter in the batter and was careful not to melt it. The butter melted in the oven and left a light inside. Again Very Good

OH MY GOSH - these were an INSTANT family favorite for all 8 of us. Hubby wasn't home and I litrerally grabbed the last two (from a tripled batch) out of the mouths of two of my children so he could have the experience when he got home.  My changes due to lacking some ingredients and I think I will always do it this way as they were absolutly perfect --  used mozza instead of cheddar.  Instead of minced garlic we used a garlic/herb mix with the melted butter to baste on at the end. It's one that is a premade mix for garlic bread so it is garlic salt - parsley - Parmesan, so it would be easy to whip up from scratch also.   It was amazing. I would absolutly NOT skip the basting of the butter/garlic - I think it's what made them so fantastic!   And - butter. My mother always told me margarine will always work instead but i've really come to believe she was saying this only to save money and it's really not true. Some things - many things - have just got to be butter.

These are very good ( in terms of a simple, base cheddar garlic biscuits ).  These do not taste like the Red Lotbster biscuits ( as claimed by the author ), but they are close.  If you don't have Bisquick ( which seems to be the magic ingredient to all light, airy, buttery biscuits ), add a bit of pancake mix / buttermilk mix to it.  I added some dried parsley to mine, to give it a prettier look.  It's nice to see the bright green flakes in the biscuit as you bite into them.  These are so easy to make...which makes them a keeper in my books.

Pure Heaven! Increase salt and baking powder to 1 tsp. each. I didn't glaze them, they're perfect without it. I also added 1 tsp. of sweet chili seasoning. Amazing!

I'm not exactly sure what many of these reviewers are complaining about. I thought these biscuits were delicious! They are a little on the greasy side, but no more so than the very famous biscuits they are patterned after, if you remember. I did take a few tips from other reviewers though. I killed two birds with one stone. Some complained about the grease, and others said there was not enough salt/flavor, so I added 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt to the mix to add more flavor AND eliminated the last step of adding more butter at the end. They taste very much like the famous RL biscuits. They didn't plump up as much though, so I will probably add some additional baking powder next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not on my list to make again.  I think some measurements need to be revised; they turned out underdone, even after I increased the baking time.  Taste was not up to par, I opted not to eat it after the first two bites.  The topping, on the other hand, was wonderful.  Thank you for letting me try.

These were really good! I added 1 tsp minced garlic to dough and skipped glaze, used 1 tbsp not 1/2 tsp baking powder for fluffier biscuits, also added some Italian seasoning. I got 9 large biscuits, baked at 425 for 14 minutes they were perfect.

this is the first time i've ever made biscuits and these turned out really well...i did mess around with the recipe a bit (added paprika, chili flakes, black pepper and mustard powder, increased the salt and cheese a bit, added baking soda as well as baking powder, added 1 tbs lemon juice to the milk to make buttermilk). i also added a little more than one clove of minced garlic to the batter itself and then another small clove to the melted butter that i brushed on BEFORE baking in a 425 degree oven...the most important tip i found in the reviews was just barely mixing the batter - mine was still floury and falling apart when i dropped it on the cookie sheet and the biscuits were pretty tender. one word of caution: this recipe has enough butter in it so apply the garlic butter sparingly...i just dabbed a bit on each one and it was pretty rich (but really good). definitely making this again.

These biscuits were excellent!  I needed to make something at the last minute, so I thought of these.  I had made the kind with Bisquick before, but I don't have any on hand.  These were actually better than the ones made with Bisquick!  They were more moist and had great flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.

I thought these were incredible, but my husband thought they were just pretty good, but lacked the garlic flavor. I followed the recipe exact except I added 1/2 ts. more baking powder so they would be more fluffy and added a hint of garlic powder to the flour mixture, baked at 425 for about 17 minutes on an airbake baking sheet. They came out perfect despite the lack of garlic flavor, but like one reviewer said, the 1/4 melted butter is way too much for 12 biscuits, try halving the butter. And if you want a true garlic flavor then add some garlic powder to the flour mix.

Used half whole wheat/half regular flour to make them "healthier".  Also used a mexican shredded cheese blend since I had it in the fridge.  Used buttermilk instead of regular milk for tang and added garlic powder and black pepper to the batter instead of on top.  Joked with DH after that we needed to throw the leftovers to the neighbors dogs to keep us from eating the whole batch since I didn't think I could safely hide them in the house.  They were tooooooo good!

Excellent! Like others I used garlic powder, doubled baking powder and 1 1/2 cups cheddar for biscuits. Adding parmesean to garlic butter glaze makes a huge difference. Parchment paper on baking sheet!

These were fantastic! I had to do them in two batches and the first batch came out tasting a little doughy in the middle (even after soaking them in the garlic/butter mixture) So for the second batch I added a dash of garlic powder into the dough and this helped with that, but next time I might actually add a little minced garlic instead to get an even richer flavor. All in all, still 5 stars = amazing

These were GREAT! I was looking for something different to serve with Spaghetti other than just regular garlic bread and these were perfect! Instead of All-Purpose flour, I used self rising and omitted the baking powder and salt and they rose perfectly. I also added 1/2 cup more cheese and instead of adding the whole cup of milk at once, I added a bit at a time until it was just right. Also, I used 3 tablespoons of butter for brushing on instead of the 1/4 cup. These are going to be a regular around here!

I thought this was good. Does taste very similar to red lobster. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the batter. I also used the cheese crumbles so that the cheese was a little thicker. Will definitely make again.

I needed a fast bread for dinner and didn't want plain ol' biscuits.  These were wonderful and everyone loved them.  I did use extra baking powder (1 1/2 teaspoons).  They were crispy where the cheese baked on the outside, soft on the inside and pleasantly garlicky.  I'm sure I'll make these many times.

Really good.. definitely at least double the baking powder.  I made half the dough as directed and they barely rose, but once i added the extra BP it was excellent!  I used fresh grated white extra sharp cheddar (huge cheese fan..).

I am a novice baker and I have to admit that I was ASTOUNDED with the success of these biscuits!  I was a little nervous in trying them, but when I did, I was so happy with the results!  The pros of this recipe :

 - Has a lot of flavour
- Very versatile...you can add any sort of dried herb spice to it to give it a different taste ( I will be using dried parsley and chives next )
- Easy to make

However, I did change a few things :

- I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and upped the baking powder to 3.5 grams to make them fluffier

- I did not use 55 g of melted butter.  This is too much!  I simply melted a small cube of butter and it was enough to coat all of the biscuits...I found that the cheese inside the batter makes them moist anyway, whenever reheated.

- Instead of fresh garlic in the melted butter, I simply used 1 tsp of garlic powder in the batter.  This gives it the kick it needs.

Nevertheless, I`m now enjoying the batch I made tonight with my boyfriend, in front of the tv.  It`s such a pleasure!

I added 1/2 tsp. baking soda as other reviewers suggested.  For the garlic butter, I decreased the amount of butter to 2 tbsp. and used 1/8 tsp garlic powder instead of a clove of garlic.  I've made lots of biscuits in my life and didn't feel like I overmixed these, yet they come out dense and tough as many others have mentioned.  The taste was just okay--it seemed like they needed salt or more garlic or more cheese or something.  I wasn't real impressed.

Yummy...I wanted to make some biscuits last night and was getting ticked off that I couldn't find a recipe that didn't call for biscuit mix, since I didn't have any.  I made an oops by talking to my hubby and dropping in too much butter, but I threw in a little extra flour, milk, etc and they turned out fine.  I agree with other reviews that you don't need as much butter to coat the biscuits...I had lots left over.  My biscuits did stick a little, nothing too bad, I'll just do a little non-stick spray next time.

These are fantastic and do taste quite a bit like the biscuits one would get from that famous seafood restaurant. The next time I make them, I think that I will add the garlic to the biscuit and forgo the garlic butter topping at the end. I would agree that 1/4 cup of butter is a ridiculously large amount of butter for topping 12 biscuits, not to mention a bit of unnecessary fat.

I was a little disappointed in these.  They were okay, not as good as ones I made before with bisquick.  The butter topping is nice with the fresh garlic, but needs salt.  These were flat and the consistency was not flakey like most biscuits.  Good, but not great.

Wow, I really liked these!!! They were at all dense and they were easy to make with the ingredients I had on hand. I'm making them again tomorrow morning. I must say though I changed up the butter glaze that's added. I put some oregano, peppercorn, and a bit more garlic. This time I'm adding parmesan cheese to the mix!

I made these for dinner and they were really nice when served warm.  The only downfall was how dense these biscuits were.  I didn't use the garlic butter on top and they were still nice and moist.  I added some garlic powder and minced garlic to the batter as well as parsley.  Will keep this recipe on hand!

Thia is a terrific recipe! The only thing different I did was to add garlic powder to the dough since I ran out of garlic in clove form.  It was just as good.  I did put butter on top afterward, though.  She is right...they do taste just like the ones at Red Lobster!!

This recipe has potential, but it probably needs more baking powder and less liquid.  They came out pretty flat and dense.

These biscuits were too wet. They needed more flour. When baked they stuck to the pan and were greasey. Recipe needs to be revised.

These were amazing!  I used fat reduced margarine in place of the butter and mixed the minced clove of garlic right into the batter.  I did not brush them with butter when they came out.  My boyfriend did like putting extra margarine on his as he said they were a bit dry without.  I loved them regardless!  Be sure to use sharp or old cheddar cheese!

WOW! These biscuits are rich, luscious, and better than Red Lobster biscuits!  These are a once in awhile treat due to the high butter content, but they will floor you with their taste!  I added some garlic salt in the butter glaze with the real garlic and used less butter.  Great recipe!

These were AWESOME!!! Very similar to Red Lobster's biscuits!! My husband LOVED them, as well as the rest of the family! I didnt taste much garlic from the garlic butter, so I sprinkled Garlic Sprinkle on top of the melted butter. Thanks so much!!

I have tried the other "garlic cheese biscuit" recipes on here that call for baking mix and they are great, but I happened to be out of baking mix, so I tried this recipe. The consistency and taste aren't quite right. The biscuits turned out very heavy and they stuck to the nonstick pan that I used. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used more cheese and such but the biscuits still didn't have the right taste. This recipe falls short.

These are great! I wouldn't go as far as to compare them to Red Blobster's (they aren't nearly as light and fluffy), but they are certainly very tasty. I added a little more cheese, and also some garlic powder to the mix, as well as brushing them with garlic butter. Thanks, Marge!

My entire family loved these! I followed the recipe almost exactly and they turned out great. The only change I made was to not brush garlic butter on the top—I know, it’s an important part of garlic biscuits but some people in the family won’t eat garlic. The biscuits were wonderful even without it, and they would definitely be wonderful with it as well.

I’ve already done a review before and overall, these tasted amazing and were fun to make. I just realized that the reason my biscuits were so flat was because of the flour. I’d suggest using self-rising flour or bread flour instead.

I followed several suggestions of others when making these: doubled Salt, baking powder, 1 1/2 cups of cheese and added garlic powder and pepper. Loved these!!!!  I added garlic Parmesan butter to the warm biscuits. Will definitely make these again in the future.

These were very tasty, but mine did not rise and ended up looking more like cookies than biscuits.  I think I will have to either add less milk or more flour the next time I make them.

I’ve tried a lot of recipes and this is the best AND simplest. I used buttermilk instead of milk and pepper jack cheese. I can see tailoring it with whatever cheese you have on hand.

i made this several times. First few times the biscuits came out flat. I finally came up with the perfect biscuit by... 
1. Using 2 cups of flour
2. Triple the baking powder
3. Add 1 tblsp of lemon juice to    the milk and sit for about 5 mon before adding to the flour mixture.

I give a 3 rating because as written, the recipe yields flat heavy biscuits.

I only used some of the garlic butter on the biscuits, personal preference.

These were pretty standard with every other recipe I’ve tried. I can’t seem to find that perfect Red Lobster one though. If I make it again, I’ll add more flour as my “biscuits” spread a lot, more into a thick pancake.

These are so good! I did make a couple changes to suit our tastes. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the dry ingredients, used garlic powder (all I had at the time) in the melted butter and added parsley flakes.
I had just made some RL cheddar Bay biscuits from the box. We didn't get enough of them so I decided to make these. These were better than branded box version!

I have been making biscuits for years, but  this is the first time the results were this bad. Apparently, the oven temp is way too high, because the biscuits turned out as hard as rocks.

Tasted great! But using an ungreased cookie sheet, NO. Next time I’ll either use parchment paper or my Silpat nonstick sheet! But the top part we could get off, was super. And they’re super easy to make.

I have been making cheese biscuits for years but this was by far the best I’ve ever tasted. They  were so light and flavourable but that may  have had something to do with using milk instead of buttermilk.  Also the  addition of the melted garlic butter  spooned onto the baked biscuit just added another great layer of flavour.   This will definitely become my “go-to” cheese biscuit of choice.

Excellent recipe! I have dairy sensitivities so I used Becel vegan margarine instead of butter, plain soy milk instead of regular milk and goat cheddar cheese. Turned out amazing. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Just a heads up, certain seafood restaurants use buttermilk instead of regular milk. (just the $0.02 from a former line cook at a certain seafood restaurant.) Excellent recipe, though!

How to make biscuit in a culture that do not bake biscuits? First time baking biscuits, I had to throw them away because they were so hard it was embarrassing. More embarrassing when my husband decides to feed the birds with the biscuits no one can eat and the birds wont even touch them. The rain would NOT DISSOLVE THEM. That's is how bad it was...lol. After 5 years of letting it go, I found this recipe and felt this is IT.  Well, this is the best recipes there is. I doubled the salt and the garlic after reading some reviews. I used 2 cups of Bisquick instead of all purposed flour.  After adding all the ingredients, I've noticed the mix was a little bit runny but since we are not used to make biscuit from scratch, I was wondering if anyone will notice. I did it anyways and followed instructions.  I sprayed Pam on my cookie sheet. Secretly, I was hoping they would rise, lol.  They came out tasty, soft and fluffy inside. The shape, hmmm, not so desirable....lol I will cut down the milk the next time and eliminate the garlic powder.  I will give an update on my next adventure making biscuits.

I made this exactly as is. The reason that this did not get 5 stars was that you do not need to add the melted butter after baking. It is way too greasy. 

I made them a second time and here are my changes:  I added a 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp garlic powder (you can used minced garlic if you prefer) and I used a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.  They were very good. The milk I used was skim milk.  I did not add the melted garlic butter at the end.  I baked them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Much easier to remove that way.  I will definitely make again.

I loved these biscuits! I AM  a very avid baker and rarely have bread or biscuits(unless they are home made). I did not brush the tops with melted butter and did double the baking powder. I added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for(maybe 1/4 c. To 1/2 c.) and I used a zester  to grate the clove of garlic into the dough along with 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I used my food processor to cut CUBED FROZEN BUTTER into the dry ingredients until pearled then added the cheese. I was very careful to not touch the dough( which IS sticky) as I wanted the fat to stay as cold as possible(makes for tender biscuits). After mixing the wet ingredients in I refrigerated the biscuit dough for about 2 hours and then scooped them out onto a parchment covered sheet pan. They rose beautifully with perfectly browned tops and crispy edges after baking for about 15-20 minutes in a 425 degree oven. They cleanly and easily came off the parchment  which I reused for multiple batches. I experimented with baking times and temperatures and found that if I baked them first in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes they would cook through but not brown which allowed me to bake them a 2nd time to heat/brown at meal time- perfect for “make ahead baking”! Don’t  worry if the dough seems too wet or sticky! Drop biscuits are generally that way which is an unusual concept for people that are used to cut biscuits which require kneading and are not nearly as sticky as drop biscuits. Wonderful recipe.

I've made these for years now and coming on here to make a note to myself.  

Double the cheese amount.  Put in at least 5 Tbs but can put up to 7 Tbs butter.  More butter means will spread out more.
Use garlic salt.  I use a little less than indicated because my butter has salt.

 Compensate for the additional amounts by having the following for rising:
1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 1 tsp Baking Powder.

Okay to eyeball everything.  Just make sure when cutting butter and mixing in cheese that there is enough spread evenly throughout mix.  That's how to tell the perfect amount.  If some parts have more cheese and others don't then not enough cheese.  Add milk last.  Stir the least amount possible for great tender texture.

These are a huge hit esp. right out of the oven.  I often make two batches in a row!

These were absolutely delicious.  My husband and son thought they were the best.  I can't believe some of you can say these are so good, but then made changes.  Amazing.  If you think a box mix is better, then you don't know how to cook.

I should’ve read the reviews before making this. These biscuits turned out like oily hockey pucks. The were immediately dumped into the trash can. What a waste of good ingredients. Too much butter/milk, not enough baking powder, too high a baking temp perhaps too. Don’t waste your good food on this recipe.

Made this evening for guests. How embarrassing!! I doubled the baking powder. Added more cheddar. Froze  and shred the butter, like the reviews suggested, and what I got were flavorless biscuits that tasted most like flour with a little cheese. I'm super worried about the reviewers that said these tasted like RL... because they taste nothing like them.

I really liked this recipe, it was very simple to make. I didn't have garlic cloves so I just used a tsp of garlic powder.  I would definitely do again!

These were great and easy in the food processor. I added a tsp of parsley and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the flour mix. My husband wanted them to be saltier though so next time I'll add a little more salt.

I made these tonight and with just a couple of changes, followed the recipe as printed.  Didn't have any fresh garlic so I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder, didn't quite need a whole cup of milk, and added some freeze-dried chives (which didn't make a difference).  I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 min. in my oven and they turned out just a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Husband and I both really liked them and I'm sure I will make them again.

Great biscuits. I used garlic spread instead  of butter and chopped up some ham and threw it in there. Turned out great, I was the hero of the day.

Delicious! I made these for a work potluck and they were a big hit. Made them smaller than normal and added an extra handful of cheese. For the garlic, I only had garlic salt. I worried they would be too salty, but turned out perfect.

The overall recipe taste is excellent, but I did have a couple of issues.  It was probably my fault, but I read the recipe as sifted flour, where it should have been measured out first, and then the ingredients sifted together.   I had to add in a fair bit more flour because I thought it meant 1 1/2 cups of sifted flour.    The other issue, is that I believe that the oven temperature should be 25-50 degrees less to get a more even bake.   The bottoms got done before the tops.   I feel the cooler temp would have prevented this.   Nonetheless, a very good recipe.

I added 1 more tsp. Baking powder as I thought 1/2 tsp. Didn't seem like it would be enough. I also used 2 cloves of garlic because I really like garlic. I substituted the milk with evaporated milk As it was what I had at the time. The results were awesome!! I love this recipe!

These turned out a little better then I expected. I added an additional 4 minutes to my bake time as they hadn't browned up as desired. This is probably due to how my oven works, so be careful.

After reading reviews, I doubled the baking powder, added a pinch of baking soda, and used spray butter for the top (which they do not need at all). Due to diet restrictions, I used fat free cheddar cheese and they were outstanding!

I have made the cheese biscuits before however including the garlic gives it an additional dept of flavor.  Instead of adding the garlic to the top I added it to the mix.  I would make these again.

Sooooo good! Followed the advice in the reviews. Full tsp of baking powder. About 1/4 tsp garlic powder. A bit more cheese. A shake of paprika.  I baked for 15 min at the temp directed.

I really wanted to make these with whole wheat  flour, but perhaps next time. Doubled the baking powder, and added garlic powder, parsley and pepper to the dough . I froze my butter for a couple minutes and then grated it on a cheese grater.. This works wonders for any sort of dough where you incorporate cold butter. They cooked up perfectly in 12 minutes. Baked on a sheet with parchment.. No problem with sticking that way and easy clean up. 
I snuck a bite and they are very comparable to the red lobster buns. 
Didn't have a problem using up 1/4 cup of butter on the tops.. They soaked it right up.

SO delicious and a huge hit in our house! I used 1tsp of baking power instead of 1/2 and also used a whole stick of butter instead of 5 tbs for the mixture. Didn't measure the cheese, just added a good amount because my family likes them cheesy. 2 minutes before fully cooked I pulled them out and butter brushed them then put them back for the final 2 minutes and re brushed them in the garlic butter and they were perfect. Crispy on the outside, fluffy and cheesy on the inside. Will definitely make again!

I doubled this recipe. Added dried minced onion, paprika, garlic powder, ground pepper and a little seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I agree whatever portion double the baking powder and throw in a little baking soda. Used swiss cheese and cheddar. They were yummy. Had them with chili.

Delicious! After being shocked by the small amount of baking powder in the recipe and reading a handful of reviews, I doubled the baking powder and am glad I did. Next time I'll add another 1/4 teaspoon of salt and add minced garlic to the batter.

This recipe was amazing! Don't listen to the people who say the biscuits didn't come out right. They just don't know how to bake. I'm only 13, and this recipe was so easy to make. i used garlic butter for the topping, and it worked just as well. I'm definitely going to make these again.

Next time I make this, I will use a food processor to mix the milk into the flour and cheddar mixture, as it's quite crumbly and that's one way to get it mixed evenly without toughening the dough by over handling. As it was, it was hard to roll, and I was convinced I'd messed them up, but the cheese seems to have bound them during baking and they weren't crumbly after all. 

I mixed 3 cloves of minced garlic into the dough,  and then used another three in place of the garlic salt in the butter topping. Super garlic, but in a great way!  

The best accompaniment to a great bowl of Beef and Guinness. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/234534/beef-and-guinness-stew/#recipe-toolbar

I suggest a few alternatives to the recipe. Use buttermilk (best option) or if you are counting calories skim milk . I also use 3 to 4 cloves of garlic and added 4 chopped scallions (green onion) or 1/2 medium white onion.  I suggest playing with the cheese as well. Perhaps different blends of cheddar (mild, med and sharp), Italian cheeses (parmesan, romano reggiano, provolone) and if you like a kick to it asiago or pepper jack. Adding jalapeno peppers to the cheddar is another way to go.

Delicious. I prefer them to RL. Theirs are way too greasy and salty for me. I only used about 1.5 TB melted butter with some garlic powder on top. Per suggestion I added a a pinch of baking soda and some garlic powder to the dry ingredients. These disappeared quickly.

I used 2 tsp baking powder.  I spread all the dough out into a circle on parchment paper, brushed with the garlic butter before baking and baked it for 15 min.  It turned out beautifully crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  Cut in wedges and serve hot lightly buttered with remaining garlic butter. Delicious!!!!

Tasty  biscuits.  I would add garlic powder to the mix or brush the biscuits with garlic butter before and after baking.

I followed this recipe exactly.  Made these biscuits tonight.  Don't get me wrong, they tasted great, but they were a very odd texture for a biscuit, nice and crispy on the outside (mainly the bottom) but kind of rubbery and gummy on the inside.  Never had a biscuit quite like these.  Also, they stuck so bad to the cookie sheet that I broke one of my plastic spatulas trying to get them unstuck.

These turned out a bit odd. They tasted good, but were like greasy scones. I think the recipe needs a lot more baking powder. The comparable recipe in Betty Crocker calls for three teaspoons of baking powder, so I would suggest adding more if you make this recipe.

Love these! I've made them several times. I prefer this recipe because it doesn't have a mix in it (like bisquick).  I follow the recipe exactly except one deviation. I add garlic powder to the batter as well.  I felt it needed a little more garlic favour and love having it throughout the biscuit. 1 batch makes about 10-12 biscuits. I would recommend doubling the recipe. These are delicious and people will want more than one!

Glad I made a double batch. I slivered the butter so it melted while baking for 19 minutes, deep-frying the bottom of the biscuits. I then used this butter to baste the tops.

Delish! Made these the other day and I wished I had made a bigger batch. Tonight I'm making a double batch. And I put some garlic powder in with the flour because I like garlic and having it on the outside is just not enough.

I just made these today.   I doubled the baking soda and clearly its a must.  I increased the amount of cheese and that worked well.   I added garlic salt to the dough but I think that made to too strong.  I found them very very greasy so I would decrease the butter next time and see what happens.

Mine sure didn't turn out as nice as the photos. I have never made biscuits before. My hey seemed a bit doughy and turned out the same in the end.  They stuck to my pan too.  Maybe more flour next time??

lovely, quick and easy recipe! Taste great, will definitely use this recipe again. I made mine slightly larger so they resembled dumplings rather than biscuits and they were fantastic. Could mix up ingredients and use spiced cheese or add herbs and use them in a variety of ways - very versatile recipe!

I've made this twice, just as it's written, and they're delicious. I'm making more tonight to go along with the chili I'm cooking. I was amazed at how easy it was to make biscuits. I had to go through 9 recipes until I found one that didn't start with "2 cups of Bisquick or biscuit mix." Why would anyone use a mix when these are so easy and so delicious?

I had been looking for these biscuits without using baking mix, this recipe fit the bill. I felt they were lacking salt. I used a mexican cheese mix and didn't feel the cheese was strong enough.  Next time i would double baling powder and add garlic salt.

Delicious! I had a couple of dashes of garlic powder to the batter. Will keep using this recipe. Very easy to make.

I love that this recipe doesn't use a baking mix.  I used freshly shredded vermont extra sharp white cheddar.  Results were amazing!  It did take more like 15-20 minutes to bake.  Next time I would probably decrease the oven temp to something like 400.  I also sprinkled with paprika and parsley for color.

Wow, I couldn't possibly be more pleased! I was looking for any kind of cheesy biscuit recipe that didn't call for "baking mix" and this exceeded my expectations by a long shot, and my guests and family raved about them. I followed the recipe precisely and was careful not to over stir, and the biscuits puffed up perfectly and tasted increble. This recipe is finding a safe, permanent home in our family recipe book. Thank you so much for the excellent recipe!

They turned out great and my guests loved them. I should have made two batches. I did use double the baking powder as others suggested so I would recommend doing so.

Update: Made these again with the garlic butter and man did it really top off a great recipe! I also used almond milk instead of regular because it is all I had. It didn't seem to effect the taste or texture. Just delightful!

This recipe was just alright. I will try them again but I will do things really differently. This recipe needs more salt, period. 1/4 cup of butter at the end was WAY too much...they ended up tasting mostly of butter. Remember that the cheese will add fat too. Also, next time I will add garlic powder to the dry ingredients to make the garlic flavor go through the whole biscuit.

Still works a treat! I do modify it by using a bit more cheese and add garlic powder into the dry ingredients. (I love garlic so I add close to a tablespoon).

After making these multiple times, we've decided the raw garlic on top is a little overpowering. We like these better if we skip that and just mix 1/2 t of garlic powder with the other dry ingredients. I also substitute white whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the all purpose flour, and everyone still likes the biscuits. I could probably substitute more but haven't tried it yet.

This is a keeper. Along with the recipe i used sharp cheddar, also added a little season salt, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning while mixing up the dough after the cheddar goes in. The rolls really soak up the garlic butter nicely right after you take them out of the oven. I also put the dough in a greased muffin tin instead of a cookie sheet.

I made these, and they were indeed very easy! Not too bad but I found them to be kind of dry and under baked in the centre. Bland as well. I'll try making them with a couple of changes suggested by other users (more baking soda, lower temperature in oven etc) and see if it helps.

Closest to the famous restaurant biscuits that I have ever made! As other reviewers mentioned, I increased the baking powder and cheese. My DH said they are cheesier than the famous biscuits, probably due to the extra cheese! Will definitely make these again.

I am IN LOVE with these. Serious! I made these for my husband and myself so I cut the recipe in half and kept just about the same amount of cheese (we love our cheese:) Only suggestion - MAKE SURE you either grease the pan or if you bake them on aluminum foil for easy clean up - make sure you allow them about 5+ minutes to cool otherwise they will stick and you'll have more than cheesy biscuits for dinner!

I Doubled up on the baking powder,salt and  added about 2 cups of cheese  baked them for 16 min and they turned out great! I was worried When I read a review saying they were heavy and dense but mine turned out light and fluffy. Also instead of putting melted butter on top I made some garlic butter on the side so everyone could put as little or as much on as they liked. They were a hit with the fam :)

These biscuits are so good. And we thought that they tasted like RL.They came out light, fluffy and delicious. To the batter I did add garlic powder and lightly mixed. I should have made a double batch. Thanks Marge for this great recipe.

Loved it! Very much like the Big Boys biscuits that I do love so much. Quick and easy. Will add a bit more salt next time but I'm not sure if I added enough to begin with since I eyeballed the measurements. Great recipe!!

Great recipe , made some changes!  Added garlic powder to dough and some extra salt.  As other reviews have said, grease the pan.  Tried on ungreased and they stuck. :(.  Worked fine when I sprayed Pam on the cookie sheet.

They tasted great.  I used buttermilk instead of milk for a good tang taste.  I also placed the mix in the refrigerator after cutting in the butter so that the butter would stay solid.  Got great results.

Made these tonight with fish chowder...made them into mini muffin sizes...a whole pan is already gone! I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (if you are leery to this add less! we LOVE our garlic) and 1/2 tsp or so of parsley to the dry mix and only a pinch of salt. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used fresh grated Parmesan. When they were done cooking I brushed them with melted butter mixed with garlic salt. Love the basis of this biscuit recipe. I will forever remember this, and try more flavor options! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

These biscuits tasted just like the ones from the restaurant! Amazing! One thing that went bad was the bottom of some of them were getting burned.

I made this t go with a slow cooker chicken and potato recipe! We love garlic cheese biscuits. I screwed it up, mixed the flour and milk, and then put the butter in last. The result was that there were pockets of butter that caramelized with the cheese on the bottom, giving it a golden, delicious crunch! I doubled the recipe, used half to sandwiches (threw on some sliced deli ham) and the other half for dinner. They are DELICIOUS.

An easy, basic recipe. A little bland, so I would suggest some garlic powder, or other seasonings.

My little nephew couldn't get enough of these biscuits! I doubled the salt & baking as suggested by others, and added a bit more cheese just because ;) and absolutely loved how they turned out. Thanks for sharing :)

I made these for Fathers Day Dinner and the only problem I had was that there was not enough, I did substitute garlic salt for the minced onion, but they were great and everyone loved them.

I made these tonight and used fresh ground spelt flour, in place of the white flour.  When working with spelt, the liquid amounts are never exact, so I added until the dough clung together, and it was a bit sticky.  (If you use spelt, you will know this)  Absolutely amazing biscuits!!  (I also doubled the baking powder)Very comparable to Red lobsters biscuits.  I highly recommend them!  And I am so glad I doubled the recipe!!

Awesome recipe!! The only change I made was to 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda. I've found that it really makes the biscuits super fluffy!!

These are very delicious! Ive made them twice now. Once following the recipe to the tee and the other added a lot of what the reviews said. I definitely will be making these again. My husband loves the RL biscuits and now we can have something very similar at home. My revised recipe: 1)spray your pan, they stick very bad if you dont 2)I added a little more flour(1/8c)a half a tbs(on accident)butter 3)doubled the salt and baking powder and added a few dashes of baking soda 4)added about 1/2 to 1 tsp of garlic salt(I didnt have powder)to the flour mixture 5)the temp was a little too high....i turned it down twice so next time will try it at about 415 degrees instead of 450. Also I will be making my biscuits a little smaller than what they came out. It made 12 but they were a bit big. oh also i added a bit of parsley to the butter mixture and brushed it on! The reason I gave this a few is because it needs doctoring for us. If you dont like a lot of garlic then you should try the original recipe.

I made these for lunch. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used mozarella and parmesan. They turned out okay. I didn't sift the flour like it called cause I forgot. It could use a touch of sweetness but that's just me. Other than that, they are pretty good.

This was so delicious and easy to make!!! I did add a little garlic powder as one person suggested and that made this recipe really pop. I also was out of cheddar so I used shredded Mexican taco cheese and it was so good!

I could see these would be a tad bland so I added extra baking powder, seasonings, green onions, chopped up some fresh rosemary and extra cheese.  With these additions these biscuits are now off the charts great!  My husband can't get enough of them.  I'm making a second batch now as he gobbles them up.  Highly recommend adding some kind of fresh herbs as it really brings these to life.

Tossed in some dried rosemary, thyme and parsley for a bit of an herb kick - a few sprinkles of garlic powder and skipped the butter/ garlic brush on - (more for my gut - I'm sure it tastes awesome)! Turned out fantastic!! And I am far from any kind of "baker"! Thanks!

I think these did not turn out as well as they should have...  I have a feeling it was due to me trying to prepare dinner while holding a fussy 6-month old all while my two year old probably altered the recipe somehow.  However, I have a feeling these would have been outstanding if I was able to concentrate!  I'll have to try these again in the near future!

The taste was there, but they didn't have quite the texture I was looking for.  They weren't quite as soft and flakey as I wanted.  They still tasted great, though.

Hmm not too impressed. I made these exactly like the recipe directed(except for putting garlic salt in the batter), NOT overmixing, and they were not very fluffy and didn't rise very well. I would try this recipe again, but fiddle with the flour/leavening ingredients a little. Or maybe use shortening...

Amazing recipe!  I modified it a little bit and added:
1/4 cup of sugar
1 pkg. hidden valley ranch powder mix

Tastes just like Red Lobsters.

These were good!  Added 1 teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of baking soda as recommended by previous expert cooks/reviewers.  Also used extra sharp Cracker Barrel cheese & buttermilk.

Was so excited to find this recipe. Made them for our company and they turned out...well...nothing like I was expecting. I followed the recipe to the "T" and they came out hard and greasy. Sorry, but this recipe wasnt for me.

Very quick and easy.  I subbed pizza cheese since I was pairing them with italian food.  Also added a dash of garlic powder and italian seasonings to the batter.  I made about 7 large biscuits.  Didn't even need the extra butter after baking.

Did not rise enough; my bread remained soggy and undercooked although I cooked it for more time than specified. Probably need more baking powder. They are completely bland, there's no seasoning at all in the recipe except for the salt, which I found inadequate. I had to heavily season the garlic butter to get a little flavor. I'll stick to garlic bread.

I usually stay away from baking any kind of pastries or breads other than cookies because I'm just.....not good at it. But when I saw this recipe I just had to try it due to the constant raving I hear all the time about this particular restaurant's  biscuits.  I've never tasted biscuits from that famous sea food restaurant before but these were delish!  The only changes I made was added a little garlic powder to the butter mixture but that's just a personal preference for more of a garlic taste. (You might want to save yourself some butter and half the amount of it [in the butter mixture] because a quarter cup is way too much) Also I think 450 is waay too much of a temp for these. I had mine on 400 (Due to that being the max temp that a silpat is said to be able to take) and I'm glad I did because they turned out perfectly at this temperature after 15 minutes of baking and I can't imagine that it would turn out anything but burnt on the outside if it were cooked at 450 for any amount of time. I also added maybe about a half a cup of more cheese and used a "fiesta" blend instead of cheddar.

You cant mess theese up unless you over mix them! I've made them with all different ingredients and they still come out perfect! From sweet to savory doesn't matter! Try em you'll love em. Thanks again.

Omg, these are the BEST biscuits! So good, so cheesy and soft and fluffy. I added a few shakes of garlic powder to the dough, and baked at 400 for 18 mins instead of 450 for 12 - 15 and they were absolutely perfect! All the cheese on the inside melted and everything. I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could! :) Thanks!

These were AWESOME! I made a batch to serve with pasta (something different from regular garlic bread) and they were gone in minutes with a lot of "mmmm..these are so great" thrown inbetween the snarfing!  Thank you for sharing! I didn't change a thing and they were perfect!

I should have doubled the recipe!  I made the biscuits as directed, almost.  I had nacho cheddar cheese, so used that. And like others suggested I didn't need nearly that much melted butter.

I've never visited the certain restaurant these are served at but these biscuits are amazing!  I just made my first batch and I think I'm going to make a quadruple batch next time so I can freeze the rest!  Thanks for this delicious (AND easy!) recipe!

i'm sorry but these biscuits are certainly not my favorite recipe. They were way to greasy and they did not rise at all. It wasn't my baking soda either, I just bought a new can. I even put them in the muffin tins as a reader suggested. I like this idea.

These are fantastic, simple, and yes, they really do taste like Red Lobster! Just make sure and remember to brush the garlic butter over the top once they are done, it really makes all the difference.

These were pretty good, but I think I was expecting better. The recipe was simple, and easy to follow, but it felt like something was missing from the flavour. I think my biggest issue was how greasy the biscuits were after brushing with the butter and garlic. Not sure if I will make again, but happy I tried it!

Got the "thumbs up" for these from my family. I followed the recipe as written, but I baked them in a muffin tin. I would spray or lightly grease the tin next time, because they stuck a bit.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing! The only thing different I did was instead of making the melted garlic butter I cheated and bought a tub of Land O Lakes Garlic butter and melted it to brush on top of the baked biscuits. They were still a hit!

Very nice biscuits.  I'd like the garlic flavor to be more pronounced and I think a couple of things would easily fix that.  Instead of using minced garlic for the butter wash, make a garlic paste--the flavor would be stronger that way.  Also, add minced garlic to the mix itself.  I added garlic powder but it still wasn't enough for me.  I also used about 1/2 the butter--all of it would have been wasted I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read some other ratings, and decided to turn down the heat to 435 and bake 14-15 min. They came out great! Also instead of chopped garlic, I crushed 3 garlic cloves and melted it with the butter, I removed the garlic, and painted on the butter (to avoid chunks of garlic) I would say these get a 4 1/2 star rating...They are very tasty! Thanks=)

My mother-in-law gets excited about visiting us just because I always make these. I triple the garlic and put most of it inside the biscuits. Also, I replace about 1/3 of the butter with lard.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Love it when I don't have to go to the grocery store to make something yummy!  I did add a pinch of baking soda and garlic powder as suggested.  Baked on an air bake cookie sheet and had no sticking problems.  Awesome!  Thanks!

I made these but changed a couple of things.. they came out absolutely amazing! instead of the 1/2 Teaspoon of baking powder, I used 1/2 baking SODA and 1/2 of cornstarch. I also added oregano into the mixture (add to your liking). I also added 3 tsp of garlic poweder.. all me and my family could say was YUM!!

These were really good and fast to make. I was worried that 1/2 tsp baking powder wasn't enough, so I used 1 tsp. I was too lazy to do the garlic butter on top, so I added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the flour. I will make these again.

These rock!  I made these tonight and they were very good and buttery.  I made a few changes but nothing that changed the whole recipe.  I increased baking powder and salt to 1 tsp per other reviews and added a few dashes of garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  I used garlic powder on top rather than chopped garlic.  These were really good.

These were awesome. Had great flavor I didnt use all the butter to brush them with but thats okay. I did not have a problem with them being dense but of course this is a biscuit dough and you have to be really careful about how you handle it or you will make them dense.

These had a great flavor. I used sharp and white cheddar and added a bit of powered garlic to the dry ingredients.

I thought these were fantastic.  I added garlic to the dough itself, and a bit more in the butter.  I also added more baking powder and a dash of baking soda.  I fed three hungry men and had to make a triple batch because they were inhaling them as quickly as I could get them off the pan!!  Definitely best when HOT.  Great recipe!!

the biscuits lacked flavor so i added 1 tsp garlic powder in the flour mix because I don't like to bit into actual pieces of the clove and I mixed the cheese...farmers and mozzarella (because of the blood type diet)...also i added 1/2 extra cheese.  also I added 1/2 tsp baking powder to make it a little bit more fluffy.

My family enjoys these very much. The first batch was over done on the bottom so I adjusted to 425 degrees with perfect results. I also add garlic powder to the flour, about 1 tsp, for added flavor.

I used half of this recipe. I have been experimenting with just a base biscuit recipe. For plain biscuits this is the best recipe I have tried and super easy! Next time I will add the cheese and garlic. mmmm!!!

I loved these little biscuits enough to give them a "6", but I did make some changes, so I guess I'll have to go with a 4 or so...  I used whole wheat flour to appease my conscience a little (because that makes them health-food, right..?), and in stead of brushing them with the garlic butter mixture, I just added garlic to the batter.  These little babies were plenty buttery that way for me.  I also used a little more cheese than was called for, and used sharp cheddar.  I've gotta tell you - THEY ROCKED!!  I could have eaten 10 - but reigned myself in at about 6.  A real study in self-control, right..?  I challenge you to do the same!  Good luck, and enjoy!

I don't know what happened with these, but the texture was gummy and crusty and not what I am used to. I wanted to find a recipe to make without Bisquick mix, but I'm going back to "Garlic Cheese Biscuits" on this site, they are much better.

These are good, not great but good. They do have a similar taste to the ones served at RL but they arent as light and fluffy. I'll probably try this recipe again and just do a little experimenting.

These are fantastic and so easy to prepare! Very tasty! Mine looked a little more like tall cookies than drop biscuits - they flattened somewhat when cooking, but that defiitely did not affect the taste at all! Very Good!!!

Delicious!  Very much like seafood restaurant biscuits. I added fresh grated parmesan, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and garlic powder to dry mix.  Used 1 & 1/2 cups cheddar, and they were wonderful.  I live at high altitude so had no problems with watery biscuits using the whole cup of milk.  Great recipe!

I never have buttermilk, sour cream or shortening on hand, so this is a great recipe that doesn't use those items.  My family loved these!  I poured in the milk a little at a time until the batter looked right to me, so I used slightly less milk.  I like a slightly drier dough so the biscuits don't spread and flatten while baking.  The garlic butter brushed on the top was perfect!

These are Aaaaaaaaaawsome! I made these tonight for supper and my son just loved them. He said they are just like cheesy bread but smaller. That's the only thing we can compare, only because we never ate at RL because my husband does not like sea food. This is a keeper. I halved the recipe but next time I think I will make the whole recipe. I think I will agree with one of the other reviewers and not use as much butter and garlic, I will only use halve of what it calls for. That's the only thing I would do different.

excellent. I didn't have minced garlic so I added garlic powder to the mix instead and the butter sauce. I added approx. 1/2 teaspoon but I will add a little more next time. I guess it is all up to personal tatste if you want alot of garlic or a little. Very easy to make. This is a keeper.

Pretty good!  These made 12 biscuits.  I used 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, powdered garlic (1 tsp into the dry ingredients), mexican style cheeses, and no salt (bf is on a low-sodium diet). For the top, I only used maybe 2 Tbsp. butter w/lots of powdered garlic on top.  They tasted good, but I feel like they were missing something that the Red Lobster biscuits had...maybe its the salt?

Great! I'll probably give these five stars next time I make these...my first attempt made me realize I needed to tweak the recipe a little more. As for this time, I added a little bit of garlic powder, and used a garlicky-salted blend seasoning I bought from a local spice maker.  I also added a little bit of onion powder and a TAD of seasoning salt. I think it may need even more garlic and salt. I want to try them with Old Bay, too. But they turned out great! I will make these again -- they are so easy!

These biscuits are fantastic!  I used buttermilk because that's all I had and veg shortening instead of butter in the batter.  I misread the instructions and ended up adding garlic to the batter and then again to the melted butter brushed over top.  Good thing we like garlic at our house.  They came out wonderful and fluffy!

VERY GOOD!  the recipe either uses too much milk or not enough flour...when all mixed together, it was way too watery.  i added more flour until it was the right consistency and they cooked perfectly!  just like the restaurant...the garlic butter at the end is what makes them!  if it didn't have that, they'd be bland!  but with it...wow...will make again!

These biscuits were ok.  They were bland.  This might be because I didn't put the butter and minced garlic on top (I didn't think my kids would like that).  I did put garlic powder in the biscuits though.  I couldn't really taste the cheese and I used sharp chedder.

Oh my goodness, these were so good!
I added about one cup of extra cheese, so they were a little greasy, but still delicious! It ended up making 20-25 small biscuits.

I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit disappointed.  My biscuits turned out flat, too greasy, and they need a little more flavor (maybe extra salt?)  These look more like pancakes than biscuits.  They taste fairly decent, but nowhere near as good as the restaurant biscuit this supposedly copies.

Great recipe! Foolproof and quick to whip up, even freeze well! I couldn't help adding extra cheese and the dough still came out fine. Didn't bother brushing the tops, just added a pinch each of onion and garlic powder to the dry ingredients and put a pat of butter on top when they were done.

These have the potential to be very good, but are just a little lacking in flavor as is.  After reading some reviews, I was a little nervous to make them, but stuck to the recipe, adding only a touch more baking powder (hoping to help them rise a bit more than others).  I was really excited to see how they turned out - they looked great to me.  But, the taste was not great.  In my opinion, they definitely needed more salt.  I salvaged the taste a bit by sprinkling them with garlic salt, and it was amazing how much a little bit of salt changed the flavor!  I might make these again with changes, or maybe just try a different recipe.

Melt in your mouth good. I added grated romano cheese and crushed parsley. These are the only biscuits that I can cook without ruining. So simple, quick and easy is why it is a 5 for me! Try this recipe--you'll be glad you did

These were amazing! I left out the final process of butter/garlic. I used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt instead of the reg. salt.
So good and extremely easy! Will make again for sure!

These were pretty good!  I skipped adding the garlic butter to the top and I just added the minced garlic and a little garlic powder to the mix.

These were good, but next time I will use more garlic and add some parsley. This recipe is incredibly easy and, after some tweaking, will become a staple at my house.

Absolutely great!  I made spaghetti and realized I didn't have any garlic bread.  This recipe did the trick and my husband and son decided that they want these biscuits instead of garlic bread from now on!

I give these 5 stars on behalf of my husband. He thought they were excellent. I thought they were good, maybe 4 stars. I added some garlic powder and dill weed to the mix. 

These are much better than the one you make with bisquick. Not nearly as dry.

I've made this twice exactly as per directions and my girlfriend and I can't get enough. These go great with pasta dinners. I'm already getting requests from friends and family to make them some whenever I talk about these.

These are really easy and really tasty.   The consistency is a lot like RL. The only thing is they did stick to the pan so I am trying a batch right now on a greased pan. I am going to try other cheese-spice combos in the future. Thanks for this recipe!

Pretty good! They do have a tendency to be a bit greasy when fresh and dry when left out for a few days but if you're making these expecting they'll all be eaten the day you make them, they are perfect and quick!

GREAT!!!! I too added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and used buttermilk instead of regular milk, I used a little extra cheese a little over a cup but not as much as others. I also put grated parmesan in the flour mixture. I let them sit for about 40 minutes before seperating into spoonfuls I am not a baker per se so I don't know if that helped or not but they were not as dense and were kind of smooth and fluffy.  They tasted better than slightly better than the seafood places' and were pretty easy to make.

It tasted really good but like some of the other reviewers I found them too dense. I wanted light and fluffy but instead got gooey and doughy.

This literally was the best thing i have ever eaten in my life!! it was just the perfect combination of crisp on the outside as well as moist and buttery on the inside. I used 3 cheeses for this recipe; parmesean, cheddar as well as mozzerella just to give it a more cheesy flavour. I will definiatly make these again!!!

I love that these required no mix, and I love how quick and easy they were.  The texture was nice (I added an extra teaspoon of baking powder, 1.5 in total to avoid the dense biscuits other reviewers complained of.)  They were kinda bland, though, the garlic was subtle, maybe next time I'll add a sprinkle of cayenne, and chives? or parsley? to the dough.  For those that want prettier biscuits, leave them out on the cookie sheet for a bit before cooking.  I made mine in 2 batches, and the second batch, which sat while the 1st cooked, are much smoother on top, much prettier.  Oh, and I used 50/50 whole wheat and white flour, and that worked well.  Overall yummy, quick and easy.  What more can you ask for?

These were excellent!  I love the fact that no mix was needed....perfect as written.  Only change I made was not using 1/4 cup of melted butter to brush on....I just used the rest of the stick after making the biscuits, so 3 TBS.  My family devoured these....not one was left!

This recipe was excellent! The whole family loved them. In fact, they are requested every time I do any Italian now. There was only one thing that I had changed. (Not really relizing it.) I was in a hurry and only had garlic powder. I rushed the reading of the recipe and ended up adding the garlic to the bread dough. Still turned out excellent! Thanks so much for the recipe!

My kids LOVED these biscuits and they don't eat anything.  I thought they were a little flat, but very tasty.  I added extra cheese and while they were cooking I added 3 cloves of garlic and a touch of salt to melted butter and let it sit so it had a really good flavor when brushed on.  Mine didn't stick at all, but I did spray my sheet with a cooking spray before baking.

These are the best freaking things i've ever eaten!  OMG I just LOVE these.  They are perfect to me.  Everyone says they are WAY better than the Red Lobster ones.  These are moist and dense whereas the RL ones are light and more like a KFC biscuit. I love their heaviness, the slight crunch on the bottom from the melted cheese, and the garlic on top.  I would use a brush next time that delivers less butter per biscuit, as my brush overbuttered I think. You can reduce the amount of melted butter needed at the end and it will be fine.

make these often-simple easy and delicious! Sometimes i add the garlic right into the buscuits, rather than brushing them with garlic and even more butter at the end...good either way!

The biscuits tasted great but they're not worth making. I cut my thumb just trying to get them off the baking sheet. Also, they're way too buttery; the additional butter topping isn't neccessary.

These tasted delicious, but the texture didn't come out at all.  I jokingly called them cheese pancakes because they were so flat.  I was amazed that they stuck to the pan, since they sizzled in pools of butter while they were in the oven.  Not sure if I did something wrong or if they were meant to turn out this way.  Maybe I'll give them another try to see if I made a mistake...

These biscuits were delicious. I used a combo of mozzarella and parmesan because that's the only cheese I had on hand. I ate them with spaghetti. Yum! Yum!

These came out a little flat and they were a little milky tasting, but the flavor with the garlic was nice.

Husband loved these and thought that he could almost eat those exclusively for a meal...I thought they were a little heavy and would have liked them to be a little fluffier.  Still thought they were good though!!!  *****Added thought...I used a baking stone and had absolutely no problem at all with "stickage".******

I needed something to fill out my dinner and decided on biscuits, even though I personally don't like them. I made them and added some garlic salt to the mix. Once I tried a bite of one, I was hooked. I've made them 3 times in one week and between only me and my boyfriend, they're always gone in just one day. These are EXCELLENT!

These biscuits are excellent!  I didn't stray from the recipe one bit.  I've never had Red Lobster's so I don't know how they compare, but I loved these.

Made these last night, and I can't stop thinking about them today!  Can't wait to go home and have leftovers.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out perfectly.
