I was looking for something to make for the teachers and staff at my son's high school.  I double the recipe.  It's really pretty easy to make, and is so delicate and pretty.  No fork or plate is needed, so it's good for parties.  One note:  Dickinson's Lemon Curd at my two local grocery stores was $4.50/jar.  Both Target and Walmart had it for $2+.  Big difference.  My grocery store won't price match, but they did knock down the price a little. Tips: 1)I used a piping bag for cool whip/lemon curd, and for the dab on lemon curd on the top. A zip lock will work, too, as they mention. 2) Make sure you cool in the pan for 3 mins as instructed or they could fall apart because they are so light and fluffy.
