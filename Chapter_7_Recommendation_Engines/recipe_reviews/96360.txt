Not bad.  I made these for a tupperware party and they went. It took awhile to make though.  If I make these again-I would use a blender to crush the chips. some of the meatballs fell apart.the sauce was great

Everyone in my house absolutley loved this recipe.I decided to grate the onion instead of chop and the same with the garlic clove for the flavor without the chunks also added about half teaspoon paprika instead of chili powder and used flavored cilantro lime tortilla chips instead of regular you could also use blue or red tortilla chips for color.I also added half teaspoon sea salt and half teaspoon of pepper.Only complaint is that only one side got caramelized so i thought I would grease and place another sheet pan on top too so top and bottom have the same nice yummy crust.

Update: 9-9-2007 I made this again with a pound of ground pork plus one egg, one shallot chopped, one garlic clove chopped, the bread crumbs, and spices (plus a litle seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder) I added about a tsp of browning sauce to flavor the pork as well. I crushed up two hand  fulls of tortilla chips and added this to the inside of the mix.  Instead of baking I browned the balls in a pan with only cooking spray for lubrication. I made them about half the size of a golf ball almost.   2-28-2007This is like a 3.5-4. I think I might make something similar again but I'm not sure. Tasted good but we weren't fighting over them. I'm had made a sauce using milk, wine, ground mustard, garlic powder and processed cheese for some crusty bread for something else and we used that to top some of the balls. I think I might prefer without the cruchy outside. I made way too much dipping sauce since I was the only one who ate it. Added 1.5 tsp of minced chili pepper for some kick. Wished I had minced the onions in the food processor way too big at finely chopped.

I didn't have any turkey, so I used beef.  My boyfriend thought that these were quite good, but that the sauce was an absolute must.  (I'm a veg., so I didn't partake.)

I made these a couple of years ago, and while we liked the flavor, the texture was rather off-putting. I had another go tonight with ground sirloin, and we enjoyed them a lot more. They were a little bit on the dry side but the dipping sauce took care of that. I used Spicy Nacho flavored Doritos, which added a nice little kick. Thanks!

Very good and easy to make.  I made a pan full of meatballs with the recipie.  The dip was easy and tastey.  Probably would add something to the meatballs to make them a little more spicey.
