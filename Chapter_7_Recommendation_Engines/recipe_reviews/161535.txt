Wow! This was terrific. I used a bag of fresh spinach and cooked the onion and garlic first, then added the garbanzo beans and cooked them with, mashing them a bit, then added the fresh spinach and wilted it with salt and cumin. I served it with baked lemon salmon and it was divine!! Thanks for the recipe.

Spinach, garbanzo beans, garlic, olive oil - all flavors I grew up up with and love. Cumin is relatively new to me, but I love it too. I thought I'd have a winner here with this recipe, but I've learned that just because you love a variety of flavors doesn't mean they all belong together.  For me, this was just perfect and excellent until the addition of the cumin, which just didn't seem to work well with the spinach.  I found the cumin and spinach an "off" combination.  I used fresh baby spinach so I didn't have any problem with the dryness other reviewers noted, but I can easily see where this would be an issue with frozen spinach.  Oh, I know I'll make this again, because dishes like this are so familiar and just the way I grew up learning to eat and to cook - but I'll reserve the cumin for another time, in a different dish.

This is a good basic recipe when you don't have a lot of time or if you're too tired want to cook. I usually don't use the cumin and substitute it for rosemary. When I have them on hand, I will add canned diced tomatoes and even adding a splash of red wine brings a lot of depth and flavor to this recipe. Simple ingredients and cooking at its best!

This is a very traditional Spanish dish or tapas, I grew up on this and is the ONLY way I would eat my spinach! This recipe is fine BUT it is missing a very important ingredient, Sweet Spanish Paprika, just use regular if thats what you have, also white wine, some add coriander and some recipes use bread in it but honestly it is already so hearty that I feel it works best without the bread. Cumin goes perfectly with this dish contrary to the other review and please please don't destroy this wonderful dish by adding cheese!!!

My husband I LOVE this and make it all the time! I do make a few changes though... After sautéing the garlic and onion, I add the beans and mash most of them with a fork (this tastes better if most of the beans are mashed). Then I add chopped fresh spinach in batches, covering with a lid after each addition until wilted. Once all the spinach has been added, I season with cumin, salt (1/4 tsp is plenty), and a little red pepper. I cook the mixture covered for about 5 more minutes, stirring every minute or so. DELICIOUS!

OMG!!! This is a FANTASTIC and easy recipe! I used fresh spinach as I prefer fresh over frozen and I did not mush the garbanzos as I like mine whole. I followed the recipe to a "T" and did make any additions or ommissions, was done in less time than it took to grill my salmon that accompanied it! Awesome Recipe!

This was easy to make and tasted fantastic!  I doubled it and added a cup of water and a chicken bullion cube for a little extra juiciness.

WOW. First off I will say that I not by any means a spinach lover unless it is covered in some kind of cheese, but this recipe was fantastic. The only thing I changed was a little extra garlic, and some chicken broth at the end of cooking because it started to get very dry. Next time I will mash the beans before I put them in the pan and add a little ground black pepper/. Overall great recipe, will definatly make a regular dish, even the kids liked it.

i've made this a couple of times now, and as much as i love cumin, i feel it is a little too earthy and didn't work well for me in this dish. i must have squeezed the spinach too much in an effort to "drain well," as it was very dry. after tasting it, i added some lemon pepper and feta cheese and i liked it much more. i prefer using the whole onion, fresh lemon zest and a pinch of cayenne.  a squeeze of fresh lemon at the end also really brightens this dish. great recipe to tweak to your tastes, and feel healthy doing it. :)

Very interesting dish, needed a little more flavor in my opinion.  I'm a big lover of spinach and I added some cheddar cheese to this dish and it was really good.

Have seen that there are a lot of good reviews.. and a few that say I should have added more flavor in the recipe. This dish is a dish to highlight the beans and spinach flavor, and most importantly the very best extra virgin olive oil. It's a tapas food (bar food) so suppose to be paired with a good beer for light mellow flavor. As others have suggested you can add seasonings of your choice, or even crushed red pepper to spice up the dish, if it comes out too dry I recommended adding a bit more high quality olive oil, again depends on water content of beans and spinach - which can very everytime you make this dish. I really appreciate everyone's comments and suggestions to make this dish the best possible for each person individual tastes. And with any recipe, it's best to make it your own! ;)

This was quite good, a nice staple recipe (especially as I'm vegetarian). It was easy and quick to make. I might suggest a squeeze of lemon or Braggs before serving. It would also be good with fresh chopped tomatoes added to the pan while the garlic and onion are sauteeing.

This was a very easy, quick, and tasty recipe! I really enjoyed it. I used less oil than the recipe called for, and it turned out very well. That was the only thing I changed when making this recipe. Give this one a try! It is very good, and very healthy!

Yum!  Used half a bag of fresh spinach and replaced the cumin with rosemary.  When I put the spinach in, I added salt, pepper, a little lemon, and a little more oil.  Next time I would add rosemary to the pan while beans/onion are browning.  Also, it was a little dry, so I might save a little bean juice to add toward the end and smash the beans a little.  Served w/ quinoa, tomato, onion, lemon and cilantro, it's a super-fast vegan meal.

This was really delicious! I opted not for the cumin, I like cumin but it didn't match the flavors of the menu.  I didn't totally squeeze the spinach dry b/c some complained that it was dry so I left a little water in it.  I couldn't help to wonder if fresh cream drizzled over would make it better (of course, to me, cream makes everything divine). It was so good and added a little moisture and sauciness to it, I added about 3 to 4 tablespoons.

This is an excellent dish hot or cold and as a side or main dish.  Adding a generous amount of lemon is a must.  I always use fresh spinach and toast the cumin.  Thanks for sharing.

Ridiculously easy and quick. Perfect for a light dinner. In fairness, I was being super lazy and impatient and left out the onion, so it was flavored only by the salt, cumin and garlic, but I loved it. Spooned it on small pieces of crusty baguette. Couldn't be more pleased with adding this one to the make-dinner-fast arsenal.

Espinacas con Garbanzos' Haiku: "I thought this was great! (I didn't 'lightly mash' beans.) Simple, graceful taste." I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh spinach instead of frozen, and since I love the texture of garbanzo beans, I didn't lightly mash them. I thought that I'd serve this side dish w/ grated cheese or hot sauce, but it stood wonderfully on its own - I really liked the addition of cumin, but I think that that particular spice could be swapped for another depending on the "theme" of your meal; for instance, if your main dish is an italian chicken, basil could stand in for cumin, and what-not. (This versatility, and the ease of preparation, will make this recipe a keeper in my book!)

Yes, served it at church potluck, made it for 28 servings and they all asked for the recipe.  I had some left over that I had made before, and was asked to take something for an event so took it cold with crackers and people piled it on and ate till it was all gone.  Highly recommend. Made it as stated in recipe.

I really enjoyed this. I used fresh spinach and added it to the skillet last. I was out of cumin so I used a small pinch of the curry powder that I made from a personal recipe on this site (Bon Apetito). I served this with Fast Salmon with a Ginger Glaze (Chef John) and brown rice. Great recipe. I will add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat the next time I make it.

This was just delicious! I used a 1-lb bag of fresh spinach and instead of fresh garlic, I opted to use up 4 cloves of roasted garlic - just smashed them up and added them with the onions.   Amazing how a fast and simple recipe, with just a few ingredients, can come together so nicely! I'll be making this weekly!

This was an easy side dish with a casserole. I used a bag of frozen spinach (thawed). The bag was 16oz so if you do that if up the salt and cumin to 3/4 tsp maybe but I love cumin.

We really enjoyed this "Espinacas con Garbanzos (Spinach with Garbanzo Beans)" recipe (4 stars), and love it with lemon juice (5 stars). Thank you Vanessa for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I love this. We make it all the time exactly as directed. It's a great, easy, healthy side dish that goes especially well with chicken or pork.

This was a really easy idea to add something different for my work lunches.  I did make a few additions.  One of the video suggested squeezing lemon juice for some tang.  I used a lime.  I also added some red pepper flakes and very little chicken broth.  I wanted something a bit more filling so I mixed in some tuna as well.  This may not be your cup of tea, but it's delicious to me.  When you consider the North African origins, it just feels like a very earthy dish.

I just made this and it is really good!!  The only change I made was I used fresh baby spinach and added about a tablespoon of water when I added that spinach at the last to add a bit more moisture while the spinach wilted.  All the flavors are great together!!

Super delicious and healthy.  I sauteed the onions and garlic first and then added the garbanzo beans to the mix to heat them up alittle (since they were in can) and crushed them in that mixture before adding spinach (much easier!).  I also used fresh spinach and sauteed that separately and then I combined everything.   Def a keeper!

Subbed Swiss chard for the spinach.  Kids absolutely loved it and ate the entire dish!  Great new flavor for garbanzos and spinach.  Filling dish.  Nutritionally  perfect for the vegan, vegetarian and GF diets frequently served in our house.

I thought this was pretty good. I liked it much more than I expected I would. I did make a few changes. I used a 6oz bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I hate mincing garlic, so I just sliced it which saved time. This actually was rather quick to make. I was worried the cumin and salt would be a little strong. I used low sodium garbanzo beans and rinsed and drained them. I also cut the amount of salt in half and added 2 pinches only of cumin plus a pinch of garlic salt. TY

I made this tonight and it couldn't be simpler or tastier!! My only variation was to use fresh spinach and I cut back on the salt by using 1/4 teaspoon. (I prefer to add it later if it needs it.) This will definitely be in my rotation!

Yum!  So easy, and delicious!  It looks so simple, but the flavors really come together, and it tastes awesome.  My husband and I ate the whole thing for our main dish!  It does not have a very "spinach-y" taste, probably because of the seasonings.  Try it!

I happened on this looking for something to do with garbanzo beans. It is so delicious! I add quite a bit more cumin and use fresh spinach. We've had it about 5 times since I discovered the recipe. So simple and yummy!

I actually made this exactly as written with only  one small change and I thought it was great. All I did was use pan spray and only 1 teaspoon of the oil, otherwise I stuck to the recipe. DH on the other hand, didn't care for it.  Oh, he ate it because he'll eat just about anything, but he complained the whole time.   I'll definitely make this again, but I'll save it for my own lunch.  Thank you so much for the post.

I thought I would really like this, since I love the two main ingredients, but it turned out dry and didn't seem that flavorful. It needs some sauce or something. If I try it again, I'll add bouillon and/or more onion.

I didn't have any onion so I subbed in onion powder and used fresh spinach.  Loved it!  I wasn't able to taste the cumin so I'll increase that next time. I ate almost all of it myself.  Will definitely be making it again many times.

I absolutly love this recipe as is. I always use fresh spinach, usually when it's not looking so fresh anymore.  Unbelievably good for such few ingredients and such little time and effort put into it. I usually make it as a side dish and then end up eating the leftovers alone for lunch the next day.  So good.

I made this with Cannellini beans instead of chickpeas because I did't have any in my cupboard. Next time I'll have them on hand. But, this was so  delicious anyway! Either way, it's a good recipe.

Had this recently at a tapas restaurant and loved it. This recipe replicates it exactly. Very very tasty and easy to make. I used fresh spinach and just wilted it at the end. Also sautéed the onions separately and then added the garlic with the beans because garlic tends to burn if cooked for a long time. Loved the result and definitely making it again. Great dish!!

This is tasty, healthy, easy and low cal! What more can I ask for? I make it with fresh spinach and sweet onion. Great side dish and delicious for a light lunch the next day.

I added more cumin. If you don't want the dish to be so dry, don't completely dry the spinach

Out of this world!  I steamed frozen spinach for 8 minutes on a pot of water first. I added the spice to the sautéed the onions and garlic, then added the spinach, and finally the beans.

So easy, so fast, and so GOOD!  I struggle to add vegetables to my children's diet but both my eight year old and my 3 year old liked this.  You could definitely eat this with some rice as a meal on its own.  We served this with basmati rice and a rotissire chicken for a quick healthy weeknight meal.

used 12 oz of fresh spinach, and added half of the cumin, then added the rest little by little to be sure
that i didn't use too much. a little extra olive oil, and a grate of fresh nutmeg were the only changes i made. 
someone mentioned that a little white wine would be good, so i'll try that next time. very tasty.
i think a little smoked paprika would be a good addition.
i may try it using white beans in place of the garbanzos.
with some sliced spanish style chorizo added, and crusty bread, this would be be a great, easy, fast meal.

I am SO thankful I found this recipe. I absolutely LOVE it. I use it as a side dish. Fabulous. I, too, add a bit of lemon juice for added flair. But even without - this dish ROCKS! Thanks for sharing!

Very good. Made the mistake of using baby fresh spinach it tended to clump together, next time will try using frozen spinach as recipe calls.

This was great! I've made it twice so far and it's a hit...even my carnivore boyfriend loves it. The only adjustment I made was adding a little chicken stock at the end because it looked a little dry.

I make this often. Easy and delicious dish. I always make a recipe my own by adding my own ingredients. I've add different spices, veggies, and cheeses to the mix. Usually comes out great. Serve with rice and you have your meal.

Very delicious and basic. If you appreciate the flavors of spinach and garlic in addition to the texture of garbanzo beans, you will love this. Personally, it was a little bland for me and I added more cumin.

For me and my family this was only so, so.  In my opinion the beans needed some sort of sauce to off set the natural dryness that they have. I ended up tossing them into the blender, adding a bit more salt and enough water and EVOO to almost cover the beans then blended them into a tahini free hummus. That got a much better review from the family (including my one year old).

I thought this recipe was very delicious, healthy and fresh tasting.  I lowered the oil to 1 tsp, and the recipe tasted very good, however since I like a little extra zest I added a can of diced tomatoes right at the end to give it a little extra liquid and zing.  Either way it is a really good vegetarian/vegan main dish or side dish.  I will make again.

I made my garganzos in the crockpot and they were wonderful.  I then made this recipe with frozen spinach and found it to be very tasty.  Next time I will use fresh spinach.  This is perfect for any vegan looking to add protein into their meals.

Great for light lunches especially when I'm supposed to be on a diet! hahaha. Used fresh baby spinach and followed the rest. Had a buttery taste at the end from the garbanzo beans. I have to admit though, it does need a stronger seasoning to it.

This is a good, healthy side dish. I used fresh spinach and added it after the garbanzos were heated through, I only let it barely wilt (that is how we like it). I omited the cumin (personal preference). Next time, I think I will cut back on the garlic a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make, healthy and taste great.  I did not mash the beans as a matter of preference.  Thank you for sharing.

Nice and simple, tasted great. I thought the cumin and the spinach went really well together, but this didn't surprise me--cumin is one of the spices that make palak paneer so delicious! I didn't smash the beans, but I might next time. I might also add a bit of lemon juice or tomato next time. I honestly never bother draining frozen spinach--nine times out of ten the recipe tells you to add water anyway, so why bother? Or else I find I need to add some because things are too dry. Anyway, this was simple to make and tasted great.

I love this recipe! And what a bonus being so good for you too!  Used double the spinach since it was a 20 oz frozen bag ,added some chicken bouillon and water to cook it for a little bit.  It was a wonderful accompaniment to a grilled pork loin. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Healthy, yummy, and CHEAP! 
My family was a bit Leery of it at first.
My Dad and I normally hate cooked spinach. But Dad's words "you managed to make cooked spinach really good! Normally it takes a ton of cheese and seasoning to do that."
Only complaint is that the Garbanzo beans were not that soft. Maybe I didnt cooked them long enough or maybe thats just the way they are supposed to be??

I love both spinach and garbanzo beans, and this recipe was a super nice treat!  I didn't do a very good job mashing the beans. I used a potato masher, so maybe next time I'll use a fork, but that would take some time. Otherwise, delicious!

I used fresh spinach and a extra can or garbanzo beans.  Otherwise I didn’t change a thing.  My whole family gobbled this up.

I liked the combination of flavors, but taking a clue from one of Chef John's recipes, added 1/4 cup of pan roasted pine nuts. This gave a very appealing textural difference.

I have made this recipe several times, but I find the strong cumin keeps it from being something I can share with many others.  Today I tried putting 1/4 t. cumin and 1/4 teaspoon curry powder (both a bit scant) and I think I found the winning combination.  If you have never tried this, 1/4 t. curry is not enough that you consider the dish a curry dish but it gives the dish a tasty flavor.

I studied abroad in Seville, Spain and ate garbanzos con espinacas multiple times a week. I can say this was a great rendition of that dish! I personally like the flavor the cumin gives it.

I loved this. As others have said; you can really change this up to suit your tastes.  I used fresh baby spinach since that's what I had and I prefer fresh to frozen.  As others suggested, I added a little chicken stock and lemon juice after it was done as well as a little feta.  I did add the cumin but only a sprinkling.  It just seemed flat without it.

Something seemed off with this recipe. made exactly as written, and although it did not taste bad, we didn't care if we ever had it again. It did not make me want more. I served it with a southwestern pork loin and rice.  Maybe a little more seasoning??  Not sure...

This is my absolute favourite dish of all time! I first made this dish a little over a year ago following the recipe exactly--it was good and paired well with my (attempt at) paella and was a hit with my Spanish class. When I made it again I modified the recipe adding cinnamon and turmeric as well as a little vinegar and cayenne and realized that this only made it that much better! Now it's my signature dish (so to say) and I'm constantly making it trying slightly different combinations of spices or types of onions etc. and pairing it with other dishes and it's great! I rave about this dish constantly!

This dish made me miss being vegetarian! Super savory, loved the cumin, but might try other herbs as some reviewers have suggested. I think it's great as a side or main, hot or cold. Don't need to add anything, but if I'm feeling creative, I might. Used fresh Okinawan Spinach from my garden. Tastes healthy and deeelicious!  Thank you!

Yummy, yummy, yum, yum!  The only change I made was using fresh spinach.  I tasted it before putting the cumin in and it was yummy that way, but I liked it with the cumin, too.  Will be making again and again.

I am yet to find a better side dish than this, honestly! Spinach and garbanzo beans is a match made in heaven... Onion and garlic give it veggie flavor, and nutmeg just completes it. As other reviews suggested, I did use a splash of water to help spinach cook and keep its color bright green, and served it with white fish and brown rice. After I tried it, I let the fish and rice be and finished several helpings of this delicious dish, it can indeed be a meal on its own! I made it several times since and will keep making! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This is delicious!  However, it seemed a little dry as it was cooking so I added a little chicken broth.  That made it easier to smash the beans and added a nice flavor surprise.

I used dried garbanzos (soaked 8 hours/then cooked approximately 2 hours in chicken broth), fresh spinach, dash of lemon juice and fresh ground black pepper.  It is SO delicious.  Going into my regular menu rotation for sure.

This dish is simple to make and very tasty!  I made it as is and enjoyed every bite.  My only tweak is next time I won't squeeze as much moisture out of my frozen spinach.  My spinach got a bit dry at the end of cooking.  More water, or oil if you like, will keep it from drying out.  Regardless, this recipe is a keeper!

We both liked this, which is somewhat surprising, because I'm not a big fan of cooked spinach.  However, the flavors in this meld well, and the cooked spinach doesn't bother me like it usually does.  I forgot to mash the beans, so I mashed them a little in my bowl, and that helped a bit. My only complaint is that there should be less spinach or more garbanzo beans.  Otherwise, this is a hit in our house and I am willing to make it again!  thanks for the recipe!

Not bad.  Made as is but wish I would've read the reviews and added paprika.  Next time I'll do that.  I did add extra garlic to it.  Paired it with chicken.

Mmmm, this was delicious! Some of the other reviews criticized the cumin, so I just sprinkled a few pinches on top when I was stirring in salt and pepper. Very tasty and simple to make!

This was pretty good. I used frozen spinach, but I think it would be better with fresh, since the spinach was kind of dry by the end. And, I think if you're going to use frozen, you need 2 boxes of frozen spinach for the rest of the proportions of ingredients to work as written. I didn't use onion, since in Spain I don't remember them using any. I cooked the spinach in one pan. Then in another I put the garlic and olive oil with 2 slices of bread torn up into pieces. When the bread and garlic were golden brown, I took them out and ground it together with the a full tsp of cumin, more salt than called for, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and 2 tsps of paprika (paprika is key to make it authentic spanish!). Then I combined it all and let it heat through for a few minutes, mashing it together.

As written this is a good  recipe, and I reccomend it as is. How ever everytime I make it there is an addition and last nights was the best. I added some bacon, jalapenos, cubed chicken breast, doubled the cumin, some red pepper flakes, and mixed in a can hot rotel tomatoes. No left overs.

Ran out of cumin so I threw in turmeric. This made it a little more middle eastern/indian but it was tasty! Next day mixed it with some egg noodles and feta and my daughter loved it!

Like many, I made this with what I had on hand but varied little from the recipe. Spinach was frozen (thawed and drained) and I had a jar of minced garlic so I put in four rounded teaspoons for the four garlic cloves.  (I do love garlic.)  It was SOOO good.  I've had it as both meals and side dishes, eating it up (as I'm the only one eating it).  I not only will fix it again, I'm passing it on to my favorite friends whom I know will love it.  And for those who doubt cumin with spinach?  Get over it, it's great!!  A+

Wow, wow, wow. Just as written. Had to cut myself off, I am so full right now. Was worried about the amount of garlic, but it was perfect (although I no doubt have garlic breath right now). Even my extremely picky 10 year old liked it. Will be making this on a very regular basis.

This is super fast and easy to make and tastes delicious. I added about twice as much cumin as it called for because it is my favorite spice. It paired well as a side dish to grilled chicken but I also had a similar dish at a restaurant with fish. Next time I might try adding some sun dried tomatoes to add a contrasting color. I will definitely make this again

This was very tasty.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because there was a LOT of garlic in it, which I think would turn some people off.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen (10 ounces I think).

Loved this!  I admit I was hesitant to add the cumin in this recipe so instead of adding the 1/2 tsp I just shook a little on it and then tasted.  I really liked the flavor so I added the rest! This recipe is super fast.  My husband thought it was a little bland so maybe a little more cumin next time.

Delicious!! I ate this with foccacia on the side and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt. Yum! definitely a winner. I used fresh spinach as well, and cooked the garbanzo beans first, as noted in the reviewer below. A great recipe!

This was really good!  I cant really give it a star rating bc I made it a little differently.  I used chili powder instead of cumin, but it had a great flavor.  Next time will add more spinach and a spinkle of parmisian cheese.  :)

I used fresh spinach and eliminated the cumin. It's now been annointed a "keeper" recipe in our home. Also, next time I want to mash the garbanzo beans before cooking.

This is as great as the reviews say ... Easy, fast ... I doubled the recipe, used frozen spinach (although the fresh is very tempting ...) and will make sure I keep all the ingredients pantry ready for quick meals on late work nights. A true time saver. Thank you.

This is a perfect snack and side dish for every one in the house. I cooked my garbanzo beans from the bag in my crock pot for about 6 hours. They came out the consistency of butter. I am going to try it with fresh spinach for a party in a few days.

I used a whole onion rather than half and cooked it until it was browned and almost caramelized before adding the other ingredients. This was fast, delicious, and cheap. I basically always have these ingredients on hand, so it's also a convenient go-to dish. I will definitely make this again!

These were delicious and my family enjoyed them very much. The combination of spinach and garbanzo beans is terrific. I made exactly as the recipe is written except that I doubled it. I can't quite shake the thought that something was missing, though, that would have improved the recipe even more. If I figure it out the next time I make this, I will write more. Very tasty dish. Thanks for posting it!

This turned out to be very tasty, but I changed it quite a bit, which is why I'm giving it four stars. I decided to go for more of an Indian theme, and added ginger, garam masala and ground red pepper. I wish I had had some lemon juice to add, but I ended up using a splash of red wine vinegar instead. Ate it over rice, and it was yummy and very healthy!  At the restaurant where I used to work, we would use a cloth napkin to squeeze all the water out of thawed spinach. At home I use an old tea towel that I don't care whether it gets stained or not. A very easy way to squeeze every drop of water out without freezing your hands!

I suppose this has potential, it just needed a lot more flavor. I tried to caramelize the onions a little bit but it didn't seem to do anything. I used frozen spinach so that could have been the problem. Maybe a splash of balsamic or wine would help.

i used fresh spinach which i had washed so there was enough liquid in the recipe for me. i would suggest using the liquid from the garbanzo beans if you feel it is too dry. i also used cumin seeds which i roasted in the olive oil prior to putting the rest of the ingredients in. wonderful recipe, reminds me of chana masala (try it if you want something spicier with rice). feeds two as a main dish. thanks!

This turned out better than I thought it would.  It did end up dry, but my hubby thought of garnishing it with non fat plain yogurt, which did the trick.  He threw it in a pita and ate 3!  Will definitely make again.  Simple, easy, fast and tasty!

Personally I did like this. It could have just been personal palate and taste, but for me the spinach and garbanzos just didn't work well together. I did end up throwing it into a food processor and adding tahini to make it more like a hummus type dish.

This is a good recipe, but I wanted a little more zip so I upped the garlic and cumin a little.  The flavors are great together as is, it is just a matter of personal preference.

**My original review is below.  After making this many times over, I decided to try it without the cumin.  My husband and I thought it was so much better without it.  Make it either way, you will like it!** I thought it was Great recipe as is. However if you prefer a bit more "zip", use a whole onion, 7-8 cloves of garlic, 1 t. cumin and 1/4 t. crushed red pepper.  With the addition of extra onion and garlic, I used 2 T. EVOO. I like this served room temperature with some crusty bread...tapas style!

Ah okay...tasted it and it was pretty bland as is...even added parmesan cheese and lemon juice which made it better. I just dont think garbanzo beans and Spinach go well together.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it as written and also ended up adding water at the end because it was drying out (I had really squeezed the spinach dry).  It's great as a side dish, but next time I might sauce it up a bit and use it as a topping for whole wheat pasta.  This is a keeper!!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!! I knew I was gonna like it because I love spinach and garbanzo beans, but this dish really exceeded my expectations. I did, however, omit the cumin because I'm not a huge fan of it and it turned out wonderful. This will be a new staple at our house! Thanks for posting :)

love this recipe!! Super easy to prepare and can be modified to suit your taste. I added in a bit more garlic and a dash of paprika, put a splash of chicken broth in and gobbled the whole thing up by myself for lunch =) Thanks for the recipe.

Very dry. Added chicken broth while cooking.  More spices needed--possilbly curry or a medley of indian spices.  Might be good with chicken

Wonderful idea for a quick and light meal. Also, the ingredients are so basic that they are most always available in my kitchen. Used frozen spinach because that was what was on hand, but next time I will definitely use fresh spinach.

This was great - fast, simple, and made with ingredients I always keep on hand.  Thank you.  (Oh, and garlic powder works just fine.)

Very delicious, flavorful but no so much so as to overwhelm whatever you serve with it. I will be making it again, no changes, thanks very much for sharing.

Old mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to make dinner, and all she really had was a can of garbanzo beans and a bag of fresh spinach in the fridge.  This was amazing and so easy! I loved the cumin, and I feel it would have been bland without it.

Left out the soy sauce.  I didn't have a shallot so I added an extra clove of garlic and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Yummy!  I'm going to add some Italian sausage next time for a complete meal.

I had to use white beans because I was out of garbanzos.  It was good, but needed a little more pizazz.  I will probably make it again with garbanzos  just because it is so healthy.

Had an earthy flavor, like a kale and quinoa dish I've made.  The cumin and extra virgin olive oil are great additions.  But, coming from someone who enjoys spinach and chickpeas, the flavor seemed just a bit lacking... like it needed a bit of zest... maybe sundried tomatoes or lemon?  I would like to try this again, and add a little something.  What to add?  I'm not sure.  Still, it's definitely a worthwhile recipe, and I did enjoy it.

I lived in Barcelona for 6 years and this was one of my favourites. I add a few toasted pine nuts and a sprinkle of Jerez vinegar. I serve it with a Caprese salad and a butifara. I use Beyond Sausage. This meal puts me right back in beautiful Barcelona.

I made this dish as described but I did take others advice to add some pepper flakes. I also added some oregano which added to the spice flavour profile. I had a bag of fresh spinach blend with kale and chard which also added to the dish.

Made it as is.  It's very good.  I was a little worried about the cumin.  Too much cumin makes food taste soapy to me.  (Maybe that's just me.) . But in this case, it was very subtle.  I took the leftovers to work for a healthy lunch.  Thank you so much for the healthy dish!!

I added a grain (farro)  to this recipe in order to make it a fuller main course dish. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I put the espinacas con garbanzos on top of the cooked farro and it was positively delicious and filling. Added extra lemon.

Surprisingly, my family loved this!  (They aren't so keen on spinach, historically.)  We tried it because we got interested in Spain and Portugal recently.  The video recommended a sprinkle of lemon juice at the end, which does enhance the flavors magically.  I used a bunch of fresh spinach and removed the stems, then chopped it all.  I also added 1/4 tsp paprika after reading one of the reviews (might try more next time).  I added the spices with the garlic, added a little water to keep it from sticking to the pan, and then added the chickpeas after about a minute of spices cooking.  I mashed most of the beans before adding the spinach.

I like spinach and I like garbanzo beans but I didn't care for this dish.  I followed the recipe and I  wasn't pleased with it. I ended up adding white wine and a bit more olive oil after I tasted the original recipe and I still didn't care for it. 

It looks appetizing but this one isn't for me.

Great as a main course or side. It was my main course, my husband had some turkey breast with his. I followed the recipe with some exceptions: I omitted the cumin,  instead of onions, I used onion powder. Based on previous reviews about a bit of dryness at the end of cooking, I combined a couple of reviewer's suggestions and added a splash of lemon juice and cream to finish. I used heavy cream. Why heavy cream? Because it's delicious and heavy cream will not curdle with acidic foods or liquids. I also seasoned with salt to taste after adding the salt from the recipe. I enjoyed something new and will be making this again!

I made this and loved it. I am not fond of Cumin,  so when a recipe calls for it I usually use about half of what is called for. I added coriander to this recipe only because I enjoy coriander with chickpeas. All in all a nice dish and I will make it again .

Absolutely delicious!  I added cauliflower and baby bella mushrooms.  I also substituted pinto beans for the garbanzo beans since that was all I had.  I sauteed the onions in the olive oil for a few minutes, then added cauliflower florets.  After about 5 minutes, I added the garlic, spinach, and beans and added a tablespoon of chicken broth.  I covered it and simmered until spinach was wilted.  I added various seasoning to taste and spiced it up a bit with a pinch of habanero seasoning.  I am trying to decrease my intake of meat and eat more beans for protein and this served as a main dish for me and is quite fulfilling.  This will become a staple.  Thanks for a simple and great recipe!!!

This was delicious! I could have eaten the entire thing by myself - and I don't really care for spinach! I did use fresh chopped spinach, and onion powder instead of onion.

This recipe has so many of my favorites. So I made it as directed. I will relish the leftovers and make it again. I've got to spice it up just a smidge. I'm open to suggestions other than salt.

Slightly mashed the chick peas while cooking and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Used fresh spinach and nutmeg (enhances the flavour of green vegetables) in place of cumin.  Would add a touch of chicken stock next time.

Hmmm Ive made this recipe twice now and I have to say I'm disappointed. I love all the ingrediets but something about this is off. If I make this again ill probably top with hot sauce or maybe add some  red pepper flakes, its fairly bland. I would probably also use fresh spinach and cook with the garbanzos so they are softer.

Didn't make any changes, and will not make it that way ever again.  I love spinach,garlic, and garbanzo beans so I thought we would just love this dish.  The cumin was awful and it just lacked something.  Sorry---Sorry we tried it.

I had some baby spinach I needed to use before it went bad and this was the perfect recipe.  Once I smashed the beans worth a fork it did get dry . . . So I just added some beef broth I had in the fridge.  I'm pretty sure chicken broth would be good too.  I did add some black pepper.  Next time I will omit the salt as it seemed it was in the verge of being salty.  Great recipe.

I just happened to get fresh spinach and was looking for a recipe to use it in and came across this!  I used 6 cloves of garlic (I'm Italian after all!) and added 2T butter.  Left out the cumin and used the TJs everyday seasoning.  DE-lightful as a light meal!!

I thought that this dish was bland and I did not care for the cumin. I then doctored it up with curry powder, picante sauce and cream. It was better but not great. I added dill and it was good. Next time I will leave out the cumin. I am looking for Vegetarian Thanksgiving dishes to serve to my vegetarian family members. Not sure that this is the one.

A really good start but I took away a star because i had to bump up the flavors and moisture a bit - added a glug of white wine, a few small tomatoes that were going soft and additional garlic. I always like a little acid with greens, so I served with a squeeze of lemon. The cumin was OK, but not sure if I would use again. I ate this as a light dinner, could see throwing a bit of feta or goat cheese to make it a little more hearty.

I used fresh spinach. I had to add a little broth or it would have completely dried out. I ate the dish right away and was not thrilled about the combination of spinach and cumin. Hubby ate later and it seemed to taste way better after it had a chance to mellow. Still, I think I prefer spinach and chick peas with Mediterranean flavours. I believe this is a very good recipe, just not to my personal tastes. Thanks anyways Vanessa.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I thought this turned out pretty tasty.  I can see myself playing around with the spices a little bit to try something new. The chickpeas and spinach go well together, and it's certainly healthier than some other side dishes. I think I'll be making this again.

I just made this. My house smells amazing. I put lard in the cast iron, browned the chickpeas for a while and added spices including curry. I did not use cumin as it is a hispanic herb and I wanted to make this more Indian. I used fresh spinach and just wilted it. I added salt, garlic powder, pepper, and it is so so so good. My one year old is chowing down on them.

I was craving this dish after having it at a tapas restaurant and this recipe was the perfect fix! I liked the suggestion of adding a little chicken broth for some extra depth. I also threw in a some cayenne. I'm the type of girl that usually needs some sort of fish/chicken to feel like I'm having a complete meal but this is a great quick and filling meal.

I made this with fresh spinach. I sautéed the onions and garlic, then added the garbanzo beans plus a little water and smashed part of them. Then I added the spinach, salt, and cumin and cooked until the spinach was wilted. It was very flavorful and delicious! I wasn't so sure about cumin and spinach together, but the cumin did not overpower  (I actually used a little less than a half teaspoon). Hubby ate all of his but did not comment. Not my most favorite veggie, but I plan to make it every once in awhile.

Thanks Vanessa for this recipe. This is sooo good I've made it twice now. I did change/add some ingredients. I used black beans,fresh baby spinach, red bell pepper, onion, fresh cilantro, garlic, onion powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and S&P of course. I also steamed two chicken breasts cut up and added to the skillet, you might need a little liquid at the end so add chicken broth or water to loosen up. I eat all this over brown rice....delicious!!! Full of protein too.

A Winner!
I make this often now, usually with fresh spinach. I add a pat of butter to the olive oil for extra flavor.  Both garbanzo beans and white beans work.  Both taste delicious, but the white beans are easier to mash a bit in the skillet.  Super quick, healthy side dish or light main dish.

Given all the WOW reviews I thought this would be a real winner. Whipped it up and I found it quite bitter and a non-starter.  Was about to open a can of veggies to use. Instead I added a diced banana and that saved the day for me. The sweetness of the banana sure helped relieve the bitterness of the frozen spinach. I will try it again but with fresh.

This is a delicious recipe. I used fresh spinach once and that worked very well too. Simple and delish!

Awesome recipe! I added a can of tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer. I also added a dash of five spice powder. Is VERY glad my husband is not a vegetable eater!

I have made this dish twice now and love it every time.  Even my husband and sons, who don't like spinach enjoy it.  The only difference I did was to use fresh spinach.  Great recipe to try and incorporate spinach into our diet.

I don't know what makes this simple dish sooo good but it is! By mistake I used Curry instead of Cumin and I'm glad I did! I loved this! I served it over warm brown rice. Yummmm!! Almost forgot ... 1/2 onion looked like way to much so I probably only used 1/4 of one.

Very flavorful and tasty. I reduced the oil to about 1-2 T and used fresh spinach instead. I think I added a dash of extra cumin as well.

I love spinach, garlic, and garbanzo beans, but this was not a good mix. Onion was the main flavor, but it was just overall bland and unpalatable. I'd rather just eat garbanzo beans out of a can, with spinach as a side dish!

I loved this recipe!  I changed it a bit by using fresh spinach, using water instead of oil (to reduce fat), and reducing the onion and garlic by a bit because I didn't use the entire amount of spinach.  SO YUMMY!  I posted a review of it on my blog as well:  http://masterofherromaine.blogspot.com/2010/08/first-day-of-grad-school.html  I cook a lot of veggie based dishes!

This was awesome!!! I ran out of cumin, so I substituted it with some cajun seasoning instead. Also, to keep it from getting dry towards the end I added some vegetable broth and a couple of splashes of white wine. YUM! Even my boyfriend who "hates spinach" ate some and didn't complain! Will definitely make again!

I loved the simplicity of this healthy, flavorful dish!  We ate it as a side dish with grilled chicken for dinner, and I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Perfect recipe using items already in my pantry.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe for Lent.  I prepared as written but used fresh spinach.  I served it as a main course by wrapping it in whole wheat tortillas folded burrito style.  Oh, and I added no salt.  Everyone liked it despite the groans before they tried it.  We will be having this again.  I can already imagine variations such as adding balsamic vinegar and omitting the cumin.  Or keeping the cumin and adding curry powder and ground ginger.  There are lots of possibilities.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

My husband and I loved this.  We are watching calories and creating side dishes that are not rice, bread or noodles becomes a challenge.  This I served with a sauteed chicken breast and additional veggies.  Filling and satisfying.

This had great flavor. But I'm not sure that I'm a big fan of chick peas, the ones that didnt mash were hard and dry. Might try again but with a softer bean.

Quick, tasty and very easy to make. It is dry though and I suggest either adding water or some other liquid, or simply don't squeeze all the water from the spinach. Will definitely make again and again :)

This was a wonderful surprise!! I have never had garbanzo beans so wasn't sure what to expect but this was so good. The only changes I made was using cayenne pepper instead of the cumin, buy only because my cumin fell behind the stove when I went to get it out of the spice cabinet :-(. I just finished up the leftovers for my morning snack at work.. the leftovers were just as good. Yummy, thank you!

We loved this.  A nice change from the usual sauteed spinach.  I added some vegetable stock to moisten it up a bit.  It turned out great.  I did however use fresh leaf spinach with the spines removed.  Fresh spinach is more hearty than baby or even frozen spinach.  The cumin is the key to the recipe.

I loved this. I even got my husband (who says he doesn't like spinach and onions) to try it and he liked it too. I didn't have garbanzo beans so I used pinto. I'm sure any bean you like would be good in this dish.

I LOVE this dish, but agree that this recipe is a little bland. Obviously fresh spinach and beans cooked from scratch are better, but I think frozen spinach and canned beans are OK here.

Loved this!  The flavor is excellent!  This is such an easy side that could even be turned into a nice vegetarian entree.  The recipe makes alot but there were no leftovers with the four of us.

I enjoyed this a lot.  I couldn't get to the store so I just used what I had in the pantry.  I didn't add the salt, I used canned spinach (drained the excess liquid prior to adding), and I put in a whole onion.  I added extra garlic and cumin.  Next time I make it I will mash the garbanzo beans all the way (don't enjoy the texture of the whole beans) and use less oil.  We grilled some tomato's and made this into mini sub sandwiches with a bit of baked turkey on top.  Nice and healthy.

This was very good. I did use one whole onion and upped the cumin to one teaspoon after reading reviews saying the dish needed more flavor. Served this with brown rice. Leftovers were just as great the next day for lunch.

Great dish! So healthy and easy. We really enjoyed but it still needs a little more flavor.

This was good, but it was missing something for me. I will try this again and maybe add some parmesan cheese or another seasoning to this..or perhaps some diced tomatoes

I have this cooking on the stove, but I had to take a taste of it.  WOW.  I love it!!!  It's so delicious, I can't wait for my husband to try it.  I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach - nuked it for five minutes with NO WATER added.  Once the five minutes were up, I didn't even need to drain it.  Even my four year old and three year old just ate their small "No Thank You" bites!!

Excellent combination !!I would add a bit of chicken broth or boullion for a bit more flavor even some red flakes or chili powder for a bit of a kick!

Very tasty and fast!  I was looking for a recipe where I could use up garbanzos and a porkchop and I'm so glad I found this.  I used fresh garbanzos (cooked) and didn't have any spinach, so used fresh chard.  I cubed the leftover (cooked) porkchop and added it when I added the garbanzos.  I served it as a main dish with rice.  It was delicious, I will definitely be making this again!

This was just okay for us.  I'm giving it 4 starts since it was easy to make and very healthy but I was the only one in my family who liked it.  Sorry-just wasn't to our liking I guess.

Very good and very easy to make. I used fresh baby spinach and added it to the chickpeas the last 2 minutes to wilt it a bit.

This was very good, added a little extra cumin and garlic. Was not dry as others found served with brown rice and orzo, great for a meatless dinner.

Definitely quick, healthy and very easy!  I doubled the cumin and added some onion powder as well.  It just seemed lacking in taste a bit as I was cooking it, so I made those adjustments.  I'm thinking that the flavors will develop, though.  Will be making this again.

Delicious!  I modified a little - added some mushrooms and a couple dashes of curry.  I served with whole wheat couscous - what a hit!  A great vegan dish.

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I was looking for the recipe from Sevilla, which you mention in the header; but this recipe is missing Spanish paprika (about 1 tablespoon) and the fact that you saute the garlic cloves whole, then you saute a couple of rounds of bread and you mash it all together.  Reading the reviews it seems to taste fine, but I can't imagine it without the missing items.

I loved the idea that this dish was so healthy. But I used a fresh bag of fresh spinach instead since that was what i had. It ended up great. At least for me. My husband didn'tthink it was THAT delicious, but nexttime, hopefully he'll come around. Great recipe!

This is a nice, simple side dish for something different.  I didn't think it was great, but I will probably make it from time to time.  I served it with grilled pork chops and red cabbage salad.

This was the easiest and fastest recipe to make!  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  The flavor was great thanks to the cumin.  Would definitely make it again.

Wow! Thanks so much for this recipe! This was light, healthy, and very filling, yet full of flavor!  I took other reviewers' advice and added 1/4 cup of chicken broth and sprinkled a little feta cheese in before serving.  I will make this dish again and again!

Some years ago my husband and I had gorged ourselves at a tapa bar in Barcelona.  We were seated at the bar and were about to call for the check when this dish went by, going to a table.  We looked at each other and I said, we'll order 1 and share.  "Heck no", said my husband and we ordered one each. We re-created the recipe the best we could, but this give us the fine tuning we need.  Thanks, Vanessa!
