This is a really great "basic" meatball recipe. I put 5 meatballs in a ziploc and added 1/2 c of spaghetti sauce and froze them so I can have individual portions whenever. I halved this recipe and it made 64 meatballs.

These were pretty good, put needed some herbs and spices - I cut the recipe in half.  I left out the worcesterchire, cut down on the bread crumbs (used italian style vs. plain) added minced garlic, italian seasoning and grated parmesan cheese.  I baked them at 350 for 40 minutes turning once during cooking then added them to spaghetti sauce.

SO YUMMY! I used Italian Bread crumbs and they were AWESOME! I must have made mine a lot larger because I only got about 60 meatballs out of the recipe... I'll definitely make this one again!

I simmered these in a marinara sauce recipes (from this site) for 4 hours on low.  I used 1 lb. of sage ground sausage in place of all ground beef.  I also cut back a bit on the bread crumbs and used 1/2 cup of asiago cheese in the meatballs.  They were very tender and tasty.  Will make again.

As this recipe is written, these are standard meatballs. Good, but nothing great, until you add your seasonings or sauces. These are good, but they are what they are. They work great for being make-ahead meatballs waiting on you to compliment them!  Thank you for the recipe!

These meatballs are GREAT!!! I had my hubby try one right outta the oven first thing outta his mouth was YUM!! I did add some black pepper to it, but that was the only change.. Will use this one everytime! Thanks.... EDITED to add I know cut back the recipe to one serving and change the bread crumbs to oatmeal and use this for my meatloaf and I roll out flat and put ham and swiss in the middle,roll up and seal edges and bake OMG so good I get rave reviews everytime I serve this to company... This is a great recipe for meatballs and meatloaf with one small change... Thanks again..

I doubled this recipe and got 13 dozen for our big party.  They were perfectly seasoned and I did use Italian bread crmbs.  The sauce I used was from "Cocktail Meatballs II."  NOTE:  I mistakenly reviewed the Cocktail Meatballs instead of this one.  These are excellent.  I froze them in baggies and then thawed them in the freezer until they went in a crockpot with the sauce from Cocktail Meatballs II.

Great meatball. This went great with Nanny's spaghetti sauce but would have been just as great with brown gravy. These are a wonderful all purpose meatball and even though I only made what we needed for tonight's meal, I do think it would have been great if I had made the whole batch and froze them for later use. Hubby liked these enough to comment. Thanks! I'm def using this again!

I really like that this recipe is baked, not fried.  I found that after adding the bread crumbs to the eggy mixture it soaked up all of the moisture so when I finally added the ground beef, I had what looked like bread cubes in the meatballs.  Maybe I waited too long between steps?  Also, I halved the recipe and only had about 40 meatballs.  I even used a tablespoon measure to be certain I was doing it right.  Despite the weird difficulties I had, the meatballs turned out great.

Excellent recipe
I made these with seasoned croutons instead of the bread crumbs and added red peppers.  I also accidently put only two eggs instead of the 4 that are called for. They are a little dry but still very tasty.
I baked them on my broiler pan.
My grandchildren loved them. Rated 10 on this one.  This one is definitely a keeper.

I did use italian breadcrumbs as previous suggestions indicated.  I also used a good amount of seasoning salt.  Really good, but not anything too out of the ordinary.  Nice to have them frozen and on hand whenever you need them.

I thought these were great...very easy to do and quick to make. For health reasons, I'm on a low fat/no fat diet, so I made the following changes: 1) used panko bread crumbs (zero fat) 2) 90% lean ground beef 3) added shredded carrot and zuchini 4) used egg substitute instead My husband enjoyed them, I enjoyed them, but most importantly, my 3 year old loved them!!! He even got a full serving of veggies without evening knowing it!!!

Followed this recipe except for using black pepper instead of the white pepper.  I like this recipe because I was able to freeze these meatballs after they cooled off.  Will use this recipe again, and I'm giving it to my son who loves to cook.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are an excellent substitute for the purchased frozen meatballs, and so much cheaper.  I have to leave out the Worcestershire sauce because one of my  granddaughters had an allergic reaction to it when she tried one of these meatballs hot from the oven.    But they are still good basic meatballs.  I think the plainer flavor makes them more versatile because they will go with different types of sauces.

I love that these are baked, not fried, but I never bother to turn them. Ground turkey is a wonderful alternative to beef, and produces softer, more delicate meatballs. I divide the original recipe into 3-4 batches and add different seasonings and ingredients, clearly labeling the containers for the freezer. Try finely minced mushrooms and peppers for one, blackening seasoning for another, or even shredded spinach and toasted pine nuts. Variety is the spice of life!

I thought this was a good one.  I added some oregeno and thyme to give it an italian flaw but they are good to heat up.  I notice they were a bit dry but maybe I cooked them a bit long,  they stuck to the pan so maybe some of that release tin foil from reynolds.

I used this as a base for my first time making my own meatballs and they turned out really well!  Instead of the onion, salt and pepper I subbed a packet of onion soup mix, I used half of the bread crumbs and used 1 cup of parmesan cheese, added 1/2 cup milk to make sure they were moist and added 2 tsp. dried parsley for some color.  Very mild and versatile, plus cheaper than the pre-made bags of meatballs that I used to buy!  Thanks!

These worked out really well. I only had 2 eggs so I substituted some applesauce for the other 2 eggs--couldn't taste the fruit, thank goodness. I also used more bread crumb mixture than was strictly necessary but I was trying to stretch the meat--worked beautifully. I put a little extra seasoning in mine, namely some bottled steak sauce and I came out with a very tasty meatball suitable for a variety of sauces. We've had them thus far with sweet & sour sauce, Worcestershire sauce, & barbecue sauce. Very tasty, and they held up well--I dice the onions small. Big chunks of onion are too slimy to cling to!

these were really good and really easy.  i thought they needed a little more seasoning, but not enough to make a big difference.  I made these for a Wed. night church supper and they were a big hit.

Very tasty basic meatball. Used sea salt instead of regular..but made no other changes. One thing though, unless you are looking for microscopic meatballs, these do not make even close to the amount stated...I got about 40 meatballs that were less than 2 ounces each. Perfect for a good Italian pasta dinner!

Yes these are basic meatballs but they become a quick hot meal with a well-seasoned sauce and a starch.  I have made these for a new mom, a bachelor son, and a family under medical treatments and include a variety of sauces and starches to create a care package of easy meals.  I also keep a batch in the freezer for us.

absolutely the BEST meatballs....with a few adjustments. Instead of 4 lbs of hamburger, i used 1 lb hot sausage to three lbs of hamburger. I also put 3 tablespoons of worchestershire sauce instead of two, and instead of 1 tablespoon of salt, I used 1/2 tablespoon seasoning salt and 1/2 tablespoon garlic salt. I also added 1 1/2 cups of mushrooms and increased the amount of onion to 1 cup. They turned out to be the best meatballs i have ever had, and my husband and I look forward to a lot of leftovers!!!

Standard, inoffensive meatball recipe.  Any real flavor will come from what you put on the meatball.

I made these they are great to take out of the freezer for a fast meal. Meatball sandwich,or spagetti. My husband loves them. 20 in a freeezer bag is enough for the two of us.

Perfect!  Coming home from Costco with a huge lump of ground beef, I made these up and put them in the freezer.  I packaged them in batches of 25.  Perfect for our family for many different quick weeknight dinners.  Thanks.

I followed others' lead and added the parmesan, italian seasoning and a little bit of extra basil.  I tried baking before freezing.  But tried making the meatballs, freezing raw and then adding them frozen to homemade spaghetti sauce and let simmer 30" or longer.  The beef was good quality and the flavor that these meatballs imparted to the sauce was outstanding.  Thanks.  This recipe was a great starting point for me.

Delicious!  I only had 1 pound of ground beef, so I quartered the recipe and wound up with 16 very large meatballs.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and some onion powder, because I didn't have any onions on hand.  After baking the meatballs for about 10 minutes, I simmered them in 2 jars of store bought marinara sauce for 3 hours.  I used 96% lean ground beef and lined my cookie sheets with nonstick foil, and had no problems with the meatballs sticking or being too greasy.  They tasted wonderful and were by far the best meatballs I've ever made!  We used them for meatball subs, and they were fantastic.  A great recipe!

Simple, quick and really yummy! I loved how I was able to just cook them and pop  them into the freezer and eat them whenever my family and I had the craving for them. We made meat ball subs, and I even incorparted them with a simple Spaghetti Sauce and pasta.

I cut this recipe in half, and make the meatballs in to small patties, and cook for 10 minutes.  Take them out of the oven, and place a patty on the bottom of a dinner roll or mini hamburger bun. Top with cheese, put top of bun on and cover with foil.  Return the mini-burgers to the over for about 5 minutes.  I sometimes add a little onion and bacon, it's an easy and fun appetizer.

These are good and easy to make.  I was looking for recipes to make ahead and freeze.  These worked great for that.  WARNING...THE TEXTURE IS NOT LIKE A TYPICAL MEATBALL.  MORE LIKE A MEATLOAF. This didn't bother us, but a few guests commented that they didn't love the texture.

They just weren't worth the time and trouble. They produce sooo much grease, that all I was doing was washing greasy cookie sheets (and I cut the recipe in half). They also stuck to the pans and fell apart as I was trying to turn them over. I will stick with store-bought frozen meatballs from now on.

Great basic recipe.  I was afraid to doctor it up the second time around as I didn't want to make it bad. I reccomend letting the whole mixture sit for a bit (30 min) before rolling up the balls and putting them in the oven.  Also, the oven cooking, while super fast, is touchy, so be prepared to flip in under ten minutes!

These are great, and so easy to make.  I don't change a think.  My brother, who hates leftovers, had no idea these were frozen.  So convenient when I don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner.  I love that they are baked without sauce, and then when I defrost them I can put them in different sauces for variety.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I've been making meatballs a totally different way that took forever and always made them dry and burnt.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.  You can add all kinds of spices if you want to make it even tastier.

I did change the recipe a little. I wanted to add some extra vegetables and minced some bell peppers and carrots to add to the mix.  They had great flavor.

This wasn't a bad recipe, it just wasn't what I thought the end product would be. They were like meatloaf balls, which meatloaf is good, but like I said before, it wasn't what I was after. Thanks anyway.

Awesome meatballs, and so easy!  I didn't even turn mine, and they are perfect.  The only thing I may change is a little less salt.  I also got about 35 large meatballs and 35 cocktail size out of the recipe, not nearly as many as it states.  Mine must be larger, but I can't imagine wanting to make these small!  :)  I would probably serve two to three large meatballs per dinner serving, so they are a good size.
