This was a quick and easy recipe. Not to mention a very good one! I didn't have a dry white wine so I used a sweet white wine and I forgot to put the basil leaves in, but I wouldn't change a thing. I have 50 lbs. of Salmon to cook and have used many recipes and this is by far my favorite. We will definitely make it again and again.

OH! This was excellent! So flavorful and juicy. I used  all fresh herbs, but I was out of basil, so I used tarragon and a bit of mint (which is actually related to basil, so it was a pretty reasonable substitute). I also used a clove of fresh garlic plus 1/2 tsp sea salt, and instead of using dried onion, I minced about 1/4 tsp of the white part of a scallion. The wine gave this dish such a nice flavor. I forgot to use the lemon, but I don't think it needs it. This is a new favorite!

Ordinarily I like to grill salmon plain and add lemon at the table, but this marinated salmon is so much better, and my entire family loved it.

This recipe was very tasty and also easy to prepare.  I would add about 2 tsp. honey to the marinade to add a little bit of sweetness.  That will also add a nice carmel brown crunch to the exterior of the salmon.  The combination of herbs and spices is very tasty, and the salt is not missed at all.  This is a keeper for maximizing flavor compared to the time and effort needed to prepare it.

Good quick salmon recipe, but 30 minutes wasn't enough for the marinade.

This was my first time making salmon and the recipe seemed easy enough, only problem was I didn't have a grill so I looked around for more recipes and noticed that when baking salmon the average setting in 375-400 degrees. So I followed the recipe and elimated the basil and used fresh garlic, sprinkled some all-purpose seasoning on the salmon filet and stuck it in the oven for 20 mins at 400 degress and was amazed by how flavorful it was.  Will definitely add this into my dinner rotation

Yum! This recipe was easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to add 1 glove of garlic ( chopped finely) to the marinade.
