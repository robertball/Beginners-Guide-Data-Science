Some of you that said that these pancakes are rubbery and flat but they aren't!!! I'm ten and I made these without any adult help whatsoever and mine came out perfect and even better that on the picture. Just don't add any margarine or butter, only oil and cook on a medium high for about three minutes and then cook on medium for the rest of the time. I added poppy seeds because they make this recipe a little more healthy. 
In all these pancakes were absolutely great and very delicious! I also followed the amount of salt that the recipe said to add.

These are some of the best pancakes!  I would make 2 batches though if I were serving this to 4 or more people.

These were the worst pancakes i've ever had. They taste salty. I ended up throwing them out and making instant noodles for breakfast...will NEVER make them again.

Hello :)

My lil son and I just made these and they are okay. 
This mix is runny and the flavor is forgettable.
They are however, great in a pinch! :p

I usually make the recipe that is on the side of "Bobs Red Mill" all-purpose flour sack. They are fluffy and very tasty. The key ingredient in that recipe is yogurt (we use Nancy’s vanilla yogurt) and we are out.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe – it saved the day! :) :) :)

Not bad in a pinch when there is no Bisquick! These were a little rubbery and thin, but not bad when doctored up with chocolate chips, butter, and syrup.

This recipe was interesting to say the least.  The pancakes were like rubber and I had to cook them on med/high to get them to cook at all.  I added more flour so they were watery and a little more sugar as well to make them taste better.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.  Try a different one!

I tried this recipe on my students and did not get a great deal of good feedback.  The key to a tasty, fluffy pancake are simple ingredients and leavening agents. This particular recipe has way too many ingredients- vanilla, sugar, too many eggs. The baking soda is not a strong leavening agent and reacts with the sugar and extract (the alcohol in the extract) and although the pancakes fluff during cooking, they collapse when they cool. The amount of ingredients makes these pancakes heavy and rubbery. A simple recipe with flour, eggs, BAKING POWDER, a little salt and vegetable oil will give you light, fluffy pancakes that will please every time.

Excellent basic recipe; not too sweet which makes it great for tossing mini choc chips on top which my kids love.  I plan to add some wheat flour as well.  This is my standard recipe now; have made it 10+ times.

I needed to double this recipe to get five servings. I also added baking powder to make them fluffy. However, the vanilla extract is a great ingredient for their taste.

I thought this recipe was good. The vanilla was a surprising touch. Was looking for something different and quick dinner. This was it. Adjusted the salt. I never use what it called for. Cakes were not fluffy, but the taste was right on. Will make them again and experiment with the recipe.  Good starter recipe.

I ran out of mix, and it's a long time since I made pancakes from scratch. I wanted a simple recipe, and found this one. Should have read the reviews first. Where do I start? Too much salt, baking soda instead of baking powder, eggy taste, better without the vanilla, and too thin. I smothered them in maple syrup and ate them, but the rest of my family turned them down.

Must say, I've had better. These did not get fluffy at all. I added baking powder in hopes of getting fluffy, helped a little but I wouldn't try this recipe again. It just didn't satisfy my pancake craving.

Needed substitute for Krusteaz mix I usually use. This was as the name suggests, simple. Changes I made: I tripled the recipe, added 1/3 wheat flour and added a couple of tablespoons of flax seed meal for nutrition.  Flavor was good (Better than Krusteaz), but as others said, there was a noticeable greasy mouth-feel to the pancakes (similar to a diner pancake, not a turn off).  It is baking powder, not baking soda. The addition of softened margarine made for little pockets of buttery flavor in the finished pancakes, and made it so no butter was needed when eating them, and perhaps the cause of the greasy mouth-feel. All in all, satisfying, filling, simple and recommended.

I made these pancakes for the first time today.  My husband and I thought they were a little salty.  Other than that, I thought the pancakes tasted ok. I would suggest decreasing the salt to 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon.  This might improve the flavor of the pancakes.

I was in a rush this morning and needed a basic pancake recipe, saw this recipe and decided to try it as there are only the two of us and this recipe halved so easily.  Like others, I found the texture of these pancakes to be a little rubbery but the flavor is  good. I did not find the batter to be  runny.   I grind my own salt so eyeballed the amount, but I'm fairly certain that I used less than the specified amount, (probably about 1/4 teaspoon) as freshly ground salt can be "saltier" in flavor.  I was also surprised to see baking soda listed as an ingredient and wondered if it shouldn't be baking powder but followed the recipe as directed. Would I make these again?  Maybe. They are what they are, a simple pancake.

This recipe has too many "heavy" ingredients, and not enough baking powder to balance things out.  The result is a heavy, dense "pancake"...nothing light, fluffy at all with the outcome of this recipe.  I recently was given a whole wheat/oatmeal base for pancakes that support additives like whole, fresh blueberries and we've tossed this recipe aside now.  Flavor doesn't really stand out either w/this version.

I did not enjoy these pancakes. I was sad to waste my time and ingredients. I had to add flour for the right consistency and like the other posts it was very salty.

Too much baking soda makes these pancakes taste salty. Double the sugar and half the baking soda. Also, choose either butter or oil to add. Don't add both. I ended up having to add extra flour. The pancakes were greasy.

I was so disappointed in these pancakes.  Not only was the texture rubbery, but they left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth. Probably due to the baking soda.  I would not recommend these pancakes at all!

I'm only giving these pancakes 4 stars WITH modifications.  First of all they were rubbery, but I believe that's a result of using the baking soda instead of powder.  I made several modifications, instead of the oil and butter I substituted applesauce.  I added another 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tbsp of sugar (instead of a tsp), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and only a dash of salt.  They cooked really well (and fluffed up a bit) but the flavour was still a little bland.  Maybe I'll try adding some almond extract next time?  Definitely a "simple" recipe and you need to play with it to make it good.  Great in a pinch though!

These were just OK flavor wise.  The batter was very thin - more Like creps.  I used this recipe because I had forgotten to make the Yeast pancake batter the night before, and I didn't have enough Bisquick.  Though that little bit of bisquick saved this batter.  Was just enough to thicken it up the runny mess.

I printed this recipe out for my husband because it said easy pancakes. Becuase normal the only pancakes he makes are the ones that are just add water. We used wheat flour and splinda and they came out great. The whole loved them.

I did make some alterations: My husband has managed blood pressure so I just put a pinch of sea-salt and yes, it is baking powder (not baking soda). Then I put 1 cup of Carnation evaporated milk instead of regular milk. As a child, my grandmother made home-made pancakes; this was my first time making pancakes from scratch. I will never buy another box of pancake mix or go out to a restaurant for pancakes. The taste took me back to my grandmom's kitchen. So easy and economical; I was amazed how fluffy and delicious these pancakes came out.

I read a lot of the reviews and was puzzled by all the negatives. I made this recipe today for our Thanksgiving breakfast because I was out of Bisquick. I eliminated the vanilla but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I did not find them salty or greasy as some stated. The pancakes did not rise much but they were good tasting. I wonder if the reviewer that said possibly the soda should have, in fact, been baking power. I will try them again and try it with the baking powder. My husband is a real critic when it comes to pancakes, and even he said they were really good.

First thing wrong with this recipe is that there is no acidic component to work with the baking soda.  There should have been some baking powder and/or cream of tartar added.  There also seems to be too much liquid.  This led to the pancakes being very thin and very tough.  Sorry but this recipe is not a keeper.

OK. I am 24. I've never made pancakes myself before this recipe. I don't really care for pancakes. Although I don't think my husband would like these I LOVED them! I didn't have many ingredients and was looking for a quick easy recipe and this one did the trick. I was hungry for something I hadn't ate in a long time and this one was really good. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out very good. I cooked them on medium heat and the only difference was I used 1/3 C for pancake size, although I didn't quite fill it up to the top. I JUST ate it right out of the pan and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

The pancakes came out very rubbery and salty. I think there was too much baking soda and you could taste the saltyness from the baking soda. A pinch of salt is more than enough in this recipe.

If you like greasy spoon type of truck stop food, than this is a recipe for you! !! They were too runny and oily for a normal pancake hot skillet. Batter was more like waffle mix but they didn't fluff up either way. The only way I could get this recipe to work was to add 2X more flour, remove oil, and replace baking soda with baking powder.

Very simple and very easy to make.  The butter kept lumping for some reason, so I took the butter out altogether.  Not sure what I was doing wrong.  Other than that, they came out great.

I augmented this just a bit, and now it is the most heavenly thing I have ever tasted. I took bittersweet chocolate chunks, chopping them up smaller with a knife, and saving the chocolate dust. As you pour out 1/3 cup of batter, immedately pour a small handful of your broken chocolate chunks into the center of the batter. If you see bubbles rising, turn turn over the pancake carefully in 5 seconds! After that, heat  some maple syrup with ACTUAL BUTTER in a small dish. Pour on top, eat these delicious melty chocolate pancakes immediately, and cry happy tears.

As simple as a quick mix & a whole lot cheaper!  I added about 25% more flour as mix was a little to thin for me.  I also used whole wheat flour, natural sugar, & canola oil to make it a little bit healthier, something you'll have a hard time finding in a pancake mix from the store.

I took the recipe review advice and omitted the salt and added 1/2 cup flour to the recipe.
My advice is to cook on high and be patient.  This recipe IS a runny mess if you turn these pancakes too quickly.
They turned-out great!  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

These are just the right fluffiness and consistency. I had always relied upon mixes, and shopping through all the pancake recipes on 
"allrecipes.com," thought this was the best. Good job, Daniel!

a teaspoon of salt is too much. the batter is very thin. I added about 1/4 cup more flour. They tasted salty, but ok.

I'm 61 yrs old, and have been cooking, baking --- and making pancakes --- since high school.  For the last few decades, I have simply used mixes or Bisquick to make light and fluffy pancakes.  I know how to gently mix batters such as this so that they rise correctly.  I decided to try this recipe for supper tonight.  BIG mistake.  The comments about thin and rubbery are right on.

These pancakes were extremely easy to make. However they are not "light and Fluffy" i recommend using them as a dessert or in combination with some fruit as they are quite dense.

I love how easy and tasty this recipe is.  I make it often for Sunday breakfast.  My only modification is adding a half teaspoon of vanilla to mask any egg smell.

Not sure what the reason is for the negative reviews. I'm guessing they didn't follow directions correctly but, I thought thy tasted great. I added a little more flour because they seemed a little runny but other then that awesome. Thanks.

This is a very simple recipe, which is why I made it. The pancakes were fine as far as texture, but they tasted a lot like baking soda. I wonder if it is supposed to be baking powder instead? I will try that next time, thank you, Daniel for submitting your recipe.

These are not the best pancakes I have ever tried, but they work in a pinch. I added a bit of vinegar to the milk to make them a little more acidic so they'd react more with the baking soda. Also, I used oil instead of butter as the fat. Just because it's easier.

After mixing dry & wet ingredients separately I could tell if I put them together the mix would be too runny.So I ended up putting just enough of the wet mix to make the batter the consistency that I like and it made REALLY delicious pancakes.

This is a good, no-frills recipe.  I omitted the margarine, per previous reviews, and it turned out just fine.  I also doubled the recipe, as a review stated it was necessary for four or more people.  We had OCEANS of pancakes...good thing they freeze well!

I made these pretty fast because I ran out of Bisquick.  I thought they were more like a crepe.  They were sort of rubbery.  My Fiance loved them but he got the batch that just came off the griddle so they were hot. 
I prefer a fluffier recipe.

Very tasty and easy as promised.  I used whole wheat flour, added butter instead of margarine, and used a little less oil because I wrote the recipe down wrong.  These may very well be our new Saturday morning pancakes.

We just made these and didn't care for them. I had to add a ton more flour because it was so runny and it had zero flavor.  I added some cinnamon but even that didn't help.  And they had a consistancy like rubber.

Despite reviews, this turned out a lot better than I thought.  I always add cinnamon and vanilla to my pancakes, so they tasted just my style.  Granted, they were not very thick, but that was ok.  The only problem I had was the softened butter.  I used I can't believe it's not butter and it was all chunky in my batter.  I didn't see the point of the softened butter other than to make it more fattening.  Other than that, it was a good recipe.

I also added more flour , halved the salt, added 1 tsp. baking powder, doubled the sugar and used soy milk.  They turned out different than standard pancakes, but were completely enjoyable.  Adding cinamon also upped the flavour.

The pancakes were good, but they had a funny taste to them, slightly salty.  It wasn't overpowering or necessarily bad, just different.  I would suggest cutting the salt down and increasing the sugar a bit.  Overall, it was a good breakfast.

YAY! I love this kind of European style pancakes. RUBBERY IS GOOD! I'm pretty sure this is close to my mom's recipe without the margarine or sugar.My mom's were like a thick crepe, that didn't suck up all the butter/syrup...mmm. Although one of the pics shows thick fat pancakes (wth?) No, this is NOT the nasty fluffy pancakes. Try making them with soured milk. Try serving with butter and a simple sugar syrup instead of heavy strong flavors. I might cut back to a pinch of salt and backing soda, but can't wait to try them! Thank you!

I was looking for a recipe without baking powder(I was out of b.p.). This recipe turned out great. I set the butter aside and forgot to add it. Other then the butter, I followed the recipe on medium heat and they were great. They were not flat or rubbery. Thanks for the recipe!

a nice base recipe for pancakes that only calls for things I have on hand (I'm not the kind to keep buttermilk or wheatgerm in my pantry)  I like sweeter pancakes, so I'd double the sugar, and halve the salt.  Its also a very halvable or doubelable recpie depending on how many people you are feeding.

Flat and rubbery, it's true.  Had to add a lot more flour to achieve fluffiness.  Wouldn't reccomend.  Sorry :(

These weren't the best pancakes I've ever had by a longshot, but since they're made with stuff I almost always have on hand they'll do when you need a pancake fix.

Using medium heat the pancake got done on the outaide to fast, and was uncooke din the middle. turned heat down to low but it still cooked to fast on the outside and uncooked in the middle. I had to throw it all out because it was runny in the inside. Also, it was not fluffy at all, very flat and kind of chewy. The taste of it was very good, If I could find a way to cook them the whole way through I would make again.

Good basic recipe.  I added a 1/4 cup more flour because I thought the batter was a bit runny.  I also added chocolate milk in replacement of plain milk because my daughter likes chocolate pancakes.
