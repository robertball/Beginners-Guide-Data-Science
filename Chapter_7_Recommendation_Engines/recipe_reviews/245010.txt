Great recipe!! We didn't use onion or red pepper flakes because we had spicy Italian sausage (and it was spicy!). Will do again using sweet Italian sausage and hopefully it won't be as fire engine hot as this was.

This was so fast to make and I love how most ingredients were fresh! Kudos on not having a lot of processed ingredients! I omitted the salt, as I wanted the taste to come from the herbs. Other than that I followed the recipe. Yum yum!

This recipe is so good that I've hunted for 2 days to find it again. I'll be writing it down and adding it to my recipe box this time. I used smoked sausage because I already had it and left out the mushrooms because we aren't fans, but followed the rest to a T and the entire family ate it up! Quick, easy and delicious!

Delicious! I made it exactly as directed & served it both as sandwiches with potato salad and also over penne. Everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

A new family favorite! The only thing I did differently is leave out mushrooms--I hate  mushrooms. Great recipe!!

This was wonderful! I didn't have a green pepper so I used a yellow and I was out of tomato sauce so I used crushed, it made the dish really creamy. The pasta I undercooked by a few minutes and added it to the pan, after draining it, with everything else to soak up the sauce. Thanks for sharing.

My family devoured this!  We are not hot and spicy fans so I omitted the red pepper flakes.  I also used 2 tsp of minced garlic and no garlic salt.  I added 4 large handfuls of spinach, and a full 750ml jar of pasta sauce.  I also drained the diced tomatoes so it wasn't runny at all.  It was quick, easy and a new family favourite!

Fresh and tasty!  I used chicken sausage to cut down on the fat and it was still flavorful.  It made a big pot so we are looking forward to leftovers.
