As the recipe stands, it's a disaster - the flour is way out of proportion.  I made it according to the recipe and it's just too too thick.  I like raisin pie with a juicier filling.  I think there should be from 2-4 tabs. flour (or less) or 2 tabs. cornstarch.

HOWEVER, the flavoring is WONDERFUL. I will make it again but use way, way, way less flour.  If the person who submitted the recipe corrects the flour amount, this would be a ***** for flavor.

This recipe was wonderful, and citrisy. It really jazzed up the raisins, but the flour amount is way off. That amount of flour and water would make a glue. So I cut the flour to approx. 1 tablespoon.

Pie was awesome, I did add extra raisins and a couple tablespoons of white sugar. Top crust did not fall, and the juices and zest made it taste like my momâ€™s. Thank you for posting it.
