Chicken fricassee was often served at my grandmother's house during warmer weather.  She used to boil an old stew hen, pick the meat off the bones, strain the broth to reuse as a base for the gravy and go from there. Kind of a lot of work.  In that vein, I followed this lovely recipe with the following exceptions:  The thighs were cut into bite sized pieces, I added considerably more salt (don't know how much--just until it tasted good to me), and swapped out the water for chicken broth to heighten the flavor.  Served over hot biscuits slathered with butter.  Wonderful!  Thank you so much for a recipe that I will be making again!

Yummy!  I did make a couple of changes - instead of water I used chicken broth and I added a splash of white wine.  I agree with last reviewer that it made a lot of sauce.  We had it with rice.    I would probably make with less water (about half as much) next time.

Very Good.  Made lots of gravy, make sure to serve with mashed potatoes.  Followed the directions exactly except used Wondra instead of flour.

This dish was wonderful.  I found it to be packed with flavor.  I did make a few substitutions.  Instead of using water, I used chicken stock.  I also added some white wine to the chicken stock.  My husband loved it. I will definately be making this dish in the future.

This dish is a keeper! My husband loved it so much that he kept making "yummy sounds." The sauce has a delightful mushroom flavor. The kids don't care for onion, but I've found they don't mind if I use the dehydrated onion bits, so that's what I did. I also omitted the celery. They had to pick out the mushrooms. I used Campanelle pasta, which looks like little horns, to dress it up. I recommend removing the skin before browning.  This reduces the amount of fat in the sauce, plus I found the skin wanted to slide off after being cooked in the water.  My preference for thickening is corn starch, I tend to get lumps with flour. I poured the mushroom sauce over the pasta and placed the chicken on top for a lovely presentation.  I'll be making this again and again!

OMG...this was unbelievable!  I made it for my whole family (children included) and it was a bit hit!  I made 8 chicken thighs in total which required quite a bit more flour for breading the chicken and depending on how you like your gravy, thicker or thinner, you can add however much flour you see fit. I made this with mashed potatoes and the gravy was so wonderful on top of them!  A little time consuming to make, but worth it in the end!

This dish was wonderful!  I adjusted from the original recipe slightly...for 6 servings.  Since I didn't have dried thyme on hand, I substituted rosemary (love the flavor with chicken, so I figured it couldn't turn out bad!), and added 1 tsp. garlic powder to the flour mixture you coat the thighs in.  I didn't have a chardonnay on hand, either, so I used a dry riesling -- it turned out so delicious!  We served ours over pasta.  It was a perfect meal for a cold evening.  Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was good, but bland. I even altered it after reading the other reviews. I used chicken broth instead of water, added white pepper and a sprinkle of cinnamon; which I believe added some flavor. My husband really liked it and for once didn't go to the spice counter  for more seasoning after taking the first bite. My 2 year old liked it as well. But I think next time I'll try the traditional version of Chicken Fricassee.

Lots of gravey and I liked the vegetables but even with the addition of garlic and some chicken stock in place of water still very bland.  I probably won't make this again.

Awesome recipe!  I altered a bit, adding chicken broth instead of water and adding 3 cloves of garlic. I also added some chopped red bell pepper.  Turned out great!

This was overall a good recipe - though strangely I ended up with a very little amount of gravy - unlike everyone else! I only give it four stars though because it was a bit bland - it definitely needed some salt and pepper. I served it with mashed potatoes though, and my husband said it was good. I will make this again.

I made this this evening and it was very good, the gravy kind of tastes like swedish meatballs. As a matter of fact I will add more pepper and rosemary and use this for swedish meatballs.

I took the advice of other reviews and used chicken broth and garlic. Overall my family enjoyed this which is surprising since we are not big fans of thyme . I'm going to experiment with this more and not add thyme next time and see what happens.

This wasn't fancy, but it was good. It really hits the spot if you are craving comfort food. The only extra thing I did was add some garlic powder and a bit more salt and pepper. We will definitely have this again.

I guess I used too large of a pan because the sauce ended up burning I think because the pan was too large and shallow. The chicken also ended up a bit tough and dry, and I'm not sure if 30 minutes was too long, but I think again this may be because I used too large of a pan. If it were in a smaller pan, it would be fully immersed in the sauce to soak it up, it would have been perfect. Still I rescued it by pouring a lil extra chicken stock and a lil extra milk in with the flour for the gravy. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach. Not the most amazing dish in the world, but not terrible. Just need to cook it a bit differently next time.

This is a 5-star slam dunk dinner for me!! I did make a few modifications:  Instead of 2 whole chicken thighs, i used 4 boneless breasts, cut in strips and then just used more flour and seasonings to coat. I did not use celery because my boyfriend is not a fan and it was still fabulous.  I also substituted chicken stock for the water.. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.   Eating it now for lunch and it almost tastes better reheated!

I tried it and it was good but I did my own twist to it.  I used a whole cut up chicken, removed the skin and fat.  Put it in large skillet with lid, added celery, onion, mushrooms and then put a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom in it.  I then simmered it slow for a couple of hrs.  and served over boiled potatoes.

Really good!  I can't say that I would change much, but I don't agree that it made a lot of gravy.  In the end, I really didn't have much at all.

Excellent. This dish pleased my hubby so much, he gave me a big kiss after dinner!  He dubbed this "Make-up Chicken", coming in a close second to "Engagement Chicken." This is my new go-to dish after a spat.  I did tweak the recipe by adding a little Dijon mustard to the liquid. I was out of chicken stock and I thought the mustard would add some flavor.  And boy was that a good call.  Enjoy!

Excellent.  I did do a few things differently.  I wasn't paying attention and I went ahead and cooked the chicken until it was done during the browning phase.  Then I realized they were supposed to finish cooking in the water.  So, instead of putting the chicken back in the pan with the water, I added rice instead.  Then I removed the rice, onions, etc.  and cooked the gravy.  This was soooooo good!  Thank you!

This was so delicious. The sauce tasted like cream of mushroom soup, only much better. We used chicken breasts instead of thighs, they turned out really tender and yummy. We had it with rice to soak up all that creamy sauce.

A delicious way to spell C-H-I-C-K-E-N
This recipe stunned my family. It was so delicious that they requested it again the other day. I made a few modifications myself. I included celery in the recipe and replaced water with chicken stock. I omitted the white wine and it still tasted great! I’m used to checking out gourmetrecipe.com but this recipe made my visit to this site not bad at all. Thank you for sharing your recipe. You sure saved me from thinking a lot on what to serve for dinner.

Awesome, added some mined garlic to the onions and celery when I sauteed it and also some granulated garlic to the flour mixture that I breaded it with and also used chicken quarters instead of just thighs and used flour from the breading to add instead of just a new set of flour. Of course I didn't measure any of it b/c I never do when I cook, but a great recipe overall and that's why I saved it

A good go-to recipe for chicken.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and thickened the gravy with corn starch instead of flour.  I expect it would be wonderful over mashed potatoes.

This was an excellent recipe.  I took the advice of others and added garlic, seasoned salt, and pepper so that it wouldn't be bland.  I will definitely be making this again.

Too much work for an alright taste. I would add more salt on it at the end to bring out the flavors. I put mine over some angel hair pasta. Instead of chicken thighs, it would have been really easy to eat if they were little pieces of chicken. I'd completely skip the flour coating as well.

Wonderful chicken. I exchanged the butter for extra virgin olive oil. Left the mushrooms out because my husband doesn't like them. I added chicken bouillon because it seemed like it might be bland. Turned out great!

One to keep handy. We eat so much chicken at home, this is a very welcome addition to my chicken recipe cache. Made it just as described and it was perfectly delicious!

This recipe is awesome! I omitted the celery and added a little white wine with the water.

This quickly became one of our favorite recipes (within the first bite!). I did a touch more salt and pepper than the recipe called for and also used dried parsley, because it was all I had on hand. I served on top of canned biscuits with mashed potatoes and green beans on the side. All in all a great comfort dinner for a work night. Thank you for the recipe!

Won't do this one again.  Gravy was terrible.
