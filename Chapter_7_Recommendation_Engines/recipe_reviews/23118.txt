This was a great way to use up some home-made chili, so I used my own recipe and then topped the ziti with it.  I always add cinnamon to my chili, so I didn't find it unusual that this recipe called for it.  It was interesting that the same children that would not eat the chili in the bowl the night before, ate lots of it when it had noodles underneath.

Yuck!!  Too much of a cinnamon taste.  Imagine chili with cinnamon in it.  Will not make again.

Though I cheated a little (packaged chili spices), I did add the cinnamon.  WOW!  What a difference.  Will definitely try this again!

This is a great recipe to stretch your chili if you are serving it to a lot of people. I used a can of chili diced tomatoes and a can of chili beans in place of the tomato sauce and kindey beans. I didn't use the seasonings in this recipe, I used a chili seasoning from this site. Will use this recipe again!

I thought this was awesome!  I did not think the cinnamon overpowered it at all.  I do like cinnamon though.. the flavor was kind of sweet.  Yum!  I will make again and again!  Family loved too.

Excellent way to use up some leftover chili.  I used elbow macaroni and layered in more cheddar cheese.  Easy and tasty.

My husband loved this dish.  I just reduced the recipe and added more sauce instead of water. Excellent!

I like it a lot, though I do not make pasta with it, it is filling on its own! I add green beans, potatoes, carrots and some small pieces of brocoli. It is a good recipe! I love it!
