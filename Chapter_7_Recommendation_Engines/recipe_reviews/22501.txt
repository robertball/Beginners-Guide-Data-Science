I made these for Christmas last year and sent some to my boss, which he got days later.  They were still moist and chewy when he received the package.  He raved about how great they were and how hard they must have been to make (no need to contradict him).  These were very easy to make.  Do follow the recipe and take them off the baking sheet immediately, though, or you'll be scraping bits off at the sink forever.

I made these for a bake sale and they were the first thing to go, with people coming back for seconds. A big hit.
I baked mine on parchment paper which helped with not sticking to the pan.

The flavor was really good but I could not get them off the pan to save my life!  I tried immediately after taking them out of the oven, and they fell apart, so I waited about 30 seconds and by then they were bonded to the pan! I don't know what I did wrong!

Very easy to make.  Had a 'sweetened consensed milk' flavour, though.  I prefer the stovetop version of these cookies.

I followed the recipe and got great globs of muck on the pan.  I tried taking them off right away but they just ended up more of a mess.  With the next batch I waited before taking them off but by then they were molded to the pan.  They were quite good but not presentable.

I used chocolate flavored sweetened condensed milk and they were very good.

These aren't bad....just not what I was looking for.  They are super simple to make -- my 4 year-old did most of the work!

These were very popular at work.  I used a LOT of cooking spray and had no trouble getting them off the pan.

The cookies stuck to the the pan even when I removed them right away.  They didn't look that presentable to be giving away for my christmas cookies.  The taste was good, but just didn't look nice.
