This has potential, but I felt it was a little bland. It needed more seasoning, possibly some fresh garlic and more salt and pepper.

We just love squirrle in our family! It has become a Thanksgiving tradition.  My husband usually catches them fresh out of the yard.  Great way to save money .  Slow cooking in the crock pot over the fire works well for us!  Definitely cook the pototes until tender.

My dogs spend a lot of time trying to catch the squirrels in our backyard, but so far---no luck.  I guess I'll have to hang on to this recipe just in case......sounds mighty good!

I changed it up a little and it was fantastic.
I used 3 squirrels no cabbage or bell pepper, substituted pearls onions, added 2 cups of sliced white mushrooms, 2 cups chopped celery used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of red wine. Very Very Tasty!!! I also flash fried the squirrel in a pan with butter and garlic prior to putting in slow cooker

I used this recipe for some deer I had and it turned out perfectly. I just wish I had more deer so that I could make more. Hearty and filling, we managed to make the stew last almost a month. Discarded the bell pepper in favor of mushrooms.

I found this just ok. Maybe needed some spicing up. Next time I may add a little nutmeg to the pot. Husband and kids loved it so it probably will be going into my regular rotation.
