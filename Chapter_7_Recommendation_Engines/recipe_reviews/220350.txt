Sorry to say that I did not care for this. In retrospect, I would omit the soy sauce, use less fish sauce, more tamarind, no paprika, pepper flakes instead of the cayenne pepper, and balance the whole thing with some tomato paste - all of which makes it an entirely different dish though.  Will not be making this again.
