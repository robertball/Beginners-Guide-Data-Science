Fantastic and simple! Just make sure you serve them immediately.  I also make a vanilla ice cream to go with them and it was yummy.

I love making souffles. 
TIP: after filling the ramekin, fold a soft towel or use a pot holder, and bang the bottom of the mold on it. The mixture will fall to the bottom of the mold and allow for a better rise evenly. Then fill the mold to the top.
