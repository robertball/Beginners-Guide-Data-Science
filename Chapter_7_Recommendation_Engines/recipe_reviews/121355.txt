I served this cake at a St. Patty's Day party and everyone liked it. I took other reviewers advice and added about double the mint extract to the frosting and the chocolate topping. Also, I froze the cake before putting on the icing and froze it again to make sure the green frosting was hard before putting on the chocolate topping. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS! Otherwise, you may have one heck of a mess when try to spread each frosting.

I just made this cake for Christmas and it was a BIG hit.  We had families for dinner on both Christmas Eve day and Christmas day.  This cake recipe was large enough to feed both groups and still have some left over for my immediate family (which made our 18 year old son very happy!)  I was able to make it on December 23rd and it is still fresh and good today.  When making it, I followed the advice of two other reviewers... one for doubling the amount of peppermint extract in both frosting and chocolate topping layers and one for freezing the cake before frosting it, however, I did not freeze it long enough and still had some difficulty getting the frosting to spread without tearing up the top of the cake.  Will freeze it longer next time.  I stored the finished cake in the refrigerator but took it out before each meal, to warm to room temperature, so that the topping layer would not crack when cut.  I am a true-blue "chocoholic" so used a dark chocolate extra moist cake mix and replaced the 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips with 12 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I "sparkled" it up a bit for the holidays by placing a dollop of extra creamy whipped topping on the serving plate next to each piece of cake and then sprinkled the topping with peppermint dust leftover from making peppermint bark earlier in the week.  Judging by my families' comments, I will definitely be making this cake again!

OHHMYYGOSSHHH, can't say enough how awesome this cake is. I made it for my step-son's 18th bday party (he's a die hard mint chocolate fan). It came out wonderfully. I did however modify it slightly: used the chocolate cake recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder box- why mess with perfection? I baked them in 2- 9" round cake pans, did add 1/4teasp of peppermint ext. to the batter. After they cooled and I removed them from the pans I put them in the freezer. The frosting: I did double the frosting and changed 2 things, used milk instead of water and added 1/2 t of vanilla to give it a creamier flavor. The people who are doubling the peppermint must like the taste of toothpaste. It is all personal preferrence, but my advice is to taste it before you double it. Frost the cake with the mint frosting and freeze it before frosting with the chocolate layer (left that the same too). I then topped with green sugar crystals and froze again. This cake was out of this world, just wish the frosting didn't melt so quick, I may work on that to get a frosting that holds up to room temp heat (this does not). Overall 10 stars +++. Thank you Virginia for the recipe! I will be making this again and again.

I love this recipe.  I didn't freeze the cake between steps and it shows in the final chocolate layer but it still tastes very very good.  I used a recipe for chocolate cake instead of a package and I used semi-sweet chips (cause it was all I had) which worked beautifully.  Next time I'll freeze my cake for a bit before frosting it.  I'll definitely be making this again

This was very good!  I used "dark chocolate" as my cake mix.  I kept the butter measurements as called for and increased the mint extract for both the frosting and topping (doubled...almost tripled the amts).  Very yummy and moist.  Will definately make this again.  Can't wait to share this recipe with coworkers, friends and family.

Amazing! I was a little worried about other reviewers comparing the flavor to tooth paste but they were wrong! I bought high-quality peppermint extract and doubled it for both the green frosting and the chocolate shell for the top. Also, I doubled the green frosting completely. I used the recipe from this site called "too much chocolate cake" and baked in two round cake pans. Using this recipe meant I didn't have to freeze the cake before frosting. I DID freeze after the green frosting went on, then I spooned the chocolate glaze over the top letting it dribble down the sides. It looked beautiful with the green frosting peeking through. I topped with a pretty design of andes mint/chocolate candies. My recipe photo for this one was voted a favorite for the allrecipes.com site for the day!!! If you want gorgeous presentation along with a delicious treat, try this one!!

Wow!  This was great!  I doubled the mint and it definitely wasn't too overpowering.  I also appreciated the tip of freezing the cake before each layer.  I froze it for about an hour each time.  I couldn't imagine the mess that it would have made otherwise!

This was delicious!  Because of the other reviews saying that the cake fell apart when spreading the green frosting, instead of freezing the cake I just added about 2 tsp more water and it was the perfect consistency for spreading.  The taste was perfect, consistency perfect - definitely a repeat recipe!!  Thank you!

I made cupcakes with this recipe.  I doubled the frosting recipe because I had tons of cupcakes to frost.  Instead of mint flavoring, I used a tiny touch of mint oil and added 1 Tbsp of Creme de Menthe for light flavor.  It had no food coloring and tasted great!  Thanks for this recipe.  It was a hit.

I was eager to try this recipe based on its reviews and my love of mint chocolate.  But I was disappointed in the result.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.  I thought the whole thing had too much of a minty taste (I wonder if it would've been better to use mint extract instead of peppermint extract - not sure of the difference between the two).  I thought the frosting was too dense and the chocolate topping too rich.  It just didn't all go together.  We found ourselves just eating the chocolate cake part and threw much of the cake away.

Wonderful recipe. Followed recipe as written. Froze the cake before icing, when mixing the green icing I too thought it was too thick and was glad i froze the cake. When I looked at the recipe a second time I realized I added 1/2 a stick of butter instead if 1/2 a cup ( big difference ). After I added the other 1/2 of the stick (to measure 1/2 cup total, as recipe calls for) the icing was perfect and easy to spread. There was no need to freeze the cake to ice it if you be sure to use a whole stick of butter.  If you freeze the cake before you ice it then while you are in the process of icing it you will have to be FAST as the icing will firm up that much faster and could be hard to spread smoothly.

This cake is a wonderful treat! I must admit that I made too many modifications by doubling the frosting and icing, making it two layers, and adding mini-chips to the cake batter. My version was way too rich as a result (but a milk-chaser helped). Even though mine was very rich, the flavors are quite wonderful and if I scale back to the original recipe, I'm sure it will be terrific. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Absolutely delightful! I followed the advice of doubling the peppermint and it tasted just like an Andes mint. I made a four-layered cake and it turned out beautifully. Everyone has asked me for a copy of this recipe. Freezing the cakes and then allowing the frosting to set before adding the chocolate topping really helped. I will certainly make this cake again. And soon!

EXCELLENT!!  I used Duncan Hines devils food cake for the cake part.  I did double the mint extract and used milk rather than water for the mint layer.  I think that I added a bit too much powdered sugar ( I didnt measure it) and so I ended up ading an additional tbsp of milk.  The frosting was nice and fluffy and not dificult at all to spread.  I also chilled mine in the fridge for about 2 hours before frosting.  Also important I think to chill again after the mint and before the chocolate so that the chocolate topping doesnt melt the mint frosting.  Chill for a few hours and serve. SOOO YUMMM!!

I was displeased with this recipe, I followed instructions to a T, and the mint icing had pieces of confectioner's sugar that were unwilling to blend, and it was hard to get the chocolate melted and on the cake quick enough... the taste was OK but I was very disappointed.

This cake was a huge hit at our family birthday get-together, dubbed the York Peppermint Patty cake.  I followed the recipe w/ advice from several reviews, except that I made the cake from scratch (Perfectly Chocolate) then for grins & giggles, tossed about a cup of mini chips/ andes mint chips into the cake mix then baked in 2  layer pans.  I also increased the creme de mint extract,  definitely freeze before frosting w/ green, then again before coating w/ chocolate.  It was both delicious & a gorgeous presentation.  Thanks for sharing!

I modified this recipe so much, but I think it still counts hahaha. In summary, I made Andres mint cupcakes with "too much chocolate" cake and Andres mints instead of plain chocolate in both cake and topping, side-stepping the peppermint extract dosage issues. The Andres mints within the cake add nice green mint speckles too.

 First I used the Too Much Chocolate box cake version using fat free sour cream, 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites to cut down the richness a bit, and Most Importantly I used chopped Andres mints instead of chocolate chips. Picture posted.

After baking, I cooled them. I was short on time, so I totally skipped the frosting, though I think that could add festivity for sure. 

Because I went straight to topping, non-frozen was fine. I substituted the milk choc chips for Andres mints again, side-stepping the entire peppermint extract business. On top of the chocolate shell I added some chopped Andres mints for decoration.

My audience was easy: a houseful of college frat boys, but everyone loved them including myself :)

This cake was delicious!  I took the suggestion of others and added a little more mint extract than the recipe called for and it was perfect.  Because the cake is rich, it lasted for days and days (most cakes are gone within 24 hours in our house).  I'm making it for an upcoming party and I have no doubt it will be a hit.

I used the frosting and topping in this recipe for my husband's birthday. I made the cake by layering mint brownie, caramel, crushed oreos, mint ice cream, another layer of mint brownie, then the mint frosting, and lastly mint chocolate topping.  AMAZING!!!!  Thanks

Amazing recipe!! I used the extreme chocolate cake in a 13x9 for the bottom, used mint extract (tripled in both frosting and topping), and followed the advice to freeze before every step. I came across no problems, and each step was easy.

Total hit with my son who loves chocolate mint. I made it for his birthday. I did double the mint cream but added a bit of heavy cream to the chocolate topping to make it creamier. I also doubled the mint (i used it instead of peppermint) like the other post suggested. They loved it!

My son wanted a chocolate mint cake for his birthday, and this was great!  I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe instead of a mix, and I didn't add the peppermint extract to the chocolate.  My mother-in-law uses the same frosting on chocolate brownies and calls them "Grasshopper Bars" -- in my opinion, the frosting pairs even better with brownies than with cake.

Delicious cake!! I made a 9" round double layer cake. Made twice the amount of buttercream frosting using twice the amount of peppermint extract per many reviewers' advice. Used about 1 1/2 times the peppermint extract in the chocolate topping. My family really enjoyed this dessert.

Super Easy to make very pretty and taste like an Andes Mint.   I did double the mint as was suggested by others in both the frosting and topping.    I also let my cake sit in the fridge for about 2 hours between each step.  I allowed the cake to cool on the counter for about 35 minutes and then I placed it in the fridge for about 2 hours.  I removed and Frosted the cake and placed it back in the fridge for at least two hours if not more before adding the melted chocolate topping.  I then again placed it back in the fridge prior to serving to allow the topping to harden.  Great Recipe.   Great Reviews from the guests at the party.

This was a really good cake.  I put a little extra extract in the frosting and icing layer.  I definitely should have at least doubled it.  Since I made it in a 10x15 pan, there was less than 1/4" of the green frosting.  Next time I'll double the frosting.  The chocolate chip icing layer was more like a glaze--just enough to cover the green.  I made this for a party and was running late.  From the time I walked in the door until I left for the party was only one hour. While the cake was in the oven, I made the two top layers.  After the cake cooled about 5 minutes, I put it in the freezer about 5 minutes.  Then,spread the green layer and back to the freezer for 5 minutes.  Definitely would have been easier if it had cooled more.  Then, the icing layer.  It was easier to spread the icing because the cake was cold and the icing had cooled to room temperature. I dropped the icing by tablespoon on the cake. Then, spread it over the cake.

Turned out very yummy.  I doubled the icing as others suggested and it was just the right amount.  I had a hard time icing the cake because the icing was so thick and I didn't freeze my cake.  I just heated the icing knife with hot water a few time to get a smoother look for the icing.  I also changed it by adding crushed oreo cookies crumbs to the sides.  Very good!

I made this vegan by using egg replacer in my cake mix, and vegan "butter" to make the frosting, and vegan dark chocolate chips for the topping.  Oh My Goodness!  I renamed this Death by Mint Chocolate Deliciousness!  It was SO rich and delicious!  my family absolutely loved it and there were NO leftovers!  So yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!  it's staying in my cook book forever!

Although my cake did not look as appealing as the one pictured, this was an exceptionally good recipe.  I used a dark chocolate cake mix.   I found I needed to double the recipe for the green mint frosting, and I barely had enough of the chocolate chip frosting to cover the cake.  Regardless, the cake was a big hit, and it will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth!!

I made half a recipe and used a Jiffy brownie mix for the cake part, which I baked in an 8-inch square pan. They came out great. I used the exact amount of mint extract as called for. If you use too much mint extract, stuff tastes like mouthwash.

Almost exactly like my mom's! She uses mint extract instead of peppermint. I like hers more, but it's not a huge difference. Also, I doubled the frosting. I like a nice thick frosting layer. Yum!!!

I wish I would have read the reviews prior to making this cake. I ended up doubling the green icing because it was difficult to spread the green icing on the cake. I kept getting "crumbles". Next time, I will add more water to the green icing recipe to make the consistency such so it is easier to spread. Regardless, the cake was delicious and everyone in my family loved it. It was also easy to make and quick. My girls decorated the top with sprinkles for a festive look.

Made this for hubby's birthday and he really liked it a lot. He is a HUGE grasshopper cake fan and this is the closest recipe I could find. I'm not a big mint/chocolate fan but he is so I sucked it up and ate and piece and boy was a surprised! YUM! Some said they thought it tasted like toothpaste and I was worried, BUT I don't think it had that flavor at all!

I don't usually rate recipes, but Oh my goodness! This is the BEST! It is my husbands favorite cake now. I use to make him an italian rum cake for his birthday, but for the past 2 yrs. this is what he asks for! I do a layer cake out of this and I make my own homemade chocolate cake. This cake is a winner!

I did like the rest of the reviews stated by doubling the extract.  I also made the cake and froze it over night. It was very easy to spread the frosting. This cake was okay. I love mint and chocolate together but I just didn't love it.

Recipe did not include enough water in mint layer so that icing was difficult to spread and pulled the top of the cake away.  I had to add milk and confectioners sugar in order to get the chocolate layer soft enough to spread.  Don't know what I did wrong, but this cake did not turn out as expected.

My husband made this cake for my birthday and it was wonderful! It was the first cake he had ever made in his 35 years of living. I guess that means the recipe is great for beginners. His cake was not as pretty as the photo, with thick layers of mint and chocolate frosting, but the flavors were all there. I plan to try this recipe myself soon.

It tastes good, but the frosting wasn't thick enough. I had waited almost half of a day for the cake to cool enough, and had kept it in the fridge the entire time. When I put the frosting on, it was kind of just like minty water. I followed the directions exactly and the frosting was incredibly runny.

This reciepe is great.  I had to make it for more than the reciepe called for so when I did the topping I did the reccomended about of Chocolate Chips and then instead of doubling the chips I decided I would break up a dark choclate bar and melt it with the chips.  The result was great.  I would definately recommend this to anyone.  It is also a very quick reciepe.  It only took me about and hour to make...baking time and all.

Excellent! I made this cake for my brother's birthday! He loves mint chocolate, and this cake was fantastic. For the cake, I used Hershey's cocoa recipe that is found on the cocoa box- it is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made (and I have made alot of cakes), and I also doubled all the mint extracts, as the other reviewers suggested. I did not put the cake in the freezer between layers because I didn't have the time, and had no trouble icing the cake. It looked fantastic! My brother and the family loved the recipe, and I will be making it again.

Sadly these tasted like am incredibly potent chocolate candycane.  I was curious as to why these are called mint brownies and are colored green when the recipe calls for peppermint extract?  I used only the 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract in the frosting and none in the topping and it was still overpowering and just plain bad.  We all ended up scraping the green frosting off and just eating the cake :(  I did take the advice of one user and used the Hershey's classic chocolate cake recipe for the first time and will forever use that as my chocolate cake because it was so deliciously moist.  At least something good did come out of this recipe. It was a great idea though.

Mine did not turn out looking nearly as pretty as the featured picture, but it did taste pretty darn good! I found that it tasted way better the next day after being in the fridge. I froze the cake layer overnight before frosting so that I wouldn't rip the top up. I don't know if it was because it was overkill with freezing the cake portion overnight, or because I am just not a cake decorating kind of gal, but the cake top still ripped up some for me. Sigh. I doubled the mint in the top two layers and it was nice and mint-chocolatey, not mint overkill by any means.

So GOOD! I'm not a huge mint person but I was making this for my friend's birthday (she is obsessed with mint choc chip ice cream) and I found myself eating spoonfuls of the mint filling. So fluffy and just the right amount of mint. As a whole..awesome.

My coworkers request this cake often, as they are all to afraid to try making frosting on their own.  But it couldn't be easier!  I usually bake this in a 9x13 pan.  There is no need to freeze the cake before frosting at this size, as there is the perfect amount of the mint frosting.  (There is a little too much of the chocolate glaze, but no worries- tastes great right out of the bowl!)  I have tried it in the bigger pan, and it was much more difficult to spread the frosting.  Very easy in the 9x13!!!

I followed some of the other users changes.  It taste good, but I would not say it is easy since you have to keep freezing the cakes between layers and getting the top layer on was a bit of a challenge.  But if you like Andes candies you will love this dessert

DELICIOUS and I'm not a big mint person!  I made this in a 13x9 pan.  I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and froze the cake in between steps.  It didn't look like enough mint frosting, so I doubled it.  The chocolate topping didn't look like enough either so I mixed in half a container of store brought chocolate frosting.  I made this for a St. Patrick's Day family dinner and everyone really liked it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'll admit I was a little skeptical as to how this would turn out, but I had people asking me for the recipe. Go by taste when adding mint extract, I ended up using a bit more than called for in the recipe. I also used semisweet chips. A good, popular cake.

This cake was easy enough to make.  I automatically took the other reviewers suggestions about freezing in between steps, which only needed about 20-30 minutes each.  And about doubling the extract amount.  The cake looked nice when it was done, I did mine in a round springform and used a homemade cake recipe.  I topped it with whipped cream swirls and Junior Mint candies.  However, the cake was so sweet, I could only handle about 2 bites.  The combination of the two frostings is way too much.  I will probably not make this cake again unless making major adjustments to it.

Great cake recipe! It is a nice refreshing cake for summer time as well. I also doubled the mint & it was perfect. Mother in law gave it 2 thumbs up!
