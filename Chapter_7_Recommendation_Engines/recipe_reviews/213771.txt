Great basic instructions!  There definitely is a difference between hard-cooked and hard-boiled.  I used this method for pickled eggs.  After I drained them (whether hard-cooked or hard-boiled) I submerge them in ice water.  I've never had the awful green ring by doing this and they're easy to peel.

This method worked out perfectly.  i have tried it a couple of times and wouldn't do it any other way!  This time I used only 3 eggs because that is all I needed for the recipe that i way doing.  it should work for any amount of eggs!  just be sure that they aren't too crowded in the pan.

I've been cooking eggs the wrong way for a very long time!  I'm so glad I came across these instructions.  The eggs turned out beautifully and no green ring.  I let the large eggs sit in the hot water for 16 minutes (I was a little nervous) and they were thoroughly cooked and wonderfully tender!

Although I've been making hard cooked eggs for many years, I was glad to find this info. as a refresher.  Lately I've had "hard to peel" eggs and this info. was worth the reading to find out why!  Funny how "stuff" we think we already know can be refreshed - thanks!

Super easy and they came out perfect. No gray stuff on the yolks which looks ugly.

Perfect. I didn't actually let them come to a full boil, but if I had they would have been perfect. I posted a picture of my slightly undercooked eggs. They still worked well for making deviled eggs, though.

The way I've been doing these for many years is, put eggs in cold water, bring just to the boiling point, then turn to just below simmer and simmer for 20 minutes, cool under cold water.

I've used this recipe a few times for hard-cooked eggs for a simple snack or to top salads or potato salads. Sometimes the shells stick sometimes they don't.
