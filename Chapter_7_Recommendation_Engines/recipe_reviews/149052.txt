This recipe is absolutely delicious.  The BEST fish tacos my husband and I have ever had, hands down...and we made them ourselves!!  Do yourself a favor and give this one a try.  And do follow the recipe to a "T"...use the Panko bread crumbs as they fry up so much nicer than regular bread crumbs.  Also, some reviewers admitted to omitting the chipotle  peppers in adobo sauce, but this ingredient is what makes chipotle mayo just that, so you musn't dismiss it!  You can find small cans of these in the Latino food section of any major grocery store.  The Panko crumbs can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store.  The coleslaw that goes with the tacos is worthy enough to stand alone.  I can't say enough about these tacos...just try them!  You'll be shocked you could make something so different and delicious in your own kitchen.

These fish tacos are excellent.  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT skip the chipotle mayo... that is what makes this recipe so great.  I am not a huge spicy food fan, I can usually handle a medium spiciness in foods, so I halved the cayenne pepper and the mayo was perfect, I could have licked it out of the bowl!!  I have made this twice, once with the fried tilapia, and once with grilled tilapia that was marinated the same way but not breaded (to try and make it a little healthier), and both ways were absolutely delish.  This recipe seems like a lot of ingredients and steps, but it is really quite easy.  Definitely give it a try!!

Just finished eating 2 of these, very good. I used wheat Ritz crackers instead of the panko crumbs just cause I had them. I also baked the fish in the oven on a pan coated with olive oil. Still crisped up very nice. I will make these again, thanks for the great recipe!

WOW - seriously the single best recipe I've tried to date, and I use this site for all of my recipes.  I don't love spicy (and neither does hubby) so for the mayo we used one pepper with a little of the adobo and left out the cayene and it was perfect.  My husband said best meal of the year!  I'm still drooling over them!  I added chopped tomatoes instead of a salsa and it was super.

These would be great too if you substituted the coleslaw mix with jicama.

My family loved this recipe.  I never fry foods but I thought I would try it out!  It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be!  My husband really loved the slaw, it has a really heavy cilantro taste, which he loves, so if you don't love cilantro you might wanna cut back.  Since other reviewers said that it was spicy, I cut open the chipotles and deseeded them.  I also halfed the cumin and just added a couple of dashes of cayenne.  I will be making this again!  They all loved it!  Thanks again!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of fish cooking method (I grilled on the stovetop) and only marinated the fish for 15-minutes.  I wasn't impressed with the final product.  The recipe name is also misleading as the "slaw" does not include honey or cumin.  I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

We really liked this. Great flavor and texture. The panko was a perfect coating for the fish. I did make some changes because this was a last minute thing and I didnt want to run to the store to get the extra ingredients. I used lemon juice in place of lime, subbed romaine lettuce for cabbage, and omitted the chilis because I didnt have any on hand. It was still great and we will be making this again. The recipe looks complicated, but its actually really easy and only took 20 minutes to throw together from start to finish. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We make it consistently.  We have substituted other white fish in place of the tilapia and it still turns out wonderfully.

That slaw OMG just makes this recipe.  I must say I cheated.  I was looking for a quick easy recipe soooo... I used frozen fish sticks ::gasp::  but it was sooo good.  I used good quality fish sticks (Gordons white meat talapia). I brushed them with the honey lime sauce before putting them in the oven.  I topped them with the slaw mix & some Mexican blend shredded cheese.  The only change I made to the slaw was adding more chipotles as I like my sauce a bit hotter.  My frozen fish stick tacos were delicious & so easy!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

These are fabulous! IMO the only time consuming part would be the fish, so just use whatever fish you want. I use a battered halibut from Trader Joes that I find tasty. While it's cooking in the oven I whip up the sauces and then brush the fish with the cumin sauce when it's done. The entire family found these delicious and I will be making these often! Oh yeah, I like to add a little drizzle of honey into the chipotle coleslaw also, the slight sweetness really brings all the flavors together.**UPDATE**I make this all the time and I no longer use any oil in the lime/cumin sauce; you don't need it! I also now use 1/4 c of mayo and 1/4 c of plain nonfat yogurt for the adobo sauce. Tastes just as good, but a little healthier for you.

These were just ok for me.  The mayo was way too spicy for my taste, one pepper would've been plenty.  If I make these again I'll probably omit the lime sauce and maybe just put the cumin in the flour coating.

Oh these were fantastic even though I screwed up a bit. I had a hard time following the directions so I put the marinade on the coleslaw and then I figured out I did it wrong, so I drained it off and put the mayo dressing on. It was a very happy accident, cuz it was GREAT slaw though. The only other change I made was to double the mayo and skip the cayenne and reduce the chipotle dramatically cuz we are wimps:) I think this would work well with any mild flaky fish. I also plan to do it with shrimp. Another tip is to assemble all the components earlier in the day so you can "throw" it together when dinner time come around. It is a bit labor intensive, but so worth the work. This will rotate into my menu on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: We still love this recipe. The only caveat I would add is that the prep time is underestimated by quite a bit. I would just suggest that you prepare all the components early in the day so you can enjoy a timely dinner. Love it!

YUM, YUM, YUM! I was also one that cheated and used fish sticks, but they worked out nicely in this. I made all the components, but chose to use them differently than stated in the recipe...I made the honey-cumin-lime sauce and used that as a dressing for the slaw mixture (also adding in some very finely sliced red onion). I made the chipotle mayo, but used that as a 'taco sauce' to top the tacos w/ like you would sour cream...YUM! I do think that 1 pepper would be enough in the mayo, but that's my personal preference. These worked out so well that I will definately be making these again (with my changes), and would like to try it w/ the talapia too! Thanks for sharing. :)

This sounded wonderful. And maybe it was. But I couldn't tell... it was so SPICY. There are sure a lot of 5 star ratings.  Maybe there are different levels of spiciness in canned Chipoltes in Adobe...  kind of like salsas.  We like medium-spicy, but  this was waayyyy too hot for us.

I hate that I did not follow the recipe, but my review is for the mayo mix and coleslaw. They are outstanding!!  The perfect compliment to fish tacos.   The only changes I made to the mayo mix was to add a squirt of lime juice and added some smoked paprika insteAD of the cayenne.  This was perfect for our tacos ( I decided to bake my talipa with a mix of cumin, old bay, and garlic salt.).  Very good served on corn tortillas that I sprayed with conola oil and let them get pliable..  Can't wait to do again. Hubby said he wants these once a week!!

Very tasty!  Made the slaw and mayo as directed and enjoyed it with both peppers in.    Hint on those who wanted healthier options:  Greek yogurt sub for the yogurt.  It's more tangy.  I also prepared the panko tilapia and baked for 25 minutes at 400 in an olive oil coated pan.    Served with some plain steamed carrots and a bubbly flavored water.  Really refreshing.

Due to dietary restrictions, I couldn't use battered fish. I also ended up using salmon. I thought it was pretty tasty. The cumin/lime mixture put it off for me a bit though. The is a chipotle mayo recipe on this site that I have used for BLTs before and it makes the best BLT! I thought it worked well for tacos too. Again, due to dietary restrictions, I had to use corn tortillas rather than flour. I heat up the tortillas a bit with a touch of oil (in a pan on the stove) to make them pliable and they worked out well. The slaw was also very nice! Great ideas, I just might leave out the cumin next time, and try with some shrimp! UPDATE: Tried is with shrimp and it was much better!

Looking to save some calories? suggestion 1: Skip the breading, the fish will still be good! if you like crunchy fish though, keep the breading or do half with and half without. Suggestion 2: Skip the Chipotle mayo, double the honey lime sauce and when it comes time to make the slaw mix a small amount of mayo with the remaining honey lime and add a little ground cayenne pepper. For the taco set up I made up a little spicy fat free sour cream (franks red hot and sour cream.) No body at the dinner knew I was saving them calories, it was so yummy this way!

The 3 stars are based on the recipe "as-is". My version is more of a 4 1/2 star outcome. The reason is because there is something off about the directions for this recipe. In my opinion, the cabbage should be tossed with the honey-cumin dressing--not the mayo--and the mayo should be used to top the fish once placed in the tortilla. This recipe suggested brushing the fish with the honey-cumin dressing, which I thought was odd given it was breaded and fried.  Also, as a short cut, I use frozen Tortilla Crusted Tilapia by Sea Suisine (any similar kind/brand would do). You just pop it in the oven and bake it and there's no messy cleanup or horrible fried fish smell in your home afterward.  The only other change I make is I use one chipotle instead of two. We just like a bit of zing, not a mouthful of fire, so I'm a little bit conservative when it comes to peppers...

I have made this twice now. The first time was for a party. Lets just say they were the hit of the party. Then I made them again. Just for two. This time I really got to enjoy them. The only change I made was minor. We added some tortilla chips to give it a little crunch. And I highly recommend flour over corn tortilla's. If I could rate this higher I would.

Made exactly according to directions.  Too much Chipotle and Adobo.  The spice out weighed the fish and was a little too saucy.  The Cumin/Lime sauce was pleasant on the fish.  If I were to make this again I would use maybe one chipotle pepper and completely skip the adobo sauce.  Overal I wasn't impressed enough to try making it again with revisions, I am going to look for a milder recipe that does not overwhelm, but enhances the flavor of the fish.

The flavor in this dish is amazing, just the right balance of spice, cilantro and chipotle.  My husband said, "this is your Mona Lisa" of all dishes.  I guess I'll save this recipe.   (I substituted Mahi Mahi for the Tilapia.)

WOW!!!  A symphony of flavors in my mouth.  First you catch the crispy of the fish (I baked it instead of frying it)...then comes the fresh lime and honey...and the kick of the chipotle at the end.  SO GOOD!!!  It stimulates all the parts of your taste buds...sweet, spicy, sour, salty, crispy, soft, etc.  I'll definitely make this again...I didn't change anything about the ingredients...just changed the frying part.

The slaw and the mayo were great!  The mayo was a little too spicy, next time I will only use one chipotle pepper and maybe half as much of the adobo sauce.  I grilled the fish instead of breading/frying it to cut down the calories a bit.

I LOVED this dish, despite not being a big fish eater.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were fantastic.  Components of this recipe (the chipotle slaw, the honey-cumin dressing) can be used in countless ways.  I will be making these again and again!

We prefer to fry the fish filets whole rather than cutting them up. It's faster than fryin multiple small pieces. Taste is good, younger children might find it too spicy. We put in half of the chilli's.

Great recipe. I skipped the step where you bread the fish and just grilled it, brushing it with the honey-cumin sauce once it was cooked. If you are less tolerant of spicy foods, you may want to only use one adobo chili in the mayo sauce as it is a very spicy sauce. I added a little greek yogurt to help make it a bit milder, but still it was spicy. My husband said they were the best fish tacos he'd ever eaten, and I am making them again tonight, the second time in a week! Thanks for sharing.

the one to go to, use marinade and dressing from grilled fish tacos, use this for cooking method and slaw, omit the honey cumin dressing.

These were good but not great.  I really wanted to like it because of the rave reviews.  Kudos to the inventor for it is a creative dish with lots of flavors.  I wasn't crazy about the mayo so I made it according to the directions first and then added 4 oz of sour cream.  This seemed to "lighten" it up a bit.  It is unclear where the cilantro/cumin mixture goes, so I spooned it on top of the fish.  Not sure if I will make again.

Major hit at my house.  Used fried halibut and drizzled the honey cumin sauce onto the fish when serving.  Will definately have this one again.  Love the Chipotle Mayo with it.
Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  I've made this three times and each time they came out perfect.  The only changes I made:  I omitted the cayenne pepper from the chipotle mayo (already plenty spicy with great flavor) and added about 1/2 tsp dijon mustard to the honey/lime/cumin drizzle to act as a light emulsifier.  Everyone who has tried these tacos has demanded the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Don't laugh...I totally cheated on this one because I was trying to appease my 6 year old!  I used fish sticks instead of preparing the fish. (I thought I could convince her she would like it if she understood it was made with something she already liked)  It worked!

Oh my, this was good. Fish tacos are one of my favs, and this is the one for us. Loved the adobo sauce.  My son askes for this one now.  Even when I'm trying to save on calories and just grill the fish instead of breading it, the adobo sauce is a must.   Thanks so much.  I already have made this many times.

I ate so much my tummy hurts! 

I used ono because I don't eat farm raised tilapia for health reasons.  

My daughter said it was too limey for her tastes.  I think I would skip the honey cumin lime glaze at least on her piece next time.

For me it was perfect!

5 stars! we fish for Halibut, so used Halibut in small pieces (taco size) Fry quickly, as Halibut cooks fast!!!. My kids helped me make it as we LOVE FIsh Tacos! Used less Chipolte in the sauce, as they arent fond of spice.l... but IF you LIKE SPICE use whatever you like! we put Yogurt in also for the Mayo sauce with the Mayo. Its a recipie you can DO TO TASTE,,,  did use Pampered Chef along with the lime on the HALIBUT, the Thai spice, to season. SO GOOD!! Used RAW Honey on the other sauce,,, Napa cabbage was in the store, loved it! Kids 11, 2 of them and our 8 y/o LOVED THEM. Thanks for a Great IDEA!!!  will use this Again, and Again!!!

My husband said this was the best thing I have ever cooked! We have been married 16 years and I am a good cook. So this was a winning recipe. I made exactly as directed the first time. The second time, I cut the fish into strips. It was much easier to batter. Less work. I also used burrito size tortillas, stuffed, rolled and then cut in half. I also doubled the lime sauce mix. This will go in our regular rotation!

These tacos are AMAZING! I added a slice of avocado to each taco and it was delicious! I didnt have chipotle peppers or adobo sause, so I used serracha hot sauce (the japanese orange hot sauce) and it worked just great to add that heat. Again, AMAZING dish!

My family raved over these tonight! Soooo gooood! I'm not even a huge fan of fish and even I adored them.

I didn't use adobo sauce, or cayenne pepper or chipotle chilies. Instead I used about 1/4 tsp of Mc Cormick Chipotle  Chili Pepper seasoning and about 6 drops of "Tabasco Green Chili Sauce" (the one in the green bottle) and that is the only spices I used besides the Cumin and Salt and Pepper. I just can't take much heat. 

My husband doesn't like cilantro, so I omitted that. We used corn tortillas instead of flour ones and I think it really added to the flavor. 

Tip: before you start this recipe, get all the measuring cups, spoons, plates, bowls, ingredients out, etc. before starting to make this recipe, or it'll take twice as long as it should. (A mistake I made tonight!)

My sister said, "some of the best fish tacos I've ever had."  I didn't bread the fish just cooked it in a pan with the honey-cumin sauce.  I was out of lime juice too so I used lemon juice.  Still so good.

Amazing! We loved this! I did not use adobo peppers as I had made my own sauce yesterday for a pozole so i used that instead. I added cubed Avocado into the slaw and it was so so good! I am not a big fan of wraps so i ate mine as a salad with the slaw on bottom and fish on top! It was to die for! 5 Stars!

This is the second time I've made this and it was just as good as the first time. I did want to comment that there was a ton of bread crumbs left over and I think 1 cup should be enough.  We threw out over half of the 2 cups of breadcrumbs it called for. Otherwise a great recipe!

This was really good!  I had never had fish tacos, and decided I was going to make these to try for fun!  I'm so glad I did!  I use cod, it was all I had on hand, and it was still wonderful.  Next time I will only use one chipotle pepper in the mayo mix, and only enough adobo sauce to taste.  I also drizzled a little honey into the slaw, to give it a little sweetness.  The extra honey-cumin dressing was drizzled down the whole taco to finish it.  Very Good!!  I can't wait to make these again!

I'm normally not a big fan of changing recipes too much but I made a couple changes in order to make it a bit more on the healthy side.   I ended up grilling the fish versus frying it and used Mahi Mahi because I had it in the freezer. I also decided to use the honey lime cumin dressing on the slaw and toss that together since I really like the lime flavor. I did hold back on cumin because I'm not a big fan of too much of it.   I also decided to use corn torillas and non-fat plain yogurt instead of the mayonnaise. It was pretty tasty, with a side of home made guacamole.

I mixed the lime juice, honey, oil and cumin together added some salt poured some out for "dipping" sauce and then poured some over the fish. Did not let fish sit for four hours; forgot to. I just eye-balled the mayo for slaw; fried the fish in a simple flour batter then served the fish slow and sauce in flour tortillas. Hubby and I both really liked it. Will make again.

Quite a bit of lime!  These were spicy too.  Good overall.  My husband LOVED them and he does not like "Mexican" food.  He's Filipino.

Awesome recipe. The chipotle mayo was a little hot, and I used catfish instead of tilapia. But it was a hit!

I might be the first one here to admit that I did not use the cumin sauce. After making it, I thought it would overpower the dish, so  left it out. The merinated fish in lime juice made the final product so refreshingly tasty. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and was IN LOVE with this dish! Oh, actually, I did stray from the recipe a little more now that I think about it. I used corn instead of flour tortillas (more authentic). Of course, I also added fresh avocado slices to each taco. So AMAZING!I will make this forever.

WOW!  Absolutely delicious.  We only made two changes.  We reduced the marinade time to two hours 
and substituted agave nectar for the honey.  This is worth doubling and making for friends.  Definitely will make again!!

The chipotle mayo was great, which MADE the tacos.  I didnt care so much about the honey lime cumin mixture brushed on the fish.  I will definatly make the mayo again when making fish tacos, but I'll probably just season the fish a different way next time.

Been making this for awhile now - it's amazing. To cut down the calories I use light mayo and either tortilla crusted frozen tilapia or regular unbreaded tilapia loins from Costco and bake them after I've drizzled the honey sauce on them.  If the kids are eating I pare down to one chipotle pepper. Super great, versatile and quick if you use premade fish fillets. Guests frequently request this.

The recipe was somewhat confusing. I mixed half of the chipotle mayo with the honey cumin dressing and tossed the slaw with it. It turned out great! Loved the crunchy fish and the chipotle mayo was perfect...loved the spice!

I only made the slaw and I doubled the recipe. MMMMM 6 cups of red and green cabbage, 2 cups of cilantro. I just used the leaves and stems of the cilantro so I didn't have to go buy more. Excellent. I served it with homemade shrimp tacos.

Great crunch to the fish with a nice hint of lime. The spicy slaw was to much for me and I only used 1 chili. Next time I only plan to use 1/2 a chili. Also I fried the tortilla for a few seconds to crisp it up.

The fish was very good.  I baked it in the oven at 400 for 20 mintes flipping once. The panko made it nice and crisp. The lime dressing was easy and good. 
The chipotle mayo was way too hot. None of my guest could tolerate even a tsp on their tacos. I only used 1 pepper too. Next time I will use only 1 pepper and no sauce.

Best fish tacos I've ever had.  2 things:

1) I hate cole-slaw. So, I mixed chopped cilantro with a leaf of chopped swiss chard (from garden), and chopped cherry tomatoes with the chipotle mayo.

2) Due to poor planning, I didn't have time to marinate in lime juice.  I marinated for about 15 minutes while I prepped everything else. I also added some seasonings to the marinade and to the flour I dredged them in later.

One of my favorite recipes! It's great as is, but I like to make a couple of modifications, to make it healthier and quicker. 

I bread the fish as it says (which by the way I use tilapia filets, 1 per person, cut into 3rds), then bake for about 20 minutes at 350, turning once in the middle. Sometimes I have to cut the temp up close to the end. They don't get as 'pretty' this way, but still taste great! 

Also, our local Publix sells a Chipotle Mayonnaise, and it to me is just as good as the homemade, plus much easier. Only downside is you can't make that lower fat. Last thing is I don't mix up the slaw, but instead just layer the sauce/coleslaw/cilantro in the taco which is a time & dish saver. 

Like others said, DON'T skip the panko crumbs, honey-lime sauce or the mayo! (And if you do, don't come back to give it a bad rating!) Then eat and enjoy, imagining you are on the beaches of the Baja!

This was such an impressive recipe! All the ingredients came together so well!!  
We didn't use cilantro, but that was for personal taste. If you don't like too much heat, I would use less adobo and peppers.

Delicious! I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so I fried the fish using just the flour and egg, which still turned out fine. I also didn't have any coleslaw, and made corn salsa instead, and used that as my topping and OMG! I brushed the chipotle mayo on each fish, and topped it with the corn salsa, and this recipe has now become our favortie fish taco. Thank you for sharing!

What was really exceptional in my book was the honey-cumin mixture over the freshly cooked fish.  I made everyone try a bite without the overbearing (but yummy) chipotle slaw and sauce.  We also topped the taco with a fresh made mango salsa.  I thought I had otherwise follwed the recipe exactly but on further review - I see that I did not mix in the chipotle mayo with the slaw - only used it as a spread on the tortilla.  Nothing lost in that translation.  Really tasty.  I found the dredging and breading of the fish to be more time-consuming than I like but it was worth it.

I love this fish taco recipe.  The honey-cumin drizzle was a nice touch.  The only change I made was that I used pre-seasoned fish breading.  I can tell that I will be making this many, many times in the future.

This is delicious!! I baked the fish in the oven at 350 for 20 min as someone suggested, but it didn't come out as brown as I would've liked so I finished it in a pan with a little oil. My husband was doubting the idea of fish tacos but he snapped up thirds!

Great recipe! The only things I do differently are substitute homemade corn tortillas for the flour (they are much tastier!), and since I don't have panko crumbs I just use regular whole wheat bread crumbs and they come out great.

Delicious! I was not disappointed by this recipe.    This is my first time making this, and I tripled it because I had 3 lbs of tilapia I had to use, and it had such great reviews I was assured it would turn out good. And did it! I made some modifications: instead of dipping each piece of fish in the flour, the egg, and the Panko crumbs separately, I saved time by placing my tilapia chunks into a big bowl, dumping the flour in and mixing it up well, dumping the eggs in and mixing well, and then dumping the crumbs in and mixing well. Crude, perhaps, but it worked fine. I oiled a baking pan, placed the fish in it, and baked it at 350 F for about 20 minutes. Again, I totally guessed on the time and temperature, but it came out well. For the slaw, I used broccoli slaw because I had a bunch on hand, but it tasted just as good. I also used corn tortillas (heated with a touch of oil on the griddle) instead of flour...just because I think tacos taste ten times better with corn tortillas. Finally, I did cut down on the chipotle peppers a little, because it was plenty spicy.    Next time I make this, I might substitute some yogurt in place of some mayo, to cut down on the fat content.    Muchas muchas gracias SCAREY76! =D    PS - One thing: be advised this might take quite a bit of prep time; at least for me it did...keep that in mind if you're going to squeeze your lime juice fresh, flour-and-bread each piece of fish separately, etc, etc. Shortcuts are your friend :)

I did not care for this at all.  The best part was the fish, but the chipotle mayo was way too spicy, (and we all like spicy in my family).  The prep time was too long and we did not care for the flavor at all.  Sorry I won't be making this again.

This was such an amazing combination of flavors! To make things a little easier, I skipped breading the fish myself, and just used beer battered frozen fish fillets. Also, for the chipotle mayo, I just used some San Marcos Chipotle salsa and mixed it in with the mayo. Overall, very easy and very impressive! Would be great with avocado.

Excellent recipe... cut the filets in half lengthwise.  Easier to bread and fry, than the chunks.

I knew when preparing this that all the flavors were strong.  When put all together, this is an explosion of flavors.  I thought the cumin got lost in the lime juice.  Since I love cumin, I may add a little to the fish directly with the salt and pepper next time.  I used 2 peppers and a just a dash of cayenne.  Had a nice kick to it.  For those in the family that thought it was to much, simply not spreading extra on the tortilla made it just right for them.  This recipe has now become my flagship recipe by which all others will be judged.

Delicious!!! The only reason why I put 4 stars is because I think it needed a more refreshing kick into the slaw, like some fine chopped onions. But my BF loved it and gobbled massive amounts :)

Everyone loved these and can't wait to eat them again.  I used corn meal and flax meal to bread and fry the fish.  I mixed chopped cilantro in with the sweet lime dressing and mixed that in with the cole slaw.  For the mayo sauce I did not use any cayenne pepper and it came out just the right amount of hot.

Hmm, these were soo good! I couldn't find adobo sauce at my neighbor grocery store. So I had to make my own. I think it really made the tacos special. I haven't seen another recipe for thise so I will add mine to the recipes. Thanks!

Just what I was looking for! Great zing, zip, and sweetness wrapped in a tortilla. I always warm corn tortillas in a pan. . .more flavor than flour ones.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe and they came out perfect. The only thing I did differently was I served them on a hard tostada shell which gave them even more crunch. I will be making these time and time again.****update***I have made these numerous times now and always follow the recipe exactly except for the flour/corn tortilla sub due to our preference. This recipe is the one my hubby speaks of most often out of the many I have made from this site. This is his all time favorite I do believe. This last time I made them (6/2011) I made a huge short-cut because I was in a hurry to get down to the pond to fish. I used FISHSTICKS of all things and even though they were not as tasty as sticking to the recipe and breading your own tilapia, they still turned out good and something to consider if you are short on time. Again, I was in a hurry and didn't take the picture until the next day so the slaw spent too much time absorbing to make for the pretty colorful slaw that it is when you first make it but it was still just as tasty if not more. My next go at this recipe will be with fresh catfish from the pond. Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe!

I just made these tacos over the weekend and I am already planning on making them again this week.  The only change I made was instead of frying the fish I baked mine in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes.  The fish was just as crispy as if I had fried it but much healthier.

Next time I won't bread the fish I'll just saute it after marinating mostly because to me crunchy fish isn't essential though for some people it was what they enjoyed most. Also I thought the honey/cumin brush on after wasn't a neccessary step either as the cilantro/chipotle/slaw kind of overpowered that taste. Very delicious recipe however and I would recommend it highly to anyone but also recommend that they make it as-written the first time and decide for themselves.

I love grilled fish tacos - so I omitted the breading, but still slathered in the lime/honey/cumin sauce as it grilled on the stove. As someone else suggested, I used jicama and carrots rather than traditional coleslaw, and omitted the peppers in favor of just using more of the adobo sauce for flavor...I was being lazy about pulling out the food processor. This way, I could just mix the mayo with the sauce. A great combination of unusual flavors!! I'm excited to have a fish taco recipe to make at home!

These tacos were absolutely fantastic!  Each component added to the textures and flavors making them dance deliciously in your mouth.  We loved the slaw, even on it's own.  And the chipolte mayo added that final touch of creaminess and a little spicy smoke.  This recipe deserves all five of it's stars!   I made this again and added a slice or two of avacado and wrapped them in grilled corn torillas and gave them an extra squeeze of lime.   Either way-heaven,  pure heaven.

BEWARE this is not a fish taco recipe! It is a recipe that will make even your kids LOVE fish. This is delightful! My kids won't eat the tacos because of the spicyness but I made them just the fish and they tore it up! I adored the chipotle slaw. Not a mouthful was left. I was worried that after 4 hours of the fish being in lime juice it would be over cooked since acid cooks fish on its own. But it stayed light and delicate and the honey lime sauce was just the cherry on top to this recipe! This went in my recipe box and I will make it again and again!

Between the tilapia, panko, and slaw, this isn’t the cheapest of dinners, but it is money well spent (and far tastier than the greasy glop some places serve as fish tacos.) We really like this meal and it has quickly become a family favorite, but a few notes. 1) I’ve searched many food stores and can’t find the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I use pico de gallo instead and while it is a decent substitute, I can see why the chipotle mayonnaise really is that element that brings this dish together. 2) Because panko are lighter and fluffier than Italian breadcrumbs, you must use the recommended amount of oil (if not more). If you skimp on the oil, you’ll run the risk of blackened breadcrumbs and the fish won’t be cooked thoroughly. 3) That being said, I also think smaller chunks work better than larger pieces. It means more time flouring, dipping, etc, but then you’ll get fully cooked, evenly browned fish when frying (and you’ll be able to cram more fish pieces into your tortillas!) 4) I think broccoli slaw, rather than coleslaw, is a better match for this meal. Admittedly, more expensive and I don’t know how well it will absorb the chipotle mayo, but we really like the extra crunch it provides. Overall, this meal has everything we’re looking for – it’s a healthier alternative to other meal options, but still possesses a lot of flavor and taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was getting worried that these were not going to be worth the effort, but I was wrong. They were delicious! Time consuming, but not difficult. I made the mayo the day before which helped in prep time. Perfectly spicy. The fish was crispy and fresh. I used broccoli slaw instead of traditional, and the color was fabulous!:)

AMAZING. I did 1/2 baked fish (on pan coated with olive oil) and 1/2 deep fried (which I NEVER do). Have to say, the deep fried was outta this world. Baked fish was 4-star-worthy.

A beautiful looking dish too - one that is sure to impress guests and family alike :)

All I can is WOW!!!!  This is amazing. I watched an episode where Bobby Flay said not to use tilapia for fish tacos.up until now I haven't really cared for tilapia but this dis changed all that. These were the best fish tacos I have ever eaten.I did not change anything in this recipe. I thought that it would be a time-consuming recipe with moderate difficulty but it ended up being very quick and easy. My fiance is Hispanic. I fixed his plate was 2 tacos and then went to fix my plate. I came back and his plate was cleared lol.  HE LOVED THEM and that is saying alot.  This will definitely be the only recipe we will be using for fish tacos.

This made a delicious salad. Next time I think I'll read up a bit on frying fish before I start. Following these instructions, the fish was frying very fast on the outside but not fast enough on the inside.

Let's try this again: I am not a fish eater and my boyfriend had only had fish tacos once. He hated them. Regardless, I wanted to try something new, so I made these. I didn't change anything about the recipe, except I drizzled the honey sauce on the fish instead of brushing it because I didn't have a brush. They were fabulous. My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating them. The chipotle mayo as a stand alone is a great recipe. I made more the next day to dip things (crackers, fries, fingers, etc) in. Will definitely be making this again.

Husband and I thought this was excellent.  The honey-cumin sauce is great.  The only thing I'd change is the spiciness.  Too hot for me.  So next time I might deseed half of the peppers (I doubled the recipe).  But I thought it was an excellent change up in the meal routine.  (Kids didn't like it at all though)
Thanks for the recipe!

sooo yummy!  I made with halibut because that's what we had in the freezer.  followed recipes as directed otherwise.  so delicious.  to those who feel that the sauce overpowers the fish.... this is not a simple fish recipe.  all the flavours combine to make one great big flavour.  If you're looking for a fishy recipe, this obviously is not it.  Personally, I did not find the adobo sauce overpowering at all.

I liked this, and DH loved it!  This is an excellent crust for fish, and I think you could do whole fish with this breading for great results.  I don't think it's necessary to marinate in lime juice for 4 hours, though.  I love the lime-honey-cumin sauce for the fish, too.  The chipotle mayo is good, but for the faint of heart, if you use purchased chipotle mayonnaise, it would not be as hot as the homemade in this dish.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

A summer staple for two years strong!  I also add a shot of tequila to the marinade.  Being from Wisconsin, we do like to add spicy pepperjack cheese as well.  However, the recipe is perfect the way it is.

Delicious but spicy!!! I had blue fish that I had just caught, marinated for longer than 4 hours in lime juice (probably a little too long).  

First time I made them I followed all the directions.  Second time, I skipped adding layer of mayo to tortilla.  I made the Refried beans without the Refry from this site and spread those on tortilla first, then chipotle slaw, fish, topped with fresh pico de gallo and dollop of sour cream...which is great for those trying to cut down the spice.

Perfect and absolutely THE best fish tacos I have ever had. I used halibut for the fish and did not change a thing. Delicious! Don't change anything with the recipe.

Very good recipe. I baked the talapia instead of frying it. I only used one chipotle pepper instead of two, because it would have been way too spicy. I didn't use salt, and I used Kraft sandwich spread instead of mayo. It was great.

Dee-Dee Licious!! Scrumptious!!! Made the recipe to a T, lots of steps but loved the way the recipe was written out for each step, made it all so much easier.  Made the Avocado, Mango and Tomato salsa also from this site, along with black beans and rice. These are the best fish tacos we have ever eaten and we had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Loved the way the fish tasted being basked in the lime. Have already shared this recipe with three friends - a must try!

Very yummy!  I only used 1.5 of the chipotle peppers and 1 tsp of the sauce....my husband was wiping the sweat from his forehead but, loved them! I also baked the fish (I don't fry anything) so they probably weren't as crunchy.  :)

Pretty good, I used frozen breaded fish fillets to make it quick & easy, couldn't find chipolte chilies in adobe sauce so I used a chipolte mayo.  Served on sun-dried tomato wraps - very good.

Oh my gosh these were SO good!  Definitely restaurant quality.  I must admit we didn't have fish on hand, so I used fish sticks.  But it was STILL amazing!  I love the mayonnaise and the honey-cumin sauce.  Mmmmm!

These were really delicious. The recipe isn't clear on how to use the honey-cumin sauce, so I took a gamble and figured it was for the slaw. After trying the chipotle sauce, I wanted a tangier sauce so I added sour cream to it. I also did not use 2 peppers, just 1 so my kids could enjoy it as well.

My family absolutely loved these!! I always thought fish tacos sounded disgusting but I like to be open minded about trying new things.  I only made some minor changes--used orange roughy, eliminated the cayenne pepper, and used only one chipotle pepper. For one c. mayo, one pepper gave just the right amount of heat if you only like it mild. I doubled everything but will make a lot more chipotle mayo next time.

I made this the first time tonight as a low heat meal alternative than running the stove or stove top for long. We give it 4 starts do the higher calories; I always make a recipe as it calls for the first time to ensure flavor quality. Next time we will use non-fat Greek yogurt to replace the mayo and the flavor will be the same. I would also say those who do not like a lot of heat to reduce the pepper to 1 and 1/2TBS of sauce or add more mayo to reduce the heat ratio. We enjoyed the heat but we have a few who thought it was too hot. 

This will be a weekly or bi-weekly staple on our menu now. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

Note: time shortcut is to find already breaded fish in the frozen section.

Excellent!  Not sure if you are just suppose to use the honey/lime/oil/cumin mixture to just brush the fish, or include in the coleslaw?

I tried this yesterday but instead of breading it, I baked the fish in lime juice with dry habanero seasoning from Whole Foods. It was hot but so yummy! I also added salsa to my cole slaw to give it more of a kick.

Excellent. Being an Alaskan I made it with Alaskan Halibut. The only thing I did different was I broiled the fish unbreaded and flaked it. I have done these twice and once with company and so far everyone loves them. As a sidenote.... the chipotle mayo is the kicker. I have also used it in breakfast burritos and on burgers. It is versatile and delicious. Great recipe!

These were really good! And even though it seems like a lot of directions, was pretty easy. I couldn't find Panko bread crumbs, but used regular crumbs and cornmeal, and it was pretty good. I will definitely make it again and try to find the Panko crumbs at a different store. I will also omit the salt from the chipotle mayo next time.

I LOVE these tacos. But, like most people I tweaked it. I only use like 1/2 of a chili with the seeds and ribs (is that what they are called?) removed and I dont use the cayenne pepper. I also scale way back on the adobo sauce. u really just need to play with it, it depends on how spicy u like things (I like a little heat but I want to keep my taste buds). if it is too hot, just add more mayo. As for the fish I cheat.... I buy the Mrs. Pauls beer battered fish and bake them as directed... they are really good (and I dont have to fry anything) and they make this dinner alot easier to make on a work night!! I also use shredded lettuce instead of the cabbage, only because no one else likes cabbage but me. just one less thing to buy, but the first time I made these I used cabbage and it was good. All in all this is a great recipe and the changes I made were just personal prefferences. the honey, lime and cumin dressing is freakin amazing btw!! enjoy!

Really loved this recipe!  The only thing (for our family) was we cut back on the chipolte pepper, we love alot of kick in our food, but 2 peppers takes away from the dish.  Added a little sour cream to the slaw and used corn and flour tortillas.  Served with a mango, corn/black bean salsa....Delish!!

These were amazing! I didn't fry the fish but sprayed with Pam and baked at 400, they came out very crispy and not greasy. I used broccoli slaw since I didn't know if the family would like regular cole slaw. The sauce was a bit spicy for the kids so next time I might just use one pepper.

I was so heartbroken over this recipe.  I saw honey-cumin cilantro and chipotle mayo and I was in love with the idea of what this could have been.  The chipotle mayo was OK, but I did not care for the slaw at all.  The fish was amazing, and I hoped when I put everything together into the tortilla the flavors would all mix and it would be incredible, but the mayo was just spicy and the coleslaw was an odd texture.   And I love coleslaw normally.  I eventually ended up eating the fish by itself because that was as good as I'd hoped.  Definitely not making this ever again.

We have had these three times in the last month and will have them again when my whole family visits soon.  These are fabulous!  I almost gave it 4 stars because I think the recipe is confusing but couldn't bring myself to do it -- they were that good.  Regarding the recipe, it seems like they want you to make chipotle slaw but I'm pretty darn sure that it's honey-cumin slaw.  We make these for two people and they are very quick and extremely tasty.  There's something wonderful about the lime taste of the fish coated in panko (a favorite) coupled with that smoky and creamy chipotle mayo and the acidic and sweet crunch of the slaw.  We don't like things very hot so we cut way back on the chipotle -- actually end up just adding a bit of the adobo sauce and that works for us.  I highly recommend this to anyone.

When I make the slaw I don't add in oil.  I do finely chop cilantro and add it to the slaw mix.  Also, I only use one chipotle in the mayo and add adobo sauce to taste.

I made this about 4 months ago and ever since then it has become not only a family favorite but a fight night favorite as well! Everyone loves this recipe especially the chipotle coleslaw I make that coleslaw for everything now burgers,steaks tuna, sandwhiches and just about anything else. My hubby tells me to just keep a tub of it in the fridge at all times! LOL

BEST FISH TACO RECIPE EVER, it is mine and my bf's fav. Couple quick/healthy changes: *baked fish @ 400 instead pan-frying *we LOVE spicy, but only use 1 med/lg chili *instead of cole slaw blend julienne 1 med jicama- so much better! (if you haven't tried this yet- just go and get one, feel and try it) *use corn tortillas instead of flour

for my first time making fish taco's I thought this recipe was great.  I did use crushed saltin crackers instead of what the recipe called for.  I also cut the pepper's in half for the dressing and it was still very hot.  My husband said these were right up there with the resturant style fish tacos.  thanks for sharing.

Excellent dish! I added more chipotles to the mayo and used shredded romaine instead of the cabbage. Will make again and again!

I had to modify for ingredients on hand: I jazzed up the slaw (used fresh sliced cabbage with shredded carrot, finely chopped celery, and thinly sliced red pepper). As I didn't have chipotles, I thought that a 4 oz can of green chilies would work. Not. So I added about 2 teaspoons of chili garlic paste (I think it's also known as sambal oelek), which was great with the addition of lime juice. I did not bread the fish, as we're watching calories, so just pan-fried in a little olive oil. Yummy!

Heavenly!  We used fresh flounder my husband caught.  We also reduced the chipolte and adobo by about 1/4 because it is REALLY spicy otherwise (and we can handle some spice).

This recipe is wonderful......and others who claimed that  it was as good as in any restaurant are correct!  I am the only one in my family that likes really spicy, and this was something they all liked very well.  I went very light on the cayenne for them, but look forward to kicking it up a notch with double peppers and cayenne when cooking for buddies.  I am also going to try it with wood planked smoked fish sometime in the future.

Caution, this recipe is HOT! It caught my wife and I completely off guard and ruined what could have been a great dish. If you're into self flaggelation then this is the dish for you! I personally don't enjoy meals that require chasers of Demerol to ease the burning in my mouth. I gave it one star due only to the fact that the author should have warned people about the spicy nature of the dish.

Yum! I have never had fish tacos, so for a first attempt I thought these were wonderful! Very flavorful! I used the broccoli slaw mix instead of straight cabbage just for variety. Fresh pineapple on the side!

These were amazing! They were so good i made them the next day again! My boyfriend who loves fish but could never find a fish taco he liked..even thought these were delicious! I took leftovers to a friend of mine and her kids and they are now fans! I made them both grilled and fried and both ways are equally tasty..everyone is right DO NOT leave out the chipotle mayo and make exactly.. all the flavors together are what make this dish..i topped mine off with some avocado and a little cheddar cheese and a side of re-fried beans. If i could i would give this more stars thanks for sharing!

Yummy, Yum, Yum! These were awesome. I did made some changes. I added chili powder to the marinate, garlic, and jalapenos. I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I used bread crumbs instead. These were delicous . I also made shrimp tacos using the same indgredients and menu .

This was a very good fish taco.  I loved the slaw on top of the fish!  Okay I did do some things differently.  I didnt use the breading, I had some cajun breading in a bag that I needed to use.  So I used that and baked the fish instead of frying.  Also I marinated the fish in the honey-cumin sauce instead of just the lime juice.  I had extra honey-cumin sauce set to the side to brush on the fish after it came out of the oven.  But I forgot all about it!  So next time Im going to have to remember to do that.  Also I only used a half of a chipotle in the mayo mixture, and half the adobo sauce.  It was more than enough for the spice.  I served mine on a flour tortilla with the fish, a little shredded cheese, tomatoes, and lots of crunchy slaw on top.  By the way, I used broccoli slaw, yummy!  This is a great fish taco, and Im sure Ill make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was our first taste of fish tacos and it was good!  I didn't have the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so I used a little chipotle chili powder instead.  Also used coconut oil instead of veggie oil (healthy oil which doesn't break down with high heat).

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!!  Yum...I did not fry the fish for health reasons and not only soaked the fish with the honey sauce I also drizzled it over everything in the taco after assembling it!  So good and can't wait to make again!  Oh, and my husband HATES mayo and he was drizzling that mayo sauce over the white rice I served with this!  Haha if he only knew...lol!

4 stars b/c I loved the flavor/texture of the fish and the taste of the chipotle mayo, but not the slaw.  I especially enjoyed the fish (so simple and delicious) and will be making it alone for future meals.

Absolutely outstanding as is. Do not think you have a better idea and change anything until you have tried it as is once.  I have made it several times and you will get rave reviews from your guests. I love spicy food and thought this was just right. If you will be serving little kids it will probably be too spicy "as is". Best served with corn tortillas heated in a little bit of butter in a frying pan, a few slices of avocado and a nice cold beer.  Enjoy.

The flavors were fresh, crisp, and delicious in this dish.  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  I never used panko crumbs before but they were awesome.  The fish browned and crisped up nicely.  Just the right amount of spice and crunch.  Thanks for this keeper!

Delicious! The slaw was spicier than I expected, which was great, and the cabbage and tortillas cooled it down. Very refreshing and full of flavor! We ate the tacos with a seasoned rice and beans mix.

These are great.  I made a few accomodations for speed and ingredients on hand.  The chipotle mayo is very good. For those that don't like the heat just don't put extra on the tortilla.   I made it with corn tortillas quickly heated on a griddle.  I also used frozen lightly breaded halibut that I baked.  The lime honey didn't add much with the frozen fish but recommend finding a way to include more lime flavor.  I didn't have cilantro so I added a low-fat Trader Joes cilantro dressing to the slaw.   It took 20 minutes with these modifications.  Can't wait to have them again.

Excellent recipe once I tweaked it a bit. I added a small amount of julienned red pepper to the slaw mix, and wrapped everything up in corn tortillas. Also, I used thick plain yogurt instead of mayo - it gave just the right amount of tang to the chipotle "mayo" dressing. Delicious!

Wow! I never thought "fish tacos" sounded appealing, but am I ever glad I decided to give this recipe a try. Because of where I live, some of the ingredients called for in the original post weren't available, so I made substitutes based on other reviwers comments. (ie. added hot sauce to mayo and used in place of the chipotle mayo)The end result was still wonderful. The lime and honey compliment one another very well without being over powering to the fish flavor.

AWESOME!!! The whole family loved them! I did subsitute, because of things on hand. I used half of the lime juice for the fish, and marinated it for only 1 hour. I didn't have chipotle in adobe sauce, so I used chipotle seasoning, and added water instead of adobe sauce. I used nappa cabbage only (as said in the submitter's note). I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used dried ( will use fresh next time). I used half of the panko crumbs and only 1 egg. It still worked. This is a very forgiving recipe. LOVE IT!!! I will make again and again!!!

We thought these were good but I'm debating whether they were worth the effort.  The peppers are way too hot.  I used only 1 and it was still really, really hot.  Also, I didn't really love the cumin sauce.  I think cumin is better when it is cooked into something not just 'raw', if that makes any sense.

I liked this recipe very much. The fish marinade was excellent, and both the mayo and the coleslaw were delicious too. I addded tomato slices in my taco, and this worked out very well! I only found that the slaw was a bit too much, next time I will add less, so that it does not overpower everything else. Great dinner idea - and trully authentic tasting!

Absolutely delicious!  The perfect blend of spicy (thanks to the chipotle mayo coleslaw) and sweet (brushing the honey cumin sauce on the just-fried fish).  My grocer didn't have tilapia, so I used cod instead, a perfect substitution.  Especially good served with a side of refried black beans.

Excellent!  My husband loves this recipe.  He now tries to order fish tacos out and always says they aren't as good as this recipe!  I'm not a huge meat eater and I even thought this was pretty good.  Do not try and save time by buying frozen breaded tilapia fillets it's not as good and your family will know!  Follow the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!!! I can't rave about this one enough. I loved it and my husband said it was the best recipe I have made from this site (and possibly ever...) and I think I agree with him. It is a perfect dish. I halved the recipe since there was just two of us eating and the portions were accurate. I followed the recipe exactly (aside from using plain slaw instead of tri-color... couldn't find any, and slightly less oil for the frying.) I topped them with some fresh chopped tomato. I will be making this again and again, a delightful combination of fresh ingredients, crispy fish, and spicy, savory, and sweet flavors.

Delicioso!!!  My husband and I are Berry Hill Fish Tacos at heart and these are the perfect competition.  I omitted the cumin, because I'm not a fan, but the results were still perfect.  Do not skip the sauce! Is the best part!!! Thanks for sharing.

My husband grew up in Mexico city and loves Mexican food.  I tried this recipe and he said "I think this is the best meal you have ever made" .  We loved it...as a matter of fact, I am subbing the fish with shrimp tonite.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

These are better than any I have ever had out.  I made them for our 1 year anniversary meal at home and they were a hit.   I didn't add the cayenne pepper after reading one of the comments about it being to spicy.  It was just perfect for us. I also added red onion to the coleslaw. I make this recipe a lot and have now found that I can bake the fish to cut the calories of frying. I have also used tofu instead of fish and it is wonderful too.

Ouch!  I made these tacos the day before the previous review was written.  Wish I had cut the chipotle down to one pepper.  Very hot, even omitting the cayenne.

The fish was GREAT, the slaw was VERY hot!  I even threw out the first batch and made another with only one chipotle pepper, but we still found it very spicy.  I will definitely make the fish again, but will try a different topping.

Unfortunately, we love this recipe.

I never fry. NEVER. And I'm halfway through making this recipe when I realize, uh-oh, I'm supposed to fry these things. My husband was excited. 

They are delicious. But be warned - you don't need a lot of the spicy mayo spread on the tortilla. We love spicy foods, and it was pretty hot. We still loved it, but some people might not. 

Instead of cabbage I used romaine lettuce, chopped. My husband isn't a huge fan of cabbage. We also halved the recipe to serve two. We had leftover fish, but that was all.

This recipe is awesome!  I did make a few changes though, I used perch for the fish (all I had) and I used a beer batter for this recipe (I used the one from fish tacos submitted by Tanya, but there is also a really good beer batter recipe submitted by Letty Simmet) and I omitted the cumin because I don't like it.  I thought that this recipe was excellent, the honey-lime dressing, the slaw, and the fish really compliment each other well.  This recipe replaces Tanya's as my favorite fish taco recipe...I highly recommend it!!

5+++++ This is truly the best thing I have made from this site. Followed the recipe to the tee except I doubled the chipotle mayo slaw because it was so good. I did half the amount of cilantro because I am not a huge fan. Definitely a keeper!!!!

Great flavor and easy to make.  I made the dressings and slaw, and soaked the fish in lemon juice in a zip-lock bag the night before.  The next day all I had to do was fry the fish.  The flavors of the Honey-Cumin and the chipotle Mayo were wonderful.  I'm not a fish lover, but I love these fish tacos!

We will definitely make it again. A few changes were made; add less lime juice to the cumin honey sauce than it requires or it will be too limey. No cayenne pepper is needed; it detracts from the chipotle flavour to have it and if you want more spice just add more chipotle peppers.

My young sons and I love these!   I use the honey-cumin sauce mixed with a bit of mayo for the slaw because chipotle would not go over well.  The only fish tacos and the only coleslaw they will eat!

I left the tilapia in large chunks. I also used lemon instead of lime juice.

I made homemade corn tortilla which was so simple and worthwhile. I also made yellow rice on the side.

This recipe is on our permanent roster from now on.

My husband loved it. I wish I made a double batch. It’s something you could make weekly and still love.

THIS IS THE BOMB! I made this to the T except I thought I had the panko crumbs NO:(, so had to crush up some butter crackers. Everything else was exact but,  next time I will make sure I have the right crumbs.  I hate frying, but I did it.  Next time I think I will bake it because I don't want to clean up the mess again.  My husband just couldn't stop eating it, and talked about how good it was after dinner.  I broke up the long list of prep by doing different steps of the recipe through out the day and refrigerating each sauce or item.  It worked out so much better for me.   If you are overwhelmed by the steps you could most certainly do this over a two day period.  I would just wait to put any of the sauces on anything until your ready to fry.

These were excellent!  I have made them by just pan searing (no breading) and frying (with the breading). They are better breaded. Hubs loved them the way the recipe stated!  I did, too!the slaw was very good and the honey lime sauce really meshed well with the chipotle mayo.

I could taste that hint of lime juice from fish. My wife liked the fish and was suprised when I told her it was tilapia. I enjoyed the fish taco and would make it again.

Yes! These were AMAZING. A lot of work but I did most of the prep ahead of time, making the sauces and cole slaw the day before. We had swordfish steaks in the freezer, so that  is the fish that I used and it worked great. I also accidentally dropped the first few portions of the fish in the egg first, then flour, then back in the egg then the panko and it was just as good if not better. The sauce, my God, the sauce. My very picky boyfriend was super skeptical when I told him fish tacos. He was not even going to try them. He ate the whole thing without putting it down and said "I'd have those again." WIN!

If I could give an additional half star, I would.  I made it exactly as written but skipped on the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce.   My fiance absolutely loved this recipe...I just liked it.  The sauce that was brushed on the fish wasn't balance to me.  It was more acidic than sweet.  But, he loves it so I'll make it over and over and adjust.

These fish tacos were amazing. It was more prep than I prefer, but was well worth the time. My husband is very picky and he loved these! I will definitely be making this recipe again! Would highly recommend.

We really loved this recipe but had some problems with the directions. We ended up just winging it with the ingredients. We didn't have limes so I used oranges, I put that dressing on the slaw which was 1/2 tri colored and 1/2 broccoli slaw. The mayo we used as garnish. We also grilled the fish. It was very good. That mayo makes a great spread.

we LOVE this one! BEST fish tacos ever. We like to make extra mayo so we can use it on sandwiches later! It takes a little time, but it's definitely worth it! 

We forgot to let the fish marinate for 4 hours, so we did it for an hour before we started cooking and it was still fabulous! We've made this a few times, and I didn't notice a taste difference from marinating for 1 hour or 4 hours.

Oh my GOD!!!  This is SO good!!!  The only change I made was to use Cod in place of Tilapia.  I t holds together better when being fried.  I cannot wait to make this again - ad I think that will need to be tomorrow.  :). GRFEAT RECIPE!!!

This is an amazingly delicious recipe and I make it all the time. I've started cutting the fish into longer skinny strips to make the breading and cooking process easier and faster.

The people who gave this a negative review and didn't even follow the recipe, what the heck is wrong with you. For instance "marinating for 15 minutes and then grilled". Those reviews should be deleted.

This is the 2nd time I've made the recipe.  I used raw shrimp that I grilled instead of coating and frying fish.  Even after I decreased the chipotle peppers and cayenne, and increased the mayo, it was still way too spicy for us. Flavor was great but just too hot for my family.

For the kids I put the honey cumin dressing on the cole-slaw mixture, and spread the chipotle mayo on my tortilla.  Also, make plenty of chipotle mayo: it lasts in the fridge and tastes great on sandwiches and wraps of all kinds.

The taste was flat and lifeless. Tilapia is a good fish to select to pick up flavors unfortunately it was not used to its best in this recipe.

I looked through a few recipes on this site for fish tacos and kinda came up with my own from what I found. I used the HONEY-CUMIN sauce from this one. We drizzled the honey mixture over our tacos as a topping...LOVED IT!!!! It was an unexpected kick to tacos. YUMMY

Hands down the greatest fish tacos I've ever had.  After reading the glowing reviews I was skeptical but decided to give it a go.  I followed the recipe exactly and remained skeptical as I prepped and tasted the coleslaw and lime/honey mixture.  After the tacos were assembled and I had my first bite I was a believer!  These were truly delicious and will now be a part of our normal meal rotation.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I grilled the fish, no way would I fry, the marinade is soooo good! Salt and pepper the fish first. Had to add lots of salt after it was cooked

Add some guacamole to this recipe and they are hands down the best fish tacos we have ever had.

This recipe is WONDERFUL as written, but I make some changes to save time and effort. I use frozen fish sticks (I know, I know) and use shredded coleslaw mix, cilantro, cumin, and pre-made chipotle mayonnaise for the slaw. Top them with sliced avocado. Quick and delicious--done in about 20 minutes, or however long it takes your fish to cook, and far fewer dishes to wash at the end.

We loved the fruited salsa. I did add red onion to the salsa. We didn't care for the rest, but the salsa was amazing with the fish.

FIVE STAR FISH TACOS!  Prepared the recipe exactly as written, and it tasted delicious.  ...Perfect heat/spice with a terrific blend of flavors.  A little labor intensive to flour, dip, dredge and fry, but well worth the effort.  All amounts of honey-cumin sauce, coleslaw and mayo-chipotle sauce fit proportionately with the one pound worth of tilapia.  Will make this again!  ...Would not change a thing!

I substituted flounder, kept the chipotle mayo (but added sour cream to tame the heat) & honey lime sauce as is, substituted argula for the coleslaw/cilantro mix, and served it all on the flat bread from Fry Bread Tacos II (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Fry-Bread-Tacos-II/Detail.aspx).
Fabulous! A lot of prep, but worth it.

My husband loved this and he is not a big fish eater.  The downside was that I seemed to use every bowl in my kitchen for all the various mixing of ingredients.  It was delicious though!

Oh my this was tasty! I didn't really change the ingredients but I read the other reviews and thought that adding the honey, lime, cumin mix to the coleslaw sounded like a good idea. And it was! I think I'll use a little less cumin next time though, it was a tad strong but perhaps if you decide to follow the recipe and brush it on the fish then the cumin level as written would be just right.  I also thought that would detract from the crunchiness of the fish. We used the chipotle mayo as a topping therefore keeping the spice level to our own liking. While the kids are getting a little more adventurous as they get older they still don't like things too spicy. Because I've make chipotle mayo before I knew one pepper with 1 tablespoon of the adobo sauce and no cayenne was going to be just right for us.  I seeded the pepper and added a bit of lime juice and a pinch of sugar to the mixture too. Some reviewers said the fish was bland.  I can't really comment on that since I didn't brush the fish with the honey, lime, cumin mixture. I did season with salt and pepper and it was fine by me.  Especially with the addition of the coleslaw and the mayo. But the texture of the fried panko bread crumbs and the crunchy coleslaw together was divine! Next time I make this I will cut the fish into long strips (think fajita) instead of chunks. It will save me time and won't do anything to adversely affect the outcome.

We loved this recipe!! I made fish sticks for my 3 young boys, but they wanted, ate and loved the fish tacos. We marinated the fish the full 4 hours, and were happy we did. I will use this technique with other fish dishes,it gives great flavor. We had extra sauce, mayo and slaw so I took it over to my mom's for her to give it a try. Rave reviews from them too. Any leftover slaw is AWESOME on a turkey sandwich!!

OMG!!!...this is by far one of the best recipes I made.  I did not even need the tortilla.  I used mostly greek yogurt with the coleslaw and added 1 tbls of mayo...absolutely delicious. Also, I only marinated the fish for about 30 minutes. I will always make this, the lime flavor gives it a nice smooth taste.

My husband & I tried this tonight.  We loved it!!  It had such a great flavor.  I did not read any of the reviews, so these comments may or may not be found in others.  1) It took about 1 1/2 hours to make, 2) We marinated the fish for about 1 hour vs. 4.  We thought it was the right amount of time.  We used fresh lime juice and you defintely tasted the lime, 3) The chipotle mayo definitely has a kick.  Not too much though, 4) The 3 step dredging was time consuming with all of the pieces of fish, 5) The coleslaw was easy and delicious with the cilantro.  I don't like cabbage, so I was surprised, 6)  The flavor of the chipotle mayo (which i thought would overpower the fish) was perfect. The lime cut the spice and vice-versa.  It was a fabulous dish.  We're looking forward to a dinner party where we can show it off!

Eating the leftovers for lunch right now...Delicious. A few things: Only marinated the fish for about an hour or 2 in the lime juice and it was fine, I may even forego doing that completely in the future. I had a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of honey cumin sauce left over so I'd cut that in half and see how far that takes you, unless you like to drown your food in lime juice twice over. If you like spicy throw in an extra chile into the chipotle mayo. I didn't mix the coleslaw with the cilantro and dressing, just let everyone do what they wanted. I'm thinking next time I'll mix some of the honey cumin sauce with the chipotle mayo and  mix that with the coleslaw.

This is such a good recipe that we make all the time, even for company. The slaw and hot sauce mixture can be used on any mexican-style dish. We have used them on grilled fish, breaded and fried fish, marinated and grilled flank steak, really anything. Fresh tortillas are a must if they are available to you.

Love these. These tacos are a little bit of a labor of love, but they taste great! For the honey cumin sauce, I just drizzle it over the fried fish.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight - I use allrecipes a couple times a week for new recipes and this is the first time I've ever commented! The only thing I did different was I didn't bread the tilapia and I cut way down on the adobo. I also didn't put cilantro in the coleslaw and used dill as a topping instead, just because it was what I had. It was sooo delicious! My fiance and I agreed it was restaurant quality and flavor. Also, I didn't bread it for calorie reason, but even if I wasn't worried about the calories, I really don't think breading it is necessary! There are so many great flavors going on with the coleslaw, honey-cumin sauce, and the fish that I don't even know if that could make it any better! Definitely will be making this on a regular basis.

This recipe is fantastic!  Oh man.  I used frozen tortilla crusted tilapia instead of frying it myself.  The chipotle mayo is finger-lickin good.  It is spicy but the sweetness from the honey lime sauce really cuts through that and balances it out wonderfully.  If you want it less spicy just cut the chipotle peppers down to one or remove the seeds.  I can't wait to make these again!

Even without the breading and frying, this was great. I cooked the marinated fish on my grill. I also added chipotle and ancho chilie powder to the cumin mixture for extra spice.

I made these for my boyfriends birthday and he said they were better than his favorite restaurants :) I only used one chipotle pepper. I always thought that marinating fish for a long time in anything acidic would start to cook it. So I only marinated the fish for about an hour. I apologize for gramtical errors :)

These are incredible!! Best fish tacos I've ever had!! My husband and teenage son agreed. The chipotle may is to die for, trying to find other recipes to use it on. It's fairly easy, the breading of the fish is the time consuming part.

These fish tacos were good, I did do things different...of course... I didn't have cumin but that honey and lime mixture was fantastic, I would eat the fish just with that sauce on it as is... I did skip the 4 hr lime on the fish cause I didn't have time and it still came out good. I also thought the slaw needed something so I added a couple tablespoons of rice wine vinegar it was the perfect addition. I too am not a big fan of super spicy so skipped the cayenne pepper and only added 1 chipolte pepper and it was the perfect amout of heat. I will definatly make these again!!

I have to admit, I read the recipe wrong.  I used the lime juice/honey mix as the dressing for the slaw.  It was delicious.  The completed tacos were so yummy.  They were a little more work than most things I cook, but well worth the effort.

These were very good.  For the chipotle mayo I only used about a Tbsp. of the "sauce" from a can of chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce since my grocery doesn't carry the sauce alone.  It had just the right amount of spice for my family - not too hot.  The fish was very flaky and tender and had a great flavor.  Very easy to make and quick to throw together.  Only had about 2 hours to marinate the fish, which was fine, but will definitely try this again when I have more time.

This recipe turns out great every time, and my whole family likes it.  The only thing I change is how many chili's I use in the mayo, cause I can't take that much heat.

These fish tacos were yummy! Made both dressings ahead while fish marinated. Fairly easy to make and the dressing I made extra to put on coleslaw the next night with pulled BBQ pork sandwiches. Hubby said they could be in a restaurant so I guess he liked the too!!

I tried this recipe for the first time the other night.  This was really good.  A little spicey (I think I used too many chipotle chillies)  I did double the recipe for my family.  Had enough for seconds the next day.  Would not change anything in this recipe.  The pahko crust for the fish really worked well, kept the fish nice and crunchy.  It you get a chance try this recipe for sure.

I loved the honey glaze to put on the fish, it kind of reminded me of the crust on deep  fried ice cream. Yum! I found the chipotle mayo to be quite hot so I added a little bit of sour cream and sugar. I also added some lime juice and milk, to thin it out, as I found it to be a little thick to mix with the cabbage. I had some wonderful cherry tomatoes that I quartered and added too. But other than that, it was pretty tasty. Instead of spreading some of the mayo mix on the tortilla, I put some sourcream and mango lime salsa instead. Tried it as a "po'boy" as well.

These were amazing! My family absolutely loved these tacos and asked if I can make them regularly. I always make recipes to order the first time around, but with this recipe I didn't put in as much chipotle peppers only because I tasted it after I put in about half of what it called for and the flavor and heat were perfect for my family. Plus, I didn't realize until I was prepping the fish that I forgot to put the cayenne pepper in with the mayo, so I put a dash or two into the flour as I was breading the fish. So, no major changes...and, it was perfect!!!! This will be served often from now on!

The fish by itself was outstanding - but the Chipotle Mayo/Slaw was not as good as I had expected.  (made the recipe exactly as written)  I also thought it was a little time consuming.  Still good - but I will probably look for something else...

We loved this recipe, especially the simple chipotle mayo and cabbage combo.  My husband never had fish tacos before and finally discovered why I love them so much.  We had some issues in frying the fish chunks, but I think it was because we oversoaked them in eggs before adding the breadcrumbs. The batter wouldn't stick well to the fish. Will definitely make again, but we want to grill the fish the next time to keep it a little healthier. All in all, this is an excellent recipe!

Grilled fish instead of frying.  Used the marinade from the "Grilled Fish Tacose with Chipolte-Lime Dressing"  The adobe mayo was great!!!  Served with fresh pico and cut up avacado.  Yum

Very tasty, however I have two recommendations.  1) Bake rather than fry the fish.  2) Use half the chipotle and adobo sauce the recipe calls for (full amount was way too spicy).

My husband and I have finally decided that we just don't like tilapia!  I have tried cooking it at least a half-dozen different ways, and despite the fact that everybody talks about how bland this fish is, we have found it to be extremely strong-flavored, such that the flavor of the fish overpowers everything else about the dish.  The only change I made to this recipe was to broil the marinated fish instead of deep-frying (our tummies just don't do fried any more).  The sauce and slaw were delish!  I plan to try making this with another mild fish (cod, halibut), and I am sure it will rate 5+ stas.  Thanks for a good basic recipe - with the right fish for us, I am sure it will become one of our favorites, as we love the food at Taco del Mar, but find it too be way too salty for our tastes.

I found that if you double both of the sauce then it makes the tacos much better. Also if you grill the fish instead of deep frying and use mahi mahi instead of tilapia it makes for much better tacos.

Loved this dish.  Made almost exactly as described other than accidentally added the salt and cayenne to the marinade and only marinaded for about 30 minutes.  Also used 1 cup mayo for extra and added some honey cumin sauce to the slaw as well.  Fabulous!!

The chipotle mayo dressing was a little spicy for our taste, but the sweetness of the honey cumin sauce helped tone it down.  I served this with a black bean salsa on the side.  This is a keeper!

made as directed several times now.  It is a lot of work but absolutely worth it.  these tacos are spicy hot (be careful with the adobo sauce!), crunchy, and toped with a hint of sweet sauce.  each time i plan to try with corn tortillas, but the recipes is sooo good there is no point in messing with perfection!

There was WAY too much chipotle - way too much - i added only 1/2 chilli and 1/2 tsp of the adobo and it was still too hot.  Wasn't too fond of the coleslaw - it was kind of bland - maybe it would be better with the honey cumin dressing added to the may.  Did like the fish with the panko.  Overall it didn't really have a variety and balance of flavors. I wouldn't make this for guests.

OMG! the best  fish taco ever!  Don't miss the chipotle mayo, it rocks!  Hubby doesn't like cabbage so we used iceburg lettuce and it was still the best!  The flavors blend so well, so fresh, will definitely make again---weekly!

This recipe was great! However it took me a lot longer to put it all together than the prep time suggests.

What a yummy recipe! Verrry California! The recipe was easy to make. Get the mayo, coleslaw, and other fixings ready (we added guacomole) ahead of frying the fish as it will all come together very quickly after the fish is done. If you are not into spicy, I would cut down to one chipotle chile and omit the cayenne pepper. This one is a keeper - thanks, SCAREY76!

I really liked these tacos and in fact have been craving them, but none of my kids liked them and my husband wasn't a fan of the frying.   I only marinated the fish for about three hours (although I added extra lime juice) and that was plenty. I can't handle super spicy so I used just one chili and none of the adobo sauce.

Excellent! Unfortunately I did not have any cilantro. I  am sure it would have been even better. Next time I will add tomatoes to top it off and try the chipotle with sour cream mixed in.  Husband loved it. Too spicy for the kids but they enjoyed the fish nuggets.

I think we loved these even more than the ones we get at our favorite restaurant.  I left out the cayan because the mayo was plenty spicey without it.  I think I will cut back on the peppers next time for hubby's sake.  They were a bit too spicey for him but he still loved them.  I was a bit perplexed because after making the honey cumin sauce the directions never mention it again so I was left wondering what the heck I was supposed to do with it.  I'd already tossed the cabbage mix with some of the mayo so I added more cabbage and poured in some of the honey cumin sauce too.  There was far more honey cumin sauce than would ever be needed if just mixing it with the slaw.  Next time I will mix the sauce with the slaw and coat the fish with the mayo.  Next time I will also grill or oven fry the fish since we really don't need the extra calories and I'm sure it will be just as good that way.  We also opted for corn tortillas (heated in a pan coated with Pam, makes perfect soft taco shells and no greasy oil).  This may just become our dinner every Friday night.  We loved them that much!

my family loves this! I took other reviewers suggestion and only used one pepper since my children cant handle anything too spicy. I also substituted light sourcream for about half of the mayonnaise which lightened it up a bit but still had a wonderful flavor and texture. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and we were delighted!

The slaw is worth it. So good. That was the only thing I followed to a T so I can't very well rate everything else. Try the slaw! Oh, and if you read the description, it says the slaw is dressed with the honey-cumin sauce and the tilapia is topped with the mayo??

I really love these tacos, and they've become a staple meal for me.  The only adjustment I made to the recipe was to oven "fry" the fish, rather than pan fry it.  The fish still comes out extra crispy and golden.

These were delishious tacos! I love the mayo, but only used 1 pepper and 1 tbsp of adobo and used 1/2 c mayo & 1/2 c. s, cream and that was plenty! I didnt fry it either, since we prefer our tacos grilled. My boyfriend didnt care for the hny cumin sauce brushed on the fish. A little too sweet. Other than that great. I will definitly use the mayo again. :) Thanks!

I used halibut and marinated it in the honey-cumin sauce. I grilled the fish instead of battering and frying it and used the leftover marinate to baste the fish as it cooked. My family loved it. The chipolte mayo was great and we didn't think it was too spicy.

Didn't fry the tilapia and didn't use the cabbage and this was still a great recipe. I made some corn salsa (canned corn, red onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice)to top the tacos. The chipotle mayo is delish! Definitely a keeper!!

Great, but the peppers are SPICY for the mayo.  We love spice, but I used one extra and we couldn't eat it, follow the recommended amnt of adobo, or less even!

My whole family loved this meal.  I went easy on the honey-cumin sauce, since the fish was already sweetened by the lime juice in which it 'ceviched' .  The lime juice was more than enough of a counter-balance for the strong heat of the chipotle mayo.

Yum! I couldn't stop eating the tasty chunks of fish!  I made a simple salsa out of "about to go bad" peaches and pears the day before (mixed with lime juice, cilantro and onion) and searched the site for something to put it on. This was a perfect fit!  I did omit the cayenne pepper from the chipotle mayo since the peppers were more than enough spice for my family. I think just about any white fish would work.  I couldn't find fresh, wild Tilapia at my local store so I opted to use Halibut!

This has become a favorite for my husband and I.  I am embarrassed to say I haven't tried the sauce with it yet.  I have been just making a sauce with sour cream & green salsa from Trader Joes (which we think has been great).

Awesome!  Well worth the effort and time to make these.  I first toasted the panko crumbs in a 400 degree oven with a little cooking spray, then coated the talipia and baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes.  They were so crispy and delicious, you wouldn't know they weren't fried! The chipotle mayo was a little too spicy, so I added more mayo and a little lime juice and ended up with a lot of extra, but my husband really liked it so he's been putting it on everything.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The one food I could eat over and over again.  This is by far one of our most favorite recipes.  We don't change a thing except for playing with different kind of fish.  Fabulous with Walleye! If use a mild fish you can get away with marinading for 30 minutes.  First time we made it with walleye the lime was over whelming after marinating for 4 hours.

F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S Fish Tacos!!!  Put this on your bucket list, because they are to die for!!!  I felt like a gourmet chef serving these and everyone raved over them.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  And it was so easy to make.  I used low fat mayo and added chipotle seasonings with some of the cumin honey sauce and tossed that with the cabbage.  They turned out soooooo good.

Not my favorite.  The lime and chipotles are too overpowering.  Probably half of both would be excellent!

These fish tacos were amazing.  I made them and withing a week my family (and extended family) were asking for them again!  They are time consuming, so save it for a weekend meal, but the result is well worth it. The only change I made was to cut the chipotle mayo with some non-fat plain greek yogurt, as the original chipotle mayo was too spicy for me (although other family members loved it the way it was, so I guess it is just a matter of taste). Other than that - it was perfect!

So amazing!  Brushing the honey mixture on was the perfect touch.  LOVED!  The chipotle mayo dressing was also just the best.

Absolutely the best combination of flavors!! Sweet, Tart, Fiery and filling.  My tweaks were adding 1/4 c of Tequila and 1 tsp. of Cumin to the marinade, as found in a similiar recipe; used cod fish because it was on hand; and I also used fresh warm corn tortillas. This recipe is in my permanant cookbook.  Just awesome!

My husband made these tacos when his mother visited us.  They were fabulous! I raved about them to anyone who would listen.  Now I can't wait for him to make them again.  We really loved the fish, though my 4 year old thought the nuggets were a little too sour after being marinated in the lime. An acquired taste, I guess.  Delicious!

AMAZING!!!!!!!! Yum! This was so delicious! I have never made fish tacos before and am so happy I started off with this recipe! It was so flavorful and delicious! All of the combinations of flavors were fantastic together. (I cheated a bit and used ready made breaded fillets, but next time I might make make it exactly as written) I will be coming back to this recipe often!

These were great.  I followed a couple of the suggestions and didn't bread and fry the fish - grilled instead.  They were definitely a crowd pleaser.  The mayo was spicy but very delicious.

This was very good, however, I do agree with a lot of the other reviewers that the chipotle mayo sauce, while good, was way too hot.  And my husband and I DO like our hot, spicy food.  I'd say one chipotle pepper, or even half if you're not particularly into hot food.  Also, I would like more mayo for the slaw to make it creamier.  The fish was delicious with the Panko crumbs and the honey-cumin cilantro mixture was wonderful.  Add the sour cream and some sliced avocado and wow!  With just a few alterations, this is definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was fantastic.  My neighbor is a gourmet cook who just got out of the hospital and I took some tacos to her and she said they were the best fish tacos she's had and she's tried alot of recipes.  Of course she wanted the recipe.  This is a keeper.

This was delicious! I didn't bread the fish, I just pan-fried it, diced it, and then poured the marinade over it.  In my opinion, the marinade is a little too sweet, but it is a PERFECT counterbalance to the spicy coleslaw.  Yum!  Everyone wants me to make it again!

These were "OK". I made this recipe for my bf and I last weekend. We both just returned from San Diego on separate business trips. While my bf was there, he had fish tacos that he really enjoyed. I wanted to recreate them for him (I'm such a nice girlfriend...). Although good, I do not think the end result is worth all of the preparation that is required. I did everything in steps - marinating, honey-cumin sauce and chipotle mayo, then later on, I minced the cilantro, mixed the coleslaw and breaded/fried the tilapia. This made the entire process more manageable (I can't imagine doing it all at once!). I was expecting a lot of flavor, but surprisingly, I could not taste the honey-cumin sauce at all, the fish tasted bland (despite a generous sprinkling of s&p and marinating slightly longer than called for) and the coleslaw mix was spicy, but not much of anything else. I served our tacos in corn tortilas (for authenticity) with a heaping spoonful of pico de gallo and shredded co-jack cheese. Served with tortilla chips on the side, this was a filling meal. One note: 4 servings was more like 8! I made the entire recipe, thinking that 4 servings would be a couple of tacos per person. I had three and my bf had 4 (and we still had tons of fish left over!). At least my bf liked these. Thanks anyways!

These are show stopping tacos...no matter what is going on these get all of the attention! Excellent!  I did not have Panco so substituted crushed garlic pretzels with onion and garlic powder. It added an excellent flavor and was crunchy on the taco!  I doubled the chipotle mayo mix but still used only two chilies.  It was spicy enough!

Delicious recipe, but a little too much cumin for my tastes.  Me and the boyfriend made this together, and even with his help it was still kind of time consuming. Great dish though, to make as a couple. We will definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe, the fish itself was really good...wonder if it was marinating it in lime juice that made the difference.  I made 2 changes...first, I sprayed the breaded fish with non stick spray and baked it for 20 mins. at 425 instead of frying it in oil.  Second, I used chipotle taco seasoning and salsa in the slaw instead of the chipotle pepper and adobe sauce due to the cost.

These were good but the Chipotle Mayo was very hot (I didn't use much of it) and due to the fact this is very time consuming, I probably will not make again.

AWESOME recipe! We usually enjoy extra spicy food, but the use of two chipotle peppers was a bit much, even for us. Next time, we'll go with just one. Otherwise, fabulous!

We used poached white fish with the slaw and chipotle mayo.  It was very tasty.  Because we were just trying to whip something together on a weekend, I didn't have the peppers in adobo sauce so I halved the mayo (which made plenty still!) and substituted a few tablespoons of Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce.

WOW!!! This was unbelieveably good! I am familiar with the chain restaraunt that serves these tacos, and they are my favorite. This recipe is almost a perfect copy, and it was so delicious and easy that hubby and I are making it again tonight (two nights in a row)! 

Be aware that the chipotle chilies in adobo sauce are VERY HOT- the recipe as is was so hot that it made my eyes water and my face red. I just added a little more mayo and cabbage to the mix, and that balanced the heat nicely (although next time I'll only add one pepper instead of two). 

This recipe was also quite fast- it was ready in less than 20 minutes (not including marinating). We served it taco-bar style, with the fish, lime juice for drizzling, the slaw, the honey-cumin sauce for more drizzling, pico from our grocer's salad bar, and chips and salsa on the side. It was a huge hit!

The Tilapia was wonderful.  I just made this again for the 4th time.  I found the directions for the honey cumin sauce and put it on the fish as soon as I took it out of the pan.  FANTASTIC! We love the tilapia done this way.  Thanks!

Wow! This suddenly became one of my favorite recipes on the entire Allrecipes site.  I followed the recipe exactly and have only one suggestion: due to a past bad experience with chipotle peppers I started with only one to test the waters.  Personally I would have used the 2, but I knew it was plenty spicy for who I was serving this to.  I wondered how the honey-lime dressing was going to fit into the flavors, especially when the fish and slaw were so good on their own, but it's just one more element that makes this recipe perfect.  Update: I made these again and though I originally said I followed the recipe exactly the first time, I don't believe I did.  Four hours for fish to be in lime juice?!?! I decided to actually follow the recipe this time, thinking maybe the submitter knew something I didn't.  Well, the fish turned to mush in less than 3 hours, and even after frying the fish it had a sour-lime flavor and a mushy texture that was completely unappetizing. When I make these again I'll marinate about 15 minutes - if at all.

A Must Try! Even if you have never thought of fish tacos as something you would like, do yourself a favor and try these. Followed the recipe exactly and the family has a new favorite. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I didn't make the slaw, just the fish tacos.
The adults thought they were good but the kids did not like the honey-lime cumin sauce. I think it definitely is an aquired taste. 
Maybe if I cut back the cumin it would be more kid friendly.

This was delicious.  I added some lime juice to the coleslaw dressing, just to cut the mayo flavor a little. I also topped mine with a little chopped tomato and shredded cheese. Overall it was really good though!  I will definitely make it again!
