Mint adds an unusual and tasty addition. I made this exactly as written- perhaps a first. I seldom use AR recipes with no reviews, but had everything on hand for this, so I gave it a try. There is no need to heat another pan of water just to cook the garnish tips. Put them in the pureed soup for a few minutes, and then strain them out with a slotted spoon.  The verdict of the recipe as written I would give it 3 stars.  It needed a bit more of something! As I started to serve it, I added another 1 tablespoon of finely chopped mint and another 1 tsp of lemon zest and 1/4 cup of cream.  The egg was pretty as a garnish, but did not add much to the flavor or appearance.  As we ate it, we wondered what it would taste like chilled. I set aside some and tasted it the next day. It was just as yummy and would be refreshing in the summer months and can be made ahead.  This is a good start for a recipe, but tweak it as your taste dictates. As a finished product, I give it 4 stars. Iâ€™ll make it again with changes and probably will serve it chilled.  The serving size and the timing was accurate

I made exactly as written, including the hard boiled egg.  It was delicious and so easy to make!  I thought the egg was an unusual touch but it gave it a nice flavor (and added protein). I loved it so much that I am giving it my very first review.  Thank you for posting it.

Loved it.  I used some scallions instead of shallot because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't add the hard boiled egg, but I would.  Fresh mint and lemon are a wonderful combination.  Very flavorful.

The lemon and mint combination worked well with the asparagus. I skipped the egg and substituted some diced ham.

Turned out pretty good! I had to modify the recipe slightly as I didn't have a lemon and substituted it with a lime. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little zing. Then at the end I added cream....quite tasty.

Amazing light fresh taste. I added the lemon cream from another recipe & some precooked frozen shrimp to a bowl. Delicious!

I did not find the mint flavor appealing. However, this is a good base recipe for asparagus soup.

When I make this, I cut the tips off of all of the spears and set aside.  When the soup has cooked and I've blended it, I return the soup to heat and add the tips for about 5 minutes along with a few cans of sliced mushrooms. I serve with a sliced boiled egg and it's delicious.

I love how quick, easy and absolutely delicious this soup is! I used vegetable stock instead of chicken, and added half a cup of cream at the end. Used cubed Canadian bacon as a garnish.

Forgot the lemon. Made the soup for 16 retired old men, and 4 others. The mint was fresh from my garden. Everyone loved it.

This soup is amazing! I've made it twice now and it is soooo good!! I left out the hard-boiled egg to make it easier too.

I added a diced chicken breast as well. Three people liked it, but my husband was not keen about the egg in it.

Made it as posted except did not add egg garnish.  It was very good, light and flavorful. I loved the mint and citrus flavors with the asparagus.

A winner. Probably the best asparagus soup I have had. I even followed the recipe. Might cut back a bit on lemon zest though. Will make it again for sure. But only made enough for two. ( I usually peel the asparagus too if thick.  Just my preference. ).

Will definitely make again and again.  Easy & delicious!! I made the recipe without alterations. I did add extra dried mint tho.  I loved the egg whites on top and I put few extra lemon curls on top for color, presentation and flavor.  So excited to make and enjoy again!

I added a little cayenne and extra salt for flavoring.  I also added about 1/3 C of cream while it was blending in the food processor.  Next time, I would add more lemon zest because I'm fond of lemon flavor.  It was very good and would be good Easter menu dish.
