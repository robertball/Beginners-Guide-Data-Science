I have been making my oven "fried" chicken this way for many years. (Though I often do not go to the trouble of refrigerating after coating in the buttermilk or after I coat with bread crumbs and it turns out just fine.) This recipe is great just the way it is (not every recipe has to be absolutely bursting with flavor and/or spicy heat, some simpler recipes are great just the way they are - that's what we usually call comfort food! ).  But... it can also be considered a starting point if you choose to leave out or add other herbs, spices or ingredients. One tip, place a cooling rack on a cookie sheet or shallow pan and bake your chicken on the rack. No soggy bottoms! :)

I was the original author of this recipe. I tried most of your suggestions and they really raised the flavor of the meat. As far as the coating falling off, it works better if you use a spatula when you turn and not a fork. Also make sure the panko mixture is dry when you coat. It tends to start getting moist when you roll the meat. Thanks everyone for your reviews!

I used this on thighs (bone-in) and it turned out great!!
Instead of a greased cookie sheet, I used crinkled up (and then sort of flattened) aluminum foil. It helps things like this to get crispy on the bottom, and lets most of the oil drain away. Just shoot a small spot of pam, right where the chicken piece will set, then shoot the top of the piece like the author says to.  Seriously yummy!! Tonight I'm making chicken cordon bleu with this same exact coating. Great recipe!

I make these for my granddaughters,  but I use plain yogurt instead of buttermilk.  I also eliminate the hot pepper sauce.  These are fantastic and way better than McDonald's Chicken Nuggets....and they come with many hugs and kisses from Grandma instead of a useless toy!.

Followed the recipe fairly close. I didn't have cayenne, so subbed chili powder. I added 2 eggs to the marinade to aide in the making the coating stick better. And I added 1/2 C. of coconut just because. As suggested by another, I put parchment paper on a cookie sheet and a cooling rack on that. The chicken was wonderful.

What an easy and fast dish.  Buttermilk is a staple on our house so I had everything on hand. Followed the recipe exactly except cutting it in half for two people.  Very tender inside, crispy on the out side.  Will fix often.

Loved the flavor (I added additional seasonings to suit my taste).  There were just too many steps in the preparation.  I think I was hungry and wanted to eat.

To the buttermilk I added about 1/4 c Franks Wing Sauce. To the bread crumbs (1/2 pinko and 1/2 whole wheat) I added 1 T Italian seasoninha with the rest of ingredients. I baked it on a roasting pan so I wouldn't have to turn it. It did. It turn out crunchy...maybe my oven wasn't hot enough or maybe the 1/2 and 1/2 bread crumb mixture didn't help.  Definitely will make again.

I added a pinch of salt and it still needed way more.  I even made a tonkatsu sauce that went well but without it, it was pretty plain.  Good crunch though!

This is pretty good, but the cook time was way too long.  15 minutes, then 5 minutes after flipping was plenty of time.

WONDERFUL RECIPE! Firstly, I didn't measure out the salt, peppers or Parmesan to mix with the breadcrumbs, I just eyeballed them and it came out great with plenty of flavor to spare. Secondly, I didn't cut up the chicken but instead left the breasts whole. I buy the really thin ones instead of pounding them out with a mallet ( I don't like thick chicken breasts from the oven, I have trouble getting them to cook right) and the chicken was juicy but crisp on the outside- just perfect!

I can see what some of the other comments said about the breading sticking to the pan but I really think it was more my error: I somehow bought the wrong cooking spray and got one made for pastries that had flour in it. I used a tiny bit of olive oil instead and I don't think I coated the bottom of the pan enough before putting it in the oven because one breast came out perfect and the other 3 had varying degrees of sticking and breading falling off and not getting crisp in parts.

 I also DID NOT put my chicken in the fridge once I had breaded it like the recipe calls for, I was in a hurry, not sure if that made a difference as well. 

Next time I'll refrigerate the chicken and use the proper cooking spray and see if that helps.

Not too bad, but seemed like a lot of work for chicken nuggets (yes I did follow the direction and cut them into bite size pieces).  If I do try it again, I'll make it with bigger pieces.  Also as others said, there a bit of difficulty in flipping the pieces and not losing the breading.  With all that, my wife thought the chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I used siracha hot sauce in the butter milk and you could taste it in the finished product which was really nice. But the seasoning otherwise was bland to my family. I'm giving it 4 stars because the "breading" stayed on well which is the downfall to many other recipes. I can always adjust the seasoning next time!

Turned out great. I didn't have buttermilk so just added some lemon juice in milk along with the hot sauce. The final product was great - and the whole family enjoyed it.

Didn't have buttermilk or hot pepper sauce, but used the recommended substitutions, and this came out great. Juicy chicken (cooked them about 15 minutes since I made tenders) with a nice little kick of hot.

We did the lemon juice/whole milk substitute, and I added 1tsp salt. We used a pack of 14 drumsticks, and we could have reduced the breadcrumbs to 1 1/2 cups.  A little hot sauce in the buttermilk is a must.  This made 2 batches in our air fryer, at 20 minutes each.

If I could give 10 stars I would.  I have been on Allrecipes for years and this is my first review.  It is because I was BLOWN away.  I followed the recipe as written but added a little poultry seasoning , thats it.  This was by far the best chicken I have ever made. Husband ate much more than he should have.   We are dark meat people so I did it with thighs.  It did take a tiny bit more cooking time.  I would say Michael is a lucky boy because his momma is one great cook.  Didn't think to take a picture because we ate it all up.

Will definitely add to the rotation!  Followed the recipe as is except I thought I had enough Panko breadcrumbs on hand, but I was short about a cup so I used Italian breadcrumbs to fulfill the quantity needed.  I think this added to the flavoring overall as some people suggested it was slightly under seasoned, but I'm not sure.  I was going to skip refrigerating after breading them but I didn't and I do think that added step to firm up the breading on the chicken before baking helps the breading stay on during the cooking/flipping process.   Great flavor overall, a nice little kick from the cayenne pepper!

I followed the recipe, except I used a plastic bag for the bread crumb mixture. Way too much onion and garlic powder . The buttermilk marinade was great. The chicken was nice and moist. I put the nuggets on a rack and they didn’t brown much. I will use the buttermilk again, but will cut way down on the spices.

Super easy and very good. I made it with leg and thigh. Awesome. I also made pork chops with left over marinade and bread crumb mix. Also very good.  Will make this many times over. Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice and pretty easy to make. The result was a tray of tender and juicy chicken tenders with a flavorful crunch. 

I'm a novice cook, so I rely on other reviews and helpful advice for every recipe. I followed the recipe as well as some of the  adjustments recommended. I'll definitely be making this often now that I have the basics down. 

1) Swapped 1tsp of the onion powder for garlic powder
2) Added 1tsp salt to the panko mixture
3) Added 1TBSP Italian seasoning
4) Used a strainer to shake off as much of the buttermilk mixture as possible before breading.
5) Cooked the strips on a rack instead of on a tray or on foil
6) Sprayed with coconut oil instead of Pam
7) Opted for the shorter cook time (15min on each side)

Used two large chicken breasts, made my buttermilk with milk and vinegar  with 1/2 of the milk  with lots to share.  Covered cookie sheet with foil and used racks to sit chicken on. Turned after 15 mins. Quite good ...used with plum sauce but will try  honey mustard sauce next time. Lots of chicken left over

Delicious ! I have made this two times. The first time it wasn't crispy . The second time I forgot to add the Parmesan grated cheese , coated the bottom of the pan with olive oil and the result was very crispy! Regardless , my family is very pleased with this recipe . Definitely a keeper .

This is delicious. I used four bone-in chicken breasts, and I didn't have time to marinade so I just dipped them in the buttermilk mixture and coated with the crumb mixture. Since they were bone-in I baked at 375 degrees for 45-50 minutes, turning them halfway through.  It turned out great! I also used freshly grated Parmesan in mine.

I read the reviews and used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk because that's what I had. I omitted the parmesan as it didn't seem necessary. I added salt to the panko mix. Marinated for 50 minutes. I did not return it to the fridge after coating. I also did not turn over half way through cooking, as it browned very nicely. I baked it on cast iron. It was delicious! It held together great. It was cooked very well and yet very moist! I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe and would give it a 4+.  The cayenne gave the chicken a bit of heat that my family enjoyed.  The only change I made was adding my own bread crumbs to the mixture when I ran out of panko crumbs. I will make this again.

This was a great weeknight dinner.  I threw the buttermilk into a baggie with the chicken before work in the a.m.  Rather than cutting the chicken in bite size pieces, I just cut by BLSL chicken breasts in half.   When I got home, I coated the chicken, as directed.  I appreciated the reviews that said they found the recipe a little bland. Since my family likes more flavor, I added some poultry seasoning and other family favorites to the coating.  Threw it in the fridge while I changed my clothes. I did use parchment paper on my baking sheet and cooking spray as per the directions.  My chicken turned out crispy.) Popped it in the oven and it was ready to eat with little fuss.  My husband commented on how much he loved it.  My little one cut hers into bite size pieces and thought they were homemade chicken nuggets.  Served with refrigerator mashed potatoes and steamed fresh green beans for an easy weeknight meal. Will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good, but got done much quicker than recipe said.  I don't know why the recipe says to cut the chicken in chunks, which I did not do.  I use three small boneless breasts.  Next time cut breading and marinate in half for the amount of chicken we use.  I baked it on parchment paper and turned half way through and it was very crispy.

Came out tasty, though probably due to my cooking skills, it was more baked chicken than fake fried. Would make again!

Potentially tasty. There was way too much Panko so that the other ingredients were lost. Could hardly taste Parmesan. I would use a lot less Panko and keep the other ingredients as they are. I threw out at least one and a half cups of the coating mix afterward. I will try again with above changes.

I followed the recipe to the "t" and unfortunately didn't have much success.  The breading was well seasoned but did need some salt - no salt indicated in the recipe.  It did not stay on the chicken, instead it slid off and ended up in the baking dish.  Also, it took much longer than the 30 minutes to bake.

Made exactly as directed. Simple to make but must plan ahead for 1 hour of marinating and 30 minutes in fridge plus 15 minutes prep and about 45 minutes of cooking. Yup, 2 1/2 hours or so!
Tasty, low fat, but would leave out the cayenne pepper (optional) next time.

This one is definitely a keeper! The only change to this recipe was he way I cut the chicken.  Instead of chunks I cut it more like chicken tenders. It came out nice nd crispy with just enough spice from the cayenne I mixed the honey mustard sauce for dipping.

Tried this chicken out last night.  Hubby really liked it.  We dipped in Ranch Dip.  I followed the directions and ingredient amounts to a tee.  But, I think next time I will mix in a bit of saltine cracker crumbs to the panko mixture to see if that doesn't give it enough crunch.  I had to put the chicken under the broiler to get the coating crunchy as I wanted.  I broiled each side of he chicken for a few minutes.  The taste was terrific and DH my a comment of how good it was without any prompting from me.  That doesn't happen very often, LOL.  I will be making this again.

I do not know what I did wrong, but my chicken did not look crispy as in the photo accompanying the recipe, in fact, the coating was very soft.  However, my husband complimented the taste and they were very tender.  My sole deviation from the recipe was not to cut my very small, thin pieces of chicken into strips.  The thin breasts I buy have already been trimmed to 4 to 6 oz.

I will without doubt make again.  I didn't have onion powder so used a chicken seasoning Spice with oregano onion powder cayenne pepper in it.  I'm ceoliac so replaced crumbs with crushed rice crispies. Unfortunately there was no butter milk available so followed your advice regarding milk and white vinegar..using white wine vinegar. It was extremely tasty although did stick to the oiled parchment. A definate repeat to follow..

I noticed that there was no call for salt, but made it as directed. Very, very good and I didn't even miss the salt. I did cut the hot sauce in half and the cayenne in half. I'm a tender foot palate  but it still had a nice little kick.

I am confused it says cut chicken into bite size pieces????  This would take alot of time to bread each small piece and it is not what the picture looks like.

Next time I make I will add italian seasoning, more pepper and some oregano for some more flavor.  Chicken was moist, but I would have liked it to be a bit crispier.

I made it just like the recipe and it turned out to be very moist and tasty, however, it did need some salt.

this was very good. I forgot to spray cooking spray before baking it. but the breading crust was crisp so it wasn't missed.  

in my personal opinion the meat was a bit bland. it need more salt and pepper...maybe the cayenne pepper. I wasn't able to spice it up due to sensitive palates in my family. 

the family complimented the dish. it's a do over again.
