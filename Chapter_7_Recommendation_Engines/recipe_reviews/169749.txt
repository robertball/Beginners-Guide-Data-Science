Very easy to make and delicious! After cutting the pork, I placed the slices between two pieces of wax paper and gently pounded it down to the desired thickness. I doubled the sauce which was positively wonderful the balsamic and capers complimented each other nicely. Thanks for a great recipe Marianne!

This is my recipe, and I have an update for you.  I made this tonight using a replacement for the chicken broth:  the dark, wonderful, gelatinous broth that is left from the Roast Sticky Chicken from this site.  It made the sauce rich and more flavorful.  I highly recommend it!  You may need to add a little more broth for the ratio of vinegar:broth because it is thicker.  Very tasty indeed!

Hey Marianne! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!! I made it excatly as it was written and my family loved it! PS. We are the Caper Gueens! Princessjenna told me about it and what a life saver because I usaually marinate and grill pork tenderloin.. to cold outside. This would also be good with chicken..says my son. Thanks for the great recipe!  UPDATE: I used a pork loin and cut it very thin. The medallions were bigger but just as tender and delicious!

Good, solid dish.  I would recommend cooking the pork roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes before slicing and pan frying.  When one merely pan-fries after dredging in oil, the outsides get crispy and blacken before the inside of the meat can cook, which results in improperly cooked meat.  If you wait too long, though, the sauce reduces too much to be sufficient to cover the medallions.  Other than those small things, the flavor of this dish is really good.  I liked the sauce a lot - robust, but not overpowering, and delicious without being too creamy.

Awesome sauce!  I made this like the recipe said.  the only thing I did do was add one more cup of chicken broth and a tbls of cornstartch and soy sauce to thicken the sauce a bit more right at the end.  the combination of Balsamic Vinegar, lemon and broth with capers was so odd, yet the flavor was truely awesome.  I'll use it on beef as well.  Very good thanks for sharing!

I served this at a gourmet dinner and everyone raved. I wanted to prepare it beforehand, so I didn't cook the meat all the way through. I put the medallions in a baking dish and made the sauce. I poured the sauce over the meat and put it all in the fridge. I baked it about 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven and it was terrific. I served it with the Carrot Rice recipe from this site. Will definately be making this again.

Thank you Marianne for a great recipe. I am much more of a baker than a cook but this dinner made me look really good. I was a little nervous in the beginning but it turned out great. Thanks again. Btw, I doubled the sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe.

We love this! I used less, balsamic, and added some white wine. I also didn't use the lemon zest, personal preference. Fabulous! Thanks Marianne ♥

This was so good!  Everyone really liked this one.  I made the recipe exactly the only thing I change was using boneless pork chops and they worked like a charm.  I just pounded them a little thinner.  Thanks for sharing Marianne.  I will make this again.

Good but needed a little more balance to the sauce and salt at the end to cut the acid.  Used twice the amount of stock and 1 1/2 times the capers(they don't cook long enough in the sauce to release their salt).  My family liked it overall but felt it needed less lemon(the predominant) flavor, more balsamic and more salt.

Oh my, these were SO good.  I increased the amount of capers, because I didn't think there was enough.  Then placed a thin layer of the sauce in the middle of a small plate, put the medallions on top, and more sauce on top.  The presentation looked like it came from a restaurant, and they tasted like it, too!  

One thing, though.  I cooked this twice, the first time exactly like the recipe said.  It took FOREVER to get 1.5 inch thick medallions to cook through.  The second time, I sliced them about 3/4-inch, and STILL had to cook them an extra 5 minutes or so.

If the cooking directions had been more accurate, I would have given five stars.

This was delicious! The only changes I made were to pound out the medallions before pan frying and also added about a half a cup of white wine to the sauce. My husband absolutely loved it!

Yummy...this was simple and delicious. The measurements were perfect, the sauce reduced nicely and the flavors were well-balanced. I didn't use garlic salt, just garlic and I flattened the medallions just a bit before I dredged and cooked it. AND...I had this done and waiting before my asparagus finished roasting! Also served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe, Marianne.

Excellent! This will definitely be making regular appearances on our dinner table. I used a really strong balsamic vinegar, and as it was cooking, I was afraid the sauce might overpower the dish... but it turned out fantastic! Paired great with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. Also, I used a gluten-free flour blend with no issue.

wonderful, easy, delicious, elegant, what else? How about, what took me so long to make this? Now that I have and now that my daughter and I couldn't stop with the...mmmmmm's...you can bet it will be made more often. Followed these easy and simple directions to a T. No need to make any changes whatsoever. Thanks Marianne, it's a winner.

Marianne, this is OUTSTANDING!  I would give it more stars if possible.  The sauce was amazing.  I had never cooked with capers before, but they blended in with the sauce so nicely.  I will be using them more often now.  My husband came in the kitchen while I was preparing it and asked what I was cooking that smells so good!   To top it off, this dish is so quick and easy to fix it would be good on a weeknight.  This one is a winner.  We will definitely be making it again in the future.

A great recipe.  Easy to fix and my wife was impressed.  I used a heavy balsalmic vinegar(#15) so I cut it by 1/2 and added a 1/4 cup vermouth or white wine.  I also added 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms when I added the capers

TEN STARS Fantastic!  It also works with pork chops.  I doubled the sauce and use more capers.  I also sprinkled additional lemon zest on top of the finished pork for a nice presentation.

I didn't flour the medallions (I do not care for the texture like this) and just browned them with the garlic sauce in oil.  Otherwise, the only other thing I did differently is to double the sauce per the recommdations of others.  It's so yummy; it was perfect with couscous.

Wow, wow, wow! I made this with two super-thick pork chops and was worried about cooking them thoroughly, so after coating with the flour mixture and browning them for 3 min on each side, I added a can of chicken broth, covered and let simmer for 40 min. I then added 2/3 cup of balsamic vinegar (since I had doubled the chicken broth, I doubled the vinegar), let simmer for 10 min so the balsamic could soak in, then followed the rest of the recipe (doubling zest and capers). It was so good and had an elegant flair. I made mashed potatoes and baked asparagus on the side and drizzled the sauce over everything. Last week, I made the smothered pork chops (also from allrecipes) which I gave 5 stars and my husband said that was 5 star comfort food and this was 5 star fancy food. I will be making this the next time we have company and expect to get rave reviews.

TENDER & FLAVORFUL!  This is another excellent recipe, Marianne; it was "melt in your mouth good"!   We loved the capers and balsamic sauce.  My only change was to use 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 3/4 tsp. salt as I didn't have garlic salt.  The recipe was easy to follow and I found all the times were perfect.  Thank you Marianne for sharing this TENDER & FLAVORFUL recipe!  I will be making it again.

I saved this recipe quite some time ago but every time I came across it I didn't feel the time was right. Well, the time came when I decided it was as good of time as any and the only reget I have is that I didn't make it sooner. We truly enjoyed this. The combination of the vinegar and capers completely compliments the pork. I added extra capers due to personal tastes but this is the only change I made. Thank you Marianne for making my special night all the more meaningful with this fabulous meal!

Great recipe!  I reduced the lemon zest & capers by half in case hubby didn't like the tartness.  Just right for us, but would have had great wow factor if full strength.  Based on reviews, I doubled the chicken broth, used 1/2 c. balsamic and 1/2 c. white wine, and thickened with corn starch.  Served with wild rice.

Four adults voted this 5++++. Thanks, Marianne! Update: made this twice this week after 5 yrs..why did I wait so long?  Can make ahead & gently reheat. Love suggestion of using chicken breasts.

This recipe was a total hit with the family.   I sliced the pork tenderloin into thinner pieces (1/4"-1/2" slices) and it made it easy to control and cook evenly.    And note that the sauce is really only barely enough for ONE tenderloin (1 lb+).   So you may want to double it if you like more sauce.  It's a great base sauce and a nice alternative to the balsamic is using marsala wine if you want to mix it up on occasion.   Great with or without the capers (if you're not a big capers fan).   Also fun with mushrooms in the sauce.  Lots of options here and quick enough for a weeknight!

excellent!!! I doubled the sauce as others had said too. Was pretty good even though i cut up really fatty pork chops i had in the freezer. Very surprised that something so easy was sooooo delicious! It did make my house smell of vinegar but the pork did not taste too much of vinegar. I served with red mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This dish was even a hit with my boyfriend who absolutely hates capers. Great recipe!!! THANKS!

Absolutely fantastic.  We didn't even end up using the sauce (lemon caper) once it was all said and done, just because the pork was wonderful without it!  My husband said it should be served at a restaurant!  And he is not very liberal with his compliments! :)  I tried the sauce on a few pieces- it is great.  Just not necessary.  Save yourself a few ingredients and just make the pork using the broth & balsamic.  I did have to add more chicken broth during cooking.  Keep it handy.

This was absolutely dee-lish!  The pork (same cut and brand that I always buy) was soooo tender, and the sauce was very flavorful  I didn't change a thing about the original recipe.  I might make a double batch of the sauce next time, it was so nice to be able to spoon a puddle onto each plate and set the meat onto it.  I can't wait to make it again and  serve it to family and friends.

Update 11 12 18  I am making this tonight for about the 20th time.  We love this dish.  I always double the amount of sauce ingredients.  Otherwise I don't change a thing. I always serve it with baked sweet potatoes and a roasted veg, tonight it's prepared, vacuum packed organic beets.  First time for those.  Bon Apetit!!

Sauce was good. Pork by itself is blah. I doubled the zest and capers, and added a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it. That helped. Without the sauce, which is how my kids wanted it, the pork really doesn't taste like much. But, like so many dishes, I guess it's the sauce that makes the dish! I may make again, but not soon.

A definite five star recipe ......   I had never cooked pork before (until 6 months ago, when memsahib became unwell, I had never cooked at all) ... and so was just a bit apprehensive.  Followed the instructions almost to the letter, but added some mushrooms in the sauce at the end of play, so to speak.  Memsahib was totally enchanted by the assorted flavours contained in the sauce, and the succulence of the meat, which was left tender and juicy.  Many thanks .... and saludos de Espana  Highlander

My wife and I both enjoyed this dish very much. It was easy to make and very flavorful. I served it over a bed of rice and a side of mixed vegetables, it turned out to be a great meal. I will be making this again sometime soon.

This recipe is quick, easy AND affordable! Best of all it is DELICIOUS! To the reviewers that say the pork is plain without the sauce, of course it is! It's pork with flour, salt and pepper! What do you expect to taste like? YES! The sauce makes it!!! We will definitely be having this again! SOON! And the leftovers are yummy too! :-)

Very Good!  I made half of this recipe, but made the full amount of sauce.  I wanted to see if this could basically be done ahead of time and reheated just before serving, so I went about this a little differently. I followed the recipe, but once the meat was cooked through, I took it out of the pan so it wouldn’t over cook and finished the sauce with a cornstarch/water slurry and a pat of butter.  I let everything cool somewhat and then returned the pork to the pan, covered it and put it in the fridge.  I reheated it gently just before serving, turning the pork over once, to get it heated through a little faster .  My little experiment worked beautifully which makes this a wonderful recipe to use for entertaining.  And did I mention that it’s delicious?!  Just as a personal preference, the only change I would make next time would be to omit the flour.  Thanks Marianne for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Excellent as is although I didn't have any lemon zest so I substituted with 1/2 tsp lemon extract (normal would be 1 tsp but I wanted it not so lemony). I used butterflied boneless pork chops.  A few reviewers commented that it was a bit too acidic because of the vinegar.  The fault lies not in too much balsamic, but in a poor quality.  The longer balsamic ages, the sweeter it gets.  I have a 25 year old balsamic that can be used easily in desserts.  So look for an aged balsamic.

I cooked this yesterday and received great compliments from everyone at my late lunch/early dinner.  Had a total of 9 people, so doubled everything - and added mushrooms to the sauce.  A big hit!!!  Served the pork/sauce atop brown rice and accompanied with steamed broccoli, and baked sweet potatoes.  A great meal that is simple, quick, attractive, and most importantly: very tasty.  Will have the FEW left-overs tonight.  I'll definitely cook this again.  Might vary the sides, but the pork is the star here.

Easy and flavorful.  I did add a little cornstarch slurry at the end to tighten up the sauce because of timing issues although I had reduce the sauce significantly.  I wish I had added just a little butter to mellow out the sauce.  Overall a good dish.

My cooking time was considerably longer than the recipe states, but after all was said and the dish hit the table it was ALL GOOD! My son swears it was the best pork he's ever had, and he's had his share just from all my BBQ and smoking and such. Great combination of flavor lemon and capers create, I'm a fan!

What a great recipe! My whole family enjoyed it, and it took very little time or effort. I would definitely serve this to company. Like some others suggested, I pounded the meat and doubled the sauce.

This is a good recipe.  BUT you have to use a good vinegar.  I always read the "lousy" reviews before I try something, and for this one, there were complaints of "too vinegary", or "sour".  All Balsamic is not created equal, and if you're buying your balsamic off the shelf at the grocery store, you're getting a harsh, acidic, sour product that will ruin even the best recipes.  Balsamic is definitely one of those things that is worth the extra effort and expense.

Very tasty! It was also quick and easy, all top qualifications in my book! I wasn't sure if DH would like it because he doesn't like basalmic, but he tasted the sauce then picked up the pan and poured it all over his chops!

My husband really liked this, which is rare for him with pork. I also liked it but he REALLY liked it. I did have to cook mine longer as my meat was still bleeding in the recommended amount of time but it's possible that I made my slices too thick, as I just guesstimated and didn't use a ruler or anything to measure. Served with rice and green beans, this was a fancy-looking meal that didn't take a lot of effort to turn out. Thanks, Marianne!

Very tasty dish. I used pork chops instead as I realised I didn't have tenderloins only after I decided I was going to make this for dinner... Also omitted capers - couldn't find a small jar... all in, I enjoy the balsamic vinegary taste although I had to add in some sugar to mellow it down a little as my husband doesn't like it very sour... would like to try it with capers when I can get my hands on smaller jars.

Ehhh, it was okay. I normally love the dishes that get 4-5 stars.  I should have gone with my gut and thrown my nice and crispy medallions in the oven to finish them off.  Then made the sauce to serve with it.  By braising the medallions, they get soggy and the nice crust peels off.  Gross.  I knew better.  If you like this sort of thing, just follow the directions exactly.

We liked this recipe very much. I followed the recipe exactly. I am very pleased with the ease and quickness of this dish. The pork was so tender and flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

It was good. But it wasn't great. I think too much lemon for my taste. Will make again but half the lemon

This was very tasty. The flavors blend nicely and we really enjoyed such a nice dish without a bunch of fuss. The only problem I had might have been my fault but when I added the balsamic/broth combo to the skillet that stuff went everywhere. Popped and splattered at least a foot in every direction. No one else has mentioned this so I'm not sure what happened but I'll turn down the heat next time before adding. I used pork loin because it's what I had and cut it about 1" thick. I'm sure this will be even better when I get a tenderloin.

We loved this very much. It's easy to prepare too. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Nasturtium pods instead of capers. I especially like the fresh taste the lemon zest gave to the finish. This recipe is going into my pork meal rotation in the "my menus" section of AR. Thanks Marianne. We Loved it! BTW, served with steamed broccoli and baked potatoes.

This is perfect - and so easy. In truth, it took me longer to get a decent photo of it than it did to make it. I doubled the recipe, like the smart girl I am. Be careful not to dredge your pork too much - I got mine a little more thickly coated than I wanted. Just a nice, fine layer will give you plenty of browning and thicken your sauce plenty. The sauce is incredible. Thanks for the recipe, Marianne!!! :)

Awesome recipe! This has been in my recipe box for a while but something just didn't sound right about it so it took me a long time to finally make it. What was I waiting for? I rarely follow a recipe exactly but I do for this one. The whole family loves it.

I have waited a long time to try this recipe because I was leery of the capers.  I bought the capers about 6 months ago, and still didn't try it thinking they may taste like olives, which we don't care for.  Well, I bit the bullet tonight and tried this recipe.  Ha, I should not have waited so long.  It turns out, my DH and I both liked the capers as they didn't taste like olives.  I downsized the recipe using 2 pork loin chops and didn't measure my lemon zest.  I just zested the lemon right over the pan.  The sauce is really good with this recipe and I think next time, I might like it served with mashed potatoes.  Thanks, Marianne for sharing your recipe.  We enjoyed dinner tonight.

Delicious! I omitted the capers and lemon and just used the balsamic and broth. Divine. Next time I'll double the sauce. It would be good with onions, garlic and mushrooms added. Potatoes and rice on the side.

Wonderful and easy to make.  Even my 7 year old eats this (except for the capers for some reason).  I have used a couple different types of infused balsamic vinegars' and it is always great.

This tasted really good!  But I happen to LOVE balsamic vinegar.  My husband and kids thought it was just ok as they tend to prefer plainer food.  I will probably make this again, but for a dinner party for friends rather than  for my boring food loving family!

I made this for my fiance and we both loved it.  I did have to cook the pork longer than suggested to make sure it was done.  But the combination of the balsamic vinegar and the capers made for a delicious sauce.  I served it all over mashed potatoes which as a nice compliment.

Very tasty dish!  I got this recipe by email yesterday in the Daily Dish, which is what prompted me to make it since I had taken out pork tenderloin!  Easy to make, and the sauce is very unique and yummy.  Enjoyed this with nice green salad!

I feel badly giving this 3 stars when so many good cooks have raved but... the sauce was so sour, with a vinegar "bite" to it.  The meat was very tender and as I was trying to get the sauce to reduce, I kept tasting.  I tried to mellow it by adding butter to the sauce, then more chicken broth.  Finally called my grandson (a chef) who suggested adding sugar to it.  Even after a couple of TBSPS of sugar and some cornstarch to thicken (could not get it to reduce properly), the sauce was still sour.  I wish I could figure out what the problem was.

I found this was missing Flavor!! the sauce is good but unless you drown your meat in it I didn't find it very exciting and the BF asked me not to make it again... that never happens.

Absolutely awesome.  The only change I made was to accomadate what was in the freezer.  I used thin sliced chops cut to medallion size. It is one I will definately serve to family and as a special treat for guests. Thank you Audrey

For those few people who felt the dish is too salty, just substitute garlic powder (or fresh minced garlic) for the garlic salt, and be sure to use low-sodium broth.

Absolutely fantastic! I cooked this yesterday for my family, who are very picky eaters. Didn't get any complaints from any one, which in my family is a tremendously good sign. Good job with this one, Marianne!

Made as directed. If you do not like capers leave them out. Sauce was excellent until I added the capers and realized I dont like them and tossed the sauce down the drain. They have such a strong flavor they took over.

This recipe is outstanding!  Easy for a weeknight dinner and fancy for guests.  Definately substitute the broth with wine - I used Chardonnay and the blend was perfect.  Serve with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and you won't be sorry!

Easy, flavorful recipe.  The balsamic vinegar, lemon zest, and capers all bring a wonderful Mediterranean flavor to the dish.  The only changes is after I cut the medallions from a whole pork loin (we buy lots of pork loin roasts when it is on sale for 1.99#) I beat it thin with my meat beater/hammer thing, to about 1/4 inch so it was just so tender it melted in your mouth, and inspired by the other flavors, I added some fresh oregano.  I served with roasted garlic red potatoes and a Greek salad.  Oh, this is definitely a keeper!

My DH makes a similar recipe with veal and it is fab so I decided to try this for pork tenderloin.  I'd have to say it is my absolute favourite way to eat tenderloin now.  It is so tender and flavourful and I find it quite balanced.  In my opinion it is perfection as is but  I have made it quite a few times now and the only thing I change from the recipe is to add some chopped shallots before adding the liquid.

The only change I made was to make extra sauce, as recommended by others, and I'm glad I did. It was great with horseradish mashed potatoes.
I will be making this again.

I added some butter to the sauce and marinated my pork tenderloin in balsamic and black pepper for a couple hours before slicing.

It is not a hard recipe to follow, it looks beautiful. I liked it, but it is very rich - lots of new flavors. After I make a meal, I ask the family, "should I make it again"? There answer was no. I do encourage you to try it. My family is odd... they are not into fancy... they might have thought the gravy was just too fancy. The gravy was not the flavors they are use too.

Very good.  Didn't have capers but didn't matter, it was still very good and the meat was very tender.  I seasoned the pork directly with the garlic/salt/pepper, other than that, didn't change a thing.  Will make again.

Made first for hubby then for dinner guests. It was a hit both times. Making it for our New Years dinner this time
Didn't change recipe - did slice my tenderloin while mostly frozen. Much easier to cut then.

All in our family of picky eaters liked this.  I doubled the chicken broth to make more sauce.  For 1 1/2 inch medallions it took me closer to 10 minutes or so to cook even after the initial sear.  We'll add this to our rotation.

I don't know what I did wrong becauseI followed the recipe to a T.   The only thing i think might have made it so bad  was my Kirklands Balsamic  vinegar.  It had been in my pantry about a year and was not expired.   it was way too sour, and the presentation was not pretty.   A dark brown.. I did as another person, made mashed potatoes and fresh streamed broccoli .  I doubled the sauce recipe as others had done.  I wish I could figure out  what the problem was.

Absolutely loved this dish.  Fast and easy to make and would be great on a busy night.   Since we were not eating right away I put the meat back into the fry pan after the sauce had thickened.   Will be making again.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe

Pretty yummy!  Used thin cut pork,  lemon pepper then finished with lemon juice.  Double the sauce.  You really need to be a "vinegar" person or this could be too strong for some folks.

Restaurant quality. Delicious quick, and easy. This is a winner every time I make it. I always double the sauce because everyone likes to sop it up with bread! It is very rich, so go with lighter sides to balance it out.

We enjoyed this very much. The balsamic made a great sauce but we wondered if the lemon zest needed to be there. It was a very dominant flavour. Might try it without next time. Also, may have added more broth as we wanted more sauce!

I have made this several times now.  The recipe as stated is the best.  However, I have had to substitute at times and it still is good.  Have used orange zest instead of lemon, and the capers are a good addition, but works okay without them.  Also increased the simmer time as I used 1/2 inch bone-in pork chops.

Marianne, this was delicious!! I followed the recipe but hubs is off pork for a while and made it with thin sliced chicken. This is a keeper and will make this again soon! Hubs loved it, too!! While not necessary, I might try using white wine in lieu of broth some time. This is simple enough for a week night and elegant enough for company! Thank you!

Easy, delicious, sufficiently impressive for serving to dinner guests.
I prepared it the first time as written; more recently, I took a reviewer's suggestion of transferring the "crispy" medallions to the oven while completing the sauce. Both methods worked for me!  I also wondered if it would work with chicken breast medallions, so I tried it....same ingredients, same procedure. It also works.

This is a standard "company" recipe in our house. I make it just as the recipe indicates, except I usually pound the medallions to desired thickness before breading and I always double the delicious sauce. Sometimes I add 1/2 cup red wine to the sauce. It "holds" well; I often make it ahead and either reheat or keep warm. I always make enough for leftovers to enjoy the next night or freeze for later!

Marianne, this is WONDERFUL! I made this exactly as written, except for doubling the chicken broth b/c I wanted extra sauce, and using more capers. The combination of flavors here is really spectacular...nothing overpowers anything else, just a perfect blend of deliciousness! Hubby raved over this and said that this should get more then 5 stars, I agree! I will be making this one a lot~YUM! Thanks, Marianne! :)

Love this recipe. I added some sautéed artichoke hearts, a smidgen of red wine and some feta cheese on top to give it even more Mediterranean flavor. Entire family loved it - even the 8 year old who dubiously asked what a caper was.

Yum! Only issue was it took longer to cook than stated.  I cut the pork to 1 1/2 inches but perhaps they were too thick. Had to add a little water as the sauce was cooking down too much witht he added cook time.  Will definitely make again, but with a bit thinner medallions.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare with a delightful complexity of flavor that was very easy on the palette.  I made it with skinless, boneless chicken breast.  I pounded the chicken slightly so it wasn't to thick and used white wine in place of the chicken broth.  I didn't time the length of time I simmered the vinegar, but enough to reduce it to a slightly think sauce. Defiantly a "Go To" recipe.

Hi, this was a great hit with the family.  I wasn't sure if balsamic plus lemon would work, but it really did.  I added a bit of brown sugar to take the edge off the vinegar and also mixed a little cornflour with the (cool) chicken broth so that the sauce thickened up and coated the meat well.

If you in a hurry turn the heat up for the sauce but dont leave it & stir constantly. I did then added a cornstarch slurry bc I listened to reviews (mistake) & ended up with too thick of a sauce & had to add water. But the sauce turned out wonderful added mushrooms. When reducing a sauce you cant go by a recipe bc stoves vary, learn your stove! This recipe was awesome!!!

Wow!  Unexpectedly tender, and the lemon zest finished off the sauce perfectly!  I'm not much of a cook, and this truly a quick and easy recipe, even for me! My husband and kids loved it!

THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC!!  Made this with chicken instead of pork (thought I had pork but didn't) and doubled the sauce as per others suggestions.  Dredged and browned the chicken, then put the sauce ingredients into the pan and placed everything into the oven to finish the chicken.  Used a cornstarch slurry to tighten the sauce up at the very end.  My husband, who is not a big fan of balsamic vinegar loved this recipe, so it's a keeper in my books!

I made this following the directions but used Pork Sirloin chops instead of medallions (to lazy to cut them into medallions) and it was excellent.  I used a ginger/fig Balsamic vinegar and it had a wonderful flavor.  My husband loved this dish, and he is not a fan of balsamic vinegars!
So good!

I think this is one of the best recipes I have ever tried. Very few ingredients. Very rich; even though it was low in fat. Thank you so much. I have saved this to favorites and can't wait to have company delight in this 5 star recipe.

I used whole chops that I diced, garlic powder instead of the salt variety, leftover champagne in lieu of the chicken broth and two oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes I had leftover to make up for some of the capers as I didn't have the full tablespoon. We just didn't care too much for this though it sounded really good. Served it with rice and veggies sauteed in garlic butter.

This was really tasty. I didnt cut mine into medallions, just cut into 1 inch cubes. I also didnt dredge in flour, and they still turned out delicious!

Oh dear ... here I stand alone ... perhaps is was the balsamic vinegar I used, but just not for us.  So so sorry - it sounded delish  -  too salty w/quite heavy vinegar base - again, perhaps just our taste buds as we've eliminated quite a bit of salt in our diet recently.

WOW! I didn't dredge the pork but did add a bit of flour at the end to give some body to the sauce.  I cooked for 2 with 10 oz of tenderloin. I seared the meat on all sided before cutting into medallions.   Used 1/4 cup vinegar and added 1/2 cup white wine.  I couldn't find the capers and then spaced on  the lemon.  But still, WOW!  Served over cream cheese mashed potatoes with "Greens with Cannellini Beans".  Forgive my adjustments, Marianne, but  thanks for a delicious dinner.

Delicious!  I love almost anything with balsamic vinegar and this really hit the spot.  I left out the capers due to personal preference but that is the only change I made.  I will be making this again.  Thank you Marianne!

I had to come up with a meal for unexpected guests last night and had just read this recipe.  I had no pork tenderloin, but I had BS chicken breasts so I sliced each one across and prepared them exactly like your pork.  It was so delicious -  the capers and balsamic vinegar work so well together.  I can't wait to try it with tenderloin next.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were amazing!!!!  I am not a pork fan but had some in the freezer I need to use up so this was the recipe.  I am now a big fan of pork and will be making this recipe often.  The flavors melded together very well.  The capers and the balsamic give it a nice sweet tangy flavor.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made this several weeks ago and forgot to rate it..Marianne, this is PERFECT.  I usually have extra capors from my own chicken cacciatore. PERFECT!  I admit that I added white wine and this was just d'bomb.

LOVED this sauce!!!  Next time though I think I'll just brown the medallions without the flour.  Personal preference for texture.  Then add a little flour slurry to sauce to thicken it up.  All in all a fantastic recipe!  Will make a again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really flavorful and tender!  My husband and I both loved this.  I went heavy on the lemon zest and capers since we both like that extra zing!  I served the pork on a bed of rice and it was really pretty.  This would be an impressive and easy company dish.  We will definitely have this again.

On a whim my fiance chose this recipe when I told him I was going to make pork chops. The cooking time was slightly less just because I used chops and they were thin. I didn't flour the pork just seasoned them nicely and added a little flour to the sauce after removing the pork. The taste was yummy and the sauce thickened perfectly. Served with rice and green beans. Delicious!! Thank you!

My husband hasn't stopped raving about my gourmet meal, "the best pork tenderloin (medallions) he's ever had"! I wouldn't change one thing about this recipe. I served asparagas with toasted black sesame seeds, and oven roasted red potatoes with garlic, lemon zest, and parmaesan cheese.

This was very good.  The only things I changed were to add a teaspoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of white wine to the sauce, since I was afraid the vinegar would be too overpowering.  But it really wasn't, and the meat was very tender.  I'll be making this again.

I thought this was very good and made the recipe exactly as listed. Drives me crazy when people review a recipe and state they made a bunch of changes. Stick to reviewing the recipe as is please! I would suggest doubling the sauce so you have extra, so delicious.

I followed the recipe with no changes except to finely grate rather than mince the lemon zest .  It is an elegant, simple and quick dish to prepare!  My wife loved it and we mark it as a definite "do again".

This was easy, but it was very heavy on the salt. I didn’t get much of the lemon since the balsamic and the capers were so strong.

I use pork loin steaks as this is what I have to hand, is a similar cut and cheap here in the U.K.. Like other reviewers suggested I also double the stock amount. The 2nd time I made this I used ‘Knorr’ pork stock which have a delicious pork depth to the sauce.

I made this today for Father's Day...yes dad loved it as did all of us!
Followed Michelle advice and made Roasted Sticky Chicken from this site. Doubled sauce, next time I will triple sauce. Also pounded the pork slices. Quick and delicious. Thank you for an excellent new way to fix pork tenderloin.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever! I spent a long time looking for a new recipe for pork tenderloin and chose this one. I love the flavors, how tender the meat is and how very simple the recipe is. I did double the sauce so I could have it to go with  the potatoes I served it with,following the suggestion made with the recipe. I have been cooking for over 60 years and try new recipes all the time. This one is special.

Great recipe.  It's quick, easy, and tasty.  The key is not to overcook the pork.  Also, I didn't have balsamic  vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  It was good!  If you like a lot of sauce, I would double the sauce part.

This was one of the best pork medallion recipes I have ever made. Simple but elegant, my family and friends were delighted with the meal. I served it with fried red potatoes and shallots along with fresh cucumber, tomatoes and basil salad all from our garden.

I kept all amounts called for the same except for the meat. I used one pound, not two. I think I would double the other ingredients if I had two pounds of pork. 

The dish was flavorful. The pork was nicely tender.

I left out the capers because my family doesn't like them, otherwise I made a directed. I like balsamic pork loin, but cutting them into medallions made the sauce overpowering. They were good, but I'll stick with my regular balsamic pork loin recipe.

I used a tenderloin which made very small pieces that I then pounded flat. If I make this again I will use loin pieces. The sauce was nothing special and certainly didn't look as appetizing as in some of these other pictures. Maybe I did something wrong.

Oh my word!  This dish is so good!  I followed the recipe except for the capers.  I didn't have any in the house, but I did have mushrooms.  I put them in at the same time the recipe called for the capers to be added.  This is one for the books and I'll definitely be putting it in my recipe rotation. It would be a really nice entree' for a dinner party.

I wasn't a fan but my husband and kids liked it. I'll still make it but probably use less vinegar as I thought the flavor was overwhelming. Otherwise it wasn't bad just not my favorite

Very good; I particularly liked the little zing of flavor.  My husband thought it was good, but wasn't wowed by it.  I didn't have garlic salt or lemon zest, so I used garlic powder, salt, and lemon pepper.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and thought it was easy to make and very flavorful.  I served it with rice.

8.20.17   I’ve made this delicious recipe a number of times with pork tenderloin, but last night, I used chicken tenderloins...turned out equally well!  The balsamic seems to mellow out a bit when simmered and renders a very nice sauce.  This is so easy to make and has lovely presentation.  Simple enough for a weeknight meal, but nice enough for company.

I followed the directions of one of the other reviewers and browned the medallions, then threw everything in the dutch oven and stuck it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.  It came out delicious!!  The sauce didn't thicken up, but we didn't mind - I probably would thicken it up with some cornstarch next time.

I always love the combination of lemon and capers, so I doubled the sauce. Yummy! Didn't have garlic salt, so I used Emeril's Essence. Used a Pork loin filet since that's what I had on hand. Did have to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Will try next time with Hormel's lemon garlic Pork loin filet. This is a keeper.

Wonderful!  Had to use balsalmic reduction, didn't have vinegar.  Just added more broth and less reduction than called for vinegar.  Will prepare again.  Easy, quick and delicious!

This one was a big hit at our house. It's definitely a keeper recipe. We've never had tenderloin so tender. Because of an individual in the household with a gluten intolerance we used gluten free flour. We also added more broth than the recipe suggested.

I have to agree with the others;  no changes needed.  This was so tender and tasteful.   The only thing I did that was not mentioned was to cut off the silver membrane on the tenderloin before cooking.   It can make a meat difficult to cut and curl up when cooking.  The flavors were great and the sauce was a delight.  We felt very special eating this  with mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots and plan to use this for "company" dinner.  Thank you for this recipe.

I hate to change the recipe however, I did add 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic bc  I didn't have any capers (realized too late) ..it was delicious ! The lemon zest was just enough as was the balsamic...sometimes I find balsamic overwhelming but with the lemon, chicken broth and garlic it was perfect ! Definitely making this again !

This was my first trying pork loin this way. My husband loved it. I followed one of the other reviews by adding a little corn starch to help the sauce thicken faster and pull all the flavored together.

This was really good, I'm glad I decided to take a chance my husband finished it off and that is a VERY good sign, I doubled the sauce & capers but didn't have lemon zest it was still good

A deceptively quick and easy recipe given the outstanding outcome. Followed the recipe to a T. Perfection. Served with a nice salad and a lemon ricotta round ravioli that got a Trader Joe's and dinner was out of this world. Will make again. I may throw in some green peppercorns into the sauce sometime just to see. But the recipe as it stands guarantees you a wonderful meal. Thank you, Marianne.

Amazing….i used a full pork tenderloin, sliced  1 1/2" and pounded gently.   I was nervous the lemon and capers would be overwhelming, but it is a perfect combination.   It came out so tender both times i have made it.  It is an instant favorite.

Didn't find this so appealing.  The pork was tender but didn't really like the sauce.  I would try something else before I tried this one again.

A simple, elegant and excellent dish!!  I used garlic powder, instead of garlic salt for the reduced sodium, and will double the broth, balsamic vinegar and capers next time, to give more sauce for drizzling on the side or rice and broccoli.

My family loved this dish. I did make two modifications. I added a tablespoon of Harissa spice to the flour mixture and about 1/4 cup of white wine with the balsamic vinegar and chicken stock. I'll be making it again. My husband and daughter told me so when they cleared their plates in record time.

Excellent flavour! Made as per recipe, except no lemon zest (didn't have a lemon) and I pounded the pork slices to about 1/2". WOW! Added a pinch of flour to help thicken the sauce. Okay, so maybe I didn't make it per recipe, but close! Served with some leftover risotto with peas and some steamed green beans! AWESOME!

Delicious! Made recipe as written except I had no lemon zest (used a splash of lemon juice instead) and it turned out great. So easy to make, and looks like a gourmet dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely the most delicious pork medallions I have ever had (let alone made).  I also suggest making extra sauce because it is so fabulous and everyone will want more of it.  Great recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This was delish! So easy too! My hubby raved about it and I am making it again tonight and serving over  buttered no yolk noodles. The only thing I did different was add 3 cups chicken stock  and 5 cloves garlic and thicken it a bit with cornstarch.

I had to double up the sauce as there wasn't much to use when it was ready. However, it came out pretty delicious. I hadn't tried anything like this so I was unsure of how it'd taste. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.

Beautiful enough for company.  Excellent quality of meat that can be cut to save what's too much for the present dining.  Fabulous sauce.   Definitely a keeper, going into the 'make it for guests' column.

I think it is great.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's fried, and frying is not healthy.  I'm going to make it again because it IS so good, but will attempt to make taste just as good by baking or grilling it part way and then putting in a pan with the sauce and a little arrowroot flour (for anyone gluten free) or something to thicken it a little.
I also think cut in cubes with the sauce on the side to dip in could also make a great appetizer.
Thanks!

Delicious!! The meat was so tender. My family absolutely loved it! I accidentally put in a cup of chicken broth instead of 1/2 cup, but it still tasted amazing! So easy to make that an accident prone 16 year old was able to pull it off with only minimal accidents!

This recipe is a keeper.  I followed it exactly.  It was so delicious.  I served it with mashed yukons and beluga lentils.  Great flavors and the pork was very moist.  Love that you did not have to add salt or lots of fat to this easy elegant and healthy dish.

When I put the pork on the plate it looked great but when I took a bite the first thing I noticed was a horrible slimy textured coating on the pork.  Then the flavour hit - the  sauce wasn't as bad as the texture but it certainly wasn't good, ("tastes like vinegar, in a bad way" was the feedback I got).  We managed to salvage some of the pork by scraping off all the sauce but it was definitely inedible as it was.

Thank you so much Marianne!  This was so good and yet simple to make.  Company worthy for sure.  I will be making this again, perhaps without capers as I am not all that fond of them.  I made extra sauce to go on rice and am glad I did.

This had such a great, strong flavor to it.  I did have issues with the sauce not thickening quickly enough, but I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe.  I guess we'll find out next time, because there will definitely be a next time!

It was delicious!!  My husband has had many pork tenderloin dishes over the years and he said, hands down, this was his favorite!!  I made it just as written, and the pork was fork tender, and the sauce was wonderful.  I did add onions to the pan - the only thing I changed.  Next time, I will make more sauce, because it was so yummy!!

I read the reviews. I made this according to the recipe but left out the lemon zest and capers, not on purpose.  It was still delicious. I will definitely make this again. This was easy, fast, and the sauce is great.  The whole family loved it, even the reluctant seven year old.

Wow! That was delicious. Thick cut boneless pork chops were on sale, so I bought two and cut them into generous chunks. I doubled the sauce & was very heavy handed with the capers since I know my family loves them. I was a bit concerned after pouring in the balsamic vinegar since the smell of it was enough to clear out the kitchen, but everyone returned as it cooked down. I didn't measure the lemon zest but I used a whole small lemon and the flavor seemed just right.  Served with a vegetarian dirty rice (leftover & reheated) and sliced, sautéed zucchini with onion. The whole meal took 28 minutes from entering the kitchen to sitting at the table. Thanks for sharing, this one went in the recipe box.

Excellent and can be used for company or just every day.  Love the fact that the medallions can be cooked just until tender and not overcooked like a lot of pork dishes.   Personally I can t eat any meats or poultry that is cooked even a little bit dry so this fits the bill.

We liked it.  I would try cutting up the loin in about 3oz pieces instead of bite size next time (which is what the picture shows).

I just have one thing to say about this... O M G!  This was a fabulously easy, fabulously tasty recipe!  We followed one reviewer's advice and added fresh garlic but other than that recreated it exactly per the instructions and it was wonderful!  Thanks so much! Served with fresh sauteed green beans with almonds and a Balsamic & Caper Potato Salad we found on canadianliving.com.

This recipe was phenomenal!!  I did add halved cherry tomatoes and mushrooms at the same time I added the capers and lemon zest.  The recipe is very quick and easy.  I doubled the sauce and served it over whole grain pasta.  Was delicious!!  Thank you so much for sharing.

This dish was very tasty, very moist and tender.  I left out the lemon - personal preference.  I served over rice.  The only issue I had was dealing with the boyfriend who hated the smell of the balsamic vinegar when it was cooking - he ate it though!

Other than pounding the pork and adding extra capers (LOVE THEM) and doubling the chicken broth to have more sauce for mashed potatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly! I never rate recipes, but this one deserves a 5+ star rating.

I squeezed the lemon juice into the dish, which I think made it too lemony.  I also cooked it for longer than recommended, so the sauce really thickened until there was no sauce left.  Next time I won't cook it so long and won't use the lemon juice, and maybe will add more balsalamic to it.

I made this with 9 pork chops so had to adjust the recipe. The flour coating was a bit frustrating because it didn't stick to the chops well. This was the first time I had capers. I thought they were tasty but my family not so much. Not sure if I used 1 tbsp of zest because I just zested one lemon and tossed it into the sauce. The flavor combos I got from the reduction was great. Next time I make this, I will omit the flour and just season the meat with the garlic salt and pepper and go from there.

This recipe is the fastest, easiest, tastiest main dish ever.  I made it as written, except doubled the sauce.  Would be great for guests.  Served with roasted brussels sprouts and twice baked potatoes in a bowl b/c the jackets broke. :-(

The recipe was incredibly delicious.  The sauce was really great and had a perfect balance of flavors for me.  As suggested by others, I did double the sauce and am glad I did because my boyfriend loved the sauce so much he put it on the green beans and the rice I had served with the dish.

We have some great grilling recipes for pork tenderloin, but were looking for something for stove-top prep in the winter.  This recipe is AMAZING----so delicious!  Fast, easy, elegant!  It made us so impressed with ourselves!  We served it with oven roasted tomatoes (also w/balsamic) & some roasted brussel sprouts--delicious.

This was okay.  Had no problems with the pork turning out mushy, the consistency worked well and the meat was moist.  The sauce didn't blend well/the meat didn't absorb it well.  It was just okay in flavor.  Will use my pork tenderloins for better recipes.

Wonderful, fast and easy! The only changes I made were to double the delicious sauce and flatten the medallions just a bit before I dredged and cooked them.  Be sure to use a good quality balsamic vinegar. Will definitely be making this again.

Dec 2011.  Easy to do.  Balsamic vinegar gives it a dark glaze, impressive, serve for guests.

At first I wasn't sure about making this dish, but boy am I glad I did.  Because it is just my husband and myself, I altered it for just 2 people.  Don't let the Balsamic vinegar stop you from trying this!  It is GREAT!

Really good but I had to add a bit of honey as it was too acidic and then a bit of lemon because it was too sweet!  Would definitely make again though and would possibly use chicken.

Wow!  Who knew that balsamic vinegar and chicken broth together would taste so good.  I doubled the sauce too.  My husband is raving--delish!  Thank you Marianne!  UPDATE:  The flavors were even better the next day!

This recipe was delicious! My mother could not stop talking about how tender the meat was. (I pounded the pork & added just a little more oil)I was so proud of it, that I sent some to my brother and his wife. They gave a sample to her sister. They wanted to know what it was. (I did not have enough lemon zest so I added some lime zest) Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I am not much of a cook but have made it a goal to try. This was SO easy and what made it SO delicious was just that the flavors from the seasonings were amazing. Thanks for makingthe first step towards my goal so easy!

I'm not that crazy about pork but got a good deal at the store for stir fry pork. I usually think it is much too dry. This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I did make one change. I go to street fairs and usually try different balsamic vinegars. I used my fig balsamic and it tasted fantastic. I have lots of different flavored balsamics so I will try another next time. I agree with others about adding more chicken broth. I didn't feel I had enough gravy to pour over the top. I also baked potatoes, which were perfect with the gravy. I used asparagas as recommended. Thanks much for the great recipe!

So simple and I had all the ingredients on hand!  After making it, my husband said, "You can make this anytime" - his highest compliment.  I zested an entire lemon for the recipe and kind of eyeballed the capers to be about double, and added them after reducing the sauce down to a thick syrup, so it was quite tart but delicious.  Have already made it twice and will be making it again!

Marianne, YOU ROCK!! This is Fabulous! I love the balsamic vinegar! I made this as written,(I know,I was shocked Too). I had some boneless pork shoulder ribs. I simmered them a couple hours and used polenta as the base for the pork. I fried it till crispy.The pork turned into carnitas and pulled it apart and stacked it on the polenta slices. I poured the sauce on top. This is Delicious:) Thank You Thank You Marianne!

This is sooo sooo yummy!! I made a double batch and am glad I did. If I didn't eat so much at dinner I would be eating another one right now. I cannot wait for the left overs. This will be a regular at our house and we don't have many of those as I always make something different. Thx for sharing withh us Marianne!!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  When even my picky husband likes it, you know it's a winner.  The only difference I did was to double all sauce ingredients BUT the vinegar.  I left that at 1/3 cup and for us it was perfect.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for a great recipe:)

This is a very good dish, but I believe it would be better by making the medallions thinner and at least doubling the sauce.  If you reduce the amount that's called for, there is very little left for on the pork, let alone for putting some over rice or a similar accompaniment.  I also needed additional time to cook the pork than stated.  Nevertheless, it's a good dish that's not very time consuming.

Really good, even without capers. I loved this and will make it again.
