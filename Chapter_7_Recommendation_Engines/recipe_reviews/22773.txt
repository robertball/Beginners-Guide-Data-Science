This is my "sure thing" salad for potlucks.  If I don't bring it, people are disappointed.  It is very "kid-friendly" but appeals to adults as well.

My recipe is slightly different but easy to remember.  I use one cup of boiling water, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon candies, 1 package of cherry Jello and 1 can (or the equivalent) of apple sauce.  It can be doubled, tripled,...you get the idea!  

When people ask for the recipe the 1:1:1:1 ratio is easy for them to remember.  Lately I've been making it with cinnamon oil, like the kind that flavors hard candy, and that's even easier.  It takes a few drops per cup of water.  Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe--made it for the family over the holidays twice! The second time the local stores were out of red hots so I had to use hard candy cinnamon discs-- they worked just as well! It surprised me but I was glad! Great recipe, thanks!

This is the jello salad my mother-in-law made for at least 40 years, and that I've been making for my husband every Christmas and Thanksgiving since I inherited his mom's binder of favorite recipes. He loves it (and the memories it brings) and now my grandchildren have fallen in love with it, too. It goes great with turkey!!

Simple, quick & very tasty--makes a great snack!  As suggested by  another reviewer--it reminds you of candy apples. And the applesauce gives it a pleasing texture too.

I can't tell you how thrilled I was to find this recipe.  I made this about 25 yrs. ago and lost the recipe when my storage unit was broken into and ALL of my wonderful recipe books were stolen.  This was and will continue to be a HUGE family favorite.

Could not be any easier. It was a huge hit. It is not, however, the most spectacular looking thing you could bring to an event. Just looks like a bowl of red jello.

I tasted this wonderful dish at a church potluck.  The red hot candies 
and applesauce are very tasty together, the jello gives it a bright 
cinnamon-red appearance.  The little boy next to me ate nothing but
a big bowl of this!  Great recipe.

I didn't like it at all. 
It tasted like a candle because of the red hots and applesauce mixed together. 
The texture was also quite weird.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. My bro-in-law had a suggestion of adding diced apple (maybe a granny smith -great idea for Christmas).  Easy to make, something different and yummy gets 5 stars from me every time.

This salad is tasty and so easy to make! I don't keep red hot cinnamon candies in the house, so I usually add a teaspoon of cinnamon instead. So easy and yummy!

Reading previous reviews, I see that people either loved this or hated it.  We were certainly in the former group.  A very pretty salad, good for a holiday table.  The consistency is different from most gelatin salads, but we liked it, and thought the cinnamon taste was perfect.  My only suggestion would be to dissolve the candies in boiling water in a mixing bowl, then add the applesauce.  Pour it into a mold or serving dish after the ingredients are well blended.

I think the flavor would have been very tasty, but the texture was so bad I couldn't get myself to eat it.  The color was great, and it looked very good though.

This was awful.  We did not like the consistancy.  It was in my opinion a waste of good applesauce and good jello. The cinnamon taste left us cold.  My husband hated it. It just did not work.

This was good, and very easy. I had never had anything like it before. I wanted to use Red Hots but couldn't find them ANYWHERE. So I used Hot Tamales, but they didn't fully dissolve and I was picking little clear tubes out of the bottom of the mixture (the coating dissolved but not the chewy inside) hoping to get them all! I think it would be better with Red Hots and will be trying again if I can ever find them.

I grew up eating this. A few of my daughters and my niece really love this recipe. It is a nice change from plain jello and the fluffy jello salads. I personally don't care for it much, though, but it is easy to make and different.

I loved this!  So easy and so good!  I ended up using one 3 oz. package of cherry jello and one of strawberry cause that's what I had on hand.  My two year old loved it as well. I'm looking forward to trying it with cool whip on top!

This was a truly unique and creative salad . I fell in love with this the moment I sampled it before dinner. I could find reg SF cherry jello so I had to settle for black cherry( I Was in a hurry to try it and patience is not my thang). Next time I will use cherry jello. The flavor is very addicting, you eat it and you just want to keep eating it. I served it on a bed of lettuce.Easy to make and pretty to look at. Thanks again for another keeper Miss Bee.

I love this salad.  My grandma has made this for many years and I misplaced the recipe.  I was, fortunately, able to find it here.  For those who haven't tried it, it sounds a little weird, but it is so good.  It's very refreshing and pretty and kids love it!  A definate 5 star.

My mother has made this recipe for years.  It's always been a favorite of mine, as well as my brother's and sister's.  I like to create some variety by adding a little more jell-o to help deepen the brilliant red color.  It's definetly unique!

This was awesome...I read the reviews and well I was skeptical but you know what I took the plunge and made it.  And I am glad I did. I didn't have 6oz packages of Cherry Jello so I used 4 - 4oz...I doubled the recipe, as I wanted to try and see the difference between the unsweetened and sweetened applesauce.... There was no difference that I could tell but thanks for the recipe it will be a staple in our house from now on...:)

It's hard to tell from the picture, but this sets up nice and is a great compliment to any meal!  I used strawberry and raspberry s/f jello because it's what I had on hand.  Also, I couldn't find the red hots, so I just used hard cinnamon candies.  I doubled it and served 10 people just fine.  My mother-in-law makes a similar salad, but I believe I will make this one from now on.  Thanks!

Way too much cinnamon/red hot taste--too sweet.  With just a little, tho, makes excellent congealed salad. Applesauce is good with most any kind of jello. I like to use a cup of Ginger Ale instead of water, and leave out the red hots. (Reckon that makes it a whole other recipe, tho.)

My sister made this and she added a topping of very fine minced celery, chopped pecans into mayo and whipped cream or kool whip...excellent blend and crunch.

This was excellent flavored, but too much water caused the jello to not set.  We at it like it was applesauce instead of jello.  I will make again but reduce water to 1 cup.

I have made this recipe in the past. The only thing that I would change is the amount of cinnamon. I double the amount  to give it more zip!

This is a tradition in our family.  As others have said, you either love it or hate it - there aren't too many people on the fence.  I love it, my husband hates it.  Yum!

Wonderful!  I had to leave the cinnamon out becuase my kids wouldn't like it and it still turned out really good.  I added a little bit more applesauce to make it a bit thicker (plus I didn't want to leave the little bit in the jar, it was homemade applesauce).  This is a quick dish to make when in a pinch.  Thanks for sharing!

HELP!!! I LOVE this receipe and so does my family. I made it for Thanksgiving but thank heaven's so did my sister. Mine did not set up at all. We d a straw. I figured I didn't follow directions no biggie. I've made it 2 more times and it just will not set up. We ate it anyway just had to eat it like soup! The flavor is awesome! What am I doing wrong???? I'm determined to figure it out.

Attractive when served with mint leaves but mediocre in taste according to my guests.  It does not have any real spice to it because the flavor is overpowered by whatever candy you use.  If you are going to make it, be certain you find the actual red hot candies- substitutes make it worse.

I have been making this for years. e1loves it. I use 1pkg of red jello 1 cup of hot water 1 can of wholeberry cranberry(this adds substance to the mixture) cinnamon to taste. put in container of choice and place in refridgerator until solid. can be made a few days ahead. be sure to put airtight cover on bowl. I am going to try the applesauce with the cranbery sounds awesome. Try this one of these salads at least once it will become a family favourite.

You won't believe how good this is.  I would make it the day before instead of day of since mine was a little loose.  The kids ate it with whipped cream during the week!  It was really good with the meat.

i thought it was delicious.  My family did not eat it because they are not a big fan of cinnamon.  I will not make it to eat at home.. but i may make it to take to a party.  it is different.  great for cinnamon lovers.
