This is my favorite dish.  I double the recipe plus I have added fresh mushrooms and green pepper with a little swiss cheese.  I have made this about 10 times and everytime it is better.  My best friend says this is her FAVORITE DISH.  Try it, you will love it.

I love this dish, but I have some changes that I make to my own that I think makes it taste better (depending on your taste buds).

I don't use the wine or dressing mix in mine and instead of the mushroom soup, I  use cream of chicken. I'm addicted to it!

I made a big oopsie and it still came out fabulous.  Made this for a sick friend, as I shy away from cream soup recipes but I want to make this again for my dinner.  Used GOLDEN CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup and halved the recipe for 1 person.  Used 3 chicken breasts based on reviews that there is alot of sauce.  Heated sauce ingredients on stove.  Replaced half the wine with chicken broth and realized afterwards that I did not use 1/3 but 2/3 cup.  I therefore decided to just cut the chicken breasts into pieces, browned them in the butter/dressing mixture,(Good Seasons Cheese Garlic), added the sauce and simmered on stovetop.  In lieu of the rice, I used eggnoodles and omitted the second tbsp. of dressing from the noodles.  This was ohhh sooo good!  The wine I used was not a dry one but a bit sweet so added about 1/4 cup sour cream to offset any sweetness.  Also added a tsp. of roasted chopped garlic to the sauce.  Really wonderful and quick easy recipe.

This dish was amazing! I changed it some, I don't really like mushrooms, I'm a picky eater. I cut this recipe in half, 2 chicken breasts, 1 package of cream cheese, arbor mist raspberry twist wine to taste, 1 can of cream of chicken, italian dressing to taste, white rice, and some pam. I browned the chicken after spraying the pan with just the italian dressing. I then put it in an 8x8 pan already sprayed and covered with a mixture of 1 package of cream cheese, arbor mist raspberry twist wine to taste, 1 can of cream of chicken, italian dressing to taste, and about 1/2 a cup of sour cream, and added some onion powder, garlic powder, and some basil seasoning. I baked the chicken at 350 degrees, for 40 minutes. Then I made the rice like it said with the remaining dressing, and cooked as the rice package said and added some more italian dressing to the rice after. We used the extra sauce from the chicken over the rice, and served with some green beans, (as picture shows). Hope you love this recipe as much as my fiance and I do!

Yummy!  I deglazed the pan with a little wine and then added the pan drippings to the soup/wine mixture.  It added a little color and a lot of flavor.  I also added fresh ground pepper, used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  The Italian dressing mix did not add a lot of flavor to the rice but it was pretty.  I also added some garlic herb dry dressing to the soup mixture.  What a great company dish!

I loved this recipe! I changed it just a bit by using 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 cup of nice chardonay. The wine really cut the richness of the soup and the cream cheese. Needs a dash of color but it has excellent flavor.

This recipe was suprisingly good and easy.  I was a little afraid it would taste to much like cream of mushroom soup but it all cooked together into a nice sauce.  I used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, and chicken broth.  The cream cheese seemed a little chunky so next time I think I might melt it in the microwave to make it smooth.  I would recommend this for the great taste and the little effort.

I used 6 chicken breasts w/ plenty of sauce to spare. Also, I added some fresh mushrooms in with the chicken while baking and used only 1/2c white wine. Although I didn't see any extra taste in the rice by using the remaining Italian seasonings packet - it looked pretty. Although it *looks* dull (being all white) - it was pretty tasty and overall we were pleased.  If I made this again, I might add some red bell peppers to the bake or steamed brocoli at the end to sprinkle overall for some color. Thanks Lori!

I halved this recipe and it still made more sauce than needed.  However, I love saucy concoctions, so it was fine with me!  I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken instead and it turned out fine.  I also used Tastefully Simple Herb and Spinach Dip Mix instead of the Italian dressing mix because that's what I had.  The chicken browned nicely in olive oil and the dip mix, and it could've been eaten on it's own without the sauce!  I liked this, but next time I would add more seasoning to the sauce, like garlic or maybe even red pepper.  I like everything a little spicy.  Overall, it was good and I would make it again.

Really good.  Maybe a little less wine and a little more italian dressing seasoning.

this was an awesome recipe.  Instead of having the rice on the side though i cooked it up and put it on the bottom of the pan kind of like a caserole.  Everyone enjoyed it though.

This one's a keeper!  My toddler even liked it!  The only problem I noticed was the 4.7 ounce package of italian-style dressing mix should actually be about .4 ounces.  You really only need about 2 tablespoons.  This was very tasty and filling.

This recipe may contain an error as I used the 28 oz. rice called for and it was TOO much rice.  Perhaps 16 oz. would be better??

Soooo Good! This recipe quickly became a favorite in my house, we make it on a regular basis. I find myself craving it all the time. I usually cut the chicken in strips and then shred it after I cook it, and mix the rice in so it's kinda like a casserole. You're gonna love it!

This was pretty good. My boyfriend swore it was one of the best things he had ever eaten, but I was not quite so impressed. The sauce was too rich for me, I think too much cream cheese. I did make some changes to it. I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup, I did not use the Italian seasoning because i didnt have it, instead I just used salt and pepper and a good amount of thyme. I also put green onions in the sauce and used as a garnish. I loved my changes, i guess it just depends on your tastes!

The sauce was really rich but really good. We put it over pasta instead of rice and cut the chicken into chunks rather than leave it whole. The whole thing was so simple that we will probably make it again!

My very picky husband LOVED this recipe!  I added some red bell pepper strips and I used chicken tenderloin strips instead of whole chicken breasts.  I also used the reduced fat versions of the soup, and will probably try reduced-fat cream cheese next time as well.  I served it with steamed broccoli and carrots.  Very yummy recipe that was easy to make.  The wine was a very nice touch to this recipe as well.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good.  Tasted like the Doris Chicken my mom would always make.  I only had a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese so I also added some cream and some parm cheese to make up the difference.  Fabulous!

This was OK. I made half of the sauce and it was plenty for 3 chicken breast halves. But this wasn't the best chicken in creamy wine sauce that I have had. Probably won't make again.

Neither my husband nor I enjoyed this. The sauce was just too rich for us, I think maybe if I used lighter versions of ingredients for the sauce it would be better, as well as use less cream cheese. I just didn't like the flavor that was produced from the cream cheese, mushroom soup and wine mixture.

Wow!  I was surprised how great this tastes since it is such an easy recipe.  This is the recipe I always make now when I am bringing dinners to friends who have just had a baby and it is always a huge hit!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes. It's all about the sauce - I sometimes will use 3 cans of mushroom soup instead of two and I also use more white wine than it calls for. The biggest change I make is I use a -sparkling white wine- (off-dry to sweet - asti to extra-dry champagne, prosecco, etc) rather than just any old white. This adds some sweetness to the sauce and it really changes the flavors and makes it absolutely addictive. The good news is, the wine doesn't have to be expensive. I find that a mini 187ml size bottle is the perfect size.

My husband is more picky than a two year old...he doesn't like mushrooms, so I used cream of chicken. The chicken was excellent! The rice was good, but I think it needed more umph.

My husband loved it. It was very creamy. I used parsley at the end to add some color.

My boyfriend doesn't like chicken, but he loved this dish.  I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and I also used garlic butter rice.  I thought the sauce was a bit lumpy, so I put it in the blender.  It came out smooth and creamy.  This has become a regular dish around my house.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I only had one can of cream of celery soup so I just used that and there was plenty of sauce for three chicken breast.  I also only browned the chicken in 1T butter and 1T Italian dressing. I will make this recipe again!!

Pretty good, pretty simple....not bad for something quick....I wouldn't make it for a "guest to impress" but it is a nice, one pan, quick home meal.

My husband liked this dish. I thought the sauce was too heavy (even with low fat cream cheese and soup.)

Last night I made this for the first time and was extremely pleased.  My husband loved it, too.  I used 6 chicken breasts and there was plenty of extra sauce.  I made it with a white and wild rice mix and steamed broccoli.  We each had plenty for our lunches today, too.  My best friend and I share recipes all the time, so I can't wait to share it with her.  
Thanks, Lori!

To make this a little more tasty, I would wrap each chicken breast in a stip of bacon before putting into the oven.  It's really wonderful.

We thought this recipe was great! My husband is a very picky eater, so I'm just thrilled!  I did add red pepper and some fresh mushrooms to the sauce, and my only mistake was to use regular chicken breasts which I de-boned after browning.  They ended up a bit too tough! My DH also loved the chicken flavored rice! I may also use low sodium soup next time.  Thanks!

I took some hints from the others and added strips of red bell pepper on top when baking.  Then sauteed some mushrooms in butter, garlic and white wine separately and put on top the chicken before serving.  Also cooked rice in chicken broth plus the italian mix.  Turned out awesome!
