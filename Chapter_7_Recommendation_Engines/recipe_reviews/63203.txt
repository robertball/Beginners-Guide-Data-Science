This recipe was wonderful! The ingredients were pretty basic which made it all the more simple to whip up.The recipe was well written and very specific. Our family loved the unique and tangy blend of different spices. The peach slaw was out of this world. The presentation was really nice. There were no leftovers and the family wanted to know when we could fix it again. I really urge everyone to give this a try. I think you'll really enjoy!  Hats off to Chef Eddie Matney. Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor combination.  The peach slaw definitely complemented the delicious ham.  I served with boiled new potatoes, and the meal was a complete success!!

The peach slaw is amazing! I usually use nectarines for their firmer texture and slice very, very thinly.  I omit the red bell pepper, and substitute fresh basil if I don't have mint. 

For the kebabs, I mix the seasoning with olive oil to make a paste, then skewer fresh pineapple, red onion, red and yellow bell pepper, and squash or zucchini along with the ham, dab the spice paste over everything and cover and refrigerate an hour or so. Alternately, the kebab ingredients can all be thrown in a bag with the oil and spice mixture and marinated, then cooked in a grill basket (or roasted in a hot oven when it's too cold for grilling).  Coarsely chop up any leftover pieces and make quesadillas the next day with canned pinto beans and asadero or jack cheese.

Very nice seasoning on the ham; even my five-year-old loved it.  I was short on peaches but nectarines made a nice substitution.
