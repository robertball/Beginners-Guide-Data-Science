I have been wanting to make this recipe for a long, long time. Today the weather was cool, I had left over roast beef and gravy and I finally got to make it!  We loved it.  I did not drain my beef well of the gravy because we LOVE gravy, and I also didn't measure the horseradish, so I think I ended up using less(I will use more next time).  I made some without any horseradish for the kids and they loved it too!  This will get made after every roast dinner I make from now on!

Made these for lunch, and they were tasty. I made my own gravy(beef/mushroom), since that's what the submitter orginally intended, but it was removed from the final posting, and I used cojack on top...very good. If I served them for dinner, I'd prolly just add a simple salad, as they are quite rich and filling.

Now, I did change this recipe a bit but I give it 5 stars because the basics work and I was very skeptical of roast beef in shells but it was so delicious. It reminded me of poutine. I used the left over beef from pepperoncini beef on this site. I pan fried some onions and garlic, added the shredded beef to heat through - added shredded cheese and garlic cream cheese to make it creamy and stuffed the shells - covered with gravy and cheese (no horseradish, but the beef was already spicy). If your shells get tough - I covered mine for 15 minutes, cooked uncovered for 8 and 2 minutes on broil. The bf ate seconds and was asking for 3rds! If you like poutine this is sooo similar in flavours. Loved it.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for over a year and finally made it for dinner tonight. Yes, I did my own thing with it, but not too drastically different from the original recipe. I only wanted to make 1/2 a recipe because I used leftover roast that I had slow cooked with onion soup mix. I chopped that up and mixed it with the leftover gravy I had on hand. Being a little leary of it being too hot for the kids, I only used a big squirt of horseradish which I actually mixed in with the meat/gravy mixture. I stuffed my shells with this mixture. Poured some jarred gravy over top and then topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I actually did not have enough meat mixture to use up all of the 1/2 box of shells that I had boiled, I had about 5 leftover. I finished them up in the oven as directed. These were good, but need something else to add some flavor...maybe some sauteed onions and garlic and some other herbs. It was a great use for leftover roast beef and gravy though! Thanks CNM for the recipe!

you can also use homemade gravy if you prefer. also if you dont like horseradish you can omit it or use less according to your taste. i personally dont like horseradish but my wife does so i put it on hers but not mine.

These were a nice change from the usual dinner.  I skipped the horseradish for personal preference.  I did find it to be pretty salty - probably from the deli meat and jarred gravy combo.  My fiance does want to try it again with other combinations of meats and gravies.

Surprisingly good. I cut this down to one 7 oz. pkg. of roast beef (which is all I had) and it filled 12 jumbo shells. I used 2 pkgs. of brown gravy mix and made them according to directions. I made homemade horseradish sauce (AR recipe) and was really sparing on it since I wasn't sure we would even like this dish with it. I'm glad I used it, it really enhanced the dish and this would have been rather boring without it, but the amount called for is way too much for us. My husband said I could serve this one again. This wasn't fancy or really all that impressive, but it was different and good on it's own.

04-10-2012 UPDATE: This has turned out to be one of my hubby's favorite and most requested dishes. He'd rate this a 5. I have enjoyed it as well, but it still isn't one of my favorites.

Very good stuffed shells. I used "Simple Beef Flavored Gravy" for the gravy. Rather than topping with horseradish sauce, I put a big glob of it with the gravy and mixed it all together because I feared kidlets would get a big bite of horseradish.

This was just ok. 2 out of 4 people liked it in my house.  I followed the recipe exactly (save for making my own gravy).  I kind of want to make it again but I have to think about how to make it better.  I definitely won't add the cheese if I do (totally unnecessary).

Sorry... this was bland. Now, in the recipe's defense, I thought it sounded odd to use deli roast beef, so I actually put a roast in the crock pot with the gravy and let that sit all day, and then shredded the beef and used THAT kind of beef to fill the shells. I did use the horseradish, more gravy, and shredded cheese just like the recipe called for, but honestly, the overall effect was just bland to me. Even with the "kick" of the horseradish, the meal was flavorless. No one in my family liked it -- they just tolerated it, and then politely asked me not to make it again. Won't be trying this one again -- too much work for too little reward. Oh well!

These were just ok.. I used gouda cheese. I brought some over to my mother in law and she ended up taking them out of the shells. she said she couldn't get past the roast beef in the pasta shells. seeing as how i pretty much only cook for my family and not myself, i don't know if i will be making this again.

My husband wanted to give this 3 stars because he liked it but thought the pasta shell was a bit off...but he's not really a big pasta eater so I'm bumping it to four stars!!  It was really good. I basically followed the recipe as written except I only used one jar of gravy...four seemed like a bit much.  I just warmed the pound of beef in one jar of gravy...didn't add an extra on top and we enjoyed it. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were fantastic.  They make a ton, so make sure you have a lot of company.  Between 4 of us, we consumed maybe a third of what this made.  I froze some so I'll update later about how well they did frozen.  I made a few as written (which were delicious) and then made a few variations.  Honestly everything was tasty: I couldn't mess these up!  For some of them I added sauteed shallots and mushrooms and on others I used gorgonzola instead of cheddar.  Didn’t matter what I did, still came out great!  This one’s a keeper!

I really liked that this recipe was different than most stuffed shell recipes that you see. I made this for dinner last night and it was well liked by most of the family. I do have two picky eaters who don't like roast beef so we will just ignore their opinions:). I only put horseradish on part of them because the kids don't care for it. My husband said he liked them with or without. I do like horseradish, but I actually prefered them without it. It somehow didn't work for me with the gravy. Also next time I think I will make my own gravy. It was a little to salty for me with the delli roast beef and pre-made gravy. Overall this was a great recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I only switched this up because my hubby does not like roast beef. (weirdo!!)I used thinly sliced smoked venison to make this. I have some pastrami that I am going to use to make it again for company this week-end. Very yummy and a nice change for stuffed shells!  Another good one from this cook.

These were definately different than anything I've ever had before. Hubby really liked them! I only used a few squirts of the horseradish sauce & just put it right into the meat & gravy mixture. Thanks!

WOWZA!  I made these last night and they were delish!  Per another reviewer I used tongs to fill the shells.  I followed the directions except I cut the roast beef up before heating, and i used a ton of cheese since we love cheese.  Next time I will try adding the Horseradish to the gravy mixture instead of topping the shells.  We found that it had a bit too much kick.  I will make this dish again!

Used Ground extra lean ground beef, gravy, shells and cheese and it turned out way better than expected! Not too salty - amazing comfort food.

These were good, something different, I think the pasta should be buttered before filling, and I only needed about a pound of roast beef, the negatives are they are not easy to fill, they are very messy and the gravy mix just keeps pouring out of the shells unless you position them just right, i love horseradish but definitely not with gravy it made them have an odd taste!...i did like these i used mozzarella instead of cheddar, next time absolutely no horseradish sauce!

This was great! Kind of time consuming to fill all the shells, so I did all the prep work one night and baked the next (did have to bake longer, because it had been refrigerated). I diced up my roast beef to make it easier to stuff. Only used one pan and stacked the shells on top of one another. There was just enough room for them all to fit. Very good recipe!

I don't think I've had so much fun making a dish before. I loved using my hands to stuff the shells full of the roast beef and everything. I felt like a kid again. Plus, my family said it tasted great. It did take them awhile to figure out the mystery ingredient, horseradish sauce. LOL. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar but next time I'll use a mixture of both.

This is delicious... granted, I did change the recipe a bit.  I chopped up roast beef and filled the shells with swiss cheese, sharp cheddar cheese and the roast beef.  I made a homemade mushroom gravy and poured it over everything, then covered with more swiss and cheddar cheeses and baked until nice and melted.  Yum.

Wow! I have been wanting to try these forever - but I just wasn't sure - the combo just didn't want to work in my head. Well, I made it last night and I am kicking myself for not doing them earlier. I did scale it down for 2 people. I used a roast beef I had made on the weekend, the gravy was from that as well. I had some frozen pre-cooked shells from another recipe and this made the dish ready to bake in under 10 minutes. I will definitely make this again and again. It was delicous - the combination of the horseradish and the gravy was so good! I couldn't realy taste the cheese and I am not sure if it is needed so when I do make it again I might leave it out. Thanks CNM!

I used leftovers for this. With my beef, I sliced it and added chopped onion to it. When the onion was soft, I put my gravy in with the beef. I'm new to horseradish, so I used two heaping TBSP. in the gravy. I used tongs to get my beef out to put in the shells. I added a gravy packet, because I didn't have enough gravy, and just used a cheese blend I had. This is so good. I'll make this again.

These were really east to make. I used two cans of beef gravy and added one packet dry beef gravy powder along with the 1 cup of water the packet called for. I made a few without the horseradish sauce for my daughter but after she tried a piece of mine w/ the sauce, she said "next time I want that sauce on mine". I Will definitely make these again!

This was good!  DH and I think we would prefer mozzarella or provolone instead of the cheddar so we'll try that next time.

I thought this recipe had a great flavor!  The reason I am giving it four stars is because the shells came out of the over a little hard around the edges.  I don't know if I did something wrong, or if it is suppose to be like this, but the shell in general was chewy and not cooked very well.  I followed the recipe and boiled the shells 10 minutes and then put them on wax paper to cool and stuffed them with the gravy/meat.  Maybe it was my fault but the flavor made up for the shells being a bit tough!  I would recommend this recipe, but next time I'll try to prevent the shells from hardening in the oven.  Any ideas?

This tasted like I was eating horseradish straight out of the jar!  I was heartbroken because I made the gravy, spent time stuffing carefully, etc., and it was totally inedible.  Literally.  It is the first time in my life I have actually been unable to eat something I prepared.

VERY good.  I did not add the horseradish to all of the shells because of small children eating.   I wish I would have as it really complimented the shells well.  It was a great and different way to use up leftover roast beef.  Thanks CNM for sharing!!

This gets five stars for its versatility. I used left over roast beef and it's gravy for the base. There wasn't enough meat so I fleshed it out with sautéed chopped onions. To enhance the gravy, I added a teaspoon of miso paste, more garlic, water, and beef bullion. I squirted each filled shell with a little wasabi horseradish, covered with cheese, then baked for 20 minutes covered with aluminum. While that was cooking, I chopped up a couple of handfuls of spinach with a half tomato, drizzled with olive oil and lime juice and mixed in about 1/4 cup feta cheese. When the shells came out of the oven, I uncovered them and spread the spinach mixture over the top and popped them back in the oven until the spinach wilted. This added contrast to the dish and relieved its blandness. My hubby loved it and said it's good enough for company. Yum!

I really enjoyed this recipe but did slightly alter it.  My grocer's deli roast beef was $10 per pound so I decided to use ground beef instead.  I also used 2 packets of the lower sodium gravy mix.  I browned the ground beef with seasonings and onion, added the prepared gravy and filled the cooked shells before topping with cheese and baking.  This was delicious and my kids and I gobbled it up!  I added a vegetable side dish to this for some nutritional value, but it wouldn't be difficult to hide diced carrots and other vegetables in the ground beef mixture!

Hubby wasn't a big fan of this dish. I liked it well enough, but it does seem very heavy, and it makes a ton! I did like the kick that the horseradish added to it.

These were very good.  I had some roast beef left over and homemade gravy so that is what I used in mine.  I also made half with horseradish and the other half without for the kids.  This was wonderful and I will make this again.

I thought this recipe was bizarre - pasta, roast beef, gravy, CHEDDAR cheese and horseradish?!  But I finally made it on the recommendation of others and found it to be surprisingly good!  DH absolutely LOVED it.  Only changes I made were to cut it down to about 2/3 of the recipe (only two of us eating) and I didn't measure the horseradish, but I think I decreased the amount ... just put about an inch and a half of the stuff in the squeezable container.  If I were to rate the recipe down at all, it would only be in the prep time ... draining the gravy off the meat and stuffing it into the shells was a major pita and the prep time for this was far longer than 30 minutes.  But then, I'm pretty slow, too.  But tips on stuffing shells would be welcome!

These were pretty good. I used leftover roast beef and gravy, and used old white cheddar cheese. I had the horseradish sauce on the side because I was not sure if I would like it - it was okay, but I prefer it without. A nice way to use up leftover roast beef.

Very good, and a different use of roast beef and shells.  Would probably be good with leftover roast beef and gravy as well.

These were awesome!  The only thing that I did not do was used less gravy, but that is only because I am not a huge gravy eater.  Loved how easy they were.  Next time I am thinking about adding a little bacon to the mix, but these are great "as is".
