My step son begs for hamburger helper and we don't buy a lot of processed food.... So I made this with whole wheat noodles and "homemade velveeta" ( 8 oz American cheese, 4 oz cheddar and 1 1/2 cups milk), and he LOVED it!   We had leftovers and ate it the next day, and it tasted even better!

If you haven't had Velvetta in 20 years - skip this recipe - you won't enjoy being reintroduced.  I was looking for an easy comfort food dish, and saw the 5 stars so I thought I would try this.  I always make something exact to the recipe the first time and then on the second add my own spin.  Not using Velveeta and making my own cheese sauce might make it better.

I gave it 5 stars only because its very good for what it is.. a mac n cheese dish.  It is quick, easy and inexpensive and the kids love it.  If judged against all foods I'd give it a 3.  Only change to the recipe was that I only had 1 and 1/2 cups of macaroni so I reduced the water to 1 and 1/2 cups as well.  Came out great.  Loved the one pot deal.  My grandson loved it.  All was well with the world.

i was looking for a homemade hamburger helper and came across this recipe.  i used it as a start because i did make some changes but my family loved it.  I used 1 lb of ground organic turkey, 2 tsp of both garlic and onion powder, one qtr onion, 1cup milk and 1cup water and about 2.5 cups rotini since i did not have elbows.  i also omitted sour cream since i did not have.  i used mozzarella but not a full 8 oz. it was really good and a great alternate to the box. will def make again and would prob add a veggi like broccoli.

This recipe has great potential but needs just a few minor changes.  I used V8 juice for most of the water (2 small cans plus the water to make 2 cups).  I did not use 8 ounces of cheese - I think that would be way overkill.  I probably used about 4 ounces.  I don't know that the sour cream added anything.  I added a few red pepper flakes to my own portion to add some slight heat.  Overall this is satisfying comfort food and can be changed to personal preferences.  Thanks!

I'd rather dirty a skillet and my pasta pot and get it in half the time.  Cook your pasta while you are browning your meat and seasonings.  Drain the cooked pasta  then add it to the meat mixture. I'm not a fan of Velveeta, so I used Asadero and cheddar (about half/half in portion).  I did not add minced onion, I used french onion dip instead of sour cream at the end.  Easy and quick.

I made this but used a couple of substitutes I saw in the reviews.  I made my own cheese sauce (milk and shredded cheese) and used tomato juice in replacement of some of the water. And I added a can chopped tomatoes and chilies.  This was a huge success!!!

Higher mark for quickness and ease. I upped the flavor by using tomato sauce in place of water and a mixture of cheeses, mosteralla, cheddar and pepper jack. Also wheat elbow macaroni. Could still taste better.

We loved this. To make it not so dry I added 1/4 cup milk. I also topped it with sliced American cheese and stuck it in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes  to brown. GREAT!

I made it with a few adjustments. I used 1 cup water and 1 cup milk as another reviewer suggested, added a little bit of cheddar cheese, used less onion and seasoned the finished product with more salt as it was a little bland. Turned out delicious, my boyfriend loved it!

I used shredded cheddar and a 1/2 cup onions. I would not drain corn next time to have more liquid. Had plenty of leftovers after feeding 3 . A great all round meal.

I had to substitute some ingredients. I used ground turkey instead of hamburger. I didn't have onion powder so I added onion soup mix. I  made a separate basic cheese sauce because I didn't have Velveeta cheese.  I served a side of mixed vegetables with this.  It's a pretty high-calorie dinner, sort of a comfort food dinner.  Everyone liked it.  I'll make it again but not too often.

It was easy and very filling. The seasoning, is a little light....not a broad range of flavors.....but if you need a good hearty meal in a hurry this will do.

I added a 1/4 chopped green pepper and 1/2 cup extra sharp cheddar... I also used a shredded cheddar blend to avoid the processed cheese food (Velveeta). I doubled the recipe and found it more reasonable.

Made this for my boyfriend and his dad; his dad doesn't eat a lot so made me feel good that he went back for seconds. Fast and easy to make.  Of course, all though I used all the ingredients, I didn't quite measure anything and ended up with a huge pan on of it. It didn't  go to waste.

It was good! I doubled the recipe, subbed 1/2 the water with milk, used a block of cheddar shredded, and added a dash of lawrys. I think I may prefer no sour cream and a bit more cheese if I made it again. I loved how easy this was!

Used 8oz of shredded cheddar and 1 cup of milk. Turned out good! If you want a cheesier dish add another cup or so of cheese.

I think maybe using a little milk or less of the velvetta would help.  Maybe I just made it wrong but it was SUPER thick.  It tasted okay but I could literally feel my arteries clogging!  Might make it again but definitely going to have to tweak it a little.

This is the best hamburger mac recipe I have found so far! I reduced the velveeta to 6 oz, added some milk (about 1/4 cup) and cheddar cheese (1 handful), and I added a dash of paprika and a dash of oregano. My picky son (and pickier husband) loved it!

I used vegetarian grounds instead of beef and also 12oz normal cheese plus 1-1/2 cup milk instead of velveeta (as another review suggested). I also added in broccoli before the noodles were done. Very good recipe to go off of.

It turned out surprisingly good but could definitely use some more spice or pizzazz. Maybe some vegetebles added would do the trick. I'd say it's good for children or picky eaters.

I added less macaroni than it required. My family loves their meat and they felt it was hidden by all the macaroni other than that, this was a family hit! I make it once a week.

Made it,  but with ground turkey and used real cheese shreds instead of processed. Worked out great! I added a little milk to keep it creamy and used real garlic and onion with the powders too.  Kid likes it, husband likes it. Win!

Was very good and super easy!! The only thing I changed was I used 4 ounces of Velveeta and 4 ounces of cheddar cheese instead of all Velveeta.

I used cheddar cheese and mozzarella and made a white sauce first. My son is an adult but he is still a picky eater complains about too much.   He asked for mac and cheese with hamburger.  He likes the box stuff  I don't.  Made this almost the same except added cheese in white sauce mixture.  This was so creamy and delicious even my son didn't complain.  Asked me to save this recipe so I could make it again.  Doubling this recipe was easy and still came out the same.

It was delicious but I made several changes. I don’t use velveeta. I made a cheese sauce from 1 cup cheddar cheese, some Cojack and whipping cream.

Look, this is a solid recipe for sure. My only issue is that using the box is cheaper, easier, and tastes nearly the exact same. This recipe is a little more natural - but you are still using that processed cheese, which reduces the value of a 'homeade' recipe further. Good recipe, but the boxed kits are easier and you get basically the same thing.

Easy dinner that comes together quickly.  Simple comfort food!  I use a whole pound of ground beef, gluten free macaroni, and grate a block of extra sharp cheddar (instead of the processed cheese).   I also add the optional cumin and chili powder as noted in the recipe.  My teenagers love it.

I like this recipe because it's versatile and hard to break.  I made a lot of changes to fit what I like and what I had on hand.  I used a pound of ground beef to start.  I ended up with about 1 1/2 cups of minced sweet onion so threw it all in.  I like the idea of cooking the macaroni with the sauteed onion and ground beef and seasonings because the pasta absorbs more flavor that way.  I used 2 teas. dry chicken bouillon, a generous few shakes of garlic salt, McCormick Steak seasoning which has various herbs, salt and pepper.  When the pasta was cooked I threw in a handful of chopped fresh parsley and 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I don't ever have Velveeta on hand.  I forgot the sour cream and it turned out wonderful anyway.  I will make again soon!

This was good, but consistency was sticky.  I forgot to add the sour cream at the end which may have helped some.  Won't be making very often--it's not a very healthy choice.

I used brown rice gluten-free macaroni and threw in a can of Rotel. My onion was not small so I omitted the onion powder.  It seemed like it needed more cheese so I added a handful of Mexican-blend shredded cheese at the end.  This was very good, but even better the next day.  I will have to double the recipe next time!

My son doesn't like to eat meat.  He's a carb lover, he eats the bread off his hamburger and walks away from the meat.  This is a great way to sneak some lean protein into his diet.  And he Loves It!!  I swapped ground turkey for beef and organic vegetable radiatore (Trader Joe's) for the pasta. It came out pretty thick, I think I'll thin it out with some milk next time.   
I must admit, I really like it too...

This is good comfort food, that I make about twice a year.  I use gluten free macaroni, and this time I used a couple tablespoons of dried onion flakes in place of chopped onion.  Otherwise I make exactly as directed.  My only advice when using gluten free pasta, is to only cook the pasta for 8 minutes total.

Very good but I I'd prefer just a little less macaroni, maybe one and a half cups instead of two.

I would increase the water a little more next time. Noodles were still a little crunchy and ran out of water to cook in so started to brown on the bottom of the pan. 
I also added 1/3 cup cheddar cheese at the end before sour cream to make it a little cheesier. 
It was good and I would make it again. My toddlers both loved it!

it was easy and budget friendly and not all that time consuming. I think if I ever made it again I would dial back on the onion,and i think i would also use another cheese with the velveeta.  Plus i added milk because it was super thick and very difficult to stir

This is way better than the boxed helper meals. Homemade flavor, quick preparation and great served with green beans.

I substituted Johnsonville Italian sausage for the ground beef and loved it!  I used regular Velveeta and sour cream, not low fat. I will definitely make again!

I really wanted to like this. Based on the review of cstock26, I reduced the Velveeta by 2 ounces and mine was still really thick. Admittedly, this was my first time cooking with Velveeta. I think the dish tasted like overly processed noodles rather than a dish with multiple layers of flavors. If you aren't used to eating many processed foods, follow this recipe to step 2 and then add a homemade cheese sauce.

My husband and I fixed this dish and added black garlic to it and that made it so awesome.  We also didn't hold back on the cheese or sour cream - very yummy dinner!

This is good, nice and creamy and cheesy.  It is a great recipe, and if you like basic mac and cheese, try this.
