This was pretty good. I made it with frozen blueberries, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. After about two hours in the fridge, it hadn't gelled much, but it was slightly more gelled the day after--maybe add more cornstarch? And the lemon zest was a nice touch but I think it would have been better with more of it. I agree that traditional blueberry pie is pretty boring, so this one is going in the right direction.

The combination of fresh, uncooked berries on the bottom covered by the fresh blueberry sauce poured over the top makes the blueberry flavor pop!  Delicious!

I made this recipe again last night and it was a huge hit. One review said they made it with frozen blueberries- the whole point of this recipe is to use fresh blueberries so you get that fabulous texture and taste of the fresh fruit. I'm not surprised that it didn't gel using frozen berries. While cooking the fresh berries, make sure that the compote thickens before pouring over the fresh berries. If it hasn't, add a touch more corn starch / cold water mixture.
