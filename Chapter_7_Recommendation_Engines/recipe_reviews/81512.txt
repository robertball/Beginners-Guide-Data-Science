11.10.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/81512/feta-shrimp-soup/ ... This almost seems like a restaurant-quality style soup.  I subbed a pound can of diced tomatoes (undrained) for the fresh tomatoes.  I didn't blend it either.  It was fine.  This is a soup you have to finish the day it's made or the shrimp will become tough with reheating - no matter how gently you do it.  I used reduced fat feta & added it to individual bowls instead of the pot.  It sank right away.  Some garlic croutons, or even toasted garlic bread would be a good suggestion for each bowl.  Then, when you add the feta it has a "raft" & can be better distributed with each spoonful instead of the last one. Note4Me:  After making. Try with asiago topped garlic bread in each bowl.  Sub Chicken for clam broth.

I followed this recipe to the "T" 100%... and it was sensational!  The fresh parsley in the end gave it that fresh tasting *pop* that only fresh parsley can give!  It put it over the top for us!  It was like something you'd taste in a 5 star restaurant!  LOVE THIS! ***NOTE - I am going to try making the soup the night before I need it BUT will NOT ADD the shrimp until I serve the soup the next day.  I'll simmer it 3 min to reheat/and cook the shrimp.  I think this will work.  ***NEW NOTE*** I have since made this using chicken broth as a substitute for the clam juice and I could not tell any difference in the delicious flavor.  Chicken broth is much more economical then using the clam juice.

Yummy.  I used diced canned tomatoes in place of the fresh and then used seeded and diced roma tomatoes and parsley for the garnish.  Served with fresh rolls, we really enjoyed this.

Fantastic soup! My guests raved about this soup and asked for the recipe.  I omitted the cheese, but served the soup topped with a crouton made of a slice of asiago cheese bread topped with fresh garlic, parmesan cheese and butter for a more elegant presentation.

Thanks for the recipe!  I made it just as written except that I left out the butter and oil.  It had a lot of flavor and didn't need any salt or other taste enhancers added to it.  A very good low-sodium dish that I will make again.

Very good! I did make two small changes.  Used canned tomatoes that I cut up quickly and used broth in place of clam juice (didnt have any).  It was great!  I will be making this again, topped with croutons too!

When making this, I admittedly cheated and used canned plum tomatoes, however, it probably didn't taste much different. This really was quite good, if not a little bit fishy. The amount of clam juice was a bit too much for me, but otherwise, the shrimp and feta complimented each other nicely. Thanks for sharing, Catherine.

This is so good! We used cooking sherry instead of the dry white wine and fat free feta cheese. It came out great. Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight and hubby and I ate the whole pot!!

Followed some other reviewer and used chicken stock instead of clam juice, and canned of chopped tomatoes (mostly drained).   I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of old bay seasoning.  It was HEAVENLY!!  We will definitely be making this one again and again!

This was good and not nearly as rich as I thought it would be. I used herbed feta, and basil instead of parsley. I think it could use another clove of garlic, and maybe a garnish of black olives.

Made this exactly as written, except I forgot to add in the parsley in the end.  BUt it is one of my favorite soups now.  I don't think my kids would like it, but us grown-ups sure did.  My Feta was mixed through out the soup and didn't sink.  Will make again.

This was good. My hubby dumped to much feta in, so a little overpowering, but not the recipes fault. I served with cheddar bay biscuits. My hubby still thought it should just be a first course. I thought it was perfect.

I was in the mood for a bisque, and tried this.  This soup is not brothy, so it was a good choice.  I am a novice cook, and my husband really liked this.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I used my immersion blender to save myself the trouble of tranferring the soup to the blender.  It worked fine and earned rave reviews from my husband.  I used precooked and shelled shrimp.

Um...this was OK. I like the feta idea, but it was a little gritty in the soup. I may try this one again minus the feta and add some basil to the puree.

Quite good.  My husband and I ate the whole pot with a loaf of garlic bread.  Used sherry instead of wine and canned tomatoes instead of fresh but still delicious!

I have been making this type of soup for years.  I modify it by adding crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I like a creamy soup, therefore I added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream.

The only change I made was to not do a complete puree...just personal preference. I like a little body to my soups. I also agree that you could easily change the clam juice for chicken broth or stock.

The soup was excellent.  I didn't use a food processor, only took a hand-held item to puree it, leaving some chunks.  Suggest using newly purchased shrimp (mine was frozen a while)!

This was delicious.  I used a can of diced tomatoes since fresh tomatoes are out of season.  I am a huge fan of feta so it was  a no brainer for me.  Definitely making this again.
