I really like this recipe with zucchini, because it isn't as greasy as most zucchini "bread" recipes.  Sometimes I add raisins, instead of walnuts, which I think goes really well with the zucchini.  Also, I often substitute whole wheat flour for half of the flour, which gives it a nice heartier texture.  This recipe is very versatile.

This is really a great recipe.  It's fast and easy and doesn't have a lot of ingredients.
A good thing to note is that the batter is very coarse and thick until you add the carrot, zucchini or apple to it; after that, the batter becomes a really nice consistency.  Makes great muffins too!

~An overall awesome recipe! I have tried the carrot version a number of times and it always turn out SO moist and delicious. The oil is a lot easier than butter or margarine and I found that this recipe uses less oil then any other carrot cake recipe I have tried. It beat my favorite cookbooks' carrot cake recipe! The only thing is that every time I make it I have to ad about 1/4 cup of water, otherwise the cake does not look like a cake batter. Nevertheless, it turns out AWESOME and MOIST!!! Thanks Carla!~~

Only just misses 5 stars. I made it using 3 cups carrot and 1 cup zucchini. This recipe uses far less oil than most recipes of this variety, and I believe that's because it uses double the carrot (zucchini/apple) that  other recipes do. The result is a super moist, yet not heavy, cake. Two things that need a little tinkering. First is sugar - 2 cups is WAY too much. I found 1-1/2 cups to be perfect. The second is the spice. As written, it was inadequate to my palate. I would up the cinnamon to 3 tsp (or one TB,) the nutmeg is fine when using apple, but I'd add 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves, as well, and get rid of the nutmeg altogether if using only zucchini and/or carrot (meaning when apple is not used.)  The 40 minute timing was dead-on in my meticulously calibrated oven, using a 9"X13" pan. Frosted it when cool with a not-too-sweet cream cheese frosting.

The "batter" turned out crumbly.  You need to add another 1/2 cup of oil and 2 more eggs to get the batter consistency.  The flour to wet ingredient ration is not correct. This recipe will not be successful without it.  After the extra ingredients are added, then it is a wonderful cake!

This bread was very moist.I used a combination of carrots and apple...yumm! I recommend that you put a little salt on the zuchinni and let the zuchinni sit for 20-25 minutes. This will get some of the water out of the zuchinni, making a lighter bread. (If you use the zuchinni.) I used brown sugar in place of the white sugar, and it was just as tasty. I also cut the amount of sugar, and the bread was still naturally sweet and yummy.

4/7/05 This is Very Yummy. My whole family loved it!! (Even those who don't like carrots). I was nervous about how dry the mixture was at first, as it said "Pour into pans" I thought no way this is ever going to pour, so I came back to the web and read the reviews... Dumpped the carrots in and sure enough, it all worked out beautifully. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

*** 9/27/06 *** We still use this recipe!! It's a family Favorite!

Notice that a lot of reviews describe this cake as "moist".  Well, that's not the word I would use.  I'd go with "wet".  Or maybe "gooey".  It's also sickeningly sweet.  I used only one and a half cups of sugar and it was so sweet that just one bite left me with an unpleasant aftertaste of sugar in my mouth for the rest of the day.  I made the apple version of this cake for an office party and the only way I could console myself for the embarrassment I endured was with the thought of writing a negative review later.  I don't think I will try this recipe again, but if for some reason I do, I'll use one cup of sugar and three cups of apple.  That might be slightly more palatable.

This (carrot) cake was absolutely delicious! I added a little bit of flaked coconut and my little ones devoured it, even my picky 5 year old! I was searching for a carrot cake that didn't use as much oil as the others and this is definitely one! This recipe is a keeper!!

LOVE this! I'm aiming for healthy, so my adjustments are as follows: half white flour & half wheat, 1 cup brown sugar (PLENTY sweet!), about 1/3 cup Canola oil + apple sauce to equal required 1/2 cup, added about 1 cup of raisins, which contributes to the sweetness. Used 1 apple, 1 medium yellow zucchini, 2 large carrots, to equal 4 cups combined. All other ingredients the same. Baked for 35 minutes.

Delicious! I did reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups to make it a tad healthier. The thickness of the batter can be disconcerting, but adding the vegetables definitely smoothens the batter to a perfect consistency.

This is one of the absolutely best cake base recipes I have ever used. I added so far: bananas, apple-pie filling, squash, carrot, pineapple, peach, blueberry-pie filling; each a different cake of course! AND I am not finished with ideas to add. I will admit to using half brown sugar sometimes and I also use 1 tsp. baking powder instead of 2 tsp soda because the soda made it too salty. I often omit the nuts but that is because I am in a rush. I already know this by heart and make it for our BnB guests for EVERY breakfast. They love it and I have had to print out the recipe for them including my additions. So glad I found this recipe. I will never be without a perfect breakfast cake to serve. It freezes amazingly! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! I can't wait to try other things to add.

I really like this recipe! I had been looking for quick bread recipes and stumbled on this. Several reasons why I find it great.I had all 3 ingredients frozen sepratley in my freezer from last summer, needing to be used. Also, this made such a tasty, healthy snack for my volunteer work at the mental wellness center. I also used Spelt flour, Pistachio and Pecan nuts needing to be used and raisons.My carrots were grated last Fall so they added to the texture quite nicely, the apples were also a thickened chuncky sauce as I did a lot of fuits that way last year. I call  this recipe my "Clean Out The Freezer Tea Cake"

I've been baking for over 45 years and have never found a recipe for a Carrot Cake that is as moist, delicous, and rich as this one!  The best part is that the ingredients are as simple and wholesome as they come.  My only substitutions were (if you can call them subs), freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon.  Hats off to the creator of this recipe, you could have not done any better!

Love this cake! We used a combination of apples and carrots, substituted one cup of flour for whole wheat, and reduced the sugar by about half a cup. I'm also pretty sure we used more than four cups of apples and carrots. The result was an incredibly moist, flavourful dessert. We enjoyed it with tea and a scoop of caramel, pecan crunch frozen yogurt. We'll definitely make this again.

This was fantastic!  I used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil and could not tell a difference.  I will try again with all applesauce.  I baked in a cookie sheet and omitted the nuts, but sprinkled the top with raisins and chocolate chips for a more brownie size cake.  These are deliciously soft and moist and flavorful.  I used part carrot and part zuchinni.  My 2 1/2 year old picky daughter, who literally gags on most vegis, loves it.  I also reduced the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups (ish) and notice no difference.  I will try again with all applesauce replacing the oil and 1 cup of sugar to try and make this as healthy of a snack as possible.  Use whole wheat flour and add some flax seed, too, if you have it.  This will not disappoint.  I am certain it will freeze well if it stays around long enough.

Extremely moist and delicious! I made some adjustments to make it even healthier. I used 2 cups carrots and 2 cups apple, all whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white (only one cup, still very sweet), .5 cup walnuts, .5 cup raisins, and yogurt instead of oil. If made with all apples, .5 cup sugar would probably be plenty. Great with brown or powdered sugar sprinkled on top. I will be making this often!

I used all zucchini in this cake since I have them stashed on every horizontal surface in my kitchen.... The flavor is great, but I find the texture a little too wet.  I'm not sure if 1 cup of zucchini can simply be left out or perhaps reduce the oil by half (which I think you could easily do).  I do plan on playing with this recipe because it's very easy and has relatively few ingredients - can be made almost effortlessly.  And, as other reviewers suggested, you can be creative with the fruit/vegetables you use.  I will also reduce the sugar the next time around.
This is definitely a recipe worth tinkering with to make it work for your application.

I came across this recipe by chance and I am so pleased I did as it seems so versatile and it makes a very nice cake.  I just used what ingrediants I had at hand,so I used 2 courgettes 1/2cup of brown sugar, I did not have any oil so I used 1/4cup of margerine ( like I said its just what I had at hand). I used almonds instead of walnuts and sprinkled a few on top for decoration just before they went in the oven. I also added raisins to my mixture,and when the cake was just out of the oven and warm I put a tbsp of honey over the cake and let it spread over the top while warm. I actually made some muffins and a loaf cake,both were wonderful. This is now one of my my 'keeper' recipes as there are so many diffiernt combinations to try out with this recipe and texture of it is lovely.

Very happy with end result.  I made with shredded baby carrots and I substituted half the sugar with Splenda.  Made a very nice cake, not too sweet.  Will probably make again and will try apples and zucchini.

I have a few good carrot cake recipes that I've been using for years but decided to try this one because it calls for twice as many carrots/apples/zucchini and half as much oil as most recipes.  This is an excellent cake!  4 stars because I think it calls for too much sugar.  I use one and a third cups.  I like using 2 c. carrots, 2 c. Granny Smith apples and half whole wheat pastry flour.  The batter is really stiff until the carrots are mixed in - don't worry, it will be moist and flavorful.  My cake is done in 35 min.

I halved this recipe, and maybe that killed it, because it was kind of disapointing—very dense and chewy.

I made this with zucchini and thought it needed something--maybe vanilla flavoring, a little allspice and less nutmeg.  It did taste better after I topped it will cream cheese frosting.  Of course anything is good with cream cheese frosting.

I tried the zucchini variation of this and it was much too sweet for my taste. I ended up having to throw the whole thing away because no one wanted to eat it.

I changed it up a little, didn't have the right kind of apples (dessert apples are far too sweet, always use baking apples!!) so I did 2 cups zucchini and 2 cups carrot!! Also switched out the eggs for egg replacer, left out the walnuts, and it tastes great!!

We loved this cake.  I used all zucchini, only 1.25 cups of white sugar, 1 full tablespoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also threw in a handful of coconut...finished this today and making another one already.  I liked this to eat for breakfast as it was more like a dense bread than a cake.

I halved the recipe, and used 1 cup of grated zucchini and 1 cup of grated apple.  (1 small zucchini and 1 small apple.) in a square casserole dish. It came out yummy,  and beautifully moist.  Like the other reviewers have stated, the batter comes out oddly dry and crumbly until the zucchini is added, but that takes care of it, and no extra ingredients are needed.  Will be making this one again, so easy and delicious!

Did a half apple, half carrot, it was moist and delicious. Added a bit of vanilla soy milk just because, and baked it in a parchment paper lined loaf pan. No mess, no cleanup, so easy.

I made this with pink lady apples, and it is AMAZING!  It's moist, and neither mushy nor greasy.  At first I thought the amount of nutmeg might be too high and might overwhelm the cake, but it turned out to be perfect!  I will make this again, for certain.  I also have wildly mischievous plans to try it with zucchini, carrot, and apple ALL AT ONCE!  It's so crazy, it just might work.

I really liked this cake because it was very easy to alter to suit my needs. I used half whole wheat, half regular flour, added golden raisins instead of pecans and used applesauce instead of oil, measure for measure. i also found that the sugar measurement is high when using apples, as some reviewers mentioned (i haven't tried the zucchini or carrot versions yet, though) so i cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. Overall, I was very impressed with this recipe and it's definitely a keeper!

This really is a strange cake - in a good way - I JUST can't get enough of it. YES it is gooey, but gooey in a good way.   The batter starts out pretty crumbly, but no need to fear that (and no need to alter the recipe), after adding the Apple/Carrot/Zucchini(mixture) it get's the right consistency.  I found out that kneading the batter with hands, after adding the veggie-stuff, is a viable option, since my mixer always gets stuck in the "crumbly" batter.   Hope this helps. ^^

I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was still plenty sweet. I used 2 cups of zucchini and 2 cups of apple, 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of regular flour.  I ground up the nuts finely and I replaced the oil with applesauce.  Made 1/2 the batter out of mini muffins (bake for 18 minutes) and one loaf pan.  My picky 5 1/5 year old ate them up like candy!  Absolutely delicious!!  Will be making these over and over again!

Very Good!!
I made this "my way" but still credit the author for the submission and idea. I used 3 cups carrots and 1 cup granny smith apple. I did not have any nutmeg, so I used allspice instead ,plus, I added 1 tbs. ginger along with the listed spices. I used splenda, instead of sugar. 1 cup only. In place of two whole eggs, I used one egg and two egg whites. 1/4 cup smart balance omega light, buttery spread (this only has 40 calories per tbls) and another 1/4 cup oil to make up the half cup oil called for. I toasted my walnuts in my toaster oven. This gives it a more robust flavor, I think. I put all my wet ingredients in the bowl first, fruit veggies and all, then added the flour, spices, etc. I lined the bottom of the baking dish with pineapple rings that are not sweetened,  then poured a little of the pineapple juice in the batter to moisten it better. Placed batter on top of pineapple and baked for 40 minutes at 325. Let cool then made cream cheese frosting with fat-free cream cheese, splenda, fat and sugar free cool whip, vanilla extract.. then ate...yum, yum !!This is so rich tasting, no one would ever guess that I had made these substitutions from the taste! My hubbie loved this cake!

Delicious and moist, easy to make. Like many others I used half carrot half apple, and I omitted the walnuts and added a dash of vanilla essence. Also, I found that my mixture was a bit too dough-like so I added maybe a couple of tablespoons of milk, but I think that was just because I used too much flour. Plus, it's healthy(ish)!

This was moist, dense, and had a weird taste to it.  It tasted just OK when it was warm, and I had high hopes for it when it cooled.  NOPE!  Much better warm.  I made this with apples and carrots, and it was just IKKY!  Not the texture of cake even, this was NOT what I was looking for!  
Sorry to the poster, nothing personal.

This recipe was very easy and came out delicious.  I didn't add frosting, whipped cream, or anything.  It was great just plain with a glass of milk.  I liked that it called for a lot of fruit/veggies and a small amount of oil, so it was a relatively healthy dessert.  I made it with a mixture of apples and crookneck squash.  I'm excited to try it with carrots.  I think what makes this so great is that it's moist and the spice mixture is just right.  I did cut down on the sugar a bit because I don't like things really sweet.  I was originally going to give it four stars because it was so moist that it was almost gooey, but the next day it had dried out just a little bit, and it was much better.  I wish I could give it four and a half.

Wonderful recipe - have made the Zucchini and the Carrot so far and I am truly impressed.  Can't wait to try
the apple version. Looks good, cuts well and seems to keep well too. I had to cook it for much longer than suggested
but that may be because we're a bit slower here in Sydney, Australia!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe! Great taste and also versatile. I was a little short of 4 cups zucchini so I threw in a small banana while shredding the zucchini and it worked perfectly.

this is a FABULOUS recipe!!  I've used it several times with various combinations of apple/carrot/zucchini, and with butternut squash and pumpkin, too.
I decrease the sugar when using naturally sweeter veggies, (down to 1 cup of sugar when using 2C Honeycrisp Apples and 2C yellow summer squash) and also adjust the baking time by 5 - 10 minutes longer when using  the juicier apples or squashes.

Delicious! (with a few minor adjustments)
3 cups carrot / 1 cup apple
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
instead of nutmeg - 1/4 tsp all spice + 1/8 tsp cloves

I made cupcakes (15 minutes @ 350 degree) and they turned out light yet very moist at the same time!

I was at a friend's home when I made this recipe so I had to make lemonade out of the lemons she had. The muffins came out quite incredible. I could not add nuts so I added raisins instead. I diced a sour apple and added it to the batter. The tangy bite of the apple balanced well the sweetness of the raisins. It sounds like a different recipe but I found these changes worked very well. One of my favorite muffins.

This was the first ever zucchini cake I have made.  Turned out so good!!  Was a little worried at first because before you add the zucchini the batter is very crumbly, but after the zucchini is added it turns into proper 'batter'  I also didn't have any nutmeg on hand so used 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead, still turned out great!!  I will definitely be making this cake again!!

I agree with you Carla. This is a terrific cake! I made it using 2 c. carrots and 2 c. zucchini and I used raisins instead of nuts. I had a bit of cream cheese icing in the fridge, so put that on and it is delicious.

yummy cake! I made some changes though- used 1.5 cups brown sugar (instead of white), used only 2 cups of  carrot/apple, and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream. The batter turned out perfect!

VERY tasty but sadly while it was cooking I decided to run out to the store to get some cream cheese for some frosting and my hubby took it out of the oven at the 40 minute mark but it wasnt cooked through yet. We still ate it but it was very gooey. Will definitely make this again  ( used carrots and zucchini) but cook much longer.

Used half carrots and half zucchini, half white and half brown sugar, half white/half whole wheat flour, added some chocolate chips and cardamom and made muffins. It turned out perfect even with all the changes. An easy flexible recipe for when the garden goodies start piling up.

This is a great cake! Very moist. I did this with 2 cups each zucchini and carrots. added pecans, and baked in 2 9" pans.  Good as a snack cake without any frosting or whipped cream, which I am sure will add to it's wonderful flavor.

Really easy and fast to make.  I only used 1 cup of sugar, and it was sweet enough for me.  I used 1 granny smith apple, and one very large carrot.  It was a winner!

I like this and have been eating it for breakfast. I tried it with 2 cups of zucchini & 1 cup of apples & used some applesauce & 1/4 cup of oil & cut way back on the sugar about 1 1/4 cups brown sugar. It turned out almost too moist...so next time I might add a little more flour...but really has a lot of great flavor. I want to try the carrots next time. Thanks for the base of a great recipe.

I think this cake is the best, without any revisions!!  I have always made it with zucchini or yellow squash - maybe that is why those who used apples found it too sweet.  I use this recipe because it uses so much less oil.  I get compliments and am asked for the recipe every time I make it.  I've always topped it with cream cheese frosting.  I have substituted pecans when out of walnuts, or just omitted the nuts but find it best with nuts included.  I want to make it with carrots sometime.  It also turned out good when I didn't have enough zucchini to measure 4 cups, with only 2 cups or so.  Thanks Carla!

This is a great cake!  I used 1 zucchini and the rest apple.  I iced it with cool-whip that I had added cinnamon and powered sugar to.  My dinner guests were a bit skeptical, but we very pleasantly surprised.  Even my 6 yr old son who refuses to eat any dessert that contains fruit asked for more!  The only 2 changes I made were to omit the walnuts and use less sugar (only 1 1/4C).  Will definitely make this one again!  Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I halfed the recipe and used a squared cake pan.  I didn't want to make too much in case we didn't like it, but it was really good. I topped it with coconut which gave it a really nice sweetness.  Very moist and delightful!  My husband enjoyed it and my poor child didn't even get a chance to taste it thanks to her dad!

It was dense which is why I gave it 4 stars, but that didn't take away from the flavor.

I made this for a family dessert because it was fast and I had all the ingredients handy, I made it with apples and had it warm with ice-cream.. and later on its own cooled. Was ok but not great.  didn't get any compliments with this one that I usually get :(  If I make it again It will be carrot version with cream cheese frosting..

Excellent recipe, and I like it has half the oil of most recipes. My favorite mix is half carrot, half zucchini. The only warning is you'd best paper the pan if you're wanting to unmold it. It stuck badly to my pans, when I rarely have that trouble with other recipes.

Everyone who tried this raved over it! My friend said it was the best carrot cake she ever had. I followed the recipe exact, but needed to bake it for 45 mins. I made my own cream cheese frosting by blending 8oz of cream cheese, 2 heaping tablespoons of cool whip, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and half cup of sugar (use a little less if u dont like a real sweet frosting)

Used carrots, really great cake! I liked the texture. Had to leave it in 5-10 minutes longer to cook through (these tiny european stoves are very unpredictable). The outsides was nice and crisp/chewy with a lovely cakey interior. The cinnamon added a nice taste. Very solid recipe.

I found that the recipe doesn't have a lot of liquid ingredients to actually make a batter.  I followed the recipe to a "T" but I found myself adding milk to it to make it into a batter.  The end result was still very good I will definately make it again

I like this recipe because it is so versatile.  I use the zucchini and whole wheat flour and it turns out good.  I think it needs to be baked longer though because it stays so moist.

This is an excellent and very easy cake - just go very easy on the sugar.
I'm not a pro cook/baker and this cake turned out perfectly.  I made it with 2.5 cups of apples and 1.5 cups of carrots.  It wasn't too moist at all, and it baked in under 35 min in my oven.  I followed the recipe exactly, except 
1) I only had one egg, so added 2tbsp ground flax seeds and 1/8 cup water to substitute for the other and
2) I only added 1/2 cup of white sugar and this was more than enough.

It's only been out of the oven for about 20 minutes, and it's already 2/3rds gone!  I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this cake with apple only. I took a previous reviewers advice and added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup oil. I also used some cloves & allspice along with the cinnamon and some nutmeg. After grating the apples, I let the juice settle at the bottom of the bowl and did NOT add the juice to the recipe to avoid excess wetness. I cooked it in 2 cake pans, one was a regular round cake pan, and the other a much darker square pan. The cake cooked perfectly in the darker pan, it cooked quicker and more evenly, whereas the cake in the 9" round pan took way longer, was a bit overdone and a still a bit wet on the inside. Both cakes took  a LOT longer than 40mins, which Im assuming why previous reviewers state having a way to wet cake. You have to test it with a wooden skewer and keep cooking till its done. I frosted the cakes with a cream cheese frosting, and the cake that didnt work out so well was fine after sitting in fridge overnight with frosting. The overdone exterior was softened by the frosting, and the wet inner part firmed up. All in all, not too bad with the few changes to the recipe!

Wonderful recipe...so easy to make, and it uses much less oil than most other cakes of this type.  I made it just as the recipe stated and used carrots from my garden.  At first it appeared that it might be to dry...but after mixing everything together...it was very moist.  Will most surely use this one again and again.

Thanks to the reviews, I added an extra egg and a big dash of extra oil. I used a mixture of apples, carrots and coconut to make up the 4 cups. It took a bit longer to cook with the extra moisture, but it came out fine and got rave reviews. I would definitely make this again.

I mix apple, carrot, zucchini, coconut and raisins together to get the four cups and I usually have to take a little bit of the juice so it's not quite so wet.

I combined 2 cups shredded zucchini and 1cup each shredded carrot and apple. It made 2 large moist loaves. I did not have parchment paper to line the pans so lost some of the bottom while taking it out of the pan. I will definitely make this again with raisins, nuts, and a handful of coconut.

I made the zucchini version. I thought that 1 teaspoon of salt was too much. (Maybe 1/2?) Also would prefer it with 1 1/2 cups sugar (not 2 cups).  
Thought it was great with wholemeal flour. 
I will be making it again with the modifications :)

This is a good recipe. I did add about 1/2 c less sugar and egg replacer powder in stead of eggs. We used half apple, half zucchini. It is quite moist and definitely didn't need more water. The veg content releases more liquid as it cooks so the batter may seem thick but as long as it's combining I think it's fine. Thanks very much for posting this easily vegan-ized recipe!

This cake was great!  But you do need to add a little more of the spices, and I only used 1 1/2 c. sugar instead of 2 c. and that was plenty.  I used 3 c. zuccini and 1 c. carrots.  Very easy to make - I used a 9X 13 pan.

Love this cake.  I made it with shredded zucchini but can't wait to try it with apple or carrot.  I made it in 2 8x8 pans & frosted it with homemade cream cheese frosting - delish.  I gave one to a friend & she LOVED it.  The cake is not very sweet so the cream cheese frosting is a nice touch.  I am sure it would make a good quick bread or muffins, too.

Following other peoples notes cut sugar to 1 1/4 cups, was preparing these for work potluck so made into muffins. Made 18 extra large muffins. Stayed fresh in an airtight container for 4 days. Will be making this again, going to try and use as a cake next time

I made this with the zucchini and my boys who are very picky loved it.  If people would follow the recipe it would not be too moist or too dry.  It is just right and is exceptional if you frost it with a cream cheese frosting.

Great cake! Very thick batter until I added the grated fruit/veggies. I used about 1/2 apple, 1/2 carrot. Topped it with cream cheese frosting (made from this site). Split into 2 8" squares (was sharing 1 cake w/a friend) and had some for us too! Yummy!

I made it with Apple and carrot combined, my family ate the entire cake in less than 2 days.  I added 1/2 tsp of ginger and iced with a 7 minute icing with 1 tsp of instant mulling spice added.  Absolutely stupendous!  My family is pesting everyday for me to make another one!

This is very good. I used half zucchini and half apples and it was scarfed down in no time flat. This is a great way to use the veggies you have from the garden. It is a wonderful fall cake that is simple and tastes great!

This recipe is GREAT!  What I love is that it's so versatile - I used about 5 apples and 2 carrots, used a little less than half the sugar called for, and substituted half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat.  The cake came out amazing.  It's perfect for breakfast and everyone in my house is gobbling it up.  Its neither too moist or too dry for the amount of oil and juices in it.  Any kind of frosting or glaze would be yummy to make it more of a dessert, but I love this cake just as it is!

Pretty tasty cake. I used half apples and half carrots to yield the 4 cups of shredded fruits and/or veggies. I also added about a tablespoon of dried ginger (fresh would be great too) which is a wonderful flavor with both apples and carrots. I do agree that the final product was slightly overly wet. Next time I will let the veggies sit for about a half of an hour and squeeze out and remove about half of the excess liquid. You need a little of the liquid because the batter is quite dry before adding the veggies. I topped it with a drizzled hard vanilla glaze, but would be good with just dusting with powdered sugar, some plain or flavored whipped cream, cream cheese icing, or just by itself. :)

I LOVE this cake!  I made it for 9 servings so it could fit in a loaf pan (which took longer to cook by about 20 min.).  I used 1 apple and 2 carrots, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and added raisins, a bit of vanilla and flax seeds and sunflower seeds instead of walnuts.  It added a bit of a nutty flavour and texture and was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

I made a version of this (3 cups of apple, 1 cup of carrot) into cupcakes (I made 24, but some of them were pretty small) with cream cheese frosting and they were oh-so-good.  The cupcakes were moist and not too sweet.  I think I'd try adding a little vanilla next time though.

Cake was very moist.  I chose to cook at a lower temperature (325) for about an hour.  It was still very moist, but would've been okay if cooked for another 5 or so minutes.  I used raw cane sugar and honey instead of white sugar.  I didn't have any vegetable oil and didn't want to use butter, so I used Olive Oil (only kind of oil I had) Will use recipe again and experiment with different vegetables.  Very yummy, if you like spice/sponge cakes.

This is very good especially warm with whop cream. I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and substituted the oil using unsweetened applesauce. I also chopped my apples up small. Will definitely make again.

I made it yesterday with apple and zucchini, because I had loads of each. I used the same measurements as the recipe states but alternated the flour mixture with the apple zucchini mixture when adding to the sugar, egg and oil and that seemed to prevent the batter from ever being too dry and crumbly. It was, in fact, a very wet batter (probably because of the zucchini) and I was able to pour it into a 9x13" pan. 

I didn't have nuts or raisins but added chocolate chipits instead, so there goes healthy out the window. 

It was very moist and sweet, I'll cut the sugar back next time. Of course the addition of cream cheese icing (my husband's suggestion) did make it sweeter, and yummier he says.  

I will make it again.  If I make it with carrots I'll increase the spices as suggested in another review.

This is a solid recipe that I use when I have an over abundance of apples, zucchini, or summer squash. I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and add 2 tsp of cinnamon. It is moist and delicious! The batter initially is extremely thick but it definitely loosens up once you add the fruit/veggies to a beautiful consistency.

I followed this recipe exact using zucchini, and the batter was super dry. If I had made this recipe as is, I would not have been able to eat the dry crumbly mess. So that is why I gave it a one star rating. The recipe does not work as is. I modified the recipe by adding 1/3 C MORE oil before baking. After baking there was absolutely no zucchini flavor, its heavily masked by all the sugar and cinnamon. If I ever make this recipe again, I’d cut the cinnamon in half, and the sugar by 1/3....

I used 2 cups carrot and 2 cups zucchini, substituted raisins for walnuts, used 1.5 cups sugar and made them into Texas-sized muffins and also some regular sized muffins. I baked the Texas-sized one 27 min and the smaller ones about 24 min. They were great..very moist! Love that is has less oil than most recipes.

As Cehouy said, the batter was dry and crumbly, so I tried what he/she did.  Added another 1/2 c. oil and 2 more eggs.  Good thing I put it in a high sided pan because it rose over the top and dripped some in the oven.  I also had to bake it 40 minutes more.    The cake is quite edible, but sunk in the middle.    I'm not quite sure how to fix this, but it pleased my roommate, so it wasn't a total loss.

I love this recipe!! I always make the carrot cake. Since the batter is so dry, next time I will add all the spices before I add the flour. Once you I have everything mixed together, I let it sit on the counter for about 30 minutes and all the moisture from the carrots blend it to the flour mixture bringing it to the proper consistency. Everybody raves about this carrot cake!! Thank you for sharing this recipe

Recipe needs serious tweaking. I skip the nuts b/c I'm not supposed to eat nuts (not an allergy thing, a digestive thing) and b/c my husband doesn't like nuts in his baked goods.
I baked this for 50 minutes and the toothpick came out clean, but after allowing it to cool, the cake was so WET (way beyond moist) that I thought it was undercooked somehow. I just think it was the batter. I used 4 cups of freshly shredded zucchini and carrot. I subbed one cup of brown sugar for the white. I added some vanilla and almond extracts.
Next time I'll only used three cups of shredded carrots and zukes, and bake for 60 minutes to dry this cake out a bit more.
My son couldn't finish his piece, but my husband went back for seconds. *shrug* It was okay, as my 3 stars reflect.

I used shredded carrots.  It had a somewhat bitter taste, and I think it's too much baking soda.  Probably won't make again.

I will most certainly make this easy, moist cake again--today!  For dietary reasons, I eliminated nuts & substituted 1 c. coconut sugar & 1/2 c. honey for the sugar.  I always bake with coconut oil.  This time I plan to reduce the salt/soda; there was more than we prefer.
Moist, heavy, scrumptious & irresistible with a healthy dose of carrots & zucchini!

I think overall, this is a good recipe, but there would be variables based upon what fruit/vegetable you used - for example, how much you drain or press out the liquid in your zucchini is going to make a difference.  So, I used half shredded carrots and half zucchini, squeezed in paper towels to remove most of the excess juice.  The batter came together nicely - was kind of crumbly, but there was still enough moisture in the zucchini to make the batter look more like batter (though not enough to "pour" it).  Smelled great in the oven, but didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting.  I think I would stick to using one type of fruit or vegetable, or maybe apple and carrot or apple and zucchini next time.  I might increase the spices, too.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it with 3 cups carrots and 1 cup zucchini.  I followed others reviews and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, didn't add the nutmeg (personal preference), increased the cinnamon to 3 teaspoons and added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves.  I switched out the oil for applesauce (1/2 cup).  I frosted it with a store bought cream cheese frosting but would have preferred a home made cream cheese or not frosting it at all and serving it with whipped cream.  Will be making again and trying different variations of apple, zucchini and carrot.

At first, my batter was more like cement and I was worried I had missed an ingredient so I came back here to check and in reading reviews saw that others said it was dry until the vegetables were added so I trusted that and just kept going.  Sure enough, as soon as the zucchini was added it immediately looked more like cake batter.  I really like the taste although my cake turned out a little rubbery, almost as if it had been cooked in a microwave.  Not sure why so chaulking it up to something done at my end; perhaps the time I spent coming back to the computer to check on the recipe.  All in all I would try this one again.

I made it with zucchini, added 1/2 cup of water, substituted 1/2 flour with whole wheat flour, and 1/2 the sugar with brown sugar.  It was awesome!

A great recipe to use up fruit and vegetable pulp from a juicer. You can use anything. My pulp from a few juices consisted of sweet potato, orange, Apple, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, lemon, and carrots. It still turned out yummy. You may have to add some liquid with this method. Will be making again.

Made this with the combination of apples, zucchini and carrots. Used in dbl recipe 2/3 cup oil and the rest apple sauce. This made a sheet cake size pan and it was enjoyed. Bake longer because of the pan size. It was for VBS.
