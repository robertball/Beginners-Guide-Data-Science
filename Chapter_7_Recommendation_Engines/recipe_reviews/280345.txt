These biscuits are amazingly delicious! They're slightly crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. I served them alongside meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They were a hit with my family and I'll be making them again and again!

Made as is several times. Excellent. Goes really good with homemade clam chowder or chicken soup.

My family and I thought the biscuits were way to salty. I will make this recipe again but eliminating the Montreal Steak. I will add some Mrs. Dash and some garlic as a replacement.

These biscuits are extremely yummy. I had to improvise with the seasoning but the family loved these and will definitely make again.

Turned out a little more buttery than I would have like, although everyone else enjoyed them, and that's what matters
