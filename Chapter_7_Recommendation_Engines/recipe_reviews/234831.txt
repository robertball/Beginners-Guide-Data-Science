I appreciate this idea !! I need to bake a few cookies, which I don't have time to do, and put them on a lovely plate, which is actually the gift. I don't even have time to think so this is great! Thank you! If you don't like it, just hit delete! LOL
AND I 'm a home economist. Sometimes..........this sort of idea just is a blessing.

With all of the cooking that I had to do for Thanksgiving dinner I thought that this recipe would be fun to do with my Granddaughter and Great Granddaughter before the turkey went into the over. And it was. I made the cookies in about 20 minutes total while my Granddaughter unwrapped the Hershey Kisses getting them ready to be put on to the cookies as soon as I took them out of the over. The taste of these simple cookies was to die for-very good indeed. The only thing I would do different and I did, is to not roll the dough in the sugar as they are already very sweet. Simple can be a great idea.

Geez!!!!  My wife makes these and the whole family likes them. 
And yes, she can do alot more then boil water but sometimes an easy 
bake gives you a break!!!  Hint from my baker, wife, make own cookie 
\dough. Better then premade dough but still good.

I just had to review this since I usually bake everything from scratch - but this is a good idea.  At Christmas time when I have multiple batches of 7 different cookies I make for parties and gifts, taking a short cut once in a while is such a time saver! I actually wouldn't think of doing this, but to save some time for holiday baking I just might do this for a cookie or 2!

I had just grabbed a package of these while at the grocery store.  What a nice surprise when the recipe popped up the following day!  I love to cook when I have the time and try the new recipes on the Allrecipes site.  These cookies look homemade, taste delicious, and are a nice quick treat on a busy day!

My grandaughter made these while I was preparing dinner.
This was wonderful for her. She made desert for the family, on a busy night and was very proud of herself
They were also quite tasty
This is a first for us as I am an experienced cook, but I think people who gave a harsh review, have totally missed the purpose of this posting. Relax people, if complex is needed, surf the site. All Recipe has huge amounts of wonderful 
cookie recipe.
All things said, thanks for posting this recipe.

This is where my 4 star comes from

I made them, they are good. However, it seems to be taking a long time for the Hershey's kisses to harden up after being made soft from the warm cookie.  Any suggestions anyone?

Brought these cookies to work, with many praises! I modified a little. Didn't roll in sugar (these are peanut butter, not sugar cookies!) and I stuck Reese's mini PB cups on top, for a little more peanut taste. Quick and delicious.

I have tried this recipe a few times and it is a great time saver for busy folks. Most people have no idea their not made from scratch. I used to scoff at people who used refrigerated cookie dough, but now I see the value in it. I only have one problem. I live at a high altitude (over 7000 feet) and I had once found instructions to add flour to the dough, but I have not been able to find them again so I can't remember how much to add. The cookies are a lot flatter without the added flour. Does anyone know how much flour to add at high altitude?

This was super easy and delicious! I make enough homemade cookies, so one simple recipe could not hurt! Thanks for sharing!
