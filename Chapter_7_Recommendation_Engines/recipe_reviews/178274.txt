I used this on a fairly thin very cheap cut of meat and it was fabulous. I did make a couple of alterations since I did not have dijon or soy sauce, substituted plain yellow mustard and teryaki sauce.  everybody L O V E D IT!!!!!

I'm a vegetarian, but I don't let that keep me from the pleasures of marinating! I let some baby portobello mushrooms sit in this overnight, then sauteed them with about 1/3 cup of the leftover marinade and a bit of oil. I am eating them right now and I seriously think they are the most delicious mushrooms I have ever tasted! The only thing I might do differently next time is omit the salt, since the soy sauce is quite salty already and the extra sodium seems superfluous.

Oh my god, this marinade was awesome! I can't think of a single thing i'd change. The whiskey flavor was subtle but tasty.  

Mixed it with some ground beef and formed it into patties for hamburgers. Than while they were cooking, I used a pastry brush to add a little bit more flavor. DELICIOUS!

I used sirloin tip steak and marinated it for 24 hours, but still was found the steak a bit tough.  I was hoping it would have been more tender.  I guess this would have been better with a more expensive cut of steak.  But I wouldn't use this recipe again.

WOW! I have tried several marinades from this site and others and this one surpassed all of them. I did omit the added salt because of the soy sauce. Wonderful for steaks, turkey cutlets, chicken and pork. You can adjust/add spices/herbs of your choice to suit your taste buds. However I would suggest you try the basic recipe first and then adjust or add favors. A good quality whiskey is the key.

Just leave out the salt. The soy sauce has plenty.

My husband, the Steak Meister, said "These are the best steaks I've pulled off the grill" - and that's saying something!  Made exactly as directed using Crown Royal - was a little worried about the mustard, but it worked fine.  I did try reducing the leftover marinade to use as a dipping sauce - nope - mustard flavor too pronounced - but I digress.  As a marinate, this is Da Bomb!  I did use low sodium soy sauce and nixed the salt - forgot that.

Delicious!  I did add fresh garlic, basil, & oregano.  I skipped the salt and used home made hot and spicy mustard.  Wonderful base recipe you can play around with.

Excellent!  I marinated chicken breasts overnight, then breaded and pan-fried them and served with a gravy made from the excess marinade.  Big hit with the whole family!

I didn't think I would like all that sugar in the marinade but the flavor did work.  I'd rather give this a 4 1/2 stars because I'd like to add some garlic to this and I wouldn't expect this marinade to tenderize my steak but it did have really good flavor and everyone here liked it.

I was looking for a recipe comparable to the TGIF sauce.  This isn't quite it, but it's good.  I'm not sure what it's missing, but didn't seem to have the full flavor of the TGIF sauce.  Tasty though.

My boyfriend loved this marinade on chicken, but be warned the whiskey flavor is too strong for tofu!  It might be good if you only marinade the fu for an hour or so.  I left it over night and every bite was like a shot of liquor.  It's a great marinade for meats though, I'll probably try it again with seafood.

I grill year round and use marinades a lot.  This was by far the best marinade ever!  I marinaded a London Broil for eight hours before grilling, and everyone raved about how good the meat was.  We eat a lot of London Broils, and this was the best ever!  Thanks

Marinated some steak kabobs in this marinade & the men in my life loved it.  I had to sub dijon for a combo of honey mustard and spicey brown mustard since that is all I had.  Will be using this recipe again!

This was really good & kept our meat juicy & tender.  We process our own beef & ended up with some roasts that are just too dry when done in a crockpot so I cut it into chunks & let it set in the marinade for about an hour & 1/2 then I dropped the chunks into hot oil b/c it cooks them quickly & seems to keep them from drying out as well.  I was worried my kids wouldn't like it but they did.  We aren't big hard liquor drinkers so all we had was Jim Beam, next time I will make a point to buy Jack Daniels and try it on some steaks on the grill!  Thanks for a great marinade!

I used this marinade on some rib eyes for dinner this evening and this was definitely a thumbs down from everyone.  The taste was too sweet for us.  We won't be using this one again.

This was SOOOO good. I didn't have time to marinate overnight, so I stabbed the heck out of the steaks and let it marinate for an hour and a half, then grilled it. No A-1 required!!! Thank you!

This is my new favorite marinade.  I used it to marinade chicken thighs and drumsticks.  I followed recipe exactly.  I've never bought drumsticks (took skin off) but they were on sale so thought kids would enjoy this and I was right, adults like it also.  We BBQ it for daughter's 16th birthday and this was everyone's favorite.

Marinated chicken breast for 4 hours before cooking and it was delicious.  A wonderful blend of flavors the whole family liked it.  I was careful not to grill it on the hotspot of our grill and it cooked up beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! Perfect flavor consistency. I wanted to try it right away so I modified a little: I cooked some garlic/butter in a pan and browned 2 boneless chicken breasts, brushed with brown sugar and soy sauce. Once they had cooked, I added the whiskey marinade and let it simmer for awhile. It was fantastic, even without marinating! It tasted good the next day, too. I'll definitely try this again, maybe with salmon.

Great flavor, I have taken it to the next level and tried with many different beef dishes including fajitas and corned beef. Best of course is still on the grill and a sure crowd pleaser.

I would've given this a 4 but all my guests gave it a 5! Used it on an ostrich steak and it was so tender and juicy. I really like that there's no oil so there were no flareups on the bbq. Will definately use this again! Thanks!!

This is a delicious marinade for those that like the whiskey flavor. I followed the recipe except I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the teaspoon of salt because think it would have been way too salty otherwise. I used Makers Whiskey and marinated my chicken for 24-hours. Everyone thought it had a very rich flavor so I will be making it again.

This was awesome. I used beef tenderloin steaks. I wasn’t able to marinate it overnight as suggested (about 4 hours) and it still was amazing. I was going to take a photo of this dish,but it wasn’t on our plates long enough. I recommend this dish !

I have made this many times, often using the cheapest whiskey available. The green onions are good, but in a pinch, minced garlic works well.

I marinated boneless chicken thighs for about 5 hours. My husband bbq’d them. They were so tender, we really enjoyed the flavour as well. I used 1/3 cup whiskey, not 1/4 beacause I always like to taste the alcohol in the sauce. And I chopped up a shallot instead of a green onion, yum. I will make again but try marinating the meat longer. Very nice, thanks!

This is a definite keeper.  All ingredients are easy and on hand.  I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and let some good bone in chops sit in the marinade for 6 hours.  Really good flavor on the grill.  Will be using again!

i'm not too sure how fair a review i can give this as i had to make a couple of substitutions given what we had on hand.. bf liked it alright and i'm thinking i just don't care much for sweet.. i halved the salt.. then subbed horseradish flavored brown mustard for the dijon and maple syrup for the brown sugar.. marinated thin bone in pork chops and grilled them up with some applewood smoke.. i've tried whiskey marinades before and also didn't care much for them.. so it might be a personal preference thing.. i'll stick with white wine or tequila marinades

Good flavor but it didn't help tenderize the meat as I expected. Tri-tip isn't normally tough, but this time it was. I'd likely use this marinade for chicken only next time.

I wouldn't make this again.  If you like mustard this is the recipe for you.  The mustard overtakes the meat.  That is all I tasted was the mustard.  Not sure what all the hoopla is about this recipe........I made the sauce and marinated baby back ribs with it.

I double the recipe and leave the whiskey at 1/4 cup.  All other ingredients are at 1/2 cup.  This is a fabulous marinade and everyone loves it when I serve it.  It is a sweet and savory recipe.  The next time I make it, I may add some red pepper flakes or perhaps a little Sriracha Sauce to give it a little heat on top of the sweet and savory.

Very good marinade. To open the flavor profile of the sweeter ingredients (the whiskey and brown sugar) add about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. It will also help to break down dome of the muscle fiber aiding the tenderization of the meat.

I have used it on tri tip a few times using Jack Daniels. Really adds a great but not overwhelming flavor, seems to help tenderize the meat.

I marinated some huge chicken breasts for 20 min and then I decided to just bake them for an hour in the marinade. It turned out great! Even my 3 year old loved it. I left out the salt.

This was just amazing. I used it on Black Angus top sirloin from Trader Joe's. I don't normally keep whiskey in the house but I had a small bottle leftover from a visitor. I think I'll be stopping in at our liquor store on occasion now just so I can make this amazing marinade.

Loved it exactly like it was but I wonder if anything could replace the whiskey?  We rarely have it in the house.

Love, love, love!! My only major tweak was to use honey instead of brown sugar because I just don't keep brown sugar on hand. The minor tweak was since I used Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey Whiskey (my absolute favorite of all time) was to reduce the honey amount by half ;-) Grilled with both boneless skinless chicken thighs and pork tenderloins (two batches of marinade) and will grill top round steak next time :-)

I used this on steak and it was great. I was apprehensive because I am not a huge fan of mustard, but it was not overpowering in any way. The flavors blended together very nicely.

We really liked this recipe. I marinated sirloin steaks in it before pan-frying for a couple of minutes on each side, to medium rare. Very nice with a simple salad and some potato wedges. I tried to make a sauce by boiling down the leftover marinade. This didn't work - i think due to the high sugar content, it tasted a bit burnt and bitter. The steaks didn't need a sauce anyway, as they were really tender and tasty with the marinade alone.

This is probably one of the best marinades I have ever had. I used for strip steaks last night and my family loved it.  Didn't change a thing.

Beyond superb!! I really don't like the taste of whiskey straight from the bottle (can't even stand the smell!), but in this marinade, it blends with all the other flavors and creates a feast for the tastebuds! It makes the most flavorful steaks you can imagine. I only changed two things: This recipe does not need more salt, so I omitted that and I added 3 garlic cloves, finely minced. Yum!!
