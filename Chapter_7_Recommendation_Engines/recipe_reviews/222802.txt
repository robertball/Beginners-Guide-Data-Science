The recipe submitter doesn't say how she/he serves this.  I can't see this as either a main course or a side dish, so I'm assuming appetizer??  At any rate, that's how I served it.  It simply doesn't have much flavor.  Mostly all you can taste is the frankfurter itself...the chili powder just a little, but the garam masala not at all.    I tasted it as written, then added more garam masala and chili pepper, and even a little more ketchup, but it still was pretty bland and even a little gummy.  To salvage, I ended up adding some red guajille chile sauce.  As written, I'd give this 2 stars, but this rating reflects the few modifications made. We ate it, but won't be making this one again.

Amazing little snack. I used tikka masala instead of garam masala and it worked wonders.
