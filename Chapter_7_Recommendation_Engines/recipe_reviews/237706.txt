Oh Huey59, how could you?  Right now during swimsuit season! This is very decadent. The cake is more like a brownie and the whole thing tastes very much like the candy bar. I made the recipe exactly as written, the only change I might make in the future is the make the coconut layer a little creamier instead of so dry, but it's still delicious. Thank you for the recipe, I will add this to my permanent recipe box.

My son absolutely loves this cake. Don't make the mistake I did by adding some cream to the coconut mixture. I got worried when one reviewer called it dry. Mine slides off the cake. Still tastes great.  The cake part is decadent. A real treat.

Oh yum yum and yum! So sweet and so rich but delicious. We just loved this. It is more of a brownie but it soaks up all the lovely of the cocount mixture. Worth the calories every single bite!

This was great. A big hit. It is really a brownie and not a cake though. Also, I put a layer of chocolate ganache on top instead of canned or packaged frosting. Why make a cake from scratch and not the frosting?

This was a big hit!  My husband loves Mounds candy bars so I thought I would try making this for his birthday!  He took it to work and people were coming from all over the building to eat this wonderful rich cake...It is sweet and you only need a small piece.

So i made this, except i made my own fudge frosting. They are really rich! Also I would leave in the fridge longer than 15 minutes. 

The concept is great! They taste fantastic. My family really enjoyed them. They took about an hour to make. 

Thank you for the recipe!
