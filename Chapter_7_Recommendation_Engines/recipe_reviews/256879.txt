I added some garlic powder and let the cheese balls marinate for a bit before stuffing the peppers. Delicious ! Perfect and easy. I will make them again soon. We loved these.

Fresh and delicious. Made as written and loved it as such. You can turn these into little people by using balsamic vinegar glaze dots to make a face on the cheese and basil leaves as feet. The kids love them like that. Thank you for the recipe.

I added some garlic powder.  Let mine sit in the fridge to marinate a bit then brought back to room temperature before serving.  Will certainly make again!

Wasn't a fan... is the pc pickled sweet peppers different from cherry peppers? If so, where do you get the right kind?
