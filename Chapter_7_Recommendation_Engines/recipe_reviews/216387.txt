I'm truly not sure how to rate this recipe. I'll start by saying that the turkey tasted great but I didn't really taste the flavors from the brine and the ingredients are too expensive to waste on something I'm not tasting. I've used other brines before and I don't feel the other ingredients added anything special. The cranberry juice dyed the bird an unappetizing pink and it browned way too quickly. I covered with foil but the skin was almost black by the time it was done. So in the future I think I'll pass on the frozen juices but use other features from this recipe.

This was my first try at brining a turkey and I researched it for hours! This brine was something a little different and it turned out great. We have a new tradition for turkey!

I've never had my turkey get stained...Only thing I have ever had was praise for how good, tasty, and moist it is.

I used this for Christmas dinner.  I used some cranberry apple cider, too.  I then made a cranberry injectate to add some more citrus flavor.  I used my ninja and ground up fresh cranberries, 2 oranges (peeled), a lemon (peeled), 3 cloves garlic, lemon pepper and some more cranberry-apple cider.  I then strained it and used the thin liquid to inject in the bird.  I also kept the solid and used that as a rub for the outside.  There were a lot of compliments on the flavor and moisture. This is my 2nd time brining and I won't ever cook a turkey without it again!

I have used this recipe at least five times and it consistently turns out a moist turkey. I follow the recipe as is. Does to need any tweaking.

This year was my first time brining my meat. I used this as the base brine on my Christmas cornish hens. I added a few other spices, a little smoked paprika and red pepper for a kick.
The hens baked and the flavor was throughout the meat. They baked evenly and we're moist. 
My family loved them. I can't wait to try it this summer with other meats and cooking methods.

#2 debone Turkey with the exception leg's. thigh's and wing's this will    expose more of the breast to the brine.
