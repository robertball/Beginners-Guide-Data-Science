My mom used to make us Penuchi when I was a child and I never forgot how scrumptious it was. This recipe is very close to hers but she used walnuts and no marshmallow. Until I can find the version she used this one will work very well! It's delightfully yummy.

I am making this for a class and I was wondering can I refrigerate or leave on counter?  And can I add powdered sugar? Do I have to add marshmallow fluff?
