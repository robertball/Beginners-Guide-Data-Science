I sauteed the garlic and a little chopped onion in the olive oil before tossing it with the steamed green beans and spices. That's a must. These were absolutely delicious. This is my new favorite green bean recipe......and it's so simple!

Great side dish! I used steam in the bag green beans, black pepper vs. white, added a little butter along with the olive oil and used a lot more garlic.  I sometimes put a bit of parmesan cheese depending what we're having as the main dish.

I have to say, this is my family's favorite way to have beans fresh-picked from the garden!!  The kids love them, as do my wife and I.  Our version steams the beans separately while I slowly warm light olive oil with about 4 cloves chopped garlic, salt and pepper to "infuse" the oil. When the beans are hot, but still crisp, I toss them in the pan with the oil and serve immediately.  YUM!  Best beans ever!!

A friend (Karyn) gave me this recipe a few years ago and I've been making it since.  I definitely add more garlic.  I also warm the olive oil and garlic in a pan before tossing the green beans into it to warm a little longer.  It's so delicious!

My good old stand-by way of preparing green beans - or most any vegetable for that matter.  I often add bacon, as I did tonight.  Be careful of the cooking time - it should take a mere 5 minutes, tops.

I've been using this recipe for over a year now and it is a HUGE hit with my family!  Even my picky eater loves her garlic green beans!  However, I do a few things differently. I use 2T. Smart Balance butter in place of the olive oil; I add 3T. minced garlic and let it brown slightly; I do not use any water, (unless I have fresh green beans) I let my frozen green beans cook down and the moisture from them is plenty.  I then add salt and pepper while I'm sauteeing them. I also carmalize them, like you would onions.  Very yummy recipe!

Great recipe! I added more garlic and heated it in a pan with the olive oil. I also steamed my fresh green beans before quick frying them in the garlic and oil. Tasted delicious and went really well with the Filet Steaks and grilled mushrooms.

Delicious! Simple and easy to make. I boiled hot water then added the string beans. After 1 minute I turned off the stove, covered the pot and let it sit. I seasoned the string beans with Hawaiian sea salt, pepper, minced garlic and a drizzle of olive oil. Loved the simplicity of this recipe yet its still serves as a great side dish! Much better than plain ole' string beans. Tonight I served this along with, "Mushroom Pork Chops," and "Bacon Rosemary Mashed Potatoes," all from this website, and also delicious I might add.

I made this with Filet Mignon with Mushroom-Wine Sauce, which involves a lot of quick, little steps.  Unfortunately, I didn't have all of my ingredients for either recipe pre-measured, so in the interest of having everything ready at once, I kind of dumbed this down a little.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh, plus I eyeballed all ingredients.  Even still, this recipe was very good!  It was so simple (next time, I will use fresh garlic...scout's honor!!) and I really loved the white pepper.  Per the first reviewer's suggestion, I didn't go light on the garlic.  I will definitely make again - these can go alongside anything!!  UPDATE: These have become a standard side dish in our home.  Now, I make sure to use fresh garlic and pre-measure my ingredients.  These green beans are SOOO easy to make, and they really taste awesome!

Nice & easy recipe. I tweaked by blanching the green beans and then sauteing garlic in extra virgin olive oil before tossing in the green beans. I sprinkled with sea salt before serving.

I needed to use up a half bag of frozen green beans, so I steamed them in a steamer bag with 1 T butter, salt to taste, minced garlic to taste (even an extra sprinkling of garlic powder while stirring them). I subbed out a bit of black pepper for the white, as I don't care for white pepper. These were a very good way to dress up plain, old frozen green beans. I cannot wait to try this with the fresh ones!

Simple and tasty.  If you want to keep the beans crispy & green, add a squeeze of lemon to the water.  This is a favorite dish around our house.  Goes good with any meal.  DO NOT OVERCOOK or the beans will lose their green color.

These are a pretty quick and easy way to flavor green beans. I just used some frozen green beans, defrosted them in some hot water, and microwaved them. I also just used pre-chopped garlic making it even simpler. I thought it was a tad salty, so I will just cut that back a little next time. Thanks, it will go great with my meal tonight.

Simple, and delicious! Yum! I used butter instead of olive oil so they'd be extra rich. Salted the water. Only had to cook for aobut 5 minutes to be al dente. Also added some lime pepper, and a little more pepper than called for. Adding bacon would be awesome too.

An easy and quick way to make green beans! My husband liked them so much that he was eating them out of the pan while we were waiting for the rest of the meal to finish cooking. Great recipe, Howard!

Very good. I sauteed the green beans in EVOO until tender/crisp then heated the garlic. Tossed with salt and pepper. Served with Chicken and rice casserole. Easy, tasty supper. Will make over and over.

Simple and delicious!  Served with the balsamic glazed slamon recipe from this site, and it was the perfect compliment.

Great green beans. I used canned french style green beans so they weren't tender-crisp.  The next time I would use frozen instead to fix this. This was a nicely flavored dish, not too garlicky either.

Fantastic use of fresh green beans, but I did have to cut down on the salt.  I don't like salty foods and the original amount was overpowering.

These were very good.  I think next time I would add some garlic powder instead of minced garlic because sometimes you got a chunk of garlic.  But I will be making these again.

I sauted the garlic in the olive oil before tossing in with the beans.  Added a little butter too... great classic way to eat green beans!

I like this recipe for a quick and easy way to spruce up green beans. I add a little garlic powder to this since I cannot get enough of the garlic taste. I make this recipe just about every time I make green beans. Fresh beans are best, but I have made this with frozen green beans as well.
