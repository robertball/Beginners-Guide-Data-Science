I followed recipe as exactly as possible. It said to make crust in a shape, but not how thick? I put it back in the oven for several minutes past what was recommended, but it still fell apart. DH like the taste, I felt like I was eating a bland oatmeal cookie. I added some tomato sauce to mine to hide the taste. He wants to try it again with different toppings, we will see!

I was looking for a pizza with a non-yeast crust.  This was great!  My family loved it! I will pass this on to my daughter since it is also a gluten free recipe1
