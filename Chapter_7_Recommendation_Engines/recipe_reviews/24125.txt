Absolutely wonderful pie -- great for hot summer days when you don't want to heat the oven!  Only thing I did differently is increased the milk from 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups when mixing the pudding part.  With 1 1/2 cups it was very 'grainy' but the extra 1/2 c milk gave it a smooth, creamy texture and still set up perfectly!

This was delicious! I couldn't find cherries (sold out), so I did as another reviewer suggested and used raspberries. I couldn't justify not using all of them though, so I mixed all but 8 of the berries in with the top layer of whipped cream, layered on top of the chocolate pudding layer, and then garnished with some sliced almonds that I had left over from another pie, some toasted coconut, and the rest of the berries. Had I had some extra chocolate on hand, this would have been very pretty lightly dusted with cocoa powder and with some chocolate curls. One thing though, I have never heard of whipped topping envelopes in my life. When I asked about them at the grocery store, no one had any idea what I was talking about. I decided to go ahead and use  two 8 ounce packages of fat free cool whip instead. When I initially added the chocolate pudding mix to the one 8 oz package of cool whip, it was kind of pasty, so I decided to add some 1% milk. I added a cup, and it was still kind of grainy, so I added another cup. It was good, but didn't set up as well as I would have liked. Next time I think I will try using only 1 1/2 cups of milk.

Great idea.  None of my family likes coconut, so I used a graham cracker crust instead.  Used cool whip instead of Dream Whip (the pkged kind)  It was yummy and I'll be making 4 for Christmas dinner this year.  Thanks

it was ok, not as rich as I'd hoped.
