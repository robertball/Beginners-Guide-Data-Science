Oh my goodness, these were a blast to make! I made these "lighter" by using sugar free Jello, sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding and "lite" frozen topping, this way I could eat these right along with the rest of my family. I had such fun making these and my whole family loved eating them. I'll make these again for sure as I can see these being a great summer "treat".

These were so easy, super fun, delicious and totally cute! I don't know if there's a typo in the recipe, or if my egg molds are larger or what, but I used 3oz. boxes of gelatin (so I could do a few different colors), and I only got 3 eggs filled, which would mean that a 6oz. box would only fill 6 egg molds and not the 12 specified. It was no big deal, but I just wanted to let others know to mabe plan to use more gelatin if they want the specified amount. Other than that, me and the little guy LOVED making these and can't wait to try other flavors. Oh, and the whipped topping mixed w/ the pudding mix was a great idea. It gave it a lot more flavor than just using the whipped topping alone. These are a great, creative idea and a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were so fun and easy to make.  I couldn't find the egg mold so I used my egg plate as a mold and it worked out well.  Just use cooking spray so they slide out easily.  We used lemon jello and added a drop of food coloring to the "egg" to make more colors.   Thanks so much for a great recipe that really added a nice touch to our Easter.  I think this will become a tradition in our family.

My granddaughters and I made these for Easter.  We used "mixed berry" flavor, which made them a blue color.  It's always fun to make a mold of some kind with the grandkids.  Even if it flops, it's a fun memory, and we all have a good laugh if it plops out in a "surprise shape."   They tasted good, too!  A cute addition to the Easter buffet!   I would suggest getting at least two sets of molds.

These were a lot of fun to make with my kids and turned out adorable and delicious. I made one small change, which was to use banana pudding in place of vanilla because that's what I had in my pantry...it was so yummy. These will become an Easter tradition at our house.
