We really enjoyed this! I did need to add more s&p, but that's just personal preference an I used what I had on hand, which was Yukon gold potatoes. I think next time I may roast some whole garlic cloves also. Another thing, while everything coked up fine as is, I think I would roast them at a higher temp so the potatoes get more of a golden color. Really nice to go along with our dinner tonight and everyone liked it! Thanks for sharing. :)
