Brownies turned out overly sweet, with an odd texture; not especially appealing.
The freezing and thawing process went pretty smoothly, and the baking time seemed accurate, but the finished brownies do not look like the picture at all.  They are a typical dark brown brownie, so, instead of having an obvious layer of raspberry in the middle, they just appear gooey and underdone.  The raspberry flavor was nice, though.  
I might try this process again with a better brownie recipe.  As written, these were nothing special and I would not serve them to guests.

I followed the directions exactly and the brownies came out yummy. I think the problem with the texture that the other reviewer mentioned was due to the step NOT included in the directions - when melting chocolate for brownies, it is imperative that it cools down before mixing in the flour, otherwise it will come out cake-like, instead of brownie-like.

I really liked the raspberry, but this was a very fussy recipe, for a brownie recipe. Maybe I will try swirling in the raspberry next time.

PS to Smuckers - I used Bonne Maman brand, as it has raspberries as the first ingredient, rather than sugar (Smuckers Organic) and does not contain High Fructose Corn Syrup & Corn Syrup (Smuckers Red Raspberry Preservers)

This recipe was very easy.  I used frozen raspberries from my garden instead of the preserves.  I had to bake the brownies about 10 minutes longer, but they were very moist and delicious.

Used 1 c of sugar, 2 eggs & 1/4c butter, 1/2c greek yogurt. Also substituted fresh raspberries for preserves. A little bit kinder version, & secret is no one knew!

Tastes great with far less sugar and homemade sugarless raspberry jam. Not as dense as brownies could be though.
