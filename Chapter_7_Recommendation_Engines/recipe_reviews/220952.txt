I made this and everyone loved it.  I would recommend it more for the fall or winter.  It just has that type of flavor to it.

I made this last Easter for my church potluck. People raved and demanded the recipe. I have already been asked if I will be bringing the ham and cherry glaze for this coming year.

Made this for tonight’s Easter ham.  I wanted something different from the usual pineapple or raisin glaze and this was perfect.  I didn’t make any substitutions with ingredients but the proportions were just eyeballed until it seemed right.  A keeper.

Easy and quick and it was very well received by all that had it.  Thanks for the post.  Also, tried this as a topping for vanilla ice cream.  Trust me on this one, it was well received as well.

Made it exactly as the recipe says. Everyone said it was different than anything they had ever tasted AND everyone absolutely LOVED it!!!! I don't think I'll ever use a different glaze recipe again!

Used this on a ham yesterday in a pre-Christmas trial.  It sure turned out well!  Both husband and adult son commented on how good it was.  I did add a little cinnamon and clove.  Thanks!!
