I don't know about the best but this did turn out pretty good. I used lime instead of lemon due to personal preference and because I wanted a good crisp on the skin, I took it out of the foil and placed it directly on the grate for the last 15 minutes. For my serving I decided to glaze it with Sriracha and that was an excellent choice. The other 3 servings without the Sriracha turned out good too though. Super simple recipe and one worth firing up the grill for.
