Like AcaCandy, I used this on chicken rather than salmon.  I've often topped chicken with mustard and soy sauce.  This is a nice improvement on that.  I didn't put all of the sauce on the chicken, and used the remainder as a dipping sauce.  I plan to try this on salmon, too.

Followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Didn't have any honey mustard so made my own.  Looks like I got two new recipes out of one meal.  Yes, will definitely do it again.

This was pretty good--easy to make and to clean up, too.  I used sockeye salmon--the first time I've actually bought that kind--and maybe that wasn't my best choice.  I think that next time I make this I will add capers to the packet!  I will make this again using another type of salmon.  Thanks, TIMJCRAWFORD!

I'm rating just the sauce as I was fresh out of salmon and used chicken instead, but the sauce is totally awesome!!! I did sub olive oil and lime juice as lemons are hard to find here and I prefer  to cook with olive or avocado oil.
