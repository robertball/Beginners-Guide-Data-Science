There are quite a few reviews for this recipe on this site already.  However I felt inclined to put a review in since this particular listing of the recipe said there aren't any reviews and I'd hate to see anyone miss out on this wonderful, easy, and so kid friendly recipe.  I measure, my kids mix and the best part is their getting to get all their fingers in there and smush them around in the dough.  Then when it's time to bake them they once again get to literally dig their hands into it when they roll the dough into balls and roll them in the sugar.  Then the very best part is when the cookies come out of the oven and they get to take all the kisses I made them unwrap (and not eat) and they get to push them down in the center of each cookie.  They both feel like they are solely responsible for the wonderful treats they helped create!  So if you are looking for a quick, easy, no-fool, recipe that you can let the entire family participate in making not just eating this one is one of the best!!!

These cookies are fantastic!
When I finished mixing the batter I thought, what...no baking soda, baking powder or salt......NO FLOUR?
But let me tell ya the ease of this recipe is notig cmpared to the great taste!
I flattened mine out with a sugared bottom glass and bam!  Awesome cookies.
Oh, I also added 1 cup od dark chocolate chips.
One thing you have to watch for is over baking.  If you wait for them to turn golden brown, they are burnt on the bottom.  They are a very light blonde almost when done.
OH YUM!

Okay I had to try these because there was such a discrepancy between people's opinions. I thought they were great. Not a traditional cookie texture almost a cross between a peanut butter cookie and a peanut butter ball. DON'T overcook, the sugar is browning on the bottom and they are best when just barely done!

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe that I have ever tried.  I love soft moist cookies, so these really hit the mark.  The last time I made these I doubled the recipe and added a bag of mini chocolate chips...Yummy!  My only advice is to be aware of the cookies light color and don't overbake.

Oh my goodness! I made half a batch of these to use up half a can of condensed milk that I had sitting around. These are fantastic! If you don't like dry, crumbly, crunchy peanut butter cookies, these are for you! I'm going to use this instead of the peanut blossom recipe my family has been using for years. I might up the peanut butter a little or add some chopped peanuts to give it more peanut flavor.

After seeing all the positive reviews, I just had to try this recipe.  Well, I used all the listed ingredients and found these to be the most tasteless cookies I have ever baked in all my years of baking.  However, oddly enough, both people who tasted them liked them a lot.  I am changing this from a 1-star rating to a 3-star rating, but will not use this recipe again.  I also found they would not bake fully on an insulated cookie sheet (after 18 mins they were still not fully baked), but baked normally on a normal, non-insulated sheet, done in 9-10 mins.

Very simple and delicious recipe. I am always asked did you make these they taste store bought. Eagle brand is sweet and I guess some may want to be careful in choosing the brand of peanut butter they use. This recipe is most definately a keeper.

I have been making this recipe for years and I always get compliments on these super simple cookies. To make them extra special I use the chunkiest peanut butter I can find and when they come out of the oven I use dark chocolate Hershey Kisses for the centers. These are quick and easy cookies that are a great
'go to ' recipe when you need something fast and simple.

Delicious cookies...not your usual PB cookie by a longshot!  This recipe yields cookies that are slightly chewy and light -- almost cake-like in texture.  The flavor is not overly sweet (and may taste "not-sweet-enough" if you are accustomed to a high-sugar diet), but with that said, they are plenty sweet.  Additionally, I did not find them to be salty, as some of the reviewers mentioned.  

If you are expecting a traditional, crispy peanut butter cookie (that is, very sweet and very peanut-buttery), this is not it. 

I baked a dozen (approx 10 mins to cook rather than the shorter recommended time) and froze the remainder in small batches so we can have warm-out-of-the-oven cookies with minimal effort in the weeks to come.  I do think these would be fantastic with a Hershey kiss or a jelly center as well and will likely experiment with different toppings/centers as well as crunchy peanut butter in future batches.

*Brand Note:  I used Bisquick brand, JIF omega-3 PB and 1 1/4 c homemade sweetened condensed milk.

I've been making these peanut butter cookies for years. They never get hard, and stay delicious. I recently sent a batch to Afghanistan. Even through a week of shipping and the desert heat, they still stayed soft and delicious.

These were awful! The worst PB cookies I have ever tried. I have never given a bad review but these were just that off. They tasted salty, and as if there was NO sweetner in the mix. The peanut butter did not come thru in the taste either. I used "Jiffy" PB and EagleBrand Sweetened Condensed milk - not an off brand and it was a total waste of ingredients. Needless to say I won't even try this one again.

An excellent peanut butter cookie. i love a soft cookie and these fit the bill. Very flavorful too. Received many many compliments on these at Christmas. I did bake them a tad longer than recipe said though. It's a keeper.

These cookies were just alright.  They had a very cakey/biscuit flavor to them. (probably due to the bisquick) I doubt I'll make this recipe again.  My husband didn't like the regular cookie but when I made the second batch as the peanut butter and jelly gems he likes those more.  I'm giving it three stars due to the fact that the second batch was more palatable .

These turned out soft and chewy as promised, which I love, however I found them to be a little dry and not as peanut buttery as my usual recipe.  I did use low fat condensed milk b/c that's what I had...  I might try again with a little more PB and regular condensed milk.

This recipe provides a much stronger flavor than the other easy peanut butter cookie recipes on this site (due to the extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter). No need to add the egg. This recipe is great because it comes together so quickly and always comes out the same way.

AMAZING cookies! This recipe has been in our family for years. It is always a crowd pleaser. My in-laws asked me to make them another batch tonight. I wouldn't believe the review that says that these are bad cookies and there is no taste of sweetener. Obviously there is. The recipe calls for Eagle Brand milk (VERY sweet) and also sugar, can't get any sweeter than that! I found the cook time to be pretty much right on, I made mine a bit bigger so they stayed in a little longer. An easy way to tell they are done when making them bigger is that they begin to crack. Let them crack a good bit, but keep an eye on them, they are easy to burn (I speak from experience)lol 
These guys are GREAT and a Hershey kiss is the perfect topper! Happy Holidays!!

I have a recipe my best friend uses that is very close but better. No egg only 3/4 cup of peanut butter. Then you bake at 325 for 4 or 5 minutes. It cooks way faster and without the egg they stay so soft I really couldn't believe it! With this change in the recipe you do need to leave them as rolled balls of dough or they will get too thin.

Sorry, didn't like these at all.  The taste is okay, it's the TEXTURE that I don't like.  They are TOO CHEWY!  I hate chewy cookies, I prefer nice and crisp!  Just my opinion.

These cookies got rave reviews in my family!!  Not at all sure how someone can find these too salty.  Anyways, really liked how quick these were to make and will definately use this recipe again.
