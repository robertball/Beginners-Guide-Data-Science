I really liked the tangy flavor this gave the pulled pork I made (Chef John's pork shoulder in paper recipe). It was a nice change from 'plain ole' BBQ sauce. Would definitely make and use again.

Minus the honey, this recipe is the true foundation of real eastern North Carolina BBQ sauce. I salute Chef John for adhering so closely to the genuine article. It's true that some places in Eastern NC add sugar and some don't, and some have additional spices added as well. One thing I have found is that this type of sauce seems best suited to the BBQ made in the same area, most places already sauce their chopped BBQ before it reaches your table and it is blended in already and doesn't taste as harsh to some people than when adding it at the table.

To get off the "West Coast Twist" and still have some sweetness just use granulated sugar. I use brown sugar and next time I'm adding molasses made in NC. It's also helpful to gently simmer the vinegar as you whisk in the ingredients so the salt and sugar dissolve better. It will stink a little in your kitchen (the simmering vinegar) but you will get a better result.

Absolutely awesome on any pulled smoked meats! I've also used it to baste a pork loin that I smoked. If you start basting from the beginning of the smoke (unlike thick sauces, at the end)

Made according to recipe. It was okay but disappointed as thought it would be fantastic as I like the other Chef John's recipes I have tried. Tried this on the Paper Pulled Pork recipe but preferred my regular BBQ sauce Sweet Baby Rays. Will try some of the other BBQ recipes I have added to favorites.
