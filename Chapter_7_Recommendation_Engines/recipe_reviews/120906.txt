You can cut a lot of time out of this by substituting the sauce portion of the recipe for cucumber ranch dressing. That is what I did and it tasted fantastic! The flavor of the beef was wonderful. I had it marinade for a couple hours then I cooked it on the stovetop. I cooked it with the onions that were in the marinade so they were slightly cooked instead of raw...personal preference. This will become a staple at our house I'm sure. My husband loved them! They had a perfect amount of heat factor but since he likes to sweat...I will probably add a little more next time!

LOVED IT!!  My husband and son couldn't eat this fast enough!!  I am somewhat lazy, so I used the roast beef at the deli idea and the cucumber ranch dressing, but it was so good!!  I think I might cut down on the soy sauce a little next time I make it and that will definitely be soon!  The meat is even better the next day.  Try this.

I agree with the other person, these recipe needs to be re-formulated. It doesn't define which garlic cloves go where, your left to guess where they are meant to go. WAY to much soy sauce, I only used 1/4 cup. The cider vingear is to harsh for the cucumber sauce and instead of a nice cool taste it was harsh and garlicly. I blame the garlicly taste on me though since I guessed that the 4 cloves went into the cucumber sauce instead of the marinade. The marinade was the only redeeming factor in these whole mess. I suggested useing the meat and marinade part and finding a different cucumber sauce.

My husband and I have been looking for a gyro recipe for a long time, and this was a huge hit!  All of our five kids loved the meat, and everyone left the table stuffed.  I followed the marinade recipe exactly as written and we thought it was absolutely sensational...we did not notice any overwhelming soy flavor and we loved the garlic.  Excellent recipe!!!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I didn't use this cucumber sauce go to:  Chicken Souvlaki Gyro Style, this recipe on this site has the best Tzatziki (Cucumber Sauce.  Other reviewers are not giving this recipe justice - it is VERY good!  Thanks!

I thought these were very good!! However this recipe makes so MUCH cucumber sauce. I am not sure what I am going to do with it. Can you freeze it? I will make again but probably cut the cumcumber sauce in 1/3.

Great recipe.  We will definitely be using this one again.  We use moose steak instead of beef because we have a freezer full of game.  I also use regular white vinegar because it is what is in the cupboard.  For the cucumber sauce, I have used an english cucumber with seeds and peel or a regular peeled cucumber  with seeds and all included.  I found no reason to remove the seeds from the cucumber, though the peel did make the sauce slightly greenish.  Also, the cucumber sauce is much better with just one clove of garlic.  This allows the cucumber flavor to really stand out.  Otherwise followed the recipe and LOVED this!!

This recipe was very easy.  My husband made it!!  The meat turned out so tender!  We only made one adjustment instead of soy sauce we used worchestershire.  Also it was a bit spicy for the kids so next time I think we will cut the ginger and cayenne pepper in half.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I used the marinade only, without modification.  The meat was broiled for six minutes one side, four the other.  I cut it into strips, tasted one, and thought "blech!"  I had used CAYCE's 'Tzatziki I' recipe (adding a little garlic powder at the end, and following Jennifer's advice on draining), which I tasted after and thought "blech!"  I was feeling sorry for myself that I would have to eat all this, but I put the meat, tomato, onion, and lettuce in a pita, took a bite, and thought "Hey! This works!"

It doesn't taste quite like a gyro, but it is pretty decent nonetheless.

Also, slice the pita onion very thin, and make sure it is only quarter-rounds. Half-rounds work their way out of the pita.

Meat excellent.  I only marinated it for 1 hour and it turned out very tasty.  I don't much care for the cucumber sauce though.  Looking for another recipe for that.

Easy to make and the taste is awesome!!!  I made the marinade ahead of time and let the meat sit over night.  I grilled the meat on a counter top grill and the taste is AMAZING!!  My husband couldn't keep his hands off until dinner!  We used a different cumcumber garlic sauce so I can't judge that portion of the recipe, but the meat portion was so good!  We couldn't find sirlion tip roast so we used sirlion steaks cut up as the recipe calls for.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!

This recipe comes together nicely in 40 minutes if you skip the marinate step. The cucumber sauce was very yummy, and the recommended fixings work very well. However, I'm knocking my review down to four stars because said marinate step isn't expressed in the "Ready In" time and because several steps are irritatingly batched together. Otherwise, this recipe is terrific!

This recipe is excellent! We found it in Taste of Home years ago and make it often. Yes, There is a lot of garlic in the sauce, but the sauce makes a lot. I cut the sauce in half or even to a 1/4 and definitely lighten the vinegar. We love the sauce with all that garlic. My mom makes it to eat on salads and veggies, she likes it so much!

I used ground beef in place of sirloin tip. I omitted the water in the marinade for the meat. I browed the ground beef and drained the excess liquid. It was quite tasty!

For whatever reason I just wasn't impressed! Rather surprised as I thought for sure we'd like it. The only thing I did differently was to cut the cayenne down(kids). If we try it again I'd halve the soy sauce I think and use brown sugar.

Loved the flavor of the meat! I'm going to try soaking some steaks in this without slicing them up for gyros and see how that works.

the marinade was great. I agree with Katekin about the cucumber sauce. Not much of a "cucumber" taste but this can easily be adjusted. We still enjoyed the sauce. One star rating is a bit harsh. We enjoyed

Enjoyed it for dinner last night. The marinade is wonderful. Marinaded for about 3 hours and ended up cooking on stovetop. Great flavor. I used low salt soy sauce and the it was not missed. Did not use the cucumber sauce but bought one from Costco that was awesome. Looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Big hit with my family.  Bought some cheap steak and sliced them thin, marinaded for few hours..threw meat in a grill basket and cooked on the grill.  VERY tender.  Cucumber sauce cuts down on the spice and great flavor.  Would half the cucumber sauce recipe.  Seems disproportionate to the meat/pita amount.  Otherwise a definate do-over.  Wouldn't change anything except quantity.

I made this recipe last weekend and it came out great.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe called for was that I cut it into 1/4" pieces before I placed them in the bag to marinate and it sat in the frig for 2 days.  My family loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is fabulous and easy. My husband and I loved it with the cucumber dressing. My only advice is to pack the meat and sauce seperate from the pita for lunches the next day. Even my kids liked it and you couldn't have three harsher food critics than that! Thanks for this great recipe. It's now a regular favourite.

I randomly looked up this recipe tonight and was surprised that it turned out so good!  Instead of flank steak, I just used what I had on hand...thin piece of london broil.  I didn't have a lot of it, so I also used one boneless chicken breast.  I prepared the marinade as listed, except decreased soy sauce amount to 1/4 cup like one of the reviewers suggested.  I split the marinated into two bags, one for beef and one for chicken.  Marinated the meats for about 30 minutes (didn't have time to do 1 hour or more), but it still turned out good!  It's a little too cold to grill outside and I don't have the ability to grill indoors, so I just pan cooked it.  Still turned out super yummy!  I cheated with the cucumber tatziki sauce and just bought some from Costco (the inspiration for the meal in the first place).  I prefer the steak to the chicken, but both were good.  Hubby liked the chicken!

This meat was fantastic!  However, like so many others, changed a few things!  I only made a half recipe (cutting it from 8 servings to 4 servings)and I took all of the ingredients (for the meat) and put it in the slow cooker.  I used dijon mustard, instead of ground mustard.  Added an extra 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, as I love spicy food, and used 1/2 cup of water (total) as I didn't want it to dry up in the crockpot.  Cooked it on low for 7 hours - it was 'melt in your mouth' meat with amazing flavor!  Served it in pita pockets with diced tomatoes, cucumber, and cucumber ranch dressing (as recommended by other people).  Great recipe!  Definitely worth trying it in the crockpot...!

Turned out great!  I used chicken and beef, the chicken did come out a little salty, but I marinated it overnight so it would be ready to cook when I got home from work.  Had I marinated it as directed it might have been fine.  Either way it was still good and I'd make it again!  The sauce was a little too vinegary for our taste, I would reduce the vinegar next time.

Very delicious meal, but leaves a long aftertaste suspected cause being the large amount of garlic and onion. We added feta cheese and some salad spinach. We will probably use the cucumber ranch idea next time to cut down cooking time and garlic.

This was fantastic.  I made it camping, had everything made up at home and marinated the beef 2 days. I used a portion of a large roast I had cut in half.  5 people who have lots of different tastes, loved it (although a couple didn't use the sauce).  The left over meat was great warmed up the next day too.  I will be making this again and again.
UPDATE:  I made this again and everyone raved over the flavor of the meat.  Since it as really cold outside, I cooked it in a grill pan inside.  Warm up the pitas too.  I made the sauce with plain yogurt and it was still delish. Also, a 1/2 batch of the cucumber sauce is plenty unless you like leftovers.  You have to try this, it's fantastic.  The marinade would be good for shish kabobs with pineapple too.

This recipe was pretty good.  However, it did not take very authentic Greek gyro to me.  My kids did really like it because it had more of a sweet mild flavor that what we have made in the past.  To me, it tasted more along the lines of a good fajita meat recipe.  We did not grill it so maybe that was the difference.  We pan fried it. I will use the recipe again, but probably not the "gyro" expectations.  thanks for the recipe!

The sauce portion of this reciepe was GREAT! That is why I am giving it 3 stars. However the meat portion needs to be reviewed and made better.

This recipe was not at all what i expected,the meat marinade tasted way to much like soy sauce..it was definetly overpowering, as well as the garlic. And the cucumber sauce, to much garlic and vinegar, and you definetly don't need to make as much as the recipe calls for, you could make about 1/4 of the recipe, as it made about 4 cups worth of sauce.Won't use again.:(

The sauce was excellent. Very garlicky but the meat was not what I look for in gyros at all. It wasn't bad, it just didn't seem authentic.

Really good recipe. I added some dill to the cucumber sauce, and some cavendars seasoning to the beef. I will definately use again!
