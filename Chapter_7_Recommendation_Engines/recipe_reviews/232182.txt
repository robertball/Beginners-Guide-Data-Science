Love the recipe as is, cooked per time listed. For me that's saying something. Being from Tennessee,if green beans haven't cooked for at least 2 hours then they are not done. Such a quick and easy way to get your vegetables. 

And like everyone else I put my spin on it the second time around. I added a can of shoe-peg corn, a chopped onion, some chicken stock, and sliced almonds. Yum!Yum! The third time I made it using vegetable stock(preferred the chicken stock) I had cooked boneless pork ribs(no barbecue sauce)to go with it. When I went to reheat it the next day, I shredded the pork and added it to the pot. Another Yummer! Next time I try it for myself I'm going to use 1 can of green beans and 1 can of black beans or maybe just use 2 cans of the black beans for a Mexican flavor. (I'm fixing it for the family dinner at my sister's this week.) Thanks so much for this recipe Lori!!!!

A great way to prepare green beans with the added zip of red pepper and tomatoes. My husband loves green beans and this is a 5 star recipe. I added the recipe to my list of Keepers. I used petite canned tomatoes and added a bit of parsley.

I haven't tried, but I bet this would be fantastic with fresh veggies too!  I might try zucchini instead of the green beans.

Hot & Spicy Green Beans w/ Tomato Haiku: "This was just okay. Only swap was frozen beans, did the rest the same." Good but not extraordinary; we ate it alongside London broil and mashed potatoes, but agreed that we prefer AR's "Green Beans w/ Cherry Tomatoes."
