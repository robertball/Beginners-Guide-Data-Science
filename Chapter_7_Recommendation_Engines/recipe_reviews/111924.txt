Ohhhhh my...I am so happy to be one of the lucky few who chose to make these muffins as Jan (the submitter) intended, and refrained from any modifications, especially adding all kinds of distracting spices. I agree with Mollytina and her review completely that the wonderful apple flavor just shines through! And the bit of cinnamon in the  topping is just the right amount to complement the apples. (No wonder Jan calls these Apple Pie Muffins!)  If I had added all that cinnamon and other spices that others thought it was necessary to do, I would have never known what I was missing!  These muffins are refreshingly delicious. The recipe stands, in my book, with no corrections necessary and will become a favorite I'll go back to often. Thanks for your wonderful recipe Jan!

Wow, these are awesome! It's like eating apple pie in a muffin! What a perfect name for these moist, delicious, nicely spiced treats. No need for any additional spices, the apple flavor really is the hero here. I wouldn't change a thing! I baked these in Texas sized muffin tins and got a little over half a dozen, lucky me!

Amazing muffins. If you are looking for a decadent muffin to serve guests, or just as a special treat, you really should try this recipe. I made these exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The crumb topping is so out of this world that the muffin itself does not need any added spices. The two were a perfect balance for each other. Moist, flavorful. Grease your muffin tins very well and fill the cups to the top as directed, and you will obtain gorgeous, huge muffin tops that hold all of that spectacular crumb topping. It took a few minutes of careful excavation to remove them from the pan with the tops intact, but letting them cool for about 10 minutes helped.

My daughter entered these for her first year of 4-H foods and won Reserve Champion!!  She added 3 cups of apples, 1 1/2 t cinnamon & 1 t nutmeg to the batter and 1 t cinnamon and 2 dashes nutmeg to the topping.  She made several batches as they were easy to make and she never had any leftover.  Everyone loved these!!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I thought it could use a little more cinnamon taste to the batter, so that next time I mixed a little sugar and cinnamon and tossed the apples in this and then added them to the batter.  I made these for a fund raiser at work and they got rave reviews.  I am anxious to try the recipe with blueberries.

I thought that these were great.  I didn't read the reviews before making them so I didn't add any extra spices to the batter.  They were ok coming out of the oven but the next day they were super good and moist.  Also, you only need to make half the topping cause even after I generously topped my 15 muffins, I still had lots left over!

These were good, but not great.  It has a lot of sugar in it.  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the mixture, and then 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the topping.  I used Granny Smith apples - 2 heaping diced cups worth, and still did not have much apple flavor.  My husband liked them, but again, too sweet and little apple flavor for me.  I have had apple cake before from Tastefully Simple, and that is what it reminded me of.  High rating is from husband.

Very good. Everyone LOVED them. Definitely will be making these more often. I used chiquita to go apples and chopped them up instead of peeling whole apples, saved time and was easy to measure amount.

Excellent! I couldn't find my muffin pans (mysteriously disappeared) so I made this into an apple Pie (more like crisp) cake. Put the batter in the 9 X13 ban and made a double batch of topping. I chopped the apples into about 1/2 inch size pieces. Super moist and good. Even better the next day!   I made everything exactly as stated, except the muffin part.

These muffins were better than I expected. They looked and tasted proffessional and not homemade. Can't wait to make them again. This recipe is a keeper.

These were Good!  The recipe really does not need any change(s).  The taste is nice, the texture is not dense ... just right. I used cupcake liners and the muffins were rather well-behaved and didnt really stick to the paper! THANKS!

Good muffins...I used milk with a tablespoon of vinegar in place of the buttermilk since I didn't have any buttermilk.

I get major compliments on these muffins whenever I make them. I think I use more apples than it calls for. This last time I had almost a whole bag that was going bad and chopped them up in the food processor and threw them all in there. So good!!

We used this recipe to make muffins with the daycare children after an apple picking field trip.  Although all of the adults loved them, most of the children didn't.  The changes I made were substituting 1/2 apple sauce with butter and 1/2 whole wheat flour with white. We also added  cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and all spice.

I haven't tasted these because I was baking them as a gift but if the way they look is any indication, and I think it is,  they will be a big hit! They smelled fabulous, rose beautifully, and looked amazing. Honestly, my baking skills are minimal and these made me look like a pro! I'll review them again after the recipients give their opinion. I never take this kind of baking leap of faith but I'm betting this was a darn good first time! :o)
Update~ These were worth the leap! WOOT! :o)

Absolutely great tasting muffins! However, I wouldn't recommend filling them to the top before baking. I did for one batch and they spilled over and the tops were very flat and burnt. I would also recommend breaking up the streusel with your fingertips and placing the streusel around the edges of the muffin top. In my first batch I haphazardly placed it all over the muffin and several of the muffins collapsed in the center. Nonetheless, I would try this recipe again! The muffins had fabulous flavors and I loved the apple chunks!

Yum! These are very good as is. I wouldn't add cinammon to the batter because there is sooo much in the topping already. It does make a generous portion of topping, but I used nearly all of it. Each muffin's top was completeley covered by the struesel and it was great that way. It reminded me of a Dutch Apple pie with the crumb topping.  The only thing I would change mext time is to use one tart apple (granny smith) and one sweet. I used two sweet apples (junami) and wished I hadn't because the contrast would have been nice, and more true to the apple pie flavor. Regardless, these were delicious and perfectly moist as the recipe is written.

Yep, these were fantastic. I made them as written after reading several reviewers' urging to do so! Maybe a 1/4 c or so of extra apples. The muffin tin was well-greased but I had trouble getting them out. I think paper liners are the way to go when there's a streusel involved.

These should be called "Better Than Apple Pie" muffins because I think I would rather eat one of these than apple pie.  They are delicious exactly as written.  Don't tweak, don't change, just make them.

These muffins are definitely better the second day! I grated the apples just because it's faster & substituted applesauce for half of the butter. I decided not to add cinnamon so I could judge the recipe fairly, but next time I'll add it for sure! As for the topping, I tried it as the recipe stated, but next time I'll use the traditional method of mixing in cold butter with a pastry cutter instead since the melted butter caused a gooey mess that didn't spread well! These cooked for exactly 25 minutes and smelled wonderful! FYI: This recipe made 15 muffins for me and I filled every one to the top! Awesome :o)

Delicious!!!! Everyone at the potluck I took these to loved them. I made as the recipe states,only adding just a bit more apple, but no additional spices, and am glad I did. I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full and got 18 perfectly shaped muffins. There seemed to be too much topping, but I squeezed it all on and it was my favorite part. I used some super flavorful jonamac apples from the orchard and I loved them in this. Because apple is the dominant flavor in these it is important to use great quality apples. I actually liked these better the second day. Thanks!.......ok. I have made these three times, and the last time my apples were not that tasty so I did add a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter. They were terrific and everyone else seemed to like them much more. I have found that heating the muffin slightly in the microwave and serving it with Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream and the buttermilk syrup (which is actually a caramel syrup) from this site is to die for. My boyfriend and parents love it. Everyone said it is better than Apple pie. I will continue to make these and serve them that way - but not too often because I cannot stay away from these, and I usually have no problem in that area. These are just too too yummy. I even forgot to add the brown sugar to the batter and realized my mistake before I baked them, so I stirred it in at the end thinking they would be tough,  but they were as tender as ever. These are my favorite muffins now (and I make a LOT of muff

While my muffins won't showcase a perfectly-domed top like a bakery-perfect muffin, the flavor makes up for any visual "imperfections" this little nugget of deliciousness may have! I couldn't decided if I wanted to putz around with a recipe (cuz you know how hard it is to peel and dice apples...right... such laziness!), but I'm so glad I did and I really enjoyed making this recipe and look forward to sharing with my coworkers! Even the extra time spent making (almost) perfectly even dices of the apples! This recipe really needs to tinkering, though I've been tempted to do a light powdered sugar drizzle to pretty it up, but I don't want to mess with perfection. :) I'm even thinking I'll skip the usual Tupperware and take them on a cake pedestal!!

These muffins were pretty good, but everyone was right about adding more cinnamon to the batter before baking. I should have read the comments first! The strusel-like topping made the tops delicious, but you don't need as much as it calls for. Overall, add some cinnamon/nutmeg and you'll be good to go!

I made these as directed and found the topping added too much sweetness. I will probably make again without the topping and will add cinnamon in the batter.

Oh wow, these are fantastic! I followed th recipe exactly and they are amazing. No need for any changes. I used a little over 1 1/2 large Granny smith apples and that was plenty (about two cups). The topping is very sweet so you don't have to go too heavy on it. Just as good, and maybe even better, the next day. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

These were so good!  My kids loved them.  The topping is excellent.  I made them exactly as the recipe stated.  I don't like huge chunks of fruit in my food, so I diced my apples really small.  The muffins were moist and full of flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Perfect, made no changes. Not overly sweet The topping makes more than twice what you need, so you can cut that by 1/2 and still have more than enough.

delicious! DH  and my little ones loved it.  I was out of buttermilk so i used whole milk and it turned out fine. i also added a little bit of pumkin pie spice to the batter. I feel there is too much apples in the mix, next time i will add a little less. thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Made this without the topping and they were very good.  Seemed a little heavy on the brown sugar so next time I'll try 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.

Wonderful taste and aroma.  Did not add cinnamon to the batter and the delicate apple-vanilla flavor is an excellent counterpoint to the cinnamon crumb topping.  I did cut the butter to 1/3 cup just on general principles, and they were still tender, but not greasy.  A lovely recipe and I will make them again.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! I took what other people said and kind of ran with it. Instead of chopping and cubing the apples, I grated them with a cheese grater (I peeled them first). It gives you much better distribution. I also used 3 cups of grated apple instead of 2 (about 3-4 apples). I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and nutmeg to the crisp topping. A little bit of nutmeg will go a very long way! I also used an extra TBSP of melted butter for the topping. I don't know why this recipe says it makes only 12 because I made 24, and that was filling them to the top... It's been requested that I make these again tomorrow!

These were so easy to make.  A Sunday afternoon is perfect time to make these.  I did substitute 1/2 cup of white sugar for the 1 and 1/2 cup of  brown sugar.  Might want to cook at 370 for the same amount of cook time though.  They did come out quit brown.  FYI, my cooking tins made 17 muffins.  They were smaller than 1 cup.  This recipe is outstanding, I will be making this again and AGAIN!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did not find that spices were needed in the muffin mixture itself.  The batter had a good flavor on its own if you use solid tasting apples.  One change to the recipe I made was not using melted butter in the streusel topping.  I just used cold butter and created a meal like topping which did not collapse into the muffin as happened with my first attempt at these muffins.

I followed this recipe top the tee and feel it has wonderful potential. However, it definately needs more spices as it leaned towards the bland side. Also it baked in about 20 minutes rather than the 25 listed.

These were just ok. I used Granny Smith apples, but not much apple flavor. Probably won't make again.

I hate to give anything a bad rating, but these were really disappointing. I read and reread the recipe, and then read some reviews to see if anyone mentioned the absence of baking powder, but no one did, so I went ahead and tried them. I used extra spices and cut down on the sugar as some had suggested.  I was even very careful in mixing so as to not overmix. Well these didn't  hardly rise at all, they were very dense and almost gluey in consistency. From now on I will stick to my basic tried and true muffin recipe.

In a word, wow!  Moist, tender, and lightly sweet, with delightful notes of apple and cinnamon.  I subbed sucralose (Splenda) for 1/3 of the sugar in the muffins themselves.  I will definitely make these again.

I thought these had a pretty good taste. I like the pieces of apple throughout. The recipe said to fill the muffin cups to the top. I don't normally do that, but I followed the recipe exactly. I got 11 instead of 12 filling them as suggested. And, it caused a few of the muffin tops to break off on the larger ones. If I make again I will leave a small space 1/8"-1/4" on top. However, other than that they were tasty. And, they actually did remind me of a muffin version of an apple pie when I got past the crumble top. Super moist muffins!

I made these without the crumb topping and they were still absolutely delicious.  They are super-easy to make and the batter quantity is sufficient to fill 12 muffin cups all the way to the top for large, moist muffins!

Love these! I used half the brown sugar in the muffin because I tend to find things sweeter than most, used regular skim milk since buttermilk is not available overseas (or have yet to see it) also added some cinnamon, and it was perfect.
Thank you for sharing.

I followed recipe as written and ended up with a mess. Muffins did not rise, just spilled over top of pan and the topping baked on the pan making it impossible to get muffins out in one piece.  I ended up with chunks. Irritating waste of ingredients and time.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I remember enjoying these once at a dearly departed friend's home.  She made them in individual bundt pans.  Always sorry I didn't get the recipe from her.  Now I have it!   Thank You, Jan Brown!!

Amazing, true apple pie flavor. Definitely looks like a bakery's. It makes a very sweet muffin, so unless you love super sweet things for breakfast, eat it as dessert. Also, it makes a lot of streusel, so use a little less ingredients so you won't waste any.  Changes made: We mixed the apples with cinnamon and added a good bit of cinnamon to the dry mix.

Great bendable recipe that I could change up to make healthier for our family. I used whole wheat white flour, added a teaspoon of baking powder, cut the butter back by half and used homemade applesauce and I used only half the sugar called for. Using applesauce, the extra sugar wasn't even missed. Next time, I might try an oat topping on the top for a Dutch Apple Pie kind of taste.

These were very good muffins. My son wanted "apple pie muffins" and voila! I found these. For a healthier muffin, I used 1 cup whole wheat & 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour. Although they really did have an apple pie-ness to them, they were too sweet. When My son asks for these again, I think I'll cut the brown sugar in half, but definitely still put the topping. One other minor change I made was to grate the apples (skin on) n a food pro instead of chopping them. Beside that, I made them as the initial poster wrote. I had to bake them an additional 12 minutes to have them be fully cooked. Nice way to use up apples that need eaten! Good dessert muffins.

Thanks for posting this recipe.

Yum!  I've made these both with and without the streusel (sprinkled sugar on top of the bare ones) and it was delicious both ways.  Also, one time I went a little overboard on the apples and it was more like 3 cups, and that was pleasant.... although they're excellent just as is.  Thank you!

This recipe is great! Like the other reviewers, I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter, as well as the steusel topping. Another alteration I made was using oil in the batter instead of butter. They turned out tasting great, the name says it all!

These muffins are amazing.  I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter after adding the apples to spice it up a bit more.

DELISH!! I followed the recipe as it was written except I used muffin liners instead of just baking them directly in the muffin pans. I somehow ended up with enough batter for 15 instead of 12 so I put the remaining batter into well oiled muffin pans as directed. The results were surprising because the ones in the muffin liners did not puff up nearly as well as the ones in the pans HOWEVER the ones in the pans got very burned around the edges from the streusel topping and make my whole kitchen smell like burned sugar. A taste test resulted in 5 very solid stars for the ones in the muffin liners and maybe 4.5 stars for the ones in the pans because they taste like when you burned the marshmallow for your s’mores - not a terrible flavor but I don’t care for it. So there you have it, if you’re going for height and looks, be gentle with the streusel topping and be sure not to use muffin liners! All in all, a delicious muffin recipe that did not require any additional spices or modifications. I will definitely be making them again!!

Mine didn't turn out well.  I would recommend not filling them to the top of the muffin tin, as the recipe says - they ran over and didn't raise well, so they were difficult to get out of the muffin tins.  They tasted good, but I have better recipes to use for this type of muffin.

Way too sweet for my taste!  So much sugar means you can't taste the apple or cinnamon just sweet.  Nice idea though so I will tweak for my family.

Great recipe! The apples are very moist in this muffin. Everyone liked them. Added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix (in addition to the amount it calls for in the topping).

Very flavorful muffins! Added a tbsp of cinnamon to the batter. Only complaint is that there is way too much batter for only one 12 slot tray. Next time I'll fill them 3/4 full and use two trays.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used sour cream, and also used 2 large empire apples (about 2.5 cups). They were delicious. Like other reviewers had said, the flavor of the plain muffin isn't all that strong... next time I will add cinnamon or nutmeg to the apples as others mentioned. I made mini muffins and had approx. 4 dozen out of one batch. More like an apple streusel, not pie, but still great. Will definitely make these again!

Delicious. Didn't change a thing, except I doubled the recipe and made 18 jumbo muffins :) The only thing I might try in the future is making a more substantial streusel topping with bigger "chunks."

Didn't try the muffin recipe, but the topping was delicious! I added it to some store bought high fiber apple muffins that no one in my family would eat, and suddenly everyone wanted a muffin!...and got some extra fiber :)

These were just SO good! I made them in a large muffin pan without liners and filled them 3/4 full. I got six beautiful muffins that were absolutely delicious. They were even better the next day when I took them to work for friends. Definitely a keeper!

I decided to make this into a coffee cake instead of muffins and I am writing this review to tell you what not to do, lol!  First I guessed a 9” springform pan would work and it did.  It yielded a nice high coffee cake.  However, my error came when I didn’t turn the oven temp back.  At 375 degrees the crumb topping was browning faster than the center of the cake was getting done.  So, consequently I had to remove it from the oven before it was completed baked in the center.  My result was a soggy middle, so next time I will lower the oven temp to 350 and maybe cover the top with foil if it appears to be browning too fast.  The good news is, this was delicious!  And a def make again!

I made this recipe as written. They were delicious! The only suggestion I would make is to use tart apples such as Jonathans. I couldn't find them at the store so I just grabbed gala apples. I felt like they kind of got lost in the sweet batter. Tart apple would really pop.

Great taste. Didn't modify ingredients at all, followed directions including 'filling muffin tins to top' but this was a huge mistake.  Muffins didn't crown, spread flat across top of pan and streusel stuck to pan so removing muffins (even with paper liners) was a mess. They were not pretty.  Had enough batter for another 4 muffins so made those muffins only filling 3/4, baked for about 20 min, they turned out perfect.  Perfect crown, looked beautiful and tasted great.

These were simple to make.  I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture.  I also put the apples in the flour mixture and coated them before adding the sugar mixture, in hopes they would not sink to the bottom.  I have not tried these, but they smelled delicious while cooking.  Mine only took 15 minutes in the oven, so I would check on them periodically.  If you fill the tin to the top with batter you will get overflow.  My muffing tops ran into each other, which was OK but made it harder to get out of the tins.  The crumble on top disappeared into the batter and was not the presentation I had hoped for.

Two words.  Absolutely perfect.  -  This recipes needs NO tweaking at all.  The only thing I did different was to mix 1 Tbsp.  lemon juice with the 1Cup of milk, only because I had no buttermilk.  I made 24 mini muffins for my son's class party and I don't want to give them up!

I coat the apples with 1-2 tsp cinnamon sugar mixture and about 1 T flour before I add them to the batter. For the crumb topping I use 3/4 c sugar, 3/4 cup flour, 1 T water, 1 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 c butter.

Quite possibly the best apple recipe EVER! Even if you don't care for apples as much as other fruits, you have to try these! I did run out of flour, so I used about 3/4 cup of wheat flour and I think I would do the same thing next time. Very good!

I was so disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were flat, greasy and no apple taste at all.  I was also very surprised that there was no baking powder in these.

OMGoodness.Are these ever delicious! I am so glad that we "tried" this recipe. I will def. be making these again. It is like eating a piece of moist apple pie. These muffins are super moist. And super yummy. I give them a 15 on a 1-10 scale.

These are really good. I followed the recipe and did not change a thing. The only thing I changed was I used dark brown sugar for the crumb topping, only because I ran out of light brown sugar. They turned out really really sweet. I'm glad I didn't add additional spices either, the way they are is sweet and tasty enough. I will use light brown sugar for the topping next time.

I did a fairly fine dicing of the apples which helped to spread them throughout the batgter.  These are easy to make and my 8 year old grandson proclaimed them as his "new" favorite muffin!  The cinnamon brown sugar topping was the clincher.  The aroma wafting through my house was mouth-watering!  Thank you so much!!

These were very good and moist!  I agree with other reviews that the batter needs some cinnamon.  The topping is awesome!  Watch your bake time-mine only took about 20 minutes but I know every oven is different.  Will make again!

Yum!! I can't stop eating them. I used Haralson apples from one of our trees. I got 22 regular sized muffins so I think the serving size is off or the are meant to be 12 jumbo muffins. The odd thing is one pan rose beautifully the other pan was flat. Not sure what happened there. I did add a bit of oats to the streusel. Thanks

These were great! I had extra batter left after my 12 muffins so I made mini muffins with the extra and they (the minis) didn't last 10 minutes after they were cool enough to eat. The big ones we saved for breakfast the next day and it was the best Sunday breakfast ever! Thanks for sharing!

EXCELLENT!  My first bite was like a slice of apple pie:)  Followed recipe as is except I didn't pack the brown sugar.  Tasted great right out of the oven.  Definitely a keeper in my special recipe book.

I used ww flour for the ap, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, halved the brown sugar and halved the melted butter. I skipped the topping and just sprinkled tops with cinnamon sugar, mine baked at 350 in 20 minutes. Muffins were nicely domed, had great flavour and soft crumb, really nice and tasty!

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used half plain yogourt and half milk. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The topping was a bit too much, but I still used it all up by pressing it and jamming all on the tops of the uncooked muffins. I got 6 jumbo and 8 regular muffins out of one batch. They were really delicious! I loved the texture, and were even better a few days later! They didn't taste like apple pie though, they just tasted like really good  appple muffins! Yum, awesome apple muffin recipe. Thank you so much for sharing :)

Really enjoyed these muffins.  Instead of 1/2 c. butter, I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. applesauce.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Very moist and tasty.

Flavor was good, I made 13 muffins since I had too much batter for 12, but I still had a mess.  The tops flowed over the sides when baked and I had a difficult time getting them out of the pan intact.  I live at a high altitude which may account for them rising too high.  If I were to make them again, I would make 1 1/2 dozen with the batter and I would use muffin papers in the pan.

My family's new favorite! So easy and so delicious...the hardest part was dicing the apples.  The crumb topping gave it this crunch that made the muffins just out of this world! I followed the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I did differently was halve the toppping because I already could see it would be too much for my family's liking. Used one granny smith apple and one fuji apple. Will make again and again!

I made these for my husband....he gives them two thumbs up! I made a separate mixture of 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and used this to coat the apples before I poured them into the batter.

These muffins were great!  I did follow others advice and add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I would also add another cup of apples and make sure they are cut into very small pieces.  22 minutes was perfect in my oven.  Kids loved them :)

Amazing! I made it in a 9x13 cake pan instead of doing muffins and just cooked it a bit longer until the middle was set. I also used oil in the batter because I had run out of butter. And shortening in the crumble on top.

Unbelievable.  This is the first review I've written because these are WAY worth it.  Of course, there is nothing healthy about these except the cut up apples...oh well.  I didn't have to use buttermilk substitute (milk and vinegar) and some margarine with butter but they were still amazing!

Tasty! Used Gala and Granny Smith apples. Grated them.  Also used vinegar in 2% milk as I did not have buttermilk.  I found the topping was not enough, so made 2 batches of that.  Wonderful... and bet they will be even better tomorrow as the apple taste melts in!

With modifications made... I didn't have buttermilk so I used a cup of sour cream, half cup apple sauce and a splash of milk.  Also added nutmeg and cinnamon as recommended by other reviewers.

These are awesome!  I completely agree with the reviewer who said that no extra spices are necessary - this recipe is wonderful as is.  They're especially delicious right out of the oven but are good even leftover.  The only advice I would offer is how many they make - I rather overfilled standard-sized muffin cups and ended up with 15.  The benefit to this was that the tops flattened out and held the crumb topping very well.  Thanks for sharing, Jan, this one is a definite keeper!

These are a big hit in my shop. Customers marvel at how they taste like a smashed an apple pie into a muffin! Wouldn't change a thing with this one and will make them again and again.

These are DEE-EEE-LICIOUS. Plenty of little apple chunks in every bite - and the streusel on top makes them just heavenly. The batter may seem stiff when you put them in, but they turn out nice and moist and fluffy, no worries. I added chopped pecans to the streusel for a nutty crunch. Used Pippin apples - they were the BEST! Just the right combination of tart and sweet, and held their shape in the muffins. I have never tasted a better apple cinnamon muffin!

I made these this weekend and they are awesome!  I added the apple pie spice that I had at home instead of just plain cinnamon and it added a little something.  I also added more apples then the recipes called out for.  Can't wait to make them again!

I forgot how much I like these!  I did add the extra cinnamon, some nutmeg and some allspice.  I also substituted applesauce for 1/2 the butter.

These are wonderful.  Do not change a thing.  I have been baking them at least twice a week for my boyfriend!!  I started using Splenda brown sugar for a few fewer calories and they are still great!  Love them!  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Was too lazy to make the topping so added the cinnamon to the batter and then just sprinkled some cane sugar on top.  Everyone loved them.

I usually do not like fruit in things but these are an exception! I used gala apples and they were really delicious. The best part if the crumb mixture on top. My batter made fifteen muffins. Very gooddddd!

These were soooo good the first time around, I did them again. This time I used whole wheat flour, applesauce and flaxseed meal as the butter, and added caramel bits in the batter.

Mind numbingly scrumptious.

Thank you!

Sooooooo Good! We went through the first batch in about two days, and it's only my husband, my one year old, and myself. Even my picky son likes them.  I had to bake a second batch for my husband to take to work. I took the advice of others and added 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter, and it came out great! This is a must try!

These are really good tasting muffins. Perhaps it's something European, but I did put a teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter too and it was great!My children loved it. They said that it tasted like a cookie we bake over here during the Holidays (Santa Claus).Especially the crumble topping was very nice. Thank you for this great recipe and greetins from Europe!

Kids loved it.  Used what I had on hand, 1 apple & 1 banana & made the brown sugar -  1 cup white sugar to 2 tablespoons molasses.  Also added cinnamon & nutmeg.

This recipe will give you a very moist, sweet and tender muffin. I made two batches because the first batch, made as per the recipe turned out too sweet for our tastes. The second batch, I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1t cinnamon and 1t allspice to batter, and baked in a mini muffin pan for 13 minutes. I added toasted chopped walnuts in the topping because we enjoy texture. Delicious no matter what!

These muffins were amazing. They are definitely a treat muffin, and not an everyday muffin as they have a lot of sugar in them. Daughter and husband loved them, though I will try grating the apple next time as my two year old picked out the bits of apple. added 1 tsp cinnimon to the batter. Excellent

yum yum yum i loved these.  i put in some cinnamon and nutmeg but otherwise left it the same.  they are tough to get out of the muffin pan, but i didn't use paper liners, and they were still warm when i was removing them, so maybe that's why.  also, if you prefer you probably don't need the full amount  of brown sugar.  they were sweet.  but i like sweet =)

Very good. I might try a little more cinnamon or nutmeg next time but they are very good the way they are. Perhaps this recipe was intended as jumbo muffins because I ended up with 23 regular muffins.

if I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I had enough to make 12 muffins & bread. When I saw I filled my 12 ct muffin tray, I thought what else can I bake this in, Grabbed my loaf pan and baked it for 40 minutes and before the end of the night the bread was GONE. I also drizzled a glaze over both the muffins and the bread (vanilla, conf sugar & milk). so so good.

I bake these whenever I want to make a BIG impression!  My version calls for 3 cups of apples instead of 2, and I sprinkle the bottom of each baking cup with a pinch of white sugar before filling them.  I usually have to double the streusel recipe to top 24 muffins.  they're a big hit!

I loved the taste but these are very messy as muffins. I now bake the recipe as a coffee cake. Put the batter in a 9x9 pan, top it with the streusel and bake for 40 minutes. I prefer it this way.

Soooo good! I always change my recipes a little bit... This time I substituted 1cup of the all purpose flour with almond flour/meal, added 1/4 cup flax seed meal, 1 cup stevia instead of 1 cup brown sugar, and lastly added 1 scoop protein powder. They turned out amazing and healthier :)

Very good - even my husband said it taste like apple pie.  All he needed was the ice cream.

I made these almost as written.  I decided that instead of using the crumble topping, I wanted to make these more like a cupcake and  top these with cream cheese frosting.  Since that would eliminate any cinnamon flavor, I did add a small amount of cinnamon to the batter.  I used 2 red delicious apples.  These were moist and delicious, and the cream cheese frosting complemented them very well.  They received rave reviews from my coworkers.

Absolutely scrumptious! Next time I think I'll add some nuts to the topping for a bit more crunch!

Very good. I was tempted to add cinnamon  to the batter but I'm glad I didn't. There is plenty of flavor in the topping and the flavor of the apples stand alone  just great. Family loved them. Will definitely make again.

The flavor is THE BEST! BUT, I always make in little muffin tins for the kids, without liners. Even spraying w pan, they all stuck and broke when pulled out. So next ti,e I will use paper liners or fill it 3/4. Also, note to self, fill the tins ALMOST to the top, don't let it overflow or it will puff up and brake like a mushroom cap. I got one full mini muffin tin plus 3 large muffins.

I decided to make these last minute and had to substitute but these are very good. I used half brown sugar and half coconut sugar. And I had no AP flour on hand and used 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat and 3/4 cup oat flour. I also shredded the apples and left them unpeeled. The coarser pieces were especially tasty so dicing would be better, I'm sure. I also added a teaspoon of King Arthur Apple pie spice to the batter, and I think it's needed for my tastes. Very moist, and they are getting better as they sit. I will make again.

Made them on this chilly autumn Sunday morning and my family really enjoyed them! The teenagers even put them on instagram. I did as others recommended and followed the recipe-not adding cinnamon as I usually do and was so glad I did. Really delicious .

Made these as written using (peeled apples and) a Wilton square muffin pan.  It made 10 large muffins.  They are very good and do get better the next day.  They were beautiful and very tasty.

Great muffins.  I got 18 regular muffins out of one batch.  I made them according to the recipe which I wouldn't change at all.  I liked that the muffin was more plain so the apple taste really shined.  The topping gave it the perfect amount of spice/flavor.  This is my go to apple recipe.

I wanted to add extra spices, but I decided to make the recipe as written since other reviewers recommended that.  I was glad I did when my husband enthusiastically stated, "This is how muffins are supposed to be!" The texture and flavor were great. I might add a little more apple next time, but they were good as they were.

I substituted the buttermilk to sour cream and microwaved that with a little vinegar and it turned out supper moist! Loved it SO yummy! I also made a glaze with maple syrup and powered sugar and poured over it after it baked! You won't be disappointed!:)

Muffins were dry, I took out of the oven at 20 mins and they were already over done..I would check at 15 mins and go light on the butter in topping if you want the crumble texture,

These were great! I cut out 2T of butter and added some apple pie yogurt to make a little more healthy. I did use 5 cups of apples. A mix of gala and granny smith. Shredded and chunked. Make sure you do have plenty of chunks. I'm assuming that since I added extra apples, mine were not pretty like the picture, but the extra apples were well worth ugly muffins. Great recipe...moist and gooey.

Yum!  FYI:  2 C. chopped apples was 1 large apple for me.  I did not peel the apple due to time and they were just fine.  Made 12 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins.  :-)  Very high sugar content though!  Definitely "Apple Pie"!  (1 C regular milk and 1 Tbs of vinegar, let sit 5 minutes for a buttermilk substitute.)

Best muffins ever.  However, you must follow the instructions.  Don't make substitutes for butter, type of flour, spices or buttermilk.  These were fluffy and moist...the only change I made was to halve the topping--that makes just enough for 12 muffins.

These muffins are back in my kitchen today by popular demand of all three of the kiddies! A perfect way to use the apples that are probably to ripe to eat, AS IS! I was out of buttermilk this time and used plain milk, and they were still very delicious. Permanent fixture in my recipe box-thank you!

Substituted oil for the butter and ground flax seed/water for the egg due to allergies and it was excellent!!  Gets better with each day- dense and moist, would be good with cinnamon in the batter if you wanted to sktip the streusel.

And I thought slicing apples for pie was fun!  :D  Two Grannies were two cups.  Didn't do the streusel topping so I could tell how much I liked the muffin compared to the topping.  Put spices (1t cinnamon, 1/4t each nutmeg, allspice, cloves) in the muffin.  Followed some of Sara Jo's suggestions & subbed 1c whole wheat & 1 1/4c white with 1t baking powder.  Also subbed lowfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  Used 1c sugar.  Really didn't taste like apple pie, more like apple cake?  Very cute looking & I got 18, not 12.  'Sure the streusel topping makes these much better, but I wasn't all that impressed with just the muffin part.  They did moisten up overnight, just no "Mmmm" moments.  :)

YES.  After a couple attempts at muffins that were absolutely horrible and a waste of time and money, I was THRILLED to find this recipe.  Truly spectacular.  I am vegan so I used soy milk (Silk plain) instead of buttermilk, Earth Balance instead of butter, and applesauce instead of the egg (standard substitutions) and these are just wonderful.  I agree with some others that a little cinnamon in the actual cake batter would be beneficial but I am so pleased.  These are almost like cupcakes.

Very yummy! I'd add more spice though, like some of the other readers have suggested. Extra cinnamon and some allspice are a nice touch.

DELICIOUS! I doubled the apples and add a teaspoon of cinnamon IN the batter mix and 2 in the topping, less sugar in batter mix (1  1/4 cups instead 1  1/2), milk instead of buttermilk and 20 minutes in 340 F (170 C).  They turned out just the way i wanted them! Everyone was so excited. Great recipe!

I didn't have the ingredients for my usual apple muffins so tried this recipe instead. Delicious! My husband has shredded the other recipe in favour of having me only make this one from now on! Highly recommended without changing a thing!

Not crazy about these.  I made them per the recipe except that I ran out of brown sugar so had to use half white and half brown in the topping.  I may try them again, using half white and half brown sugar in the batter, plus vanilla.

these are just right with wheat flour - the muffin ends up not too sweet, which balances out the sweetness of the streusel topping.

VEGETARIAN APPROVED - I've been on this site for over a year and have NEVER left a review. So, seeing as I'm compelled to leave one now, you know just how wonderful these muffins are! My ever so picky eater 8 year old loved these, as well as my hubby and finicky 2 year old. They ALL gobbled them up! One bite and hubby's head jerked in a way I'd never seen before with a resounding "MMMMMM" hahaha. I made them last night before bed and only have 4 left this morning. I have a feeling they'll be gone before the end of day. Since we are vegetarians I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the egg. I also didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 cup whole milk with 2.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I let that sit for 10 minutes to sour. Works as a great substitute when buttermilk is not handy. They still came out moistly fantastic! Otherwise I made the recipe EXACTLY as is! Will definitely make again.  (my daughter has already asked me to bake some for Valentine's Day).

These were excellent!  Made the recipe as written.  Used 2 cups of Honey Crisp Apples and cut into a very small dice.  Next time I may leave chunks a bit larger and I think that will enhance the apple flavor.  Family loved these muffins.  I am also going to try what one reviewer suggested and cut in cold butter for the topping and see what kind of results I get that way.

THIS MAKES THE BEST WAFFLES!!! With a few changes... First I didn't have buttermilk so I made some, 1 TBS lemon juice (or you can use vinegar) put in a liquid measuring cup. Fill to the 1 cup line with milk, let stand 5 minutes and Voi-la! Buttermilk. I added 2 TSP ground cinnamon into the batter. Also I nix the sugar cinnamon crumble topping and replace with oats. Place batter in waffle maker, top with oats, and cook on your favorite setting. the oat topping adds a nice crunch to contrast the moisture of the waffle and muffins. Warning these waffles are FILLING 1 apple cinnamon  waffle eats like 2 normal style waffles. With this recipe I was able to produce  2 large 1in.  pocket square waffles and 11 muffins. The batter goes A LONG WAY. Honestly I like it as waffles the most but the muffins are also delicious.

All I can say is Heavenly!. Do not change a thing. I hate it when people rate a recipe and 80% of it has been alterated with other ingredents or increase this or decrease that.
Perfect the way it is and goinjg into my recipe book.
Thanks for the recipe

I shredded the apples and made the apple a perfect consistency - very apple pie-ish  :)   They were a hit with everyone who tried them this weekend.  This is going to be a regular request in our family - delicious with a good cup of coffee!

I made these muffins this morning (Sunday) and I only changed one thing: instead of butter, I used applesauce. When I put the batter into the muffin tins, it kind of overflowed.... Oh well (: The sugar topping was more chunky than powdery for me, but probably because, again, I substituted the butter with applesauce. That was okay though, because they came out really well anyways.

Delicious! I've now made these twice and they just disappear. Instead of chopping the apples, I like to grate them. The only other change I made was to use oil instead of butter the second time I made them- they were incredibly light!

I had some honeycrisp apples I picked at the orchard that I needed to use up. These muffins were delicious. I didn't alter the recipe in any way, but like other reviewers, I was able to get close to 18 regular size muffins out of this recipe. I think they tasted best shortly after coming out of the oven. Could definitely treat as a breakfast or dessert. I would make these again.

Oh, these are good!!  Especially right out of the oven, or warmed up.  Definitely better when warm!!  I didn't fill all the way to the top, but I could have because they didn't rise very much, I'll try and make them bigger next time.  I only used 1C of the sugar, and I did half with the topping and half without, both are good.  This is my go-to apple muffin!!

This topping is what makes these muffins amazing-I didn't have any left over, I sprinkled my muffins very generously:) I'm glad I did! Next time however I will be grating apples instead of chopping them because my muffins started to fall apart the next day because of apple chunks. I think if you grate the apples it will improve overall texture of these amazing muffins!

DELICIOUS!!  I made these for a breakfast that I "catered"- they went like wild fire!  Very moist and delicious.  I used Fuiji applies.  I added cinnamon to the flour mixture before adding the buttermilk mixture.  The recipe says to fill the muffin cups to the top - I learned to fill them almost to the top.  It prevents them from running over and sticking to the pan.  Although my nieces and nephew enjoyed eating the "scraps" that stuck to the pan!  Will most definitely make these again.

These came out great! The only problem was, like other reviewers stated, they came out flat on top. I didn't have much trouble getting them out of the pans though. I filled the cups to the top, as directed. Next time, I'll try not filling them so full and see if that helps. I had enough batter for 15 muffins. My family loved them. I'm definitely going to make these again!

These muffins are so yummy!  The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.  I did add extra chopped apples, but next time I would just follow the amount recommened as that amount would be plenty.  Excellent topping.  Try these, and you shouldn't be disappointed.

These muffins are really good. I made them exactly as directed and I like them a lot. However, I have to say that I think the topping is completely unnecessary and only adds to the fat and calorie count, as well as the prep time. In fact, I made a few without the topping and actually like them better than the ones with. I also found that 25 minutes was too long in my oven -- 18-20 probably would be more like it. I will likely make these again, but without the topping. I might add a bit more apple and a tsp or so of cinnamon to the batter next time, since there won't be any topping. Thanks!

These muffins are fabulous, I took a batch to a Ladies group at church and everybody commented on how good they were. I made mine the day before and kept them in the fridge, they were still moist and delicious.

Oh my goodness--these are delicious!! I made the recipe exactly as directed---not a single alteration. I can't imagine why people tweak a recipe the first time they make it. Why not try it as the "chef" intended, especially when it is  baked goods? Oh well. These muffins filled the house with a heavenly aroma as they baked---it actually awakened my son! I think this recipe would also make a fabulous coffee cake.

Those muffins taste great. I made some changes to make them healthier and they turned up great: flour half whole wheat, half rye, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 c apple juice (instead of butter), 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c Splenda (instead of 1 1/2 brown sugar), added 1/2 c cinnamon chips (can't do without any chips!). Topping made only half the recipe with water instead of butter. Made a paste instead of crumbles but makes a sweet muffin top with less crumbs to pick up with kids. A keeper and great to use aging apples.

I loved these muffins.  They were so moist and tender.  I made some minor changes just to cut back on calories.  I used half butter/half applesauce in the batter and only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  I followed some of the reviews and only made half the topping.  I had plenty of topping for the 12 muffins and the sweetness was just right.  Delicious!

I made these per the directions with the exception that I used only 1 cup of brown sugar for the muffin batter.  I didn't measure my apples, just used 2 medium-sized Braeburns chopped up good.  These muffins were very delicious - very tender with a nice apple-y flavor.   I got 18 muffins from this recipe

These Apple Pie Muffins looked and sounded so good I had to try them, and they did not disappoint! They were fabulous. The recipe yielded 2 dozen and within one day the first dozen were gone! I froze the other dozen for a treat at a later date. I loved that the streusel made it a little crunchy on top and then you have the soft cake part and the delicious apples near the bottom. Awesome and thank you!!!

This was a great recipe! The only change I made was to the second batch. I filled the second batch as I normally would for a muffin or cupcake. The first batch when filled to the top over flowed and made a mess. These were a fantastic hit with the family. My oldest daughter ate 3! Thank you for sharing.

These are incredibly moist!  The only thing I did differently was add literally a shake of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  They produced a nice muffin top, something I'm not good at achieving for some reason when I've made other muffins.  Overall really great flavor and texture.  Will definitely make again!

OMG, these are amazing!  I did NOT alter the recipe one bit and they are the best muffins I have ever tasted.  The brown sugar and butter help cook the apples into a soft, carmelized treat.  As someone who likes a lot of spice I held back the urge to add cinnamon to the batter and am glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out moist and delicious with plenty of flavor. They smelled so good I had to have one before they'd even cooled off.  Made these to bring to work tomorrow but I sure hope I have enough left to bring in!  Just delicious.  Thank you, Jan!  I did have batter leftover after filling 12 muffin cups, however the batter was so yummy it wasn't a problem at all!

These were awesome - I used two large granny smith apples and chopped them but not into super fine pieces and they turned out great. Definitely a keeper! Also, leaving the recipe as is it made 16 muffins for me rather then the 12 it says. Bonus!

I usually put less sugar in my baked goods than the recipes call for, son I put 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cup of sugar, but I still found these a little too sweet. But other than that I thought this was a good recipe. I also added about 1/2 a cup of pecans and used whole wheat flour.

What a wonderful muffin. I did not add any additional spices and like it just as well. I did use greek yogurt instead of buttermilk (I never have buttermilk on hand) so they might be flavored different, but I think they are great!

These are fantastic and made the house smell wonderful.  The buttermilk cuts down on calories and keeps the muffins very moist.  Next time I will try and use only a 1/4 of butter and more buttermilk. These made 12 huge muffins with batter left over.  I could have probably made 18.  There is plenty of topping, I will probably half that part of the recipe next time.

These were FABULOUS!!  I HATE writing changes to recipes, and I do not recommend any changes, but if you happen to have extra apple pie filling sitting in the fridge needin' a purpose, then this also works REALLY well!  People went crazy for these at my church fellowship meeting, and they always look to see what I brought this time!  (Hoping for more of these!)  Thank You for posting a GREAT recipes that it perfect the way it is.

These muffins taste great, but also bake up beautifully as well! Only changes was added cinnamon to the batter as well and added apple slices on top for garnish. They were a hit from the kids to the grownups!

These are great. A nice alternative to a coffee cake too. I made a large batch of these and took some of the extras to my grandma. She did not believe I made them.

These were great!!! Definitely the most beautiful muffins I've ever made! I had to substitute milk for buttermilk bcause that's what I had. I did put cinnamon in the batter just because we love cinnamon and I'll probably use even more next time!

I made this as is, against my better judgment. The topping is great, but the muffin itself is extremely bland.

I bake pretty prolifically, and out of all the muffins I've made these get the most requests. I've had them described to me as "heaven." My dad was recently diagnosed with diabetes so I've been trying to adapt recipes to be more healthy, I made these with whole wheat flour and the splenda sugar blend, and they were still delicious, just having had the original they were disappointing.

Didn't have any eggs so I subsituted 1/4 cup apple sauce and cut the brown sugar to 1 cup. Was fantastic!

We really liked these. I had to only substitute regular white flour with whole wheat flour, as it's what I had on hand, and added an extra 1/2 cup of apples. Delicious and not too sweet. Perfect for Sunday brunch!

these are fast, simple, and scrumptious!  I didn't measure the apples, just diced up two good size apples, and made a few more than 36 mini-muffins.  Definitely one we'll do over and over!

The bottom of the muffin was absolutely delicious, but the topping was too crispy for me.  My teeth had a hard time taking it.  I might make again, but without the topping.

This is a great recipe but too sweet for my taste. I have made them twice now, once with brown splenda and the second time with white sugar (melted in the melted smart balance). If you do not have a sweet tooth use a cup or slightly less of sugar.I dont use eggs and so used Ener G egg replacer and also 1 tablespoon of Flaxseed meal mixed with 1 tablespoon of boiling water to make a paste.I added a teaspoon of baking powder. My muffin were raised high and very light and fluffy. I used smart balance spread instead of butter. I chopped the apples finely but each bite of muffin had apple in it.I added freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon and I think this is necessary.I also added 1 tablespoon of applesauce. A TIP! Do not over mix your batter! :-)

I tried this muffin recipe last week for my friends at work.....there was nothing but rave reviews and I came home with an empty container. I have been asked for them again. Thank you for a fantastic recipe. I didn't eat any myself (I'm on a diet) but they smelled delicious.

This was the best recipe ever.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used milk and cream of tartar as a substitute, and it worked just fine.  These muffins are moist and I am going to have to make another batch today because they are almost gone...Yum!

This recipie was amazing!! I used it in a bake sale that I was having for charity. Though there were many other items, this item was the best seller!! (and the most expensive item too)My family couldn't get enough of them either! They turned out just great!I used the topping as a filling as well as a topping, which was a good idea (anyone who likes these should try it, although you have to mix another batch of topping). And as most people say, you don't have to change a thing on the recipie! They turn out perfect! Not too much or too little of anything. Perfect!

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, but for personal preference I think I will make the apple pieces a little smaller next time.  Also, I baked for 25 minutes and was a little nervous about how brown the streusel topping looked, but it tasted great (not burnt at all).  These are very sweet though, and taste like something that came out a cafe bakery (which in my opinion, deserves a 5 star review). Thank you for this recipe!

I liked this recipe, but I agree with everyone who used more spices. This is what I did and my husband couldn't stop eating them. I mixed the apples with the nutmeg and cinnamon first but I also added apple pie spice and a teaspoon or so of crystalized ginger chopped, as well as about 2 table tblsp of thinly sliced orange peel and about 3 or 4 tblsp's of honey together before putting it in the batter.I also coated the bottom of the cupcake holder with powder sugar and butter.

Wow these are fabulous!  I made the recipe as described.  Only variation was that i didn't have enough brown sugar so subbed white sugar for the remainder (still had brown sugar in the topping), and i didn't have buttermilk so used 1 cup milk with 1 tbsp vinegar.

they are super yummy, and they do in fact taste like apple pie.  will definitely be making these again!

Excellent! Not a traditional apple muffin. Yummy, very moist and just great! It seemed like there was just too much batter for 12. I couldn't get a good muffin top. They were flat and fell apart when I took them out of the pan. It just meant we ate them out of a bowl instead!!!

I made a few changes due to personal preference... I used half white flour and half oat flour.  I also cut the butter in half and added an extra egg.  I didn't have any milk on hand so I used low fat apple yogurt.  I also grated the apple instead of dicing it.  Didn't use the topping on it, so I added the cinnamon to the batter.  Then I added a cup of quick oats.  Really good!

Divine..absolutely divine.  I didn't change a thing, made them exactly how the recipe was written.  Make sure you cool them well before taking them out if you don't use muffin papers, because they fell apart a little because I couldn't wait.  I don't know about the next day, because I just cooked them an hour ago!  I did add to the topping some carmel sprinkle I just bought from Pampered Chef.

These were very good.  Made as is except to add a bit of cinnamon to the batter.  I prefer the apple strudel recipe on this site just a little more.  I will use both recipes in the future.

I really wanted to try these muffins because they sounded so good but I was missing some ingredients so I had to changed it a bit to work with what I had. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup AP flour, applesauce instead of butter, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also doubled the baking soda to make them a little less dense. I also added a little cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg to the batter and skipped the topping. The muffins were wonderful! Very good recipe!

I am chomping on one of these babies "as we speak." I made 1/2 batch, and ended up with 7 good sized muffins [muffin cups lined, and filled to the top] I followed the recipe exactly as is, and I have to say that it is pretty darn good. Definitely "apple pie" tasting. I can see where some of the posters said they added cinnamon or what-not to the batter, that would give it a more "from the store package" taste--- over-all, not too shabby!

I didn't give it five-stars, only because   I am a newbie to this baking thing, and ended up with a sort of bitter apple... it didn't ruin it, but I think I'll make smarter apple choices. [[any suggestions on which apples are the best?]]

I loved these muffins.  I took them with me to a cottage for a weekend away with some new friends, and they were an instant hit.  The crumbled mixture on top makes these much better than your average muffin.

I used applesauce instead of apples.  Very tasty.

These turned out great!!  I added only 1 cup of apple, though, as I didn't have enough, and I added some cinnamon to the muffin mix itself.  Everyone who sampled loved it!!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!

WOW! These are great. As advised, I added some apple pie spice to the batter. I also chopped my apples coarsely. This one is definately a keeper!

These came out really good, but I must have done something wrong with the topping, because it says to "sprinkle it" on top of the muffins, and my topping was more of a goop. I still added it, and they ended up tasting great, so no harm done!

The batter made 12 big muffins, and they were devoured by 5 hungry guys in minutes.

These muffins are awesome! I had never made muffins from scratch before and was hoping that my first try would be a success. Everyone loved them! I have to add one thing though, I didn't realize until hours later that I had forgotten the egg!!  After trying them, I don't think it made one bit of difference. I plan to make these again for my Christmas brunch.

These are awesome!! I only had 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the house and was completely out of white sugar, so I used the 1/2 cup of brown sugar that I had and 1 cup of corn syrup (the only thing I thought could even remotely resemble sugar) I ommitted the topping because of my sugarless situation. But they turned out wonderful. They were not overly sweet. They were just right, I sprinkled some cinnamon on top. My husband just walked out the door with a dozen for his men's prayer breakfast group.

Great muffins! Got the husband's "thumbs up" (and he's picky). I added about 3/4 tbsp cinnamon to the muffin mix. Perfect consistency and great aroma! Tastes like something I'd buy at a bakery! Thanks for the recipe.

A great idea, and good-looking for a fancy breakfast. Flavor was just a tad lacking. Maybe additional apples or cinnamon would do the trick.

I cut the sugar in half on these.. as I can't stand things that are too sweet.  Very delicious.  Not something I'd eat on a regular basis but good for a treat.

This is the first 5 star recipe that I did not truly like. I made them for a neighbor who helped us fix our car. However, they weren't that tasty. I made the recipe as is, and found them to be rather bland. The struessel topping was just okay, too. I didn't think they were that sweet like some other reviews stated. Actually, I probably could have drizzled them with a bit of white icing.

I got two dozen medium-size muffins out of this recipe.
I used three small fuji apples, once cut I tossed them with a little white sugar and cinnamon. Next time I'll try granny smith for a stronger apple flavor.
Instead of buttermilk I substituted 1 cup low fat milk + 1 3/4 tablespoons cream of tartar (mix together, heat 30 sec, let sit while you mix up other ingredients)

These muffins are good right from the oven but even better the next morning.

I added 1 t. cinnamon to the batter like other reviewers suggested and used 1/2 t. cinnamon in the topping. It was the right amount for our tastes. I got 18 standard size muffins rather than 12, and there was still plenty of streusel.

These were very good and moist.  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as recommended by others.  These muffins do not rise as much as typical muffins do.

This was an incredible recipie!  the muffins came out great. I did add 1/2  teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as some suggested.  Every one that tried them loved them.  Next time I'm going to use blueberries instead of apples because my kids prefer blueberries but will definately make again and again!  Thank you!

Anyone not liking the flavor isn’t using the right/ripe apples! I personally added one extra apple, and swapped the butter in the batter with fresh applesauce! These are amazing as is, tender, soft, and bouncy!  No need to spice it, with the right apples, but it’s definitely a great option to add it! Will be making indefinitely!

Delicious! Substituted 1% milk and lemon juice for buttermilk. Muffins baked well. They were very good and we will definitely make them again! They were a bit time-consuming though.

Made these a little earlier for our breakfast. They are so good! ??I did make some changes because my husband is diabetic and I don’t have a very big appetite. I changed the nuts to 2 cups of pecan. Nuts slow down the absorption of sugars and carbs. I made normal cupcake size muffins with 1/2 cup batter per cup. About 20 carbs per muffin. I baked 16 minutes. Yielded 2 1/2 dozen.

Was looking for a recipe to make using what I had on hand.  Following the advice of previous reviewers, I followed the recipe AS IS and my rating is based on the recipe AS IS (as it should be).  Wonderful!  That said, per our own individual family preferences, I would likely use a little less brown sugar in the batter and topping next time I make it.

Good flavor but overflowed when filling to top of cups, batter needs more pie flavor, and butter leaked thru liners and was drippy.

Very moist and delicious.  I made the recipe just as it says.  I wouldn’t change a thing.  These muffins turned out fantastic with just the right amount of cinnamon with the streusel on top.  This is my new go-to apple muffin recipe.  Thank you!

I am not a fan of Apple Pie, but I tried the recipe for my son and husband. It was amazingly delicious and made me buy a lot of apples and freeze them so I have available ingredients all the time. I never thought I would be into Apple Pie. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I added walnuts and I prefer the muffins with the walnuts. 
I didn't have buttermilk so I combined 1/2 c. sour cream and added milk to make up the difference.  It worked fine. 
I also added a touch of cloves only 1/4 tsp. (which is the same thing I do with apple pie)

I just made these to take to work with me tomorrow for the other bus drivers.  My crab apple tree was loaded and although the apples are good, they are small and tend to be softer, so I needed a recipe that did not need tart or crisp apples.  
I made the recipe exaclty as listed, except that I only filled the cups 2/3 full, so the recipe made 18 muffins, instead of the 12 listed.  They came out very nice, although a little bit dark on the edges, and they taste as good as they look.  My son, who does not like apples, ate one and then helped himself to another without asking - luckily, that still leaves me with just enough for my co-workers.

I had to adjust it for high altitude.  I added a few tablespoons of flour, took out a couple tablespoons of sugar, and added almost a third of a cup extra buttermilk.  I also needed more butter for the crumble (I ended up using an entire 1/4 cup which is twice as much as it says).  It still only needed to cook for 25 minutes.

I read other reviews that liked the recipe without lots of modifications, so followed recipe, and my family really enjoyed it.  They liked that it was sweet, but not overly sweet and loved the apple flavoring.  Can't wait to make again!

I will make this again. It was a triple batch for a party and they demolished it. My picture is the five that were left from 3 dozen. I left them in about two minutes longer than the 25, but that's the only change I made other than a 3x batch.

These turned out great. Really good flavor and were perfectly moist. The recipe yielded 16 muffins for me. They need like 27 minutes to bake. I used muffin baking cups and they peeled off easily. I didn’t have buttermilk; or any milk for that matter so I used evaporated milk. Again, they were totally delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. I didnt have buttermilk so I substituted milk with a splash of vinegar and I accidentally grabbed dark brown sugar instead of light. I also made it with pears that were over ripe and the next time I made it with raspberries. Great base recipe, my family keeps coming up with new ideas to try.

Amazing! The apples and generous amount of crumble made the muffins very heavy, so they were difficult to take out of the tin without getting messed up. Would recommend using muffin liners!! Best muffins ever, and my family seems to agree. Wish I had some vanilla ice cream to go with

These are wonderful! I made some adjustments: used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour, used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and substituted vegetable oil for butter. I make a topping with walnuts, brown sugar, Cinnamon! That was really yummy, it was a nice crunchy contrast to the moist muffin. I was able to get 18 muffins from the recipe!

Oh Yum!!! I made a few edits to my batch ... whole wheat flour (it’s all we ever use) and I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  These are GREAT warm and (as a dessert) perfect beside a scoop of ice cream.  My family loves them.  The topping - you can reduce by nearly half as there’s a LOT left over.

Made these the other day, and have had rave reviews from everybody!  Only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter with the rest in the topping.  I found it made 18 muffins, with way too much topping.  Which was fine since they're so good.

I made them exactly as the recipe said and they were awesome! Next time I’ll add a bit more butter to the topping (i like it a bit more runny) and I’ll add a pinch of cinnamon to the muffins.

I made these per the recipe except about half of the crumble top- I was afraid they would be too sweet that way. I also added walnuts to the topping for extra crunch. Loved the muffins- not too sweet like I said, perfect for a breakfast muffin.

I made half of this recipe and got 10 standard muffins using a 1/4 c. dry measuring cup to scoop the batter out with. 

The one change I made was I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar instead of all brown sugar. These are very sweet so I'll have to use a little more salt next time.

Absolutely AWESOME!  Don't make any changes......these are scrumptious just the way they are!  They were very crumbly on top, but I made 11 BIG ones & I think I put too much topping on. You could reduce that by half unless you like a lot!  I was skeptical about the baking SODA rather than POWDER...... but it worked just fine.

My husband and daughter went nuts over these.  There wasn't any specification on the amount.  It made 18, which lasted longer than I thought, considering the way they were in such high demand.  The only change I made was putting a tsp of allspice in the batter.  Otherwise I followed it exactly.  Great recipe,  thanks!

The taste was great, mine turned out crumbly. BUT I ran out of brown sugar, had to use white instead and had no molasses to add either. I will be making these again and have no doubt they will hold together well with the right ingredients. Even my daughter, who usually snubs Apple muffins, really enjoyed them.

These muffins are fabulous!  I made a few minimal changes, first, I cut back on brown sugar in the batter to 1 cup, and added some Splenda.  I love cinnamon, so I added a tsp of this to the batter.  To enhance the apple flavor I added 1/4 cup boiled cider, and reduced the buttermilk to 3/4 cup.  I predict that the family will be treated with these again this fall!

These were awesome.  The only change that I made was that rather than using melted butter for the topping I used softened butter and a pastry blender to mix it well..  the topping turned out beautifully.

These muffins are terrific!  I've made them many times.  Seems like I always have an over ripe pear on hand, so I usually do half-apple, half-pear.  YUMMY!

I added a lot of cinnamon to the batter to make it more like apple pie, I am very glad I did.  I think it would have been more like apple muffins not apple pie without it.

I've been making these for years and people love them. I cut the sugar in the muffins back to 1 cup, though. And I don't always use the topping. Yes, it's yummy but to me it turns them into a dessert, not a dinner item. Or a very special occasion muffin. 

I like to add 1 T cinnamon and 1/8 t nutmeg because we love cinnamon. I usually use a good baking apple like Granny Smith or Jonathan so they'll be full of yummy flavor.

If you don't have buttermilk you can sour regular milk and it works just fine.

I made this with no modifications excepts that I double the apples (I used 5 small apples). With this measurement I made exactly 24 muffins. The muffins taste and look so good!

These are very good muffins.  I cut down the sugar to 1 cup because I don't want that much sugar in my food.  I felt they were plenty sweet with that much sugar in them.

So easy to make and came out awesome!!  The topping was my favorite part- yummy.  hubby kept commenting on how light and fluffy the muffins were.  I added a few shakes of cinnamon to the diced apples- just because i love cinnamon... i'm sure it would have been great without it.  it made 18 decent sized muffins for me.  will make all the time now!

This is a great recipe and made them over Christmas break.  FYI this recipes makes 24 muffins and so glad I made 1/2 recipe.  I made one half batch regular and the other half batch Gluten Free for my husband.

The best apple muffins I've ever had.  Lost my old recipe, and I followed this recipe exactly.  Absolutely delicious!!  Very moist.  The muffin tops were wonderful.  I did let them "rest" in the pan a bit before I carefully got them out with the edge of a knife.  Definitely a keeper!!

Wow!! These are amazing! I’ve made these 3 times, and the only thing I added was a caramel glaze. Trust me, you don’t need to adjust any of the ingredients! RAVE reviews with many requests for the recipe. The third time around, I made them in mini muffin tins... I didn’t think it was possible, but the mini ones were even better!! For minis, I decreased the temp by 25*F and cooked for 10-12 minutes.

These muffins are fluffy and light and taste like apple cake! The only changes I made were to add 3/4 cup apple pie filling as part of the 2 cups of diced apples the recipe called for. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar to make up for the sugar in the apple pie filling. Also, I added 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the batter as I found the batter slightly bland without spice. These turned out great and I'll make these again!

Wow these are deeeeelicious!! I even messed up the topping. I was distracted by the kids helping and did not melt the butter prior to mixing it with the sugar and flour. The topping still worked but next time I’ll make them correctly. I made these exactly as written (except for my mistake) and No modifications are necessary. My kids & their friends devoured them. Will definitely make these again thank you Jan for such a wonderful recipe!

Wonderfully moist. I substituted sour milk for buttermilk. I found the topping a bit "heavy"  but very good tasting.

These are great!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger for spice.  I didn't make the crumb topping because my 2 kids are sugared up enough.  They are very good without it too.

Delicious!  Not too sweet.  The only thing I felt was missing was suggesting the type of apple to use.  So without that, I used granny smith and it was a good choice-firm and tart.  I think a honey crisp would work well too if you like them a little sweeter.

These muffins turned out great. The recipe makes too much streusel topping. We used all of it and it became a crisp coating on the top. I will definitely only sprinkle next time. The muffin itself is light and sweet. It's a great recipe.

These were so delicious,  I was not dissapointed! The only thing I did different was to substitute maple syrup for vanilla since I was unaware I had run out and also just added a pinch of nutmeg to topping because I love it. I took them to work and felt like a baking goddess with all of the raves about them! Will be making again for sure. Thank goodness I doubled to keep some at home! I used paper liners and came out just fine. I thought I would have a burnt crumb mess on top of my cupcake pans with all of the topping crumbs, but when the tops filled out they gathered up the extra crispy crumbs and baked right in! Impressed!

Very tasty and quick to put together.  Brought these to a fund raiser for sale and they went very quickly!  My family was very happy that we kept some at home for ourselves.  Would definitely make these again [and again and again...].

OH my goodness! These are so good!! I just went apple picking and didn't know what to do with 15 pounds of apples so I decided to make these delicious muffins. I took many other reviewers' advice--just follow the recipe to a T. I am so happy I did not add anything to these, the apple flavor is perfect just the way it is! Topped with ice cream? Now that's a real treat!

I followed the directions as is. The tops of the muffins were flat, I would not fill the cups all the way full as they flowed over the top of the muffin tin as they cooked. They tasted nice and sweet.

I made dairy-free substitutions (coconut oil = butter & coconut milk + lemon juice = buttermilk). Oh my.... amazing, so delicious and moist. I made these in a hurry and forgot the cinnamon, my muffins taste more like Caramel Apple muffins. No complaints there but next time I will not forget the cinnamon. Thanks for the amazing recipe. Perfect in the fall with all the apples to use up.

What a treat these muffins were ! This recipe made 12 regular size muffins and 4 mini ones for me.
Hearing about more children and teens suffering from Diabetes, I try to cut the sugar down when baking.  
so, usually for 12 muffin recipe, I use 3/4 cup of sugar. But since this recipe calls for 1 1/2 cup, I used 1 cup instead and the muffins came out plenty sweet. Also I prefer to shred the apples instead of dicing them.

Delicious! I followed the recipe very closely, just added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and cut the topping by half.  I'll be making these again!

This is a great recipe and very easy to follow. I did add extra apples and it turned out amazing. Not super sweet and very tasty.  I'm going to make this again.

Instead of raw apples, added a can of Apple pie filling. Next time, I won't fill the cups too full, plus I will add a little less melted butter to my topping  mixture.

I just these muffins. There name really lives up to them. Because one of my boys is allergic to soy and cow milk I had to change some thinks. One buttermilk: I put one tablespoon of lemon juice and added almond milk until it reached one cup. Then I let it sit for five minutes then I used it. Then I had to substitute all of the butter with oil. You could not even tast the difference. I know I am going to make this again.

Moist and delicious, this tasty muffin was full of apple flavour! I prepared these with a mix of shredded apples as well as small chunks, which made for a nice texture. I had a lot of streusal  topping left over; would like to swirl some of that into the batter next time. This recipe is a keeper!

2nd time I've made these, possibly the third. Yowza!  They are delectable delights of apple and cinnamon goodness.  My personal twist is only that after sprinkling on the "1st" layer of topping I press it down a bit and I do a little finger poke action in the center of each muffie to get the topping into the dough better.  Then I gently apply a little more topping for an extra sweet crunch factor on top.  Oh yes, yes, yes, sensually delicious.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I have made these twice, the first time I was a bit lazy and didn't measure carefully, etc. and they did not rise and were messy. The second time, I measured carefully, folded ingredients just until moist (17 folds of the spoon for tender muffins - like I learned in Home Ec. in the 70's) and added about 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. They were delicous and really tasted a lot like apple pie. If I make them again I would use 1 sweet and 1 tart apple, because I like a bit of zing in my fruit desserts - not all sweetness! Thank you

Wonderful as written! My teenage son can't get enough of these- they make a great breakfast to go.  I love the apple flavor- too many spices would make it more like spice cake.

I took the advice of other reviewers and subbed 1/2 applesauce for the butter and used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also used 1 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups. They turned out amazing and not too sweet although I would cut the streusel topping in half next time to make them healthier.

Wow! These are delicious!
I am a big muffin cook and I was skeptical to try a new recipe. I am so glad I did.
The ingredients list does not match the written recipe, however, I followed the written recipe and it was delicious.
I experimented and left the skin on the apples. They were great and were perfectly soft and cooked. You couldn't tell the skin was left on. It saves time. 
I also ran out of regular flour, so I used whole wheat flour for just the topping. The topping was delicious.
I filled my regular 12 muffin pan and the muffins were big with nice muffin tops. Perfect!
I am running out right now to get more flour since I know these will be going quick and my crew will be begging for more.

Unreal!!! My whole house smelled like apple pie! Took the last reviewers advice and followed the recipe to a T! The batter yielded approx 18 medium sized muffins for me. Came out moist, and fluffy! Left my apple quite chunky. These muffins are a delicious fall treat! I'm making more as we speak!!  Truly apple pie; in a muffin!! Try them!

These muffins were delicious, but I felt that they lacked in apple flavor. Next time I make them (I'm sure that that will happen very soon!) I will add more apples or maybe apple sauce. When I do, I will update this review. I didn't feel that the muffins needed more spices, they were fine with just streusel! I would recommend that you just make them as they are but add more apple.

I didn't think that the apple flavor was enough.  Maybe it was the apples I used but it was more cake than apple to me. I probably wouldn't make these again.

Omg these are so good. We went apple picking and now have an abundance of apples. I've never actually had an apple muffin before, but even after we canned a bunch of other Apple recipes we still had a ton left. Made them exactly as the recipe reads and they are amazing! Even without the topping (lol me and the kids got hungry and curious) the were so good! I'm going to triple this recipe and stock the freezer for an easy breakfast for my kids. My only comment- watch your oven. I used pans that hold 12 muffins and mine were done in 20

Made it as the recipe stated. They were delicious. I might chop the apples smaller, but that's just personal taste. Loved the topping.

Great recipe. Turned out lovely.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand so used 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup 2% milk mixed well instead. I also can't have too much sugar but didn't want to stray too far so reduced it by 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it came out perfectly sweet for my taste. I also read from another reviewer that you don't need to make that much of the brown sugar topping since there would be a lot leftover so I made half that portion and it came out just enough with no leftover. The batter was enough to make 14 regular sized cupcakes.

Muffins were great, I sent them in as a school snack for my son (after sampling one) - both the teachers and kids enjoyed them!  I did skip the streudel topping, just to make it less messy (crumby) in the classroom.  If I were to skip the topping again, I'd add the cinnamon to the batter - that was the only thing missing.  I love buttermilk anything, and there was definitely the distinctive buttermilk taste. I will definnitely make them again.

Very light  and fluffy. Not dense like some muffins. I used Figi apples. The rest of the recipe was followed as written. The crumb topping is very hard and crunchy though almost candy-like. Tasty but would have preferred a genuine crumb top.  Glad I used the paper liners because anyplace the crumb topping settled stuck tight!  I would make again. Maybe reduce the cook time a bit.
edit: muffin much better the next day, more moist and flavorful the topping is softer due to the moisture from the apples. (changed rating from 4 to 5 stars!)

I liked this recipe, I was craving for a good apple muffin and this recipe is good with some modifications. They are tasty and moist and a lot of apple flavor. I had to change a few things like the amount of sugar, I reduced it to 4 tablespoons for the muffin mix, and add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoon of wheatgerm (to add more fiber to them). I don't know what I did with the crumb topping, got a little messy with that, next time I have to reduce the amount of butter, with this changes they were so delicious!

(I did add 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, though. I will do this again next time and will also use less brown sugar.)

I made these today and doubled the recipe. I added cinnamon (2 tsp.), nutmeg (1 tsp.), and all spice (1/2 tsp.) to the dry ingredients for the batter because everyone in my circle loves spicy baked goods. I used six smallish golden delicious apples (peeled, cored, and diced) and sprinkled them with a few spoonfuls of white sugar and a dusting of cinnamon and let them sit for 30 minutes  before adding them to the batter. I made the streusel and added some nutmeg (1 tsp.) to it. While the muffins are delicious I don't really like the streusel. I think next time I will make the oatmeal streusel from this pumpkin muffin recipe or leave it out all together. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228562/pumpkin-muffins-with-streusel-topping/#recipe-toolbar

These are delicious! I followed the recipe to a tee. The only thing I would change for next time is the crumble topping, which ended up being too much. I would use less flour. Other than that, soooo good! I would also love to see if I could cram in more apples.

I don't usually bake things like muffins or biscuits because they never seem to come out right. Well these came our perfect the first time. I did exactly as instructed in the directions accept I didn't have any butter milk so I used evaporated milk and my family loved it. Thank you!

I was excited about this recipe because it had such great reviews, but I was disappointed at how crumbly the muffins were. They did not hold together at all. I followed the recipe as written, but I must have done something wrong. They tasted really good, I'd just like to be able to at least get my muffin to a plate before it falls apart.

These were amazing. I've made them twice, once without the crumble on top (I added the cinnamon into the batter directly), and once with- they were good both ways, it just depends on how many calories per muffin you want. I also turned these into mini-muffins one time, you have to chop the apples up into smaller pieces than usual, and also adjust the cooking time, but other than that, they also turned out perfectly! I have received rave reviews and many requests for the recipe every time I've made them!

Wonderful, moist flavorful muffins that really do taste a lot like apple pie. Made with 3 cups diced apples, coated with a little cinnamon.  Otherwise as written. Delicious!

Loved it. Instead of making crumb topping when the muffins were done , I crumbled graham cookies and I sprinkled them on top. It was the  yummiest muffin I ever tried.

I was so excited to try these muffins!  Maybe I built them up too much, but it was a bit of a let-down when I actually tasted one.  I followed the recipe exactly, but felt the muffins were missing something.  I wish I would've gone with my instinct and added some cinnamon or apple pie spice to the batter... it just seemed rather plain to me.  These aren't bad muffins, just not what I was hoping for.  Although I do have to say, they were better the next day.  I feel it is also important to note that, even though I didn't change a thing in the recipe I got 2 dozen muffins from this - and I filled the muffin cups pretty much to the top!

I followed the recipe exactly, and made two batches. I need them for a work potluck and wanted to see how I liked them before I made a double batch. I used the topping for both batches, as it made quite a bit. I really loved this recipe, the muffins looked beautiful when they came out of the oven, and weren't overly sweet. I will definitely make these again!

Excellent! I used gala apples. I did add a pinch of cinnamon to the flour mixture and cut back the brown sugar slightly. They turned out delicious. My kids love them as well.

Fantastic recipe!  I made it exactly as recipe and everyone loved them.  I took them out of the oven after 20 minutes, they didn't need the full 25 minutes.  I'm not sure what type of apples I used, After apple picking there was a variety of apples in my basket.   I only needed 3 small apples.

tasty simple muffins. Did find a discrepancy between the video and recipe list, video says 1/2 cup butter while recipe list is 1 tablespoon. muffins still turned out fine with less butter.

I made a double batch. To lighten them just a bit, I did 3/4c. butter total for a double batch instead of 1c. and added 1/4c. unsweetened organic applesauce. I used whole wheat pastry flour in the streusel topping. I got 34 out of a double batch instead of the indicated 1dzn per batch, which my family was thrilled about. And, my oven is usually right on and mine were down in about 17-18 minutes instead of the 25 minutes called for in the recipe. Delicious!

Soft, sweet, lovely apple taste. I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the apples since my apple pie has cinnamon in it.  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup which was still too sweet for me but my DH (who is critical of overly sweet foods) thought it was perfect. I used crumb topping with oats leftover from my apple crisp recipe. Recipe made 20 regular size muffins.

I added 1/2 Cup of raisins and a dash of cinnamon to the batter. I only filled the muffin tins 3/4 of the way and ended up with 19 muffins. Big hit with the family!

Absolutely amazing moist apple muffins! So yummy and delicious. Yet very easy to make. The buttermilk dough is the best for muffins in my opinion. Apples add the sweetness that makes them absolutely impossible to skip :)

Made these exactly as stated. I used cupcake liners successfully, filling the muffin cup to the top. I was worried but they domed nicely and came out of the pan very easily. These are very rich so I don't know that I would make them often but they are a great treat! I thought all the topping made them excessively sweet but Hubs ate 2 of them right away and loved them (he eats to live, so he doesn't often overindulge). They are even better the next day but I have to agree with those that added cinnamon to the batter, I will add it next time. Great way to use up a couple apples and makes the house smell heavenly! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jan!

Probably the best muffins I have ever tasted!! The third time I made these, instead of dicing the apples (who has time for that?) I sliced and blended them in my Magic Bullet. I preferred this modification because the apple flavor was more evenly distributed throughout the whole batter. Other than that, I didn't change a thing and the muffins turned out amazing!!!

This is perfect - don't change anything. I got 16 standard size muffins from the recipe. Served the muffins to some incredible cooks and they asked ME for the recipe; now that's success! Just an added note: one large apple = the 2 cups of apples. A definite keeper recipe!

WOW, what amazing muffins, they really do taste like apple pie. I had a friend over and he had some and loved them. At work he told everyone how good they were and now they all want some. I didnt have any buttermilk so i made my own; 1 cup of milk for 1 tbs of lemon juice, and it did the trick. So i URGE everyone to make it atleast once and i'm sure that you will add it to your recipe box.

These muffins are fantastic! They rise nicely and look great coming out of the oven. The taste was good, and reminded me of the apple cake I make. It smelled delicious and overall, turned out well.

Moist and delicious. I followed the recipe as written and would not change a thing. My wife and son both gave two thumbs up. Between the three of us, the muffins lasted about a half day.

Thought it was great as the recipe was - did not make any changes.  I did not have buttermilk so I mixed 1tbsp lemon juice with 1cup milk as a replacement.

Wow!  I am so glad I read the reviews before I made this and went with the reviewer that said they are perfect just the way they are!  I had reservations as I made these just the way the recipe said, without any spices....but I went with it.  It makes for a super moist and apply muffin.  The streusel topping adds just the right amount of cinnamon.  Take my advice and make these the way they are written.  My only difference is that I got 23 muffins as opposed to 12!  (my husband is ooohin and aaahing right now!)

These were scrumptious, I followed the recipe and got 18 out of my batter, so even more to love.  They smelled amazing while baking too.

Very good muffins! Tasty and really moist! I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used regular milk. I also doubled the cinnamon and grated half of the apples. Definitely will make this recipe again it was a hit with my friends and family!

Used 3/4 cup plain yogurt + 1/4 milk as substitute for buttermilk.  Make sure to melt butter as directed - it makes a difference.  I always add chopped walnuts (2/3 cup).  Made 24 standard size muffins, but I only fill about 2/3 full.  Any fuller and the streusel topping spills over and cooks onto the pan edges making removal from the pan difficult.  It is good to use foil liners on this one(usually i go without any liners)to make handling and removal easier.

I really liked these. No, they don't taste like apple pie, but they are still delicious. I loved the texture of the apple pieces in the muffin. I found the sweetness to be just right. I only changed one thing, and that was using half brown sugar and half white in the batter, since I ran out of brown sugar. I did use brown sugar for the topping.
The topping did get quite crunchy, which I think is a nice contrast to the moist, soft bottom part.
I do have to say, filling the muffin cups all the way to the top is not a good idea. They did rise over the sides. I didn't have any problems getting them out in one piece though, as some other comments said. They came right out.
So, all in all, I think they are fine the way they are, no changes necessary.

These muffins were great.  The only modification I made to this recipe was adding a dash of cinnamon to the batter, and to be honest, it wasn't even really necessary.  I was a bit unsure about filling the muffin cups to the top, but I did and the muffins rose just enough to look perfectly rounded.  They looked, smelled, and tasted great.  I'll be making these again. :)

These are excellent, very moist, I only baked 20 minutes, 25 minutes, they'd have been to dry. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1/2 c. each, sour cream & strawberry yogurt....I didn't have enough sour cream either..lol...they didn't taste of strawberry either. I know I'll be making these a lot as my husband gets hit up everyday at work for his baked goods that I send in his lunch bucket. Thanks for the great recipe Jan Brown.

I made this with my friend and instead of making the crumbs to put on top, we added crystalized sugar sprinkles instead. They still tasted amazing and were a lot less work. The first time we used the regular crystals (the clear ones) but for a more colorful appearance we also tried colored sprinkles. The muffins were amazing and great for breakfast.

This is delightful. I did change a few things due to unavailable ingredients. Didn't have enough brown sugar so I used 1C of white sugar + 1/2C brown sugar for the muffin portion. (I know it's important for the topping to be brown sugar.)  I only put 1/4C of flour in the topping, but added 1/4C quick oats and about 1Tbs of melted butter to topping as well. I'm glad my modifications didn't ruin this recipe. They are totally worth gashing my fingertip while peeling the apples!

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the only change I'll make next time is to increase the amount of topping I make, because I ran out. But that's because I didn't "sprinkle" the topping on the muffins... I gave them a heavy layering.  The topping is the proverbial icing on the cake, so don't skimp.  :)

Nice muffin recipe.  I reduced the sugar by half, and it was still a little overly sweet for us.  Next time I will go with only 1/2 cup sugar.  I did replace 1/2 the butter with oil and the other half with a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Still very moist.

I just made a batch and oooooooooooooooooooh, yum, yum! I did add ground cloves and nutmeg to the streusel and I sneaked in a bit of extra cinnamon into the batter itself, too.  Very moist, cakey, and simply a wonderful treat for apple lovers.  I would recommend using an oven foil tray because quite a bit of the streusel falls off during the baking period and some pieces get burnt.  Nevertheless, it is worth the mess in the oven and on my floor.  I probably would rename them Apple Streusel Muffins because they did not taste pie-y to ME. That is just an opinion and not a criticism!!  So glad I found this recipe to use up some of my wrinkled apples!

The crumble top IS messy, and that is my only negative note.  I used 1/3 less brown sugar in the dough, and it was more than sweet enough.  They do not rise a lot, but I like my homemade muffins to be a bit dense - otherwise, it's like a cupcake!!

Very good! Didn't have enough brown sugar for the streusel, so I substituted white. Also made buttermilk from whole milk and apple cider vinegar (a cup plus a tablespoon) but my family loved it!

I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 of a cup and it was perfect.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batch because I can't imagine apple muffins without some, and omitted the topping because I was just too lazy to mix it together. They were really good.

Yummy! I didn't have buttermilk or butter, so I just used regular milk and vegetable oil. I had to bake it a bit longer than 25 minutes but I'm at a high altitude so that could effect it. Overall it's a delicious muffin and even though 1 1/2 cups of sugar seems like a lot it doesn't make the muffin overly sweet. I'll make these again! :)

Amazing! I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used half and half. I also used 3 cups of apples, to which I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little bit of honey. I'm so glad I used this recipe!

This was delicious and my kids loved them! I halved the sugar content, used wholewheat flour and used oil instead of butter (only b/c I didn't have any) and they were great. I didn't do the topping either so I added cinnamon to the mixture. This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty good, but I did alter it. I did 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour. I used 1/2 cup of leftover milky whey mixed with 1/2 cup whole milk as the buttermilk and used big swedish sugar as the topping. Next time, I'll follow the recipe and use the topping including cinnamon.

These are really good and moist as everyone promised - the hubby gobbled up a muffin and he's not even into baked goods (unless they are really moist - on the second muffin he actually said it was his favorite thing I've ever baked)!  The muffin is really sweet (especially with the topping) - I will take it down to 1 cup of brown sugar next time (especially when apples are in season).  Used honeycrisp apples.  LDS girl was right - only half the topping is needed, I still had left over topping (and I even took a lot of it off since it was so sweet.  Threw in a tsp of cinnamon into the batter and could see half a tsp of nutmeg or so really sealing the deal for the 'apple pie'ness.  I got 12 perfect muffins out of this recipe!  Also made buttermilk (never keep any on hand and didn't want to buy a whole thing for it) by putting 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and topping off with milk to make a cup, and letting that sit for 5-10 minutes.

I made this recipe this afternoon. It is a keeper! The only thing I found, was that it made more than what is stated above. I ended up with 12 large muffins, and then added some chopped pecans and made another 12 mini muffins! Both were delicious. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I thought these were absolutely amazing!  I followed the recipe as written and they came out super moist and flavorful....definitely a sweet treat.  The boy gave them a 4 rating only because he said they didn't have as much apple flavor as he thought they should.  I still say 5 stars all the way!  I will be making these again for sure....and soon!

We liked the flavor of these muffins, however they didn't rise very much at all.  I don't know what went wrong, I checked over all of the ingredients again and I didn't forget anything. I won't say that I will never make them again, but I do like my muffins to have a top on them and not be flat.  Because of the appearance, I wouldn't want to serve these to guests.  But as I said, they were tasty...so I give them 3 1/2 stars.

This was delish! Instead of making muffins I made a loaf. I used the recipe exactly as is and it turned out wonderful. Except I did notice that cooking on 375 made the topping burn a little, so next time I'll cook on 350 and just for a longer period of time.

I made this yesterday and they were soooooooo good!!  Made exactly as recipe calls except I did add 1 tsp cinnamon to the muffin batter and added a bit more apples (maybe closer to 3 cups because I didn't measure as I was cutting them up and didn't want to waste what I had already diced).  I tasted the batter before putting them in my muffin tins and I was a little worried because it tasted really sweet however I proceed and added the topping and when they were baked they were perfect!!  Not to sweet at all. I got 17 muffins out of the recipe.  I highly recommend you give this recipe a try!

To start off with I love these muffins! I've made them a couple times and every time my family and friends devour them. But I must say though the recipe on its own is great, I do agree with some that you might need to add more cinnamon, in the dry ingredients I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon and also cut a third of the sugar because of the over powering sweetness that I don't like too much. Other then the extra cinnamon I think this recipe is amazing and should be made by everyone. So if you like your fall treats you should add this to you to bake list.  5*

I had an abundance of ripe pears from a neighbor's tree and needed something to do with them, so I decided to try this recipe.  I didn't think about the juiciness of the pears (that had been cut up in the fridge the previous day) compared to apples that were just cut, so the first time I made it, it was extra moist and had pretty flat tops.  (Although my daughter LOVED it that way.)  The second time, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and a teaspoon of baking powder and they came out PERFECT!  My family loves this recipe.  It is a keeper.  Thanks!

I've made these twice - once for my family and once for a bake sale at work.  They didn't last an hour at the bake sale! The first thing to sell out.  These are delicious and moist. The only change I made is that I added cinnamon to the batter and added a pinch of nutmeg to the topping. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly - enjoyed it, however, I do not think it needs an entire stick of melted butter.  I will definitely make this again, but will reduce the butter by at least a couple tablespoons; I don't think the moistness will be affected at all.  The flavor is nice and not over-run with spices.

These were really good, I liked that they weren't overpowered with spices...the apple flavor really came through.  They were so moist they almost didn't seem done but they were.  I did a fairly medium dice, next time I think I will do a finer dice just my preference.  Everyone gobbled them up.  Can't wait to make with local farm apples this fall!

I wish I could give 5 stars...I really do.  While the muffins are extremely tasty and flavorful, they are extremely messy and don't rise.  As other reviewers said, the muffins are flat and ooze over the muffin pan.  I, too, followed the recipe to the letter.  Next time I will add some baking powder, fill the tins 2/3 full and make 18-24 muffins versus the 12.  I also think that par-baking the apples slightly before adding to the batter would help enhance the apple flavor.

Loved these muffins. I I didn't have buttermilk, and found I could use yogurt, so I used a cup of Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk. The muffins were delicious and I will make these again.

These are so good! I couldn't stop eating them. I got 20 regular sized muffins out of the mixture, and at 20 minutes they were done. I think next time I will take them out a few minutes earlier, as they were almost a little too done.

Amazing!! I made these muffins for a dinner party and everyone loved them!! i'm just starting to learn how to cook and bake and these were really easy to make! 
another thing that wasn't so clear to me at first, you need to peel the apples before dicing them.
I followed this recipe exactly as said, but I will make two changes next time i make these:
1. MORE APPLES! 2 cups is not enough, i will add at least another apple.
2. less sugar on top of the muffins,its just too sweet.

besides that i really loved these.

So a lot of things turned out well but our muffin looking like a cupcake but flat. Other than that the recipe was good to follow. But our muffin didn't look like a professional one. We didn't have to change anything in the ingredients. Another thing is that it turned out and it wouldn't have had any changes because its tasted good. The final product looked like a flat dark muffin. I would recommend this to other people because its taste really good.

This recipe was pretty easy and simple. It had clear directions and was very easy to follow. Sadly, our final muffin did not turn out like the professional picture. According to the recipe it should have made 6 muffins, but at the end of our baking process we ended up making 8-9 muffins instead. Our muffins didn't have the right shape because we over mixed the batter. So don't over mix! In the end I still would recommend this recipe to another person. Not only is this easy to follow but the muffins taste pretty good.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  I made it this afternoon and my husband and I love it.  I read reviews where people said it stuck, but mine didn't - I greased the muffin pan really well and also around the tops, and that did the trick.  Also, I had apples, topping and some batter left over, so I greased a bowl and put the apple slices and batter together and topped with the brown sugar mix.  Worked out perfectly.  Will make again!  April 10 2013.  Other people have now made this recipe - they asked me for it and every last one of them loves it.

I had some apples. I had some strawberries. I had a mission.

I was looking for a good apple muffin recipe to modify into a strawberry-apple muffin and I settled on this; I didn't much except that I made my buttermilk (using 1TBS lemon juice and less than a cup of milk) and added in the strawberries (about 1 cup of diced strawberries; took me six large berries) and I used two whole apples (which came out to something more like 2.25 cups once diced); I didn't do the crumble top because I'm just not a fan.

WOAH did these cook way too quickly. After 18 minutes I'd burned 7 of the 20 muffins that I'd made. :( That's the reason for knocking the star off; if I'd have known they'd cook so fast, I would have kept checking every five minutes. I'm not used to muffins cooking like this. They also didn't really "puff up" with a muffin top. This is something that I absolutely need/want from my muffins and these guys did not fit the bill.

STILL, they were delicious (and I don't even like apple pie!). If you wanna try an extra surprise, I REALLY suggest adding in some Strawberries. They absolutely make the muffin for me.

I made this into 24 smaller muffins and cut some of the sugar.  We loved the simple apple muffin with all the spices on top.

This was a great after dinner treat!  I made the recipe as written, and it was easy and delicious! I haven't made any muffins or cupcakes since home ec back in the 70s, so this was a fun re-start to baking.  As I overloaded the crumb topping, there was plenty of cinammon taste(and my cinnamon is fresh from Penzey's).  Next time I will lighten up on the topping, as it became a bit crunchy on the edges.  It definitely makes more than a dozen, but I ended up tossing the leftover batter and topping.  I only could find one muffin/cupcake tin in the house and didn't feel like keeping the oven on another 25 minutes. Thanks for sharing the recipe Jan!

This recipe took care of my muffin craving! I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 1 tsp of cream of tartar and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. I with held the urge to add cinnamon to the batter. There is no need with the streusel topping. I added a fresh vanilla bean only because I had them on hand. They look store bought. Yummie!!

Made these to the recipe.  25 minutes was not enough for large muffins so some batter was uncooked.  I baked the 2nd batch 35 minutes and they were perfect.  Great flavor and I liked the spice only in the  topping which let the apple flavo r shine.   Definitely a keeper.

I made these muffins for our Christmas breakfast this year and they were so delicious and pretty. I didn't chop the apples super small so you got chunky apples in each bite. Will definitely make these again. People were talking about them all day.

This recipe was amazing!  I changed it slightly so perhaps it should be 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 but I bet it would have been delicious regardless.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of apples (4 small empires), and added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the muffin body.  We are spice lovers so we like the very strong taste, however others may prefer the original recipe.

I made these muffins last night just as directions read and they are wonderful. The only thing I did not have on hand was the buttermilk so I just added two table spoons of vinegar to my one cup of milk and it worked out great. I will be making these again soon!!! Thanks!

I read previous reviews and decided to make them just as Jan had. And I'm glad I did. Okay, okay, I must confess I did grate the apples rather than dice but only because I was making mini-muffins.  Shredding seemed an easier tasks than dicing really really small pieces. (and of course reduced the baking time to 17 minutes instead of the full 25)  Thank you, Jan!

These muffins are amazing!!  My family goes crazy for them.  I have made them several times now.  The first time I made them exactly as written and they were perfect!  The next times I made them I used egg whites in place of whole eggs and half butter, half applesauce in place of the butter and they were just as amazing!  These changes were just to help keep my family a bit healthier, not because the original recipe needed editing.  The recipe makes more than 12, I get 18 or so.  Also the muffins do not rise too much, so fill up the cups a little higher than you normally do.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I really enjoy the taste, but they are a little fussy. Next time I will put the muffins in the oven for a little bit before I put the topping on. The mini muffins worked fine as is, but the topping sank right into the large muffins. I used muffin papers for both, but I would recommend spraying the top of your pan as well since they do tend to get a little stuck. Otherwise, very good as is.

The only changes I made in this recipe was to substitute 1 cup of wheat flour for A/P flour and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I also made it in a muffin top pan instead of a regular muffin pan.  They turned out wonderful.  Made 6 large muffin tops.

What a gorgeous muffin.  I was wary about filling the muffin tins to the top.  I even filled a little over - but they turned out beautiful.  
I did make changes because of what I had on hand and the other reviews.  I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of butter in the batter.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white in both the batter and topping.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 cup of milk and 2 tsp of vinegar.  I tossed the apples with 2 tsp white sugar and 1/2 tsp of vinegar.  I forgot to put in the vanilla.  They turned out great anyway!

**I also used white wheat flour to up the fiber content.

I'm giving this five stars despite the fact that I personally prefer an apple muffin with some spice: I added cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger.  I also tossed in some oatmeal to add fiber and flavor (and I made them with whole wheat).  It's an easy recipe to alter according to one's taste.  I use other apple muffin recipes regularly, and I'll add this one to my repertoire.

So good! These are excellent! They're moist and relatively good for you with the brown sugar. I added an extra cup or so of apples, and some cinnamon and nutmeg right into the batter.

These were really good. I ran out of white sugar so I used half white and half dark brown sugar for the batter and just skipped the topping, as I didn't know how the brown sugar would look/taste on top. Even without the topping, they were delicious, and very moist! I did add a little (about a tsp) of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I used granny smiths and diced them pretty small, as I made mini muffins and didn't want the apple chunks to be too large. I will definitely make these again.

I attempted to make these as a bread and it didn't quite work out. It lacked the structure to stay together. The flavor was fantastic though and I think as a muffin it would have held fine. Other than the change in pan I followed the recipe to a T.

These muffins are de-lish! They never last more than a day when i make them. They're good warm out of the oven, but the next day the bits of fruit turn them into a moist little bite from heaven! I reduce the butter in the crumb topping to make them easier to crumble.

Followed the recipe as written.  I was a bit concerned when I saw how thick the batter was before spooning it into the muffin tins, but they turned out great!!!  (very light, spongy, and not overly sweet) I doubled the recipe and made 12 large muffins and 24 minis.  The mini muffins took 16-18 minutes to cook.  Enjoy!

These are very good, a wonderful apple flavor.  But don't fill the muffin cups to the top, they will just overflow.

These were super delicious!  I adjusted the recipe only slightly by using a 1/4cup less brown sugar and adding no topping.  They were still sweet and full of appley goodness!

Ive never thought of putting apples in muffins before, but this recipe was amazing! I stuck to every ingredient and amount & they turned out perfect. For the topping I added a handful of quick rolled oats and it tasted like the crumble topping I make for my apple pies. Perfect. Thank you so much!!!! :)

Delicious! When I made them, they didn't turn out that well formed (which is completely my fault) but they tasted like heaven. MY family agreed, so they were gone soon. Definitely something to try, and very easy to bake

Great recipe: I added the cinnamon to the flour instead of the topping. I didn't want the cinnamon to over power the sweet buttery topping and in the muffin it hits the taste buds at the end of each mouth watering bite. Just like great apple pie should. I will enjoy this recipe for a long time....thanks !

When I made these, I added the 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and left out the crumb topping altogether. They were plenty sweet without it. They were moist and delicious. I got 24 muffins from one batch -- but since I just eyeballed the amount of apples, that may have made the difference. My two kids inhaled most of them within an hour or two of them coming out of the oven. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

Excellent!  These taste awesome!  They took a while to do but are very good.  I made mini muffins for my 2-year old son and normal size for me and my husband.  My son at 5 at his first sitting!

I tried this recipe this past weekend and am so pleased with the result.  I agree that you should at least try the recipe as intended at least once.  My only change was a substitution:  lacking buttermilk, I used a cup of lowfat sour cream instead.  The muffins are moist, flavorful and not too sweet.  An instant hit in my household.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

OMG taste SO much like Apple Pie! I will make these again and again! One important note...on my 2nd batch I was out of butter for the topping...and have to say...margarine does not make good crumb topping! Must use butter!

I made this recipe just the way it states above and they came out perfect! (OK wait, I made the buttermilk substitute by taking 1T white vinager and filling the rest of the cup with milk... let stand 5 minutes) I will definitely make these often!

I have never had a muffin taste even moister and yummier the next day! Great recipe. I only made a few changes for lack of ingredients on my part. I used almond milk rather than buttermilk and half margarine and half shortening to equal half cup. Also threw in about a third cup more apples. Don't add any spices to the muffin mix! The cinnamon amount in the topping is spot on and adds the perfect amount of flavor. Don't be shy with the topping I used almost all of it for the 12 muffins. 25 minutes was perfect time too!

Wonderful muffins!  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients to give a little more flavor and mixed lemon juice with skim milk since didn't have buttermilk on hand.  With my tins, it made 21 muffins. My daughter ate 2 as soon as they were cool enough to handle!  Definite keeper!

I looked for an apple muffin recipe after my 3 year old suggest we make apple muffins instead of blueberry muffins.  What a great idea.  I didn't even know there was such a thing.  duh.  I'm so glad he suggested it.  This recipe was so delicious and moist!  I added cinnamon to the batter bc I love cinnamon.  And for the streusel topping, I used maybe 3 TB butter rather than the 2TB called for.  I will definitely make again!

These were so scrummy!!!!!!! I had to reduce my bake time by about 8 minutes, though (my oven runs a little hot). This is my new favorite muffin recipe!

I love this recipe..  I didn't have enough brown sugar and so I used half sugar and half brown sugar and I think it was better!!!!  I have made this recipe about 3 times now and you can't go wrong..So easy...I used more apples, just a preference...This is probably one of the best recipes I have gotten of this site....Thank you Jan!!

These were good and I would have given four stars but I gave five because my teenage kids devoured them and raved about them.

I have been making these muffins for many years and it has become my "signature" muffin.  Everyone asks me to make them when they visit and I always do!!  Here's a great hint....they freeze beautifully and, in my opinion, are even better after they have been frozen as the topping softens up   Try these; you'll love them.

These are great muffins.  I made no changes to them and they are spectacular.  I was hesitant with all that sugar because I don't like overly sweet things but they aren't too sweet.  I think I will reduce the sugar in the topping though.  Really good muffin recipe.

My 17 year old son LOVES apple pie, so when I spotted this recipe, I knew I had to try it for him.  I used 2 granny smith apples so I did toss them in just a little white sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon before adding them to the mix.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  Well, I did have to use 1 cup milk + 1T lemon juice for the buttermilk.  The recipe yielded 15 muffins full to the top - paper liners kept them from sticking, but I think I'll only fill them 3/4 next time for easier storing.  I asked my son to rate them between 1-5, he answered... "20!!".  Needless to say - delicious!  Even my BF, who does not care for muffins, had a couple.  Update:  I froze half the batch so we could take a few out to enjoy now and then, and they were still great!  My son asks me to make these for him to take to social events.  Nice compliment.

Was a wonderful snow day breakfast treat!  I almost messed it up by only adding 2 tbls of butter instead of the 1/2 cup, and realized it after mixing, so I just threw it in and they still turned out WONDERFUL!  Used 1% milk because I didn't have buttermilk.  Best apple cinnamon muffins I've ever made.  They're beautiful too!

These are very good, as good as everyone else described. If you store them in a plastic bag they are just as moist and good three days later.

FANTASTIC! I used sucanat instead of brown sugar in the muffin and reduced it to 3/4 cup and used 3 cups of apples. WOW were these GREAT! Very moist, not overly sweet. Great recipe! I agree that adding extra cinnamon to the muffin batter would have been overkill. There was plenty of crumbs on top. Actually I usually double the crumbs for muffins, but with this recipe I didn't even use it all. This recipe is right on. Resist the temptation to make changes with this one!

If I could rate them 6 stars I would. Don't change a thing. These muffins are like BOOM! Amazing. They do compliment the apple flavor perfectly without being too sweet or bland. I doubled the batch to give away to some friends. This kept me from having to make breakfast for my husband a couple days, and these muffins make a perfect mid-day snack when warmed up for 15 seconds in the microwave.

LOVE IT!!!! I'm an American cooking (and living) in Europe and missing the smells and tastes of a Michigan autumn. I used dark brown sugar, because light brown sugar isn't available, I cut back 1/4 C on the brown sugar. I had 2 Granny Smith in the frig... it was plenty sweet and would definitely use G. Smith again. Also tried the suggestion of adding 1 tsp nutmeg and 1tsp into the base batter. PERFECT!!!! Baked 30 minutes at 190c. Husband's reaction was yumm over and over. It was perfect comfort food on a cold fall day so far from our American home. Thank you for the happiness!!!

I made this the other morning, and the muffins were a huge hit with my friends.  They were totally perfect-- not too sweet, just soft, cinnamon-y apple goodness.  I did modify the recipe a little.  Because I was planning on letting the batter sit in the fridge overnight (I wanted freshly baked muffins for breakfast!), I tossed the apple cubes in a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon before folding them into the mixture.  I'm not sure how the original recipe would have tasted, but we were all happy with my results!

This recipe is delicious as it is!  I have had such bad luck with muffins sticking in the muffin tins that I made it as a c offee cake - again, not changing anything in the recipe.  It worked perfectly in an 8.5 by 11 pan.

These are delicious muffins and the strudel is great on top.  Like the other reviewers suggested, I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  I also added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice.  I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour and they turned out great.

Very good recipe!!!  I made these muffins for Christmas morning and everyone seemed to like them.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg (1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg in the batter and 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg in the topping).  This worked out well, the muffins really did taste like apple pie (nobody touched the actual apple pie we bought).  Thanks for the recipe!
