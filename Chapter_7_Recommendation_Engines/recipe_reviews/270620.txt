I'm a HUGE fan of rhubarb, and love trying every type of rhubarb recipe I can get my hands on. This was quite tasty and a nice change from the usual, given the fact that Jell-O is used.  I think I would use a little less sugar next time. It's an excellent idea when you don't have fresh strawberries on hand but still want a strawberry flavor. The Jello-O unfortunately gives it an artificial taste and color, but otherwise a good recipe.

I had 5 cups of frozen rhubarb so i had to modify the recipe a little. After cooking the rhubarb with 1/4 cup sugar I added 2 small boxes of (sugarfree) strawberry jello. Google said a small box of jello equals 1-4 cup if sugar). The jam turned a beautiful reddish-pink. I ladled it into jars and the jam set up nicely. Thicker than applesauce but very easy to spread. Thanks for the recipe. I would have preferred more strawberry flavor but it is good and we will eat it.
