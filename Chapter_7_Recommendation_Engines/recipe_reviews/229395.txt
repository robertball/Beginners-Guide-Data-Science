Family loved it! I actually made them for a meal, so I used two whole crescents "sandwiched" with the meat in between (not rolled up). I also didn't have onion soup mix so I used Savory Garlic & Herb flavoring mix.

These were easy and tasty!  My son compared their flavor to a White Castle Burger.  I will make again!

Just had these for dinner tonight. I wanted to try them out before the holidays. Very, very good. I had two and my husband had six. YIKES! I gave them a four because they were so easy and had so few ingredients. Thanks for sharing naylor1234.

Fake White Castles!  These are delicious if you triple the ground beef.  We've made them for years with 1-1.5 lbs ground chuck, 1 packet of soup mix, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese & PICKLES!  I can't believe they don't have pickles in the recipe.  One dill pickle slice per sandwich.  You'll need 3-4 packages of rolls, depending on how much you stuff them.  They're always a big hit at tailgate or any other party.

Made these last night and the husband loved them. I did add some red chili powder to spice them up a bit. Roll these from the tip in to the rest of the dough and tuck in the edges. Next time, I would double the recipe because 8 is not enough!

I think an entire package dry onion soup mix is too much for 1/2 pound of ground beef.  Otherwise these are terrific.  I added a small amount of dill relish on top of the burger mixture.  Thanks!

Just made this recipe, super quick and easy! I did modify it a bit. I only put a mix of spices instead of the onion soup. And before cooking it, I sprinkled parmesan on the croissant dough! Super delicious. I used this as an appetizer, friends loved it as well!

This was supper tonight and all my picky teenagers loved it!  Reading the reviews I used almost 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef with the same amount of cheese and package of onion soup mix. I used 2 cans of crescent rolls.  I thought it sounded too simple and easy to be that good...I was wrong!  Always looking for something different to do with ground beef, this one is a winner!

Listened to other reviews and doubled the ground beef.  Even using a full pound the onion was still strong.  Used shredded Gouda cheese (it’s what we had on hand).  Also added sliced dill pickles and seasoned meat with our favorite, Mis Rubin’s Black Magic. Hubs liked it but we agreed that a half package of onion soup mix would be more than enough to add flavor but not overpower it.  We used two packages of crescent rolls, packed each with more than a tablespoon of filling and almost used all the mix. With some minor adjustments we will keep this one on file.  Super easy.

My family, especially my kids, loved this!  I doubled the recipe except for the onion soup mix.  It was perfect! My kids actually asked me to make it more and wanted to bring the leftovers for lunch at school.

The hubby LOVED this! I did chop up some pickles and I found some fake Big Mac sauce at Walmart and added it (and used it as dipping sauce also.) Will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome. My proportions: 1.25 lbs 93% ground beef, 2 cups finely shredded colby jack, 1 packet minus 1.5 tsp of lipton onion soup mix, and two packages of EXTRA LARGE crescent rolls (these are the 12 oz packages, not the 8 oz ones). Served with a salad, this served 4 hungry people with a few left over.

4 stars for easiness!  I doubled the recipe.  However, 2 packets of onion soup mix was a bit much, a tad too salty.  Even for me, and I love salt.  I think 1 packet would be fine.

My 7 year-old wouldn't touch it. "Too oniony" he said.  I love the idea and it was super easy- I think I used the wrong type of onion soup mix because it was overpowering. I will use this basic idea for future appetizers though.
