I couldn't find Ranch flavored croutons so I used garlic and herb flavored, and added some dry Ranch dressing to the mix. Also added a splash of the jalepeno juice too. Husband really enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was pretty good - I had to use a 12" cast iron skillet instead of a 9" so I used 4 eggs.  The croutons on the edge were a little too crunchy -  I think letting them soak a little longer would help with that.  I served this with sliced avocado and sliced tomatoes.  A chunky salsa would be good with it too.  BTW - this does not re-heat very well.
