I used 3 eggs when I made this and had no soy sauce on hand- so instead I used worstershire - and it was fine! (I know- I am as shocked as you are. The world didn't end!) I added celery, peas, carrots, sweet peppers, and asparagus - all chopped up super tiny. It was a lovely way to use a lot of leftover brown rice. This recipe seems so versatile and easy to expand (or contract).  Also- I used ground ginger- rather than fresh--- the result was a nicely spiced dish !

Family was thrown off by the sugar and the lime, personally, I love lime so it didn't bug me.  This rice is sweeter than I normally make it, given the teriyaki and added sugar.  If I do this again, those would be omitted/replaced with regular soy sauce.  Left out the peas as that is one of the few veggies we won't touch.  Thanks for a decent recipe!

Modified this a good bit -- for veggies, used fresh broccoli, green pepper and mushrooms, reduced the amount of sugar, used tamari instead of teriyaki (so no need to add extra salt), and threw in some extra red pepper flakes. After adding liquids, it was reducing too quickly to cook on its own, so I added veggies and rice right away; Not bad!

First time I made it = good
Each time I have made it after that = Best Ever!  
I like to put different veggies in each time. 
I want to try shrimp next time.

Best rice I've made so far! Put more veggies than called for but more is better in this case.

Great basic recipe!  I used soy sauce instead of teriyaki,  and no sugar.  2 eggs.  And a variety of chopped vegetables- what was on hand.

Next time I'd leave the lime juice out. It overpowered the other flavors.

Very delicious. Cooked the rice the evening before. I replaced the green onion for leeks. I really liked the texture, spices and vegetables. I was just a little too sweet for my taste. Maybe next time I would omit the brown sugar and use regular soy sauce instead of teriyaki.

It was pretty good. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cook the vegetables a bit earlier and add the rice afterward. The veggies seemed to be more raw than anything. Other than that, it was good rice.

This was really bland.  I had to add way more garlic, lime, and soy sauce.  I also added orange poppyseed dressing, which brought out a lot of flavors.  I might make it again but I would have to figure out the modifications.
