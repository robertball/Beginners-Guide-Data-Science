I love this recipe. Normally when I make it I add in some ground sausage and a bit of milk to thin it out. The Ro*Tel and Velveeta by itself is delicious though. Give it a go with a pound of ground sausage (I brown up spicy italian sausage as it adds a bit more of a spicy kick).

Old OLD recipe!  At the very least, you have to add the juice from the Rotel or some milk to make it not so thick!  I melt it all first, then add the liquids to thin to proper consistency.  I have also made some additions and improvements over the years: an 8 oz block of cream cheese, a large can of chopped mild green chilies, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp garlic powder or 2-3 cloves, crushed. SO GOOD!  A hit everytime!

Great basic recipe for Queso. I have used it many times. Some suggestions would be to add ground sausage, like some previous comments. I use chorizo, and a can of chopped chilis, or jalapeno to give it more of a kick, I have also used peppered velveta.

Great recipe as is but we like it doubled - 2 lb Velveeta, 2 cans Ro Tel - undrained, 1 can refried beans and 1 lb ground beef, browned and seasoned with s & p and cumin to taste. Even the "health conscious" members of the family can't walk away from the crock pot until it's empty. No, it's not real food but it's really good.

Really yummy! We had a smaller crowd than expected, though, and so I had some leftovers. Rather than let it go to waste, I decided to try making a cheese soup with it, and it worked great! I had used the mild Rotel tomatoes, and that was plenty spicy for me since I also also browned up and added some spicy sausage to the dip. To make the soup, I sauteed some onion, added the leftover cheese dip and a can of evaporated milk. Once it started bubbling, I threw in some frozen mixed veggies, and thought it still needed a little thinning so added some chicken broth. Delish!

The Rotel Cheese dip has been made by my household since the early 1970's.  Whenever my family would have a get together Rotel cheese dip would be made by someone.  During the early 1970's when my 3 sons were young they loved eating Rotel cheese dip w/Fritos.  Now days when I have my weekly Maj Jongg game Rotel cheese dip is always on our snack menu.  The microwave cooking time for my friends and I is usually 2 minutes, then stir and heat another minute or 2, but never 5 straight minutes.  If you microwaved the Rotel and cheese for 5 minutes you would end up w/a watery dip, and I don't know anyone who likes watery dips.

I love this recipe. It is frequently used in my home for get-togethers, just because, and to use in special dishes.  I like to mix it up by adding a pound of browned ground beef with 1 to 2 T of curry, or ground beef with a can of cream of mushroom, or a pound of cooked spicy chorizo, sometimes I add 1/4 C Franks Buffalo to give it a non-traditional kick with some shredded chicken, and I also use it for a "wet" burrito sauce, and sometimes I use it in enchiladas, and for king ranch casserole. But I have to say my favorite way is just the simple two ingredient mix of Ro*Tel and Velveeta and some nice salty tortilla chips.

Like many others I've made this dip for what seems like forever. It's very popular in our part of the country and it's always a good ol' standby favorite. One variation that I make is to add a can of chili (no beans) which makes a great chili cheese dip. Nothing could be easier!

This recipe is a classic! I make this all the time during foorball season. When I do I always double the recipe, add hot italian sausage and here is the best part... we always have leftovers... about half. So the next day I heat up the leftovers with a little butter and milk and add cooked cellentani pasta, top with mexican 4 cheese blend and bake. Most delicious macaroni and cheese I can remember.

I am not a big fan of processed cheese but my aunt gave me some free and I had a work crew to feed one weekend on our roof project ... this was awesome, easy, and delicious.  The guys (and gals) all loved it!! I made it per the recipe, no changes.

Velveeta now makes a queso cheese. It's even better than the regular. I like it with half and half. It's even better with breakfast sausage it it.

I love doing this for college football season Saturdays (I think the Ro-tel commercials on the B1G Network a couple of years ago caused that association :-) Delicious hot, still tasty warm; I go through a ton of chips when we make this dip!

This recipe has been in my family for years. It's a universal recipe in that, the heat is acceptable to most people - not too hot, yet spicey snoufgh for those who like heat. Simple and quick  to make. I have never tried it with the lower fat version of Velveeta and would be interested in knowing how that works if anyone has tried it.

For a good variation for those who like the Skillet Queso dip that some restaurants do, mix this in with taco seasoned ground beef. Makes for a great dip!

This was really enjoyed by my kids and their friends.  I browned some ground pork (was on hand but any ground meat will do) and diced onion.  I drained a can of "mild" RoTel thinking it may curdle the cheese but it may not have been necessary.  I used the new, Jalapeno variety of Velveeta.  It was a little thick and perhaps not draining the RoTel would have been better.  I added a little milk for a lighter dipping consistency. This (by our standards) was not spicy but it was just right for those who didn't like too much heat.  Will no doubt make this again.

We've used this recipe for years as written--so easy and delicious. Sometimes I brown hamburger and add taco seasoning as if I were going to make tacos, and add that to the dip, which is also delicious.

This recipe is basic but so good! You can do so much with it! It’s perfect as is. However, if you want to make it a bit spicer you can add in a jar of chopped jalapeños.

It tasted fine. The problem is the consistency changes as it cools and you have to be aware to add liquid and reheat. I'm guessing if your party eats it at once it'll be fine but, during Superbowl, it became annoying to babysit the queso. I'll  stick with my artichoke & spinach dip which did much better.

This was a fabulous appetizer dip and was a hit at our gathering.  Instead of microwaving, though, we warmed up the mixed ingredients in a mini crockpot.  Turned out great!

Very tasty, Very Salty. Try to get low salt cheese if you can.  I have only made this with meat, usually sausage. You can find healthy versions of sausage or season cooked ground meat.

Very good. I added ground beef and jalapeños to give it a thicker, spicier kick. It was amazing and a real crowd pleaser.

I’ve made this recipe many times. I have to admit it’s a lot better if you melt the cheese down in a sauce pan and transfer it into a mini crockpot. Also i use two cans of Rotel instead and it’s much better. Once we had only had one can so I used a partial can of green enchilada sauce and the dip came out even more amazing.

I just got through making this quick and easy queso, I added along with the Rotel: diced onions, a little bit of black pepper, some butter, and a little evaporated milk, I used the Velveeta Mexican shredded cheese did pretty good, was good with some tortilla chips

Very popular with guests and quick and easy to boot.  I used the microwave method and served it in the bowl I heated it in.

I have been making this forever, and it's an all-time favorite!!  I agree that it's great with just the two ingredients, and you can use it in a zillion ways.  Adding the ground sausage kicks it up a notch, especially if you use hot sausage.  Try it, you can't screw it up, and everyone will love it!!!

One of my all-time favorites!  I use the low-fat Velveeta.  Great as a dip and over cooked cauliflower!

I've been making this since highschool. (35+ yrs) Microwaving it makes it so much easier on medium. Rotel and Velveeta have come up with spicier versions now too. My husband makes this for himself for watching Sunday NFL games, he calls it "his personal tailgating food"....chuckles

Always a great recipe.  For a change my niece used pepper jack cheese instead of Velveeta--outstanding.

Yummy and quick, I always keep cooked sausage in the freezer so I throw that in and it almost makes it a meal!  This is a keeper!

We've been making this forever.  You can't watch a football game on Sunday afternoon without it!  It's much easier to make these days now that you can microwave it.  Either way, it's a great dip to serve with Fritos or Scoops.
