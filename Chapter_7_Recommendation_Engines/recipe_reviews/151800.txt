Way to sweet for my taste.  I would double the stuffing and 1/2 the rest...or just eat stuffing the way it is without all the extra fat/calories.  Sorry.

Excellent! Easy to make and a great way to avoid dry boring stuffing.

I did this last year and the only thing I modified is a pinch of Cayenne Pepper to make it spicy sweet. It was delicious! All my family SNARFED it and were practically licking their plates clean. Yummy, yummy!

I made a variation of this as a meal. Pre-heat oven to 425. Brown  1lb maple sausage;  add 3 thin sliced stalks of celery, 1/4 chopped sweet onion, and 3 pats of butter to the pan reduce heat to low and cover. When onions weep, add 1 lb bag of frozen loose leaf spinach cover and leave on low/warm to thaw spinach.  Mix a regular box of stuffing with 1-2/3 cup of HOT  water & 4 pats of butter... Put to the side.  Mix 2 boxes of Jiff Corn Bread mix as instruction.  take a 9Ã—13 pan spray with nonstick canola.  Take sausage and spinach mixture off heat and add to 9x13 pan.  Layer stuffing on 9x13. Add Cornbread Batter to top of 9x13 pan and slightly mix into the layers.  Add 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar to top of 9x13 pan.  Place 9x13 pan in oven for about 15 min.  Serve warm.

Nothing to rave about. It was okay. I ended up deciding to bake mine...we like ours a little less wet.
