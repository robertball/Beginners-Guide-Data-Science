Good mix of ingredients, however, if you change the serving size to 3 and it calls for 2 chicken breasts, this part of step 3 is irrelevant: Pour in broth, ensuring chicken is just covered in liquid.

1 cup of broth does NOT "cover" 2 chicken breasts. Mine turned into a soup because I added enough to cover it. Not super flavorful either but maybe its because of the changing in serving size...

This came out well. The chicken was tender, and the beans were a great addition.  I used all green bell pepper  as that's what I had. Also, I used 1 cup salsa in place of 1 cup chicken broth-- I make a similar recipe all the time, and thought this would help with flavor. Even with the salsa added, I thought this still needed a bit more flavor-- the taco seasoning in this recipe could probably use some garlic powder and a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  We used this for chicken soft tacos, and everyone liked them.
