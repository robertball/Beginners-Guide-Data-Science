I will rate it as suggested.  If i make a zillion changes I just posted my own recipe which is actually very rude.  Lets face it.  We all love to cook and tweak things.  Be respectful to the poster and evaluate her recipe as written.  Don't say how much better you make it because you're a more creative cook... Would you like that?!  I will never post an original recipe on here..lol.

This was a big hit with the following additions:  added 1# Jimmy Dean regular sausage, 4 eggs instead of 3, 3/4 C buttermilk, 8 slices of crisp bacon crumbled, 1 cup of Mexican 4 cheese and some sharp cheddar.

Yum, Yum!  Made as directed and it came out perfect! I I added the topping 5 mins before taking from the oven. It was nice and crisp! Served with a side of fruit (bananas & strawberries and buttermilk biscuits.  My family loved it.  I will double the recipe in the future and experiment with other meats & cheeses in addition to the bacon & mozzarella.  This recipe is a winner!

Delicious! Made as written, but did add dried Italian herbs for our personal taste. It is going into our monthly rotation!

I also added hot Jimmy Dean sausage and used 4 eggs instead of 3. I browned the sausage and onions together. Don't add any salt, the sausage adds plenty. The crunchy onion topping they are referring to comes in the package, just FYI.  This is great but quite rich and savory, I would suggest serving with some fruit.

It was tasty but came out really dry. Likely would have been done at 15-18 minutes at 450. Will tweak it and make it again! My oven is on temp, I use an oven thermometer.

This was great - no leftovers!  I did what a few others suggested - used four eggs instead of three, and checked it after it baked for about 18 minutes.  It was done - 25 minutes would be too long.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was surprisingly delicious!! The whole family loved it.  I made it with sausage per the other comments. I love that there are just a few ingredients. I will definitely make this again.
