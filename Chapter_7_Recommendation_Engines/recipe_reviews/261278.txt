I have made this several times, although I have adapted it slightly. Not a big fan of mustard, I omit the honey mustard as well as the pepper. I have also lowered the temperature to 400° and started the sweet potato and sausage, giving them a head start before adding the apple. If you don't, I assure you that the apple will be cooked to mush when the sweet potatoes are finally ready. [And to be precise, I also use yams instead of sweet potatoes]. I add the apple when the yams yield to a fork and are within approximately 15 minutes of being done. I like my yams to be soft while allowing the apple to retain a little firmness, and since the apple is softer it takes much less time to cook. I also vary the seasoning, using McCormick's Greek seasoning. Although not what one might not consider a breakfast dish, I have served this to company,  with many compliments, for breakfast, lunch and dinner and feel that it makes this adaption easily. With the changes I've mentioned, I would give this between a 4 and 5 star rating.

This could have been good but whoever wrote the instructions and suggested 45 to 55 minutes was way off. I went with 45 to be on the safe side. Way overcooked. Apples were sauce and the sweet potatoes were dried out. Threw the leftovers away. I don't think I will make it again.

Made as recipe was outlined but doubled the amount and used honeycrisp apples.  If I make again, will cover the pan with foil for 30 mins, then uncover to brown for 10.  This seemed like a high temperature for the type and amount of food.  Also, I liked the honey mustard sauce but added a bit more because it was so yummy!

My husband and I both liked this but we agreed that the chicken apple sausage didn't add much.  Perhaps sweet Italian sausage as another reviewer used might be more flavorful.  It was a little dry, so perhaps a little more mustard would help.  It smelled delicious as it was baking!

I substituted kielbasa for the chicken sausage, added two chopped onions to the recipe. Omitted the honey mustard and seasoned with a drizzle of good EVOO, salt, pepper, tsp of fennel seed, and a squeeze of fresh orange juice and a tsp of brown sugar on the apples.  Baked at 400 F for 1 hour and added the apples after the potatoes were fork tender for another 15 minutes. Seeded mustard on the side. Easy and tasty.

I turned it down to 400 and cooked it for 30 minutes with foil, then another 15 without. The potatoes were perfect but when I make it next time, I’ll probably wait to put the apples in later.

This was awful. The potatoes were hard as rocks and the apples turned to mush. No, I will not make it again!

This was good. Chicken apple sausage was a bit bland for my taste so the second time I used sweet Italian sausage. Oven temp was too high; my first time it burned. Set it for 410 the second time and it was better - took about 40 minutes. Because the combination of flavors is so good next time I'm going to cut the apples and sweet potatoes into smaller pieces so I can get all three flavors in one bite.

I followed the recipe exactly as written though added a little extra honey mustard to match the large quantity. A lot of effort dicing sweet potatoes for just a so-so dish. Husband didn t care for it either.

Chopped the ingredients in about 10 minutes and put it in the crockpot to cook for about 3 hours.  Yum!  Turned out very well.  Good camper meal.
