Very good cookie recipe.  Batter holds together well and cookies bake nicely.  Looks very festive with holiday candies.

So far they seem great (they are still warm from the oven)! I added Reese's Pieces as the candy. And I used a mixture of dark and light brown sugar. They were done in my oven after 6 minutes. They brown quick! Glad to have found a peanut butter recipe that didn't require shortening or chilling for 2 hours! I needed these cookies quick! I will make them again soon!

Not a bad recipe - easy to throw together and a great use for those extra candy-coated mini chocolates from Christmas baking.  I think I'd use a little bit more peanut butter than called for, but they're a nice cookie. I suspect perhaps JILLZY007 may have over-baked them?  I find them a nice chewy/soft consistency, even when cooled.  I'd do it again.

The cookies were easy to make & also very nice sized servings. My only addition to this recipe is for anyone with Gas ovens. The first dozen I put in burned quickly when I waited 10 mins to check them. If you have a gas oven start checking them about 7 mins into the baking if oven is preheated.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Instead of candy bits, I just used a cup of chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful! Much better than the last batch I made using a recipe from this site! My hubby loves them!! I'll definitely make these again!

Very good cookie, they made nice cookies in small, big, and even a couple hand-span sizes (just make sure to flatten slightly so the middle is done when the edges are). I was envisioning a lighter peanut butter flavor, almost like a hint, but I could definitely taste it in there. I would make these again, the peanut flavor and crunchy-coated candy pieces made it fun.

Great cookie! I'm baking like crazy to freeze some individually wrapped packs of cookies etc for school lunches.  These cookies fit the bill perfectly!  They are very chewy even when cooled.  I'll definately make more.  Hope my family doesn't find the stash in the freezer, or I'll be making them again REALLY soon.

The cookies turned out a little dry and crumbly.  Will try for a better recipe.
