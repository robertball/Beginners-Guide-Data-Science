I have used this recipe for literly years!!  I too am from MN and LOVE wild rice.  It is hard to get in NV, but friends from MN have connections.:) It is my husband's absolute favorite salad. Whenever I make it, I get rave reviews!

I made this for my family last week and everyone loved it!  The cashews really added a nice crunch.  If you like wild rice, you will enjoy this recipe.

I don't like water chestnuts, so I omitted them and used more grapes and chicken.  It was wonderful.  I was worried it would lack flavor, but it was just fine.

Needs more mayo.  I didn't measure but I probably doubled the mayo and it was definitely not "wet."  The cashews are great in this.  We did not like the water chestnuts.  Could use a little salt and more grapes.  Good.

Fantastic side dish which compliments any type of poultry or pork.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.  The next day, we added leftover chopped pork tenderloin for a light lunch.  Delicious!

I found a precooked wild rice here in Nevada at the local Trader Joe's.  Worked great and cut all that time off.  Was great served it on whole wheat crackers.

I think this was a good base recipe but it needed a little more flavor. I probably added another cup of grapes, tossed it with the mayo but then added another 3/4 c. of greek yogurt (next time ill do the whole thing with greek yogurt), 1 c. green onion, dash of garlic powder, salt, & pepper
