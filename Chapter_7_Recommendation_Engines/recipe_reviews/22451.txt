Just to add a note, about this fantastic bread, 18 TBS is 1 cup + 2 TBS....
18 TBS is just time consuming.  But sure can't beat the bread.

Fresh out of the bread machine, this bread is absolutely delicious.  The only drawback to the recipe, is the measurement for the water.  It would be easier if it were converted to the standard measurement of 1 cup and 2 tablespoons.

just cut into our loaf from this recipe.. beautiful on the light setting and quite lovely in the crumb.  My machine runs two raises and then a proof run so i did not stop it and reset.  Used King Aurthur unbleach bread machine flower and corn oil.. no other changes... came out divine.  Lots of flavor.  If you start out with GOOD flour you get good bread.  Thanks!

I'm a first time bread maker and this came out great. I bake mine in the oven 350 for 25mins and it is perfect. This makes incredibly yummy grilled cheese sandwiches. Update: hubby gave me a Breadman breadmachine for my bday. I set it to basic loaf on rapid for crust setting. My machine has 3 rise cycles so I take the dough out just as it goes into the 3rd rise and form it in breadpan. Let rise again and bake as above. Done in about 2hrs with no problems. I do use about 3 cups of flour and probably a 1/4 tsp more yeast. I make this about every other day and my daughters hover around the oven waiting for their treat.

I got this off Allrecipes about four years ago and have been using it ever since. It is perfect. Has become traditional for me to make everyone a loaf at Thanksgiving to have their leftover turkey sandwiches on. I use the easier measurment of 1 cup + 2 tablespoons for the water.

My bread machine sat unused until I found this recipe.  Now my kids tell me to not buy bread at the store anymore.  They want me to make this bread.  I have also given out loaves to neighbors and those neighbors told other neighbors about how good it was.  Great bread recipe

Amazing!  I make this bread by hand using the following instructions: 1) Allow the yeast and the sugar to hang out in the warm water for 10 minutes 2) Add all the other ingredients and knead for less than or equal to 15 minutes.  Kneading is complete when the dough is no longer sticky and it recoils slightly when you indent it with a finger.  3) Place dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise for 1-1.5hrs (I put the bowl in the oven, unheated, b/c my house is cold/drafty) 4) Punch the dough down and knead it for 1 minute 5) Place dough in a greased 9x5 loaf pan, cover with a towel, and let rise for 45 minutes 6) Bake at 350ÂºF for 25 minutes (crust should sound hollow at the end of baking)

This is great bread. My new everyday white bread recipe has been found!!! First time I made it the dough was very, very sticky and came out with a weird texture. So, the next time I added one extra tablespoon of bread flour. I mixed it in my bread machine (mine has two rise cycles) and then took it out, kneaded in one tablespoon bread flour and let it do the final rise in my bread pan for 55 minutes. I then baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. This bread is so delicous. Thank you!

This bread was what supermarket white breads strive to be. I was surprised at the softness of the crust.  Usually I don't care for the crust of bread machine loaves but this one was awesome!  My four year old daughter helped my make this so it is definately kid friendly and my eight year old son asked me to make this again instead of buying supermarket bread. I'd say that says it all.

I tried something different with this recipe and it didn't work too well.  I did it on the dough cycle and baked it in the oven.  I guess I didn't bake it long enough because the center was doughy.  I outer pieces had a wonderful flavor.  I am trying it again now and will bake it in the bread maker.

This bread is delicious! Although we made a few times, it ALWAYS turned out small and very dense in the breadmaker. 

I increased the flour to 3 cups and the yeast to 1 1/4tsp, it then doubled in size and turned out perfect! I turn on the basic setting, light crust, and 1.5 loaf.

Finally a keeper!

I was delighted with this recipe but since I made some changes, my review is on the recipe with comments on my changes:

First, I substituted the bread flour for all purpose and used 3 cups all purpose flour. Seconds, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast. Third, I made this bread by hand. Fourth, I mixed all the dry ingredients together and warmed up the water to 125 F - 130 F degrees and then added with the oil to the dry mix.

I am though, very careful and make sure that the water is exactly 130 F degrees and no more. I use a candy thermomether for this.

I used the measurement for water mentioned: 3/4 cup plus 2 Tab. I needed to add 1 more Tab. The dough should feel soft and a little bit sticky. When you touch it, slight traces of dough should remain in your hand. Make sure that you knead that dough well if you make this recipe by hand folding the corners towards the center of the dough and punching down with your knucles. 5 minutes of this should do.

I turned on the oven to 200 f for 2-5 minutes and turned off to get oven ready for rising. I then made the first rising cycle by brushing lightly all the dough with oil and covering with a towel on a glass bowl. The second rise was done  after punching down and kneading the dough some more,in the baking pan with non-stick oil on it and covering with the towel again. I baked at 350 F for 25 - 30 min.

This bread has a very soft and evenly brown crust. :-)

I don't have a bread maker, so I followed the comments of some of the other reviews and did it in my oven. I used 3 tsp of yeast, dissolved in the warm water for about 10 minutes or so, and 3 cups of flour. Mixed everything up, let it rise for about 30 minutes, kneaded it and let it rise again for 30 minutes, then put it in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees. So simple and SO tasty!

I make a batch of this bread almost every day.  It is so simple, and so so good!  I have always made the dough in the bread machine and then baked in the oven.  The only problem I had was that the dough made one really big loaf, or two small loaves that weren't quite big enough for sandwiches.  I experimented with the amounts of ingredients to come up with a dough that would make two normal sized loaves.  I changed it to 1 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp salt, 4 cups all purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsp yeast.  I bake my loaves in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.

This bread is AWESOME!  I don't have a bread machine - I made it the old fashioned way.  I did take the tip to use 3 cups bread flour and 1 1/4 tsp of yeast.    Kneed for 10 minutes, let rise for 1.5 hours.  Punch down and roll out to 8" x 7".  Roll bread, tucking seam underneath, let rise for another 30 minutes and bake for 30 minutes.  Absolutely wonderful.  I have completely stopped buying bread now.  I just make a loaf a week.

I made this bread using my big stand mixer, adding the ingredients in the order given.  I doubled the recipe and living at a high altitude, I added 3/4 cup flour, increased the yeast by 1/2 teaspoon and the water by 1/4 cup. After placing it in 2 large bread pans for final rise, I baked it at 350* for about 25 minutes.  I have tried at least 10 different recipes for white bread, and this one is absolutely the best I've tried. My husband and sons just loved it!!

Very Easy!!! I don't have a bread machine so I used my Kitchen Aid mixer. I converted the measurements to grams because I think it is faster and easier to make in the future. I just set the mixing bowl on the scale and then zeroed it out to add the next ingredient. I also proofed the yeast in the water before I mixed it all up.   345 grams of flour 57 grams of oil 4 grams of yeast 50 grams of sugar 3 grams of salt 270 grams of water   I did have to add more flour once I started to mix it up. I just let it raise in the mixer then let it rise for 30 minutes. Then I flipped the mixer on again for a few minutes. Let the dough rise again for 30 minutes. Then kneaded the dough for a few minutes and put in a greased bread pan covered and let it rise for 30 more minutes. Then baked for 25 minutes. It was SO tasty. We ate the whole loaf in 3 hours.

The best white bread recipe...ever!!!!  Nice texture and great flavor, easy to make.  I changed the recipe to 16 servings to fill my 2 lb. bread maker to capacity; worked perfectly.  The second rise was built in so I  skipped that step.  The only thing I did differently was let the sugar, water and yeast proof alone for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.

totally yummy. I don't have a bread machine, but that no problem, I just mixed my ingredients, let the dough rise in  a warm place, put it in my bread pan, let it rise again and then baked it for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees. I made it yesterday, it's already gone, Making another loaf today.

After reading a bunch of reviews, I noticed that there were some different measurements being thrown out for the cup equivalent of 18 Tbs.  I looked it up, there are 4 Tbs. to a 1/4 cup, so 18 Tbs. = 1 cup + 2 Tbs.

Fantastic!!!  I used King Arthur bread flour and a tablespoon of yeast as I like a more yeasty bread.  It had a great crumb and was nice & soft.The taste was terrific.

It has been quite ahile since I made bread complety by hand ( no bread machine) but this recipe is so easy. It has a very nice texture with that hint of sweetness. I made 3 loaves kept 2 and shared the 3rd here at work. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good BUT I must warn you - the review with the most helpful nods is incorrect! 18 tablespoons = 1C + 2 tablespoons - NOT the 3/4 C + 2 tbsp that it says. 16 tbsp = 1 cup. I stuck to recipe but used bread machine yeast - you just use 80% or 1/5 less than 1 tsp in that case - but it doesn't really matter anywhere between that and 1 tsp is fine. DO NOT heat your water if you're using a bread machine, room temp is suggested for 99% of machines - and most machines suggest putting wet ingredients on bottom, dry on top, and making a well in the middle of the dry for the yeast.

This is the perfect bread recipe. I've been baking bread as my new 'hobby' for several months now, experimenting with many recipes, and in the end, if I follow this one exactly (other than I omit the sugar completely since I don't like sweet bread)....it turns out perfectly each time. Make sure you use a good strong bread flour, pure salt, and I even use extra virgin olive oil. Preheat your oven first.  Oh, and I don't cover the dough when rising. Since it has an oil coat from the bowl, it doesn't dry out and I don't have to fiddle with oiled cling film or risk my dough deflating.  Also, I only bake one of the loaves. I put the dough for the other loaf in an oiled ziploc bag after the kneading process and toss it in the freezer. To bake it, I just pop it out the freezer, put it in the bread pan, and let it rise in warm area. (I brush frozen loaf with oil and don't cover).  It takes awhile to defrost and then rise, but it will eventually rise BEAUTIFULLY.  Preheat and bake. We haven't bought bread from the baker or grocery store since finding this recipe.

After trying several bread recipes I found this one to be the best for making the perfect sandwich bread.  I double the recipe and it makes 2 big loaves. Everyone who has this bread can't believe how good it is. The kids love it and even eat the crust.  I do not use a bread machine but use standard bread making procedures and it comes out great.  Proof the yeast for 5 minutes with a little sugar, mix in the rest of the ingredients then knead for 10 minutes. I let it rise covered for 1 hour in a greased bowl then punch down and form two big loaves and let rise for another hour in bread pans or until doubled in size.  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes.

What a wonderful, easy bread recipe.  I made 4 loafs the first time, each one perfect.  Gave two away.  What a hit.  Try toast or french toast for a real treat.  Thanks.

I made this bread yesterday for the first time. I followed it exactly, but i baked it in my bread machine on the basic setting, light crust. it turned out perfect. so good and excellent texture. Perfect to make sandwiches for the kids lunches. I will keep using this on a regular basis rather than buy bread. nice!

great texture and flavor :)  18 tablespoons = 1 cup + 2 tablespoons - makes it a little quicker to measure.

This bread CAN be made without a breadmaker! To adjust, simply mix the dry ingredients and oil in a bowl. Add yeast to the warm (110-115 degree water) and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, add the water and yeast to the flour mixture. Mix together by hand, then turn out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, adding flour as needed. Place in greased bowl, cover and put in warm place to rise for about an hour. (I preheat my oven at 250 for about 5 minutes then turn off and use this as my "warm place"). After the first rise, punch it down and let rise again. After second rise (about 45 minutes with quick rise yeast), punch down again, put in greased bread pan, let rise for another 20 mins and then bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  Rub your tummy and say "yum yum!" My family LOVED this and I will make it again and again.

Mmm! This bread is good! All I did was put the ingredients in and let it run through it's regular cycle. So very good! It smelled wonderful, so as soon as it was done we cut into it. It lasted about 5 minutes. I'm off to make another loaf right now!

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  It's not my favorite, but it's a good go-to.  I also like that it doesn't require a lot of yeast.

*I'd like to add that 18 tablespoons is 1 cup + 2 tbsps.  A previous review incorrectly identified it as 3/4 cups.

This bread has a really nice flavor!  All my usual bread machine recipes call for butter, and since I had none left, I needed a recipe for bread that used oil.  This bread has a really nice soft texture.  I put mine on the dough cycle, so I could take it out and make dinner rolls.  I wouldn't recommend doing this though, because the dough is very sticky, and I ended up adding a lot more flour to make it manageable.  In the end though, after the extra kneeding, I had a dozen very delicious rolls! I'm going to try this again today, and let it stay in the machine to bake. Thanks Sherry Ann, for a good recipe.

Came out perfect!  Nice and light and fluffy and moist.  I did bake it in the oven no problem.  Had to put foil on the top halfway through so the top wouldn't burn.  It rose quite a bit!

I scaled recipe for 6 servings. As my bread machine can only take 1 1/3 cups of bread flour.  I just made this recipe and waiting for the bread to cool a bit.  Rose beautifully!  I, did, however used 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast total, ( what my bread machine recommends on breads).  Instead of canola oil, used vegetable oil.  RESULTS:DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  This recipe is a KEEPER, thanks for sharing.

I couldn't get this to really rise in my bread machine. I am going to blame it on the machine though, as I couldn't get another loaf to do the same and I used good yeast, but my machine is 7 years old! From what was decent of the loaf it was good with butter and would be great with pb & j or as a breakfast bread. Although, I thought it had a little bit of a sweet bite for a meat and cheese type sandwich.

Turned out awesome!  I was looking for an alternative recipe for the oat bread I usually make and this turned out great!  I brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled it with sunflower and poppy seeds and a mixture of grains.

I have no idea what went wrong with mine. Followed the directions exactly. After the first kneading it looked pretty soupy, but after the second kneading the consistency was fine. The end product was short and thick, despite using new yeast. Will try again another day.

I used this recipe to make challah bread for my vegan roommate.  I adapted it a little so it would be more similar to the challah I usually make--I substituted honey for sugar and used a combination of whole wheat and white flour.  This bread was delicious and moist.  Thank you for giving me a vegan alternative to my normal bread recipe!

This is my first time EVER bothering to rate a recipe anywhere on the net - but I really wanted to this time! I am on my 3rd bread machine in about 15 years and this is BY FAR thee best recipe I have used. I use more flour about 3 cups, other than that I follow it to the letter and it is perfect every time.  I have tried altering it with some whole wheat flour, raisins, wheat germ etc. with not so great results,; but AS IS it is wonderful! Today I am going to try removing dough and shaping and baking in the oven.

Best ever bread I have made in over 20 years of baking bread. I tried Best for bread flour Wholewheat and the bread is fantastic. I will be using Wholewheat flour from now on as is alot healthier for the family. I just use dough cycle and after its done I let rise for an hour and put in oven. I use 9 x 5 bread pan. My wholewheat bread recipe looks just like the picture. Not bad for just switching flour.

Wonderful recipe! I made this in my bread machine twice today. Followed the recipe exactly. The first time I set the machine for a 2 pound loaf for a light crust (3 hours total). It was a bit under baked. The second time, I set it for a 1-1/2 pound loaf for a medium crust (3 hr, 10 min) and it was perfect. I've never liked how the bread from the machine comes out with a hole in the bottom so next time, I may process this in the machine then bake in a loaf pan in the oven. Definitely a keeper!

Best loaf of bread that i have made in my bread machine. I did not stop the cycle, i just let the machine do its thing, since it has 2 rise cycles. I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the bread flour. Delicious and easy.

This is the best loaf of bread that I have made in my bread machine.  I didn't do the step where you stop it.  I just hit start and let it go to the end and it turned out perfect. Also 1 cup equals 16 tbsp.  So I used 1 cup plus 2 tbsp. in lieu of measuring out 18 tbsps and it worked great.  This is our new "white bread" recipe for our machine.  We love it!

This is amazingly good bread.  I made it as written the first time but I wanted a bit denser texture.  Next time I tweaked it a bit & it came out perfectly as I'd envisioned.  My changes were:  used 1/3 c oil instead of 1/4; scant 3 cups bread flour; 1 tsp salt; and upped the sugar by 2 Tbs. (3/8 c instead of 1/4 c).  Probably another significant change was I set my bread machine on the RAPID setting (a shorter rise time) & I also used the Large loaf setting (really wasn't sure if this makes a small or large loaf).  The texture of this bread came out so incredible!  Firm, moist, yet not underdone in the least with a perfect crust.  After baking in the machine, I let it set out overnight (I live in a desert climate); then sliced it with my electric knife the next morning & took it in to work.  My co-workers had it gobbled up in no time.  Fabulous with honey butter & makes wonderful toast as well.  I think I'll be making this bread for a long time to come.  I hope to get brave & try a loaf in the oven one of these days.  Thank you ShooseyQ for this amazing recipe!

Awesome bread.  Love the flavor. I usually make this for when we have soup, i love dipping it in the soup.  I always prepare the dough in my bread maker and put it in a loaf pan to bake (letting it rise again of course)  I do agree with others that the 18 TB of water is strange, it's easier to say 1 cup plus 2 TB instead.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe ShooseyQ!

Sooooo Easy and Very Good! It was a little sweet for me at first compared to the cheap store bread that I use to buy. But it is rich in flavor and when it is toasted it is even more amazing.

Eh - just ok.  Rather bland in my opinion.  Try the milk bread recipe on this site and you'll be likely to not try the Amish recipe again!

not as sweet as I had hoped with so much sugar but still very moist and soft. Baked in my machine on the sandwich setting -- came out perfect. Also seemed to do well on delay timer.

Ok, I made some PHENOMENAL changes to this without ever making it as the recipe says to, but holy bread... it was good.  I put 1/8 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup brown sugar in stead of the white sugar and whole milk instead of water.  The dough was pretty sticky in the bread machine but I added bread flour a table spoon at a time until it was the right consistency.  I'm telling you, this bread was good.  Sweet, but very very good.

The bread was great the directions were irritating.  Seriously, who say 18 TBSP?    I also, by mistake, learned that you do not need to run this through your bread machine for two full raising cycles.  Both my breads turned out exactly the same, soft, fluffy and delicious.  You cannot even tell a difference.

This makes a beautiful loaf of slightly sweet bread, my first loaf was overworked and didn't rise very much, but still tasted great.  The second loaf I used 3 cups flour and 1/4 teaspoon more yeast and got a larger loaf.  This is definitely my white bread of choice from now on!

I LOVE this bread and so does the family.  I'm not much of a bread machine lover.  So I run it through the rising cycle.  Then, punch down, need slightly, and place in bread pans to rise again before baking in oven.  Works great.

I needed a quick loaf of bread and found this recipe. I mixed 3 cups of bread flour in my Artisan with a little more than 1 tsp of yeast. After mixing I kneaded the dough for 10 minutes and let it rise for an hour in a greased bowl. I punched it down lightly and just streached and letter folded the dough about three times and let it rise until it just about doubled again and folded it again and put it in a greased pan and let it proof for about 30 minutes. I baked for 5 minutes in at 500* to get a good spring and then turned the temperature down to 350* and baked for about 20 more minutes. The loaf was about 202* inside and looked just like the photo that VW took. Tasted great and had a nice crumb. I'll be making more of this bread for sure! Thanks ShooseyQ!

I made this bread today and it is very good.  My bread maker is higher capacity (2, 2 1/2 or 3 lb. loaves) so I increased the serving size to 18 to make a bigger loaf using the online calculator and figured it would be an experiment if it came out ok.  It did come out ok, and made a nice big tall, loaf that is delicious.  Thank you for the recipe, it is a keeper!  This is so much better than store bought bread!!

I have found the bread recipe I have been searching for!  Phenomenal!  Perfect!  I just dump it all in the machine and use the Basic Bake setting and it comes out perfectly.  It can't be any easier than that and I know what is going in my family's mouths!  Awesome!

Atee is wrong. 18 T is not 3/4 cup + 2 TBS. 18 T is 1 cup + 2 TBS. Anyway, this the the best white bread recipe. Its the only one I'll ever use for now on. Bread flour really helps this bread to rise a lot. Only changes I made is I used warm milk instead of water and butter instead of oil.

Oh my, I have been making this bread for a few months now and realized I never reviewed it.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!  I make this bread twice a week, we cant get enough of it. I did make a slight change.  The flour I use is 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white.

This turned out great. I made a slight modification to it though. I let my bread machine mix and knead it, and let it go through two rise cycles, then i took the dough out and put it in a loaf pan, and popped it into the oven at 350F for 15 minutes. It rose beautifully and a had a wonderful crust. I have made a loaf of this bread everyday since trying the recipe!

Tried this recipe again but this time stopped at the dough stage and punched the living daylights out of it and reformed into rolls and wow they made tasty rolls. Oh and I substituted some of the white bread flour for wholewheat just to give it some fibre.

The texture of this bread was fantastic. The crust was flaky too. It was not dense but fluffy. The flavor was good too. Thank you for a nice change.  I used grapeseed oil instead of canola. Thanks to the reviewers who gave the tip about the water amount.

I usually do the regular Amish bread by hand. Got a new bread machine and gave it a try. My loaf was toasted golden brown and the texture was divine ! The loaf was completely eaten by my husband and kids within a half hour ! Thank you for this recipe. I am no longer buying store bought bread. Will try adding a cup of mixed seeds and oats next. Simply superb !

I make at least 3 loaves per week. This is by far the best bread I have ever made in my machine! Every loaf turns out perfect and is never around long. I did decrease the sugar a bit as the original recipe comes out too sweet, but that is the only change I will make....I make this for my friends college kids and they love it!

I make this bread the most. It's a great white bread. Good for sandwiches or just with butter. I have made the old fashioned way and it comes out sweeter and more pastry like. In the bread machine it comes out with a beautiful flaky crust

THE BEST BREAD RECIPE EVER! I make it in the bread machine or just do the dough cycle and make rolls in the oven. Everyone loves this recipe, even the health nuts in the fam who only eat wheat.

YUMMY~!  Almost ate half the loaf in one sitting with my brother!  This will be THE bread I make for our family now.  Made a few changes: used melted butter instead of oil & honey instead of sugar.  Will use half wheat flour next time.  THX shooseyq~!!

This is a great basic bread recipe.  It is very dense and also is much sweeter than most white bread recipes.  It is amazing served with soup or stew and even better made into garlic bread.  I didn't use a bread machine and it turned out fine.  I will make this one again and again, thanks for the excellent recipe.  I look forward to making this into sweet rolls as others did!

OMG IT WAS SOO GOOD!! I ate the whole loaf.... ALONE :0) I didn't have canola oil so I used Olive Oil. One of the reviewer said it's good for grilled cheese I don't know if that was why, but my Loaf was yelling at me to make grill cheese sandwiches and I really should NOT have Dairy But I Made them ate them all up... I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Thank you

This is a great recipe for a good white bread.  I don't bother with the extra kneading/rising cycle and it turns out just fine with the plain white bread cycle on my machine.

Started using this recipe non-stop. I began substituting pancake syrup for the sugar, and the results were even better.  When i ran out of syrup, I substituted real maple syrup. For some reason, I no longer need to allow for the 2nd rise, and the bread turns out excellent.  Many thanks for the recipe..I'm finally getting some (a lot) of use out of my breadmaker.

This bread was amazing! very sweet and didn't need butter or anything. Only problem i had with it was not all the flour would go into the dough. I ended up leaving it out, maybe used 5 cups instead of six. Seemed to work for me, but i recommend this to anyone!

This is my go to bread recipe now. I do however take mine out of the bread maker and bake it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes because it turns out better that way. But this is a great bread that is a touch sweet but not too sweet.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I make this at LEAST once a week, sometimes every day! My husband is in the Marine Corps, and when he takes his lunch with him to work, and he pulls out this fresh home made bread, all the guys in his shop are jealous!  My bread machine isn't big enough to actually COOK this in, so I put it in as a dough, let it run through one cycle of dough, roll it out on a floured surface, put it in a loaf pan, let it rise again, THEN bake it at 350 for about 20 minutes.

This is the only bread that consistently comes out of my Zojirushi bread machine perfectly - everything else may or may not rise, may or may not be a doorstop.  I originally scaled this to 16 servings as my bread machine makes a 2-pound loaf and the recipe makes a 1.5 pound loaf, but that ends up rising out of the top of my bread machine.

made this with my kitchenaid - combined sugar & warm water, then sprinkled yeast over and let that get bubbly for about 5 minutes. then mixed in rest of the ingredients until a dough formed. switched to dough hook and let the machine knead 5-7 minutes. baked at 350 about 27 minutes. very good and i like the low # of ingredients! i also dont have bread flour left so i use 1 TB vital wheat gluten for every cup of flour. have also used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 AP flour, added ground flax seeds, etc. maybe not as authentic-tasting (i'm no expert!), but still delicious and more nutritious!

Excellent, soft, but lightly crispy edges - mmmmm. My first experience with a bread machine and I'm hooked!*The order of ingredients: salt, oil, warm water on bottom layer then sugar and flour in next layer and finally yeast in a small well (not breaking through to liquids though!).   I subbed regular vegetable oil for the canola and it worked great.  Quite sweet but I love it that way.  I used King Arthur bread flour and it was PERFECT! Followed other advice and measure the water as 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp which looked to be about 1 and an 1/8th cup. I did stop and restart my bread maker in the beginning of the second rise so all in all it actually had 3 rises (two 23 minute rising and one hour long rise!)   It came right up almost to the top of the hopper and ended up weighing almost 2.5 pounds even with following all measurements!  So delicious tender and sweet- I can't wait to bake loaves for all of my family!  Try it - you'll probably LOVE IT! *  
Pictures and more details here:http://twebby.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/amish-bread/
*Hubby and I ate 2 slices before leaving it on the kitchen counter while going for a winter hike.  The dog was in the living room blocked from the kitchen by a baby gate.  15 year old dog busted through the gate and retrieved it from the 3.5 ft counter.  Ate through the ziploc and devoured 2 pounds of bread!  Best meal that dogs probably ever had!

I have a Zojirushi BBCCX20. I'm not very familiar with it yet so I didn't stop the cycle. I used the BASIC setting and LIGHT for the crust. I did not think this was going to work because I peaked through the machine's window several times and noticed that the dough looked very sticky. I let it go all the way and was pleasently surprised by the results. The crust was a tad crispy on the sides but not on the top, the inside of the bread is soft and delicious. I cut one slice to check on the bread and see if I could serve it with dinner and found myself slicing more and more... you know... to double and triple check it was safe to serve to others :o)  I'll be making this one often.

I love this recipe!  It has become my regular white bread recipe and also serves as the base for unlimited variations since I have the basic recipe memorized.  Delicious!  One particular variation that I've played around with is to add a tsp of vanilla and two tablespoons of molasses.  I had to add a little more flour to compensate for the additional liquid (or maybe eliminate the two extra tablespoons of water instead).  At the beep in the machine's cycle, I add a couple of handfuls of raisins or craisins and another big handful of walnuts.  YUM!  However, the original recipe is beautiful on its own.

I don't buy bread at all.  I make all my bread in the machine.  This is by far the best bread I've tried, and I've made many, many loaves.  At the end of the mixing cycle, I had batter instead of dough, so I added 1/4 cup of flour.  When I make it again, and I will, I will use 3 cups of flour.  I think that, if you use a very soft flour such as White Lily, it might be a good idea to use 3 cups of flour.  Thanks very much for a wonderful recipe!

VERY nice.  Very few ingredients with good results.  Slightly sweet but not too sweet.  Added some fresh rosemary to the second loaf and it was beautiful.  This has become my standard white bread recipe.

I made this while visiting my mom for Thanksgiving- EVERYONE LOVED IT! It was so EASY... I let my dough rise 3 times, plus it was cold in my mom's house so it felt like it too forever to rise but in the end it came out JUST RIGHT! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I let my bread bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Even thought I put butter in it before baking, I put butter in it after it came out too (gotta love it) my crust was just right! And remember: 18 Tbsp of water= 1 cup & 2 Tbsp. Good Luck baking!

Well, I can understand now why this recipe rates 5 stars! OUTSTANDING!!!!! It smells wonderful, it raises quicker and higher than my other recipes and weighs half as much when done. One batch made two loaves which was great but I did find you have to be very careful when handling as it will 'deflate' if you mess with the dough just before baking. I'm going to make clover-leaf dinner rolls next time. Thank you, thank you!  PS: When I put the dough in its pan (any recipe), I brush it with an egg/butter mixture, cover it with a damp cloth and put it on a heating pad, set on Low. Raises like a charm.

PERFECT!  This will be my bread recipe from now on.  I changed the servings to 18 and ended up with 2 perfect loaves.   I also made these the old fashion way since I don't have a machine.  Wonderful!!

Tastes great but four times later I still can't get it to rise as pictured. I followed the directions to the letter... it tastes really good but it just won't rise. I thought it was my fault at first being new to bread machines but every other recipe I've used has risen perfectly. Really sorry to give it such a bad review...

I bake this at least once a week. It is a great bread to use. I do put in flax seed and some honey to make it a little sweeted if I want a sweeter bread. But I love this recipe. In fact you know its good when your parents ask for the recipe. LOL.

I have tried many recipes over the past years - but this one is simply the best!!  My daughter has always been very fussy about which brand of bread to buy but she simply loves this one.  It is lovely slightly toasted with lots of grated cheese. My standard method for making fresh bread for the following morning is as follows:  Prepare mixture according to recipe above, set machine on dough setting and start.  When finished, reset machine for delay start according to your machine's instructions.  I prefer to use light crust setting. (My husband absolutely loves the smell of this bread when he gets ready @ six in the morning to go to work.)

I have made several good breads from this site. My husband survives on bread, and this is his favorite. I just used the regular 2 lb setting on my machine ( I use the timer and make it overnight so it's ready in the morning) and it came out perfectly. The setting is for 4 hours, and I'm not sure if all machines take that long. I was so confused about the measurements at first I went on Wikipedia, 18 T = 1 Cup + 2 T, as several people mentioned.  I appreciate how simple the ingredients are! Nothing special is needed, and the bread is great!

This is amazing bread.  I have been using this recipe and recommending it for about two years now.  It comes out great as listed here, but is also very adaptable.  I cut back the sugar, and make it with white whole wheat or a mixture with spelt flout too. My family likes it so much I always double the recipe. Also, I make it using my kitchenAid mixer and doing the second rise in the pans, baking them in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 minutes.

I have made 4 loaves of bread in my new bread machine using Cusinarts recipes and all have felt like they were lead weights used to sink a body or something! Good for toast but not for sandwiches. This Amish Bread recipe is outstanding, stupendous, easy, quick to gather ingredients and most of all my first time it came out perfect and made me so happy to have asked for this bread machine for Christmas! I have boycotted commercial breads since they use chemicals that I do not wish to ingest anymore! Besides all that, this bread tasted sooooo goood and the texture of it was perfect and OMG it made delicious sandwiches! It was good just plain, nothing on it! Just bread and water, I could live with that now!  Now I must try all my favorite sandwiches like PB & J that is when it is safe to have Peanut Butter again! I love this bread!

My whole family loves this bread, It goes great with spinach dip and makes the best french toast--if it lasts until morning!! When I lived in Colorado I had to make a high-altitude adjustment though and either buy high-altitude flour or add two tablespoons flour. I also only ran one cycle.

This was a wonderful bread.  It worked well as written- which is rare up here in the arid north.  I made a double batch- half was used for a wonderful pizza the other half cooked in a bread pan.  My family loved it so much, both the pizza and loaf were gone in 3 days.

Fantastic! Made it per recipe the first time. Second time I made a few adjustments, not that it needed it. I cut out the bread flour. Substituted 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup corn meal. Put in 1 package active dry yeast, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup warm water. Then added enough white flour to make a non-stick dough. Maybe 2 cups. Baked at 350 deg. for 30 min. Everyone thought it was great. The loag lasted about 10 min..I am baking more today! Thank you so much!

Fantastic recipe!!! I know this sounds weird but I put almost pure hot water in first then the sugar, salt, oil and then I take my flour out of the freezer and put 3 cups in. Then the yeast. (1 1/2 tsp) I do that because I don't have the time to check the temp of water do to working 3 jobs. The dough is a little sticky but my bread machine does just fine with this recipe. I set it for a light crust and let it go. When the machine is done, I cut the top off for a fresh slice then put it on the cut end to let the bottom dry out a little, bag it and slice it for sandwiches.

I have tried many bread recipes and I like this one best. I have made Garlic Bread by adding garlic infused oil instead of canola oil. Great for toasted meatball, chicken salad or anything else that goes good with garlic bread. 

By the way, I am a man that loves good bread. I also love this website.

GREAT RECIPE!   My family (including my 2 year old) had it gone in no time and was requesting another loaf.  We will definitely be using this recipe a lot.   I also made this by first using the basic dough setting on my bread machine.  As soon as that cycle was complete, I ran the basic white bread (with light crust) setting.   Figure almost 5 hours from start to finish running it this way, but it is so worth it.  QUICK NOTE:  I measured out the 18 TBS of water, and that equals out to be 1 cup plus 2 TBS.

This was WONDERFUL!!
I just recieved a bread machine for Mother's Day and I tried three other white bread recipes and this is BY FAR THE BEST one!!

I had to completely unplug my machine & re-set it so it could do the extra rise. I'm glad I did it! The bread came out so light & fluffy, it was perfect for sandwiches & toasts. My whole family loves it.
I followed the recipe & instructions exactly as described & it came out perfect.

it's a very good white bread: I used it for ham sandwiches and it was much appreciated by my 4-year-old going for end-of-term day trip with playschool. A bit on the sweet side, but I cut back a little on sugar from the start, readind other cooks'comments.

A fantastically easy soft loaf. Not wanting a sweet bread, I cut the sugar in half as per the comments and it works fabulously as a meal accompaniment as well as toast for breakfast. 

adjustment note: all-purpose flour works just fine.

EXcellent!!!!I always wanted to make bread from scratch. Without knowing the first thing about bread baking...I tried this recipe.  I learned a lot and was extremely impressed with the results.  The family loved it, even my father-in-law who grew up in the bread baking business. It had his approval.  My kids think I am a genius.

This is a great bread!  Very easy to make and very tasty.  I've made 6 or 7 loaves exactly following the recipe and not one loaf has had time to cool before it was completely eaten by my family.  It is a hair bit sweet, but definitely not too sweet for our tastes.  This will soon be our everyday bread.

The flavor of this bread is fantastic! Unfotunately, whatever I do (and I've made this bread several times) I cannot get it to rise properly...I think it's my bread machine. Next time I'll try it in the oven.

Very easy bread, however I wasn't that impressed. I guess it was a little sweeter than I had hoped; maybe it needs more salt. I would alter it a little more and make it again.

Excellent, easy to make and easier to eat. The crust (when warm) has a lovely sweet taste. It tastes fine when cooled but loses the sweetness. I have a loaf in the bread maker as I type this. I am going to check and see if Sherry Ann has posted a multigrain recipe for the bread maker that is this quick to make. Thanks for the recipe.

I was a bit anxious breaking away from my breadmaker's recipe book, but am so glad that I did!  This bread couldn't be simpler to make, and it turned out wonderfully!  A versatile, tasty white bread.

This recipe took half the yeast that I would normaly use for my white bread. It has a wonderfully flaky crust, and a good flavor too.

This is really good basic white bread.  The only problem I seemed to have was that it was still a bit "doughy" on the inside so I stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes and that seemed a little better, but perhaps next time I will leave it in for even longer.  BUT--It's still the best white bread I have made.

This is delicious!  Blew the top off my small, older Regal BM...next time I'll reduce flour and water.  Also subbed butter for oil, as I was out.   Great for sandwiches!  thanks for the great recipe.

This bread is so simple and very good. I have made it 4 times in my bread machine and it comes out perfect every time. I did as the recipe stated. I have made other breads that were more complicated but not as good as this one. It is just a great white bread~yummy.

This was the first recipe I've used with my breadmaker -- and it turned out great! I didn't follow the directions in regards to restarting the machine for a second full rising cycle since mine goes through three rise cycles on the setting I used, and it was still super fluffy. I'm going to add a little more sugar next time since my partner likes his bread really sweet, but I wouldn't change a thing otherwise.

Some of the best basic white bread I've had.

I had just about given up on my bread machine but this recipe saved it from the pit of bread machine hell! Fantastic taste & texture.  I followed this recipe to a T & it came out great!  I also made french toast with it the next day & I think it's the best I've ever made! Try the original recipe first & then make any changes to your taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I recently purchased a Zojirushi BB-HAC10 Mini Bread Machine and was having problems finding a soft sandwich bread that my husband liked.  I tried this one and loved it.  I did change the quantity of bread flour to 3 cups after reading a lot of the reviews.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar and noticed no difference at all, though I may lower the amount some.  Next is to experiment using some whole wheat flour.  Hopefully it will turn out as well as the regular recipe.  As a side note, I just let my machine run through the regular mode using the firm crust and it did great.  My machine has 3 rises, so I wanted to try a loaf without restarting as the recipe called for.  It worked perfectly.

This tastes wonderful.  I don't own a bread maker, so I just spent the relaxing time kneading the bread to be very smooth and light - it turned out so beautiful.  Excellent, simple, and easy recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

First time I've ever made bread from scratch.  Turned out perfectly, and my family loved it.  I will make it more often, and add it to our holiday menus.  We just love it.

I tried this one over the weekend, and didn't end up with the same results that most others seem to.  I followed the directions to stop and start after the first full rise.  My breadmachine (a Sunbeam) has a Sandwich cycle, which I used.  The bread smelled absolutely wonderful as it baked, and rose well, I believe.  However, I wouldn't classify it as dense at all.  I made my son a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with it, and almost ripped the bread while spreading.  It did make excellent toast, so 5 stars for that, but only 3 stars as a sandwich bread.  My machine came with a sandwich bread recipe, so I will stick with that one.  But I would make this one again for a sweet breakfast toast.

I should give it 5 stars as everyone else has, but it didn't rise too well and then it didn't bake too well and overall it was a dud.  But I really think it is something I am doing wrong.  I could make bread until 2 weeks ago and now nothing will turn out right and not sure what it is.  I will give this one another shot, but not today.

AWESOME! I used vegetable oil instead of canola and it turned out fine. The bread turned out so fluffy and moist-- I don't think I'll ever buy sandwich bread from the store ever again!

It took me two tries to get this bread right.  The first time I did not stop my bread machine to get that extra full rise.  My machine has a full rise, short rise, & final rise.  I thought that would be enough.  It was not!  My bread came out very doughy.  So the second time I followed the recipe and added the extra full rise and it came out perfect!  Great white bread.  One of the previous reveiwers said it best, "This is what store bought bread strives to be."

This is my favorite basic white bread. I use melted butter in place of the oil and milk for the water. This gives a beautiful soft crumb and tastes delicious!

I make this on the dough setting in my bread maker, I need to bump the flour up to 3 cups and it is still sticky dough! So when it comes time to punching down and re-shaping for the pan I just make sure to flour my surfaces liberally! You get one large loaf of bread with this if you make it 18 servings you can get two smaller loafs that are perfect in our house. I have made this recipe several times trying butter, oil and coconut oil we prefer coconut oil in this house but each one worked well with the recipe :)

I made this bread the other day after trying several different white bread recipes.  None of the recipes I had tried before were all that impressive, this one was! Me & my husband loved this bread and will continue to make this recipe! Now I can say that I won't be buying bread from the store anymore!

Good bread, although I would cut down on the sugar. A bit too sweet for me. I think I will try this recipe to make cinnamon buns.

Not sure why people like this bread the way it is-to soft of a texture and no real flavor.  I make it and add cheese curds and red pepper flakes on last rise.  I do not put it in a loaf pan but make a round on a cookie sheet or a baking stone.  Now it's a five star recipe.  We call it spicy cheesy bread.

Hmm.  Not sure why this has the high rating it does.  I followed to a T.  OK texture, a bit too soft as it was hard to butter even while warm.  Not crazy about the taste either.  Guess I will just keep looking.

I didn't read the instructions properly so I didn't restart the bread machine, but the bread still came out really great although the loaf size was smallish. I also used vegetable oil as I had no canola oil but I think this was the nicest bread machine bread I have made so far. I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely fantastic bread.  I'm not much of a bread person, but I could eat a whole loaf myself.  This bread is now my go to recipe and my husband and daughter get so excited every time they see the bread machine out!  It's so soft in the inside and has a crisp, flaky crust on the outside.  It is a sweet bread, but not too sweet.  I make mine to go with homemade soups.  It's my favorite bread ever!  My family of 3 can eat it in one sitting and fight over the last piece!

I LOVE this bread!  I was skeptical of the 5 star rating, and had to see for myself. I made this to go with beef stew. My FIL was visiting and couldn't get enough of it. We finished off the loaf that night. He went home with the recipe. :)  I have made this several times in the last week and it's addicting. This bread makes a yummy, light bread, suitable for sandwiches. I had to watch my machine though, because it was done 10 min. before my bread machine was, even on a light crust setting. Perfect bread. Thank you!

I've made this for years now from this site. Whenever I use 3/4 cup water plus 2 tbsp it turns out perfect, when I use 1 cup plus 2 tbsp it's just okay.. don't know why that is but I'll stick with my 3/4 c. water plus 2 tbsp. We like this bread!

I have made this recipe regularly since I first tried it (more than a year ago).  This is our regular sandwich bread and also a very popular party bread.  I have tried with 1/2 cup wheat flour and use brown sugar, add different herbs (cinnamon and ginger, oregano and thyme, rosemary etc).  They are all very popular, both to us and to our guests.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have a son who is allergic to soy, so making my own bread is my only option.  I LOVE this bread! I have the recipe memorized I make it so often! The only change I have made is using 3 c bread flour instead of the 2 3/4....but either way its GREAT!

This recipe was my very first bread machine recipe!  I now make it several times a week.  We have replaced buying bread at the grocery store with this recipe.  It's sweet which is nice, but maybe not for everyone.

This bread was beautiful, big and fluffy, kept well.  It was a bit too sweet for our family though.  I'm going to keep looking for another recipe.

very easy, sweet and soft bread. instead of re-setting the breadmaker for a 2nd cycle, after the 2nd kneading, i took the loaf out kneaded the bread very breafly and placed in a bread pan, let rise and baked in the oven

This is my most used bread machine recipe.  It calls for simple ingredients that are always on hand, but turns out better than ones you need a whole list of supplies for.  Me and my family really love this bread, thanks so much for sharing it!

I didn't have any luck with this recipe, even after trying it twice. Compared to other recipes I've used, as well as the recommendations in the recipes that came with my bread maker, the measurements on this recipe are way off.  Try BEST BREAD MACHINE BREAD by DiggetyDog.

Wonderful recipe. Delicious bread. Extremely hard to stop eating it fresh out of the oven. More fragrant, moist and longer lasting if you shape it yourself and cook it in the oven. 5 huge stars!

I thought the bread is too dense for me. Maybe because of oil made it heavy. Or maybe too much oil. It was chewy and sliced great. Since I don't have machine so I made it manually. But I may not make it again. Sorry.

I made this recipe as directed. Two dough cycles and one full cycle and though the texture was fine the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. I will probably never make this again. Not sure why it gets so great of reviews.

I made this last weekend. It is a very sweet and delicious dough. The only thing is that it didnt cook thouroughly in my breadmachine. So, after it cooled, the next morning i fried it for breakfast. That might sound absolutley gross, but it was very good actually. If your bread didn't cook all the way, i sugest you try frying it and see if you like it!!

This bread turned out really well, good flavor  and consistancy a bit much sugar for my taste.  Really good for sweet toast in the morning or peanut butter sandwiches.  Not the best bread for deli sandwiches.

This bread was truely delicious! Slightly sweet, and just like Grandma used to make. I didn't change a thing. (Note...they make a little 4-TBSP measuring cup now that makes the 18 TBSP easier.)

This was my first attempt using a machine.  It was a good, light texture, but lacked much "bready" flavor.  Might be my yeast.  Will try again!

A great recipe for your first loaf (and many more after that)! It's surprisingly versatile - I accidentally used 1/4 tsp. of yeast the first time instead of 1 tsp. Bread came out dense and a little weird-tasting, but still good. I've also tried it with just 2 risings (my bread machine's normal cycle) instead of 3. Crumb wasn't as fine, but the joy of still-warm bread first thing in the morning was well worth it. Also try it with half canola / half extra virgin olive oil. Especially delicious.

This was a good bread. Probably not my absolute favorite in taste, but my family did enjoy it. Huge bonus points for simplicity of ingredients! I didn't even have to wonder if I had enough. Another bonus for being one solitary loaf. It makes it easier to eat it all before it goes dry that way!

Best white bread recipe!  I am new to cooking bread and my bread machine.  I tried 5 different recipes - this one being the last.  This is a soft sweet white bread, actually melts in your mouth.  I could have ate the whole loaf myself if I wasn't so carb conscience.  Out of all the recipes I tried this one was by far the best.  I made in it my bread machine and it came out great. I only had breadmachine (rapidrise) yeast on hand, but came out great anyway. This will be my white bread recipe for life.

Seriously--I am a bread LOVER and this bread is AWESOME!!! I personally do not like conola oil, so I can tell you that this tastes great using either vegetable oil (soy) or olive oil (I used it when I ran out of vegetable oil) The taste reminds me of challah. Try this--you won't be sorry!

LOVE!! Makes a wonderfully white bread with a slight sweetness to it. Made in my bread machine and my family literally ate the whole loaf in 5 minutes!!  I was planning on using throughout the week but I guess I have to make more now.  Best white bread recipe I have tried yet...and I've tried lots.

Excellent!  My husband was so impressed, I'd never made bread before and he generally views me as being able to cook, but NOT bake :)  My whole family ate this bread as the main course instead of the side!  Even the 4 year old.

My daughter loved this bread.  I used the light crust setting.  I agree with the other reviewers, just change the ingredients to ready 1 cup plus 2 T of water.  Really nice with a bit of butter and some honey!

This was ok. Would have given 3 stars but I couldnt stop the cycle so it wasnt followed exactly. The bread was fluffy but the flavor wasnt great. Also, the loaf was 1/2 the size it should be. Might of been my fault or just the recipe. With only 1 teaspoon of yeast, it was probably the recipe.

This is our basic bread that we make in our bread machine... The sugar is a little much though and makes it way too sweet, so we halved it.

Very good - was a hit at our new years day party especially with people who like soft white bread.  It is not quite as sweet as Hawaiian bread, but it is sweet so probably not something I would make every day.  I made it in the Breadman Pro.

Last night I pulled out my bread maker for the first time in YEARS!  I made a loaf of bread from a mix, and it turned out ok.  Today I thought I woould try to make bread from scratch.  I used this recipe and even though I made a mistake (and fixed halfway through mixing) it turned out wonderful. My six year old has been going crazy over this bread, and my husband said that it was much better than the loaf made from the mix.  This will certainly be my new go-to white bread recipe.  Thanks!

This was like the bread you get for sandwiches.  I was looking for something a bit heavier and chewier.  So it was good for what it was and easy to make.

Maybe it's me, but the dough was WAY TOO WET.  It looked like pancake batter.  I tried this recipe twice with the same results.  Each time I had to add up to 3/4 Cups of flour.  The resulting bread was dense, but tasty and sweet. IF I try this again, I will either cut back on the water or start with 3 Cups of flour and watch the first mixing cycle like a hawk.

also i've done this on the dough cycle in the bread maker yesterday, when it was finished I used a bit of flour kneaded it, place in a greased loaf pan, and let it rise in a warm oven for about 40 mins, then baked it, 45 mins at 350 degrees, turned out great!!

Made it, loved it.  Make sure not to double the recipe unless you want to make a mess.  We have a machine that makes loaves up to 3 lbs well for the amish bread the 1.5 is big enough.  The whole family loved it

This bread is simple and delicious.  I use my Kitchen aid stand mixer to mix and knead.  My family loves fresh homemade bread with real butter.  Comfort food!!

This was too sweet for our tastes.  It would better be served as a dipping bread than a sandwich bread, since it reminds me of Hawaiian Sweet Bread.

Fantastic, soft on the inside, crisp tender crust, white bread.  I subbed applesauce for the oil and it came out of the breadmaker delicious, fragrant and amazing.  This will be our go to recipe for white bread.  Superb served with strawberry rhubarb jam.

New favorite!  The consistency was awesome.  We did add a bit more breadmaker yeast because of our high humidity and it was rainy.  I will probably make this at least a few times a month.  Thanks SHOOSEYQ for posting it.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I have begun receiving requests for it!  The texture is perfect; it toasts up lovely, and makes great toads in the hole for breakfast.  My bread machine requires some babying in the beginning of the cycle to make sure all of the flour is incorporated, but once you see the texture come together (it will look slightly moist and sticky), it takes care of itself.  Fantastic!  Thank you!

I made two loaves of this bread last winter by hand (no bread machine here).  My family went nuts over this bread. The kids sliced it thick and toasted it.  The most important thing was to proof the yeast, after that, it was a piece of cake! Looking forward to making this again this winter.  Five Stars.

Absolutely a great white bread recipe! The doubling, of course take different times depending on many factors, but if you do wait for complete doubling, you'll be rewarded with a very light and tasty pair of good-enough-for-company loaves.

This is the ONLY white bread I allow in my house! I make this bread 3 or 4 times a week. With prices as they are, you can't beat how economical this recipe is. It goes without saying how much healthier it is than bread purchased at the store. My only change is that I bake it in the oven at 350 for about 35-40 minutes....tastes just like Grandma's!

This bread is delicious.  My kiddos love this bread with a bit of honey butter at dinner time.  I used the light setting on my breadmaker and took the bread out as soon as it was finished and it came out perfect.

Fantastic! My husband loved it for toast, though I think it is best fresh and warm. It had a wonderfully flaky crust and soft crumb. The second time I made it, I forgot to restart the machine and it still turned out great! A definite keeper!

Ive been using this recipe for a couple of months now, and I must say it makes THE BEST bread. My bread machine pooped out so I make this by hand and when my 17 year old comes home from school and sees it she makes a v-line right to it and scarfs down about a 1/4 of the loaf. Its a big hit at my house.

I followed the directions exactlly and the bread came out wonderfull.  My kids were picking holes in it before I got a chance to slice it.  It was a little sweet, but nothing I didn't expect and was definitly not too sweet.  This will be replaceing my everyday white bread im used to makeing.

This is by fr the best bread I have ever made and I have made a lot of bread in my machine. I change the measurments to make 2 loaves, 1/1/2 C. warm water 1/4 C. sugar 2 teas. yeast, let that proof in bread pan for 5 min. then add 1/4 C. oil,  3 C. bread flour, 1 C. wheat flour, LAST 1 teas. salt.  (DO NOT PUT THE SALT IN WITH THE YEAST!!) I run it thru the dough cycle including leting it rise in my bread machine, then take it out knead it a couple of min. then form into 2 loafs and place in greased bread pans and let rise until about double then bake in oven for about 25to 30 min. at 350. Check loaves because everyones oven cooks different you made need less or more time. THANK YOU for this recipe

If you think this is just another 'white bread recipe', you would be wrong!  This delicious bread is high-rising, light and sweet to the taste.  I was so surprised at the simplicity of it - I made exactly according to directions and it came out great!  I will continue to make to years to come.

My previous review has vanished somewhere,so I am leaving another one.  I use 3 cups of all purpose flour and 3 tsp. of active dry yeast.  I let the yeast dissolve in the warm water (1 cup plus 2 TBSP) and then add everything to the pan, adding the flour last.  I prefer to use the dough cycle and then bake the bread in my oven for a better crust. I let the dough rise in my bread pan about 45 minutes  or so after removing from the bread machine pan and then bake at 350 for about 25 minutes.   Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this many times now, and haven't had a bad loaf yet.  This is really good bread and quite versatile - it tastes great for sandwiches, toast, or just plain.

My kids and husband can't get enough of this bread.   They won't eat bread from the store now & i am making 2 loaves every other day.  It is no big deal as this bread is easy to make and letting my bread machine mix it up there really is no mess.  NOTE:  I dissolve the sugar in warm water then add it to my machine turns out perfect every time!

My family loves this bread! My bread machine makes a 2lb loaf, so I changed the servings to 16 and it was just perfect!  I just set the machine to basic with a medium crust and let it go.  My husband says that this is his favorite bread recipe so far. Thanks for sharing it!

Great recipe for a novice. I used the 1/4 cup sugar variant & the bread was great. On my 2nd attempt I modified it into Oatmeal bread by substituting 2 cups of Old Fashioned Oatmeal for 2 of the 6 cups of flour. I split the water 1 cup to proof the yeast and 1 cup to moisten the oat meal. After the yeast had proofed I added the moist oatmeal and then the rest of the flour and proceded as the recipe called for. The result was an outstanding 2 loaves of oatmeal bread, a bit more coarse than the original recipe and a bit softer.

As an absolute novice at this baking bread stuff I'm psyched...

I made this a week ago, and tonight I made it for the fifth time. This is the first bread I ever made and now I am afraid to try another recipe, it is just that good. My husband just toasted it with butter and orange marmalade..yummy.

Easy to make, delicious and soft.  I did not do the third rise method in my bread machine and it still worked beautifully.  Will be a staple at our house.

Recipe needs to be cut down a bit for a 1 1/2 lb bread machine.
Bread was good. As far as comments about it being too sweet. It is a sweeter bread, but I think that is how it is intended to be. It is not sweet in a bad way by any means.  I will make it again, exactly as the recipe states.

Maybe it's just my bread maker - but the second dough session was too much.  I think it was because it beat the dough for too long (as if it was mixing the ingredients for the first time).

I've made it again - and only used the dough setting.  Then I removed it from the bread maker punched it down, then let it raise again on my warm oven. Then baked in the oven.

It's a good recipe - but not really a functional bread maker recipe.  It's one of those that if you have the time to make it by hand - then that's the way to do it. Otherwise skip it.

Just right. Followed directions as is using bread flour, only I did not use the extra rising cycle suggestion. Still came out lovely, lightly sweet. Used light crust setting and i think it would have been too dark on any other. My son liked to eat it plain, my daughter with buttr and I liked it with toasted cheese. Delish1

What a great loaf of bread!  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did as previous reviewers suggested, and ran the dough cycle and then the bake cycle.  I'm going to try it again without doing the dough cycle first just to see how it turns out.  I like to rub the crust with butter when it comes out, just to soften the crust.  I think it makes it a little easier to slice.  I love this recipe and I'm sure it will be made often in my home.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This bread was perfect. Not at all too sweet.  I used a reviewer's suggestion and put it through the dough cycle and then once more through the bread cycle. It was perfect! My first time using the bread machine!

Very good bread!  TIP:  If your machine has a dough cycle, do the bread on that first, then do the full bread cycle--that way the machine will turn itself off after it rises the first time, and you can select the full bread cycle the second go-round! ;)
UPDATE:  I actually found the bread to be much better texture-wise by just letting it go through the whole cycle the first time.  It definately doesn't need the second rising in my opinion.

Thank you.  Great recipe, it's a keeper.  I made it by hand, doubled the batch, followed the recipe exactly -   doubled everything, but reduced the water by 1/4 cup.  Next time I double, I'm going to reduce the water by 3/4  cup, because reducing by 1/4 wasn't enough.

Excellent bread.  Was great for toast or for making french toast.  Would be too sweet to make a sandwich with, at least for my taste

This is a fabulous recipe. Have made many recipes and not very good at making bread and this bread is best tasting and best rising.  I made it as rolls instead of a loaf.  If this is  your first time making bread this would be the way to go.  I read alot of the comments on being to much sugar..I never really noticed any surgar in the bread and I put in the reccomended amount. My family loved it and praised how great my bread was.  I felt awsome!

This was a perfect white bread for the bread machine.  I did not bake it in my machine.  Instead I allowed the machine to run as usual.  Then I removed the dough, punched it down and let it rise in a regular bread pan.  Baked it at 350 for about an hour.  It was great.  My DH who doesn't care for homemade bread because the crusts are always to hard, loved it.  I think I will make this regularly. My boys ate their whole lunchmeat sandwich (never happens at our house) when I made it on this bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I tried this recipe, it didn't rise like I expected it to.  After a bit of research, I added 1 Tbsp of gluten and it turned out perfect!  Defintely a great sandwich bread.

I love this receipe! I use it for sandwich bread, rolls, hambuger buns and hotdog buns. My oven even went out on me and they even cook well on the grill if you watch them and rotate them for even browing. Thank you so much for this receipe.

This was the first time I've tried the 'double the phase 1 rising' trick and the results were fantastic. This recipe takes about an hour longer than most white bread ones do but the result is quite worth the investment.

This bread is absolutely delicious! I made the dough in breadmaker, then rolled out dough to make little buns stuffed with bacon and onion and baked in oven, my kids love it! The bacon buns dont last too long though - my kids just gobble them up :):)

Best recipe for white bread. I followed the directions exactly. My machine cooks dark so I removed it 10 minutes early. It also has an extra mead cycle. Best tasting and looking white bread I've found.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now. I half the sugar, I find it too sweet. I started using kangen ionized water with a PH of 6.0. It really makes the yeast work better. This recipe also makes amazing cinnamon buns. I have tried a few other bread recipes, this one is the best

Recipes that include flour should be measured in ounces, or better yet, in grams.  So, for this recipe, 2-3/4 cups of flour would convert to 330 grams, or 11.7 ounces.  This is a far more accurate way to measure.  I wish that Allrecipes had the option to adjust recipes into grams or ounces like King Arthur recipes do--really not a difficult process.

I've made this bread twice now and it is so good. It is especially good for making sandwiches, toast or eating right out of the bread machine. I will probably make another loaf tomorrow and try using it in the panini maker. I have visions of provolone, pastrami, olive tapenade. Yum!

FANTASTIC!! I made this with Red Mill whole wheat bread flour to make it more healthier and I didn't make it in a bread machine, but kneeded it in my Ninja blender with the dough hook for less then 5 minutes. I followed the directions from another reviewer that also didnt make this bread from a bread machine. Very simple bread that one can use with ease. I plan on making this often, when the mood strikes me for making fresh baked bread. :)

I sub brown sugar and melted butter for the white sugar and oil.  Amazing!  I usually donât go in for fancy food descriptions, but those substitutions  definitely add a âdepth of flavorâ.  I also turn off my bread machine when the timer is down to about 30 minutes and let it bake in the residual heat.  Slightly crusty on the outside and delectably chewy on the inside.  The loaf never lasts the night at my house!

Really happy with this bread. Made the recipe as written only I took it out after the dough cycle, let it rise a second time in a greased loaf pan for 50 minutes and then baked it at 350 for about 28 minutes. My family LOVED it!

I make bread twice per week for my family and this is my go-to recipe.  And, to be honest, I throw the ingredients into a bread maker and walk away and return to perfection every time!  The best part about this recipe is it makes for great sandwiches and toast.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The taste is great.  I let the machine do all the work so that it baked in the canister.  Although I used the dark crust setting the crust still came out moister than I had hoped.  I wanted a high loaf so I could make sandwiches so I didn't put it in a loaf pan which tends to make the bread a little flatter and therefore the slices are smaller.  One thing I've learned about baking in the bread machine, if you let the bread rest for about five minutes and then shake the canister the bread comes out easily with no dough left behind.  It makes not only for a smoother bread (with a only a small indentation where the paddle has been) but it also means the canister is easier to clean.  Next time I'll baking the bread in a pan.
Made it again in a pan - turned out fabulous.  Washed it with egg and topped with sesame seeds.  Looks beautiful.  Increased the ratings to the top.

my son and I loved this bread!  I liked that it had no egg, since I'm a veggie.  It did have a bit of a sweet taste.   I use the sandwich cycle on my bread machine, worked perfect.

It was easy to put it together but was so super sticky in the bread machine that the machine paddle, 1/3 of the way through, didn't pick up the loose flour on the edges (dough cycle). Had to cancel the process, scrape it down carefully with my silicone scraper then restart the dough cycle again. Even after the dough cycle had finished through the second rising, it was super sticky. Made certain that there was enough flour on the silpat baking prep sheet to manage the stick dough but still had a horrible sticky mess even with quickly flouring, flipping and folding to manage to get the dough into a boule. Ended up just lightly but well greasing the inside of my vintage Lodge dutch oven and baking it covered for the first 2/3 of the baking as instructed.

I made exactly as stated, except that my bread machine has 3 rest cycles so I did not have to restart it over, thankfully. I set the machine for a light crust, and I think that was the only problem-- it left the bread a little doughey on the inside. So next time I will set my machine for a medium crust and hopefully that will take care of that! Otherwise, the bread was delicious! Despite its dougheyness, what was cooked was delicate, light and fluffy in texture, with a nice sweet flavor. Wow, I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

With absolutely no changes, this bread came out with perfect flavor and texture.  It has just the right amount of "sweet" in it.  The outer crust was not tough like many bread machine results can yield.  Hubs gobbled up half of the loaf before supper.  Needless to say it's a definite keeper.

Excellent bread! I used olive oil instead of canola and cooked it on my machine's white bread cycle, light 1.5lb loaf, and it came out perfectly. I'm about to make another right now.

I made this bread tonight, the ONLY thing I did different was use veg. oil as I was out of canola, DIDN'T matter! This is BY FAR the best bread I've made! It is exactly how I like bread to be & I am NOT a bread eater! My husband barely sat down to dinner when I shoved a piece in his mouth, he laughed as he knew it had to be good for me to do that. Though it's sweet, it's not overbearing & it took all I had not to eat more while it was still hot. I ate the "heel" after buttering it all up THATS how I knew I was in trouble. Can't wait till breakfast to toast some!

I  used the Armstrong method so it makes one loaf at a time. Everything is basically the same but I let it rise twice for 45 minutes each time then baked at 325* for 25 minutes.

So good! Crusty outside, soft and fluffy inside.  It took nearly 5 1/2 hours with my old bread maker since I had to run it on the 'dough' setting first and then on the 'rapid bake' afterwards, but it was totally worth it! I will definitely make this again.

For a soft, moist and simple fantastic!  Making it now.  Kings Flour rate the Bread Machinei s the best for bread dough mix...  Tip:  weigh ingredients (no cups!) for repeating results!  Are you in the Florida everglades or in Alaska right now?  Makes  BIG difference.

I use my bread maker so much, I have not purchased bread since 2013. I make this particular recipe very often. As it is mentioned, wrap the bread in foil after it has baked and let it cool before slicing it. The only negative thing I can say about this recipe is that it seems to mold faster than others I have tried.

I've been baking bread for years, but  couldn't find the right recipe. Well, after years of searching, this one is it! I have an older Oster that has 2 rising phases, so I didn't need to do the mixing twice.It worked like a charm. Nothing changed, and yes, I used 18 tablespoons of water, which might be the key. I'm about to order the Zo, and i bet this bread is amazing in that machine!

This turned out pretty good, but I had to add quite a bit more flour then the recipe called for. Other reviewers have mentioned this. (it was very soupy and not dough like at all).  I added at least an additional 2/3 cup flour..probably more...I just kept adding until the dough looked right to me). It it baked up nicely and had a good texture. I was a soft bread(that is what i was looking for). We did find it a bit bland so I will add more salt and more yeast next time.  The recipe as written 3 stars but it has great potential!

Worked perfectly in my bread machine!  Set it at 1lbs and light crust. I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  The bread goes stale fast, so make sure you store it appropriately.

Made it to take to a friends house for dinner. It turned out great. Everyone loved the taste and the texture was fine and firm enough for easy slicing. It did rise even with so little yeast.   Will be making it tomorrow.

This is a great simple recipe, 
what I did was mix ingredients in
the bread machine, then remove from
bread machine, and place in a
buttered bread pan, and let rise,
and bake.

Finally! After a few years of making bread here and there, I have a recipe that mimics the density of store bought bread that I can make at home. I don't have a bread machine so I made as is with the exception of subbing all of the water with whey. The dough was rather sticky so I oiled my hands and surface to knead. After the first rising, I continued to knead the dough. I allowed it to rise in my loaf pan until it reached the top edge (60-90 minutes). Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. It was perfect!

I followed the recipe as directed, but, I did not have to reset the bread machine as the bread machine that I own has two rise cycles. I was skeptical that it would rise enough to make a decent loaf of bread because it looked really wimpy after the first rise cycle.  I was totally wrong about how it would turn out; it rose and baked beautifully.  The texture is soft and dense without the little pockets of air that I get from baking bread in the machine.  The flavor is wonderful. I like that it doesn't have eggs or milk in it either. I am excited to make this again.

This is the bread recipe I have been looking for! A simple 5 ingredient bread that comes out perfect in my little bread machine. I have tried many other recipes, including the one that came with my bread machine, and always get a dry bread. This bread is moist, with a wonderful crust that melts in your mouth. The extra step of resetting your machine to start, giving it an extra rise, really makes this bread a notch above. I set my machine for 1 1/2 lbs, as the recipe states, but actually get a larger loaf. I make a loaf about every other day. Yum Yum!

Bread turned out way too sweet and not done all the way. I turned my machine on light crust and 1.5 lb. loaf. I would defiantly put less sugar in the next time I make it.

I'm comparing this to the "Best Bread Machine Bread" here on AR, which is why I can't give this Amish Bread recipe 5 stars. This bread tastes great, but has a darker-than-I-prefer crust and was extremely challenging to slice with keeping its shape and is slightly "dough-y". I have always used the other recipe with no-fail results and I'm not sure why I decided to try something different. It was a mistake. I'm not saying this is a bad recipe, but I will stick with the "Best Bread Machine Bread" recipe.

This is one of the top 3 bread recipes I have made!  (and I am constantly experimenting and trying new recipes.). This recipe made a large, pretty loaf and the flavor is perfect. I will be making this again soon.

Not really much taste to this bread.  Have made it 3 times now, family is not impressed.  Nothing special in the taste.

dough was like batter, very liquid. rose beautifully but sank once the bake cycle started. tasted ok though. will try again but will either add more flour, to make a full 3 c or cut down on water.

This turned out great and was actually the first bread I have ever made that my husband really liked.  He tends to be super picky about bread.  I did add some garlic powder and oregano just because I was looking for an Italian herb bread when I found this recipe.

I was really looking forward to trying this bread, especially since I grew up with Amish folks. My family just wasn't fond of this bread. It came out rather bland and too sweet. It might just be a preference issue. We like Italian and French breads, sour doughs and multigrains.

Bread comes out perfect each time.  I started using honey instead of sugar & whole wheat flour, still just as fluffy and perfect for sandwiches.

I had high hopes for this bread. It was Ok but not the recipe I want as my 'go-to bread' recipe. The only thing I did change is I used melted butter instead of the oil. It was not a big hit but my husband did say it would make great 'coffee soup'!! I will keep this recipe but it won't be THE bread recipe. As long as family will eat it, that's a positive sign. I love good bread but this is not the one, for me. I strongly believe in the taste is the best judge of any recipe and this just was not there.

I love this recipe!  I is the best bread I ever made in my bread machine. So simple to make with simple ingredients.   I did up the flour to 3 cups and the water is 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons.  I put in my bread machine almost every night on the delayed cycle and we have fresh bread in the morning for sandwiches for lunch!  I sent my machine for 1.5 lb loaf and med crust.

I would give this 5 stars save for my particular bread machine (Zo X20) which tends to darken/thicken crusts of breads calling for higher sugar/milk/egg content. This is a reliable sweetish white bread with a wonderful flavor/texture. Reminiscent of the old Monk break sold in the 60s for sandwich bread. This would probably be a superior recipe for use in a pullman pan. Next, I will make this on dough setting and bake in oven. Regardless, this recipe is a definite keeper.

This bread was fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and made one loaf and a batch of hamburger buns. OMG! This is a definite keeper.  You will never buy hamburger buns again.  I will try hot dog buns next.

My go to bread recipe! My son has food allergies and because soy is on the list I have to make bread for him.  I have this recipe memorized and make it at least weekly! Sometimes I use 3 cups bread flour instead of 2 3/4 but either way....perfect!

This bread is THE sandwhich bread.  It tastes a thousand times better than store-bought bread.  It's super soft.  I used vegetable oil because that was what I had, but I doubt it made any difference.

What I was able to taste was really good. Unfortunately bread is something I just can't make. I've tried and tried and tried. That's a lot of time to invest in something that just won't work for you. But, the part that cooked well was delicious. Good recipe especially since it's the first one I've made that was partially edible ;-)

I tried this recipe as well as the "best bread machine" recipe using my Black & Decker bread machine, program 4 for sandwich, 2lb.  The bread for this recipe turned out to be better, it was not as crusty and it was not dry by the next day.  With both breads, I placed them in a ziploc bag for storage.  I'm still trying to perfect the recipe to my bread machine, I think I need to reduce the time, the crust was too thick for my liking.  However, I'm going to stick with this Amish bread, because of its texture and I like how it is a tad sweeter then the other recipe and uses less yeast.

Great tasting ad simple to make.  Made it last night and used it for toast and french toast this morning.  Everyone loved it.  Can't wait to make peanut butter and jelly tomorrow!

I've tried this bread 3 times.  It has a good taste, but dispite my following the directions exactly, it always sinks in. The last time I tried baking it in the oven instead of in the breadmaker and found the same consistency problem.

AWESOME bread!!! I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfect! The texture was to die for.....so soft it just melts in your mouth......even the crust! It wasn't crumbly or to dense, just light and fluffy!  I made it to go with the homemade soup I was making for dinner and it was perfect........my husband couldn't get enough! He ate three slices, in addition to the soup! I will definitely be making this one again!!

YUMMY!  This was my first attempt at bread and it came out wonderful.  So easy too.  I had to add about 3 tablespoons of flour because the dough was pretty sticky, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

The texture of this bread is soft and the crust is not flaky - it's easily the best bread maker recipe I've used. I do like the Portuguese recipe here too but it's too sweet for sandwiches. This recipe makes a great big loaf and is tasty with tuna fish or roast beef. This recipe is a keeper.

This bread was very good and super easy to make. I had the dough rise and kneaded in the bread machine. For the third rising, I heated the oven to about 200 degrees, let some of the hot air out of the oven and then transferred the dough from the machine into the greased bread pan and let it rise in the oven for 30 minutes. I then baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and half way through I buttered the top portion of the bread. It was good and not that sweet.

This was wonderful hot, but the next day when sliced it was even better ! The texture was great the taste was great and it was easy to make. I am trying it with out the bread machine today ( i did add a little more flour after the first rise)and it looks pretty good so far, my dough is almost ready for the oven ! This is a keeper my family and friends will enjoy for years to come ! Thanks..........

My husband has been on me about eating white bread.  I usually try to make potato or some other "fancy" bread for his sandwiches.  I came across this recipe and it is going to be a staple in our house! My 5 year old loves it and so does my husband.

My wife and daughter absolutely loved this.  I thought it could use less sugar but it was still very good bread and it went quick in our house.  I don't own a bread machine but made it by hand and it turned out nice and fluffy with a very good crumb.

18 Tablespoons equals 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons. I use this conversion to save time when making my amish bread and it comes out perfect every time. This bread is very, very good if a bit sweet. My two kids finished off the loaf and then asked for more! I prefer to eat this bread warm with a little bit of real butter, but I think this would make an awesome grilled cheese or peanut butter and jelly sandwich as well.

I really love the advice for the extra rising. I ran it through the complete dough cycle on my bread machine (rises twice) then added more flour (was too wet) then ran through a complete basic cycle (rises twice more and bakes.) So I didn't have to pay attention to the beeps and get the add-ins on time or stop before the baking and restart. I added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed because I don't like my bread so white. It was good.

Made this yesterday using my kitchenAid...so easy, rose beautifully, and makes a light, fluffy, delicious bread. My breadhounds wiped out the whole loaf in about 15 minutes so I can't comment on how it works for toast, sandwiches, etc. I've armed myself with doubled calculations now, so hopefully I can keep 1 loaf and let my loveys devour the other.  I better start buying bread flour in bulk......  Thanks for a great recipe.

I don't really do "white breads"  but this is just sooo sooo GOOD! I have made this a bunch and will continue to do so. Perfect in thick slices or chunks as a dipping bread. Follow the recipe though! I have tried substuting in wheat flour, boosting nutritional content with ground flax, etc... it has not come out quite as yummy those times. One humid day it colapsed...I blame the humidity. Other than that it is sooooo delicious. Thank you!

This is the first bread recipe I ever made since it's so simple but it has been one of the bets I have ever made. Great with cream cheese. you might want to bump the salt up a bit and turn the crust to medium

Amazing! Thank you so much for sharing. My first successful loaf of bread out of my bread machine! My husband and son love it. I'll be baking more tomorrow for the freezer. I had to add a little more flour but didn't change anything. It has a nice sweet taste to it but you could cut down on the sugar if you don't like your bread sweet.

Beautiful!  Absolutely awesome!  This will be our family bread from now on.  I just got a bread machine and I have been testing different recipes without much success.  This bread by far is the best one. I even tested it both ways, in the machine and in the oven.  They both came out perfect.  I immediately put them in a sealed plastic bag and the crust is delicious.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This made good bread. Excellent fresh and straight from the oven. I don't really think it was nearly as good the next day, but I think that's just my opinion about homemade bread. This bread does have a sweet flavor. I loved it!

This was really good bread, just a little denser than I usually like. You will need to put aluminum foil over the top about halfway through baking to prevent over-browning though. I thought it was done and took it out too soon, which caused the underdone middle to fall and it was just really dense and gooey in that section. That was totally my fault though, nothing bad about the recipe. The taste overall was great, just a hint of sweetness. Thanks for a great recipe! Maybe next time I will do better!

Thanks so much for this recipe. I recently got a new bread machine and have been trying different recipes. This one is the best so far! So moist and soft in the middle with a crispy crust. Delicious!

While this bread came out sweet, tasty,and moist, I thought it was too dense.  I am, however, a novice at bread-making, since this is only my 5th loaf ever.

I did not do the extra rise and the bread came out perfect!  I used 1 cup plus 2 Tablespoons of water, but then had to add a small amount of flour to the dough while it was mixing.  That was the only adjustment I made to the recipe.  YUMMY!!

This was good bread.  The first time I made it it was way to sweet for my tastes, the kids liked it but wasn't a favorite.  But I tried it again and cut the sugar down to about a Tablespoon and it was MUCH better!  Great with some cream cheese spread on or made into french toast!

My husband and children just love this bread.  I wait until it is done in my bread machine, then take it out and let it raise for about 45 min.  I then slice pieces of the dough about 2 1/2 inches by 2 1/2 inches and pull each piece just a bit to make it a bit flatter. I then put it in a pan that has been heated on medium with a bit of olive oil (just enough to cover the bottom of pan).  This is similar to Pan Bread and my children think that it is a Treat to get it this way...sometimes I just make a loaf of bread out of this recipe. Doesn't really matter how you make it, it is soooooooooooooo YUMMY!!!

Followed the recipe exactly & bread turned out perfectly. Sliced very nicely. This is a sweeter bread similiar to Hawaiian bread. I've been experimenting w/ different bread machine recipes on this site and all have been good, but my husband and kids really liked this one.

I liked this bread a lot. I made it in the bread machine and it turned out beautifully the first time- a nice golden brown. I made no changes, made it as is. It IS a sweeter bread, but personally we liked that. Also, LOVE the fact that it stayed fresh very well compared to many other recipes I have tried. It did not get hard in the least on the leftover portions and that was with the family in and out of it all day.

I have made this bread three times since finding the recipe a little over a week ago.  Perfect texture.  Slices great.  Rises up beautifully.  A bit too sweet for us as written - I reduce the sugar by half.  Will be making many, many more times!

I had never tried a recipe like this with the oil before - this was an incredibly moist and rich bread, similar to our Easter bread but heavier.  Definitely a keeper!

Despite my defective bread machine (kept resetting on 1 mode) this bread turned out great. Good texture, nice crust. I will cut back on the sugar next time, a little too sweet for me.

This bread was so good!  We couldn't even wait for it to cool off before we slathered on some butter and had a piece.  I did have to add a little more flour..but not very much.

Mine didn't turn out so nice. The taste was fine, but try as I did I couldn't turn off my bread machine to get it to start over. I'm sure it would be a very good bread if I had a better machine.

I tried this in the bread machine, and I don't think it came out as light as it should have. Good flavor though.

My husband is allergic to preservatives and food dyes.  So, we have to make all of his food from scratch.  This bread is the best we have found.  We love it.  If your bread comes out too crusty, you may want to try a different machine.  We have two.  Our Sunbeam made it too crusty, but our Westbend America's Favorite Bread Machine made the bread turn out like a loaf of Wonder bread.  We cook it, let it cool & then slice it and freeze it for sandwiches.  It is also good straight out of the machine. We are very grateful to you for submitting this recipe.  God bless you!

Excellent and easy recipe. Today will be my 4th time to make it, I'm hoping to actually have some left for dinner. My kids and hubbie eat it as soon as I take it out of the bread machine. E-mailed this to a friend in England, and she loves it as well.

Both of my boys loved this bread, they said it stayed soft.Last year by lunch thier bread was hard. Myself I found it light and fluffy but it rose very high so I had a hard time cutting it. Overall I found a new favorite bread.

I love this recipe!  It turned out so good.  I'm a beginner and don't know much about baking bread, but this was perfect.  The flavor was great, it had a good density, and was very moist.  My 3 year old kept asking for more!
