This tasted really good and it was a hit but I'm not sure if it turned out or not.  The cake rose beautifully in the oven and about 15 minutes of cooling it fell.  Is it supposed to do that?  As good as it tasted I would make it again though.

This recipe is simple and should taste excellent, but I am not a big coffee/chocolate fan and this has a very strong coffee taste to it.  Has anyone tried it without the coffee?

Delicious and chocolaty cake. I used milk instead of water though. This cake rose quite a bit while it baked and then fell right back down. As per another reviewer's advice I made this cake a few days in advance of serving. The cake practically melted in my mouth. Delicious. Thanks.

I misread this recipe and only used 3 eggs!  Due to this mistake, I have no idea what the texture is supposed to be like...mine came out like a cross between a mousse and ganache.  Accordingly, it was somewhat difficult to slice and serve.  I will use more eggs the next time I make it...but since another reviewer called it "eggy," I probably won't use all 8.

Despite my mistake, the end result was rich, decadent and had a heavenly flavor.  The balance of chocolate to coffee was very nice.  I will definitely make this again.

Yummy. This was really good. Kind of a cross between a brownie and the inside of a truffle. Rich chocolaty goodness. I did use coffee instead of water, it didn't give it a coffee flavor just enhanced the chocolate. Just a little tip before you just dump the eggs into the hot chocolate mix take a little of the chocolate and beat it into the eggs to bring up the temp of the eggs so they don't scramble on you. I used a gravy ladle to add about 1/2 cup of the chocolate into the eggs. I topped with whipped cream and a berry sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Pretty awesome, and this from someone who doesn't like chocolate all that much... I made two tiny cakes- basically 1/4 the recipe, and that was enough chocolatly goodness to last me a month. To answer an earlier reviewer, my husband doesn't like coffee, so I left that out of the mix, only to find it VERY watery... so I kept adding powdered cocoa and a *little* flour, until I thought it was the right texture. I couldn't begin to tell you how much I added- just a little at a time, until it looked right. So yes, you can do without the coffee, and it tastes fabulous.

This cake had a wonderful rich chocolate flavor but was way to "eggy" tasting for me.

Loved this!  I liked the crusty edges right out of the oven (but left them in the interest of serving to my family without looking like the birds had been after it).  After 2 days in the frig, this was like eating fudge.  Unfortunately, mine was a little grainy, but that was my fault.  Maybe not a bad idea to pour the batter through a sieve on the way to the pan in case the eggs have not been tempered correctly.  As for flavor, none of us noticed any egginess or strong coffee flavor, just rich chocolate.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This was really really good, but be warned it is best after being refrigerated for more than a day. I made it for some gluten free friends and couldn't in good conscience serve it when I tasted it after having it refrigerated overnight, but after a full 24 hours in the fridge it was good, but the next day it tasted fantastic, much better with age this one.

The only thing that would make this better is using chocolate whipped cream.

I made this exactly as written.  I took it to a family Christmas party and it was raved about by everyone.  Many people in the comments stated that the cake fell after cooking. Mine fell slightly but not much.  Very rich cake, with some homemade whipped cream this really does serve about 16.

This was a great recipe that was easy to put together.  The flavor is great and while it is very rich the texture is light enough that it really does seem like a mousse cake.

This turned out decadent and delicious. I used 3 cups of semi sweet chocolate chip morsels for my chocolate, turned out wonderful. Definitely a keeper I will make this again when I need a rich and decadent chocolate treat.

I have made this many times and it always makes a fantastic, delicious chocolate dessert.  Super easy to make.  It is VERY rich so I halve the recipe and it makes plenty since a little goes a long way.  I never put in the coffee and it works fine without. 
The batter is very watery but it bakes up firm in about 50 minutes. I also recommend leaving it overnight in the fridge if possible. I cover it with a chocolate ganache and chocolate whipped cream, but you may want to go with regular sweetened whipped cream as it is very chocolatey. 
Once I covered it with a ganache and sprinkled chocolate shavings on top and brought it to a friend's birthday (she's gluten free) at a restaurant. The server was so impressed he asked if I would be interested in making the cake for the restaurant to serve!  That's how good it is!

Winner Passover dessert! Sweet only scratches the surface of the rich chocolate flavor served up in this cake. The attendees at the Sedar where I served this cake were all in agreement that this chocolate cake is a must for next year. It turned out great following the recipe, no changes. I don't do a lot of baking, don't even own a springform pan, so be assured that lots of skill is not required and you'll WOW the crowd if you bring this rich, dense cake to a Sedar. Thanks for posting this cake recipe!
