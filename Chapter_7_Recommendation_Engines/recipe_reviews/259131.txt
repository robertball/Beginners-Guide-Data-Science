I used firm tofu with a bit of flax seed milk in place of silken (blended), uses flax seed milk instead of soy, used cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and a bit of ginger and cardamom (not traditional pumpkin pie spice but I love cardamom). I also subbed agave for maple syrup for about 1/2 cup because I ran out of maple syrup.

This made 2 pies for me.

Not sweet enough. Needed other spices for more traditional flavor. This was super bland. A waste of good crust
