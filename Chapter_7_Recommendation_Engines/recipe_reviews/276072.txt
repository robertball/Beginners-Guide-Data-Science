So tasty! I think next time I would make 2 smaller pies, only because I couldn't get the lid on. Very good and very simple! Bonus points for being a make ahead dessert.

I filled 8 tartlet shells, for 4 dinner guests and I filled a small graham cracker crust pie shell with the remaining batter.  I have frozen the pie for later use.  This is slightly lighter than a regular cheesecake and very tasty.
