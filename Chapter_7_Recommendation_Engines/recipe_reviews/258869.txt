Hmmm, this one was tough to rate because while we like all the ingredients, the proportions of the spices combined with no 'sauce'  was off for us. I ended up using less of all the spices and just used them to taste, passing more crushed pepper flakes at the table for whoever wanted it. After mixing everything together it was beyond dry, so I added in a can of chicken broth and heated the whole thing through...The family LOVED it! I have to Thank the submitter for the idea, which became a new family favorite, but IMO, it needs some tweaks.

This recipe definitely needed some tweaking.  I added more butter, saved some of the liquid from the cooked pasta and boiled it with a bouillon cube before adding the rest of the ingredients.  When it was finished, it was good but I changed the recipe quite a bit.

Christina's suggestion to add chicken broth made all the difference.  I followed the recipe and added chicken broth to the pot at the end when mixing. Really good. Be sure to add the red pepper; that gives this dish great flavor without being too spicy.

I didn't grill my chicken and I omitted the red pepper flakes but, otherwise, I made this recipe exactly as it said.

Honestly, it's not written well and it does need some changes.

I knew the amount of pepper was going to be too much (you can't really say that you said "to taste" because the variance shouldn't so drastic) but I used that much anyway. It overpowered pretty much every other flavour in the dish. I ate the food half an hour ago and my mouth is still tingling from how much pepper was in there. Most recipes have a ratio of 4:1 for salt and pepper. So the amount of pepper in this one should have been 1/4 tsp. That would have been much better.

In addition, the ingredients say that the chicken should be cut but it should only say that if you cut it before you cook it or if your ingredients say that the chicken should be grilled and you omit that step from the instructions.

I might consider making this recipe again but I'd drastically reduce the pepper so that I might be able to taste any of the other flavours.
