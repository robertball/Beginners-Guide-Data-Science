Cheesecakemama, you are a total rockstar. I made this tonight for my boys and I and this was the first night in the longest that all three of them were quiet and ate their dinner without complaint. I had some leftover Boilermaker Tailgate Chili that I used in this and I had some XXL hot dogs and Sara Lee bread I had bought on the cheap at my local discount grocery store. Quick and easy supper and most easy on the wallet. My family was so happy. Thanks so much. NOTE: I used a pizza cutter to cut the bread and hot dogs into smaller pieces for my boys before I added chili. I also boiled my hot dogs.

We love chili dogs, that's what we call these! I used homemade chili, basic recipe, and they are just great. I did use hot dog buns, but my boyfriend really seems to like using bread too. The onion is a must for us, it really adds so much to these hot dogs. Thanks cheesecakemama for posting this, it is a classic :)

This is mine and I am so glad you are all enjoying the comfort food.  I don't microwave my hot dogs, not sure why AR put that on there.  I either grill, pan fry or we have one of those hot dog toasters.  Its suppose to be 1 tbs mustard also.  Kick it up with some dijon if you like also.  :)

Great way to have chili dogs when you dont' have buns!!! I boiled my dogs in water and used a can of chili with NO beans. I only had sliced deli cheese so I placed a slice on each piece of bread then the hot dogs mustard chili raw onion. Super easy and super good. I would use the microwave directions if I made this at work for lunch..

I love this!! This is my favorite way to eat a chilie dog, with a fork! It is messy and I don't want to waste any of the drippy goodness on my shirt front! You have to try the mustard with this, it gives the chilie extra Zing! MMMM Thanks CCM, Miss seeing you on the board!

What a cool way to use up the leftover chili! I was a little worried the kids would turn their noses up at it but they loved it. My husband went nuts over this dish asking to have it again after chili night! Thanks for the great idea!

i upped the servings to 3 and used easy chili 1 from this site. my little girl loved this my husband was a harder sell but in the end he said i could make this again. i did up the onions a little bit and put jala[penos on mine and my husbands. solid recipe, easy and not fussy and just what i was looking for when i was stressed and tired of eating chili and cornbread.

I was looking for a way to use up leftover chili from Sunday, and this was perfect! I wasn't sure about the mustard on top, but it works out nicely, giving the overall meal a little "zip." This is a great starting point to use and then let your creativity take over. Next time, I'll top with some sour cream and jalapeno slices. Well done, thanks!

I would agree with another reviewer and say this is indeed comfort food at its best. We make these all the time, especially on rainy days. Thanks.

You almost have a Frito Chili Dog Pie. 2 slices of bread, hot dogs sliced in half  lengthwise, Fritos, chili and top with grated cheese and chopped onion.   LOL. This is a combination of a Frito pie and a chili dog and my kids and grandkids love it.

I'm making this dish right now! Instead of hot dogs, I'm boiling Carolina Pride Hot Links. Sliced white onions are sauteeing in olive oil as I type. It's going to be GOOD!

What can be any better than using leftover chili on a nice grilled dog? Tater tots on the side. :)

Easy, quick lunch using leftovers . . .what could be better?  Not gourmet but who cares.  I have leftover chili so I just pulled some hot dogs from the freezer and voila!  Instant lunch!  I did grill my hot dogs . . I like them best that way or pan fried, and left off the onions since we're not huge fans.  I left mustard off bf's but put it on mine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is favorite Saturday fun meal at our home. I offer tabasco for heat and serve it with chips and root bear floats.

Very tasty. I boiled the hot dogs instead of microwaving them. I had to make this because of the name. It was fun telling my family what we were having for dinner! I did leave off the mustard though. Thanks!
