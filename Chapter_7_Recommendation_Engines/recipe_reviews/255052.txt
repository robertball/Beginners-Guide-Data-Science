I had this soup at a local restaurant and was looking for a way to re-create it.  I am also moving and wanted to use up some cans I had in the pantry, so I made a totally canned version.  I sauteed about two teaspoons of basil and about a tablespoon of garlic in two teaspoons of olive oil, added a can of diced tomatoes, 2/3 of a can of concentrated tomato soup and about 2/3 of a can of artichoke hearts (drained and cut up).  I heated it through and then added about half a cup of half and half.  Heated till warm.  I did add a little salt at the table.  This soup was AMAZING!!!  It was even better the next day when the flavors had time to settle!  I am sure taking the time to follow the recipe will give you a great soup, but the easy way was great too!  I would not puree this soup as the chunks of artichoke and diced tomatoes give it great flavor and texture.

This recipe was delicious and simple!  We replaced some of the half and half with 2% milk to reduce the fat content and didn't miss it.  I recommend waiting until the soup is in the bowls to add the Parmesan cheese, otherwise it sticks to the pan and serving spoon.

This is delicious! Use a stick blender to make it really easy and less messy. Just blend all ingredients (before you add milk or cream and cheese) in the pot. Then add milk or cream and cheese. I use frozen artichoke heart slices (Trader Joe’s and Safeway sell decent version) and it always comes out great—my family actually cheers when I tell them I’m making this.

The flavor of this soup was outstanding! I am wondering, however, if there are differing  quality levels of  canned artichoke hearts.  The ones I got seemed to have a lot of leaves attached but I followed the recipe, chopped them and put them in to simmer. Unfortunately,  blending the soup did not break down the artichoke leaf fiber and the texture of the soup was, well,  fuzzy. Not pleasant to eat.  The flavor was so good I think I will  make this soup again but without the artichokes.

I used frozen artichokes but they were a little stringy. Might try the jar next time but this was soooo good!
