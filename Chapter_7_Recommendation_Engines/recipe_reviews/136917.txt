Ohhhhhhhh, decadence.  A mile-high version of the traditional French Silk Pie (see other recipe on this site).   It seems to be updated, calling for pasteurized eggs or egg substitute, but I'm not intimidated by raw eggs, so I just used four fresh, large eggs (and lived to tell about it without incident).  As you beat it, it gets fluffier and fluffier, as well as lighter in color.  For color and taste I thought an Oreo cookie crust might be even better, so I made a crust of 24 regular-size Oreo cookies and 1/4 cup melted butter.  Had I used a traditional pie crust I might have liked this with one more square of melted chocolate.  Very rich, so cut slices accordingly.  This is most likely why the French Silk Pie recipe I'm used to calls for half this amount of filling (and then of course you bury it under a couple inches of whipped cream). I garnished this with fresh whipped cream, raspberries, and mini chocolate chips.  And as it turned out, I found I actually do prefer the pie with the Oreo crust.

Couldn't stop licking the bowl, utensils, etc. this is so good...with my changes....I only added 3 eggs and I added another ounce of chocolate because I wanted a more chocolatey, dense pie.  I used the paddle attachment on my stand mixer for everything except eggs-then switched to wire whip and beat on high. Filled a premade baked pie crust just fine.

Great recipe! I too did this with raw eggs and everything seemed to work out just fine. I was just very careful with watching my temperatures.   The kids loved this one too. I'll be making this again for sure!

Ok, made this again, and this time I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup (to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup), and it came out even better. My daughter said the first go, at full sugar, was too sweet. I cut it back and it still got raves. I'll have to try it at 1/2 cup and see what that does. Still an excellent pie.

Wow!!!! This was absolutly amazing! I was a bit worried while making this that it wasn't going to turn out, because upon tasting it it tasted grainy. After adding the eggs this was much better. I used a pre-made Keebler shortbread pie crust. I didn't have any chocolate squares, so I melted 1 tbsp shortening with 3 tbsp cocoa for each oz. of chocolate. Update 1/22/12, I have made this pie several times and it is always amazing. I recently made it again and used egg substitute and it ruined my pie! They would not blend into the rest of the ingredients and it turned my filling into a cottage cheese like filling, wound up throwing it out! From here on out I will always use real eggs!!!

I have made this several times.  It is one of my husband's very favorite desserts.   I have tried it with a rolled out crust and with crumb crust and by far a chocolate cookie crust is best with this recipe.   I was amazed that this recipe didn't get all 5 stars.  It is smooth, silky and beyond description delicious.   I read the reviews here and on the Pillsbury site and I think the problems come from  substituting ingredients and from not following the order exactly.  Never use margarine and never use egg substitutes.  The chemistry won't work if you make substitutions.   Egg substitutes don't have yolks in them.    Yolks act as emulsifiers and yolks are what turn the granulated sugar into spun silk.   I also suspect that people aren't beating the mixture for a full 2 minutes between each egg which adds up to whole 8 minutes of beating.   I use my Kitchen Aid mixer and a timer.  I scrape my bowl down after each egg and after 2 eggs I take the beater out and carefully scraped down the bowl even more throughly.  It is the beating along with those yolks that make this pie perfectly silky.  If the filling is gritty then you probably didn't beat the batter enough between adding eggs enough or you substituted ingredients.   I used pasteurized shell eggs as suggested.  That is not the same as egg beaters!  You need real shell eggs not anything from a carton.  If you can't find them, I maintain that it is better to wash and dry your eggs because the contaminates are on the shell.

Awesome! I made 4 pies from this recipe.  The first two were very soup like.  I was using what I thought was butter but it was margarine!  When I got it right and used the butter, it was divine!

Love, Love, Love. I did a store-bought Oreo crust, 4 ounces of Ghirardelli chocolate, and covered the whole thing in whipped cream and grated some Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate for garnish. I whipped the butter and sugar with the paddle on my KitchenAide stand mixer, and used the whisk for the chocolate and eggs. I beat the eggs for at least 5 mins each, and the pie set like a dream! I smothered it in whipped cream (1 1/2 cups whipping cream, 2 T. sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla). It turned out smooth, rich, creamy, wonderful! Can't wait to bring this to a party! I will never go to Baker's Square again!

Loved it! Only suggestion would be to separate the eggs, blending in the yolks as called for but whipping up the whites then gently folding them in for increased volume.

I put in 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1 tsp raspberry extract Put in 4 oz of chocolate (which was 12 T cocoa powder and 4 T melted shortening w butter flavor) (along w the butter and sugar) and painted a crust w melted milk choc chips and let cool before filling. A dream pie. Loved it.

I made 4 French silk pies to compare and get the best recipe.  This was the worst by far!  Think of making cookies....butter, sugar, eggs.  Now take that mixture and put it in the fridge.  That is what this recipe is, other than a little cream and chocolate added. I would give zero stars if I could.

Awesome pie. I made this for a church dinner and everyone who ate it LOVED it! I made to pies, one exactly as the recipe calls for and the other one I had to use cocoa powder and shortening for the unsweetened chocolate.  Both were great, I just can't express how good this pie is.

For those of you who don't want to risk the (granted, very small) issues with raw eggs, it's very easy to pasteurize eggs yourself. Just add eggs to a pan of water, and heat over medium heat to 140 degrees. Hold at 140 for 3 minutes for large eggs, 5 minutes for jumbo (don't go much above 140 or you'll have soft boiled eggs). Pull off heat and immediately run under cold water. I have small children so this is how I handled the eggs. 

For the pie-it turned out very nice! I followed the recipe closely, although I only had semi-sweet chocolate (Guittard). I upped the chocolate to 4 oz, and dropped the sugar about a quarter cup. 

I personally liked the amount this added to the crust. I used a deep dish pie crust. If I made it again I might add a couple Tbsp of cocoa or something like that because it just wasn't *quite* chocolate-y enough, but I like very dark, not very sweet chocolate. 

For this recipe I would NOT use egg beaters, and of course you can't use margarine. If your chocolate was too warm when you add it, you're probably going to run into issues.

There are no words to describe this incredible pie! I have had several French Silk Pies in my life but none of them compare to this one. The texture is incredible and the taste divine... and I'm not even a chocolate person! 

TIPS:
1. CRUST- I used a store-bought, pre-made, non-refrigerated chocolate pie crust (not Oreo). It was an excellent choice and added a great taste and texture.

2. MEASUREMENTS- Make sure to only fill the pie 1/2  or 3/4 at the most with the mousse. The rest will be whipped cream, which balances the richness of the mousse. Apply the whipped cream right before serving. I sprinkled milk chocolate chips on the top.

3. I HIGHLY recommend filling both pie crusts with the mousse right away and not leaving any extra mousse in the bowl to refrigerate overnight. I made the mistake of only filling 1 pie and then leaving the rest of the mousse for a second pie the next day and the texture was TOTALLY different. Once you fill the pie with the mousse, it's fine to refrigerate the pie and cover with foil. You just don't want to refrigerate only the mousse in a bowl overnight. The texture becomes much more dense and not as decadent. The texture is 50% of what makes this pie so amazing, so I highly recommend taking this particular piece of advice.

I think everyone who's considering making this recipe absolutely should. You'll be so glad you did.

This recipe is delicious. My husband, not a 'sweets' kind of guy, will nearly devour this thing in one sitting. I've now made it several times and tweak it accordingly. 
Firstly, I use a graham cracker crust. I make my own (2 c graham cracker crumbs, 1 TB butter, 1 TB sugar, dash of cinnamon, bake at 350 for 8 minutes), but you can also buy one. I've gotten fancy and started lining the crust with chocolate chips before pouring the batter.  
I also make it with 6 eggs. Be sure to WHIP WHIP WHIP between each egg. I cannot stress the importance of beating thoroughly - it's what makes the recipe.
Finally, I'll use a homemade whipped cream - I think the difference is well worth the extra effort. Using the whip attachment, beat 1 1/2 c heavy whipping cream on medium-high. Add 1/4 c powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla about 30-45 seconds into whipping. Whip for several minutes until it's thick and forms peaks, but do not overwhip or else you'll end up with a hunk of sweetened butter.

I have made this pie so many times that I don't have to check the recipe anymore. It is the family favorite. I have perfected it in a few ways for our family. Firstly, I use a homemade graham cracker crust instead of the baked pie crust (store bought works, too, but homemade is better - I use graham cracker crust I from this website). Secondly, I use homemade whipped cream. It's so easy and so much better. Just beat heavy whipping cream until it gets stiff and add a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple tablespoons of confectioner's sugar (depending on how sweet you want it). This pie doesn't last more than 24 hours in my house every time I make it.

This is wonderful.  Made it for the first time last night, left it in the refrigerator overnight and had it for lunch today.  I used real butter and a store bought Oreo crust and beat it for a long time.  It came out perfect, very smooth and creamy.  Worth the mixer time!

The pie was easy to make at face value, however I made two and the first one didn't set and was rather runny. The second one set well and I had no problems. It was very tasty for those who love chocolate, however it was a little too sweet for my liking.

This is a wonderful chocolatey pie.  Followed others suggestions and reduced the sugar to 3/4 Cup and increased the chocolate to 5 oz total.  Used a frozen pie crust as my homemade ones don't turn out well.  Definately fill the pie crusts immediately after mixing as the filling will harden in the container you store it in and is unusable.  Have made this twice now - both times there was nothing left.  Hope I get to taste the next one!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I LOVE CHOCOLATE!! I'm giving it 5 stars even tho I had a problem with the recipe.   I made this using 1 cup egg product, which began to separate and bleed out the chocolate as I worked in the 2nd half cup.  I should have used only 1/2 cup as it was setting up fine with that, but I thought 1 cup was the eqivalent  of 4 eggs - WRONG!!  I can't get pasteurized eggs where I live.  The flavor was great and it is VERY RICH; my husband who is not the chocolate fiend that I am, even thought it was good, regardless of the foo-pah.
SECOND DAY - I'm sorry I need to reduce my rating from 5 to 3 stars.  After my pie had setup overnight it had become crumbly and was no longer 'silky'.  The flavor was still good, but the texture was grainy with undissolved sugar.  I probably will not make it again.

I used a homemade crust with Ghirardelli chocolate and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (I prefer it a bit less sweet). You absolutely must use real butter, softened, but not melted! 

You can pasteurize your own eggs by placing them in water on a stovetop. Using a digital thermometer, slowly heat the pot up to 140F and hold for 3 whole minutes. Rinse with cold water. (Be sure to save this trick for your favorite chocolate mousse recipe as well!)

Just watch out. This pie goes from your mouth straight to your thighs, but oh, it is worth it!

I make a very similar version, provided by my high school french teacher. It calls for only 3/4 cup butter and 3 eggs. Also, my version has 1 whole teaspoon of vanilla. In France, you would use two tablespoons of brandy...nom nom!

I decided to make a chocolate pie one day and came across this recipe. It came out perfect and was gone in a day. My whole family loved this pie. It has been a request every time I say i will make a pie. So far we have made 6 of them and I have made the recipes as directed and never had a problem with it at all. Would rate it higher in stars but I just can't do it.

I have been looking for this recipe for almost 20 years.  It was someone's 'secret' recipe that they refused to give me, but I recognized it the minute I saw it.  This is why they invented the Internet.  This pie is divine, easily one of my favorites.  However, it is super rich, so you need to invite people over to enjoy this with you.
Last time I made it I used Giradelli baking chocolate, but it's pretty much the same.

Made this for my boyfriend and he said it was the second best he's ever had (the first being his 80 yo grandmother's, I can't compete with that:) 

It's gotten rave reviews from everyone else who's tried it too.  I use the big Keebler pre-made graham cracker crust and it's just the right amount of filling.  Also I think it tastes better with cool whip that Reddi-whip on top.  

Make sure you use a HUGE mixing bowl and butter instead of margarine.  Otherwise, the recipe is pretty much foolproof, and a major crowd pleaser.

Made a couple changes (graham cracker crust instead of regular, 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp almond extracts & egg beaters instead of raw egg). Came out amazing!! Overfilled the 9 inch pie crust so we are some as mousse. Delicious!! A keeper!

This recipe is perfect as is for me. I've never made a french silk before and I probably wont go searching for a new one. A lot of the reviewers state that egg beaters won't work with this recipe, but my store didn't have pasteurized eggs and I was making this specifically for my little nieces. I didn't want to take any chances so I used the egg beaters. It turned out perfectly creamy and whipped. High peaks, silky texture, delicious flavor. At first I was afraid the sugar granules wouldn't dissolve, but by the fourth "egg" it was silky smooth. Excellent. 
PS- When I make this strictly for me and my hubby, I'm going to use real eggs to see how big of a difference it makes. I'm not too worried about it, but I'd be pretty bummed if my nieces got sick from my cooking! o.o

Just keep whipping. Just keep whipping.  Oh my, I thought I had ruined this. I was using 1/2 dark sweet choc and 1/2 milk choc chips so reduced the sugar to 1/4 c. I also added the vanilla to the butter first by mistake and had the cottage cheese appearance even with the 5 minute beat between the eggs. So I just left it whipping for about 20 minutes more and voila, it is perfect.  Don't give up, just keep whipping!

I make it just as is and seriously LOVE it. I made it for Thanksgiving a few years ago and get requests to make it every year. Our personal preference is to do it in an Oreo crust, but it really is great either way. The only other change is that we use 1/2 cup 60% Cocoa Ghirardelli chips. One caution: make sure you mix the sugar until dissolved! Otherwise it's gritty.

This was a really good silk pie recipe. It's very rich and tasty. The amount of filling was perfect for 1 pie, and I followed the directions exactly for whipping time. The only complaint I have is that it would be much better with a graham cracker or cookie crust instead of regular pie shell. I'll try it that way next time.

This pie was delicious made with semi-sweet chocolate chips, Splenda & Egg Beaters. To do it my way, measure a cup of cold water into a 2 cup measure, add butter to the 2 cup mark, pour off the water, & zap it. I accidentally melted the butter instead of softening it & I had no chocolate squares, so used chocolate chips (a little less than a cup to add more chocolate flavor). Add a little of the melted butter & zap to melt the chips. (If I make the pie this way again, I'll experiment with melting all the butter & the chocolate chips together & then adding them to the sugar/Splenda.) Let this cool while mixing the "butter/sugar". I used Splenda, a bit less  than the sugar the recipe calls for, put it & the butter into the mixer bowl & whipped 'til frothy. Add the chocolate chips to the butter/sugar mixture, then add a cup of egg substitute, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, then add the vanilla & whip the mixture to soft peaks. I thought it needed more chocolate, so measured out another almost-full cup of chips & a little whip cream, preparatory to zapping them so I could add them to the mix, but when I turned around, the mixture had already started to set up! I poured it into the pie shell, and made a ganache* out of the additional chips. I spread this on the top of the pie, refrigerated for several hours, then topped with whipped cream. Wonderful!

* See Chocolate Ganache by IngrideVogel on this site for a proper way to make this.

Wow! I've never made a chocolate pie like this before, and it turned out great. I would have given it 5 stars, but I did add an extra ounce of chocolate, because, well, the more the merrier! 
The only word of caution I have is make sure you have a decent mixer. I was using a little single-beater hand held electric, and I swear I almost burnt it out a couple times with all the mixing that was required. I gave it a minute to rest in between adding eggs, but it still got really hot.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be just slightly grainy, so I will use powdered sugar next time.  The addition I made was whipped 1/4 cup of heavy cream and folded it into the filling when it was done.  This pie is out of this world, and in my opinion better than restaurant french silk pie!

This is a regular family request.  I use egg product in place of eggs.  As others have said, make sure to whip the heck between eggs. At least 2 min between.  (I use thirds with the egg product.)

One of my favorite pies! EVER!!!
I made it three times in 2 months and it came out perfect both times. I made it a fourth time a couple months later, and had just gotten my electric stand mixer, but this time it didn't set. So I made it again, that same day, and it still didn't set. I gave up and ate it like pudding pie, still tasted fantastic. haven't made it in a few months, because of what happened, but I would still recommend using this recipe. Next time I will try reverting back to the original electric mixer, and see how the recipe turns out. Definitely a must-have recipe!

Wow!  Absolutely amazing!  The directions were easy to follow and yielded a very silky, smooth pie.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he LOVED it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Our family always has a french silk pie for every holiday.  When my sister and I dropped the ball on buying on we decided to make one.  This recipe made a GREAT pie!  So delicious.  Just the right amount of richness.

A really great pie! It was the first pie tin to be emptied and everyone wanted another piece.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more than 3 oz of the chocolate to the filling, it was good, but not quite as chocolatey as I prefer.

This was completely delicious! Although I didn't realize until I was almost done making it that is calls for raw egg. I guess I could have done something about that, but no bother. One important substitution was subbing the pie crust for a chocolate graham cracker crusts, super good.

This recipe is ridiculously easy and is pure heaven! My mom and I always get a slice of French Silk pie at Baker's Square on our Christmas shopping trip and started to look for a similar recipe and this is probably the best.

OMG! I loved it. Tho' it seems to be more like a Swiss buttercream recipe. :D Whatev'. I ended up doubling the recipe (fit fine in a 5qt Kitchen Aid w/ a paddle) added two more squares (wasn't going to use them for anything else so why not?) and left one pie plain and added peppermint oil to the other both, w/ an Oreo crust. So tasty. Tho' the recipe made quite a bit of filling for two little ol' 9 inches. All most overflowing. But whatev'. Hehe. More for me.

Rich and so easy to make! It tastes best the next day after the sugar has had time to dissolve. I pasteurized the eggs with a sous vide.

I knew this would not turn out right as I was making it, but I ignore years of baking experience and followed the recipe.  First, adding cooled chocolate to cold butter, and then adding cold eggs, is a terrible idea.  Then, adding the sugar to the butter instead of the chocolate, also a bad idea.  The sugar remained grainy, the chocolate hardened into multiple little unsweetened chocolate pieces in the pie.  The flavor was blah.   I am not sure if using room temperature whole eggs instead of cold pasteurized product would have made a difference or not, but as its written, this is NOT a French silk pie, it is a bland chocolate cream pie at best.  I am confused by the positive reviews, have these people never had a French silk pie before?

I added one egg and added chocolate  nesquick to the whipping cream to make chocolate whipped cream.
This is my daughters favorite for her birthday. Follow the directions carefully to make sure it turns out creamy and fluffy, not sugary. Very rich and sweet. Perfect for a special occasion.

OMG this is awesome.  I used 4 squares of chocolate and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.  I used my kitchenade and it did all the work.  The trick to this recipe is beating it long enough .. and oh I pasteurized my eggs just to be sure.

When i made this item i already thought that there were to many eggs which was correct. It tasted great but to sweet it just hit you in the mouth which bypasses the silk part of french silk pie. So to make this better i dropped 1/3 cup of sugar and used only 2 eggs came out much better. This recipe was a great baseline.

This is so good. I tasted the filling to make sure it wasn't gritty and it was so good I licked the bowl! Fed it to my family who loved it. My son- in-law ate two slices.  Then requested it for his birthday. Said he had never tasted one he loved so much.

Followed the recipe as stated and it turned out fantastic.  All three of my girls (wife included), were willing to fight each other to the death for more of this pie.  Will definitely come in handy later on as I am the only male in the house.

Wonderful pie!! Make sure your chocolate is cooled enough or it will melt your butter/sugar base and you will wind up with soup. It will seem gritty but add the eggs, one at a time, and be sure to set a timer if need be for two minutes for each egg! I’ve made this several times but this time I followed another reviewers advice and added the yolks one at a time and whipped the whites together for a few minutes until peaks formed and then added to the mixture and the pie was even higher!! This one is a family favorite and I’ve made it so many times I can get by without the recipe. We’ve alternated crusts and they’re all good in their own way. My personal favorite is graham cracker crust with a pinch of cinnamon but my husband prefers homemade crust. We take turns.

Just perfect! I am a nervous cook, so I made it exactly as the directions said . Everyone was impressed! It wasn’t gritty from the regular sugar! One thing I did was put the chocolate mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes just to stiffen it up a bit:) Make this pie!!!

I used Ghiradelli Dark chocolate for mine instead of Hershey and it was phenomenal! I'm making this again for an upcoming party, and a few of us have some food sensitivities, so I'm going to try making it with a gluten free crust and coconut milk whipped cream. Here's hoping it goes over well again!

LOVED this recipe.  Easy to follow and put together.  I read reviews before I began.  I did reduce the sugar amount to 3/4c, used 3 JUMBO eggs instead of 4 (assuming recipe called for 4 large) and increased to 4 squares of chocolate for a richer chocolate flavor.  I doubled the whipping cream (adding 1-1/2 t powdered sugar) for topping and grated semi-sweet chocolate for top of whipping cream.  It turned out super tasty.

Loved this recipe for a quick French silk pie. The advice to reduce sugar to 3/4 c was helpful. I used unsweetened chocolate. Perfect sweetness and no grainy texture. Times may be helpful: whip butter 2-4 min to fluffy. Add sugar, whip another 5 min or so. fold in choc then add eggs for 2 min whip after each. unsalted butter at room temp was perfect, so a pinch of salt might help next time. enjoy!

I followed the directions except, I used plain ole farm eggs and I beat 5 full minutes after each addition. This was like a chocolate mouse pie!! So so good. I saw peoples reviews complaining about sugar crystals in it. The only reason this would have happened would of been from scraping the sides when getting the filling out after beating it, as crystals form on the sides above the mixture when using a stand up mixer. Will be making again as I made this for my Husband as I really do not eat sweets, umm, I ate 3 pieces lol

Excellent recipe! I made two the first time. One exactly like the recipe and one using  cocoa powder and butter as a substitute for the unsweetened chocolate becauss i ran out. The first was smoother than the cocoa powder one, but the second had a bit more chocolaty flavor. I would stick with the recipe. It melts in your mouth!

This is my favorite pie. I make with homemade whipped cream, adding a bit of real maple syrup and cinnamon to the whipped cream. I tend to use 4-oz of chocolate, but that’s because I love chocolate. I heat the eggs in 140 degree water for 3-minutes then run under cold water to pasteurize them. It’s amazing and if there’s extra filling left, it’s perfect to eat on the side! Everyone should make this pie

This recipe is amazing. I followed it exactly except for beating for about 5 minutes after each egg, and I made an Oreo crust. It made plenty of filling to fill the pie crust and it was smooth and creamy. It set perfectly and cut like a dream. This was a hit!! I highly recommend it and it will be added to my "faves" cookbook :)

This was soooo good! Made the filling as written but did buy an Oreo crust. I thought this was exceptionally easy, and will make again. The family gobbled it right up! I did make the mistake of grating chocolate instead of making chocolate curls...left my pie looking furry lol!

so i tried this recipe with Bakers unsweetened baking chocolate. I thought it was just a different brand.  i think it was the wrong chocolate all together.  the batter seemed way to bitter even with the  1 cup of sugar.  soooo i upped the sugar!! ??.  lol now it is palatable but def not what i was hoping for.  ugggh. so i rated it high because its an easy recipe and probably great without my error.  did anyone else do this?

This pie is easy, beautiful, super yummy and even better the next day.  It's a bit sweet so next time I'll cut back on the sugar.  I used real eggs and a spelt crust.  After reading reviews I cut this recipe in half for one pie, but next time I will use the full amount to try it.  It's a new family fave!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  ??

very easy to make, only 4 ingredients, for the filling more with crust unless you buy pre-made one. 

 The secret to a great and high volume French Silk is beating the  eggs after each addition, 1 at a tine about 5 mins apart, a stand mixer is  a necessity for this pie, unless you like standing and holding a hand mixer for about 20 mins .

Making this one again.

Delicious!! Family favorite, tried several recipes , this is the best! Make sure your chocolate is cooled or you will get a soupy texture from melting the butter.

This has been a family favorite of ours for years now. MUCH easier with a stand mixer than a hand mixer. I typically use a (don't tell!) store-bought graham cracker crust. If it's a holiday, I make some whipped cream and push it through the corner of a sandwich bag to decorate it kind of like the picture. The presentation is good enough for my packaged-food-loving extended family.

Love the recipe itself. If you double the recipe be sure to add two eggs in at a time in, if you don't you'll over beat the eggs and cause it to deflate and turn into soupy pie. You can still freeze it if you do and it still tastes great just not what I was going for

This was easy to make.  My eleven year old grand daughter made it.  I melted the chocolate for her.  In my opinion it was a little to sweet.  Just make the slices small and use a lot of whipped cream.

I made this for our Christmas dinner and we all loved it! It is very rich as French silk pie should be and this one provides plenty of filling so you should get quite a few pieces from one pie. I used a chocolate crust because I knew my little ones would like that and they did. Thanks Betty Cooper, your French Silk Pie will be on another one of our holiday tables!

I know the recipe said real butter was required for the best results but my granddaughter is allergic so I made this with Earth Balance vegan butter and it turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it and no one even guessed it was nondairy!

This is the French Silk Pie recipe from Pillsbury. My whole family loved it for Thanksgiving! This filled a regular 9-inch pie shell very much, so it probably could work with a deep-dish shell (and it would look more put-together). Wonderful!

Thanks to so many of you who gave helpful tips to make this pie so successful.  Using the whipping attachment on the mixer really saved the day.  I also used 1 teaspoon of almond extract in place of the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Wonderful flavor!  Just like a picture when done.  Will make again and again.

I used to frequent a place called "Baker's Square" that made the most amazing French Silk Pies, so when they closed down all their shops I was in serious withdrawal. I always told myself that I would find a recipe that was just as good. While I can't say this recipe is a copycat because really the flavor depends on the type/brand of chocolate you use (I used Sees semisweet chocolate) omg it turned out absolutely amazing. I used only 1/2 cup of butter which was an accident though a fortunate one after reading some of the reviews. It still tasted buttery and atop of a flaky butter crust it was the perfect amount of flavor. I also used pasteurized egg product because I have several small children in the house, and had no immediate resources for pasteurized eggs themselves. You can't even tell! Make sure your tools are cold when trying to beat the finished product, if its too warm (like my California house in the summer) stick the mixing bowl with the pie filling in the freezer for about 20 minutes and try again, mine whipped up beautifully then after sitting in the fridge overnight was perfectly fluffy. Amazing. Thank you.

This pie is so rich and decadent; I love it! I only used 3 eggs and it was still very fluffy. I beat for more than 2 minutes after each egg but I still couldn't escape the grittiness of the sugar. I also put it in a chocolate pie crust I made from  a Chocolate Cookery cookbook. Tastes great!

This recipe absolutely exceeded my expectations!  It was decadently delicious and so very easy to make.  My family loved it.  I used a pre-made chocolate cookie crust and Hershey's chocolate curls on top.  The only downside was that,unfortunately, I did have some trouble finding the pasteurized eggs in our grocery stores when I needed them.
This recipe will likely become a Valentine's Day tradition around our house.  I would rename it "Chocolate Truffle Pie" in honor of the filling's amazing texture.

This pie is always a hit at family gatherings and celebrations. Smooth, rich, and chocolaty; and so easy to make. Just be sure to beat at least 2 minutes between each "egg".

Ohhhhh my, this recipe is quiet easy, but if you only have one store in your town an the nearest Walmart is about 40 mins away don't bother with pasteurized eggs, egg beaters or regular eggs work just fine. I also used bakers chocolate not Hershey and it came out just fine. Defiantly making this during the holidays again!

SUPER DUPER GOOD! And not too rich.  Took the advice of other reviewers and only used 3/4 cup sugar.  Everything else was exact.  Beat it with my Kitchenaid and it turned out fantastic.  I was worried the sugar wasn't going to mix in and it would be grainy, but after the 3rd egg, it was good.  I used organic evaporated cane sugar, and sometimes that seems coarser than white sugar.  Also used Ghiradelli chocolate.  I made this for my chocaholic 4 year old's bday and she dug in and looked like she was in heaven!  Will def make again.

This was perfect - creamy chocolate and whipped cream deliciousness! I used a graham cracker pie crust, and it was amazing. I've made this recipe a couple of times, and the last time I used Earth Balance Buttery Spread instead of butter (wasn't trying to make a statement, I was just out of butter), and I wouldn't recommend it. Made it too salty or something. Light butter seems to work out well, though.

Needed another chocolate square for a richer taste. Good otherwise. can substitute cool whip for topping.  Made WAY too much for a 9" pie. Had nearly enough filling for a whole second one!

It didn't quite turn out like the picture - light in colour and fluffy, but it tasted alright.  I doubled the chocolate but it was still too mild in flavour.  I neglected to lessen the sugar and it was so sweet that I had to add extra whipped cream to make it edible - kinda hurt my teeth!  Definitely do 1/2 cup of sugar.  The recipe also makes 1.5 pie shells worth so I will either do less next time or do some tarts too.  I would 4x the chocolate and half the sugar and see how that goes.

Make with egg beaters!  It turns out great!  Also, my husband added a couple of extra cocoa cubes to make it more chocolatety and that was a good decision!

I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site, rather than packaged, and it complimented the filling well. This filling was very lovely, though I personally would like more vanilla (and I do use a potent one).

This pie rawks. I followed the recipe exactly, except I made a my own crust (but then anything tastes great in one of my world rocking crusts). I also used non pasteurized eggs, and was a little nervous, but we all lived to tell about it. My wife now thinks I'm a Jedi Master in the kitchen also. I hope she never finds out how easy this recipe is. 
Thanks for a great recipe.

This tasted great and was very authentic except for the color.  It wasn't as dark brown as I was expecting (as is normal), nor as dark as the picture.
My husband loved it!
