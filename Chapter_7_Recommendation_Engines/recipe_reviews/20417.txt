Used it in Australia for a Thanksgiving dinner and worked just great, topped with some fresh mint and apple mint leaves in the glass worked a treat

I used half apple juice and half cranberry as I could find a cranberry apple blend. The punch was a little tart/bitter. I would have liked a little more sweetness. Next time I would up the apple juice content to see if that helps.

I make this every year around Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. We all love it. The trick is to mix all of the ingredients together in a beverage dispenser and let sit for at least 6 hours. Enjoy!

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. Iâ€™ll definitely make this again, and I think many of the others at dinner will too. It is something special and festive for those looking for a non-alcoholic drink.

I made this over the holidays and everyone LOVED it!  We drank every last drop.  Making this at Christmas time will definitely be a new family tradition.

This stuff is so good! We've been hooked on it for a while now. Makes a great festive drink for those who can't have alcohol. We eyeball the proportions now, make it with or without the mint, and it's still great. Really refreshing.
