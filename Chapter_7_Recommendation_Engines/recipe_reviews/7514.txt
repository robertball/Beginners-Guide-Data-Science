I made half a batch to try this one out. Everything cooked very well, the consistency was good, it was pretty easy to make. All good points. I'm giving it 4 stars for those facts. 

We did NOT like it for only one fact: It was mega- hugely- super- SWEET! Just way too much for us. I guess we should have figured that out in the beginning considering the full batch uses 6 CUPS OF SUGAR! Wowee! Other people may love super-sweet things, but we don't. I'm not going to take off points for personal preference, as that's not fair. But I don't think we'll make it again.

It was super quick. I was craving something chocolate and this fixed it. I quartered the recipe and it cooked in 5 minutes. I topped it with chocolate syrup instead of making the frosting. I cooked it in a ramekin and it came ou perfectly. I'm going to try some new variations.

I finally tried this recipe, and the reviews were so right! This cake is so simple to make and it turned out very dense and rich like a brownie. It was almost too chocolately for my tastes but everyone else loved it!! Since it only takes 15 minutes to cook and in the microwave at that, I'm sure I'll be making this on a more regular basis when a quick dessert is necessary.

I tried making this recipe in the oven AND in a muffin pan. I wanted little Mississippi cupcakes, it turned out great. I baked it at 375 degrees farenheit (or Gas Mark 4) for 18 minutes. I also incorporated the mini marshmallows in to the better, I had multicoloured ones and they rose to the top to create a very pretty effect.

This was awesome.  My microwave is small so I used a 8 x 8 pyrex pan.  Be sure not to overbake or the edges will be hard as a rock.  The middle can be a bit gooey.  I thought frosting would be overkill, so instead I sprinkled the still warm cake with the mini marshmallows and some chocolate chips.  This was amazing spooned into a dessert bowl and served with vanilla ice cream or cool whip.  When serving after it has cooled, nuke it a bit first as it is best warm.

This was so far from a cake it was pitiful.  Several people asked what kind of brownie mix I used!  If you want "chewy" fine.  If you want a cake keep looking.

This recipe actually turned out great! I was checking out recipes that I can make with my daughter's kindergarten class. I made this by cutting the recipe in half. I sprayed a glass bowl (white Pier One luminous porcelain, a medium size serving dish size) with baking spray. I baked in my microwave for 5 minutes and it was perfectly fluffy and done! I put the new stackable shaped marshmallows on top with some milk chocolate chips and microwaved for 30 seconds or so until slightly melted. I topped with walnuts, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I skipped the frosting. Awesome and this recipe will work for the classroom.

Wow this is fudgy tasting, which I love!  I didn't use the frosting, since this cake is so rich and chocolatey on its own.  I cooked mine for about 8 1/2 mins, and it was perfectly done without getting hard and chewy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a quick, tasty treat! I loved the consistency; just like a chewy brownie. I didn't have marshmallows but it was still delicious. I made a smaller serving than the original recipe. The texture was not at all like typical desserts when baked in a microwave.  I recommend serving it fresh for consumption as soon as it cools! The leftover portion did get harder, i may have cooked it too long.

Very much to my surprize this was great. Kids loved it and definately something I will make again. I did not use as much sugar as it called for cut back to 1 3/4 cup. Did not use the frosting but instead made a simple ganache but poured just a little over vanilla ice cream that we put on top. Definately more like warm brownie goodness than cake and making my mouth water again just thinking about it ;)

This was really good but based on other reviews and being a bit short of time I left out the marshmallows and frosting and just topped with vanilla ice cream. I made 1/2 batch and baked it in a PC 8" stone. I left it in for 9 minutes. I think I maybe could've taken it out earlier but am unfamiliar with baking cakes in the microwave. We ate it while warm and the edges got a little firm, hard to cut through with a spoon/fork but when taking a bite that edge actually had the texture of a crisp cookie. All in all really good. It was still a bit on the sweet side but its a little hard to complain about warm chocolate cake!

Wow! I've been experimenting with microwave cake recipes for a while now, and this one is by far the best I've tried. I did add some baking powder, so I can't say how the "original" recipe is, but with about 1/2 tsp baking powder, it was amazing.

I've also made it with peppermint extract, which I loved. I don't like things too sweet, so I cut the sugar to half and didn't frost it. It was perfect for me. Also, quartering this recipe works really well. 
Update: My favorite version of this cake is more "brownie-style" - which means I cut the eggs in half (but still throw in a pinch of baking powder.) I also love this cake as a peanut butter brownie/cake. Substitute half the butter for peanut butter. (I don't add extra flour to make up for the cocoa and it hasn't been a problem.)

I'm a HUGE brownie fan. This cake definately has the density of a brownie but doesn't come close to tasting as good as a one. It's very chocolatey but I'm not a fan of the taste. It's really easy to make though! Good luck!

I have never had Mississippi Mud Cake, but I was looking for a microwave chocolate cake and this came up.  It looked good, so I tried to make it.  I followed the directions, but what I made did not look like the picture at all.  The cake was more like a brownie and did not rise at all.  The flavor was a bit too buttery, but it was alright.

The frosting was not dark at all, like the photo.  It was too thin and ran right off of the cake.  

My sons ate it, and I would make it again as a quick brownie but I think I'd try less butter, for sure, and pre-made frosting.  It was so rich, I didn't even finish one slice, which was 1/8 of the cake.

I was expecting a cake.

I found my self to be craving chocolate late last night so i found this recipe and decided to make it right away. I let my son try it today and in the words of my 8 year old "i give this recipe infinity stars because it was so so yummy!!". I must admit i totally concur. I did omit the nuts and marshmallows because i did not have any. And i put it into a square pyrex dish. It only took 14 minutes to cook. I found it DEVILISHLY rich so i did not add the frosting. This is a very easy brownie cake (because that is what it is). This is going to be a super Keeper. I love the thought of having it cooking while we are eating dinner so it will be all warm and perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was very good, the only thing was that I used whole wheat flour instead and it was great,  very yummy!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I did as another reviewer stated and only did half of the frosting required which I think was more than enough but it came out very runny.  Not sure what I did wrong  it was still nice and yummy and my hubby agreed!  I will keep doing it again and it was great to have without turning on the oven.  Thanks for sharing!

My mom has made this for years, although now she cooks the oven version. A few tips: Watch your microwave carefully! The one mom always used was large enough for the pan to rotate on its own. My microwave isn't, and turning it while cooking is essential! Remember every microwave is different, so adjust cook times as necessary. DO NOT REFRIGERATE THIS CAKE!!! I can't stress that enough, best tip mom ever gave me. If you do, you'll have a nice big rock!

I loved this recipe! My daughter can't have gluten, so I substituted the flour for 1 2/3 C of the gluten free mix that I use. It worked out very well! Also, instead of the icing I melted about 1 C of chocolate chips and added a tablespoon of margerine (and a bit of milk to help the consistency). Drizzled that over the marshmallow layer. Excellent!

Did everything as instructed except made half a recipe. I don't know what went wrong but wasn't sure if I should microwave as long as stated, but did even though the pan was also smaller. It was so dry, even at the power that was suggested so the problem must have been the time. I debated trying again using less time but decided it wasn't what I really thought it would be by the pictures shown.

I was skeptical of microwaved cake, but this turned out SO GOOD. I cut the recipe in half and used a 6 cup glass storage container. I cooked on medium for 5 minutes then on high for about 2.5 minutes and the cake came out PERFECT - no hard edges, just moist goodness. I made the frosting as is, except cut in half. I thought the sweetness of the frosting was perfect paired with the cake, but be warned it is VERY sweet so if you aren't into super duper sweetness, cut down the confectioners sugar a bit. Give this recipe a try!!! It's so good!

Very tasty and quick to make!  No frosting needed.  We made a half recipe in a pyrex pie plate for 5 minutes.  It was perfectly soft and moist.  We made while waiting for our new oven to arrive, but plan to make it even when we have our oven back.  Yum!

Wow, this certainly is a great way to use your microwave! To us, this was more of a hard bar than a soft brownie, but still very good (especially warm). The icing is excellent and when it melts over the bars, ummmm.... We had this with vanilla ice cream for a perfect Father's Day dessert. We all think that this should be renamed "Rocky Road Bars," because that is the exact flavor. Enjoy!

This is very good, but too sweet for our tastes. I think it would be better with just a half batch of frosting. There is almost as much frosting as cake when the recipe is made exactly.

My oven was disconeccted when my husband was doing some const. on my floor and I wanted to bake something so bad but I only had use of the microwave. I found this recipe and was so pleased with the results. It is the best when very fresh. Thanks
