I made these last weekend, as part of a dessert donation to a local shelter. I used chocolate graham crackers for the base as I had that on hand, but otherwise adhered to the recipe. Then I piped buttercream onto each of the brownies. I was very pleased with the recipe--in particular,  I found the chocolate taste to be pleasantly intense but not overly sweet. The ratio of cocoa powder to sugar was perfect. Brownies were nice and crunchy on the bottom and chewy on the inside. I will be making these again.

I made these with pecans instead of walnuts baked them in mini muffin tins (which took 12-14 minutes) and topped them with caramel icing. They were a huge hit and I will definitely be making them again.

My son wanted brownies for his birthday instead of cake so I thought I would give these a try. I used chocolate graham crackers and chocolate frosting. These brownies are very dense and rich. When I make them again I will stick to the animal crackers for the crust and try making them in a mini muffin pan because one brownie cup is too much for young children but otherwise a good recipe!

I made these for a friend who was sick. I wasn't sure about the crust at the bottom at first but was pleasantly surprised. They turned out great and I would definitely make them again!

I volunteered to make brownies for a teacher appreciation luncheon and discovered the night before that I didn't have as much brownie mix as I thought:-/ A quick search turned these up. They won because they used ingredients that I had on hand and seem portable. I'm glad for the decision! I omitted the nuts and added a few chocolate chips to the top of each. They're adorable and delicious (I uh tried one out for quality assurance reasons:) ).

A review means you tried the recipe and you are commenting on whether you think it was good or bad. This is helpful to others who may be considering trying it. Don't give a recipe a poor rating because you think it calls for too much sugar and is unhealthy. If you are looking for a healthy brownie recipe Google one. These were Scrumptious!!

We love brownies and my family thought these were among the best! The crust seems crumbly at first but after they're cooked everything holds together perfectly. Omitted the nuts and made them in mini muffin tins baked for about 12 minutes. Thank you!

It is pretty good. I was using cake pop maker so I added a bit of baking powder and put a piece of chocolate chip in the middle. I think it will taste ok with whipped cream or ice cream...

Phenomenal chocolate flavor - just the right amount of sweetness. (Note to self - done at 22)

I think it was really good. I prefer it without crackers.
