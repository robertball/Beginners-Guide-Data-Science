I prepared this exactly as the recipes stated. If you are looking for a nice grilled chicken recipes, this will suffice. However, it did NOT taste like tandoori chicken. The flaor of the spices was not prominent enough, nor was it hot enough.

These were good but agree not a true tandoori flavor.  I ended up grilling mine and they were very tender
