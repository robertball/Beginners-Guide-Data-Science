So yummy!  I made a half batch and put it in my crockpot to simmer all day long.  The only changes (other than halving all the ingredients) I made were the following: I left out the paprika and the cloves, because I didn't have any on hand.  I used 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon in place of the cinnamon sticks, and I put in much less oregano than the recipe required...I'm not a huge fan of oregano.  The really great thing about this recipe is that it is so versatile.  You can control the heat by which chile pepper you use (i used poblano and the chili was only mildly spicy), and you can adjust the herbs and spices to your taste.  It's a very forgiving recipe!  The chili turned out wonderful, and the flavor from simmering all day was amazing.  If you use a crockpot to make this recipe, put the beans in only for the last hour of cooking on low heat.  That way they don't soften up too much.

I've made this recipe twice, and I think it's very tasty if you add some more kick to it. 

I like my chili thick and meaty, so I reduced some of the vegetables. I cooked the meat separately and drained off all the fat. I used only 1.5 tablespoons of oil (asking for 5 is crazy), I didn't add the cinammon, I used only two cans of tomatoes, I used only 1 large onion, and only 1.5 cans of kidney beans.

The key to making this recipe great is adding more spice. I put 3 jalapenos, a full tablespoon of chili powder, and 1-2 teaspoons of cayenne powder. I think the cayenne is critical to heating it up. Fortunately, the recipe is very forgiving, and I would taste it every ten minutes and add more cayenne until it reached the level of heat I liked.

A great chili recipe!  We tried it 2 weeks ago and just made a double batch today.  Yum!  

I did find that it was a bit too cinnamony, so when I doubled the ecipe, I only used 3 cinnamon sticks instead of 4.  That did it.  

Also, to add some more heat I added 2 jalepeno peppers and 1 additional chili pepper in the double batch.  A nice burn, but not screaming hot.  Not so hot that you need a cold glass of water nearby, but a nice smooth heat that you notice.  

A few extra shakes of cumin and chili powder as well as doubling the garlic made this the best chili I have ever tasted!

This is by far one of the best chili recipes I've ever had.  I used nearly all of the tips the other reviews gave.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We made this recipe with ground buffalo meat from our farm. We cooked it for 8 hours in a slow cooker, so we added extra chopped tomato.  Our guests were so impressed!!

I have never eaten, much less cooked chili and today is the first time i made it. I skipped cloves and cinnamon and I halved the recipe since i only have half of the amount of the meat. I improvised on the chillies ( xtra chilli powder and cayenne) and i topped it with red pepper flakes. So mine was extremely spicy and it came out salty and sour-ish. Some family member liked it, others loathe it but i personally loved it :)

Love it, except the cloves get lost in the chili and it's a surprise when you bite down on one.  From now on, I'll use 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves instead.

It was ok, not great, but just ok.  I think the addition of cinnamon and cloves threw it off.  To me that combination was strange.  Maybe I'm not too adventurous with my chile con carne, but I really wanted a good traditional recipe and the spices were just off.

LOVED this recipe, this was the best chili ever! All the different spices and ingredients made the taste very complex. I usually use just the chili mix packet from the store, but this recipe is a real knockout for me! Thank you :)

This recipe was given a real test when I prepared this for my brother-in-law... a True Texan. He loved it and gave me a big compliment by saying "You should move to Texas if you can make Chili like this"!
I did reduce the cinnamon by one stick as suggested and put it in the teaball with the cloves. All the spices blended so perfectly ...so much so that you really couldn't specifically taste any of them individually. I asked my company if they could taste the cinnamon in it and once I mentioned it they said they could but not before.  I also would say that the "heat index" was perfect for this. My husband loves things extra spicy and he did not get up to find something to "add" to it. However he did say that he wouldn't have wanted it any more mild. On the other hand my 82 year old mother felt it was hotter than she would have liked yet she was able to eat it! But for the most part I think this fell into a perfect area to please everyone and people that want it spicier can always add drops of hotsauce.
I also made a vegetarian variation of this in a 1/2 batch while I had all the ingredients out by using Boca's ground beef soy packets....didn't want my 18 year old to feel left out!

Don't be put off by those who hate the cinnamon and clove flavors. If you just open your mind to a new taste sensation, they make this chili really delicious. We added a can of refried beans to this. Otherwise, we followed the recipe and loved the result

I have used the Boilermaker Tailgate chili recipe from Allrecipes for several years, and its amazing.  Over time I have adjusted that recipe to my taste. I thought I would try this one and it didn't disappoint.  Great recipe!  

Since I had them on hand, I used dried California Chili pods.  I just roasted them with a tablespoon of oil and threw them in  my food processor then to the crockpot with the other ingredients.  Omitted the fresh chili pepper in lieu of the dried pods.  

Added a cup of pilsner, an extra onion, and an extra pound of ground beef but outside of that stuck to the original recipe.  Darn good chili.  

Now whether its better than the Boilermaker Tailgate chili recipe, I will leave that up to individual opinions.  Both are awesome.

I made this last evening and it was great. I used 1/4 tsp chili powder instead of chili pepper, and ground cloves instead whole cloves, and it still tasted great. Kids love it.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My husband said it was the best chili he had ever tasted! I did not have cinnamon sticks so used ground and only about 3 tablespoons of oil. I also used canned diced tomatoes (mexican style). I will add more beans next time and cook them myself.  This really is a fantastic recipe!

I tried this today.  I think it's great.  But next time I will do away with the cloves because it over powers the taste of the other spices.  I added cayenne and a more cumin for that extra strong, hot and spicy taste.

This is by far the best chili my family and I have enjoyed.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the cinnamon sticks.  My wife doesn't like cinnamon so I substituted them 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder instead.  This is now our family's official chili recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  The cinnamon really added a twist.  The only thing I did differently was drained most of the grease after browning the meat (with the oil, onions, garlic and peppers), and then added the rest of the ingredients.  But overall it was easy to prepare, and did freeze well.

I made this last time as I wanted to try a different con carne recipe than my usual.  It was ok but the strong smell of cloves and cinnamon was enough for both my husband and I to never want to eat this again. The smell ruins it. I have nothing against cinnamon or cloves but when paired with chili it's just weird... in my opinion.

I served this to my extended family.  We all discussed the rating.  We would eat it again if it was served to us, however we wouldn't cook it this way again.  The one thing we did like was the consistency.

I made chill last night, and it was a hit. My husband loved it, because it wasn’t spicy. I did change the recipe a little; I used black and pinto beans, instead of the red kidney beans. I also left out the chili pepper and cinnamon sticks.

I think I put the kidney beans in to early and it kind of got a burnt taste on it.  Before I did that it tasted yummy - will try again and hold off with the kidney beans

This deserves a zero rating but that isn't an option on this page.  I can't believe you would advise cinnamon in chili this was the most DISGUSTING chili we have ever tasted.  We thought my husband made a mistake and put cinnamon instead of chili powder and so did all of our guests, someone even said what is this dessert chili.  Cinnamon does not belong in chili.

Yum! I am done looking for chili recipes!  My entire family loved it. The level of spiciness was kid friendly, but still enough to be very tasty. The cloves really added a nice grown up flavor. I used chili beans instead of kidney beans. I also poured in about 1/3 c. strong black coffee - an impulse decision - gave it a bit of a smoky, dark flavor. I can see where this would be an excellent recipe to experiment with. I will definitely will be sharing this recipe!  Thanks!

I changed the number of servings for 5 & was shocked at the amount of seasoning used! As it was, it was way too chilli hot but then again I did use hot chilli powder instead of regular(!) So then I ended up doubling the amount of diced tomatos which certainly helped. I didn't have any cinnamon sticks, so just chucked a heap of powder in & it still tasted good. Overall this delivered quite a good spicy result - I had it with baked potatos & sour cream and the taste was heavenly! This recipe is a keeper.

terrific chili. I added 1 green pepper in with the onions and garlic. Used 1 can pinto beans and 1 can kidney instead of 2 cans kidney . . . adds different color and texture. Only used 1 cinnamon stick, and put that and the cloves in a tea ball like another reader suggested. I might add more chili pepper next time for some more kick. This is a keeper! Thanks!

Wonderful! Tastes just like the chili served at community chili dinners when I was a child in south Texas. My Yankee husband thought it was nuts that we served chili over rice; now he loves it! I added jalapenos and used ground cloves in place of whole cloves. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Delicious! I used the beans, omitted cinnamon and used cayenne pepper. Served over rice with shredded head lettuce. I think I will give cinnamon a try next time when I cook only for our family. Didn't want to risk as I was cooking for more that 10 people.

I had everything except the chile pepper and I had to doctor it up as it was very bland.  I added more chili powder and still I was disappointed,  HOWEVER once my husband and I added alittle cheese, salsa and sour creme in our bowls MAN was it ever delicious! We were surprised how good it tasted! I will definitely be making this again.

I love chili and am always up to try some.  Like the other reviewers, the cinnamon and cloves were a little worrisome.  I added them, but probably 1/2 of the recommended amount.  I think they key is to give it time to cook through with the rest of the spices.  The combination ended up being great.  Good flavor (although not very spicy).  Next time will probably add a little more of a kick, but worked well, is versatile, and freezes well.

Every bite is cinnamon.  Cinnamon and tomatoes! So I tried to save this chili - because this wasn't cheap to make.  So I threw in some spices - and still the only thing you can taste and smell is CINNAMON.  I spent a good hour trying to get rid of the cinnamon - couldn't get rid of it. CINNAMON was always in every bite.

I was looking for a homemade chili recipe to complete another recipe-Cornbread Topped Chili. I halved the recipe with a few changes to use what I had on hand. Used powdered cinnamon,chopped fresh tomatoes (6 small) and a can of tomatoes with green chilis and used one fresh jalepeno pepper. Then I used two boxes of corn bread mix and poured the batter over the chili and cooked for 25 minutes until golden brown.It came out great.This was cooked in an oven-proof skillet. The cinnamon seemed to compliment the sweetness of the cornbread which was a nice contrast to the spice.

This recipe truly is the best I have ever made.  I haven't changed a thing and sometimes make it in my slow cooker.  It is even better the next day.  As well, I always make a large pot of this for the freezer.

Excellent recipe. This one's a keeper.  I disagree that the cinnamon needs to be reduced.  I made this recipe for my husband and son (both of whom are pretty tough when it comes to chili they like).  They both did not mind the cinnamon.  What I did, however, was put in a fresh red hot pepper from my garden (Sorry I don't know what kind, but, trust me, it was pretty hot.)  The hot pepper overpowered the cinnamon taste and made it just right!  We all like picante, so the degree of heat was right for us.  I did break up both cinnamon sticks and put them with the whole cloves in a tea ball before adding them to the pot. The only other change I made was with the tomatoes.  I used one 28-oz can of whole tomatoes and two fresh tomatoes (cut up into large chunks).  I served the chili on hot rice.  It was great!

Very good.  However, I did not use ground beef.  I wanted more "body" and decided to cube my beef (1/4 inch cubes,very small).  It gave the chili great texture.  I had no whole cloves and used a "pinch" of ground instead.  I also added a small can of tomato paste to thicken.  Turned out great!

This is the best chili recipe ever I've made it over and over! I live too far north to get fresh chili pepper and so I use a dash or two of red pepper flakes.  Also, I added 2-3 chopped roasted red peppers out of the jar (really adds to the flavor in my opinion).  After reading the other reviews I too only put one cinnamon stick in this chili. Thanks a bunch!

Don't need all the other spices. Cumin and Chilli Powder is important! 

For my serving (4 pax) would be better with 1.5 cans of tomato and cook only for 45mins no more. 

Fantastic served with rice!

This was very good. I am not a huge chili lover but  I did enjoy this recipe very much, and my partner who loves chili, thought it was the best he'd tasted. I had run out of regular paprika so used smoked parika instead, which added an interesting dimension. I might use it again in this recipe, but reduce the amount slightly as the smokey flavour is quite strong.

i just tried this today and i must say this is really good. i've been craving for chili for a week now and this definitely hits the spot. the heat is just right too. i followed everything in the recipe (scaled down to 3 servings).before eating, i topped it with some cheese and tortilla chips and i think it's great!   the only problem i had was since i couldn't find canned red kidney beans i used the raw ones. i soaked it for an hour but i didn't know that you were supposed to cook it first before using. i kinda thought since i soaked it already it would cook fine when i add them to the chili. so i ended up with semi raw beans. but since a lot of the reviews said this was better when served the next day, i just microwaved it the next day and the beans turned out ok. maybe another re-heating would make the beans the perfect soggy texture that i want. but overall, this recipe is great in itself.   just a question though, what is that white sauce in the picture? cheese sauce?

Very good. Tastes extremely basic, but in a good way. Great for people who don't like to or don't know how to cook since it's hard to mess up. I cooked this in a crock pot for 4 hours on high and came out great.

This was my first venture into making chili and it came out very well! I was light handed with the paprika because i figured I could always add more. The cinnamon really adds a special flavor to it. I did halve the cloves because my bf hates them :) We made a TON and we are looking forward to freezing and reheating it for the next few weeks.

My husband and I loved this chili. The cloves and cinnamon make this recipe and should not be left out. I used smoked paprika, and two fresh jalapeno peppers and a spicy chili powder, and cut back the oil by 2T; it turned out nice and spicy.

This is a great chili recipe. I've found that it's a bit better if I use stew beef instead of ground beef, add in some black beans, and crush up some tortilla chips and add them in.

My husband, whom hates beans, loves this chili!  I use ground turkey instead of beef and add in whatever vegetables I have on hand (bell peppers, mushrooms, etc).  Once used double the chili powder in place of cumin, and it was just as good.

I loved this chili!  It was very easy to make and even better the next day!  Like others I added only one cinnamon stick and added a bottle of stout beer instead of one of the cans of tomatoes.  Next time I will add the full tomato amount with a half bottle of beer.

This was a GREAT chili recipe, probably the best I've had.  So many layers of flavor.  I guess the clove gave it a good punch (I didn't use cinammon).  I wish, however, that I had been able to get the clove out before serving.  My picky hubby munched down on one and it scandalized him.  Anyway, it was a perfect blend of spice and flavors and I will be making it again.

This has been my first chili making experience - I just finished a batch and it's DELICIOUS!  

I also followed the advice of others (draining the beef mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients, using one cinnamon stick and placing cloves in tea bag ball) All other ingredients & measurements remained unchanged.

I am serving it tonight with tortilla chips for my husband and elbow macaroni for my kids.

THANKS SO MUCH!

This was easy and my family LOVED it! My Mom said it was the best chili she ever had. She rates it a 7 star. I added a little extra chili powder to make it spicier and I left out the cloves only because I couldn't find them in the grocery store.  Serve with grated cheese, scallions and tortilla chips!

Thanks Fay!  This has an awesome taste.  I'm a carnivore and love spicy food.  My wife is the opposite but we both loved this dish.  I heeded the advice of other and only used 1 cinnamon stick, which was just right.  I also drained the beef after browning, and picked out the cloves before serving since they have a weird texture.  We will definitely make again!

A VERY tasty chili!  It was a hit with the whole family!...(and that doesn't happen too often!)
Next time I make it though, I will leave out the cinnamon sticks.  They didn't seem to fit with the chili.  I would also cut back on the garlic.  I found the garlic taste a little overpowering.
I thought it might be way too spicy with the chili pepper in it, but it turned out just right.
A definate must to make again!
Thanks Fay!

I couldn't imagine adding cinnamon to this recipe but I decided to give it a try, since we all love cinammon.  None of my family liked it and neither did I.  I only added half the cinnamon and increased the amount of chilies to give it a bit of bite.  We found the cinnamon gave the chili a sweet taste which was rather odd and not to our liking. I will make this chili again, BUT without the cinnamon. For us this would probably have been a five star  if i would have omitted this spice.

Great recipe!  I added a sprinkle of cloves even though I hate them and part of me wished I had left them out, but I'll be a trooper.  I like a good tomato sauce as my base, so I added a can of tomato sauce.  After browning meat and adding ingredients, I placed the pasta sauce into a crockpot and added the rest of the ingredients and let it all cook together for 90 minutes.  I used just one cinnamon stick instead of two (sheesh, they are expensive) The cloves overpowered the aroma but it didn't kill the flavor, thank goodness.  Other than the cloves, it was great.  (They were quite expensive too and I don't even like those nasty things.)  Would be 5 stars without the cloves. 

Also, I added a small can of pinto beans with the kidney beans for a little variety.

This is a great chili recipe that I will definitely be making again.  Like some reviewers suggested, I used only one cinnamon stick but I hardly tasted the cinnamon flavor so two would have probably been ok as well.  I used Mexican spices and a poblano chili which I think is important for overall flavor.  The only issue I had was my own fault.  I used ground chuck and didn’t drain the fat well enough.

Excellent idea to add clove and cinnamon.  I made following modifications:
---added whole cumin to oil before sauteing onions instead of powder.
---used minimum oil like some other reviewers
---used canned crushed tomatoes instead of crushing my own. added 1/3 can paste (left over from something else) for six servings, perhaps a can for the full recipe.
---used whole round (from sale) sliced to

made this in a crockpot (browned the beef first).  i added the 5 Tbsp oil, but not sure if that was necessary in a crockpot.  also, took the cinnamon sticks out after about 45 minutes.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I added a whole lot more chili powder and paprika, as I thought it wasn't spicy enough, but that's just my taste. I'll definitely be making it again.

Really enjoyed this chili, was very good. I did however add a teaspoon of sugar and i didn't add as much oil. That was way to much for my taste.

This is wonderful!  I never made chili before and this definetly gave me that homemade chili satisfaction I was craving.  I cut the recipe in half (just my husband and I) and added two peppers for some nice heat!  A personal preference.

Great with a few modifications that I thought would be helpful. DID NOT use cinnamon or cloves...didn't like the sound of that but used this recipe as a starting point.   I did 2lbs ground beef, one onion, one green pepper, 4 cloves garlic, 1 can red kidney beans, 1 can whole tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, paprika, s&p to taste but also added a few red pepper flakes and 1 can tomato paste to thicken. It was awesome - even better the second day.

Great starter.  Not enough heat for me, but that is easy with adding more peppers and spices. Great tasting...

I made this recipe as printed. It sounded like it would be a good recipe with a twist.  Cinnamon made it gross, lack of flavor besides the cinnamon. Now I have to figure out how to save this meal so I don't throw it away. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RECIPE!

I love this chili! I wasn't sure about the cinnamon, and too much can overpower, but I found 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon to be just enough to add a unique flavour and not to have the tastebuds scream out "Hey, there's cinnamon in here!"  I haven't tried adding the cloves yet, but may need to enliven the palate and live dangerously...! I've substituted the chile pepper for 1-2tsp. cayenne and it works out well. This is my kind of recipe--simple, a little different and fabulous!

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  He wasn't so sure about the cloves and cinnamon.  I had to add a little spice to balance out the clove taste and then her raved about it.  

So if you think the cloves and cinnamon are too much I suggest spicing it up since chili powder really varies in heat it is impossible to say this recipe isn't spicy enough or flavorful enough--it is your chili powder.

This is an easy-anytime recipe - I just love it!!! 

Personally I do not like the cinnamon and cloves taste, so I usually do not add them to this recipe and it still tastes amazing.

To make this recipe into my personal taste, I add some green bell peppers finely chopped and some parsley as well; to give an extra spicy flavor, I do not rinse the beans (in cayenne and cumin sauce). And finally I always prefer to use fresh ingredients than the dried ones.

Super yum! I just made this and my husband won't stop trying to sneak more before the Super Bowl.  I used one can of kidney beans and one can of chickpeas.  I also switched the measurements of chili powder and paprika, making the chili have more chili powder.  I also used only 1 stick of cinnamon, reducing as per other users' suggestions and no cloves since I had none on hand.  For the three cans of tomatoes, two had jalapenos and one mild chiles.  Overall, the consistency and appearance are to die for and will make any chili lover drooling waiting to get some.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Very good recipe!  Go easy on the cloves, though..The first time I made it I used ground instead of whole and it overpowered the chili a bit.  A fraction of a pinch will do!  I also found that the cinnamon sticks should only sit in the chili for a little while as that can overpower it as well.  I make this chili whenever we entertain which is quite a bit and it's always the first to go!

haven't changed a thing in the recipe, it was very delicious that fact that i made it several times with the variation of the side dishes. once we had it with rice and other times we had it with tortialls and the other time i used it as to topping on the burgers that was a bomb.

I gave it a 4 because it wasn't very spicy like Chili should be and real chili doesn't have beans so I left those out.  I used 3 Tablespoons of Chili Powder, added 1 teaspoon of cayenne and 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  My wife couldn't stand the chili because of the cinnamon sticks.  I have to admit it did make it taste strange.  I think I will leave it out next time but all in all the chili was pretty good.

Great recipe! I did not use the chile pepper and instead of the whole tomatoes I used 1-28oz can of crushed tomatoes because that was all I had, and I put in half the amount of cinammon.  It turned out wonderful.

This was really good - dont let the cinammon stick fool you. Good flavor but I gave it 4 stars cuz I thought it had no heat at all - next time I'll add some extra cayanne or something. Real good though - thanks!

This recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC! I made this tonight for myself and some friends. I changed it up a bit by adding about a  teaspoon of crushed red pepper and an additional teaspoon of chili powder. Also, I could not find a chili pepper, so I used about 8 chopped Fresno Peppers. All in all, I think I came up with the same effect. This is a HIGHLY recommended recipe!! All the guys at your table will enjoy!

I have finally found the perfect chili recipe after years of searching.  I used two red finger chile peppers for the chili pepper and it was the perfect amount of spice, but very smooth.  I put the cloves and cinnamon sticks in a tea ball so they didn't stay in the chili and for easy removal.  The flavor of this is very mellow, spicey and hearty but not too rich.  Amazing!!!

My husband really liked this which is saying something because he is not a fan of ground beef.  I think two large onions gave this a nice texture.  I had to do some substitutions like using the powdered versions of cinnamon and cloves.  Also came up short on chili powder so I put in some cayenne also.  Next time I will make sure to have all the chili powder needed on hand. Used a couple drops of our favorite red chili sauce as well.  Made this with one can of tomato paste, one can of tomato sauce, and one can of stewed tomatoes.  Also added one can of sliced mushrooms.  Excellent over linguine.  We'll be having this regularly!

Mmmmmm......Yummy....Absolutelly delicious. I followed it to the letter, except I added a bit of crushed chillies to make it spicier. I served it over saffron rice (amazing color contrast), sprinkled some cilandro on top and some sour cream. Excellent. It was eaten to the last drop and its very economic if making a huge party. I also used the naan recipe from this site to make tortilla like breads (i rolled it thinner and circular). I will definitelly be making this again.

I am not a fan of chili, but my hubby wanted to make some with venison (which I not too fond of either!) so I chose this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!!!  The best chili I have ever had.  I am now a fan of it!  I did add a green pepper and a hot banana pepper..very good!  We couldn't get enough of it.  Thank you for a recipe that I will continue to use...and now I will enjoy the deer as much as my husband!

Great hearty chili recipe! The ingredients are perfect. I made this recipe in a slow cooker and did the following to adapt to this recipe: 

1. Brown the meat on medium high heat without oil (85% lean to 15% fat ground meat).
2. Pour and dispose most of the grease out of the pan.
3. There should be enough grease on the pan to cook the onions, garlic and jalepenos and cook on medium heat. Cook till you can smell the flavors and the onions look shiny (do not put the ventilator on, smell your food)
4. Put all the ingredients listed in this recipe (except the canned kidney beans) into the slow cooker and set on low. I also didn't add any more oil as I felt there was enough from the beef fat. Add a can of tomato paste into the pot.
5. cook on low 4-6 hours. Add kidney beans and cook without the lid if for a thick chili.
6. enjoy.

I've made a lot of chili over the years, but didn't have my recipe handy.  So I found this one on allrecipes because generally the site and its' users do a great job.  Unfortunately this recipe was a big disappointment.  I reduced the amount of cinnamon a bit, since I really didn't want to taste it explicitly.  I also reduced the oregano a little because I've had it over-power dishes in the past.  I left the full amount of cumin in there, which was a big mistake.  The cumin became the predominant flavor.  Both my wife and I felt it really didn't taste like chili at all.  It wasn't bad, just not chili.  If you put enough fixings on it (sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc) then it tastes better, but there's better recipes.  My past recipes called for more chili powder and never had cumin in them.  I would consider adding cumin in the future, but a far less amount.

Superb.  Made 1.5 batch, and used 1 habañero and 1 jalapeño  - that way you get some heat in the front and some more at the back.  The cinnamon and cloves really give it a nice savory punch.

Absolutely love this recipe! I omitted the cinnamon sticks, used canned garlic chopped tomatoes in place of the garlic & whole tomatoes, added habanero peppers and one tablespoon of cayenne pepper. Very spicy but just the way I like it!

I liked it a lot, but my son thought it was too spicy. I did wonder if all that oregano was necessary. Also, I drained several tablespoons of fat off after browning the meat; wondered why the recipe didn't suggest this.

Delicious!  Left out cloves because I didn't know if they would dissolve in the chili and it seemed like they could be too hard on your teeth if you bit down on them.  Any feedback on this? Used two jalapeños for peppers.  I am going to bundle up the herbs for gifts and /or bake sale fundraisers.  A great simple and classic chili.  A new staple in my house.

Ohhh...It's just my love! I used ground lamb and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I omitted cinnamon, whole cloves and cloves garlic. Used a mix of cumin, chili, oregano, garlic powder and salt. I used also 1 sweet pepper and 5 minutes before switching off the cooker I added 15 g of dark 70% chocolate. Mexico!!!

Very good recipe.   This is very similar to the chili I have made for years.   I made some small additions.   I added one chopped green pepper, one stalk of celery chopped and a can of brown beans (I like Clarks Beans with Molasses) but any will do.   I also recommend adding one square of dark chocolate (Lindt with Chili pepper is best) but any dark chocolate will do.   It really enhances the chili.

I'm not a cook by any means, and this is the first recipe I've followed.  Made it the first few times with ground beef.  Very tasty but a little heavy for my taste, probably because as I was learning I used more beef than called for.  But it is very, very good, and I especially like the use of cloves and cinnamon, which I had not thought as an ingredient in a chili dish.  But what do I know, right?  Well, I decided to use ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it's fantastic.  Lighter but fully satisfying, and my whole place smells fantastic as it cooks.  I've refrigerated leftovers in individual size plastic microwaveable containers, which allows me to add a little rice for a quick lunch or dinner meal.  And it's relatively simple to prepare, which for me was a great attraction.  Enjoy.

I made this in the crockpot and let it cook on low for about 6 hours. I only used 2 cans of tomatoes and cut the oregano down to 1T. I added the kidney beans in the last hour so they wouldn't get too mushy. Definitely a family pleaser. Thankyou BUBBLE.

"googled" for "best chile recipe" and came up with this one. Cooked double batch of it for 18 folks last night; everybody raved and about half wanted the recipe. Altered it slightly by adding an extra pound of beef, 3 tbs of ground cinnamon in addition to sticks, 1 additional tblsp each of salt, pepper & chili powder. This is NOW my chili recipe!!!

I don't make chili that often, but I will now. This really is a robust and  delicious chili recipe with a very nice consistency (I love a thicker chili). I did omit the cloves and used less cinnamon. I used a jalapeno and it  rednered what I would call a very mild chili, all good because I have kids. It's delicious regardless but if you like some heat to your chili, you may want to add an extra chili pepper or perhaps add it closer to the end of cooking time. This will be the chili recipe for my family. Thanks.

This is a nice, mild recipe for chili. I added some corn and two jalapenos for the chilis. My only complaint is that the cinnamon flavor is very strong. Next time I will only use one stick of cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!

This was made to use on hot dogs & it worked well because it was thick and not very spicy.  Next time (for use on hotdogs) I will omit the beans.

I was a little iffy on using the cinnamon in this recipe, but decided I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did!  I served it with cornbread and a good dollop of sour cream and it was perfect.

The taste of this chili was really good but it was a tad dry for our tastes so before leaving it to simmer I also added one 14.5 ounce can of tomato sauce. Not too runny not too dry.

This is a keeper... very, very good.  Didn't have cinamon sticks so added just a bit of ground cinnamon (1/4 -1/2 tsp).  Wonderful recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Doubled this recipes for a crowd and everyone loved it.  I used one jalapeño pepper instead of two and used one cinnamon stick instead of 4 and omitted the cloves. The chili still had a nice spicy kick to it. I cooked it for about 7 hours and did add about a cup of tomato sauce to thin it out a bit. Served sour cream, cheddar cheese, red pepper flakes and tortilla chips. Great recipe.

Excellent mild chili recipe.  I tweaked it for ingredients that I had on hand, omitting the chile pepper, cloves, cinnamon and oil (browning the onions and garlic in the ground beef before draining).  I halved the recipe and only had one can of tomatoes so I cut in some fresh tomatoes and added a half teaspoon of sugar to cut down on the acidity.  To compensate for leaving out the chile pepper, I added a full tablespoon of chili powder and a quarter teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Because this chili is mild, I can eat more of it, which makes me happy.  =)

This is a great chili recipe!!  I love all the flavors and the cinnamon is wonderful.  I accidently added Cayenne Pepper and it still turned out great (just a little more spicy-eveyone liked the spiciness though!).  Thanks for sharing!

Very good! It's a bit bland as is, but you can add cayanne or red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

My husband and I both thought this was very good, and he's picky.  We like spice so we added some hot sauce, but that's the only change I made.  Great with corn bread.  I would definitely make it again, but I'm not sure it's THE chili recipe yet.  But thanks for a great dinner last night!

This chili was great!  I threw everything into a crockpot and cooked overnight.  I used 1 28oz can of pureed tomatoes and one bottle of beer, and also reduced cinamon to 1 stick.  Not very spicy, but when I reheated I added some crushed dried hot pepper and some cayenne.

This is an AWESOME recipe! My hubby ate it for two days, said it was the best chili he has ever had! He wants to make it for his firehouse! We don't like alot of kidney beans so I cut it down to 1/2 a can and for those of you with kids~omit the chile pepper~ It still has a kick but not as spicy. Thanks Fay :)

Well despite all the rave reviews, I wasn't as blown away by this one as i had hoped. The only alteration I made was to substitute a can of itanian stewed tomatoes for one of the cans of peeled tomatoes. I just thought it was missing something. I just haven't found a chili recipe that beats the Wick Fowler's Famous 2-Alarm Chili-Kit,(can be made from 1 alarm to 4 alarm) available in the supermarket.

I served this chili over elbow macaroni and shredded cheddar cheese on top. Kids love this recipe, perhaps it's the sweet mellow taste. I also added 3/4 of a cup of brewed coffee. I added hot sauce for myself and husband's portion. Thanks for recipe!

I used a sprinkle of crushed dried chili peppers as I didn't have a whole chili and I thought it would be better to let people add their own later. i also subbed 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a sprinkle of  ground cloves rather than the whole spices. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Even better reheated the second day.

This is a great recipe for chili, and it's become a big family favorite! The only change I made was using 2 tsp of both ground cinnamon and ground cloves in place of the cinnamon stick and whole cloves.

I  took out the oregano, doubled the recipe, added one crushed dried ancho pepper for smokey mild heat, 1/2 tsp of cayenne powder, 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke, 1 cup of beef stock, 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 1.5 cups of bourbon. I also substituted ground cloves and cinnamon for whole cloves and cinnamon sticks. Yeah, it's a new chili with an emphasis on smoke, sweet and heat. It's not bad but requires more tinkering - perhaps less cumin.

Overall this is a decent recipe BUT...the cinnamon/cloves addition is not! If you really want to try those spices then add a tiny amount to a separate bowl of chili. Otherwise, you may end up ruining the entire batch. Fortunately, I only added a dash of each to my entire pot. Had I added their suggested amounts, I would have to have thrown it  away.

I’ve been using this recipe for years. I love it. I am one person now, so I’ve been making this recipe in half erring on the plus side in terms of ingredients. For example, 3 cans of tomatoes in half would be 1 1/2 cans (roughly 22oz) but I put in 1-28oz can (I like having chunks of tomatoes in it). Same with spices. I also omit the cinnamon because I’m simply not a fan of it. And I make this with ground chicken most often now instead of the beef. I tried with turkey also, but the chicken is my (and my family’s) favorite right now. It almost feels lighter. Give it a try, you won’t regret it!

Love the touch of cinnamon.  I omit the cloves, but sometimes add cut up bacon to compliment the ground beef.  I add chopped celery if I have it, and saute that and the onion in the bacon fat, eliminating the oil in the recipe.

This is the best chile con carne recipe I've found!  It has a lovely balance of flavors, and the addition of the cinnamon and clove add just the right touch.  Since we have access to these ingredients so readily, I used fresh beans and tomatoes -- it lengthens the cooking time a bit, but it's worth it.

A good hearty stew. I made this vegetarian by omitting the beef and substituting lentils.

It was lovely albeit way too hot for me. Next time I would leave out the chilli powder and just stick with the whole chile

First of all this recipe should be halved.  I used 1 lb. tube ground beef. Mince garlic on small piece of wax paper(wash hands and avoid eye contact). Use just enough olive oil (not vegetable) to coat frying pan. Throw in minced garlic and start heating until hot enough to start browning beef. After breaking up beef dash with salt and fresh ground pepper all the while dicing 1 green pepper, 1 onion, and 1 stick of celery(not cinnamon, this is chili not apple pie) while continuing to brown beef. Drain Grease. Add a second round of S&P, and your veggies which should equal approx same amount as beef. Simmer til veggies are tender(˜15 min.). Transfer to soup pot adding 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can chili beans, and start adding spices. Forego cinnamon, cloves, paprika, and oregano. Easy on the cumin(not more than 1 tsp.), and the first wave of chili powder and hot sauce(cayenne pepper). I also add about a tsp. of sugar to offset tomato acids. Have a can of tomato sauce ready to thicken or thin to your liking. Remember when it comes to spices you can always add more but you can't remove once they are put in. Continue stirring and tasting over low-medium heat until starting to boil. Overcooking will make your chili mushy with no texture. Serve yourself a bowl with saltines(w/without butter). After having finished your second bowl divide what's left into two containers(1 for fridge other for freezer).

I left out the cloves and used dried chili peppers instead of fresh hot pepper but I added quite a bit more chili powder n- perhaps about 3 1/2 TBSP.  it was not too spicy and I served with a combo of shredded cheeses and everyone loved it!

I will most definitely make this again. No reason to ever buy the store bought mix again. Only changes I made was I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, left out the cloves and found out my son had used up almost all my cumin. Luckily I had plenty of chile powder which did the trick. And I always use stewed tomatoes in my chile because I like it a little sweeter. Really good stuff!!!!

This was even better than I expected. I used sirloin stew cut meat instead of ground beef and doubled the chilies and garlic, but this is a fantastic evening base recipe to start from.

Very easy and turned out delish!! I didn't make any changes, except that I took 6 roma tomatoes, took out the core with an apple corer, and then threw them in a pan with some water, boiled them... crushed them up a bit when they were soft and added them plus the liquid to the rest of the ingredients... 
YUMMY!

Definitely a "do-over"!!!  My family loved it.... added 1 cup beef broth, some Worcester sauce, 1/2 small can of tomato paste &  substituted 1 can stewed & 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes since I didn't have canned whole tomatoes ....  The aroma was heavenly & it was delicious.

I never thought of cinnamon but it definitely sounds like a good idea. One old trick I learned when we were made to take Home-mec in junior high school. You need to use cloves, allspice and nutmeg all together. The trick is not to use too much. You use 1/4 to 1/2 a tsp each of them according to how big of a pot of chilli you are making. Too much will throw it off, but using just the right amount will make it impossible for anybody to have a clue what you had put in it. Even when I took a Meatprocessing coarse  for five months to become a meat cutter we used those three spices in several types of sausage recipes!

Great recipe!  I did substitute one pound of ground beef with ground pork, used one can each of pinto and black beans and used stewed tomatoes I had canned in the fall. Loved the addition of the cinnamon and cloves. Will definitely prepare again.

Added a little more chilli powder and used a habanero pepper for the chilli pepper for some heat . Also left out the cloves and cinnamon sticks.  Awesome combination ratio of simple ingredients.

I have say this was probably the worst chili recipe I have ever tried. I followed the recipe except for the beans I only had black beans. I realize that a chili like this uses red beans but it would not change the flavor that much. I spent an hour doctoring it and still couldn't fix it.

This is awesome chili. I've modified it slightly for slow cooking in the crock pot. Forget the oil and just place the raw meat in the bottom of the crock and set it for 6 hours.
Also, I add a can of whole kernel corn (drained) and a couple of chipotle peppers. The cinnamon and the smokey heat from the peppers make for a very interesting combination, and it never gets tired regardless of how many bowls you gobble down.

Made this yesterday and substituted ground cinnamon in place of the sticks.  My husbands comments when I asked him how it taste, it doesn't have much flavor!  My grown daughter said she didn't like the cinnamon. I can't taste so I have to go by whatever they say.  Was so hoping for the FINAL chili recipe.

This recipe is fine in terms of spices, variety and amounts. But, the amount of meat is WAY too much if you want to have any sauce or taste the beans. I ended up adding 1 more can of beans, plus two more cans of diced tomatoes (no salt added). I then nearly doubled the spices to account for adding all that extra tomato-y taste. Next time I would make the same recipe and just use 1 pound of meat. This recipe did taste good- I just think it needs tweaking for those of us who like more balanced chili - with plentiful beans and tomatoes.

Excellent basic chili recipe.  Not too spicy, not too bland.  However, it needs more liquid, so I added a can of beer.  That worked well.  I also tried Vidalia onions.  That was wrong.  The chili needs onions with more bite.  Also found out you don't need to rinse and drain canned beans.  Very easy, very fast.
