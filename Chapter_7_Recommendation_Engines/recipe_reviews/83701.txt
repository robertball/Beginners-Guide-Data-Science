I really liked it!  A good simple meal for a quick weeknight dinner.  I too cut back on the amount of macaroni, but used 1.5 cans of stewed, diced tomatoes, some butter and two crushed garlic cloves in addition to the cheese. Oh and I used sharp cheddar, monterey jack and mozzarella (all I had on hand), as well as a spoonful of sour cream, and it came out just fine. I imagine some cooked ground beef, turkey or shredded chicken would also go well with this dish.  Lots of options for a meal like this one and served with a nice side salad and some bread, it makes an easy and quick dinner for a hungry family.

This has been a family recipe for over 50 years - my mom and grandmother ran a restaurant and this was on our menu every Friday!  A few changes we make - we use canned whole tomatoes and squish them up with our fingers - they just always seem juicier and some folks don't like stewed tomatoes or always have them on hand.  We also add a lot of ground black pepper (I prefer fresh cracked but you can use ready-ground too).  Just as a note - this is NOT a creamy mac and cheese recipe - not meant to be!  The cheese will be rather clumpy and not spread throughout but it is marvelous that way!  One hint - if you do have leftovers, saute them in a little butter/margarine the next day - even better!!!!

I used only 1 lb. of medium shells but 2 cans of tomatoes and more cheese than called for, cutting the cubes into smaller pieces - used colby/jack, cheddar, and a few cut up slices of muenster.  I also mixed in about a tablespoon of butter into the hot, drained shells and mixed in the cheese, tomatoes, S&P,and some garlic in the hot pot to melt it down a little before putting into baking dish.  Came out GREAT and the leftovers reheated better than expected, too!

We really liked this recipe with a few changes.  I used less macaroni and rotel tomatoes instead of stewed.  Also added a little butter, garlic salt and seasoned salt.  I used shredded mexican blend cheese too.

A new favorite in the family. My husband and I have it almost monthly. :) We tried it also with fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Delicious and a little bit healthier. :)

It's okay. The added tomato flavor was nice but the cheese tended to melt and clump together into balls rather than spread like a sauce through the macaroni.

This is wonderful. To make it a 5 star, I added some garlic and onion powder. This could give Pizza Hut pasta a run for their money! Great mix of cheeses, the tomatoes pop with flavor outta the oven, and the combination of powders really top it off. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is o.k. Perhaps I used too much macaroni, as I found it to be too dry for my tastes. The kids' reaction was lukewarm, as was my husband's.

This was an OK recipe.  The cheese did not blend well through it, so at times it was like eating plain macaroni with tomatoes.  I won't make this recipe again.

This recipe was not bad, but it really only uses two different cheeses - colby and cheddar.  All cheddar is white unless coloring is added and then it is orange.  Perhaps one cheddar was mild and the other was sharp?

I cut the recipe in half; but used the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes as other reviews said this tended to be on the dry side.  Also, used an Italian blend of shredded cheese and topped with Italian bread crumbs.  It was very enjoyable and a different way to serve Macaroni with some garlic bread and a side salad.  Turned out to be only two of us for dinner today; so there are leftovers for tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing a quick weeknight dinner, KACAR0021 !!

My family liked this dish. I liked that it was easy to make, no white sauce to prepare. The only comments were that they thought there was a bit too much tomatoes, I would use half a can next time. I also used basil instead of oregano. It also is a tiny bit dry, I would maybe add just a bit of milk. But a very good base recipe, we'll make it again.

Very yummy and easy!  I only cook for 2 so I used almost a whole box of bow tie pasta, 1 can of chopped tomatoes seasoned with garlic and spices w. juice, 16 oz of cheddar, 4 oz of cheddar jack blend, and lots of pepper and garlic salt.  I put in a 9x9 baking pan and topped with more cheese and I mixed breadcrumbs with melted butter to finish it off.  I cooked for about 25min until edges were crispy.  So easy and my boyfriend took some leftovers to work today, he loved this recipe!

This recipes has been in our family for 3 generations ... however, I only use 1 lb of elbow and I melt the cheeses before mixing them in.  Also great with some cooked ground beef or leftover ham thrown in!

Quick, easy recipe that tastes good.  Could be a five-star recipe with modifications like minced garlic, etc.
Once again the 15 minute prep time is simply incorrect.  You cannot start water boiling, cook pasta and do the balance of the prep work in only 15 minutes.

I have been looking for a good and easy mac and cheese recipe that incorporates diced or stewed tomatoes. This definitely fits the bill. Very tasty, and I like to kick it up a little with cayenne or serranos.

Very bland.  Needs sharper cheese, spices (hot pepper), or something to add flavor.  Threw away - nobody hated it, but no-one wants seconds.

Been doing this for years because my family doesn't like the saucy cheese & mac. I don't do the bread crumbs. I use sprial pasta cooked instead and layer it with the shredded cheese then top off with crushed tomatoes. I then kind of knife through the top so it isn't all lumped on top. Then bake at 375 for 45 min. Excellent and simple.

Good, but quite bland. I halved everything in the recipe but did add 2 extra fresh tomatoes I had that were going to go bad. The cheeses I used were colby-jack, Irish cheddar, and gruyere...but could barely taste them. I will make this again, but with more stewed tomatoes, cheese with more punch, and some seasonings.

This recipe makes way too much for us and I find it challenging to cut it back by more than half because how do you use less than 1 can of tomatoes?  Having said that, it was delicious! Not sure how it would freeze but it wasn't that good reheated the next day so wasn't that good for lunches.  Not sure if I'll make it again just because it makes way too much for only 2 people. But it was good.

This got really good and everyone in family enjoyed it. My father-in-law said it was just like his mother used to make. Halved entire recipe, but used both cans of tomatoes. Should probably use diced tomatoes instead of stewed next time. Added 1/4 cup milk and a pat of butter to macaroni after draining to prevent clumping and make mixing with cheese easier. Shredded cheese instead of cutting in cubes, too. But, I forgot to snap picture.  Darn! Maybe next time ! LOL !!

I made it the first time as written, and thought it was too dry.  Then I made it again yesterday with one pound of pasta, instead of two.  It was delicious!!! This recipe is a keeper!

I used petite diced tomatoes and a mexican blend of shredded cheese. Also added garlic powder, onion powder and a bit of melted butter. Lots of ways to vary this with what you have on hand.

Excellent!  I added a splash of milk when I was melting the cheese down, and added a bit of cream cheese...   We used a pre-shredded mix of mozza, cheddar and Jack!  Very yummy - I couldn't stop eating it!

I took suggeations from other viewers and added a dollop of sour cream and some garlic powder.  When we used cubes of cheese it tasted better than when we used shredded - our imagination maybe??

I thought this recipe was very good and would make it again.  I might add a bit more tomatoes as it was a bit dry.  I served it with a vegetable and applesauce and no meat.  It hit the spot!
