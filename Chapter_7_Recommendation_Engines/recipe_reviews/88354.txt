I was skeptical of this recipe because, quite frankly, it looked a bit too easy.  I am used to more complicated cobblers.  I had some fresh strawberries in the refridgerator that I didn't want to go bad and decided to use them for this dessert.  I am amazed at how great the cobbler presented itself and tasted.  I used a stoneware pie dish and melted the butter in the oven as suggested but scaled back on the amount -about 3 Tbsp.  I mixed the ingredients as it stated and sliced the fresh strawberries onto the top (didn't place them in whole as they were extra large) until the top of the dish was blanketed with them.  I let the cobbler bake for about 50 minutes and served it warm with a dollop of cool whip on top.  Fantastic.  My dinner guest was quite amazed and impressed.  This was the easiest and one of the best tasting cobblers I've made to date (and I bake A LOT).  Next time I'll try experimenting with different fruits.

I really don't know what more you could ask for in either a recipe or a dessert. Five stars for ease of preparation. Five stars for straightforward instructions and easily available ingredients. And five stars for being delicious, heavenly comfort food. I made this as the recipe directed, only adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I think I had this in the oven in under five minutes from walking into the kitchen! Buttery, cakey topping, crispy along the edges, with a nice balance of fruit and batter. I used all strawberries, and can only imagine how good this would be with any number of other fruits as well. My only criticism, and it is a small one, is that I would like to see this fuller in the pan - as written, the recipe fills an 8x8 pan about half full. Next time I may try adding half again as much of both the batter and fruit ingredients so that it fills the pan more. However, who really cares so much about how it looks in the pan - it's what it looks and tastes like once it gets on your plate that counts, and this was gooooooood.

Been making this for ~15 years and it's great. Kind of surprised that Pam Anderson got a copyright on this recipe (2004); it's essentially a recipe that appeared in Cook's Illustrated magazine in ~1994 and even they admit they borrowed heavily from another source. The only difference is that CI's recipe uses 6T butter, which is in my opinion a better amount (see below). First let's explain what you should expect. This is not a conventional cobbler recipe; what you're going to get is a layer of fruit on the bottom with a very soft not quite custard-like cake on top. The butter that's been melted in the pan will sort of deep fry the edges and that is totally the best part. I agree with most of the reviewers that 3C of fruit is better than 2C, it's too thin otherwise. Also after much experimenting over the past 15 years it's better to add the fruit to the pan first and then add the batter. The fruit will end up on the bottom anyways and adding the batter last will ensure it's more evenly distributed and not just pushed to the edges. When you add the batter the butter will ooze up and around the sides and essentially fry the edges, 4T butter just isn't enough to accomplish this feat that's why 6T is better. Also don't just melt the butter, let it brown slightly it will greatly improve flavor. One last note, if you're using berries, especially raspberries, add an additional 1T of flour to the batter, which will help it not to be quite so "wet".

very good for a quick and easy dessert.  I used a mix of peaches and blueberries.  However, I would recommend using more fruit than recommended-closer to three cups makes it fruiter and less doughy.

I cannot believe that this only has 4 stars. Maybe a review by a pastry chef is in here somewhere; short of that level of concern for detail, I can't imagine not loving this. It was a total breeze - it took me 10 minutes to throw it together, and it was warm and yummy and just perfect. I'm not much of a baked-dessert person, but this was really impressive for how easy it is. (Oh, but I did add more fruit than it called for!)

Doubled this and made it in a 9x13 with 4 cups of blueberries and about 1/2 c bing cherries.  Yum!  Added about 1/4 t nutmeg, because we like nutmeg with blueberries.

I made this with peaches, and I thought it was great!! I just served it by itself instead of with ice cream because there is enough sugar in this alone. I will probably make it again sometime with these alterations... 1/2 cup more peaches, only 3 Tbs butter, and 1/2 cup sugar with an extra Tbs on top. It turned out a little creamy underneath with a nice golden crust on top. I also cooked mine about 65-70 mins vs. the 50-60.

I have made other cobblers that turned out delicious.  In this one the ratio of butter to milk to flour seemed wrong.  I followed directions anyways but the cobbler was soggy and greasy. It was just edible with ice cream.  There are much better cobblers on this site.

Easy and very delicious. I used nectarines and freshly pitted cherries, doubled the recipe for a 9x13 dish. It's a "cakey" cobbler, not a "biscuit" cobbler. I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to the batter. Next time I'm going to use all fresh blueberries. Yum!

Rated as the original recipe is written. It needs at least 50% more fruit, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. I have made this cobbler for years, only using more fruit. For those complaining of the fruit sinking to the bottom, that is what it is supposed to do. You want the dough on the top so it can brown. For those pouring the batter on top, this defeats the purpose of the batter rising through the fruit. For those that didn't like the dough/cake like topping, it is a cobbler, NOT a crisp-big difference. I have used self rising flour, and eliminated the baking powder and salt, but it is nice to have an alternative when you don't have self rising flour on hand. Buttermilk is also a nice substitute for the milk. This is a great recipe to throw together and put in the oven just before you sit down for a meal. I have also used a large 29 ounce can of peaches (juice and all)  instead of fresh fruit. Hot cobbler when you are finished eating can't be beat. Thank you for sharing.

A decent cobbler with peaches and blueberries. I used Jo's suggestion to use 3 cups of fruit. I also added a dash of cinnamon.

I had some frozen berries that I didn't know what I was going to do with...came across this recipe and tried it.  It was ok...I do agree with some of the other reviewers who said that they thought the butter batter ratio was off.  The batter turned out very thick for us and was too much for fruit (which all sank to the bottom of the cobbler).  I think I will keep my other recipe for this.  Thanks anyway for the post.

Great easy recipe for beginners, new brides, even college students (those who cook). This comes together very quickly. I wish I had this recipe when I was starting out. I've made this about 5 times. As with any of "allrecipes.com" recipes, I read the first few "most helpful" reviews so I can foolproof it. That being said, I cut the butter to 3 TBS, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, increase the fruit to 3 cups, pour half batter- cover with fruit- top with rest of batter, then sprinkle with 1 TBS sugar. I bake this in a deepdish 9 inch glass pie pan.  Double everything for 9x13. I've used strawberries, blueberries, blackberries- fresh and frozen- all have been great! Right now in the oven is a combo of all three as they needed to be used before spoiling. Serve with vanilla ice cream or cool whip!

This was so easy that I didn't think it would be very good.  But I was mistaken.  It was excellent.  I used fruit from my fruit bowl, nectarines, plums, peaches, blueberries.  Served with fresh cream, it was quite rich but not greasy or stodgy at all.  Son loved it.  I will make this agin.

Certainly easy, but very much satisfying! I have made this batter so many times; for breakfast, dessert or for a snack. I definitely liked it best with mixed berries, frozen and/or fresh.  Also good with either whole wheat or white flour, whole milk or skim. You can also get away with using less butter and sugar. Sometimes I use just 2 tablespoon of butter, and 1/2 cup of sugar and leave out the sugar on top - and the batter is still good.  Other times I used more or less fruit, and/or add a splash of vanilla or other spice.  I love "flexible" recipes like this one.  Since the recipe is easy, and the ingredients are all easily available - I suggest following the recipe exactly for the first time.  Then next time, you can just adjust the ingredients according to your liking.

Couldn't be easier (I used frozen mixed berries).  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I didn't add the extra sugar at the end.  Very good.  The cobbler was a perfect consistency and sweetness.  Thanks!

This recipe is good, but lacks a little punch.  I put in about 1/2 cup brown sugar (in addition to all of the ingredients listed here), & added about 2 tsps cinnamon to the batter.  I layered fruit on the bottom first, then poured over the batter, then layered fruit on top again.  I drizzled the last remaining bit of batter over the cobbler and topped it off by crumbling 1 TBSP brown sugar on the top.  Delicious!  (I have also done it by adding blueberries to the peaches).  Try this version.  I think you will like the kick!

Very easy, quick and delicious. I used a bag of frozen peaches, a container of fresh raspberries and I threw in 5 fresh strawberries that I had. My family loved it and I love finding something that is so easy to make, espeacially in the summer. I'll be making this again.

After having made this 2 times exactly as the recipe indicates, last night I made it again but added a 1/2 teas. cinnamon and a teas. of orange extract.  I also put the berries in the butter before pouring the batter over them.  Oh My!  This improved the flavor so much!  And that's saying a lot considering the recipe is great to begin with.  Yum and so easy.

Use 4 tablespoons of butter as called for in the recipe. Once the butter has melted in the pan, pour the melted butter into the batter when you add the milk. The batter cooks up crispy around the edges and the fruit doesn't all sink to the bottom. I've made this many time with a variety of fresh and frozen fruit. It's great when I need a dessert on short notice. I generally have the ingredients on hand, it's really simple and most people like it.

I thought this was one of the worst recipes I have ever tried on Allrecipes. I am not a novice cook or baker and the dough was terribly gummy. Would never make again. Sorry I didn't use my old tried and true which is very easy.

Easy and delicious!  Can not beat those two traits in a meal.  I used frozen mixed berries.  One trick I have found is to add the berries tou the outside of the 9x13 (because an 8x8 is just not enough).  Then the inside won't become oversaturated with berries and get too wet.

So easy. Doubled the recipe. Used more fruit, and a little less butter. Baked a full 60 minutes in 9x13 dish. Only good things to say, loved it!

Wow, this is fantastic! I had some fresh organic peaches and it came out perfect. I usually add less sugar than a recipe calls for, but this one was the right amount. I used 4 large peaches and I dipped in very hot water (but did not boil them) for probably 5 to 7 minutes, this makes easier to peel them.

This is now my go-to recipe for a simple, scrumptious cobbler!  SO easy!!  I used slightly less butter and sugar for mine, along with a mix of fresh blackberries and frozen blueberries.  Yum, yum, yum.  It was gone in two days!  Don't forget, when pouring batter in the pan, make sure you MIX the melted butter and the batter, or else it will be a greasy edged mess.

That was sooo good! I took some advice from previous reviews and reduced the butter to 2 Tbs and the sugar to 1/2 cup. I used 6 small ripe peaches and it turned out delicious! Thanks for a quick, easy and yummy recipe!

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan for about 65 minutes.  Didn't change a thing and the whole pan got eaten.  Great recipe.  This one is a keeper.

This was okay.  I thought the fruit fillng turned out well (I used blueberries) but the crust was wet, gooey and soft.  Cobbler should be soft inside, with a good outer crunch.   Too much butter in the crust recipe.

H thought this was the best ever. He loved the fact that it was so quick easy to prepare. He said it's not too sweet and was great served warm with ice cream. We used less sugar, and added vanilla.

I love the simplicity of this recipe and have made it twice now with fresh rhubarb (once with peaches mixed in).  Yum.  Based on reviews, I add about 3 C. of the fruit and a bit more milk, flour, and sugar -- about 1 C. each.  Watch the butter -- I'm going to try 3 T. next time instead of 4.   Can hardly wait to try different fruit.  Oh, I've successfully used both a large pie plate and a 9-inch square dish (lightly buttered).

this is one of the best recipes on this site as far as I am concerned.  This is really easy and it tastes great.  I also subbed frozen fruit for fresh.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you!

I've only recently started baking again & this is my first time making a cobbler.  I used self-raising flour, which I'd never used before, & it turned out great!  I think the only reason it took me 10 minutes to prep was waiting for the butter to melt while the oven preheated.   As per other peoples' suggestion, I used only 3 Tbsp. butter, which is still quite a bit, & you can definitely taste the butter in the finished cobbler.  Very rich!   I used 1c. blackberries & 2c. blueberries all from my freezer.  Very tasty!  The blueberries I used were very small "wild blueberries" & the 2c. were very dense, leading me to believe that 2 cups of very small, dense fruit would be enough for the whole recipe.  Larger pieces of fruit would be better suited to the 3c. recommendation that everyone made. The batter is very spongey (somewhere between a moist cake & a bread pudding) which is a great texture but very filling!  Like a thick oatmeal, my cobbler stuck to my ribs! Oh, other mods I made: 1/2c. white sugar & 1/4c. light brown in the batter & I used the light brown again to sprinkle over top with some allspice (because I LOVE ALLSPICE & I put it on everything!) EDIT:  I made this again the following night w/ Dole cling peaches (24.5oz jar).  Wow!  Even better than last night!  I'll try it again using part of the juice from the jar to substitute some of the sugar & milk, so I don't waste it.  I added about 1/2-3/4tsp. pumpkin pie seasoning & a splash of  vanilla to the batter.  YUM!!!

Excellent easy dessert.  I used peaches, raspberries (both fresh) and then frozen blueberries.  Served it with whipped cream.  Ice cream probably would have been better.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter.  I think it was a nice touch. Thanks for posting this recipe.  It will come in handy for serving last minute guests.

I made this exactly like the recipe. No changes or tweeks and it was supurb. I am making it again only with blueberries this time. This is the batter that molds itself all around the fruit; what we expect to see as cobbler at buffets, etc., steaming. I personally do not care for the bisquit type cobbler and for those of you who do, this won't be the recipe for you. The addition of the sugar on top, before it goes into the oven, is crucial if you want a crispness, somewhat like a creme brulee topping.

I would give it a three on taste.  But, since it took me a couple minutes to toss together and I probably have all of the ingredients memorized now, there are so few; I am giving it a four.  You could really play around with this and make it to your liking.  But as it is written, there was a little too much butter and ot enough "cobbler" to the amount of fruit that is suggested.

Added 50% more blueberries and it was amazing hot with vanilla ice cream - especially the crust!  I thawed frozen blueberries in a collander in the sink for thirty minutes so that their water wouldn't muddy the batter.  Easy and excellent!

Great simple recipe.  But, I would say that it is not appropriate for sweeter or riper fruits.  I used fresh blueberries and thought the batter was just a little too sweet to suit them.  Now, if I had added a tart peach to the mix, it would have been perfect.  Also, I saw lots of folks complain about mushiness.  I believe the problem is that they aren't cooking the cobbler long enough.  Mine-amounts as recipe states-took about 70 minutes before it was properly bubbling fruit and browned batter.  Don't take it out too early or it certainly will be mush.  Mine was too sweet to pair with ice cream, but, went great with whipped cream.  I would think this would be a five star if you stuck with peaches/plums/pears or even less-ripe strawberries.
Update: used same recipe with peaches and blueberries this time.  It had to cook about 90 minutes to get to the right consistency.  Although the taste was still great, it did not store as well as the blueberry-only version.

This cobbler is super easy to make - I used fresh strawberry's and I had this put together in 7 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly aside from the fact that I sliced the strawberry's since ours were on the large size. The problems I found with this recipe is that using 4 tbs of butter is way too much - my husband noticed an extreme butter taste right away which he did not care for. Also, the edges of the cobbler were extremely chewy - not appetizing at all. We did eat the cobbler warm with vanilla ice cream over the top. It was good but the overpowering butter flavor and chewy edges are why I gave this recipe 3 stars. I may try this again and use less butter and see how the edges come out...

Very easy and just delicious! I have made this many times now with all kinds of fruits: peaches, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, gooseberries,... Only thing I sometimes adjust is the amount of sugar, depending on the natural sweetness of the fruit.

Love this.  Someone mentioned gumminess...here's a tip for a crispier crust:  use a 9x13 pan.  Self-rising flour makes this extremely easy, and I always add a bit of vanilla.

My family loved this - my husband called it 'scary good' because you can't do with just one helping!  I served hot with vanilla ice cream on top.  I used fresh blueberries, and added cinnamon and nutmeg both.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to place berries closer to the edges when I add them as the crust got a little overdone around the edges (I used a glass 9x9 pie plate).  I will also try in an 8x8 baking pan to see if this makes any difference.  Thanks for this very easy and delicious cobbler recipe!

Easiest fastest recipe for cobbler ever. I used a small can of sliced peaches and a can of pitted cherries and drained both then simply arranged the fruit on top of the batter. This turned out fabulous and received raves from my husband. I used a pyrex pie plate. Lovely dish and was no effort at all. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I had 4 cups of fresh peaches, so I doubled the recipe.  I baked it in a 9 X 13 glass baking dish and along with the sugar I  sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  After baking for 60 min it came out perfect!  My four and seven year olds devoured it and my wife said she would eat the whole pan if she could.  You can't go wrong with this one.

This turned out excellent!  I made a few alterations/changes.  I substituted Splenda for sugar, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I used a 29 oz can of peaches, drained.  With these changes it turned out perfect!

"One Cup Cast Iron Cobbler" I've used this recipe for years now with several  exceptions, I use one cup of everything (flour, sugar, milk) as my recipe name reflects, use self-rising flour (White Lily), use closer to a stick of butter in a cast iron skillet... the crust bakes up to a buttery, crunchy golden brown and I use at least 3 cups of fruit.  It is a no-fail recipe sure to impress... eat fast it won't last long!

Taste was good, but it was too doughy and bake time was more like 75 minutes. Next time I will cut back on batter or add more fruit.

Just ok. It turned out pretty soggy and greasy, even though I cut down on the butter.

Awesome cobbler! The texture, the flavor, the sweetness, it was all good. I was thrilled to see it didn't require eggs because I don't eat eggs. I used frozen blueberries and whole wheat pastry flour. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

This is a very good recipe...I have been using this for 40 years and it is a no fail recipe. I use a bit more butter. I also love this with cherries or peaches.  This is the best.

When I gave birth to my daughter 12 years ago, a neighbor of ours brought us a complete dinner, and the dessert was a delicious blueberry cobbler.  I remember asking her for the recipe, and I recall her saying "it's just a cup - a cup - a cup, very simple".  She never did give me the recipe, but now I realize that this is it (except that she used 1 cup of suger-flour-milk-berries).  I did make the recipe exactly as written, but in hind-sight, I think I would do as my neighbor did and use 1 cup of the sugar, flour, milk AND berries.  While the recipe was still delicious as written, there were too many berries to cake/ratio for my liking.  I can't believe how quick and easy this recipe is though.  No kidding, it took me about 5 minutes to get this into the pan and into the oven.  I used cinnamon/sugar on the top and added 1 tsp of vanilla as well.  I will be making this one again, experimenting with other fruits.  Thanks so much!  I finally have the "a cup - a cup - a cup" recipe!

I don't understand why this is getting such a rave review.  I give it 1 star for the ease of preparation.  It took only a few minutes to mix the batter and place the strawberries on top with the sugar sprinkle with the butter on the bottom of the pan.  But the taste is just not good.  Only 1 tbsp of sugar for the whole dessert.  This was very bland and not what I would call a dessert.

I made this for our dessert last night and couldn't believe how FAST and EASY it was to assemble.  I used a combination of sliced peaches and a pint of fresh blueberries (about 3 cups total of fruit) and baked it in a 9-inch square ceramic pan.  Only because of my personal preference did I add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and a pinch of ground cinnamon to the batter.  The cobbler took exactly one hour to bake and came out fluffy, nicely golden brown and fruit bubbling.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely be making this again very soon due to the simplicity of this recipe and the current abundance of very inexpensive berries in my region.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

I made this yesterday with blueberries and strawberries.  I added a tsp of cinnamon to the batter, and I sprinkled sugar on the fruit before adding it to the dish, then again after.  The cobbler is already gone!  It was so delicious!  Nice crisp crust on top compliments the fruit very nicely.  I have another cobbler in the oven right now, this time with peaches.

As is typical of me, I preferred eating this cold. I used honey because I had no white sugar, just used a little less that 3/4 cup honey. Evaporated milk in place of regular milk. I had fresh strawberries and raspberries, so I added both to this. Topped it off with a combo of brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled all around. Very tasty...can't wait to have some ice cream with it!!

This was so easy, and I had all of the ingredients.  I did use whole wheat flour instead of regular, a 12 oz. bag of frozen dark sweet pitted cherries (thawed and drained), and sprinkled with some coarse turbinado sugar.  Also reduced the butter to 3 tbsp and it was plenty. It turned out beautifully, and was very tasty!  I look forward to trying it with different fruits.

3 to 4 cups fruit and 1 cup of flour, sugar and milk and an extra bit of baking powder works great for me. I have made it with bluebeurries and a strawberry blueberry combo. Easy and good everytime!

I made this with blueberries and blackberries that were on their last days.  I usually make recipes with high ratings because I know they will most likely turn out really well - but this one left something to be desired.  The dough part just wasn't what I expected at all.  It was very sweet and not very cake like.  It was certainly quick and easy to make, but I don't know if I will make it again.

EASY & DELICIOUS!  I could go on forever about how good this cobbler is!  Everyone who tries it loves it!  I have used fresh & frozen fruit (some times 2 cups, most of the time 3+), usually a combination (fresh peaches & frozen blueberries or blackberries being our favorites).  Canned sweet potatoes are another favorite we like to use. I usually add a heavy teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter.  And I sprinkle a generous spoonful of cinnamon (when you sprinkle on the sugar, right before baking), too.  The crust is amazing & it has just the right amount of sweetness.  The recipe as is, is perfection & can be easily doubled or altered (like adjusting the amount of butter, adding the vanilla extract & cinnamon, etc., etc., etc.,...) to your liking.  I've tried several different cobbler recipes, this is the best so far, by far!   It's so simple, usually have the ingredients on hand & you can mix it up with endless different filling ideas.  I won't be looking for any new recipes for this any time soon.  Absolutely a staple worthy recipe!  Thank you, Pam Anderson!

I thought recipe was too simple to be very good and I was right.  Flavor and texture were not pleasing to the palate. Fruit alone would have been better.

It looked really delicious coming out of the oven. Smelled good, too. The flavor, however, is lacking some key component. I'm not sure what it was, but, it just wasn't there. It is a good base recipe to play around with, though...I'll monkey around with it some more until I figure out what it is lacking. I used marionberries to make mine. Thanks for submitting the recipe, it truly is a great recipe for a beginning cook to try their hand at making a homemade cobbler.

Wow this is the perfect cobbler recipe-its not a crisp, but a true southern style buttery cobbler! I agree strongly that it needs more fruit-next time I will load it up.  Remember, the type of fruit you use will really affect both the sweetness and the consistency of the final dish. I used frozen wild Maine blueberries (tiny sweet berries) and frozen peaches. The result was superb.  Crisp on the edges, soft like a cake inside.  Cooked in a 9 1/2 inch pie dish for 65 mins.  Perfect! The beauty of a cobbler is that it is not a recipe that needs to be exact. Relax, use what you have or what is in season, think about the sweetness you want versus what the fruit naturally has and toss it all in. Foolproof!!

This came out beautiful.  I guessed on how much fruit I was putting in, but I doubled the recipe and used 3 large peaches, about 3/4 pound fresh strawberries and about 3/4 pint of blackberries.  I also took others' advice and used less butter.  Additionally, I swapped Splenda for the sugar.  I forgot to sprinkle sugar on top, will do that next time.  My cobbler turned out fruity, warm, and a bit custardy on the bottom.  We loved it!

Made this for another event at work and people went nuts. I did make this in a 9x 13 pan and took the advice of some of the other posters to make sure and double up everything. I used a combo of frozen blueberries, strawberries and cherries. I made a generous amount of the batter (doubled and a little extra) and put 1/2 in the pan, topped with the frozen fruit, and poured the rest of the batter on top. Baked for 1 full hour at 350 and served with whipped cream. Really easy, and delicious. Can't wait for fresh local in-season fruit now. This will most likely be my new go-to cobbler recipe.

I didn't love this as much as it seems like everyone else did. This isn't what I think of when I think "cobbler." It's more of a cake batter consistency that just hardens around the fruit. It tastes pretty good, but it really isn't a cobbler, in my opinion.

This is one of my favorite recipes passed onto me from my mom.  It was a childhood favorite and is my go to recipe when company comes.  It makes a nice soft cobbler with the most amazing buttery crisp edges.  We sprinkle a bit of cinnamon/sugar over the top before baking and vanilla ice cream is a must topping just before serving.

this was really good. i like my cobbler un-doughy and crispy around the edges.. like this one. i used fresh raspberries and the tartness went well with the sweetness of the bread. i liked the butter taste :) not diet-friendly but delicious. i am def going to try this with other fruits! served it warm with whip topping

This is not a bad recipe.  It was just okay. The only thing I changed in this recipe was added cinnamon.  I cannot imagine NOT adding the cinnamon.  It was very cake like and not very cobbler like.  Don't get me wrong, it was good and we ate it but this is not what I was expecting.

This is a great all around cobbler base. Dole frozen fruit, thawed, worked like a charm. I did double the recipe for a 9x13 pan, seemed to be no problems with the ingredient conversion. Adding a tsp of good vanilla last to the batter made a nice hint of lil'somethin extra. One tip I will also recommend is tasting your fruit for it's sweetness first, then sprinkle sugar/cinnamon & sugar on top before baking.

I didn't care for this recipe. prepared it to a T, except i used black berries. the batter/crust was chewy, on the edges, and it had a VERY weird taste almost like fig, but not in a good way. Will never use this recipe again for cobbler. Ill take the long route and do it the right way, no more of this "easy" kind of recipes.

This was very easy and the results were loved by all in my family.  I was nervous due to some reviews that said it was lacking in flavor but we didn't have that problem!  My neighbor brought over 4 bags of frozen blueberries from his garden from last year...I ended up using about 5 cups of blueberries and a recipe and a half of batter-but only using 3 or 4 TBSP of butter.  I did add a splash of vanilla...we ate it at room temperature, plain and even my blueberry hating son called it delicious!  I want to try it with some other fruit this summer!  YUM!

made recipe as noted.

too sweet (by 1/4 to 1/3 cup).

perfect in a 10" pie pan. 
don't skimp on the fruit.  use all fruit suggested.

cut butter to 3 tbps, could still be less.

This cobbler was very tasty.  I had to add a bit more sugar to mine because the blueberries I had were not very sweet.  Also, I think that the batter needs to be doubled.  There wasn't enough on it for my liking.  But overall, a good recipe.  Thank you!

Good.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup...it was plenty for the dough.  If using frozen fruit, may need more sugar to sprinkle on top of the fruit.

I made this with blackberries.  Very easy to make.  Consistency was okay, but the flavor was severely lacking.  Better try your luck on another recipe rather than waste prime fruit on this bust.

I used blackberries and blueberries, and I cut back on the butter (3 tbsp.).  This is a great recipe as written, but I think it would be just as great with 2 tbsp. butter (and of course, a tad healthier).  It's such an easy dish and you can change up the combination of fruits, which I love.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Considering how fast and effortless this recipe was, giant payoff in flavour. I added an extra half cup of fruit (I made a mix of peach and raspberry), and otherwise kept the recipe as is. Served with vanilla ice cream. Our dinner guests loved it and my mother in law asked for the recipe! :-D

Simple and delicious.  I followed the recipe without making any changes, using fresh nectarines & serving it with a dollop of French vanilla ice cream.  The perfect summer dessert.

I can't believe I haven't rated this before now!  I made this at least a dozen times over this summer when our blackberries were in season.  It was such a simple recipe and really excellent every time I made it.  I substituted yogurt for milk once (forgot I didn't have milk on hand) and have done other substitutions without issue.  It's a super easy recipe that's very adjustable...and much different from your normal cobbler.  We loved it!

I was drawn to this recipe b/c of the great reviews and b/c of the simplicity of the recipe.  I was very disappointed with the outcome, and can’t understand why it has such a high rating.  I used  fresh blueberries and fresh strawberries, and I followed the directions, with the exception of reducing the butter to 2tbps.  It turned out soggy/mushy in the center, but more cake like on the edges.  And by the following morning, it was even more of a mushy mess.  The taste wasn’t horrible, but certainly does not warrant making it again.  After discovering how it turned out, I reread the recipe several times trying to figure out where I went wrong, but I followed all the directions as written.  I will not be making this again.

I made this with fresh blueberries, and it was easy and delicious!  I only used 3 T. butter and I omitted the sugar on top.  I also used 1/4 c. whole wheat white flour and 1/4 c. honey, and it turned out plenty sweet and tasty.  I baked it in a 9" pie plate and it filled it quite nicely.  I would definitely bake this again and try different fruit combinations.

This was really good! However I added an extra cup of fresh blueberries and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the batter. Next time I will reduce the sugar in the batter because while delicious, it was a bit too sweet for our families tastes. It was very easy to make, I basically supervised while my 8 and 9 year old made it. I made it in an 8x8 glass baking dish. I cooked it for the entire 60 minutes. It came out of the oven looking like it wasn't cooked but after it cooled I could tell it was definitely cooked.

Only one word to describe this cobbler, AWESOME...Only change I made to this recipe was that I doubled this recipe and baked it in a 9 X 13 inch pan....added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the batter as well...I will DEFINITELY make this cobbler again...I made a blueberry cobbler using two pints of fresh blueberries, baked it for an hour....served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream....SUPER YUMMY

It's just as the title promises: Easy! Cobblers I have come across before have been very complicated. I was worried that because of its simplicity it wouldn't be a very good cobbler. But it was amazing! The crust came out perfect! A wonderful golden brown, crispy on the sides and nice and soft everywhere else. One person commented that the crust got soggy after a few hours, but I accidently left it out overnight and the crust on the bottom was softer but not really soggy or bad at all.   The only change I made to the recipe was I put one teaspoon of vanilla into the batter. Definitely do that! For the fruit I used frozen blackberries. I used a lot more than the recipe called for, one and a half 16 oz bags. How much fruit you put in really depends on your taste. I cooked it for 60 minutes and it was perfect.   Make this recipe! It is worth it!

This was a really good recipe.  I did use about 2 1/2 cup blackberries and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar mixture as well as sugar.  After making it, I realized it was similar to a cobbler also know as a "Lazy Man's Cobbler" that I have made before.  It was very good.  Don't let the milky batter fool you. It does cook up nicely.

I doubled this recipe but left the fruit amount the same.  This was so delicious.  The cake part of this cobbler is really amazing.  It might be the best part.   Next time though, I will use less butter.  I found myself, out of panic, using a turkey baster to suck out the extra butter.  I put this whole thing together and then read all the reviews.  There is an excessive amount of butter.  I used frozen berries and I also made tiny tiny cobblers in a mini muffin tin.  It worked out fine in the end and they were soo cute.  I sprayed the mini muffin tin with vegetable spray and then brushed the butter in the tins.  I added 1 tablespoon of batter and then topped with frozen berries.  Sprinkled on a bit of sugar and popped in the oven for about 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also was able to make a whole other cobbler in a 9 inch pan as well.  Very delicious and it was all gobbled up within minutes.  Thanks for sharing and I will be making this again.

My aunt gave me this recipe about 20 yrs ago.  I like it best with fresh strawberries but I've used canned peaches.  Its great no matter what fruit you use and very simple. A great recipe for kids who like to cook.

This recipe is wonderful but I also like my cobblers to be more "bisquit-like".  I used fresh nectarines and some frozen blueberries I had.  It was delicious and my family loved it.  I did have to cook it for longer than 60 minutes to get the batter on the bottom cooked all the way.

This was my first attempt at cobbler and it was awesome!!  My family and neighbors loved it.  I doubled it and used a 9 x 13.  I had just picked fresh blueberries so that's all I used!  Covered it with ice cream and we were good to go!

I just made this cobbler using fresh raspberries. Lookinf for something quick and easy for dessert I found this to be absolutely perfect. All the ingredients are mainly staples found everyday in your cupboard. What's nice about this is you can use a variety of seasonal fruit to your taste. It came out "Very Moist." I followed the  directions exactly as posted and it turned out perfect. I will definitely be using this recipe again and recommending it!!!!!

Other reviewers are right...beware once you start you just don't want to stop.  I went back 2 times for more!   I used a whole bag frozen mixed berries with cherries.  When I made the batter I added ground nutmeg and cinnamon.   I used brown sugar to sprinkle on the on the top with more cinnamon and nutmeg before baking.  I also had to bake for quite a bit longer than 50 minutes, but it was worth the wait.  Quick, easy and made with items I always have at home.

This is what cobbler should taste like. Mine turns out very buttery which is the perfect compliment to the tangy sweetness of fresh fruit. Beware... as it is very easy to have more than just one giant serving. Blue Bell is a great accomplice

I chose to use the frozen berries.  I never measure anything, especially when adding fruit, so I am sure I overcompensated on the "2 cups".  What's it gonna hurt if you have more fruit right?  This dish turned out great, so easy.  Will definitely make this again.  And soon!

seriously... MAKE THIS RECIPE! I tripled it and spread it between 2 8X11 baking dishes. I added 1 tsp vanilla, upped the butter by 2 tbsp per dish to "fry" the edges, and tossed each of my 5 cups of fruit w 1/4 c flour (so it wouldn't be soggy). I made one a strawberry/blueberry mix (5c) sprinkled w a little nutmeg and the other an apple/cherry mix (5c). If you like tart berry pie than try the straw/blueberry. If you like apple pie, the apple/cherry will make you smack someone lol Packing them both up now to share with some neighbors... afraid we'll eat it all! Thank you Pam for a new family recipe!

Good heavens, it just doesn't get any easier or more delicious. I followed recipe exactly except for using 3 cups of fruit - in my case blueberries. Just fantastic. So happy to find a recipe I can whip up super fast with staples on hand. Thank you !  Oh, one precaution: The crust is perfect when it comes out of the oven-chewy/a little crusty, just the way I like it. I covered the hot dish and the crust went from perfection to soggy bread pudding the next day. And it says 4 servings, that's 4 MONSTER LARGE servings. Or maybe 6 regular servings.

I've made this recipe many times. I agree with other reviewers that more fruit is better. I've made it with peaches, blueberries, cherries, rhubarb, just about anything. Every time it turns out perfect. It is so easy it's impossible to mess up.

I discovered this recipe a few months ago when I realized I had a ton of frozen blueberries to use. I usually double the recipe except I just use 6 Tbs of butter, use 5-6 cups of frozen blueberries, and add cinnamon  and nutmeg.

My family loved it when I made it for a family bar b que last weekend. I added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter and about 3 cups of a combo of frozen peaches & blueberries. My son didn't remember the ice cream so we ate it plain. It was great all by itself. I will make this all summer long with all kinds of fresh fruit. Thanks so much for the recipe!

very easy. I made with blackberries and increased to three cups of fruit because of a review I read. I thought it was delicious. It is like a moist cake filled with fruit. Will make this again and try other fruits

I followed advice of others and added 3 cups of frozen blueberries and used I can't believe it's not butter.  So easy and next time I will decrease sugar a little.  My husband and I don't like super sweet - this was not over the top sweet so a little tweaking will work.  Frozen blueberries worked beautifully in this.  BTW, I set my toaster oven for 50 minutes - 45 would be better since one edge was a bit dark.

This is delicious.  I made this with blueberries and mixed them through the batter, then sprinkled an oatmeal streusel on top - no need for ice cream.

I had exactly 4 cups of blackberries to use up. I looked at a bunch of bb cobbler recipes, and I think I hit the jackpot with this one. I doubled the ingredients. Then, I eyed up my 9x13 pan and decided on the 8x11 instead. It was perfect after 50 minutes. The batter was nicely golden, and it really looked great. The fruit did not end up on the bottom as stated in other reviews. Seasonal fruit seems to do best with this type of recipe, with basic ingredients that let the taste of the fruit shine. This recipe is now in my Favourites folder.

After picking blueberries I wanted a great recipe for cobbler. First cobbler I have made, and I'll never look for another recipe. I tripled the recipe and cooked in 13 1/2 x 8 3/4 x 2 dish for a large group. Took others' advice to go light on the butter, and will try even less, 1/2 c for triple recipe, next time. This was so easy! Many commented on how delicious it tasted!

I have used this recipe a lot, and it is really nice and easy!  I will say, I augmented the recipe a bit by melting only half of the butter in the pan, and the rest I added to the batter.  My idea was that when you add the butter to the bottom of the pan and then add the batter on top of it, the butter pools up along the side.  When it bakes, the sides can brown a lot, but the middle doesn't brown at all.  Mostly because butter browns so much quicker than the sugar/flour.  Also, if you can let the cobbler rest for a while before serving, it is sooooo much more tender!

I made this with fresh blackberries from the garden and peaches I had in the fruit bowl.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, added some Quaker oats and decreased the butter and milk by one tbs to compensate for the juice in the fruit.  It made a great and relatively healthy breakfast for my grandkids.  They loved it!

To the person who wouldn't make this recipe because of its unhealful qualities, you missed out, sister!  You don't have to eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner, you know.  It was Ahhhhhhmazing.  Based on Naples review about quantity, I changed the servings to 6 but kept it in the same 8"x8" pan, baking until bubbly and golden, about 60 mins.  I stuck to the recipe, using coarse sugar for the top.  Seriously, it was in the oven in minutes, and nothing short of fabulous when it came out.  HOWEVER!  The next time I make it, I will cut back on the butter and sugar by 1/3, for personal preference only, I just felt that it didn't have to be as sweet as it was...didn't stop me from eating half the pan, though!  This recipe will not disappoint!

I have been making this for years and years, the best cobbler recipe I have found.  Make just as directed and it will come out perfect every time and so easy to assemble.  In fact right now I am going to make a strawberry one for dessert tonight. Yumo!!!

I tried this with fresh apricots and blackberries. the bottom and middle didn't set or cook through, though the corners were a dark brown. Tasted ok. I will try this again before I give up on it, but with different, or less fruit.

Wow, best and easiest cobbler ever....I used three cups of fruit in a deep dish pie plate.  Two cups sliced strawberries, 1 cup raspberries.  I followed reviewers' suggestions of adding melted butter to batter after spreading it around the plate.  I also used 2 T butter and 2 T smart balance. Plus I put about 1 t vanilla in batter and 1/4 t nutmeg....On top I sprinkled 1 T of sugar crystals which melted nicely

Incredibly easy and good flavor. I used frozen berrries for mine because nothing is in season right now. The only disappointment was the texture. It was a bit spongy and strange. Not likely to make this again as there are better recipes out there.

Perfect recipe. It has a rich buttery taste with a great combination of sweet fruit flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh blackberries and raspberries. We ate it warm and did not add anything to it. Fantastic! Can't wait to try other fruits. Also, couldn't be easier!

All I have to say is YUM. I was a little worried about how it would turn out but not a single complaint. I read that if not eaten right away it gets soggy, but mine was still perfect for breakfast.  As always I used this as a base, used 1 cup flour because it seemed a little too wet for me, most likely used way too much butter on accident because I really didn't measure it, which made the crust a little crunchier and a little buttery in flavor. I also added nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon to taste, canned peaches, and sprinkled with a little brown sugar. The recipe was not really altered and it was fantastic. I will be making this again.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and absolutely love it. Instead of using fresh fruit, I just thaw some of the frozen berries from the grocery store and it still turns out great.

Delish! made it just as directed and turned out super yummy. Maybe a little gooey in the center, but I like it like that. Kiddo's loved it too and is a good way to use up over ripe fruit and/or frozen fruit.

Loved this!  Made it with Blueberries and Nectarines and it was absolutely delicious!  I did up my fruit amount based on another review-  I like my cobbler more on the fruity side vs. doughy side.  It was so easy and my husband was very impressed (he obviously didn't realize it only took 5 minutes to throw together!)  Will make this again!

I love this cobbler! I've made it with lots of different fruit. Even when I don't think I have any fruit, I make up a new creation! My kids think it's funny. Last night all I had was one can of mandarin oranges so I put those in and also put lemon extract in the batter. I told my kids it was called Citrus Cobbler!

This recipe was fine, but I was disappointed with it after seeing all the wonderful reviews.  The fruit itself is what made it good. I guess the best thing about this recipe is how easy it is.  I prefer a crumb topping to this type of crust/batter, and I don't think a crumb topping is much harder to make. Next time I will make a traditional cobbler.

Follow the recipe exactly; it took less than 10 minutes to make, very easy and was delicious.  Made one with peaches and one with blackberries.  Peach was the favorite.  Lots of compliments on it!

I didn't realize until I had begun making this that the recipe was actually somewhat of an "upside down" cobbler, but I was committed to doing something with some of the fresh Georgia peaches I had, so I went ahead. Overall I'm much more a fan of fruit crisps (or crumbles), but my boyfriend is a cobbler fan, so to keep the peace... I switch off. ;) However, to me cobbler is more of a pie like topping on fruit. This cake-like, bake through the fruit dessert was tasty, but I think there are much better recipes out there. I baked this for 70 minutes and still thought it was too doughy!

Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best...and this is no exception.  Used fresh GA peaches and threw in a few blueberries and it was delicious.  Made no changes.  Perfect.

This turned out really well and was just what I needed to celebrate the ending of school.  I only made one serving and cooked it in a small stone ramekin.  It turned out delicious, even though I used much less butter and sugar than was called for.  Note: If you're making this for one person only, cook it for no more than 30 minutes or it will burn.  My single-serving turned out very well and I will definitely make this again.

7/5/11 UPDATE:  I made this again with peaches and it was equally delicious.  I used 3 cups of fruit this time which worked well.  Original review:  This was soooo easy and soooo delicious!  I made mine with raspberries.  I agree, however, with the reviewer that said this needed more fruit.  It was a little skimpy, but that can easily be resolved.  With all kinds of wonderful berries in the markets, I know I’ll be making this again very soon!

We're not sure what cobbler should taste like having never had it before, but this is weird (bake time, and looking) but very good ...ours needed less sugar as the cherries we used were super sweet, so recommend tasting your fruit and adjusting to taste! Good recipe, thanks!

This was the most amazing cobbler ever.  I used a mixture of fresh peaches, strawberries and blueberries. Topped with ice cream and served warm.  My family demolished this dish. Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

Delish! Just enough sweetness and what a way to end the day. I followed recipe to the "T". I used 2cups of strawberries and blueberries...all fresh. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to be batter. At first batter seemed a little small but as it baked with the fruit it evened out. I think next time I will double the batter. The top turned a nice golden color on top and the aroma was just awesome. It took 55 muntes to bake. I topped it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Super easy and extremely tasty! I have made this recipe 2 times and have used frozen sliced strawberries. Can't wait to try it with other fruits.

The only good thing about this was that it was easy. Didn't have much taste, was quite bland, and I didn't care for the egg like consistency of the cake. I served it a party and it sadly got very poor reviews.

I love cobblers and have several outstanding recipes.  I only made this because it looked so easy (should have known better, right?).  I used a ceraminic, deep dish pie pan.  The only change I made was to add a touch of cinnamon to the batter and increased the fruit by 1/2 cup, using 2 1/2 cups of fresh fruit.  On that note, I used fresh strawberries, blueberry and blackberries.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked it for one hour.  On the edges, the batter does rise up and brown.  Otherwise, this was one big fat gooey, sticky mess.  Sorry, but I know my way around a kitchen; especially in baking and this one doesn't work for me.  In trying to figure out the problem I noticed when pouring the batter into the melted butter (that is strange), the butter seems to move to the out edges.  Notice that?  Also, fruit does put out a lot of liquid during cooking.  Maybe it could be eaten with ice cream but I'll probably consider it a loss.

Everything was great about this recipe - easy and delicious!  I followed the advice of other comments and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and about a cup more fruit.  Yum!  I'll definitely make this again!

After reading the recipe I'm realizing it the essentially the same one I've made forever but with more steps.  One cup milk, one cup Bisquick, and one cup of sugar: mix, pour over a cup of fruit, drizzle with butter and sugar and bake for one hour at 350. Even easier.  More cake like but still yummy.

Cobblers are the best & simplest mistake-proof pies to make....add rhubarb to the list of fruit that is super in a cobbler..my batter is plopped on top of the fruit & baked...even better than vanilla is Creme Brule ice cream, especially on a peach cobbler.

love it! I used frozen raspberries and it worked great. I added a bit more than called for just because of what others said, but I think it would have been just fine as is. Next time for fun I might add some crushed and toasted nuts on top and maybe some oatmeal to the batter, but it does need a thing. I did have to bake it a bit longer (about 80 min.) and turned down the oven to 300 deg. after about 60 min. so the edges would get over cooked when the middle was still doughy. Thanks for the recipe.

Fast recipe and very good! I made mine with frozen peaches and threw in about a half cup extra of fruit. I tend to like more crispy crust, though, so I think I'll try cooking it about 10 -15 min longer next time.

Very easy to make and all ingredients are basic. I thought there was a little too much butter, next time I will reduce to maybe 3T. and see how it is then. I'm afraid if I reduce it too much it will stick in the pan. The "cobbler" part gets sticky and chewy on the outside and stays moist and tender towards the middle and inside. Adaptable to any fruit and really couldn't be easier to make and is pretty good. Best served luke warm.

I made this after a suggestion on the recipe buzz. At the first bite I had thought it tasted a little bit bland. But, the same person suggested to put in a bowl with some sugar sprinkled on top and some liquid. So, I sprinkled with sugar and added some milk and it tasted fine. It also tasted better once it cooled some. I thought the mixing took some time to get all of the lumps out and think a mixer would have been easier. I don't know if it is something I would make again, but it was fine to use up some blueberries today.

So simple and delicious!  I made this the first time with guests for dinner.  I was nervous when I assembled the dish but as it baked I was watching and drooling through the oven door.  My only points would be that there seemed to be a bit too much butter.  My cobbler filled my baking dish to the top and the only thing that overflowed was butter.  The cobbler certainly didn't taste like it was missing butter, so I'll try it with less next time.  The sugar will definitely depend on your fruit, but even a sugar addict like me thought it would be fine with a bit less (and I had even bathed my fruit in lemon juice as I chopped it a couple hours before our guest arrived so it would be ready to put together and pop right in the over when I pulled our main dish out).  Next time I'll try adding a good dose a cinnamon, a splash of vanilla, and cut back the butter and sugar.  A great recipe as is though - thank you!

Yum! I was browsing for an easy cobbler with ingredients I had on hand when I cam across this. My husband nearly ate the whole dish! I followed the recipe exactly except for melting the butter in the microwave rather than the oven and I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries. It was fantastic! This is a definite keeper and going into my file ASAP!

So I have to say this was really delicious. I did follow previous reviews. I only used 3 tablespoons of butter (honestly 2 tablespoons might be fine as well) and I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also used 1% milk - it's what I had in my fridge. I used mostly frozen blueberries, but I did also have a peach on hand. So I threw that in as well. After 60 minutes, it came out looking beautiful. I topped the cobbler with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt. YUM!!!

super easy, and tasty. a great way to use up extra fruit. I double the batter, use half the butter, put it in a 9x13 pan and load on the fruit. If I am using heavier fruit i add a bit of quick oats to the batter.

This was very easy to make, though I had to double the recipe. I found the butter level was fine, I just had to whisk it into the batter after I poured it into the pan. The cake was delicious, but I wouldn't recommend using only raspberries as it can be a tad too tart! Next time I'll try peaches with cinnamon instead. My husband loved it anyway!

Very simple and pretty good. Just two thoughts - I agree with those that thought there was a bit much butter, probably 3 TBSP. is plenty, maybe even 2 would be OK. Also, the center got a bit soggy, but I had a bunch of peaches to use up, so I probably put in a few more than called for - so use caution if you want to increase the fruit. That said, the crusty bits of the cake that puffed around the edges of the pan are yummy, I have been stealing them! ..probably will try again with these tweaks.

Oh yum!  To the batter, I added some nutmeg and twice as much cinnamon... I used fresh peaches... so easy and so yummy.  Served with shush (whipped cream)... hit that sweet tooth spot without over-whelming!  Thanx for the recipe.

I have made this 3 times now, first with fresh nectarines, then fresh peaches, and lastly with fresh peaches and fresh blueberries. I think that 3 medium sized peaches is just the right amount of fruit. The only change I made is to sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on top before baking. This recipe is so easy and for 2 people is just the right size, with leftovers for the next day. Great with vanilla ice cream.

I used three cups of fruit (two cups of fresh blackberries and one cup of sliced strawberries) and decreased the butter to three tablespoons.  I got lots of compliments on this dessert.  It was so easy to prepare.

Very easy to put together for a basic cobbler. I used a mix of strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Like others, I added about 3 cups of the berries. To the batter I did add about 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I will use this recipe again, especially if I need to put something together quickly.

i liked this recipe!  it was cakey, but i expected it to be that way after the last cobbler recipe i tried.  i guess i significantly made substitutions - whole wheat flour, fresh sliced strawberries and blue berries, and soy milk.  i doubled the recipe, too.  it was great - sweet enough for me (my hub enjoyed it, too, but he would have liked it a bit sweeter).  this was uncomplicated and scrumptious.  i'll be making this again!

Excellent flavor and so easy.  Followed the recipe, using all blueberries for the fruit - not too sweet for our taste.  I added some cinnamon to the tablespoon of sugar, coated the blueberries in Minute Tapiocca, and sprinkled lemon juice on the blueberries.

This was super easy and very good!  I think i'll follow other's advice and next time cut back on the butter to at least 3 tablespoons instead of 4.  It doesn't make a huge pan of cobbler, so i'll make sure to double the batter from now on.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  And, for the fruit, I used a 16 oz bag of frozen strawberries, blackberries and raspberries.  Tastes great right out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

This is the best, easiest cobbler recipe ever! I adjusted the servings to 6 (instructions and quantities within recipe do not change so adjust accordingly) and used a 9" square pan. Used coarse sugar on top. I love that the batter layers on the bottom and bakes up enveloping the fruit. Fabulous - company worthy!

Very easy, I used cherries and I think next time I will use about twice as many.  This was best right out of the oven but okay after a few hours. I think we will just be sure to eat the whole thing every time I make it.

This is so yummy and so easy that you have to try it!  I pretty much followed the recipe as is though I'm horrible about measuring things.  I made this with fresh blueberries and strawberries! When it came out, I would've said it serves more like 6-8, but 4 of us adults finished it off.  So good!

Very Good.  I was having freezer problems and had quart bags of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries that needed to be used.  So I added a bag (not sure of the actual amount of berries in each bag) of each to a double batch of the batter with a few changes.  I only used 1 cup of sugar, plus a teaspoon of cinnamon, cut the butter to 6 tablespoons which after melting in the oven and coating the bottom of a 9 x 13 cake pan mixed the rest into the batter and baked it for 75 minutes.  Definitely will make again.

I won't make this again. Like another reviewer said, soggy and greasy. It looked unappealing with the butter slick on it, and was mushy. AND it was way too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly. Too bad, it was truly easy to put together. Sigh.

I made this for dessert tonight and it was excellent. Followed the recipe to the letter, except I used a 12oz bag of frozen raspberries.  Easy to make, fast, delicious.  I've hidden the rest to have with my coffee in the morning. Great recipe.

I made this with frozen peaches, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. I followed naples' suggestions, adding a tsp of vanilla to the batter, and also adding an extra half-recipe to fill the pan better. The only issue I had was -baking in a 9 inch round pan- the outside finished more quickly than the center. I had to drop the temperature to finish the batter in the middle. It was ever so slightly burned, but vanilla bean ice cream masks that pretty easily! When I make this again (which I absolutely will!) I might drop the temperature to 325 and cover for the first 20 minutes just to make sure that it cooks more evenly. I'm not even sure you'd have this issue with fresh fruit.

I've made this several times with a variety of fresh or frozen fruit.  I've found that the baking time needs to be adjusted to about 45 minutes or it tends to burn.  My family loves it warm or cold with whip topping.

I haven't made many cobblers (and it's been a looong time) so I can't say this is the best I've ever had, but it was good.  My only 'negative' is that the servings are waaaay understated.  I made half the recipe with 1 cup of blackberries, baked it in a 9x6 pan and according to the recipe there should be 2 servings.  I think I'll be able to get 5-6 servings out of it which means 10-12 for a full recipe.  Good thing is waaay less calories than it says!

Have made this twice, both times with blueberries, and doubled it (put it in a 9x13 glass dish).  Served with vanilla ice cream. Recipe used as is except I added a few shakes of nutmeg and half wheat flour/half all purpose.  I will save this recipe and definately use it over and over. Thank you!

I was not impressed with this cobbler.  I thought it would be much tastier based on the reviews.  I found it to be pretty bland except for the fresh peaches and blueberries I used.  I will not make again.

I made this with fresh peaches and it was so easy and delicious - I thought the batter needed a little something so next time I will make it with a little vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  Overall though you can't find an easier quicker recipe - great!

I have made this recipe so many times, with either fresh or frozen fruits including dark sweet cherries, rhubarb, and most recently fresh blueberries--always perfect.  This time I didn't notice I didn't have enough granulated sugar so I substituted part of the sugar with brown sugar, and I liked it even better!  It made for a more crispy cobbler. I also always add a teaspoon of vanilla, just gives it even more of a zing!

I had too many nectarines ripen at once and a ton of blueberries after I went picking.  I made this almost exactly as written but also substituted Splenda for sugar and it was perfect!  I can't wait to make it again and try other fruits.

This is absolutely the epitome of comfort food.  The batter bakes all up and around the fruit to make a cake-like dish that is studded with fruit (in my case, peaches) and the cake part is soft and delicious, and just perfectly golden on the top and around the edges.  This recipe is perfect! Don't change a thing!

I usually refrain from reviewing recipes when I modify them but this was really good so I wanted to share my changes. I used reduced fat butter, Splenda instead of suger, and skim milk. I used fresh rasberries from my garden. Even my sister, who doesn't like "baked fruit" liked this. The fruit still tasted fresh and the "cobbler" part was delicious. Served it with a dollop of fat free cool whip on top. Yummy!

This was good.  Very easy, but next time I will change a few things.  I would use less butter, maybe cut it down to 2 or 3 tbsp, and I would top it with some kind of streusel.  I mixed a little bit of cinnamon with the sugar to go on top and it was a nice flavor.  I used all blueberries, and I actually think I may have used a little too much because the ratio of cake to fruit was a little off, but delicious none the less.  I cooked mine for 50 minutes exactly and it came out perfectly brown--my favorite part is that the edge of the cobbler was all caramelized and crispy... soo good!

This was delicious! The only thing is that I wish the batter part was crispier. I used strawberries and frozen blueberries. Instead of granulated sugar on the top I used about 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar ( I baked it in a 13 by 9). I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I'll definitly make this again because it was incrediably easy and yummy!

This was great!  My 13-year-old brother, who is usually wary of fresh fruit, ate a lot, and my mom and I liked it too.  It was sweet but not too sweet and a great texture.  I baked mine at a slightly higher temperature so it would be ready earlier.  I used half blueberries, half strawberries, and I did quarter the strawberries into chunks because they just looked too big next to the little blueberries.  It looked great in the pan as well as when it came out, and I had no problems whatsoever with this recipe.  First five-star rating I have given on this website.

My husband hates cobblers and he ate half of it for his father's day dessert! THAT SAYS IT ALL!  fyi - I was out of baking powder and substituted 1 tsp baking soda with 1 cup of sour creme, then reduced milk to 1/4 cup. Delicious...

I have to agree with the other 200+ reviewers that this is a winner. I made mine with fresh blueberries and followed the recipe as written. It was ridiculously quick and easy to put together and baked while we ate dinner. I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt. The only change I made was to decrease the baking time. I'm sure it's just as yummy with other fruits as well. Another fantastic recipe from Pam Anderson!

Very good, no-fuss dessert! I love the fact that I can assemble the ingredients in about five minutes and pop it in the oven to bake while we're having dinner. By the time we finished and got around to being ready for dessert, the cobbler was the perfect temperature. I used 1c. frozen peaches and 1c. frozen blueberries. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for when I need a dessert in a hurry!  UPDATE: Made this again last night and substituted brown sugar for the white. It was great. No one could tell the difference.  :)

Was this not soggy for anyone else? It presented beautifully, and looked amazing, but it was a tad on the soggy side after about an hour, if I decide to make this again, I will double the mix and pour extra over the top of the fruit. Needed some brown sugar I think to take away from the immense tartness of the fruits.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I had the boys I nanny help make it (and eat it of course). They loved it. I added some extra fruit just because I like berries. :) Definitely will be making this again!

I thought this was quite good and the perfect recipe for eager little hands to help with. I used fresh raspberries and served with fresh whipped cream. Everyone loved it! The batter does come out a little spongy, but tastes sweet and plays off nicely against the tartness of the berries. My kids are looking forward to making this one again.

This was incredible and was so easy to make. The batter was so quick to prepare and wasn't too sweet. I used about a quart of home canned peaches (drained) and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top before baking. Very good!  I make this again and again and it's a big hit. This last time I ran out of milk and just used water and it turned out good too.

UPDATE: I've also made this with apples and everyone loves it. Better than mixed berries. I love this recipe because ratio of flour to milk to sugar is the same so I dont need to pull out the recipe anymore. I've also made just the batter in the microwave (omit the butter, you don't need it)- in 2 minutes we have "cake"! topped it with heated sliced strawberries (found in the freezer section at the store in the plastic tub, already sliced with lots of juice when defrosted) and whipped cream.

--------------
Wow! This was so easy and so tasty. I am not a cobbler snob in any way - I like fruit. I like dough. And I love combos of the two.  I made this in a 9x13 pan, so I about doubled the recipe. I used 3 10oz bags of frozen fruit (blueberries, raspberries, and peaches, 1 bag each).  I read several cobbler recipes before settling on this one and followed the tips to add some cinnamon to the batter and to the fruit and I am glad I did. Even though I doubled the recipe, I did not double the butter. I had about 6-7 tbsp in the pan. When I poured in the batter, it looked too oily, so I took a couple tsps out and it was fine. I baked the cobbler for about 1hr 10 min and it was cooked through, the crust was a dark golden brown. Definitely a keeper!

very easy recipe!  I used a combination of fresh peaches, blueberries and strawberries that needed used up.  I added the vanilla as suggested.  I would probably try adding some cinnamon or nutmeg next time, depending on the fruits I use, just to see.  But very good recipe as is!

this is my new favorite recipe.

it's completely fool-proof! 
i tend to use less butter and sugar than the recipe calls for though.

i have made this recipe 4 times with different fruit variations. and it has turned out wonderful each time. my favorite so far is  red plum & strawberry or blueberry & nectarine.

This is very good for a quick and easy dessert. I found it a little sweet for my tastes - next time I'll reduce the sugar a bit.  Beware that its a rather thin batter, but it does firm up during baking. I doubled everything and baked it in a pie pan.

We LOVED this cobbler. I was looking for a way to use the Nectarines from our tree and this recipe was PERFECT! The only change I made was to sprinkle a little cinnamon over the top before baking.

I've tried several cobbler recipes and this is by far the easiest and very tasty too. I used freshly picked raspberries and subbed some brown sugar (probably less than 1/4 c) for part of the white. I used all 4 T of butter. Served it warm with whipped cream. Excellent. I'm deleting my other cobbler recipes and just keeping this one.

Very good, and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh raspberries plus a handful of fresh blackberries. (I might have had slightly more than 2 cups overall.) This is a cake-type topping rather than a biscuit-type topping. I did notice that the texture was slightly sticky (maybe from the sugar on top getting caramelized?), and I guess that's what some reviewers mean by "gummy", but I didn't mind it at all. I personally prefer a biscuit-like topping, but this was good and easy and my husband loved it, so I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was easy, fast and delicious!
I took a previous reviewer's reccomendation and only added 1/2 cup sugar to the batter mix.  i also added a splash of vanilla extract and a few sprinkles of cinnamon to get a bit more flavour.  at first i thought that it wasnt enough fruit, i used about 2 1/4 cup frozen fruit and dabbed up some of the moisture after i defrosted it, but it was a perfect amount!  YUM will make this again for sure!  it only took me the 50 min to cook it.

I've made this easy cobbler using fresh and frozen fruit and it turns out every time. I do add a capful of vanilla to the batter and depending on the fruit, add cinnamon or lemon zest to the sprinkling of sugar prior to baking. Any flavored sugar would add a nice twist.

Although I liked the flavor of this, it was gooey in the middle and starting to get too brown on the outsides after 50 mins. It did taste very good with fresh strawberries I had. Also very easy.

My hubby and I loved this recipe! I made a few changes: gluten-free flour, Splenda, doubled the recipe, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and added a little more peaches than the recipe called for. It was quick, easy, and super tasty with the ripe peaches I used. I will make this again for sure!!!

This is good, but more cake like. I used a 1/2 cup of sugar and added some cinnamon and real vanilla to cake. I had 2 cups of peaches, strawberries, blueberries and some canned mandarins that all needed to be used, so they all went in topped with a little nutmeg and a sprinkle of sugar. Very easy, looks appealing and taste good.

If you want a cake-like recipe, this is probably what you're looking for.  Don't be fooled by the name, this isn't a cobbler.  We used fresh blueberries - it was just okay.  There are other recipes on this site we've liked more.

I  like the ratio of ingredients much better than most cobblers in this one. Usually they want a whole stick of butter and I feel like that's too much. This was just right. I added vanilla to the batter.

I followed the advice of another reviewer to add 2 more TBSP of butter, and an additional cup of fruit.  Used 1c Peaches and 2c Strawberries cut into chunks.  Added a dash of cinnamon and used brown sugar on the top.  Really like this.  I almost never make cobbler, but had fresh fruit I needed to use up.  Five stars for ease and taste.

Blueberry Easy Batter Fruit Cobbler was super yummy satisfying. It WAS very easy to make. I had a large bag of frozen blueberries and chose this recipe because it was the first recipe which specifically called for frozen fruit. I didn't place the berries evenly enough and thee was a opening in the middle with the rest having the "crusty cobbler" part. That part was delicious. It was chewy, custardy, puddingy and perfectly crunchy. I can wait to make it, again and attempting to spread the batter even and have more batter per fruit ratio. All in all... Amazing! Simple! Good!

Super easy to make with stuff I had on hand. We used fresh blueberries and it was great.  I personally would cut down on the sugar some but the rest of my family wouldn't!

Not sure how you can mess this recipe up other than not cooking it long enough.  I followed it to the letter and it was perfect.  Crunchy and chewy on the outside with the fruit turning into a jelly on the bottom.  I thought the proportions were perfect.  If you are southern, it will take you back to your childhood.  Thanks for sharing.

So easy and delicious.  I used about 2 cups nectarines and a cup blueberries.  Topped with Alton Brown's whipped cream recipe and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  A perfect refreshing small dessert for 6 guests with no leftovers for those who count calories.

I have made this cobbler and it is quick and easy; however, I found an easier way---I use Bisquick with the added sugar.  Each time it comes out great.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 6 tblsp of butter and about 3 cups of fruit (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and peaches...the main color comes out blue). For the batter, I was glad that I cut back by 1/4 cup on the sugar and added a few pinches of cinnamon, nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla. In assembling this, I first added the fruit and then topped with the batter. The sugar on top gave it a nice crunch. Mine was ready between 40-45 minutes, so I'd keep an eye on it (didn't want it too brown). So many possibilities using various fruits. Just had some warm with fresh whipped cream, and it was delicious!

This was excellent! One of the easiest fruit desserts I ever made and one of the best tasting.  We just bought a fresh box of blueberries (exactly two cups), and I wasn't up for the lengthy time it takes to make a blueberry pie from scratch. This cobbler recipe was the perfect solution! I made some changes to make it a bit healthier--I cut back butter to 2 1/2 tablespoons, for flour used equal parts white and whole wheat, cut back on sugar to 1/2 cup and used equal parts white and brown. I used the milk I had on hand, which was unsweetened almond milk. For the topping, instead of one tablespoon sugar, I mixed together two tablespoons of equal parts chopped pecans, oatmeal flakes, and brown sugar and sprinkled it on top of the berries. I baked it for 50 minutes, and the blueberries were bubbling and the cake was light brown. I served the first slice immediately, adding a sliver of butter and dusting of brown sugar, with a small scoop of vanilla (Hagan Daaz) ice cream. I immediately had a second piece, omitted the additional butter and sugar, and it was just as delicious. The ice cream really makes the cobbler feel like a more substantial dessert, very close to eating a crumbly pie. I recommend this to everyone who loves fruit desserts but doesn't have the time to make a pie!

nothing fancy- just a great easy quick treat.  my 12 year old son wants to make it himself next time- very doable.  we used fresh blackberries, star berries, and blueberries.  Great!  but I think frozen berries might be too mushy??  Will definitely make again and again.

Actually, I have this in the oven right now.  I'm very leary of the outcome since the butter seemed to come up over the batter and I wasn't sure what to do with it. I cut the amount of butter in half but still had my doubts.   Mix it in? Leave it with the batter sitting in the center? 
I mixed it in.  Don't know the outcome yet...to be continued.

As one of my favorite desserts, I've made cobblers for over 2 decades. Whilst living in Germany, discovered this recipe and it is now my go-to favorite.  I've made this recipe at least two dozen times and never had a problem.  I've used, peaches, blueberries, mixed berries (both fresh and frozen) and apricots.  I've served at large dinners as well as intimate family gatherings and it is always a hit!  My grown kids now ask for it when they come home for the holidays (as well as rice pudding) and it never fails as comfort-food the night before a big event!  Very easy to prepare.

The batter has no flavor and has as its purpose simply holding the blueberries.

The blueberries are OK but not sweet as I had hoped.

Nothing was juicy or delicious--I found this dish over-rated and nondescript.

Also, because nothing was said about the melted butter in the pan, I assumed the batter was poured on top of it.  I think that should have been clarified.

Delicious! I made this for my co-workers so I increased the recipe up to serve 20. I used fresh peaches grown here in beautiful central California, agricultural capital of the world! I added cinnamon, vanilla extract & almond extract. The consistency is definitely more like a very moist cake but the edges are buttery & crispy & absolutely the best part of this cobbler. If I had one of those "edges only" pans that would be perfect for this! Maximum golden goodness. This recipe just might inspire me to go out & purchase one simply because the edges are so darn good. Don't skimp on the butter! That's what makes it so delicious & golden. Also, I didn't bother peeling my peaches & it came out great! Saves time & mess just to leave the peel on. Great recipe!

Not quite like the kind of cobbler my parents made, but still a very tasty and super easy cobbler recipe. I made mine with apples, and I added some vanilla and apple pie seasoning to the batter before baking. Came out great.

I'm a cook, not a baker, and have a history of so-so desserts like this. THIS RECIPE has saved me! :) I was skeptical it could be so simple, and still be tasty. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! Even my hubby, who bears my attempts with patience,  ate it again for breakfast the day after we had it.  I used almond milk instead of regular, just because that's what I had the most of. I also used about 2 Tbsp. of sugar mixed into the fruit instead of sprinkled on top, as I knew my berries weren't very sweet to begin with. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested adding vanilla to the batter as I did and it was perfect.

This far surpassed my expectations. SO easy and super tasty."..We used freshly picked high bush blueberries and my 8 year old baking buddy agrees with the 5 star rating. We used skim milk to reduce fat and it still turned out great! Definitely a keeper.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. We went berry picking and so the abundance of fruits prompted me to search for a recipe that's quick and easy to whip up. My son said he didn't even notice I was preparing something so special in the kitchen as the preparation was so fast. And quite delicious, too. I had to make another one for the hubby as the kids and I finished it off in one sitting, lol. Thanks for sharing!

Easiest dessert recipe ever! This is exactly what a fruit cobbler should taste and look like - soft, cake like batter with browned edges that bakes up around the fruit. Only change I make is to reduce butter to 3TBL and add 1/2 t vanilla to the batter. I've used just about every fruit - frozen and fresh - out there and it always turns out perfectly. I always have a bag or two of frozen berries so I'm always prepared to make a last minute dessert.

Delicious! Easy! Quick! I recommend this to anyone needing a dessert in a pinch. Made it after dinner tonight and my husband & I love it! We used a frozen fruit mixture of strawberries, Mandarin oranges, and peaches. We also substituted olive oil for the butter. We put the olive oil in the oven to warm it up and then poured the batter into that. To quote my husband,"It's real good!"

I made the recipe as is but I added the following: about 2 1/2-3 Cups Fresh picked blackberries, about a 1/3 Cup Oatmeal, a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. And I used premium whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. :-) This turned out to be the BEST cobbler I have ever made! Couldn't resist putting a dollop of Tillamook Vanilla Bean ice cream on top of it. I highly recommend having a small bowl fresh from the oven! :-)

Easy and  delicious!   I read  the  other  reviews and  increased the  fresh  blueberries  to 3 1/2 cups.  It  was  amazing!  I might have left in the  oven  a bit too long.  The  corners  were  a bit  crunchy.  Not  burnt,  but just a little  crunchy.  My blueberries  were a tad sour  so I increased the  sugar  at the  end to 2 tablespoons.  I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe exactly, with the only change of baking it for an extra 10 minutes and it turned out soupy and a little greasy.  But it still tasted good - butter, sugar, flour, milk, fruit - what's not to like??  I thought it was weird to pour the batter into the melted butter.  The butter just pooled up along the edges and I wasn't sure what to do, so I ended up stirring it in the pan till it blended.  The edges cooked OK, but the middle was mushy and didn't cook properly.  I cooked it for 10 minutes longer than the max time suggested, but it was still mushy.  I would've cooked it longer but the edges were starting to burn.

Very good as written. It turned out very thin for me in an 8x8 glass baking dish. Even still, it was fantastic right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

This is a great cobbler. I finally found one that my husband likes. Mine didn't have a crunch crust. It tasted similar to a cake batter. I also doubled or tripled my berries. I will make this again for sure!

I used a full pound container of strawberries, and I wouldn't want to make it with less than that. Overall, this was pretty good. I wish I had started it earlier since it takes a long time to bake.

Make twice as much as you think you will need and there still won't be any leftovers. Made it with fresh strawberries and served with vanilla ice cream.  And I am embarrassed to say that it was so good I made it two days in a row!

This recipe is so simple that it's hard to be believe it's so good! Like crazy delicious! I've used this now with raspberries and also with blackberries and strawberries and it's always been great! I even skip the butter & used vegan margarine and water in place of the milk. Still delicious! You can't mess it up! Everybody should give this recipe a try.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!  I made a double batch using frozen peaches and blueberries.  Baked it in a cast iron skillet....FABULOUS crust and easy to make.  Rave reviews...this is a keeper.  Served with vanilla ice cream. Wish I could post a picture.

I just made this tonight, and it's a keeper! I used frozen mixed berries, 2.5 cups, did not thaw or rinse, just put them right on top as the recipe instructs. Baked for 55 min. It came out perfectly, and definitely company worthy with some whipped cream or ice cream!

Super easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe using frozen blueberries and bing cherries and added a dash of nutmeg.   Served it at room temperature with Cool Whip and vanilla bean ice cream.  This dessert was a big hit.

Easy, yes, but too sweet and too buttery for me. I even reduced the sugar to  1 cup, for a double batch, which was 1/3 less than called for.  I made this with 8 cups of frozen peaches (remember... double batch) and I added cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice (didn't measure, just shook it in). Even so, this dish lacked a complexity that my palate would have favored. Perhaps oats in the batter, more spices, a bit of vanilla, maybe a pinch of lavender would have made it more interesting. I did use 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt and reduced the milk to 1 cup, which turned out fine.  The batter and the method were successful, other than my preference for something less sugary/buttery.

This is REALLY good and so easy to make! I made it exactly as the recipe states. I made it with strawberries because we had way too many from the farmer's market but I just bought some peaches so we can also try it with those too.

DELISH!!!  So easy and so good!  Took the previous posters advice and added some vanilla to the mix.  Used a bunch of fruit that was about to turn from the fridge (blueberries, peaches, nectarines, plums and an apple). Sprinkled some brown sugar over the top and viola!  Instant yum!!! Hubby says this is a definite "do again"!!!!

I made this with fresh blueberries and it was all eaten the same day! I added a tsp of vanilla and then when cooled, drizzled a little icing sugar/lemon frosting over the top.

I am sorry to say I didn't care for this and I am not super picky.  I used three cups of blueberries.  Fresh out of the oven it was okay (although too sweet, which is a lot coming from me, lol).  But it soon turned very greasy, gummy and sticky.  I had even cut back to 3 tablespoons of butter and it still tasted basically like butter and sugar.

I would also agree that it was nothing like a cobbler; more like a greasy blueberry cake.

I must have done something wrong because I didn't think this was all that great.  Maybe I didn't let it bake quite long enough and I definitely think it needs more than 2 cups of fruit--at least 2.5 cups.  Having said that, for as easy as it was to throw together,  I will be making this again and try to tweak it a bit.

I made a blueberry and peach version with a cup of each.  It looks wonderful--crispy, sweet goodness but we won't try it until tomorrow at Ravinia.  I am sure it will be a hit!  So easy.  Love!

Wonderful and easy too! Melted just two tablespoons of butter, otherwise followed the directions. Made with fresh peaches, skin on, and topped with cool whip. Delish! Can see using any fruit with this recipe. Will keep in my favorites file!

I love this recipe. It is so easy and it is really good. I have a nectarine tree and am making another cobbler with this recipe. This is going to be my go to recipe for cobblers, it is the easiest recipe I have made with easy clean up.

SO easy for a non-baker like me! Tried blueberry the first time and blackberry the second time. Yum!  Will try doubling the recipe, but don't like doughy cobbler, so hoping it turns out as beautiful as before. Five stars for easy prep and great taste! Thanks for sharing!

This was so good and easy. I've had other cobblers that were kind of dry but this one is moist and delicious even though the 40 minutes of baking made it a little darker brown. Next time I'll try baking for less time. I used nectarines, plums, blueberries, and raspberries for the fruit. Yummy!

Good and simple.  Doubled the recipe without any adjustments to original recipe.  Used a 9 x 13, half peach, half berry.  Prepared it early in the day but heated it in a warm oven before serving with vanilla ice cream.  I think it would benefit with some finely chopped nuts sprinkled on top before baking.

So EASY and so delicious.  I used fresh cherries that were a little on the sour side.  Rather than sprinkling the sugar on top, next time i will mix it in (plus a little extra to make up for their tartness) and let the sugar soak in a little bit.

Was super easy to make. I used fresh Nectarines (3 of them) and served warm topped with whipped cream. My hubby said it was very good several times between mouthfuls. If I can get more than one good from him, this means its FANTASTIC! He liked that the cobbler was a bit chewy in consistency too.

Boy was this good!  This will be our go to cobbler for now on!  I used strawberries and blueberries.  I doubled the recipe which worked great, used a 9x13 dish.  I did add a little cinnamon to the sugar sprinkled on top.  Yummy!  Definitely serve this with ice cream!

I made this twice, both times using freshly-picked strawberries. Once as indicated, and once adding the 1 tsp vanilla and 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. On top of that one, my three-year-old begged me to put about 1/2 cup chocolate chips on top. Both ways were VERY good- the chocolate one tasted absolutely sinful!

NO!!! Don't sacrifice taste and consistency for the sake of time! I tried this cobbler and was not pleased at all. It is greasy and flat.  Previously, I made an absolutely fantastic cobbler with 'Emily's Blackberry Cobbler', and I highly suggest that recipe over this one.  The time is slightly longer to prepare with Emily's, but the results are a hundred times better.  We almost could not eat this Easy Batter cobbler... no good.

Made this recipe tonight and it was delicious and so easy!  I made substitutions to make it gluten and dairy free for our family and really wasn't expecting anything grand, but it turned out great!  Here are the changes I made: 2T coconut oil in place of butter, 1 cup trader joes gluten free all purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and coconut milk in place of the dairy. Just used a tj's bag of organic frozen berries for the fruit.  I have been looking for a good cobbler recipe ever since we went gluten free and I think I've found it!  Can't wait to try this with peaches! Yum!

This recipe has been a hit every time I have served it.  I have made it without melting the butter in the pan, and melting it.  Both ways are good.  I've tried lots of different mixtures, bananas and chocolate chips, peaches, strawberries and blueberries, or just peach and blueberries.  It is an easy cake that I can whip up for guests when I do not have a lot of time. I have used fresh fruit, canned fruit, and frozen fruit. I always add a little vanilla extract to it.  I double the recipe and put it in a 9X13 pan.  Oh and I just add fruit until it looks full. Definitely recommend this recipe!

5 stars for speed. I made this up as a last-minute dessert for company, and it took maybe 5 minutes to prepare. I'd say it was supposed to serve 6, but our guests went back for seconds and thirds and it didn't survive the hour.

OMG, this is good!  I have been cooking/baking for over 50 years and this is the best cobbler I have done.  I did use a square deep dish 9" pan so that my extra fruit did not overflow the pan.  A combination of VERY ripe peaches and tangy blueberries made for a delightful, easy dessert.  It definitely is a "keeper".

I love how quick and easy this recipe is to prepare! It's delicious with any type of fruit too. I have started reducing the butter to 3tblsp and the sugar to 1/2 cup. This is the only cobbler recipe I use now.

this recipe is amazing. i cant count how many times i have made this in the last month. FYI if you choose to use apples put them in with the melted butter they cook much better. and i let mine cook for 60min with the apples. i have tried all types of fruit with this. you cant go wrong. this is amazing!

Very easy recipe to put together, and it comes out wonderfully! The changes I made were to increase the flour and milk to 1 cup, change the sugar to 1/2 c white and 1/4 c packed brown sugar, use 1 1/3 t baking powder and add cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. I also increased the fruit to 3 1/2 c (I used sliced peaches and strawberries, yum!). Just before going into the oven, I sprinkled a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar over the top.

FANTASTIC! I just made it with all the blackberries I picked from around my house and it was perfect! I followed the recipe as written, but didn't measure out the berries...I just used what I had picked today and I added a little more flour because I think I had a little over two cups of berries. It was tasty and easy! A definite keeper!

It really couldn't get much easier than this.  I used 3 cups of sliced fresh very ripe peaches, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as suggested by other reviewers.  The batter didn't really rise much during baking, I think my baking powder is too old and has lost its leavening power.  Baked it for about 55 minutes and it really could have baked longer, it was somewhat doughy.  I used a stoneware pan, so I'm thinking it may have slowed down the initial cooking.  However, all of that said, it was REALLY good and between 4 of us, we managed to polish off 13 of the 16 pieces in the 8 x 8 pan.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll use fresh baking powder and I'll also bake it a bit longer.  Thanks for a simple but great recipe.

Pretty yummy and easy. I made it with 2 peaches, a  handful of blueberries, and a big handful of strawberries, sliced. I might not waste the strawberries next time. I'd also cut back on the sugar (try 1/2 cup not 3/4), add oats, flax, maybe wheatgerm? I also used the fancy big swedish sugar crystals on top, but they disappeared into the bubbling mixture while baking.

This cobbler was delicious, and so easy.  My husband is from the South and is picky about cobblers, but he loved this one.  I think a step should be added to the instructions, though.  After pouring the batter into the melted butter, I stirred the batter and butter together thoroughly before putting the fruit on top.  The instructions don't specifically say to do this, but it didn't seem right to me to leave them unmixed, and my results were perfect.  I wonder if some people did not mix them and if that was why the flour and butter proportions seemed off, as mentioned in a couple other reviews.  I used extra fruit (3 cups total:  1 cup peaches, 1 cup blueberries, and 1 cup nectarines) but otherwise did not make any other changes. I can't wait to make this again.

I have made my cobblers using this recipe for more years than I can count. The only difference is that I use at least 4 cups of fruit and cook it with about 3/4 cup of sugar before pouring it onto the batter. The cobblers are always delicious and always welcomed! I use peaches, blueberries, apples, whatever I happen to have on hand. Great recipe!!

I was concerned initially about some of the bad reviews.  Like how these could turn out mushy in the middle.  I think I tried Paula D's recipe, and it did just that and this one is very similar.  However, it came out just fine.  There was room for error...I used frozen mango that were not as sweet as I had hoped for so I added the entire amount of sugar to the fruit and let it sit while I fixed everything else.  After I finished, I became concerned that the dough portion would not be sweet enough, but it was fine with the fruit.  I don't think a recipe could be easier, and with some ice cream, this will be delightful.

Not quite what it could be with these tweaks: I used yogurt for part of the milk required...for most, actually. And I used 3 cups fruit, and added a goodly splash of vanilla. It was well received served hot with some low sugar vanilla ice cream. Yum. Note, though, it is cake-like more than crunchy.  I have made it as published and with these tweaks. Prefer the tweaked.

This is the best cobbler recipe and soooo good! We go blueberry picking every year and love to use fresh blueberries for this cobbler. But it's also good with frozen fruit as well! Very simple too.

I made the recipe exactly as it said. I used thawed blueberries for the fruit. The fruit all sunk to the bottom, and it wasn't quite as tasty as I thought it would be.  Still decent though.

I have made this recipe multiple times with a variety of different fruits including peaches, blueberries, and blackberries. It is only OK. I wouldn't rave about it and I'm not sure why it's rated so highly except that maybe it's extremely easy to make. I have had much better cobblers. This turns out very cake like and fairly dry. If you pull it out early, it's way too mushy.. so you can't really combat the dryness unless you're altering the recipe.

This turned out great. I did make a few changes to increase the fiber content. Instead of 3/4 c white flour, I mixed white flour with wheat flour, rolled oats and oat bran for a total of 1c. I also increased the sugar and milk to 1 c. I was a little worried because the batter was very runny, but it turned out just fine.

Quick and easy cobbler.  I made with peaches and blueberries and served with vanilla bean ice cream.  I want to try again with a multiple of different fruits.
This is best when served warm.  Leftovers were good, just not a good as the first servings.

This was great. I doubled this one but left the sugar at only 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. Additionally instead of just putting in blueberries I first cooked (for about 10 min on the stove top) 4 cups of blueberries in 1tbsp. white sugar, 1 tbsp. of honey, 1 tsp. fresh basil, and 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar; strained them - keeping the liquid to drizzle over the top once the cobbler was done. Additionally, I found that only using 2 tbsp. of butter for the entire dish was more than enough to prepare the 9x13 pan. I did bump up the baking powder to 1 tbsp. and added 2 tbsp. unsweetened applesauce (only since I cut back on the butter). This is such a keeper thxs for posting this one :-)

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I can whip this up so easily and quickly, and I usually have all the ingredients in the house.  I've been using blackberries in it, but am looking forward to trying fresh peaches when they're in season.  I like to pour a little bit of heavy cream (a few tablespoons at most) over the warmed cobbler.  This is how my family did it when I was a kid, and I love it that way!

Easy and very good.  Cobbler was not as cakey as I prefer, but this was so easy to make it is worth the trade-off.  Try with a bit less sugar if your fruit is naturally sweet.  Served with whipped cream and the family devoured it.

Made a gluten-free version using a combination of soy and rice flour, about 1/2 C. soy flour and 1/4 C. rice flour.  Used fresh blueberries.  Everyone had seconds and no one even realized they were eating a gluten-free version!

I've made this cobbler so many times I've lost count. I usually double it and make it in a big pan that's a few inches deep (13 inch) and put in a whole lot more fruit than it usually calls for too. Works perfectly, just cook it longer! It does make it gooier but I like that, personally. Even following the directions, though, this is not a crusty, dry cobbler! Very gooey and succulent. Very buttery, too, but I'll admit that I LOVE that about this dish!

I've made it as a single-fruit cobbler (strawberries, YUM) but mostly as a medley with a mix of berries, mandarin oranges (with the juice poured in) bananas and sometimes apples or peaches. It's always great and always works out, just make sure your fruits are fresh and JUICY (or that you add juice, like I do with the mandarin oranges).

This was very good! I used blueberry and raspberry - 50 minutes was a bit long for these berries and they ended up quite mushy, but the flavor was absolutely wonderful .. next time I'll try cooking for more like 40 mins & see how the berries fare. I didn't have baking power after knocking mine into the sink (drat!), so I used self-rising flour with no ill effects - just remember to leave out the salt as well as the baking power if you make this substitute as self-rising flour has both added in. Thanks for sharing!

Very simple, easy dessert.  I've made it twice, both times with peaches.  The second time I reduced the butter and sugar and it was still great.  Will definitely be making again.

I had some leftover netarines that were getting a little overripe so I decided to do a basic cobbler with them. I used this recipe and it turned out great. I just added a little cinnamon to the flour mixture, and tossed the nectarines in some sugar instead of sprinkling it on top. The batter did turn out to be a little chewy, but I think I baked it too long. My oven gets a little hotter than it's supposed to!

Easy is right!  This went into the oven 10 minutes after I began prep - and that included slicing up my fresh peaches.  Next time I will adjust the sugar accordingly for the fruit.  For peaches, this was too sweet, but for, say, raspberries, the amount of sugar may be appropriate.  Sweetness aside, this smelled fantastic while baking and no one in the house had any complaints about it.  It didn't win me over to the "cobbler side" (I'm a crisp lady myself), but it is a very good for when my fam wants something different.

This is ridiculously easy but makes you look like a talented baker, and it is unbelievably yummy! This will be my go-to dessert from now on.  It’s not too heavy, and it tastes like summertime. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, and it is even better. Can’t beat this recipe!

This is an excellent easy recipe. I've used it for over a year now, with fresh or frozen berries, and even some blueberries that thawed too long in the fridge and had to be cooked. I just drained most of the liquid out of them and sprinkled them with sugar before tossing into the recipe. WOW. This cobbler is SO easy, and I've never made a bad one yet.  I can't believe anyone would give it less than 5 stars. With a scoop of ice cream, it's the perfect, easy dessert for company when the rest of your menu requires lots of attention and you still want dessert to be special.

I tried this recipe and it turned out great! I did double the batch and made it in a 9x13 baking dish. I used 1 can lite peaches and 2 cups frozen mixed berries(that is what I had available I wanted to used some rhubarb but had run out), and I did try the couple suggestions from others such as 1/2 tsp vanilla(Imixed that in the fruit) and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg(Imixed that in the dry mix before adding the milk).  This was quick, easy to follow simple and delicious and it got rave reviews from those who had dessert with us, most took 2nd helpings and the ones who didn't have to watch their sugar in take :) Thanks for sharing this :)

I really love how easy and tasty this recipe is.  I've made it several times and have tweaked it just a bit to work for me a bit better. I'd definitely recommend using a little extra fruit, although it works great with a minimal amount too.  I've also accidentally left out half the sugar and it still ended up being plenty sweet for me.  Lovely, simple recipe!

This was the dessert for last night's Sunday Family Dinner!! 

We "healthy-fied" it because, that's what we do sometimes! Used 4 cups of chopped up, fresh nectarines (skin on), over ripe fresh strawberries and frozen blue berries.

Substitutes (all measurements remained the same):
whole wheat flour instead of a/p flour
evaporated milk instead of reg milk (none in the fridge)
splenda instead of white sugar

This came out sooo yum!! The crust was more of an actual crust (kinda flat, not cake-y at all)

We loved it!!

My 2nd try, I used only half the amount of butter in the dish and that made it even BETTER!!!  Easy and very tasty!

Delicious!  Doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan as recommended by another review.  Made with fresh nectarines and added almond extract & cinnamon to the batter.  Everyone was exuberant about it, especially with a little vanilla ice cream on top!

OMG a great, fast dessert.  Added a splash of vanilla and sprinkled a little cinnamon-sugar on the top.  Added a little more fruit, used blueberries and raspberries and made in a  deep dish pie plate.  It only served 4 so next time will double and make in a 9 x 13.  It seems awfully simple but try it, you won't be disappointed.

I went blueberry picking with my family and brougt home tons of blueberries. i've been looking for more things to bake with them and i found this recipe. Because of all its good reviews, i decided to try it out. I took the advice of my fellow bakers when they said 3tpsb of butter was enough and to add 3 cups of fruit. well, because i added an extra cup of fruit, i couldnt even taste the cobler! the whole thing just came out tasting like over sweetned, buttery blueberries with a crust on the side. Way too much butter in this, even after taking out a tspb. Guess recipes that take 10 minutes to trhow together, dont taste  good after all.

I made this with fresh blueberries with a few peaches thrown in to make a full 2 cups and it was very good. I couldn''t believe how easy it was. The texture is a little chewy around the edges, which I liked. I think a little more fruit and some cinnamon would really have made it 5 stars. This is a true cobbler, which should be easy to make and was.

I followed the recipe exactly, using 1 cup of blueberries and 1 cup of strawberries (diced to the size of the blueberries). Though it tastes delicious, it doesn't LOOK very good. I will experement with using more batter next time!

5 stars for ease of making and yummy tasting. I stuck very closely to the recipe with the following changes: I baked mine in a cast iron skillet as I do not have a 8" square pan and the only round pan I have is either the cheesecake pan or the skillet. I chose the skillet. I used frozen blackberries and raspberries. They didn't "bubble" like the recipe said... the cobbler turned out more like sponge cake, which I didn't mind. But I was wondering if that turned out right or it's something to do with my flour...

Great recipe! I used some apples that were about to go bad that I diced. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon (we like a lot of cinnamon) and grated nutmeg to the batter, you can add cloves, ginger, cardamom. I also sprinkled some sultanas that I'd soaked in boiling water to puff up. And I sprinkled brown sugar instead of white in the end. Perfect recipe, done in literally minutes!!! Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe and it couldn't have been easier. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries and baked it for exactly 50 minutes. Perfection! The only thing I did was to stir the butter into the batter a bit before topping with the berries and sugar. Don't know if it made a difference, but the cobbler was fantastic! It baked completely (no doughy center) and was not overly browned on the edges! Thanks for the recipe!!

I switched out milk for almond milk, added almond extract, cut the butter in half- used soy butter instead.  Was perfect!  anymore butter would have been way too much, and I made it Vegan!

I just made this and it is fantastic! I cleaned out my fridge and used leftover raspberries, blueberries and blackberries - 2 cups worth. I followed the instructions and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg plus a handful of slivered almonds. Easy to make, great tasting and not too sweet. A keeper!

We absolutely love this recipe. I use a little less butter and substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. I don't measure the fruit, just dump it in until it looks "good". It is wonderful with all sorts of fruits that bake well; I have used apple and cinnamon, frozen cherries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, a combination of any frozen berries, fresh peaches, apples and pears... we love them all!

I did mine with a combination of strawberries and blueberries. I was worried that this wouldn't be sweet enough since neither fruit is in season. I was so wrong! My cobbler had the perfect balance of tart and sweet. Also, vanilla ice cream on top is a must!

Awesome recipe!  What else could you ask for: easy to prepare, tastes wonderful and a few ingredients.  My kind of recipe.  Used 3 Tablespoons of butter instead of 4.  It never lasts more than 5 minutes out of the oven, so I can't comment on people who say it tastes mushy the next morning.  Truly one of our favorite recipes.  Used frozen cherries from Costco as well as frozen berries.

YUM! The first bite I took while it was still really hot was just so-so, but then I took another, and another! My husband then said he couldn't stop going back for more! I made it with frozen blueberries this time. I will try this again and again with other fruits.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I always pop it in the oven while my guests and I are eating dinner and it is ready to go by dessert time.  Works well with peaches, strawberries, rasberries, apples, or blackberries.  Served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream is the best!

Truly nothing special.  I mean, it might be your cup of tea, but I prefer something with a bit more flavor and texture.  Mine tasted like a lump of bland processed flour.

This was fantastic!  It was so quick, easy, and the most delicious cobbler I ever had. A bold statement for how easy this was... I know.  I had 2 nectarines that were ripe and needed to be eaten so I halved this recipe in a smaller baking dish.  I will never let fresh fruit go to waste ever again.  I can't wait to try this with a different fruit.

Followed this recipe to a T. For a quick and easy dessert this worked. Personally not a wow recipe or something I'd make for company. I used fresh blueberries so if I ever make again, I'll probably use frozen and save the fresh fruit for something really spectacular.

I love how easy this was, and it tasted pretty good too! (Topping the cobbler with vanilla ice cream is definitely highly recommended.) I used mostly blueberries with a few strawberries, and I think next time I will try peaches for a little more sweetness.

This recipe is a hit at my house!  I used nectarines and peaches the first time, and when my son asked if I could make it again a couple of days later, I had peaches and pears on hand, so just used them and that worked out fine too.

This was a great easy cobbler.  Even my husband loved it and he usually would rather his fruit be baked up in a pie crust.  Used fresh blueberries and fresh peaches, can't wait to try different variations!  The only changes I made was to add vanilla and cinnamon (1 teaspoon-beacuse we love it) to the batter and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  Awesome with some vanilla ice cream!

Very disappointing. I will pay closer attention to the photos next time . The one posted by USA WEEKEND gives the appearance of a a flakey crust with moist fruit . instead the crust was chewy dough. and the fruit was dry.I don't think I would waste a good scoop of ice cream on top of this "clobbler"...

This was so quick and easy!  It was also pretty tasty, though not as good as "traditional" cobbler.  I'll make it again if I have fresh fruit lying around that I can't eat before it spoils!

This was really easy and delicious.  Had some fresh peaches that ended up with a lot of bruises and needed to do something to use some of them up.  It ended up a little dark around the edges, but I blame the dark nonstick metal pan I used.  Next time I will use a glass baking dish and probably add at least a half cup more fruit.

I followed the recipe as written and it is very easy. I added some cinnamon on top before baking and it took longer to bake than the stated time. It never seemed to really bubble the way a cobbler should. (I checked the oven temp and it's accurate.) Overall, it tasted very bland. Not sure I'll be making this again.

I made this exactly as written, using 1 cup fresh peaches and 1 cup fresh blackberries from the farmers' market and we loved it. Super easy/fast to make. Served with vanilla ice cream (the only way to eat fruit cobbler in my opinion :) )

This was excellent! My mom and cousin make another version of this (different recipe from this site) and I bought 5 lbs of peaches and needed to do something with them. So I made this! The batter turned out just right! The only change I made was using probably 1/2C of evaporated milk and then 1/4C milk since I didn't have enough milk. Came out perfectly though!

This was delicious.  Based on one of the reviews, I also used 3 T butter instead of 4.  Also did not use the full T of sugar to sprinkle on top.  Next time I think I will use a little less than the 3/4 c. sugar, as this cobbler was a little too sweet for me, but I still enjoyed it, especially warm with vanilla ice cream.

This may sound weird to some, but I'm not very familiar with cobblers at all. I tried one years back and thought it was OK... this one is great. It came together so quickly and EASILY too, I made with peaches and the fresh slices were done to perfection. The top was nice and crisp-chewy on the outside and edges, with the inside being warm and soft and fruity and delicious. I did need the full hour in my oven. A perfect dessert for last-minute company, thanks so much for sharing.

Very delicious.  I made it with peaches and added a little almond extract to the batter which gave it a nice added flavor. This is very easy, depending on what fruit you are using.  If you have to peel and core, it will naturally take a bit longer. I don't think this is the most beautiful or sophisticated dessert, but it is a great thing to whip up quickly or to use extra fruit.

Awesome--both easy-to-make (think of the simple recipes they used to use in home-ec) and yummy.  I even used some tasteless, tiny peaches from our tree (such a bad year that I was going to just let the birds have them) and they were still delish in this recipe, combined with fresh blueberries.  What a break!

I used peaches and strawberries. It was good, but I won't use peaches again. Something about the texture didn't seem right. Plus, the edges burned too fast while the center stayed too gooey.

Simple and delicious. I've made this with blueberries, raspberries, mullberries and peaches (separate dishes - not all together), and every version was delicious. It's especially wonderful served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Just the way it says except on gooseberries!! For 9x13 only double; triple is too much,doesn't get done. So far I have tried this on gooseberries (when adding sugar at end add 1/4 c sugar and 1 tbsp instant tapioca per 4 servings), blackberries, and mullberries all picked from our woods. This is definitely a crowd pleaser!! Had the gooseberry for a birthday party and my mother-in-law, who has never complimented my cooking in 7 years took half of it home!:)

This was fantastic and VERY easy! I used 4 cups of fresh berries; blueberries, blackberries and strawberries. I did add, as another reviewer suggested, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also think I would cut the sugar back next time..maybe a 1/3 to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4.

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  Based on other reviews, I reduced the butter to 3 TB and increased the fruit to 4 cups, using a combo of nectarines, blueberries and raspberries.  I ended up baking mine for about 70 minutes, probably because of the extra fruit, which I highly reccommend.  So yummy!!

I tend to favor fruit "crisps" to cobblers, but this recipe may make me change my mind... it was insanely easy to put together, even though I was using fresh strawberries and peachs so I had to prep them. Ease of Prep + Final Dish = FABULOUS. Loved it with a little fresh whipped cream... hits the spot! While it's not the prettiest dish ever, it didn't matter... it received rave reviews!  **Doubled fruit amounts and glad I did! Except I should've upped the batter a little bit... I wanted more of that too!

Easiest ever. I substituted white rice flour for the wheat to make it gluten free and it was awesome - my husband actually preferred it that way. I also added an additional cup of peeled ripe peaches to the blueberries and whipped up some homemade whipped cream. Fruity decadence!

Nice summer time dessert if you have good, fresh fruit.  I liked the batter a lot.

4 1/2 stars. Tasted good to my husband and myself, but not good enough to serve to company. I did use  a full can of peach filling. It was syrupy so I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup; the butter to 7 TBL; and the milk to 1/2 cup. Definitely need to cover half the time because the top is done WAY before the bottom. More dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe vanilla are needed. I will try again, I like using a whisk instead of the mixer. With tinkering, peach filling is doable and easier for my craving.

This is the easiest dessert recipe I've ever tried and tastes fantastic.  I prefer my desserts a bit less sweet so only use 1/3 cup sugar in the batter.  Very delicious!

I made this using strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. It was decent. It was easy, but something seems to be missing. I have tasted much better.

The easiest dessert when I am pressed for time. I usually have this baking while we are eating dinner and by the time we are done, it is ready to eat. Do not forget the icecream on the side!

All I can say about this recipe is WOW!!!!!  I'd give it more stars if possible.  I tried it with fresh strawberries.  I can't wait to try it with other fresh fruit this summer!  Oh, I didn't have any butter on hand so I used Land O' Lakes stick margarine...obviously it worked.  : )

Mmm.  I'm eating some right now still warm from the oven.  I used a 9x13 pan and used just 2 T. butter, 1-1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt, 1-1/2 c. milk, 4 c. fruit.  (I had black raspberries thawed and they were a little sweet on their own).  I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter and mixed the melted butter around in the batter before I topped with the fruit.  It was done in exactly 60 min.  The crust has a great texture of being a little crunchy/chewy and then softer inside.  This was a great way to use up all the raspberries I had thawed, and will be my "go to" recipe for using up fruit.

It’s my favorite cobbler recipe! The edges get all crispy from the melted butter and the batter gets cooked all the way through because it’s thin enough -not like a cake batter. So yum! Raspberry is our favorite.

Simply delicious!  I used skim milk and frozen mixed fruit (peaches, strawberries, pineapple, and mangoes) and it came out so great.  I'm going to try this with Splenda in place of the sugar next time so my husband can feel less apprehensive about eating this great dessert.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Used carton of strawberries and blueberries.... super good!  Added some cinnamon and a little ginger.  Used 1/2 splenda for baking and 1/2 sugar.  Recommend stirring together the butter and batter a little so it doesn't leave all the butter to the edges.  Still made a nice crunchy crust.. will make again!

Love this dessert.  I don't really bake and this was a cinch.  I made this for 2 families I was making dinner for and also for my family.  My daughter wasen't a fan, but she's only 4.  My other 2 kids, 5 and 2 ate it up.  Delish!!!  I'm making it again tonight.

This is the recipe for what the Menonites call Fruit Batter.  It is just missing 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. It really is not the best dessert but it is the easiest. And it tastes ok.  Good one to help teach little kids to cook.

I had never made a cobbler before and was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.  Easy and delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly because I didn't know enough about cobblers to stray.  Will definitely make again when peaches are in season!

Love this recipe! It's a great go-to cobbler recipe. I just throw in frozen fruit I have on hand. I've made it three times and it's been awesome every time. My husband said he would love the caky part even without the fruit. It's a must with vanilla ice cream!

Absolutely love this.  I use whole wheat flour, and  make it a little thicker as well, using a little more flour.  I add a little cinnamon, too.  I have made this three times so far, using a combo of blackberries and blueberries (I use more fruit than the recipe calls for).  Has turned out great every time.  Looking forward to peach season.

WOW!!!  I was craving a dessert with berries, and this recipe was delicious!  I used 3 tablespoons of butter (instead of 4) and doubled the recipe.  I'm glad that I doubled it because when it was done baking, it filled an 8-inch square baking dish perfectly.  I used blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries.  My husband and I enjoyed a piece a few minutes after it came out of the oven--while it was still warm.  Super tasty!

This recipe really amazed me. After reading the ingredient list and directions, I was expecting a simple tasting family dessert with adequate texture, but nothing more. We were delighted when the cobbler emerged from the oven as an attractive and delicious dessert. The berry filling was perfectly gooey (not runny or dry). The batter had risen to the top to form a crunchy topping. The taste, while not flashy, was quite satisfying. I rated this recipe 5 stars since the small effort created a dish that was well worth the time and ingredients. There may be better cobbler recipes available, but this recipe did not fail to impress this amateur cook. As a side note, I used a frozen berry mix that had melted and refrozen into a block of berries and had planned to toss them since I couldn't separate the mess. This recipe saved me from being wasteful, in addition to creating a wonderfully tasty experience.

So good but make sure you mix the batter well of it will turn out lumpy like mine once did. Otherwise, it's crusty cake on the outside and moist inside with fruit fillings.

Definitely the cakey type of cobbler, which I enjoy. I don't understand the butter either - 4tbl in a 9" round seems excessive.  I have made this once with 2tbl butter, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour + 1/2 all purpose white flour, and the 2 cups of peaches I sliced and froze a few months ago that hadn't quite defrosted (I was in a hurry) and had quite a bit of frozen juice around each piece.  After 1 hr it still looked a little doughy in the middle so I changed my oven to convection, lowered to 325, and baked it for another 10 min. the edges were pretty brown and crunchy but not burned and the middle was cooked all the way. It isn't super sweet on it's own, which is fine for some people (ie, me), but my family liked it better with whipped cream.

This was good, but it's way too tart if you just use raspberries like I did.  I think it needs an extra bit of sugar in the batter and on the raspberries or fruit. If I make this again, I'll use more sugar.

Wow!  This was so good!  I made it vegan by using Earth Balance and homemade almond milk.  I doubled and baked in 9x13.  Next time I won't double butter or sugar used as topping.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I used black raspberries for my fruit, 3 tbl of butter, and added about 1 tsp vanilla.   A beautiful and simple dessert - next time I make it I'll probably bake in a cast iron pan in the oven; that would look fantastic!

This was a good cobbler recipe.  The fruit sunk to the bottom, but it was not very pretty.  It was also too gooey for my taste.  I will use it if I am in a hurry.

Thought this was really good.  Made with apples and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  My only complaint is I cooked it for 70 mins, but the inside was somewhat mushy (and I made it with apples which aren't particularly juicy).  Any suggestions   Still delicious overall though.

Super super easy and delicious! Used 3 tbsp of butter instead.  Strawberries and blueberries, what a match!

very quick easy recipe.  Ingredients are basics in any kitchen. Made it with frozen raspberries from garden.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness for this.  Fantastic!

I enjoyed the ease of this dessert.  I think the longest part was peeling the peaches - everything else was a snap.  I think next time I make it I will add some cinnamon and brown sugar but this recipe is one to keep.

A delicious cake-like, batter with a sweet, sugary, crunchy top - YUM!    Also very easy to put together.   I used rhubarb.

Yummy. Followed directions exactly but added more like 3 cups of fruit (2 cups of fresh thin sliced peaches & 1 cup frozen raspberries). Sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of white. Baked for about 70 minutes to really brown up the cobbler. My kids and husband loved this.

This was the first cobbler I've ever made and it was absolutely delicious!  I had some fresh blueberries that I had bought a week or two ago and they were getting pretty soft.  So I found this recipe.  I was having friends over last night to play Beatles Rock Band so I made the batter before they arrived and had it saran wrapped in the fridge.  I had dinner in the oven.  As soon as I pulled dinner out of the oven  I melted the butter for the cobbler, assembled, and put it back in the oven.  Since the batter was already prepared, after the butter melted, it took less than a minute to assemble.  I LOVE recipes like this.  You can focus on entertaining and not have to worry about being in the kitchen the whole time your guests are over.  So enough about the simplicity!  The texture and flavor were incredible!  I was a little concerned because the blueberries I had were pretty tart.  However, the cobbler was perfectly sweet!  I took it out of the oven and set it out with some bowls.  Once it was dipped into, it was gone quickly.    I still have some blueberries left, so I'm definitely making this again tomorrow night.  YUM!

This is such an easy and mistake free recipe. Totally fool proof.It is just delish!!! I will make it again and again. It looks funny when you add the fruit to the batter but trust me it will turn out great!

Excellent!! Easy!! I cooked it a little longer and added some vanilla. Got crispier and better with the longer cooking time. I used fresh blueberries and frozen strawberries. What more can I say!

i had some frozen strawberries i wanted to use and saw this recipe. i was unsure at first but i figured it was easy with not many ingredients so i tried it. i read up on some otter cobbler and so i used 1c flour, 2tsp baking soda. i was worried about the berries being to wet, but i baked it anyways. i was surprised how good it looked coming out of the oven. next time i will watch it bc my outer crust was really hard, but overall it was really good. the berries were kinda gooey, but i didnt know if it was bc they were frozen. i will make this again but with fresh fruit and maybe double the crust, thx

I found this recipe a couple of days ago and  don't know how I had never seen it before. In just under an hour you can have this lovely, summery dessert on the table. I had a hard time waiting for it to cool off. I confess to adding more than the called for amount of fruit; 2 cups. 2 peaches, 1 plum, a handful of frozen strawberries and as many blueberries as was needed to fill in the gaps. This combination was pretty good. The blueberries stuck out as the best tasting fruit.

I used 4 large fresh peaches (skins removed) sliced thin, mixed with a teaspoon of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of sugar and let them sit for a few minutes before adding to the batter. I also added vanilla to the batter. Best cobbler I have ever had by far. Thank you for the recipe.

This is so awsome!  I sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting in the oven.  I used all blueberries.  You can use just about any fruit.  Next time I will try apples.  Mine took the full 60 min.  The best...Yum!!

I was so glad to find this recipe.  My grandmother used to make this when I was little.  It's almost as good as hers (not much can be as good as how grandma made it, right?) I've made with just peaches, peaches and blackberries, and peaches and blueberries.  Great warm, great as leftovers.  A definite keeper!

We went blueberry picking and had a ton of fresh blueberries to use, so I tried this recipe. I doubled the recipe and cooked in a round casserole dish. It looked a litte soupy going into the oven, but turned out awesome. Everyone is already asking to make this again.

This is such a versatile batter and works well with just about any fruit. My family absolutely loves it! The best part is that it is so incredibly easy.  Edited to add: cut down on the baking time by microwaving for 5 minutes, then baking in the oven for 30 minutes. The crust seems to fluff up a bit more by doing this.

A Great easy dessert. I just changed a few things, 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar. I used 3 cups blueberries, 1/2 tsp vanilla, dash of nutmeg and instead of just sugar on top I used cinnamon sugar. My hubby loved it and I can't wait to try it again.

This was very easy to make and yielded a pretty good dessert.  I like biscuit-y cobblers best, but this was very good for a cake-y cobbler. I reduced the butter, added a dash of vanilla to the batter, used fresh blueberries and canned peaches to make 3 cups of fruit, and used brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping instead of white sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sooo good! Used homegrown peaches from a neighbor and served with vanilla ice cream one day, whipped cream another time...then, it was all gone. The peaches were very small and so were the pieces, but it seemed to distribute into every bite.  Very good.

This is so addicting!  I used 3T butter and 3.5 cups of fruit (strawberries and blueberries).  Yes it is kinda mushy in the middle, but to me it was kinda more like pudding and it may not have been so bad had the majority of the fruit end up there. It was still really good and I would make it again!

Crispy and golden brown on the edges and soft towards the center.  This cobbler consisted of 2 cups of cherries and 1 cup of blueberries for the fruit portion.  Enjoyed the taste and texture.  Not as sweet as other cobblers, but still good.  With this fruit combination, you may want to add some more sugar.  Thinking of trying this again with Splenda sprinkled on top instead of sugar.

Perfect, not gooey cobbler! I turned oven off at 45 minutes and let sit in the oven for 30 min, then cooled in the dish. The ensured the bottom was not doughy. I cheated and used a pie filling- next time fresh fruits will be great!

I made this with 2 heaping cups of nectarines and baked it in a 7" square Corning Ware casserole for 55 minutes. Yummy! It had a very dense, chewy, interestingly delicious "doughy" bottom and center. However, I could see why someone described it as "soggy". My husband exclaimed "Wow, what a great tasting dough!" The top edges had a crisp, buttery crunch. There is something almost strangely addicting about it. This would have more crisp top if baked in a larger, flatter dish.

I added a little vanilla to the batter and cinnamon to the fruit mix (peaches and raspberries), and it turned out fantastic. Super easy and tasty. Highly recommend.

This was just alright.  It wasn't the best cobbler I've made but for how simple it was, I'd make it again and again.  I did however take people's suggestions and added an egg to the batter as well as one teaspoon vanilla.  And I also sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Very quick and easy which I love.

Not the best cobbler. Here's what I did differently: 1. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon in addition to the sugar. 2. I doubled everything and baked it in a 9X13 pan. 3. SERVE WITH ICE CREAM. This is a must. Otherwise this cobbler would be "just okay."

This is a pretty decent dessert considering the amount of time that it took.  Next time, I will cut back the amount of sugar because it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a jelly roll pan.  I used 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries & 1/2 cup nectarice chunks & really liked that combo.  Oh, I also added in 1/8 tsp of vanilla for flavor.  After reading reviews, I wish I would have also added some sprinkled cinnamon on top, but can always remember to do it if I ever make the recipe again.  This is for sure not a flaky cobbler, but much more cakey.  Again, it is so easy to make & for such little work ita great "standby" recipe for a quick dessert.  :)

It's EASY and sweet, but the texture of the cobbler is kind of spongey. I used fresh strawberries, mango and a few bananas that needed to get gone.  We like a crumbly cobbler, so this won't be a repeat but its not awful and worth a try if you like easy, sweet and spongey.

This recipe lived up to its name it was super easy.  I was ready to do all this hard work but it was put together in less than 10 minutes.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect.

Good but mushy.  I think next time I will bake for 60-70 min at 450 because of the frozen fruits.  But it was very delicious, I made this with frozen strawberries and blackberries and used half the amt of sugar and replaced the rest with Splenda (6 single serving packets).  If there is a difference, I definitely didn't taste it.

this wasn't the best. it was really buttery and the texture was really spongy. i'll look for a flakier or more streusel-y cobbler. this was more like a undercooked berry cake-y mush

This is a very easy dessert to make so you can put it in before you eat dinner.  But with the price of berries so high, I guess I would've rather have had berry pie.

This is the cobbler recipe I have been searching for! I have tried nine other recipes from this site and all have been too cakey or just didn't taste like my great-granny's. I am very pleased also with the fact that I used a frozen triple berry blend (blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries) purchased from Sams Club and the end result was simply fabulous. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was just ok.  I followed the directions exactly as written using a 12 oz. bag frozen berries. The batter was the problem.  When it was being mixed, it just appeared too watery and runny.  Sure enough, when it finished baking, the batter baked up to be very thin, rubbery and tasteless.  I did use fat-free milk (maybe that was the problem?) and if I were to repeat the recipe I would use whole milk and maybe add an egg.  Pretty disappointed as I had hoped this would be really good. :(

I used half frozen blueberries and half jarred peaches.  Also, I made a crumb topping (1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon butter) and sprinkled it on before baking.  It melted on and made this pretty marbled design.  Tasted awesome!!

this recipe is wonderful.  it tastes great, is very easy to make, it is not too sweet, as you can tell i REALLY like this one.  i just did a little change by adding 1/2 cup of pl. yogurt and 1/4 cup skim milk in place of the 3/4 cup milk.  i used frozen peaches and frozen berries for the fruit. thank you so much for this recipe!

Everyone had second helpings!! I used the advice of other reviewers by adding nutmeg and vanilla. I also used fresh strawberries and brown sugar to top it at the end. I doubled the recipe since we are good eaters in this house and I'm glad I did. This is a keeper!

The flavor was really good!  I used 1 12 oz. frozen pkg of mixed berries as the recipe suggested.  I thought there was a little too much fruit verses cake.  I would actually increase the batter next time to 1 1/2 times for the amount of fruit I used.  Being that my fruit was frozen it turned out a bit mushy and I didn't like the seeds in the raspberries.. My bad though!.. Over all I think with the changes I said I would really like this!~

This is a lovely recipe and very easy for those who are intimidated by making desserts. You can make it look pretty or throw it all in the pan, your choice. I made this first time, exactly as the recipe said, and the second time I added some lemon zest to the batter and some vanilla sugar to the fruit. Also very pleasing with a small scoop of frozen yogurt or light coolwhip. You can cut back on the butter, I used half as much the second time, BUT it won't taste quite as rich and I won't reduce the butter again. Also, do not substitute the butter, my sister tried with margarine.....it wasn't anywhere near as tasty, or crisp on the edges. A keeper and a nice recipe to pass on.

Delicious!  I added lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter to give it an extra flavor boost.  I used one and a half 12 oz bags of frozen mixed berries to make it more fruity.  I may add a little cornstarch next time because it was a little runny when it came out of the oven, but had a marvelous taste and consistency once cooled.

THIS IS VERY GOOD!! All I did was add more fruit than the recipe called for and reduced sugar (only because I am trying to eat less sugar). It is NOT too "cakey" like some say. I had seconds. Easy to make.

Super easy!  I used smart balance instead of butter and it turned out fine.  I also added a dash of vanilla and used about 3 1/2 cups of fresh peaches... very good!

This recipe is so simple and deserves a five star rating.  I have used it with apples, peaches, and pears. My husband and I agree this is the best cobbler we have eaten! I was out of all purpose flour when I first tried the recipe, so I used bread flour.  The crust was so good I always use bread flour for our fruit cobbler.

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars, but it was so yummy I went for 5. Very easy to prepare. I used fresh peaches and blueberries and served it with ice cream. Not super pretty...but the taste makes up for it!

This was yummy.  I followed recipe exactly with the exception of a splash of vanilla and a couple of shakes of cinnamon.  I used a 28oz can of peaches because that's all I had on hand.  The topping was crunchy good and I served it with ice cream.  Very easy to prepare and endless possibilities when it comes to the type of fruit.

This isn't the tastiest cobbler I've had, but it was definitely the easiest! It was unbelievable how fast and easy this was.  This recipe does create a nice crust on top and around the edges, but I think it was more like a bread pudding w/ large chunks of fruit than a true cobbler. While mine did not turn out greasy, I do think the butter can be halved.  I made mine to fit a ceramic oval dish that's approx 9x13, so I sort of doubled the recipe to fit the dish.  I had at least 4 cups of freshly picked organic nectarines from my friend's garden, and I literally eyeballed the batter to fit b/c I wanted more fruit than batter.  I used whole wheat flour which usually requires more liquid than all-purpose flour, and it gave the cobbler a nutty taste which I really enjoyed.  Otherwise I think the batter might have needed more spice since it's really only flavored with butter and sugar.  Firm nectarines that are still tart are the best to use for baking, in my opinion.  They turn out perfectly sweet, tender, and flavorful.  Ripe nectarines tend to get way too soggy and syrupy sweet after baking, for my taste at least.

Delicious. Fast. Easy. Used less strawberries, and were frozen. Used only 1/2 cup of sugar. Will definitely make again, very tasty. Next time I will add some vanilla.

Good.  Easy.  Fast preparation.  I used Rice Dream for the milk and Earth Balance for the butter (only 2 T though.)  I added more fruit than called for (raspberries, peaches, and blueberries.)  It baked while we ate dinner and was served warm with ice cream for dessert.  A nice, easy, and tasty way to use up some fruit.

This recipe was so easy to make and it was a big hit with my family. I have made this recipe several times with different friut. One ingredient I will omit next time is the salt. With the butter having salt in it already I felt that it tasted to salty.

Absolutely delicious and so easy.  I used a combination of cherries, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.  On top I served a lemon glaze which made the fruit fresh and yummy.  I also used 3+ cups of fruit as suggested by other reviewers.

This was good. I used nectarines and added a little cinnamon to it just for family preference. I also cooked it in my slow cooker for about 2 hours or so ( I wasn't really paying attention) It turned out really well. I would make this again.

Great recipe, I would definitely make again! I used strawberries and blueberries, and like other people suggested I only used 2 tablespoons of butter & 2.5 cups of fruit. I topped it with whipped topping and it was a hit! It also stayed moist enough that I could re-heat the left overs and not worry about it drying out.

Ironically, I don't even like fruit desserts (I usually only make chocolate desserts) but I loved this! 

The best part was how easy it was. It took me about 10 minutes from beginning to to getting it in the oven.  

Perhaps I will try cherries or peaches next time... Thanks!

I prefer a pastry type cobbler. This is more of a cake type cobbler. I made it with blackberries. It a bit gooey for my tastes. It was good with ice cream. Next time, I will stick to my pastry style cobbler.

Loved it!  We had picked a full basket of blueberries this morning and wanted to make something quick and easy and freeze the rest.  This was perfect!  I'm not what you would call a good "baker", but my husband and neighbors were blown away by this one!  It was so easy I made 3!  By the 3rd I cut the butter to 3tsp and added about another 3/4 of berries and lots of sugar on top.  Thanks so much!!

This is a good and simple recipe.  It is very good.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the leftovers weren't eaten within 24 hours, which is the measurement of a 5 star dish.

This is very easy.  I added a bit more flour to the batter just bc it was so runny, and I added cinamon, vanilla, and nutmeg.  Also used half blueberries and half strawberries bc didn't have enough strawberries.  It's good and quick to put together and bf said, "this is just like pie".  I don't know about that, but it's good.  Thanks!

Great recipe. Super easy and a great way to use and showcase fresh, in-season fruit. I used fresh strawberries and blackberries, about 3 cups. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top. Next time I'll reduce the butter in half. Great with vanilla ice cream.

We have really been enjoying this recipe with local, fresh strawberries.  The only change I made was to mix the strawberries with a little more sugar than called for and then put them on top of the batter.  We ate the entire pan the first night we made it.

I didn't use the butter, just sprayed the baking dish with non-stick cooking spray.  I also used strawberries and I had a banana that I cut up and through in.  Tasted good!  Next time I think I wouldn't add as much sugar as my strawberries are plenty sweet.

I took some advice from other ratings, and cut back a little on the butter & sugar to lighten it up a little.  It turned out fantastic with fresh blueberries, will definately try with other fruits!  Yeah, so it's not a true cobbler recipe, but a delicious & easy to make dessert!

This went together very easily, I used fresh strawberries, but the center simply would not cook.  After about 45 minutes extra cooking time I gave up.  We can still eat it I guess.... Smells wonderful.

This is so Easy!! Great taste, too, but a litlle "tarty", not too sweet. Does not require any more ingredients than the average person has in her kitchen. I have made it this season with both strawberries and blueberries.

This cobbler/cake was AWESOME!! I had some unfortunate strawberries that were smushed on the way home from the grocery store that I still wanted to use and it worked out great! Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I was all excited about making a strawberry cobbler, and it flopped.  I guess i used too many strawberries or something b/c the center would not rise or bake.  I had to bake it so long that the sides got VERY brown.  From the pic i took of it, it looks baked, HA HA, but it wasnt underneath.  Darn the luck!!  Still had good flavor around the edges that did bake.  I sampled a little piece so i could rate the flavor.

I thought this was good, but not a cobbler per se. Mine had a chewy, cake-like consistency. The butter residue was not integrated with the batter, and
some of the salt didn't totally meld either. But it was a hit with my husband, so it couldn't have been all that bad--it was just not what I thought it would be in terms of consistency.

This was seriously the easiest fruit cobbler (more like buckle minus the streusel ) ever!  Followed recipe to a T the first time and then all other times almost to a T.  Only change i've madd was i did not pour the batter on top of the melted butter.  When i did that all the butter went to the edges and which ended up burning.  The next time..i gently poured it in so the butter did not retreat as easily.  No more burnt edges!

Turned out wonderfully!  My notes... I’m partially doing keto, so the only milk I have is whipped cream.   I used that and added 2 tablespoons (not measuring, just from my silverware drawer) of water to thin it.   I also just dumped a 16 oz bag of frozen mixed berries (my thinking 2 c = 16 oz) even though the recipe said 12 oz of frozen fruit.

Oh my gosh, this is fantastic when you use the frozen fruit method. *Gorgeous* restaurant-quality look and *so* quick. I just broke up the frozen berries from Aldi and tossed them in the batter. The 4 Tbs of butter seemed a tad high to me, so I may try 3 next time. Delightful recipe and so easy!! I'm posting it on Facebook.

Super easy recipe. I doubled ingredients to make enough for dinner guests. I used raspberries, blueberries and one sliced peach...in other words, all the fresh fruit I had on hand. I also tossed the fruit in a bit of flour before adding to the batter so the fruit would not all sink to the bottom. Turned out awesome! Thanks.

I increased the fruit (fresh nectarines) to 3 cups and decreased the sugar to 1/2 c. which was plenty sweet for my taste. Next time I will decrease the butter to 2 or 3 T as others recommended and add vanilla, and cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice depending on what I think is appropriate for the berries or fruit I use. This was absolutely delicious and will be my only cobbler recipe. I served it warm with Cool Whip.

This is super yummy and so very comforting.  I made this today with NJ summer peaches and blueberries.   Like other reviewers I used more than the original recipe's 2 cups of fruit (double that) and I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.   I also added some fresh ground nutmeg and a little lemon zest to the peaches and blueberries for warmth and brightness.  4 tablespoons of butter is PLENTY!  I might even cut back to 3 next time.   I did follow another reviewers suggestion to let the butter brown a little and I think it's a nice touch.  
The beauty of this basic recipe is that you can customize it with simple spices and selections of fruits to your liking and according to season.    I'm excited to try it with frozen fruit in the winter months when fresh produce isn't as readily available.   This recipe is a keeper... One that you can easily commit to memory for a warm cakey fruit cobbler no matter where you are.

Well, I'm not sure how such an easy recipe comes out tasting so fantastic but it did!
I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  The only change was to make some whipping cream with some grated fresh nutmeg and a little sugar.  
The amount of sugar in the cobbler was already enough so I certainly didn't want to go over the top.  The nutmeg was, however, a nice touch.  Could have used even more!  Thanks so much for a simple, great recipe.  I have some peaches ripening on the counter....can't wait to make them next week :-)

I made this recipe with frozen blackberries, and used approximately 4 cups of fruit after reading the other reviews.  It turned out great!  I may use less sugar next time if I use a sweeter fruit.

I have made this several times now using different combinations of fresh or frozen fruit. This is my favorite easy dessert. Family loves it and it is perfect for company. Tonight's fruit was nectarines, sweet cherries and blueberries.  Perfect every time with whatever fruit is available. Thank you for sharing.

This is the best cobbler I’ve ever baked and eaten. It’s not too sweet and is incredibly easy to make. My husband, who is not really into desserts, even looks forward to it.

This recipe is seriously idiot-proof! So very simple and always turns out great. I've tried it with many different combos of fresh fruit and all have worked, from assorted berries, to peach, etc. Highly recommend!

Easy as pie (as cobbler?)!! I really didn't think this recipe would work, but it surprised me. I used about 2 1/2 cups of nectarines and 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries. I will definitely add a splash of vanilla next time I make this recipe, and possibly some spice(s) that go with the fruit I'm using. Also like the suggestion of using golden yellow sugar instead of white sugar on top of the batter before baking. In winter, I could see serving this room temperature with a hot brown sugar, custard or rum sauce instead of the whipped cream.

Delicious and lovely presentation.  Very easy and a great way to use up some fresh summer fruits that may not be so beautiful.  I used a combination of peeled nectarines, halved pitted red cherries, blueberries and quartered strawberries.  The only change I made was to use almond milk.  Baked in a large ceramic pie pan.  Really good with vanilla ice cream.

Terrific recipe. Easy. Fast. Tasty. I winged it and used 2/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup almond milk (what I had), plus added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to batter; used about 2-1/2 cups diced nectarines spread out over the batter, but all else the same ~ and I sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar on top before baking. Baked 60 minutes. Crunchy crust, yet cakey, too. Declared as a keeper by the taste~testers. It’s already half~gone this morning! Definitely won’t last past lunchtime. Will make with nectarines and strawberries next.

The taste was great! but by 50 minutes it was overcooked and the crust hard. If I was to make it again, I would bake for less than the recommended time

I made it as best as I could, but I had the wrong size pan. Seeing as how the berries were going to turn soon, I went with it, just adjusted the cooking time. Since it was gonna be a bit wrong anyway, I also added a crumb topping too, gilding the lily or just maximizing the caloric intake, lol. 
Very tasty though! I had blackberries and raspberries and I've never made a cobbler or buckle or ANYTHING really, teehee, but can't wait to try it with the right size pan! Peace and keep on cooking!!

If I make this again, I will add more fruit.  In my opinion, there was too much batter for the amount of fruit recommended.  It tastes great.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I increased the butter from 4 tablespoons to 6 tablespoons, per reviews, let the butter brown in the oven, and added an extra teaspoon of flour to soak up juice from the raspberries. It came out perfect, very flavorful, and not too sweet! So easy to make, I'm adding this to my favorite recipes!

flavors good but where this recipe really shines is it's ease and versatility.  add some almond extract to the batter to kick it up a notch.

Super easy batter. I mixed it while cooking supper. It's cold and wet outdoors so this fruit cobbler will test great after supper. I mixed the fruit, 1 1/2 C. pears with 1 1/2 C. peaches. Not necessary to cook them on stove top but I did, with 1 C. sugar, 1 C. water, 1 T. cornstarch. Makes a good fruit base. Pour into 9x12 buttered or oiled pan or glass. Pour cobbler batter over fruit. Bake as directed on recipe. Very fruity, You can use 2 C. fruit. I used 3 C. Batter is excellent!

My batch took a little longer to cook, I don't know why, but it  tasted really good.  I am going to make this again and see if I can get this down right.

I have been making this for 30+ years. I have taken it to numerous social occasions and it has been a crowd pleaser. The melted butter makes for a rich baked base. Try it!????

This was so delicious and very easy for a last minute, quick dessert.  I used a bag of frozen fruit, so did not even have to go to the store.

Turned out great! We don’t use sugar so I replaced with half the amount of honey and still worked well. Per other reviews I added a little extra flour and put the berries in the pan before the batter, doesn’t seem like order mattered but this was great to evenly distribute the berries. And increase berries to 3C per other reviews. Super easy, will definitely be a go to in the future!

This is a very easy and fun recipe to make.  My ten year old made it tonight.  We used gluten-free flower and almond milk, and only half a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup of sugar.  We used frozen raspberries and strawberries for fruit.
Turned out absolutely delicious.

Reduced the white sugar by 1/3 cup and used  1/3 cup light brown sugar. Used 4 peeled ripe peaches. It was so good. I'll definitely make it again.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  I actually had another one on this page in mind, but I didn't have an ingredient that was needed, so I began searching for a different recipe, and this one only called for a few simple ingredients.  I wasn't prepared for how good this would taste since it was so quick and easy to put together.  Honestly, this one knocked the family's socks off!  Both my elderly parents, as well as my 30-something son and wife were impressed.  I'll make this one again---and often.  It just doesn't get any easier. The butter melts in the dish in the oven while the oven preheats, you whisk together a handful of staple ingredients that you pour onto the melted butter, top that with some fresh or frozen fruit, sprinkle with a bit of sugar, put it in the oven, and sit back and enjoy the intoxicating aroma of a homemade dessert that you won't even want to share with everyone else!  Delicious!  This is now my go-to cobbler recipe.  I don't need to search for an other one.

Amazing..  Easy and delicious.  I increased the recipe by ?  a I was using  a 9 x 13 for a larger group.  About 6 large peaches, peeled and I used an additional 1/2 of sugar on the sliced peaches coating them before placing them in the batter!  

A HIT FOR SURE..  Will make again with any fruit.  Not a weight watcher recipe, but delicious.  The bottom browned, the peaches were wonderful ..  a hit with my friends.  Apple/cranberry at xmas?????  I will do this again and again.

I was skeptical, but whoa this is great! Super easy and really good! However it is a bit too sweet than necessary for me; next time I will drop the amount of sugar used by 1/4 cup.

This is so easy to make and it is so good. I use the frozen berries and with some ice cream or whipped cream it makes the best dessert for your family and company. You can add a little cinnamon and sugar for the topping instead of just the sugar for an added flavor.

The recipe is so simple. I reduced sugar since I don't like it too sweet and add additional 2 minutes broil to make the top brown. I made it with plum and the cobbler came out perfect.

So versatile, so easy. I was a little worried because I have a family full of picky eaters and they all loved it! One person recommended putting the fruit in first. Mine all slid to one corner when I did that. We tried it with blueberries and strawberries because that’s what I had on hand, but I’m sure it will be great with many other fruits.

No changes. The cast iron with the butter made a crispy edge to it.  Used fresh blackberries.

Doubled this recipe to fit into an 8" x 11" glass pan.  Used slightly less butter than called for.  Replaced some of the white sugar with brown sugar (about half).   Added 1 tsp. vanilla to batter.  Stirred about 5 cups of wild blackberries (which I had frozen before use)  with 2 tablespoons of lime juice in a large bowl for more tanginess before adding to batter.  Baked at 350 for slightly longer than called for, about 65 minutes.  So tasty and so very easy!  Would definitely make this again!!

Followed the recipe exactly and this is the easiest, best tasting fruit (blueberry) cobbler EVER! In my particular oven, it was done baking in 25 minutes using a square 8x8 baking pan.

Made this with tart cherries from our tree as my birthday "cake" for lunch today, since I have to go to work and won
t be home for dinner. It was so good, the family will not be having any for dinner either, as it is all gone!!! I added a bit more fruit- would probably cut down on the sugar with sweeter fruit, but this was good with the tart cherries. It stuck to the pan, so I might spray the pan and then just stir the butter in- I will definitely be making this again- really easy and quick!

I sued a combo or nectarines, blueberries and raspberries.  Also I added some cinnamon to the batter.  Was hard not to eat it all at once!

very nice to a family favorite . much easier spread fruit over  the batter. Makes a pretty dish as the batter bubbles up into the fruit

I have made this recipe with many different kinds of fruit.  I always get compliments on it from young and old.  It can be served with ice cream or whipped cream.  I prefer it warm, so if  I have leftovers I reheat in microwave.  This is a very easy and quick dessert to make.

Worked just like the recipe said. Next time I’ll add the extra T of flour as the berries were very juicy. Served with ice cream and it was a big hit.

I used a 10 inch cast iron skillet. It took about 45 minutes and probably came out thinner because of the pan size. I used less blueberries.   I weighed out 12 ounces and decided about 8 or 9 ounces was sufficient.  It was. Very tasty warm with a good quality vanilla bean ice cream.  Am going to sprinkle cinnamon sugar over it next time. Yum!

I made this using a gluten free flour , cashew milk and over 2 cups of strawberries and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and it turned out pretty good. It was a bit goopy on the bottom and if I make it again I'll try putting the fruit in first and pour the batter on top to see if that seems better. The edges turned out crunchy. But I wouldn't add more butter as suggested by some as there was butter on top when I pulled it out of the oven after baking for an hour. Maybe I should have kept it in for another 10 minutes.

First time reviewer...  this recipe is amazing.  I made it exactly as directed.  The fruit I used was sliced farm-fresh strawberries (2 cups) and it was so good that I wanted it all for myself!  I was good, though, and shared it to rave reviews.  I would like to try it with a bit of ground cinnamon and ginger to add a bit more dimension, but it is awesome as is!

Couldn't be simpler! Made this for dessert for Father's Day lunch and there are no leftovers!I used peaches, strawberries, and blackberries! I kept aluminum foil over the top until the last 10-15min so that it cooked evenly and didn't brown the edges too fast. Will absolutely be making this again!

My husband said this is the best cobbler I’ve ever made.  I used farm fresh peaches and blueberries, and  I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra cup of fruit. I LOVE me some butter, but I wish I would’ve taken the advice of some reviewers and cut it down to 3 Tbs. I found it to be a bit greasy.

doubled the recipe as I was using a 10 inch rather deep skillet. Turned out perfect! I thought it would be kind of bland and boring- made it at my sister's request- but this is comfort food at its finest. I used frozen mixed berries, also fresh sliced peaches and strawberries. PERFECT with ice cream. MMMM

I have been making this for years!  It is the best and easiest fruit cobbler.  I usually make it most when blackberries are in season.  Love to go pick fresh blackberries and then make this tasty cobbler to enjoy them in.

I was looking for a quick dessert and decided to try this after reading the reviews. I made as directed and used frozen strawberries, and since they were frozen I used them whole. I also used some frozen blueberries to fill in the spaces between the strawberries so I did use more fruit than the recipe called for. I was worried that they wouldn't cook well because they were frozen. I cooked it until the top was nicely browned which was only about 5 minutes longer that stated. The fruit cooked fine and the dessert was very delicious! Hubby loved it too. I served it with whipped cream. I loved the easy prep and it tastes as good or better than the more involved cobblers I have made. Next time I will try peaches! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe is so easy!! I experimented by adding a bit less sugar and adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Also decided to add vanilla & cinnamon. I would recommend doubling the dough portion as it’s a thin layer & wont last long. I might also try using more flour to make the batter thicker but if you don’t like a crunch then this recipe is spot on!!

OMG!  I made it this morning.  5 Stars!  I had a bag of Trader Joe's frozen pitted Cherries in my freezer and that's the fruit I used.  Followed the recipe to the T.  It is amazing!  This will definitely be on my most popular list forever.  So Simple and So Delicious!

I make a double-batch of batter and keep it in the refrigerator. When we need a quick dessert, I bake for 30-35 minutes in ramekins (or a muffin pan) to make individual cobblers with a large spoonful of berries (previously frozen) or canned pie filling.

The easiest dessert ever. Everybody likes it. I’ve made it with different fruit -apricots, pineapple, peaches- depending on what i have on hand, and it’s always delicious.

Sooo easy and yummy! I used frozen mixed berries and because of the 50 min in oven turned out great, made it even easier.  Definitely will make again and again. Would be a quick dessert to make when friends over. Thanks!

We LOVE this recipe.  It is so easy and the butter gives the edges a wonderful little crust.  My 22 year old daughter lives on her own, several states away, and I sent her the recipe because its simplicity is right up her alley and she agrees that it is easy and quick and great. You don't even need a mixer. 

I've also made some variations, such as (1) no fruit and adding 1/2 cup coconut and reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and (2) no fruit, 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup pumpkin.  This results in a more cake like dessert that is moist and doesn't require any frosting to make it a really good snack cake.  

I will make this again and again.

I've made this with blackberries twice, and once with peaches. All three turned out wonderful. Just have to give the cornstarch a chance to thicken.

This was a quick and easy way to use up freshly picked raspberries and blackberries before they went bad! The only change I made was that I used 1/4 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 C all purpose flour instead of the 3/4 C all purpose flour. The cobbler was delicious served warm minutes out of the oven and just as good the next day served at room temperature. Will make it again.

Couldn't be easier or much better!  Made the first time, exactly as stated...very good!  Made the next time with another cup of mixed fruit (peaches, strawberries, mango, and blueberries) and  a squeeze of lemon. Placed the mixture  in a 10" glass pie plate. I placed it on a baking sheet before putting it into the oven because I was afraid it might overrun.  Glad I did:)  It was delicious, once again! Thanks for sharing such an easy, tasty recipe!

This is an excellent recipe as written. Dont be tempted to pull it out of the oven too soon; when it is a nice medium dark brown, the crust crisps up beautifully - using a bundt pan. I've experimented with

This is a great easy recipe! I didn't use as much sugar as the recipe calls for. I used 1/2 cup of sugar. With the fresh berries, the cobbler was plenty sweet. Will definitely make it again!

A 'knock-out' according to my husband!  Had this simple & easy recipe whipped up in 5-10 minutes and it turned out great!! Used a blend of fresh cherries, strawberries, & blackberries (the cherries were the real star in this recipe though) and increased fruit to 3 cups! Served with whipped cream! DELICIOUS!  Have already shared this recipe with others and will definitely make it again!

Made it just as directed, except I'm gluten intolerant so used Better Batter flour added 1/2 teaspoon of Xanthane gum. I was using up some nectarines and berries from our gardens so used closer to 3 cups fruit, very good. Will try with cinnamon and either nectarines or peaches.

The simplest, most amazing summer dessert ever! I followed the recipe exactly the 1st time I made it, then used suggestions of others my 2nd time.  The changes made a slightly better final product.  I increased butter to 6 T., added 1/4 c. more flour (high altitude), and used 3 c. of fresh peaches. I put the fruit directly in the butter, and then poured the batter over before adding the final sprinkling of sugar! Yum!

Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique. You weren't lying when you said it was easy. It didn't even have to bake for an hour. It was crispy and bubbly in 40 minutes. I tripled the recipe to serve to friends tonight so I piled on the fruit which was a very good idea. God bless and good day.

Just gotta be careful with the liquid from the fruit. Otherwise this was easy to make and I had everything on hand. Great for using up some berries I had from our yard.

We make this all the time and my teenagers love it! Since my son loves the cake part more than the fruit, I once made the cake without fruit and added fresh fruit and whipped cream on top like strawberry shortcake. Today I made it without fruit again, using a muffin pan and just divided the butter in 12ths and melted in each cup. We'll have berries and whipped cream on top tonight. The batter makes a yummy buttery cake or muffin! I can't wait to try this with pineapple!

Will make again as it was tasty, but will probably cut back on the sugar. A good option for those who do not care for the "biscuit top" cobblers.

I followed the comments from " laurab" and used 6 T of butter, 2 C of fresh peaches and 1 C fresh blueberries. Topped each serving with a bit of plain yogurt mixed with brown sugar. A big hit at my dinner party, just the right amount for 6 servings.  As I am NOT a baker or desser eater, this was a Perfect recipe for me!

It certainly was easy enough to make, but not something I would ever make again.  I used strawberries and rhubarb.  Just average.

This is so good and so easy I made it two nights in a row for my family.... I used blackberries, strawberries and blueberries....  the only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla.... I topped it with the easy whipped cream recipe on this site and it was a huge hit.  Great if you want something impressive with a short prep time....

I believe that some people would think that putting canned peaches would be "cheating" or would make the cobbler taste gross or artificial, but I tried it and the cobbler tasted DELICIOUS! After that, I made the cobbler 3 other times in a week and a half period of time, that's how good it tasted!  SO YUMMY!!!

This was an easy cobbler to make and was ready for the oven in minutes. I made 1 change adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Used frozen strawberries and it turned out great twice. My friends loved it.

3.20.17  This certainly is quick, easy and tasty, but I can’t say I was 100% happy with its presentation.  I just didn’t care for the way all the fruit that was scattered on top of the batter baked up looking dry.  Next time I’ll try mixing in at least some of the fruit into the batter.

Too spongy. Easy? Yes but so is an Apple crisp and I prefer the texture of a crumb topping instead. Any fruit can be used for these but this recipe reminded me of pancakes.

I tried it - you can actually do it with any fruits - my fruits are even frozen as at this time you can't find fresh berries here - you can also try put cherries as they go fantastic with it. 
If you dont have baking powder is it good option to use yeast or baking soda?

We loved this! I used frozen strawberries that I thawed and drained, and added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to the batter. To make this work, the butter has to be hot when you pour the batter into the pan. Next time I will use a round pan as I think it would make it easier to serve. After putting back in the oven, I did reduce the heat to 3250F as some reviewers complained of the edges getting overdone before the middle cooked. I cooked for 50 minutes and it came out perfect!

I loved this recipe- very simple to put together and yet so delicious!   Received great reviews from my dinner guests!   I used all fresh fruit: raspberries, blackberries &  strawberries, but increased to 3 cups per other reviewer's recommendations.  It turned out perfectly, served warm with vanilla ice cream.

It didn't need to bake near as long as the recipe said - mine was ready in about 40 minutes, so keep an eye on it.  I also didn't have any white sugar so I used 1/2 cup of brown (it isn't likely too many people need that substitution!) and it turned out great!  Used fresh black berries and frozen blue berries.  Served it with some natural ice cream.  Yum!

EASY & SUPER DELISH! I made 2, one for me and one for my daughter's family.
Per Laurab, I added more fruit and more butter. I freeze my own blueberries and used 18 oz  frozen each and 6 T of butter. I think there was just a tad too many berries, but hubby didn't agree. I will definitely make again & again & again, using 14-15 oz frozen berries next time. This is a super quick, very very easy recipe and my new all-time favorite dessert. I submitted this recipe to my family cookbook, created every 10 years. You can't screw this up and it can be assembled while making dinner. This is a 5 star recipe. We served it with ice cream the first night and with fresh whipped cream the next. We prefer a small dab of whipped cream because this cobbler is stand alone!!! Magnificent!

I was a little skeptical when I first read the recipe.  Then after I read a lot of the reviews, decided to make it with some large blackberries I had purchased at Sam's Club.  This small cobbler turned out fantastic.  I am guilty of adding a little more fruit than what was called for in the recipe, but it didn't hurt a thing and it is great.  It is hubby approved, so I will definitely be trying this recipe with other types of fruit.

Great recipe! The batter bubbled up and browned nicely with a great buttery crunch around the edges, and the fruit developed a nice, thick, pie-filling-like texture. 

Next time I make this, however, I'll adjust the sugar content according to the fruit I use. I made this with frozen blueberries, and it was super sweet, so I'd drop the sugar to 1/2 C. in the batter and 2 tsp. to sprinkle over.

Wonderful ! Easy to make abs so delicious!   I doubled the recipe and made a couple small changes; I did a 1/3 more of the batter & butter, added a pinch of cinnamon,  added about a 1/3 of a cup more sugar to the batter (for the whole dbl recipe), and sprinkled blueberries with lemon juice before adding them. This will definitely be a family repeat recipe!

The extra butter suggestion was spot on. I had a 16oz bag of frozen blackberries and I think that was too many berries to batter ratio.  Still something I'll happily make again!

This cobbler is ridiculously simple to make and delicious. Made it on a whim, since I had all the ingredients. I followed the recipe to a T and had no problems. I had to use frozen fruit, since I didn't have enough fresh fruit to add. Turned out great! Will definitely be making again.

This is such a terrific recipe to have at hand. Had to use up a large (Costco sized) bag of whole strawberries. I doubled the batter and made 2 - one for the freezer. Any berry or combination is great. It whips up so quickly then into the oven for an hour while I prepare the rest of the meal or make ahead and refrigerate, or freeze! 
I should call this 'My Buddy'. Everyone likes it. Gluten free flour is fine, too. My Celiac child loves it!!

Made with 4 kinds of fresh berries. Loved how tasty it was with so little effort. Added little vanilla extract, next time will reduce sugar & butter, add more fruit.

Super quick to throw together to put in the oven! I used whole wheat flour, and about 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar. I served it with a big bowl of fresh whipped cream. The end result was delish and got polished off in 10 minutes.

Made this delicious and easy cobbler for our Christmas dinner dessert and it received raves. I made it exactly like the recipe only I doubled it using two frozen bags of mixed berries and then baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. Wonderful topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Yum!

Honestly, I've made a lot of things on Allrecipes, and I love to bake, and this was SUPER doughy. I don't know if I did something wrong, or what happened-- but yikes. I'd add eggs or something to make it rise more -- this was not cobbler. :(

Delicious and simple. I used frozen home-grown raspberries we'd put away from the summer. The only issue is that I should have baked it a little longer. Can't wait to try it with peaches and blueberries.

I used fresh blackberries with a small bag frozen strawberries and it was wonderful.  Had it for a family gathering and everyone, especially the grandkids, loved it.  If I had known how easy and good it was I would have doubled the recipe.  I cut the sugar back to about 2/3 C. as the fruit just didn't need quite that much.  Definitely will make again.

I always add 1-2 eggs to this recipe - I find it makes it a little more custardy, which I prefer!  With my addition, it is very similar to a pancake batter (but with way more sugar)!

I really liked the flavor of the cake part, but I would not use raspberries in this recipe. They turned to mush. Even using extra berries, this was not fruity enough. I would try this again with blueberries, which are a little heartier.

Very good and easy recipe! I had a huge peach that needed to be used and some strawberries as well. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except for a little cinnamon with the tablespoon of sugar sprinkled on top. Will make again with different fruits. Thanks for a good and quick recipe!

Easy, delicious, and it was exactly what the description lead me to expect. 

I have a 10 inch round pan, so I rounded up the proportions to an even cup of sugar, flour, and milk and used six tablespoons of butter. I then used two cups of raspberries and two pears, and it was a hit. This recipe scales well and seems flexible enough for most fruits, though it might be a bit dry with apples.

I have made this recipe using blueberries once and raspberries once. It was absolutely delicious both times. There are recipes similar to this, but most of them have too much breading that overpowers the taste of the fruit. This recipe seems to get the ratio just right. Also, the sprinkling of sugar on top gives the cobbler a nice "crunch."

I'll definitely make this again and will go with the tweaks suggested by others - 6tbs butter and fruit goes in first, sugar on top and then the batter.  My oven cooked it in 42-45 minutes and it was perfect!

We made this for a dinner party. Based on the reviews, we  kept the dry ingredients per the recipe but put in 4 cups of fruit - nectarines, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. It turned out great and got rave reviews. Needless to say it was all gone but the time people left.

I wanted to fill a 9" x 13" pan so I doubled the batter. I read the other reviews & decided to increase the fruit. I used 2 pints each blackberries & raspberries plus I added 1 1/2 cups of strawberries. I substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar for a richer flavor. This is a super easy not too sweet cobbler. I'm looking forward to trying other fruits since it's so versatile. I also lined my pan with foil to make cleanup a breeze!

I made this delicious pudding a few months ago and  it was easy and delicious.  About the best one I have ever made.  Iam planning on making  it again tomorrow night  for supper dessert.
I will add extra fruit like suggested probably 3 cups instead of two, and probably more butter as suggested in one review.

So easy and ridiculously good! I'm always asked how I make this! My husband likes more of the cobbler than fruit so I do use the recommended amount or less but honestly, you can't mess this recipe up! Amazing!

This is a favorite go-to recipe. It doubles or triples easily.  My two fruit combinations are peaches and blueberries in the summer.  For the single size recipe I use about 2 cups of fruit--one peach cut in chunks and then a bunch of blueberries.  The rest of the year a use a combination of apple and cranberries.  One apple, any kind and throw in a bunch of frozen or fresh whole cranberries.  Works every time.

Was quite good. It lived up to its name - it's definitely easy and tastes fine.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Even though some of the fruit does sink to the bottom (as it's supposed to) I'd rather have the cobbler sit on top of the fruit to get a nice crisp crust.

This was the best recipe I've found so far for fresh fruit cobbler.  I doubled the batter recipe mixing in the melted butter with the batter as other readers suggested.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, used six medium peaches and topped the peaches with about 1-1/2 cups of blueberries.
Delicious warm with vanilla ice cream.

Made this 3 times in the last few weeks, with these changes: kamut flour in place of all purpose; fat free half and half for the milk (always on hand here, no other reason); a generous splash of vanilla, cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg in the batter; 6, not 4, tablespoons of butter, which melted and browned a bit for added yumminess; pour at least 3 cups fruit (any which is on hand) on butter, and top with batter.  Sprinkle when cooked with a bit of coconut sugar.  Great stuff, with or without ice cream topping.

I only used slightly more than half a cup of sugar and it tasted slightly tart and perfect.  We love the way the butter on the bottom of the glass pie pan caramelized under the cake.  A hit!

Its blueberry season, but not a lot of time. Luckily I came upon this delightful little recipe and put it together in no time.
I can't wait to make a peach and a cherry one. ILoveIt

I made this for a July 4th party.  It was very easy.  However it's not a very pretty dessert.  I was a little embarrassed to bring it to the party -- especially when  my friend brought a beautiful strawberry pie.  That said, the cobbler beat the pie hands down.  And I will definitely be making it again!

I didn't change a thing about this recipe, and I was sorely unimpressed. I think that the instances with better reviews must have included other ingredients to spice this up, or maybe changed the proportions. I thought it was too salty and very bland, and the texture was sort of mealy. I wouldn't make this again without substantial modifications.

This was real easy and quite tasty.  I added more fruit.  I used plums , peaches and blueberries, all fresh. I also added a little cardamom and cinnamon.   It was a little "oily", as one reviewer wrote, when first out of the oven,  but I don't think you can cut it down very much, and  it was even better after being in the fridge a few days and then reheated.  My husband loved it.

This is excellent, but it definitely needs more than two cups of fruit. I used three generous cups. What's nice is that you can mix up the dry ingredients in advance and put the butter in the dish ready to melt, so you can compile everything and get it into the oven in a jiffy once you know when you'll be wanting to serve a nice warm dessert. Sixty minutes was ample baking time in my oven; next time I would take a look after 50 or so and possibly remove it because the edges were crustier than I like.

I made it according to the recipe, with boysenberries.  My husband ate half of it at the first sitting.  It was so easy I made three of them (and a good thing, too)!  I froze some raspberries, so we will be having raspberry cobbler in our future.

So easy!  This is the best recipe to use to clean out your freezer! I had so many 1/2 open bags of frozen fruit and partial pints of assorted berries. It was time to toss them, or make a cobbler! 

Recipe is super easy, all stuff I already have in the house. I'm favoriting this recipe to use again. Yum!

I loved this!  I had some  lovely, large and plump fresh blueberries so I went looking for a nice recipe to use some in!  This one sounded so easy too so you gotta love that!  I followed the recipe except for adding  about another 1/2 cup of blueberries and as blueberries don't have as vibrant a flavor some other fruits, I also added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract to the batter.  The two add such a nice flavor to batters!  This is a scrumptious cobbler and I will use it with all of the lovely fresh fruit coming our way this Summer here in The Okanagan Valley!!!

This one definitely goes into the favorite recipe category!  I made this for our Memorial Day family BBQ and it was a huge success. It was necessary for me to increase the amount of servings to 12, which tripled the ingredients. I used 2 cans of sliced peaches (I drained the juice), 2 qts. fresh strawberries and 1 qt. of fresh blue berries. I had to cook it a bit longer until it was a beautiful golden brown on top.  It was delicious!

Very easy - needed something for desert and didn't have much on hand to work with.  Found this - got out two cans of Fruit Cocktail - drained them and made this recipe!    Looks very yummy  but  can't try it till after dinner!

Followed the directions for the most part, except added extra butter per multiple suggestions. Wish I would have remembered that several folks also mentioned adding an extra cup of fruit, mostly because I had several nectarines I needed to use. I was worried how it would turn out, because the cup and a half of nectarines I used weren't sweet and the half a cup of cherries I used varied from not quite ripe to a bit overripe. Just in case, I was a bit more liberal with the sugar on top, and it turned out delicious. Not so much a cobbler as a fruity pudding, custard cake, but who cares what you call it if it is tasty? Will definitely make again with whatever random fruit I have around that needs to be eaten up.

I have to play around with this recipe.  There's entirely too much sugar and butter, which is shocking since I love both.  I used strawberries, and they were a bit too bitter, so I'll stick to the blueberries and/or blackberries.

Delicious! Had more strawberries than recipe called for, doubled it in a 9 x 13" pan, baked a bit longer to get done in center. I used freshly milled grain and sucanat for the sugar, as well as almond milk and half and half as that is what I had on hand. Turned out better than expected since it is such a simple recipe. Will definitely use this again as my go to cobbler recipe! Thank you for the recipe!

Very simple recipe and yet very delicious.  I made this with peaches and blueberries and almost doubled the fruit.  I like loads of fruit.  I baked it in an eight by eight pan and it came out of the oven perfect.  Rave reviews from my family!

Very easy to make and a terrific for Gluten Free dessert fans. Used Pamela's products pancake mix (instead of flour). Also used brown sugar instead of white to give the dessert a richer taste, and used apples (Gala) and also a 1/4 Tsp of pumpkin pie spice to move the taste up a notch. Company loves this dessert, and it is very easy.

We're moving in a bit, and I have to use up all the stuff in my pantry and freezer, which included a 48 oz. bag of strawberries and a 12 oz. bag of mixed berries.  The ingredients in this recipe just happened to require EVERYTHING I wanted to get rid of, but because of the amount of fruit I had, I pretty much quintupled the recipe and made two 9x11 pans, which made things a little more difficult, but not much.  This is a FABULOUS recipe!  I could see using apples, pears and cranberries in the fall, peaches and berries in the summer -- the possibilities are endless with fruit, and adding your own flair (different spices or extracts) would enhance it that much more.  Will absolutely make this again and again!

I made this today with a blueberries and raspberries I had to use up. Didn't measure the fruit...may have been a bit more than two cups but turned out excellent! Not sure how this got a poor review for being "greasy"...mine was not in the least. Will be my go to for fruit cobblers!

I found the bread part of this recipe quite tasty! Thank you so much for this easy cobbler recipe. I unfortunately did not have fresh fruit and used instead a can of blueberry pie filling. It worked fairly well, however made it a tad too sweet. Fresh fruit would have been best as the recipe listed.

So easy! I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla to the milk (I just like vanilla).  I used two peach fruit cups (had them in the pantry), along with 2 pints of fresh raspberries because my raspberries didn't look like enough fruit.  Smelled wonderful as it baked.  Keeping this one for other fruits in my recipe box. Thanks for the recipe!

I too was skeptical of this recipe because of its simple instructions.  I made the recipe as is (except with only 3 T of butter) and added fresh blueberries and frozen peaches (thawed).  It was delicious.  My husband and guests really enjoyed it and we have enough for leftover tonight!

Just made this with fresh raspberries and frozen blueberries and by far the best cobbler I've ever made or eaten. Had a serving about 15 minutes out of the oven with a little whipped cream. Did not change a thing in the origial recipe and it was perfect! Thanks for posting, I've passed on to all my cooking friends.

Followed recipe and it was ok. Kids left partial leftover pan in fridge untouched for two days so I won't be making this one again. Bright side is that it is easy to prepare.

Not too sweet. Perfect cobbler. Great with blueberries.

Simply the best and easiest cobbler out there.  I regularly add more or less fruit depending on what I'm going for without any problems.  I also trade out milk for half and half or evaporated milk depending on what I happen to have on hand.

This is pretty much the exact same cobbler recipe that my mom has used throughout my childhood and always turns out well.  I have made this multiple times at both my house and my restaurant and it always gets rave reviews. I do make a few adjustments. I always use frozen fruit that I add a bit of lemon juice and cinnamon to. I also add cinnamon and a bit of cardamom to the batter mixture. I am pretty sure that my  deep south momma didn't use the cardamom, but it adds a nice flavor- just don't use too much!

I don't cook anything from scratch often, until recently when I found this website. This recipe, like so many others on this website, was very simple to follow. I used blueberries and the end result was very tasty!  I didn't alter the recipe at all.  I can't wait to try this with strawberries and other fruits.

Great simple cobbler I have used it several times with different fillings. I do add more fruit almost double personal Preference. I've done blueberry, raspberry and peach with a mix of all 3 in one. I also have used Apple filling. Not boughten but my homemade and it is yummy way better than a crisp if you ask me. Again personal preference.

Very tasty and easy!  I modified this recipe by using 6 tbs of butter.  I also added 2 tbs of flour, about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and about 1/8 tsp of ginger to the batter.  I made my cobbler with 3 cups of thawed blueberries and put them on the bottom after being tossed in the 1 tbs of sugar.  I will make this again!

I give this recipe 5 stars! I've made  this a million times and never has it failed to be delicious, with or without ice cream. I have made this for parties and special occasions, or just whenever I feel like it, because it's so easy. This recipe is super! Thanks for posting it.

A family favorite! I have done this recipe with every kind of fruit and it's always delicious. I have always used evaporated cane juice sugar and whole white wheat flour instead of white sugar and White flour. I have also made a vegan version with coconut oil instead of butter and soy milk instead of regular milk. My favorite way to make this recipe is to stew apples in my crockpot with flour sugar and cinnamon and then use that as the filling with extra evaporated cane juice sugar on top. So so yummy!

Very very good! I didn't warm it, and it was delicious anyway. I ate it with wipping cream, which is too fat...maybe icecream would be better. As Naples suggested, I increased half the quantities for a 8x8 pan. I used mostly blueberries and few strawberries. First time I made a cobbler:Thanks for the recipe !!

One of the easiest desserts I have ever made, but the results are truly impressive. The crust was golden and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It also smells amazing. Came out perfectly on the first try. It was slightly sweet for my taste, so if you don't like very sweet desserts, cut back on the sugar a little.

I made this to take to a Ladies Fellowship and it was a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it. I used mixed frozen berries. Every bit of it was eaten and they actually scraped the baking dish to get the last.of it. This was the easiesr cobbler I have ever made and it is delicious. This will be my.recipe of choice for cobbler. Thank.you!

I had some blueberries to use up, and they were way too sour to do what I usually do with blueberries...just eat them lol. This is certainly an easy way to deal with not the sweetest of fruit. I would prefer more of a biscuit texture than this cakey texture, perhaps that is the trade-off for simplicity. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 1 quart casserole dish. Worked fine and I enjoyed it.

I had a pint of blueberries going bad and a bag of frozen peaches getting freezer burn so I thought I would try this recipe and use them both. What a great recipe! So easy I threw it together quickly while dinner was in the oven and had a dessert ready when we were  done eating. I will be making this again!

This was an okay dessert but something about the cake part didn't seem right. Could it use an egg maybe? It is a nice fruit- topped pudding, tasty and easy to make for sure but if I make it again I'll add an egg and see how it turns out.

I followed one reviewer's advice which was to brown the butter and cook the cobbler until the batter turned a golden brown.  It was really good.  I also increased the fruit a little bit.  I doubled the batter recipe because I had too many peaches, and cooked two 8x8 pans together and it worked out just fine.

Easy and fast.  Used blueberries.
Truly makes 4 average size portions.  Could double portions next time.  Next time should probably do a bit less than 50 minutes - probably 45 minutes would be ok.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this recipe many times using different fresh fruit (raspberries, blackberries, peaches, blueberries).  The only change I've made is to add a bit of sugar to the fresh fruit before baking if I felt it wasn't sweet or ripe enough.  I also always make a double batch to bake in a 9x13 pan.  Everyone always raves and when I take to a gathering, there is never any leftovers to bring home! :)

Yummmmm ! !  The endless possibilities with this recipe. Have used all different kinds of fruit. Lovely, easy-to-make recipe ... 
For the butter melting part, I have melted butter in microwave first then poured on dish and it still works the same. 

Thinking about making it again

I made this in my 10.5" cast iron skillet and it was amazing!  I used 2.5 cups of blueberries.  The taste was delicious and the crisp edges were sooo good!  Next time though I'll need to add half again as much batter for that size pan.

I have used this with fresh blueberries and peaches. I usually just use two cups as directed although sometimes I add more. Either way it turns out delicious every time. Not only is it my favorite cobbler recipe, but if I need a dessert in a hurry I use this one because it's so easy to put together.

my husband doesn't usually like cobbler but he loved this one (I had to get a second piece to share with him after I gave him a bite of the first piece). I used white nectarines with the skin on. Sooo good!

This was a 5 star for us. We did use 3 C. peaches, and added a bit of cinnamon to the batter along with 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Really a truly easy and tasty recipe.

Very good!  You can add more fruit and also sprinkle some cinnamon on top with the sugar on peach cobbler.

Really, really excellent and so simple. I'm really glad I tried this. I can get rid of any other cobbler recipe. I used whole strawberries Lauren picked and filled the pan instead of measuring out. Otherwise, made as directed and baked for 50 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

I made a mistake and put 2 tsp. of baking powder and why no vanilla or Cinnamon? I would like to remake it with oats Quaker! It was so good with Vanilla Ice Cream on top!! I think, depending on the sweetness of the fruit to cut the sugar to 1/2, I used apricots and it was too sweet for me.

Super easy, super sweet! Great way to use up over-ripe nectarines. I used gluten-free Bisquick instead of flour and leavening, as that's what I had in the pantry. If I do this again, I'll cut sugar a tad as its already in baking mix. Served with vanilla ice cream, yummy summer treat.

This didn't work for us.  There are others much better.  For some reason the batter/cobbler stuff was gummy and gross.

Easter dinner winner! Went heavy on the strawberries and a bit of sugar, let sit overnight unrefrigerated. Made batter exactly as called for, then added a tsp or so of almond extract to the wet batter. Dessert doesn't get much easier, and this received rave reviews from experienced Southern cobbler eaters and rookies alike. New favorite cobbler recipe.

I tried it with cherries and found it to taste a bit salty.  That might have been my fault as I just eye-balled the salt I put in.  Anyway, I didn't much care for it.  I won't be making again.

This recipe is insanely good! I've made this for company, and for dessert night with friends, and it's always a hit! I found that it comes out better with frozen fruit, and I love to use Target's antioxidant blend (It has raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, cherries and pomengranates).

The edges and bottom fryed to an unpleasant hardness and the middle is like a flavorless soft bread. Luckily I added a lot more blueberries than the recipe called for and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar, so the cake was edible.

It was very easy to make. I made it with 2 bags of Dole Strawberries.
I tripled the recipe and made over 20 servings. I had placed the batter and fruit in a 9 x 13 pan. I am going to make this again next time with cherries. It was almost like a fruit cake. It was very good. We most likely will be eating it all week. This gets 5 stars from me. Debi18

I've tried this recipe with frozen strawberries before and it's delicious and easy.  This time I had 2 lg cans of cherry pie filling left over from the holidays so I decided to try it that way.  I doubled the recipe but left out the tablespoon of sugar on top because the cherries are already so sweet.  Served with a little vanilla ice cream it was a huge hit.  So wonderful and quick!

This was so awesome and easy, I already had everything I needed (so no shopping on short notice). I used unsweetened coconut/almond blend 'milk' instead of normal milk, and added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the batter. It turned out amazing!

This recipe is extremely simple and delicious.  My guests were amazed and loved it!  The only think I would do next time is reduce the sugar.  Also, I had a big group coming, so I tripled the recipe.   I used a 9 X13 pan for 1 hr. Definitely a keeper!

After reading other reviews, I used peaches and blueberries and doubled the quantity.  I also used 1/2 c. sugar and 1 TBS of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It turned out very good.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I have very little time & need an easy dessert that also impresses guests, I make this.....have experimented with different fruit.  Fresh strawberries are good as well.  Peaches were ok - blueberries are probably my favorite.  My husband loves the strawberry.  I add a little extra sugar on top before I bake.  And I always serve warm with Breyers vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe is so easy & perfect!!!!  I used an 8 x 8 dish with 2 cans of "no high fructose corn syrup" peach pie filling & sprinkled lots of cinnamon sugar on top prior to placing it in the oven.  Cooking the cobbler for 50 minutes was perfect!  We let it sit for 15 minutes to cool down & thicken up before digging in!!  My family absolutely loved it!!!  I will definitely use this recipe again & try different pie fillings for variety!!!

I took it out around 40-45 minutes, otherwise it would have burned. It It was a bit more buttery (taste, not texture) than I expected.  It's a bit mushy with the strawberries and chewy on the crust.  But I like chewy so I am happy.  Plus it made the house smell good.

I loved this recipe because it was so easy and quick to make. It calls for things I have on hand almost all of the time. We don't use much refined sugar in our household, so I used 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead and added in about 3/4 cup of steel cut oats to the batter. One of the critiques I read said that it didn't fill the pan. Maybe because of the added oatmeal, it filled the pan nicely in my case. I made it two nights in a row, once with raspberries and strawberries from the garden, and the following night with some peaches that were threatening to go bad before being eaten. It was fabulous both times!

So easy!  So delicious!  I did what others were saying, I added much more fruit than called for.  This made all the difference.  The edges were golden brown and crunchy.  I could eat this every day!

I threw this recipe together on a whim tonight and it was delicious! I followed the other comments and used an extra cup of fruit, 2 extra tablespoons of butter and an extra tablespoon of flour. I used frozen blueberries and a few fresh raspberries that I found in my fridge. My husband said that it was one of the best desserts I have ever made! I made a vanilla cream sauce for the top and it was heaven! Thank you!

Doubled this recipe with blueberries because we got a big package for free from Superstore for buying $250 in groceries.  So had to use them up. I loved this cobbler and ended up eating most of it.  Hubby not so much.  But then he's not a fan of cobbler so that's no reflection on this recipe. Very easy to make and tastes great with french vanilla ice cream. Highly recommend if you like cobbler.

Cobbler on a whim. I love it! I used frozen blueberries, light margarine and fat free milk. Yummy!! I want to try substituting Splenda for the bulk of the sugar and I can't wait to try this with other fruits! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

Dayum, this was good.  I made this with strawberries and replaced about an 1/8 cup of the sugar with my own cinnamon-sugar mixture (3 tbsp sugar: 1 tbsp cinnamon).  I sprinkled that mixture on top instead of the straight sugar as well.  I also made this with Earth Balance and almond milk, turning this dessert into an incredible vegan treat!

I love this recipe, easy and delicious.  I made it as per recipe, no changes, and used fresh blueberries, cherries, and raspberries.  The edges were crispy and buttery and the middle was fruity.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and the whole family was in heaven.  I love Pam's recipes; her scone recipe is my go to for scones and this will now be my go to for cobbler.  Thanks Pam!

This was delicious and ridiculously quick and easy. I used only 3 T butter and only 1/2 cup sugar combined brown and white. Also I substituted white whole wheat flour. The fruit I used this time was a combination of cherries, blueberries and raspberries. I will definitely be making this again with other combinations in the near future.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is now my go to cobbler recipe.  I made it last night for a small dinner party and everyone loved it.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 3+cups fruit (blueberries & peaches- yum!); I also cut back by 1/3 on the sugar but left all other proportions of the batter the same.  I placed fruit in the bottom of the dish and then poured batter over it.  It came out just beautifully with crispy edges, etc. I baked about 15 minutes or so longer than required until the top of the batter was golden brown and just sprung lightly to the touch.
Thanks to the author for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe had way too much butter.  I would cut it back or I would double the cake ingredients. It tasted good, but I will not make this again.

Unbelievably easy and delicious! The 2nd time I made it, I decided to use only 2.5 Tbsp butter and 1/2 C sugar and omit the sugar sprinkle on top and it still came out great! This can be made with many different fruits. It's now my go-to dessert!

I was looking for a way to use up some over-ripe peaches along with some blueberries and cherries.  It was very easy and my teenage daughter raved about it.  The only change I made to the dough was adding some cinnamon, which added a nice flavor.

Delicious and super easy! I used a mix of frozen blueberries and strawberries only because I didn't have anything fresh at the moment. This one is a keeper for me. I can't wait to use it with my next garden strawberries ~ Thanks for sharing!

This was everything I had hoped for! It is just like my mom's peach cobbler recipe, except she uses 1 cup milk, flour, and sugar. I used fresh raspberries and blackberries and frozen peaches. YUM!!! We put a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream on top and were in dessert heaven! The only things I did differently were to mix the (heaping) tablespoon of sugar with the berries and peaches first and I poured half of the melted butter into the batter. It was not dry at all, as some people had said. It was perfect!

I made this today because I had some strawberries that I wanted to use up. Oh my goodness. It was really good. As another writer suggested, you don't even need to put ice cream on top. I did put a little whipped cream, but I don't think it needed that either. I am anxious to try this with other fruits, especially since summer is coming and the fruits will be plentiful. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used a mix of frozen berrys.  Very delicious. My only complaint is that it is not very attractive.  I think that could be fixed with baking in ramikens or covering with vanilla ice cream.

My freezer went out and I had rhubarb, black cherries, strawberries and mangoes that had thawed.  I made the recipe using all the fruit together...doubled the batter and cooked the fruit on the stove top with sugar for about 30 mins.  Put it all together and baked it about 40 mins.  It's delicious!   Never would have used that combo if it weren't for the circumstance.

Very easy recipe. I used strawberries and sliced them instead of leaving whole. I did add about a handful or so more to blanket the batter. This recipe is extremelysimple and delicious.

Wonderful recipe, I enjoyed this a lot more than the last cobbler I found (which was entirely too dry.) Both my sons asked for more. It reminded us more of a cake than it did cobbler but tasted far better than my attempt at strawberry cake so I can't complain! The only change I made was omitting the last tablespoon of sugar - it was still plenty sweet for us.

Thanks for the go-to cobbler recipe I've been looking for. I had a few blackberries- fewer than the recipe calls for- and ended up with what we called a "Cobbler Cake". It was great, exactly the cobbler-dough flavor and texture I was after, and easy to see how perfect it will be as actual cobbler (with full-layer fruit). Our cake version was the result of blackberries spaced at about .5-1" apart on the batter. This left us with a solid enough cooked texture to be able to pick pieces up and eat like a brownie, but with the flavor and fresh fruit of a cobbler. Terrific!

Super easy to make! The prep time is fast too. And it tastes soooo amazing once it comes out of the oven that we don't even mind that it takes nearly an hour to actually bake it. I've made this 3 times already. First time was to try it out and the other two were both on Valentines day. My boyfriend loved it so much that he insisted I make it twice once we finished it the first time.

I made this with fresh strawberries and frozen blueberries. All I can say is WOW! We had it at room temperature and the cake part was scrumptious. Kind of chewy like a candy bar. I doubled the recipe and added an egg to the batter. Will be doing this one again.

Delish! I cut back on butter as suggested by another user (3 instead of 4). And Next time I'll bake it less time, about 40 minutes. 50 over cooked it :-/ but it was still very good!

So easy that I was sure it wasn't going to be very good. I had the batter ready and in the pan well before the oven was done pre heating. I followed the recipe exactly, using frozen blueberries and it turned out fantastic! It was delicious with vanilla ice cream. I will use this recipe again.

This was so amazingly easy and YUMMY! I usually serve cobblers with ice cream, I tried a little bite out of the pan, and OMG! This was great alone, awesome with a bit of vanilla bean ice cream! The only variance from the original recipe was about 1/2 cup more berries.

Yummy but I decreased the butter to 3tb and still had a little pool of melted butter when it cooked. But the overall taste wasn't effected so its more an esthetic issue

Absolutely the best and even better - the easiest dessert I have made. I did double the fruit in it as it was just a bit dough dominate on the first try, but delicious no less.  I used fresh nectarines the first go around, and then fresh peaches.  Both were very good, guess I liked the peaches more and that was when I doubled the fruit.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the peach cobbler and it was great.

I had just picked some blueberries and wanted to use them in something and came across this recipe. I followed some of the other suggestions, cut down the butter a bit and added more fruit. I may have added too much fruit! However, I have to say that this was super easy to make and absolutely delicious. My family demolished this dish!

Great even when substitution were made! Used whole wheat flour, light butter, and truvia instead of the sugar. Served with fat free frozen yogurt. Perfect for those on a diet or watching the fat.

Used Ground Cherries!!! and it was fantastic. My husband won't eat anything new, and he just thought it was peach. After he practically licked the plate I told him they were ground cherries. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the first cobbler I have ever made and it was so delicious.  I used a few fresh raspberries and blackberries that I had, and 1 can of blueberry pie filling, (cleaning out the pantry), and made no adjustments to the other ingredients. I've been wanting to use my cast iron pan and it was the perfect size for this recipe, it came out perfect and my family couldn't believe how good it was. The crisp buttery edges of the dough were amazing. Ate it all! I will be definitely making this again and again.

I thought that this was quite easy and not too bad.  I made it with blueberries and thought that it was a nice afternoon snack or even breakfast because it is not too sweet at all.  Almost like a buttery muffin loaded with berries.  I would make again but not sure I would make for guests as a dessert.  Not sweet enough and not really a 'wow' factor at all.  LIke the crunchy buttery corners!

Absolutely delicious. I used 6 Tablespoons of butter and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also made a crumble topping instead of using the sugar on top. A new family favorite for sure!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup the first try with peaches and blueberries and using reduced sugar again I tried using 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/4 cup cornmeal when I made it the second time using frozen strawberries.  Both times the results were great.  I liked being able to bake it in a ceramic pie plate in my toaster oven.  I am a big fan of Pam Anderson's recipes.  This one is now a family favorite.

This is a very good recipe for dispatching of overripe fruit. I found it fantastic when made, but it degraded quickly in the fridge and became soggy.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter came out spongy and dry. Horrid. Cobbler batter should turn out more like dumplings than cake.

This was terrible.  WAY too much butter, such that when adding the dough mixture to the pan, it ended up swimming in butter, which partially mixed with the dough and partially pooled on the sides of the pan.  At this point, I knew it wasn't going to turn out right, and even debated mixing the butter with the dough to at least even out consistency.  I ended up just baking it as instructed, and had similar results to other critical reviews - the crust on the outer corners baked nicely, while the center remained soggy and never firmed up.  Had I baked it any longer, the edges would have burned.  The parts that did bake through took on a very spongy, greasy texture.  Not even close to what I'd call a cobbler, and largely inedible - won't be making this one again.  If you decide to make this recipe, pay close attention to the modifications suggested by other reviewers.  I wish I had.

I've made this exact cobbler no less than 15 times in the last 18 months. Though, I probably use closer to 3 cups of fruit and sometimes I add a dash of cinnamon on top--but not always. It's ridiculously easy and ridiculously delicious. I was skeptical at first, but I tried it, and it'll be one of my staple recipes for the rest of my life. Enjoy!

This is an awesome recipe!  I did change it slightly.  I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup sugar with around 3 1/2 cups of blueberries.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with the flour/sugar and 6 tablespoons of butter.  Got rave reviews from everyone.
I will definately make this again!

Very good! The dough part is sweet like cake, but this was perfect because our fruit was not very sweet. We used peaches and blackberries. I doubled the recipe, and used 1 cup of sourdough starter in place of 1 cup of flour and milk. It was delicious!

I made this yesterday morning before work, it was uber simple. I doubled the recipe and preapred in a 9*13 pan. I had all ingredients in my house and a blackberry bush on my deck that I picked from.  I would maybe toss the berries in sugar next time and then sprinkle on top.  I would like more cake, I think I overdid the fresh berries

When I read this recipe I thought it couldn't be this easy to make and be that good.  I was wrong.  This cobbler is amazing! I made a few modifications as suggested and a few of my own: doubled the recipe but only used 6 tbsp. butter and 1 cup of sugar; added 2 tsp. cinnamon to flour mixture (but use less if you are not a big cinnamon fan); added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the milk. I used 4-4 1/2 cups of cut up fresh fruit (blueberries, strawberries, peaches, and cherries).  I also made it a second time using a bag of frozen fruit (blueberries, strawberries and blackberries) which I defrosted and gently rinsed before using in recipe.  Also baked it for 50-55 min. Serve with vanilla ice cream &/or whipped cream.  It was delicious and my family loved it with the frozen fruit just as much! Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband called this "the bomb".  He loved it.  I did make a few changes out of necessity and personal preference.  First, I used Unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk in place of the regular milk.  Second, I increased the amount of fruit I used (blueberries and blackberries) to about 3 1/2 cups.  I wanted to use a pint of blueberries and a half a pint of blackberries before they went bad. Lastly, I sprinkled about 2 tbs of sugar over the top as well as a generous sprinkling of cinnamon.  My husband is completely in love with this recipe and has asked me when will I be making it again.

5 stars for ease of prep, would have only taken 10 min if I hadn't had to slice the peaches!  Crust stayed doughy in the middle, but rose to the surface and browned nicely at the edges.  I doubled the crust, used 4 cups fresh peaches and a pint of blueberries, and used a 9x13 glass casserole dish.  I used 1 tsp vanilla and about 1/2 tsp ground ginger in the crust.  Cooked a little over an hour.  Couldn't let it cook longer or the edges would have burned.  Next time will try cooking at 325 if I double the recipe so it can cook longer.  Taste was great, and I chose the perfect ratio of peaches to blueberries.

I was looking at a lot of blueberry recipes and they were so involved much more than I wanted.  I almost passed this one by it looked so simple.  It was delicious.  I did add some lemon rind to the blueberries but this recipe rocks.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Great topped with vanilla recipe

My first cobbler attempt and I succeeded! I had just a cup of blueberries and blackberries sitting in the fridge. I reduced the ingredients to half and divided the a cup of berries into two porcelain cups (i had no ramekins) tossed with some sugar and cinnamon. And topped with the batter and put then in oven. It turned out fabulously soft cakey with yummy fruit beneath it. For the lovely dessert for TWO I used 1/4 c+ 2 T of flour,sugar and skim-milk. I used melted butter flavored margarine 1 1/2 T, 1/2 t baking powder and a pinch of salt and added a tsp of ground cinnamon.
I was heavenly good with vanilla ice-cream (slightly melted). I would recommend this recipe if you are looking for a cakey soft moist cobbler.

Tasted great however the butter burned black on the bottom of my pan so I had to scrape the batter and fruit off to serve it and leave the burned layer in the pan.  I wondered at the time what would happen when I poured the batter into the pool of melted butter.  I tried to stir the melted butter into the batter as much as possible.  It could also be because I baked it in my toaster oven.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll cook it on the oven.

I've done a lot of cobblers and have to say this is one of the best.  Didn't adjust the recipe in any way - used mixed bag of dark frozen berries and - ended up having first bowl with ice cream and had to have another bowl without.  Couldn't get enough!! Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thank you.

OK What happened?  I used fresh raspberries and added a few fresh strawberries and followed the recipe exactly and my fruit stayed on top of the batter!!  Sure smells good and unless the batter is raw, I am sure I will eat it anyway or at least eat the berries.  I didn't let it cook any longer than 60 minutes because I don't think the batter would rise.  My BP is new.

I love cobblers made this way. I added 1 1/2 t. Nutmeg to the batter. I had picked 2 quarts fresh blackberries, so I added 1 cup sugar and 1 cup orange juice to those and let them sit to juice up. You can adjust the sweetness to your liking in the fruit, 1 to 2 cups sugar if needed. Turned out real good and no left overs.

I followed the exact recipe and used 2 cups of fresh blueberries. It wasn't too sweet and the batter wasn't dry. Plus it's so quick and simple to make. The four servings it makes was plenty. A serving for me and my husband and two servings to share with my inlaws. Add vanilla ice cream and it's so good. Will definitely make it again.

LOVED it!  This was SO easy to make.  When it comes out of the oven it doesn't look like much, but once you scoop some out into a dish and it mixes all together its amazing!  Cool Whip or vanilla ice cream would make it to die for.  Seriously.

I cut the butter to 2 tbsp and added 1 cup fresh cut strawberries- it took 70 minutes for batter to crisp . Very good and very easy ! Not the traditional thick crusted cobbler - more fruit than crust - thats the way we like it. Not too sweet - just perfect !

This did NOT come out as a cobbler. It's more like a spongy cake than anything. I was hoping for something crisp but no... it was very cakey and the flavor just wasn't what I wanted.
This one is really simple, but it's not what I was hoping for.

DELICIOUS!!  I've never made cobbler before but my grandfather mentioned that he had some strawberry cobbler and i just happened to have some fresh picked strawberries at the house i needed to use.  I had 4 cups so i doubled the recipe, except for the butter (only used 7 tbsp) and the 1 tbsp of sugar remained the same for a 9 x 13" pan.  I also used wheat flour (about 1 1/4 cup for a double batch).  Then cooked it for 45 minutes because my oven cooks fast.  It turned out perfectly; crispy edges & spongey cobbler center!!  I would highly recommend this recipe for an easy and delicious dessert and I will be using this one again...SOON!

I made this today, I had some blueberries and strawberries to use up.  I doubled the recipe and it was GREAT~. by far the easiest cobbler I have ever made.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  The only thing I changed was I added nutmeg and cinnamon!

Crowd pleaser! Thanks for the delicious recipe!! However, I agree with the other reviews:  add more fruit so less doughy, wouldn't call it a cobbler - because the batter is on the bottom, and use less sugar (felt guilty already with the flour) :-)  I would give it 5-stars if it was gluten free and this tasty.  :-) Load up on blackberries and blueberries and peaches - incredibly delicious.

Family loved this during a cook out. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, probably could have reduced it even more because the strawberries were ripe. Family requested to try it with apples next time. Easy, quick and yummy!

Made this with blackberries for BF's birthday last year. He LOVED it! I was super shocked at how insanely easy it was. Now whenever fresh fruit is on sale in the summer, I buy tons of it and freeze it for making cobbler in winter!

Excellent   Easy. Efficient use of time & ingredients. Def needs 3 cups of fruit. Less butter good. Vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg added to canned peaches. Scrumptious.

Perhaps the texture was off because I used a convection oven to bake, but I didn't like the edges that became butter/flour/sugar crisp enough for me to need kitchen scissors to cut through them.  My search continues for a quick baked blueberry snack.

Delicious and easy enough for busy days.  Used extra fruit; mixed berries.

Then months later I forgot about this recipe in my Recipe Box.  

I had lots of fresh fruit on hand and made this cobbler with blueberries--added a dash of cinnamon and grated lemon peel.

I love the fact that the butter is melted in the oven and you don't need to cream into the batter mixture.  How easy!

This is a go-to for a quick dessert for company or last minute coffee guests.

I'm keeping this recipe on hand while summer fruits are available.

So good! The only negative I can give, is that I didn't double the recipe! Gone in seconds! Only changes I made were, I made it with 2 1/2 cups strawberries and added vanilla extract. Served with pistachio ice cream. YUM!

I also was initially skeptical of the recipe because it just looked way too easy. Some things are not too good to be true. Being a vegan I also used soy milk and margarine and enjoyed the results thoroughly. I made mine with frozen strawberries and canned peaches to use up some extra fruits that had been around for a while. Very delicious recipe AS IS. Well done :)

super easy and a really quick dessert.  I used fresh raspberries and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top for a little extra flavour (rather than the plain white sugar), since I didn't have icecream or whipped cream on hand. A really tasty treat that serves up warm after a cold day outside. Thanks for sharing!

This was terrific!!  I made it just as stated, but used two bags of frozen peaches (home frozen, so not exactly sure of quantity).  I did have to bake it 10 minutes longer than the hour listed because my peaches were so juicy.

Absolutely delicious.  I was looking for a dessert I could use frozen blueberries in.  This fit the bill.  I wish it made more because this was so good;pretty sure it is going to completely eaten in one sitting.

FANTASTIC!!!  Needed something very last minute and had peaches and cherries in the house.  I used them both and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I probably needed to cook it a little longer since the middle seemed to be a little mushy, but everyone loved it!

This is more of a cake than a cobbler.  It doesn't produce syrupy juices or crispy crust, which is what I would expect from a cobbler.  Just OK.

So Delish. My BF made this 2 weeks ago and followed recipe exactly. It was prefect. Better than any fancy cobbler I've had. So im attempting to duplicate it myself as we speak. Wanted it to be slightly diff. He used apricots. I'm trying fresh peaches. Topping with tbsp of brown sugar and dash of cinnamon.

So easy! I doubled the recipe and made in a 9 x 13 pan. I used half brown sugar/half white and cut back slightly.  Added a tsp of vanilla.  Took all of five minutes to throw together!  Will make this again.

Very good! I used peaches and fresh cherries, added more fruit than called for (more like 4 cups), and baked it in a pie dish. I used a knife to incorporate some of the melted butter with the batter around the edges, to avoid the greasiness mentioned in some reviews. Served with whipped cream. Great for how easy it was!

I read over the reviews (the good and the bad) before making this recipe.  And after making it, I'm conflicted.  :)
Cobbler is not a dessert that I grew up with and the first I ever tasted, made by my MIL who was an awesome cook, was the type generally referred to here as "old fashioned".  That is, it was like a pie without the bottom crust.  So it was with much trepidation that I decided to try this.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe only adding some cinnamon to the peaches and small amount of blueberries that I used.  We all thought the consistency of the crust/batter? was tough and chewy around the edges as other reviewers of this type of cobbler had noted.  HOWEVER, the next day this had softened and the flavors overall had improved making this something I might actually try again with the idea of making it the day ahead of the actual time I would want to serve it.  We liked it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Simple and quick. Works with fresh fruit or frozen fruit. I prefer a less sugary treat, so used half the amount of sugar called for the second time I made it. It was still wonderful.

I used whole milk, a little over 12 oz of frozen blackberries and blueberries (did not thaw), followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. Slightly crunchy on top, moist but definitely not soggy. We all loved it. Will definitely make it again!

It was more like bread pudding than cobbler.  It tasted good, but wasn't exactly what I was looking for when I wanted cobbler.

Easy to make, but after cooling for 10 minutes out of the oven the top dough turned completely soggy. When consumed it was too greasy and soggy.  I was quite disappointed.

Super easy, super good! I used 3 cups frozen berries (blackberries, raspberries and blue berries). I had a slight "mushy-berriness" which I think would be totally eliminated with fresh fruit but it  didn't detract from the flavor at all. Will add a little vanilla to batter next time. Great recipe, thanks!

our fave cobbler.... easy as pie (and looks like one in a deep dish pie plate)! My favorite kind of recipe. Easy enough to memorize AND delicious. Love it best with wild blackberries. Yummy with strawberries. Usually our cook time is a little shorter. Substituted white sugar with brown today and it was Yum!

Used Splenda instead of sugar,and lost most of the calories. It was still sweet enough and couldn't tell the change.

This didn't do well for me.  The edges we hard and chewy, and cobbler dry.  Followed recipe to a tee.  I used raspberries, so maybe they didn't produce enough juice.

This is a great cobbler recipe; very easy!  I used peaches, strawberries and blueberries (1 cup each) - came out fantastic - didn't need any extra (ice cream/whipped cream), but if added would have been just as good.  Thank you Pam Anderson!

Oh, my gosh!! So easy and so delicious. Best cobbler I've ever made. I did something different, though. I had some leftover triple berry pie filling (about a cup or so) left from a cheesecake I made last week and I didn't want to just throw it out, so I used that in place of fresh fruit and used 3 ramekins instead of a pan. I still used the whole batter - I didn't half it or anything, although, after reading that this is a cakey cobbler, I only used half of the baking powder so that it wouldn't rise as much. It turned out perfect. The consistency of the batter after cooked was perfect - nice and soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the top. And there was a perfect balance of batter and fruit.  Everyone loved having their own little dessert, too. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!

This is an extremely easy recipe, but a few changes make it better, as others have mentioned it's better with 3+ cups of fruit.  I also add cinnamon and (because I have some) almond extract.  Really yummy.  Also, I find it goes soggy really quickly and so it is definitely best when eaten while still warm from the oven.

I used sliced nectarines and plums, did not peel them; it came out beautiful and delicious!  It forms a buttery, chewy crust. It was very quick and easy :)

We love this recipe, I have made it for family, dinner parties, and co-workers and it is fantastically versatile. Ususally we are using homegrown blackberries but i also just made a reduction of strawberry rhubarb that was great and i have made it with almond milk and oil instead of milk and butter using gluten free bisquick for a friend with multiple food allergies and it still came out fantastic, i usually have to make a double batch! Thanks for this great recipe!

was a good dessert but not what one would expect from a cobbler..  to much  liquid and an odd texture to the "crust"  which never rose to the surface...(in all fairness it could have been my baking powder.) I will be looking at other recipe's or at the very least buying new baking powder.  was very easy and did work well served with ice cream.  I used home made canned peaches and margarine,  if I try again i will reduce the "butter"  

It was good for a quick dessert and was great use of fruit.   it did take about 75 minutes to bake instead of 50-60- do be sure you have the time to bake it.

Good luck and enjoy a yummy dessert,  Just don't expect "cobbler"

Perfect when you want desert but don't want to make a trip to the store! It was delicious. I made a few modifications, first I doubled the recipe-all except the butter-(I used 2 tbs Margerine and 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavor Crisco) in a 9" round pan. I Used canned peaches, fresh blueberries and frozen Pineapple chunks--It turned out pretty and golden brown and yummy.

awesome cobbler, so easy and tasty! seems to work with many different fruits, i have used berries, peaches, and even frozen pie cherries - 8" square pan - always comes out great. (i might have put a bit less butter than the recipe calls for.) served it with fresh whipped cream! i like this better than "easy fruit cobbler" on this site. i recommend trying this - thanks for the recipe!

this was my first time baking anything from scratch, this recipe seemed easy enough and it was! i used fresh strawberries and pineapple chunks. i took some of the others advice and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon into the batter. i think the batter is my favorite part!! delicious! i also added the extra cup of fruit which i dont think i will do next time. i think the extra fruit overpowers the batter. but thats just for my taste. next time i wont be using the pineapple chunks because they came out too chunky, maybe slices? or peaches. and i will double the batter since i loved it so much. anyway this is a winner in my book. i love it.

Made exactly as written, but with a few extra strawberries to completely cover the top.  Loved it!  It was so good warm, that we ate the whole pan!  Will definitely make a double-batch next time.

Simple enough to make while preparing dinner.  I didn't have any problems with the dough as some reported.  I did use a little over 3 cups of berries though.  Also used lighter options for the milk, butter, & sugar.  Turned out great - quickly gobbled up.

Good recipe, and very easy as stated.  I made a mixed berry cobbler with this recipe.  I did add more fruit (almost double), but that was just personal preference.

Pretty easy, and marvelous!  I doubled all of the ingredients, except for the fruit, which I tripled, and I used a 9x13 pan.  I used frozen cherries, blueberries, and raspberries.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, based on other reviews.  It ended up taking about 65 minutes to be done, but it was fantastic!

This recipe was so simple.  I used a 12" oval porcelein au gratin baking dish and used more fruit than the recipe called for (4 peaches and a pint of blueberries) and it came out perfectly and beautifully.  So easy!  It was a big hit for a 4th of July BBQ.  Because I used so much fruit, I probably should have used more batter, but my guests thought it was perfect proportions.

I followed others' tips and cut the butter to 3 tablespoons and added vanilla, also used closer to 3 cups of berries. I've made this with blueberries and also with a mix of blackberries/raspberries - delicious both times. And so easy!

4.5 Stars: This was easy and delicious. I grew up with cobblers made with a sweetened piecrust as the dough and this is the cake-type.

This was so delicious and could not have been easier.  I used frozen mixed berries and brown sugar instead of white on top.  SO YUMMY!!  My boyfriend thought I'd been baking all day.  Little does he know it took 5 minutes to put together!

First of all it was not so good. BUT I just realized I wrote the recipe down wrong. I used 2 CUPS of milk instead of 3/4 cups, I knew something was wrong but never went to check the website again. I don't know if I will try it again or not. I gave it 3 stars only because I made it wrong and it is probably good when made right. LOL Also I used the frozen mixed berries and that alone with vanilla ice cream is great!

I don't typically leave reviews, but considering how good this was even with the modifications, I figured I should share. I substituted the following (all same measurements: coconut oil for butter; whole wheat a-p flour for a-p flour; Splenda for sugar. I also added vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested.  I added a pint of fresh blueberries and sprinkled some raw sugar on the top.  Suprisingly, it tasted really very delicious, especially with a scoop of Breyers sugar-free vanilla ice cream!  I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was extremely sweet and slightly tart...may be due to the Splenda.

This was great! I felt like a Champion Baker! I did add a tsp of vanilla and I always bake with Splenda for Baking. Oh, and I used brown sugar for the top sprinkle. Oh, yummy, yum, yum!

Maybe it is because I seldom use butter, and do not use much sugar, but for me the cobbler was all about these two ingredients (and I already cut them down). It turned out fine (wasn't soggy), but was greasy and lacked in flavor. I ended up picking the strawberries and eating them with yogurt. I only give it two stars because I spent no more than 10 minutes in the kitchen.

This is so easy. I lightened it up a bit by using only 1/4 c sugar and 1/2 c Sugar Twin for baking.  Don't add extra fruit or the recipe can get soggy.  Easy and tasty.

This was terrific, easy and fast to put together. I used frozen mixed berries, and added a tsp or so of maple syrup and found the recipe worked perfectly. I highly recommend pairing this with vanilla ice cream!

It tends to get a bake a little drier and there isn't as much filling as I usually like in cobbler so I try to use more fruit.  Awesome taste!

Absolutely delicious-fluffy and moist! The only thing I did differently was add a dash of vanilla extract. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly with great results. I think that so much butter is unneeded, but certainly doesn't hurt!

Very easy to make and tastes great!  I recently made a raspberry cobbler with this recipe and everyone loved it! Saved it to my recipe box to make again.  I made 8 servings instead of 4 and used a 9 X 13 pan. Came out perfect.

This is a great recipe!  You can use canned cherries  and here is what I did:  1 can 14.5 pitted red tart cherries in water (drained).  I also added several drops of vanilla extract to the batter.  It turned out to be more of a cherry cake.  (To me a cobbler should be more syrupy.)  I served it with whipped cream but I bet it would be heavenly with vanilla ice cream.

Simply put, my husband said this is THE BEST dessert I've ever made (and I've been baking for MANY years and have made some pretty spectacular desserts)! It certainly was one of the eastiest, as well. I used nectarines and blueberries - it was absolutely delicious. One of the things I loved about this recipe is that it makes a relatively small amount (there are only two of us) - most recipes seem to call for a 9" x 13" pan. I served it with whipped cream the first time and when we ran out of that he started adding vanilla ice cream. Either way, it's delicious. Thanks for posting, Pam!

I love this and it is so easy.  I picked fresh apples and prepared them for a pie (the sugar & cinnamon) and used those in the cobbler.  This also makes a good breakfast.  I just love it.

This recipe is amazing.  I had some peaches and nectarines left from camping that had been a little bruised in their travels.  I cut them up and sprinkled over the batter as well as some mixed berries. We served it warm over ice-cream and it was a hit!  My company asked for the recipe and I gladly gave them a copy.  It will be a favorite in this house for a long time I am sure!

This is by far, the easiest and yummiest cobbler recipe I have ever tried! I made a peach and blueberry one but I tweeked it a bit and used Splenda Blend instead of all white sugar, and you couldn't tell the difference.  Fantastic!

OMG! This was too easy for how delicious it was. If you are on a diet, don't make this. It is excellent (and so easy).

This recipe lives up to its title and reviews.  It was extremely easy.  It also doesn't make a lot.  Next time I might double the recipe so it lasts longer!  Tried it with peaces and blackberries the first time.  I have some fresh frozen strawberries that I'll try the next time.

This is simply the best cobbler recipe ever.  It is SO easy and comes out great every single time I make it.  My only change is I add cinnamon to the batter.  I've done it with peaches, blueberries, strawberries, and frozen mixed berries.  It always tastes so good.  You don't even need ice cream!

Easy and delicious.  A great basic cobbler recipe that let the fresh blueberries I picked take center stage.  Accented nicely by ice cream on top.  Everyone raved about it.

Love Love it!!!!  I had a recipe like this one a long time ago that came from a newspaper article and i have misplaced it over the years.  It is absolutely the easiest and most versatile recipe there is for cobbler.  I've made strawberry/blueberry, blueberry and fresh peach.  The flavor is really yummy.  Thank you for posting it!!  I have given the recipe to many people since I ran across it.

DELICIOUS!!  This is super easy to make and everyone loves it! I use frozen berries and have tried it with blueberries, blackberries and strawberries.  I increase the sugar in the batter to 1 cup b/c I like my cobbler sweet.  I also sprinkle more than 1 tablespoon of sugar on top.   This is a definite keeper!

Aug 1, 2010 - I used 3 cups of fruit overall, peaches and blueberries, and thought this was really good.  I thought it tasted better and had a fuller flavor after a night in the fridge.  I will use this recipe again.  ****updated review Aug 10, 2010 - I have now made this 4 times.  I decreased the amount of fruit I used from the first batch I made to around 2.5 cups and I liked it better that way.  I added a splash of vanilla b/c that's what I do.  I've now also made a just peach one (I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to that), a peach and blackberry one and a blueberry, strawberry and blackberry one.  They have all been excellent and honestly, I'll be making another one this weekend!

I don't usually rate recipes, although I love almost everything I have tried on this site.  But, I have to rate this one.  I would have given it 10 stars if I could.  It was so easy and so wonderful.  4 of us finished off the pan pretty easily.  I read some reviews that said it was too sweet, but mine was not sweet at all.  I did put a bit less sugar in, but not a certain amount less, I just didn't put the sugar to the top of the measuring cup.  I will be making this again and again.  My husband calls me the dessert queen and this one didn't disappoint anyone!!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Oh my goodness! Are you kidding me??  Something this easy shouldn't be this yummy!  I made it with just blueberries, but next time I will probably do a mixture of peaches and something else.  I did use a little less butter, maybe around 3 TBSP and it was fabulous!

I grew up with this recipe.  In our household it was know as "Ho's Cobbler", I have no idea where that name origioned from... It was the dessert that dad would make, generally with sliced up apples.  I only differece I can think of is our recipe included cinnamon and didn't have the sugar sprinkled on top.  Great all the time!

This was AMAZINGLY easy to make. I don't usually like to bake because everything has to be so exact but you would be hard pressed to mess this up.  I made it exactly as it said with nectarines and blueberries and can't wait to try it with other fruits.

Very easy.  Made with a combination of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  Would decrease the amount of butter next time because the bottom of the crust was kind of greasy.  Great warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I used a combination of peaches and blueberries and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  My fruit was not as sweet as it could have been, but I think this made the end result just the right amout of sweetness.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough!  I've been asked to make this again soon!

Incredibly easy batter. Compliments any fruit combination. I had fresh raspberries and blueberries in my yard this time. Next time I might try red currants and strawberries. The sky's the limit with this batter!

It was good but not the best I have ever had...just lacked the "something special" factor for me.  Just the very best ones go back in the the recipe box for me. I think it definitely at least needs to missing spices like cinnamon and or nutmeg.

I added 3 C. black raspberries as someone suggested.  I think it was too much fruit, and too little cake.  Try adding only 2 C. of fruit next time.

I made a fresh peach cobbler that was absolutely delisious!  The only alterations were to cut the butter to 3 Tbs., add 1 tea. vanilla, 1/2 tea. cinnamon and 1/8 ginger.  My husband said it was his favorite dessert.

I forgot the extra sugar on top but it was still delicious. Used up a bunch of never-gonna-really-ripen peaches (peeled). Will do again!

This was just ok for us.  It was easy that is for sure, but it is not like a traditional cobbler.  I thought the batter was sweet enough, but I didn't think the fruit part was sweet enough.  I also thought it was weird that there was no cinnamon or nutmeg in it so I added it.  Thanks for sharing.

It's more like bread pudding than cobbler but tasty non the less. You can definitely get away with less butter.

Very Easy, very fast, very good! Followed recipe using fresh Blackberries and fresh Strawberries. Served with a dollop of whipped cream and a few fresh berries and it was a perfect cobbler. Thanks for sharing!
Update - 6/30/10 - Prepared with fresh Eastern Shore Peaches and Blackberries and it was perfect again. We love this recipe!

When I first tried this recipe I didn't like the results but the second time around it rates 5 stars! I took it to a carry-in and it got rave reviews. For a double batch (13 x 9) I reduced the butter by 3 T and the sugar by 1/4 cup. I couldn't find fresh peaches so I used two 29 oz. cans of freestone sliced peaches (sliced an additional time as the slices were pretty thick) and 1 cup fresh blueberries. Drained the peaches but reserved about 2/3 cup of heavy syrup to add back to the fruit mixture and also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I was worried it wouldn't get done in time for the carry-in so I warmed the milk in the microwave before adding it to the batter. It was done in 50 minutes.

Very easy and tasty. If you want a quick solution for cobbler, this is the way to go and a great way to use up those berries. I used blackberries and a few strawberries. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. It was okay, but I will leave it out the next time.

I would call this easy fruit bread pudding.  The batter cooked up with  the consistency of bread pudding.  This a keeper, very easy to throw together.

This was so easy and it was so good!! The only thing I noticed was the edge got a little too done... next time will put foil around the edge when it starts to brown. My boyfriend even ate it for breakfast this morning before work!! Thank you for such an easy, but delicious recipe!! Side note: It is even delicious with blueberries!!

So incredibly easy and delicious.  I even made it with Splenda and reduced fat butter and you couldn't tell the difference at all.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was super easy, and super yummy, everyone wanted me to make another the same night!  The only problem I had was that it took much longer to cook in my oven, but when done, is worth the wait.

This was amazing!  I just happened to have two cups of fresh blueberries in the fridge and they worked great!  Substituted Splenda for sugar to try to cut down on the calories and you couldn't tell at all.  Concerned that the batter was very runny but in the end it all baked up superbly and  my husband and I enjoyed for this evening's dessert and will enjoy again several more times this week.

I really liked this recipe just as it is written.   I used blackberries, and it capped off our Christmas Eve casual dinner and game night perfectly.  I made it after dinner, and it cooked while we had fun.  Served it with vanlla ice cream, and it was great.  I probably would use more berries next time (husband says a cobbler needs more fruit), bt I loved the taste of the light cake around the berries.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is an amazing, delicious cobbler.  my family goes crazy for it, and it never lasts longer than about 2 hours after I make it.  I've also frozen this after I cooked it, then thawed it on the counter--great as is or warmed up in the oven.  Love having this in my freezer ready to go!

This recipe has great potential.  I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of fruit I wanted to use.  It did not  cook properly, even though I left it in the oven 30 minutes longer.  Next time I will double the fruit, but nothing else.

Great dessert for a small group - and so easy to be so good !  It's hard to find dessert recipes for 4-6 people so this was perfect for me. I used frozen blueberries and dusted them with flour before using.  I also added 1 Tblsp.  Passion Fruit Butter Spread that I had available.  Thanks for the great recipe - it's in my file for sure !

Love it!! Takes minutes to put together...the hardest part is the wait! my son loves this. We've tried many different combination of fruit and using a mix of frozen blueberries and raspberries is our favorite. Oh! last time I used brown sugar instead of white and sprinkled 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar(sugar we have vanilla beans in to flavor).

This is a perfect fast and easy dessert.  I used two cups of frozen blueberries and just extended the baking time. I know I'll be making this many times in the future.

I have made this a dozen times and it is always excellent.  I try to make this a little healthier by omitting the butter.  I use non-stick cooking spray to get it out of the pan easily.  I have also used Splenda instead of sugar a few times and it still tastes great.  I usually double it and I make sure I have extra fruit.  Delicious!

I'm giving this five stars because of ease alone.  What a delicious, impressive dessert to literally be able to whip together in less than 10 min.  I made some adjustments- I doubled the recipe then only used 3/4 of the sugar called for and thought this was plenty.  Next time, I will reduce it even more, since I use fresh fruit and serve it with ice cream, both of which add sweet.  I added a cap of vanilla and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  I only used 3 tbsp as recommended by another reviewer and even though I doubled the recipe, I still thought I could use less next time.  Overall taste and ease of preparation earn this recipe five stars.  You'll memorize this one- so easy and wonderful!

I doubled the recipe, used fresh raspberries and frozen peaches.  It was good, very cakey, probably best served with an ice cream or homemade whipped cream.  Best to eat in one day, ok on day two very soggy thereafter.

Delish.  I added cinnamon and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I am sure it would taste great with just white sugar but I love the taste of  brown sugar.

Loved this recipe. So easy I couldn't believe it. The butter amount was PERFECT, do not reduce. The batter folded into itself and then folded the raspberries in as well. This has ended up a family fav!

I thought this was great- and truly, it doesn't get any easier! I used 2 fresh peaches and about a cup of frozen blueberries, and it turned out beautifully! The only thing I did differently was to add anout 1/2 t of vanilla extract. Really good- this will be my go-to dessert when I have fruit to use and not a lot of time!

Fantastic and easy!  I doubled the fruit over all, proportions were: 1/2 peaches 1/4 raspberries and 1/4 blackberries.  It was a huge hit, even my father-in-law asked for seconds and he is picky about his cobblers! As others suggested, I used half brown sugar and half white.  Added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Also stirred the fruit in 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp sugar before adding, but I'm sure this is optional.  For those who got a mushy bottom, I believe it simply was not baked long enough. I let it bake longer than instructed, and pressed my finger in the cake part in the center to make sure it was firm. This is a winner!

Great cobbler recipe. I used all blueberries and it had the perfect consistency - not too watery. Thicker, cake like crust as compared to regular cobbler. It was also not too sweet. I made this one with soy milk because I was out of regular milk. Super easy.

Absolutely delicious!  So easy and a great way to use very ripe (you know what I mean) fruit.  I used nectarines and mixed a little cinnamon with the fruit for a extra flavor. It was devoured by both adults and children!

I made this as directed. Everyone enjoyed it but I'm not completely sold on it. The batter seemed a bit like a sweet pancake (which isn't a bad thing) but I will probably add more blueberries next time.  The simplicity and quickness of this recipe make it worth doing again.

Good flavor, but didn't love the texture.  It was very chewy around the edges.  Made with blueberries; would decrease to 1 or 1 1/2 C. of fruit next time.

Excellent taste, definitely a winner at our house. I only took off a point for presentation. It's just not something I would serve guests because it's not very impressive looking. But the taste is fantastic, the batter yeilds a great crust on top, and mixes with the rest of the fruit (which by the way is supposed to sink to the bottom)creating a yummy gooey sweet fruit mixture. I added a Tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter. The cinnamon was a great addition because it complimented the (frozen) blueberries I used nicely. I did mix some flour with the blueberries before I added to the batter, just to soak up any extra moisture. The butter does look a bit scary at first, but completely disappears once it's done cooking. Only took 40 minutes in the oven. This is so easy, i'm sure it will be a staple in our house.

This tasted really good, but I was a little disappointed that the breading was soggy since I'm used to drier/breadier cobblers. I used strawberries, cutting the large ones in half and leaving the rest whole. I should've cut the butter in half because I ended up sopping up butter puddles. I added 1tsp of vanilla, and 1/2tsp almond extract. The almond tasted excellent. The presentation wasn't that great, but I think that was because of the cooked strawberries. I might try this again with different fruits, but the verdict is still out for this recipe.

This was easy. I followed the recipe to a T. Used two cups fresh blueberries. My boyfriend and I thought it was good, but not fantastic. He thought it should be sweeter and juicier, based on his experience with frozen cobblers. I felt like something was off...not sure what would make it better but I know my mama's cobbler is sooo good, and this wasn't like hers.

This is easy, fast and a good way to use up fresh berries (I used leftover fresh raspberries!). I did change it though, I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. Glad I did, think it would have been missing something otherwise. Also used part brown sugar and part white, don't know why, just for fun!

Made this last week with blueberries and strawberries. I added vanilla and nutmeg, as suggested in the other reviews. It certainly was easy, but I was disappointed by the flavor (blah) and the texture (too soft and spongy). I will continue to search for another cobbler recipe.

Good! The end result is not very cobbler-like in its consistency (more cake like) but is very tasty, especially with some Cool Whip on the side. I used a mixture of peaches, strawberries (sliced) and blueberries (all fresh, not frozen). I also sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of white. I baked mine for 55 minutes in a 8x8 pan. Will make again - thanks for sharing.

It's super simple, very quick and if you have a little ice cream that will really make it rock. It's fine on it's own too, served with a nice coffee of some kind. The other reviewers are correct, it's incredibly sweet. I used frozen blueberries, but they were fresh blueberries I'd just shoved in the freezer and forgotten about. I also halved the recipe. I think the butter amount can be cut in half without issue, same with the sugar, it's extremely sweet. My dough came out gooey, even after an hour of cooking. I blame the butter and the baking dish, possibly the baker as well (some recipes just don't halve well). But I did follow the recipe exactly (except for the fact that I halved it). Still worth the 5 stars.

Amazed at how great this came out!  Even with the good reviews, I still wasn't expecting it to be as delicious and easy as it was!  As well, I made using whole wheat flour and blueberries.  Cannot wait to try it with strawberries!

This was so delicious.  I don't know if it was the freshly picked blueberries I used or what.  But man - my family ate it up!  I used about 2 T sugar for the top - mostly because I had 4.5 lbs of blueberries to use up and probably doubled the amount of berries called for.  I will make this again and again!  It is particularly tasty with warm with whipped cream.

I loved how simple this was to put together and would do again if in a rush. The butter lookes scarey after you pour everything on top of it, but it all seems to work out okay.  I don't give it a 4-stars because the baked part was too light of a cake for me and not crisy enough.  When it cooled, it really became gooey and unappealing to eat leftovers (I made mine with peaches & blueberries)

Oh my goodness...it was so easy, and a perfect dessert if you are in a hurry..I had some nectarines that were on the verge of "not to eat fresh" but I used them in this crazy easy dessert,  with a little touch of vanilla in the batter, and a little spice worked in with the sugar to top the fruit...um...um... good, who would have thought something so simple could be do delicious...

This gets 5 stars for being easy, few ingredients, and delicious taste. Especially the edges pieces, they get caramelized and yummy. I might only add a little cinnamon to the sugar sprinkle on top.

This did not turn out as I expected,  It was very tasty, but would only serve 2 people. Maybe my baking powder was not good. Maybe I will try it again, There was  only crust around the edges and the rest was fruit. I have looked over and over at the recipe and can not figure what I did wrong.I did use 3 cups of blueberries, as suggested.

I think the 4.5 current rating makes sense - I'd give it a 4 for taste (it was a teeny bit bland for me), but definitely a 5 for easy prep!!

It's easy, delicious and versatile - works for me! I used 3 cups of raspberries, less would have made it more cake-y. Thought the batter was good, I reduced the butter by a little and mixed wheat flour in with the white. I served it in a 9.5 inch pie plate instead of a square baking pan.

This was very similar to a recipe I have called "Crazy Crust Apple Pie". This was so flavorful and very simple & fast to put together. A great recipe to keep when you need a quick dessert or an easy way to use up some of that excess fruit. Definately a keeper!

So easy and so yummy!  I used fresh blueberries and following reviewers' recommendations about decreasing sugar and butter.  We had friends over for a swim party, so I mixed all the dry ingredients earlier in the day and then right before dinner I added milk and vanilla and let it cook while we ate.  Will definitely make this again.

Followed directions, but pulled out of the oven after 45 minutes since the top and edges were browned. I used 2 cups raspberries and 1 cup blueberries. This is an easy and yummy dessert, I did not have any leftovers. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. This recipe is a keeper. So yummy!

Wow! This is so easy and Delicious! I added vanilla extract and apple pie spice to the batter. I used frozen mixed berries, defrosted. I put half the sugar in the batter and half with the berries. Couldn't have been easier! Thank you for an awesome recipe! A keeper for sure! *You could reduce the butter for health reasons, but its fine with the stated amount. Yum!

I don't know why I had it in mind that this would turn out crunchy but it doesn't.  It was very moist and cake-like.  Baked it for 50 minutes and it turned out beautifully.  VERY easy.

My neighbor gave me a huge bag of peaches the day before I was leaving for a vacation.  I wanted some quick and easy recipes to use the peaches (without having to go to the grocery store since we were leaving).  This was a very nice and easy recipe.

This certainly was super easy!  The flavor was fine - really let the blueberries shine, the texture was a bit spongy.  I will try another recipe, but will keep this for a really fast prep.

I didn't think it was anything special, but it was VERY easy and everyone else absolutely LOVED it. I did forget to add the sugar on top... and then forgot to serve it(lol), so it wasn't warm. Warm crusty might've made the difference. Yummy easy way to use fresh blueberries.

I was amazed at just how simple this is and how delicious it turned out to be with the fresh blue berries we had on hand. The three of us finished off the whole thing in one sitting! Totally basic recipe that would be very hard to screw up! Perfect right out of the oven topped with some whip cream!

I followed recipe exactly up to the sugar topping.  There I used cinnamon sugar and just sprinkled a light dusting over the fresh peaches.  It was a super easy recipe and produced wonderful results.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Love this recipe. It's so easy to assemble! I've tried it with a mixture of fruit and also all the same fruit. Either way, it's always tasty. I made it last minute for dinner guests the other night and everyone raved. This will be a dessert staple - so easy!

This reciepe I have to say is awesome!  I did not change a thing and it turned out great.  I used blueberries as my fruit of choice and my whole family loved it. I  served it warm, out of the oven with vanilla ice cream and home made whip cream.  You don't need to alter anything if using blueberries!!

really enjoyed this recipe not sure what a traditional 'cobbler' should be like as from the uk. Used a little less fruit (raspberries) than the recipe suggested but it still seemed like it could do with a bit more of the batter although i think this was due to the strong and soggy nature of the fruit which soaked into it. Yummy though

I made it the evening before (using blueberries & rhubarb) and had it for breakfast.  I was skeptical when I read the recipe, but it had so many good reviews, I went ahead with it.  The batter was greasy and sticky without much flavor.  The fruit to batter ratio is way off (needs to be more.)  There are so many better easy cobbler recipes out there.  I give this 2 stars only because it was edible.

Very yummy.  I made it with fresh blueberries.  I followed the instructions exactly.  The top was very brown after only 40 min, although the inside was slightly underdone.  I used an 8x8 pan.  Maybe I will try a larger dish for next time.  I loved the salty/buttery taste, so I wouldn't reduce the butter amount.  It isn't very sweet (at least when made with blueberries) so it's great with ice cream.  Many have said the center is gooey, but it didn't bother me since I was expecting it to be different than traditional cobbler.  Great, easy recipe!

Very yummy and super easy to make and ever better, few ingredients needed. I had to add a little more milk to mine to get the batter right, and substituted 1/4c sugar with brown sugar because I ran out. Still turned out fab! It's a little more cake-y than what I usually make, but easy and yummy. Perfect for some last minute guests or a quick dessert after dinner.

I used blueberries from New Jersey so it really needed some more sugar. If I make it again I'll use different blueberries, maybe add more sugar and cut back on the butter, was too much.

Simple, sweet, and easy to make.  Used fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries.  Still too buttery, even after reducing to 3 Tbs. Will make again with even less butter and more fruit.

I followed the recipe except reducing the butter by 1 Tbsp.  The texture was not what I expected.  It was spongy/chewy but my colleagues liked it.  I wouldn't make this again but gave it 3 stars since folks at work ate it.

Easy and delicious.  I used a mix of peaches and strawberries.  I read some of the reviews after I made this recipe and I think when I make this again, I might try adding the vanilla and cinnamon. Nice touch.  Kids and hubby liked it too.

5 stars for this definitely being easy! And its taste right out of the oven is wonderful. However, it loses a star due to it becoming soggy after a couple of hours. It still tasted alright, but the sogginess definitely took away from the dish. Perhaps, next time I try this I'll cut the butter on the bottom.

This cobbler was okay.  I followed other people's suggestions and cut back to 3 T. butter and increased the fruit to 3 C. I ended up having extra sliced peaches left over b/c 3 C. was too much.  I also didn't find the texture or taste of this cobbler to be very satisfying.  I added brown sugar to the top before baking, but it didn't make much difference as far as improving the taste.  I won't make this again.  I will find a better recipe.

Not great other than the fact that any berry bake has got to be good. The 'crust' was so sugary that it was like really chewy and not like cobbler at all.

This is super easy to make and very tasty. I used mostly strawberries and a little blackberries. Next time I will use tarter fruit because the strawberries made it a litte too sweet for me.

Very quick and simple. I used very firm, tart peachs and added about an 1/8 tsp. vanilla to the batter mix. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the peaches. It was a hit with everyone! Tried this again tonight this time I used fresh raspberries and a little orange zest in the batter. This is a keeper!

Really good and easy! I would recommend using two tablespoons of butter instead of four. Strawberries tasted great in it.

This was ok, but the batter was not what I was looking for. It is too dry and sticky sweet, and needs something else. I would prefer something closer to pie crust or biscuits. I should have been able to tell that when I read the recipe though.

Pretty good!  I used 1 c of Splenda instead of sugar, frozen berry blend (blackberries, blueberries & raspberries) and sprinkled raw sugar on top.  This doesn't make very much so next time I'll definitely double and I'll probably try different fruit.  Overall you can't beat the super fast prep time for a hot homemade dessert!

I made this recipe as is and used fresh blackberries. WOW. Perfect blend of fruit and cake, crispy around the edges and surprisingly light.  I don't normally eat two servings of anything.....but I did this time. And sooo easy.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan and baked for about 5 minutes longer.  I did 1/2 with strawberries and the other half with blueberries because my husband was grossed out by the idea of a strawberry cobbler.  The strawberry was delicious and we fought over the last piece.  We thought the batter and fruit was well portioned contrary to other reviewers.  Thank you for the recipe!

Super easy to throw together.  I used blueberries.  I doubled the recipe, but only used 6 T. butter instead of 8.  Since I doubled it, I baked it in a 9x13 dish.  It was done in 50 minutes.

Very Easy. The only thing I didn't like was that it takes so long to cook. I didn't have white granulated sugar so I used 1 1/6 cups of powdered sugar. Though,I did have a tbsp of white sugar to sprinkle on top.

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe (without reading any reviews) and it was great! I'd give five stars just on ease of prep alone but the taste was really good as well.  How nice to have a home baked dessert on a weeknight.  Great way to use up last summer's berries from the freezer.

This was absolutely fantastic! I've never made anything like this before, and it was so yummy. I used strawberries and they weren't too tart... next time I will use less sugar though, as so much is NOT good for you. Especially if you plan to make it often, like me! - I would cut back on the butter too, I used 4 tbs the first time and it was a bit too rich, the last time I used 3 tbs margarine and it was fine!

This cobbler was fun and easy to make. I used canned peaches, chopping before adding to the dough. It tastes as good as Mom Hatter's cobbler from years ago. Made recipe as states, except I accidentally used 5 Tbsp of butter and baked it 65 minutes. Will make again with other fruits.

Ok, so this was actually one of the best things I have ever had, but I only gave it 4 stars because I modified things a little. I added the "crumb topping for pies" to the top of this once it was done which is what made it absolutely over the top wonderful. I just broiled it on low until it was lightly browned and the butter was melted. It was simply amazing!!! I will definitely make again. I used a frozen bag of blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Served with vanilla ice cream. Divine!

this is delicious! my boyfriend almost ate the whole thing in one sitting! LOL.  the only thing that happened was that the strawberries ended up sinking into the batter a minute after taking it out of the oven...  did i do something wrong here or did it happen to everyone?  [the only thing i did differently was used a bigger pan]

Very easy to prepare.  I doubled the recipe and used fresh peaches.  I also added a dash of nutmeg to the batter.  It will work great with any fruit.  My husband raved about it and topped it with french vanilla ice cream.  My son also made this recipe and topped it with whipped cream.

This was quick and easy! I used blueberries and it was the perfect end to supper. I will definately try this with other fruits. I am anxious to try peaches.

This is good and truly easy to make.  I took another reviewer's advice and added an extra cup of fruit.  I don't think it would have been nearly as good without it.  If you get under-ripe peaches, as the frozen ones I had were, you'll need about 15 minutes more cooking time to make them tender.  I had to foil cover the dish at this point to keep it from burning.

Finally. I've probably tried making a fruit cobbler/crisp about 20 times. I never seemed to get it right. With this recipe, it finally came out right. And it didn't even need whipped cream or ice cream. One of the keys to using frozen fruit was thawing it in microwave, draining the excess water, then measuring the 2 cups. Added a little vanilla extract and cinnamon, but other than that it turned out just like the recipe says. Great recipe. It's in the recipe box from now on.

I love this recipe! My husband requests it often.  I dont think that there is too much butter.  It has never come out greasy when I have made it.  I always make it in a glass ten inch pie plate.  The top always comes out dark golden brown with crispy edges, and the fruit is always perfectly done.  I have made this with cherries, berries, apples, even canned and frozen fruit and it comes out sweet and delicious every time!

Super easy! I made mine with peaches and blueberries because they were on sale that week. I thought it came out more like a cake than a cobbler because it is more like a dough with fruit in it than fruit with a dough topping. Never the less it makes a very delicious breakfast item.

I found this recipe a few months ago when I had a HUGE store of frozen strawberries and blackberries (leftovers from a smoothie-themed party). I made two, planning to have my 5 housemates eat one and take to work... but I had to make another one an hour later after my housemates devoured BOTH! This recipe is really easy and comes out somewhat cakey and fluffy, which I enjoy (it's almost like a thick fruit pancake). I made a dozen cobblers in a few days for my coworkers, friends, and my mom and they were all very appreciative of this recipe

This was really good and so easy to make, so it gets 5 stars from me.  I used a cup each of fresh raspberries and blueberries.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and I added a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter.  I also reduced the sugar by about 2 tablespoons.  It would have been too sweet otherwise.  Will definitely make this again.

WOW!!! I printed up this recipe on the 21st of Nov, and I have made it SEVERAL times now. The first time I used peaches. The 2nd time I used cranberry sauce ( oh my goodness! Yummy! My niece's and my favorite! ). The third I used some frozen strawberries and cranberry sauce. The last few times I used apples cooked with sugar and cinnamon. This is my husband's favorite. I add more fruit - I don't measure, just wing it and put in what looks good to me. Also, I add brown sugar on top as well as the white sugar - makes the top crust crispier. I cook longer than the time given to make it more crisp. I do double. The only bad thing is the next day the leftover cobbler does soften, but honestly, it is still delicious. Top with whipped cream and it is heavenly!

Easy, tasty...  What more can I say?  I whipped this one up on a whim and served it with vanilla ice cream and homemade whipped cream.  It was a huge hit with my picky family.  I used a bag of frozen triple berry mix and then used a paper towel to get some of the excess moisture off the top at the end.  It wasn't soggy at all, though.

This was soo easy and really good.  I'm not too keen on cooked peaches(hence the four stars) but my husband and kid really loved it.  I am going to have to try with berries, should be REALLY GOOD! I was thinking strawberries maybe with pineapple or how about bananas?  Has anyone else experimented different fruits?

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan, and I used seven peaches and 1/2 cup of blueberries (i.e. I packed the dish full of fruit). I baked it for 70 minutes. My bf said "I've never had anything like this, and it is so awesome."

Came out more like a cake than a cobbler.  I only used 2 Tbs butter and 1/2 cup sugar.  For fruit, I used sweet plums and tart nectarines.  It tasted okay and was better topped with vanilla ice cream.

The photo doesn't do this recipe justice. Loved the ease of making and short of amount of time required. I used 2 large peaches and about 1 cup of fresh blueberries and the result was devine. Great cakey crust and crispy on top, especially with sprinkled sugar on top.

This was easy to make and the taste was pretty good.  I used a combination of strawberries and blueberries and added a little lemon juice to the berries and the zest of one lemon which really made a difference.

Fantastic!!!! You do need to reduce sugar though & add more fruit. I used 1/2c sugar (but if using tart apples I'd probably leave as is) & used 4c fruit (3c peaches & 1c raspberries). I did use others suggestions about the tsp of vanilla & sprinkle top with cinnamon. It was good both warm & cold.

Love this recipe!  I have made it a number of times--mostly with blueberries and peaches.  I usually add some extra fruit as suggested and a little vanilla, nutmeg and sometimes cinnamon.  It is so so good and really easy.  Right now I've got it in the oven with bing cherries and blueberries.

This was good, but nothing special. I found the cobbler had a somewhat gloppy consistency. I used fresh nectarines and frozen blueberries, which was a great combo, and cut the oil to 2 T. I'd also recommend adding 1 tsp. vanilla.

This recipe was good, but I forgot to add vanilla to the batter as the other posts suggested.  I just found that the base had something missing, a little bland.  It did get all eaten up pretty quick.

Yummy. Made it on the fly when an unexpected dinner party came up. Very Good! Used Blueberries and White Nectarines. It did not turn out too sweet but would recommend using yellow flesh Nectarines as opposed to the white so the tartness of the yellow variety may help balance the sweetness of the dish as a whole. Very easy and very minimal clean up. A definate staple!

Loved it the first time I made it for myself using blueberries. Made some changes for my diabetic family using Splenda in place of sugar and used previous suggestions using vanilla and cinnamon. It doesn't rise as well as using regular sugar but it was a hit. Lasted less than 24 hours. I plan on using this recipe lots this summer.

I really liked this.  I halved the recipe and made it in two small heart shaped pans, other then that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was cute and tasty.

Wasn't so sure about this as I was making it, but it turned out very good! Some butter browned before the rest was totally melted in the pan , and the batter seemed very thin going in the oven... but good end result. It was done before the time was up. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13. It had a nice crispy/golden brown crust on top.

Great and so easy!! Made some small changes as others suggested: only used 2 T. butter, decreased the sugar a little, used 2 1/2 cups freshly picked strawberries, and added a little vanilla and cinnamon. Served it with vanilla ice cream right out of the oven and it was gone in minutes. Will have to make more tomorrow! The kids loved it! I'd highly suggest trying it.

Fantastic! so easy to prepare and the whole house smelled fabulous as it was in the oven.  I did add some cinnamon on top of the cobbler before setting it in the oven, making it even better.  Will be making again!

Really great cobbler recipe, super tasty.  I used 2 and 1/2 cups of strawberries and blackberries and i think next time i will skip the extra tablespoon of sugar that goes on top.

Excellent, very easy and very forgiving.  I ran out of sugar and had to use brown sugar for more than half of the recipe, and I only had a 9 inch round pan, and it turned out GREAT!  Tasted a bit like pineapple upside down cake with raspberries (I used 2 cups fresh and extra brown sugar on top since they were really sour).

Delicious..I don't ever recall having eaten cobbler before so I have nothing to compare it to. But the taste and texture were great. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries  and put a dollop of cool whip on top. I will make this again.

This recipe was so quick and easy! I had my nine year old step daughter do it on her own (with help for the oven part) and it turned out great! Not the best tasting cobbler ever, but the ease of the recipe really makes up for it.

This was great - I had frozen strawberries in the freezer, and have been wanting to use them up. This was great. However, the cake part of it was a bit overcooked (but i think that was my fault).

I made this dessert for a potluck and it was a great hit!  I doubled up the recipe to make in a 9" X 13" pan, used raspberries and blueberries fresh from my garden and added a bit of vanilla to the batter.  This cobbler is incredibly easy to make and I know I will be using this recipe again and again.

This is very simple & one of the best desserts I have made. I used fresh from the tree peaches that were going to go bad if they weren't used. Added some raspberries too. I have never had that fruit combination before & it is fantastic! Great dessert to make on a busy weeknight too! Thanks!

This is not your typical cobbler. I made this recipe using fresh raspberries. I used 3 cups of berries instead of 2 and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I baked it for 50 minutes and the outside was hard and dark brown and the center was gooey. The taste was O.K. I won't make this again as there are much better cobbler recipes out there.

This was DEEE-licious! It was just my husband and I for dessert tonight, so I cut the receipe in half. The only alterations I made were based on readers and included cooking at 360 for 50 minutes ( in a 4x4 inch pyrex dish for the size) and increasing a fruit by 1/4. Turned out great, not runny, would make again in a heartbeat! Might make a good breakfast dish too....

For a cobbler this was the best I've tried--once with frozen blueberries and once with frozen peaches.  Turned out great.  Very quick and simple.  Thanks for sharing--I'm making copies and passing it around.

Whether or not this recipe meets the true definition of cobbler, it is a very quick, easy and delicious dessert.  I used up some bags of frozen fruit - mostly peaches, then some blueberries and raspberries - it was probably closer to 3 cups of fruit.  I also used soy milk instead of regular milk.  The batter was thin but it turned out very yummy.  The batter seemed sweet but in the end product it balanced nicely with the tartness of the fruit.  I'll definitely make this again with other combinations of fruit and adding some spices.

Thought this was great!  My husband ate two helpings, and only a little is left!  Will definitely make again.  I used frozen mixed berries, so this was the easiest ever!  Will definitely make again!

Very easy, not a fan of the yellow cake mix on top, it's a little too rich for me.  The family liked it a lot.

Good!  I used blueberries and raspberries and I thought it was too much sweet, not enough tart, but that was probably just due to the very sweet fruit I used.  The batter was ok...I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, and I wish I'd added a little more.  Overall, a good recipe and certainly quite easy but I think I'll keep searching for a fruit cobbler recipe.

I used sliced strawberries and blueberries--a little more than the recipe called for.  It was nice and easy to make. I think it tasted better served cold as opposed to warm or room temperature.

great!  I have made this recipe several times and have used different fruits each time and the result is always good.  I get so many comments on how good this cobbler is and it is so easy to make.

This recipe was very easy and tasted great!  My husband loves cobblers so I play around with a few recipes, this one is the best!

I used 12 oz. of frozen raspberries instead of fresh fruit.

Yum!
