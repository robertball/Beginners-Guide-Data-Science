This was the best pesto recipe I've seen so far. I went to my local farmer's market to buy the freshest organic ingredients, and followed the recipe precisely. My family loved it. I will most definitely make this again. I think the ricotta added a nice texture and flavor. Next time I may refrigerate the blend overnite to enhance the flavor for the following day. Excellent!!

This was good, quite similar to regular pesto. I left the chopped tomatoes out of the food processor and just stirred them into the pesto before serving. I would make this again.

Really tasty, esp. after we heated it up again and added (plain) chicken breast chunks. I didn't seed the tomatoes, all I could find was dry mint leaves and I also added more ricotta and a lot more parmesan.

I would recommend making this only with homegrown tomatoes, as it needs the extra flavour.  Like another reviewer, I also didn't add the chopped tomatoes to the pesto in the food processor and instead just spooned them on top of the pasta mixed with the pesto.  Other recommendations- add fresh or dried oregano for extra flavour, use rigatoni instead of linguini, as it's easier to stir and eat, and add a little extra water to make the pesto mixture more saucy.

I like that it was creamy, however I didn't have any ricotta so I just used cream cheese. I think adding some fresh salmon and peas would be good. I will try this next time.

I followed this recipe exactly but added pork chops and served with garlic bread. I made the sauce a few hours before hand to let the flavours blend, annd I put the sauce over the linguinie in a wok and mixed it up to let the sauce heat up again. I served it to my hubby and a girlfriend who was visiting from out of town and we all agreed that it was lacking some major flavour! I definately reccomend adding much more garlic, basil, mint, salt, and pepper as this was quite bland as is! I fully expected "knock your socks off flavour" and it was far from that!

This was really good! It didn't note the size of tomatoes though. I only needed 3 large tomatoes.

My first time making fresh pesto- loved using fresh herbs. Also used homegrown tomatoes. I liked it the most, probably because I got to enjoy the scents as I made it. My husband said it was just okay, that it needed more olive oil for flavor (I thought it could use more garlic). BUT the kids wouldn't touch it. I guess is will take them some time to get used to fresh herbs rather than sauce out of a jar.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  A lively & light summer pasta.  I used a lighter Bowtie pasta cooked in chicken broth.  I was so excited to make it that I used cream cheese rather than going to store for ricotta.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks MASTER815K.

Great basic recipe.  You can play with the amounts of basil, mint, tomatoes to suit your own taste! Can't use nut...so I just omitted...would love to know a good pine nut sub...that's not another nut.  Tried sesame seeds...not a good flavor for this or other pesto recipes.

Rather than using all six tomatoes, I added some sun dried tomatoes in oil just to give a different spin on this recipe.  I also added an extra clove of garlic as we are Italian and love the stuff!

Do not know what happened but this recipe was not as flavorful as I thought it would be. Maybe less tomoatoes and more basil and mint to create more flavor.

I left out the tomatoes, and instead mixed in sun-dried tomatoes with the sauce/pasta. Leaving out the tomatoes was a mistake because it was virtually flavorless once I added the pasta. Also, try adding a lot more water as the sauce is extremely thick.

This recipe made me think outside the box for pesto and I'll be creating my own creations with what's on hand from now on.  Only problem is it looks like catfood but mixed in with the pasta and garnished with some fresh spinach or herbs or tomatos it's fine.  I more or less used the same ingredients except I only had dried basil (looking forward to using fresh) and I tried the cream cheese suggestion.  I didn't exactly follow proportions though - I just kept adding stuff until it tasted good so I probably added more garlic and it needed a lot of salt and pepper.  It has to have a strong flavor so it goes far on the pasta.  I think too much tomato might result in a bland flavor.  Next time I'd add more mint.  This would be good on brushetta, perhaps under a tomato slice to cover up the cat food like appearance.

Only change I made was using 2 large beefsteak tomatoes instead of the 6 in the recipe (because that's all I had). That said, on behalf of all of us who are really not good cooks, I thank you! This was delicious. Will definitely cook it again.

Excellent! Been looking for something to use all my fresh mint in this summer and my Daughter and I loved this! I used sun flower seeds instead of Pine Nuts because that's what I had still excellent taste, it was pretty thick, I might add a little more water next time. Thanks for the recipe

I didn't get it right.  The color was unappealing, so I added tomato paste.  The flavor was bland as people suggested so I just added stuff around the pantry with some success.  What worked best was reserving a few tablespoons and adding red wine vinegar to make a nice low calorie salad dressing.

This was really good and easy. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, so I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, rinsed and drained. I also used whole wheat linquini, this recipe worked well with it.

This was very flavorful, I made home-made fettucine to make it even more special.  I used campari tomatoes (purchased on the vine) and they were so sweet which added to the flavor.  The consistency of the sauce was thick and coated the pasta nicely.
