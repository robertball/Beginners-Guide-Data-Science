After reading reviews that said this cake had a bread like texture I decided to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder to the recipe. The result was fabulous!  Still a dense cake that you would expect to get by adding fruit or veggies (apple, carrot, etc) but definitely a cake like texture.  I used an angel food cake pan and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  Nice rounded top and the cake would have been delicious without the frosting.  I used 1/2 of a cream cheese frosting recipe and added 1/2 of a banana. The result was a runny frosting (although it tasted good) even with adding more powdered sugar.  Next time I'll use banana flavoring in the frosting instead of the banana, although the cake would have been wonderful without any icing.

This is very good. I was looking for a quick recipe to use up bananas and this was perfect. I baked it in a bundt pan for 40 mins and I left out the nuts. It did Not have the dense quality of banana bread like some reviewers said. It was light and moist. I think the secret is to  cream the sugar and margarine (or butter)really well and then add the eggs and mix those in  before adding the rest of the ingredients. I was going to make a glaze for it but the family started eating it as soon as I turned it out of the pan. I will definately make this again!

This is a really tasty recipe.  That said, I had to post a review because I think people ought to be aware that this is not really a cake in the traditional sense.  I made it for Mother's Day, frosted it with vanilla cream cheese frosting and was envisioning a fluffy, moist cake. Unfortunately, it's like banana bread with frosting - really dense, with a slight chew.  Although it was quite delicious,  we just couldn't get past the texture.  I think if you go into it with the understanding that it's more like a bread (and maybe skip the frosting?) you'll be more satisfied with the results.  I think we figured out the SURPRISE! part of the title....

Oh my goodness, this was excellent!  It's the best banana cake I have ever made. Light, fluffy and full flavoured. I did change the recipe slightly. Only used 2 banana's as thats all I had, beat the eggs one at a time into the creamed butter/sugar before adding the flour & added about 1/4 cup of milk as the batter was a little dry. Also it took about 45mins to bake (but I have a slow oven). Will be using this recipe with the changes from now on!

Awesome! Possibly b/c I used cake flour instead of regular flour, which I always do for cakes. 

My 4 bananas were very large. I omitted walnuts, as we don't like them in cakes. Quick breads, sure, but not cake.

Lacking a 9 x 13 pan, I used a silicone 9" square, and it produced a 2" high, fluffy (the cake flour!) cake. 

I'll make this often, with my changes. 

Oh, and did I mention? I highly recommend using cake flour!

This is my first time baking so I chose this simple recipe.  I added 6 bananas and 1 tbsp of vanilla extract to give the strong taste.  Instead of using unsalted butter and add salt later, I used margerin instead and no salt added.  Because I'm not that excited about nuts so I eliminated that altogether.  The result came out perfect moist and fluffy.  A perfect recipe for beginners.  Thanks!!

I had overripe bananas I needed to use, and thought this cake might be a great way to. I frosted it with the brown sugar cream cheese frosting on this site (see my review), and it was very fine. This cake is very, very moist, just the way I like cakes. I will bake it on a regular basis.

Instead of making a cake, I made this recipe into cupcakes.  It made 18 cupcakes & I only baked for 20 min. instead of the suggested 30 min.  I frosted them w/ chocolate frosting; they turned out great!  Will definatly make again.

Like banana bread, but not in a loaf!  Very flavorful and moist. Did not need frosting. Used 5 bananas and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil for a healthy version.

Oh, my.  This isn't a tall cake, but it sure is a good one.  I wanted to lighten it up a little so I added 1/2 c. of buttermilk, alternating it with the dry ingredients. It obviously worked, because this was a moist, banana cake party in your mouth!  "Fudge Frosting," also from this site,  made this so extraordinary I had to discipline myself so that I didn't end up with eater's remorse.  This is awesome good - even without the walnuts. (Note: I baked this at the standard 350 degrees, not 375)

I did not care for this recipe. It didn't rise at all, it was dense and heavy. It really needs an acid to react with the baking soda in this recipe to help leaven it so it is not a leaden cake! Please listen to this review, because it'll mean a huge difference. Baking soda only reacts with an acid, otherwise it's useless in this cake. Buttermilk would've been a great addition somewhere in this recipe with the right modifications of ratios of course. Perhaps i'll edit it and come out with an improved version to help out all those banana cake lovers out there.

This recipe is great! With the added suggestions that people have left it made a nice dense banana cake....add 1 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp total vanilla extract, beat each egg adding to the creamed butter & sugar, and 1/4 cup milk if it is dry.  I usually put in 4-5 bananas that are just about to be overly ripe.  It makes it have a nice banana flavor!  I didn't like store bought cream cheese frosting on it; the creamed vanilla frosting is very complimenting.  I've made this often and after playing with it found that fewer bananas and more milk makes the recipe very light, more like bread or fluffy cake.  The only reason I put 4 stars is that it was a good recipe, but better with the added suggestions.

This is a great recipe - I did add the additional tsp of baking powder as suggested by another reviewer - just to lighten it up. Came out very flavorful, moist and light. I also threw in a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips because we can't resist the banana/chocolate flavor combination in my household.

This cake was really good!  I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts and frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  It was not a light and fluffy cake but it was also not as dense as banana bread, kind of right in between.  I also added 1 tsp of baking powder as suggested by others.  Thanks it was great!

My friend Sabrina who is a awesome baker liked this one and she doesn't like anything. It was a mix between a cake and a abread. It is just good as is doesn't need a glaze. This is definately a keeper. I suggest creaming the sugar and butter for about 2 minutes then adding the eggs and letting that co mingle with the creamed butter mixture. I smashed up the bananas and added that too. Then I sifted the dry ingredients together and added them slowly. Don't overmix this and you'll have a moist, tender product that will be awesome with coffee or a nice tall glass of milk. Oh so good!

I was looking for a new recipe to use up some over ripe bananas I had and  I am glad I found this recipe. I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose  Flour (this I always do because it’s so much better for you) but didn’t change anything else.  I made sure to cream the sugar and flour very well together before adding all the other ingredients. I used a Bundt pan, and because it was dark, the temperature was cut down to 350 degrees so it would not darken too much before it was done. I left it in the oven for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. I let it cool for about 15 minutes and then added a light glaze over it. (Check my photo that I submitted) My husband just raved about it and wanted me to make another one so he could take to work and share with his employees. Thank you tomg for posting this fantastic recipe!

Surprisingly good. I wizzed up 6 overripe ladyfinger bananas in my food processor until mashed well and I beat the butter until pale. Although, this cake took 1 hour to cook, not 30 minutes it tasted fine.

I also added a teaspoon of baking powder based on others' recommendations.  The cake was still somewhat dense, but no problem.  It was moist and didn't even need frosting.

I try not to alter recipes so I can see how they turn out..but I did this time to try and get a "true" cake texture.  It turned out perfect and true. I made a simple icing sugar frost. Measurements are the same unless indicated.  Use electric mixer to beat margarine and sugar then add eggs.  Add flour and some milk (about 1/4 cup) to make a more loose batter. Beat some more. Add vanilla, soda, salt and 1 tsp baking powder. Beat some more.  Mash 2 bananas into mixture.  Baked in round pan at 350 until done about 50 minutes.

I used this recipe to make banana cupcakes for Easter.  Turned out great! I revised this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp of baking powder, 1/4 cup of milk and 2 Tbsp total of vanilla. The result was a very moist and cake like cupcake!!!  I frosted the cupcakes with Pastry Pride whipped topping and topped with pastel polka dot sprinkles.

This is a great recipe.  I used one of the suggestions and used 1 t. of baking powder and the cake flour which made this definately a cake consistency rather than a bready one.  I mashed each banana and added it one at a time to the sugar and butter mixture to ensure that I was getting the right amount.  My bananas were over ripe and I only needed three medium sized ones.  I also substituted half of the granulated sugar with brown sugar simply because I love the flavor of brown sugar.  I added a teaspoon of rum extract as I do with just about any banana bread recipe.  I omitted the nuts.  I made a caramel frosting and poured it on top of the cake and then sprinkled the top with chopped nuts while the frosting was still warm and soft.  This was awesome!  Just what I was looking for!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written with only one addition, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  I also made it in a 9 inch square pan, as other reviewers recommended.  This cake turned out really nicely!  It's somewhat dense and quite moist, a bit of a cross between banana bread and cake (as others have said).  It's got a very nice banana taste without being mushy.  My husband polished off three pieces at dinner and was nibbling on it again at breakfast, so I think I'll be making this one again.  I topped the cake with sifted confectioner's sugar because frosting seemed like it would make the whole thing too sweet.  Good recipe!

Easy and very tasty.  I substituted applesauce for the butter to cut the fat.

I used 3 bananas instead of 4, and used about 1 and a 3/4 cup flour and also added some chocolate chips. It came out like bread and it tasted perfect!

This was really dense and heavy and turned out more like bars or a flat banana bread than a cake, despite following the recipe. Will not make again.

This cake is very moist and flavorful.
The directions for step #3 should be more detailed as follows:add the wet ingredients (eggs, bananas, and vanilla).  Then sift together and add the dry ingredients (flour, soda, and salt). Finally, stir in the nuts.

This is just a fantastic cake. I frosted it with a cinnamon cream cheese icing, and it is just divine. I'll be adding some chocolate chips and making it as a layer cake for my daughter's birthday.

Delicious!  I had only three bananas but it was still great.  I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, but didn't make any other changes to the ingredients.  Baked it in two round layers and mixed up a maple cream cheese frosting for it (butter, cream cheese, vanilla, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar), then sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Yum!!

i made this in a bundt pan and it took 40 mins. as the reviews suggested i creamed the sugar and butter very well and then added the eggs one at a time. sifted the flour, baking soda and salt together in a separate bowl first and added it to the mixture and mixed well again. i folded the mashed bananas and vanilla in at the end by hand. this resulted in a very fluffy cake- like texture not like banana bread at all. i glazed it with a smooth cinnamon chocolate glaze. i think it would taste great w/ praline ice cream

I took another person's advice and made cake flour, which does give it a nice texture.  Cut flour to 1 3/4 cups, and add 1/4 cup cornstarch.  I added eggs, vanilla and bananas to creamed mixture first.  Mix dry ingredients together then add the dry ingredients a little at a time to the wet ingredients.  I did not use unsalted butter, just salted butter, but the salt level was fine.  I found the 30 minute time to be on the dot.  You can add another banana or a little milk if the batter seems really thick, but I made a double batch using 9 large bananas and they turned out perfect.  I frosted them with Buttercream frosting from this site and took one cake to church tonight and it was a HUGE hit!  We only had about 15 people and I think they would have eaten both of them if I had taken both with me!

This was so good! Everyone knows the key to a moist cake is to really cream that butter well, then add the ingredients one at a time with all the dry ingredients sifted together and added slowly. I added cinnamon, cocoa powder and an extra banana! I love it and will make it again and again

Made almost as is, added powdered sugar glaze on top.  4 stars only because we are milk-free and used a coconut butter spread instead of butter.  And added chocolate chips.  Made in a Bundt pan as others suggested.  Wonderful!  While making it, my teenage daughter said "I am not eating that.  I don't like bananas."  She ate it and decided it will be her birthday cake!!

Great cake/bread.  I mixed the eggs, sugar and butter for 5 minutes to get a fluffy mixture with the end result of a lighter airer Banana Cake.  Frosted with Vanilla Cream Cheese.  Delicious.  I am still on the hunt for a true banana cake like I had as a kid.

While the flavor was good, my cake was heavy!  I creamed the butter and sugar thoroughly as others suggested, adding eggs one at a time, etc.  All I can figure is that maybe it didn't turn out well because I am at a high altitude and didn't adjust for that.  I doubt I'll make this one again.

The flavour of this cake is wonderful.  Made as directed except I used pecans for the walnuts. Next time I will take one reviewers advice and add 1 tsp baking powder just to lighten it up a wee bit.  Thank you for sharing.

Very cakey, different texture than a traditional loaf! Exactly what I was looking for. Could use a bit more zing... not sure, maybe more bananas? More vanilla?

This was INCREDIBLE! I used 5 bananas, becasue that's what I had and I was trying to get rid of them. I also wanted it to be more of a spice cake, so I added a couple tsps Pumpkin Pie Spice. I didn't have walnuts on hand so I used pecans. Topped it with cream cheese frosting. Wow!!! Will for sure be making again and again!

I left out the nuts, used butter with salt in it (and left out the ex. 1/2 tspn salt) and added about 3/4 cup sour cream which I read moistens a cake. PERFECTION!  Sour Cream Frosting, also from this site, topped it off.

I did this recipe as except I used Splenda Blend instead of sugar and excluded the nuts.  I used the Banana Butter Frosting (this site) and it was all perfection!

The Hubbs, my favorite food critic, said that not only must I bake it again, but I could give it out for Christmas gifts and could even sell loaves.  I had about five pounds of bananas I needed to do something with, so this was one of my banana experiments-and a wildly successful one at that!    I added an extra banana (because I certainly had plenty to spare) and 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar.  I used LIGHT Smart Balance and used a bundt pan.  Not only was this extremely easy, but I was very pleased with the results.  Surprisingly I didn't "tweak" the recipe anymore than that!  I'm notorious for following a recipe as a suggestion rather than direction.  I think this should be a recipe every cook should have in her repitoire!  This will definitely be repeated in my kitchen.

Yes, this cake was more like a loaf bread, but it was delicious!  I baked it in a loaf pan and added 15-20 minutes to the baking.  I found that it was a little too buttery so next time I would either cut down on the butter or substitute a canola oil for half the butter called for.

I substituted Smart Balance for the butter and 1/2 cup egg substitute for the two eggs.  As suggested, I added the 1 tsp. baking powder.  Baked it in a silicone bundt pan, first sprayed with cooking spray and then sprinkled with chopped walnuts.  Baked for 48 minutes.  Result is more like Banana Bread than cake, but still good!

I made this for a pool party but used soft margarine instead of butter and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I frosted it with canned cream cheese frosting. Many requests for the recipe! Additional comment -- I've made it again since, and topped it with Chocolate Glaze I -- awesome! It is very quick to throw together, and you don't have to be an expert cake maker. I hate baking, so I was pleased with the easy method.

This turned out fantastic!  I iced it with a frosting made by boiling 1/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup butter, then adding one teaspoon vanilla and 5 cups confectioners sugar and pouring it on while the banana cake and icing were still hot.  It made it very sweet and cake-like.  The consistency of the cake IS bread-like, but I think that it is a selling point of this recipe, not a reason not to do it.  I needed something to do with some bananas and this worked extremely well.  I have to say I think that 9' by 13' is too big.  The batter also scared me.  I don't know if I should have had the butter at room temperature or warmer, but my battery was very thick and doughy.

I agree with other reviewers - it's similar to banana bread; topped with a maple-flavored buttercream frosting, it was more cake-like.  Let the flavors develop overnight and use exceptionally over-ripe fruit, just as you would for banana bread.

I followed this recipe exactly.  Same measurements, same cooking time, and same oven temperature.  Perfect!  It's definitely a banana bread texture except not as dense.  Instead of mixing the nuts in the batter, I just topped the cream cheese layer with nuts--easier for non-nut lovers to scrape off.  I highly recommend a dash of cinnamon which seems to naturally complement bananas.

This cake was very good.  Unfortunately only my husband and I enjoyed it - my kids thought it was just okay.  I followed the advice from one of the other reviewers and added the 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 ts. nutmeg.  The cake smelled heavenly coming from the oven!  I frosted the cake with a very thin layer of cream cheese frosting which added a nice touch to this delicious cake!

This cake was delicious....although I agree with some reviewers comments about it having the texture of banana bread rather then cake. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I made a simple cinnamon buttercream frosting to ice the cake with....That really made it special. My husband and 4 children ate the entire cake within minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this yesterday, turned out delicious, somewhat between a regular, fluffy cake and a traditional banana bread texture.  Very moist, not heavy at all.  Frosted it with a plain vanilla frosting with a touch of cream cheese.  Used 4 medium sized, freckled bananas.  This cake is excellent; I will make it again; it's disappearing fast in my house.

I wish I had followed American Beauty's lead and used a 9"square pan: in a 9x13" pan, this cake didn't get very high (see photo). It was moist, but not heavy or dense like banana bread. Of course, it tasted like banana bread; it had four mashed bananas in it! It was plenty sweet for us. The addition of some cream cheese frosting made it super-sweet. I would make this again, but definitely in a smaller pan.

Turned out really well.  First time making a banana cake so I had nothing to compare to.  I followed the recipe without the nuts and used 1 cup cake flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  Next time I will use all cake flour because it was still a little heavy like a light banana bread. Frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Thanks!

I added one extra banana since mine were pretty small and followed the recipe exactly other than that and it came out delicious!!  It was so moist, light, and fluffy it was perfect.  I am a horrible baker, nothing I bake ever seems to come out correctly but this was so easy and tasted great.  I personally don't like frosting and this cake definitely didn't need any, it was sweet enough for my nieces and nephews (ages 1-10) to gobble it up for dessert and beg for seconds, but not so sweet that it was too much for all the adults.  This literally was gone in under 10 minutes, I can't rave enough about it.  If you have some really ripe bananas this is a great way to use them up!!

Baking this cake for 40 min in a bundt pan seems to suit its cakebread texture. I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter, as well as 1/2 c golden raisins. Nixed the nuts and the frosting. The result? Awesome!

I have to completely disagree with the most critical review of this recipe. It says the baking soda is useless in this recipe because it needs an acid to react with. Well, bananas are acidic! Butter is acidic also. That said I think they were expecting a light cake, and probably thought the cake needed baking powder to help with the rise. This recipe is not a true cake, it is more like a banana bread(most banana breads only use baking soda as a chemical leavener)It is still a delicious cake/loaf, and as long as you don't over mix the batter you should end up with a moist banana-bread-type snacking cake.

Perfect! I used 6 bananas instead of 4 and it turned out very moist. I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, it was not done in the middle so I baked it 10 additional minutes at 350 degrees.

I loved this cake! I added the one teaspoon of baking powder as suggested by one other viewer and it gave it a bit of a lift. I'm not a fan of walnuts, so I added some bitter sweet chocolate chips to it. I made a little icing with chocolate to add to the top as well.

After reading the reviews, I made this with the following changes: I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and added 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream for an acid. The cake turned out incredibly good. It is a dense cake, but as it's a banana cake you expect that. I frosted it with maple cream cheese frosting. This is one cake that doesn't last in the house long!

Did as one other reviewer suggested and added a teaspoon of baking powder. Light and not too sweet, very good. I frosted with brown sugar cream cheese frosting and put the walnuts on top rather than in the cake. Will definitely make again.

I give this cake 4 stars because it really is more like a banana bread than a cake.  I was wondering if you added another egg if it would give it a more cake-like texture (like you can do with brownies).  It is, however, delicious.  I used 5 bananas because I had that many over-ripe bananas. It had a fantastic banana flavor.  I also made it in a bundt pan and baked at 350 degrees for 45 mins.  I frosted it with the Sour Cream Frosting from this site.....it is a fantastic frosting that I highly recommend!

I had made this for my mother's birthday last year as a surprise. This cake was rather dense but good nonetheless. It didn't quite taste enough like bananas though.

Exceptional!  Thanks for a great, easy, tasty version of an old standard.  Came out perfectly - just like the picture shown.  I used very, very, very ripe large bananas.  You don't need to frost, just sprinkle with powdered sugar - that's the "diet" version!  Keep an eye on the cake, mine cooked in just under 30 minutes in the 9x13 inch pan.

I thought this cake was very, very good.  I used vanilla frosting and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. Very good and a great way to use bananas.

Not the light and fluffy cake I was hoping for, but none the less quite good and moist.  If I was to make this recipe again, I would add a cup of chocolate chips and forget the frosting.  Sort of like one of those old time snacking cakes.

I substituted the butter for 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon of applesauce to make it fat free and they were great.  If you decide to do this you should use a little less banana or sugar.

Used many ofthe suggested additions: 1 tbsp vanilla 1 tsp each baking soda/powder Subbed mini chocolate chips instead of nuts (as I had none) Filled cupcake liners very full and baked at 375 for almost 30 minutes (I have a slow oven)  All in all an awesome wAy to use use lots of old bananas at once (which I had many many of).  Since I throw my bananas in the freezer they seem to be very juicy when I thaw them out so I make a habit of draining them well and pat them dry.  Didn't frost them either, they didn't need it!  Aldo added about 1/4c of half and half and cut the sugar to 2/3c

This was a really easy way to use up squishy bananas. I made them with butter and eggs at room temperature. I made 12 biggish muffins instead of a cake and didn't top with frosting. I added some pecan to the nut mix with the walnuts and placed a half pecan on the top of each muffin for decoration. I also added some cinnamon and ginger to the mix. They were eaten during a family birthday celebration as a supplementary sweet to the cake and enjoyed by all. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe. I changed it a little.  I added a tablespoon of vanilla instead and a 1/4 cup of milk.  I used 5 bananas, two of which came out of the freezer.  I tend to freeze over riped bananas.  I also added chocolate chips.  About 1/2 cup.  Yummy.

I only had 3 bananas and baked the cake in a Bundt pan (maybe that's why I had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes).  However the cake was really good, not heavy like banana bread) and delicious uniced and served with chocolate peanut butter ice cream.

I was trying to find a banana cake or bread recipe that used as many overripe bananas as possible because I had a basket full of them! This one was great, although I did modify: I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar; I added 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips in order to skip making the frosting; and I added a generous dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to kick up the hearty spice. I also nixed the salt simply because I forgot about it. Hubby loved it and he's usually very picky about banana bread/cake recipes. Thank you... still trying to figure out what the surprise part of the cake is. :-)

This was very tasty but it really didn't have a cake-like texture.  It was more like banana bread texture, although absolutely no one complained!  I cannot give 5 full starts because it's truly not "cake."

I thought this cake was good. Great for an everyday type cake and great for using up those overripe bananas! I wouldn't necessarily call this company worthy, but still good. I substituted 1/3 cup egg beaters egg whites instead of the 2 eggs. Topped with a cream cheese icing.

This is a wonderful recipe, and the first one I have had that doesn't have the taste or texture of a banana bread. I did make some minor changes, omitted the nuts as I don't care for them. And added 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I frosted with a cinnamon flavored cream cheese icing. I will make this recipe often.

I could not believe the ease in baking this cake! I took out a stick of butter, threw it in the microwave for 20 seconds, then threw all the ingredients in the mixer ( along with a suggested 1/2 tsp baking powder). Within 3 minutes my batter was ready. I spooned it into the prepared pan and sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips over the top of the cake. 30 minutes later it was done, and then 30 more minutes and my family had gobbled down the whole thing! DELICIOUS!!

This was wonderful... I did as ROBINBRADY did, halving the whole recipe, using 1/2 tsp of baking powder and cooking for 25 minutes in an 8 X 8 pan.  I omitted the nuts but sprinkled the top of the batter with 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.  We had it warm for dessert and it was chocolately banana goodness!!  The whole family loved it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did follow the recommendation to add 1 tsp baking powder, and I did.  It was cake, not bread.  Fabulous!  Eaten without the frosting and was tasty, will definately make again!

My best banana cake thus far. I added the 1 tsp of baking powder as suggested by a reviewer and the cake was fluffy and delicious. Loved it, thank you for sharing the recipe.

We thought this cake turned out a little heavy, so will be looking for another banana cake recipe. Also, watch the baking time--the stated time was a little too long for my oven.

I had two ripe bananas so I cut the recipe in half, put in an 8x8 pan. Instead of incorporating the nuts into the batter, I sprinked half of the surface with pecans (my husband's preference) and half with chocolate chips for my daughter. Baked in 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. Perfect. Oh, I did add the baking powder suggested by others.

Great cake and super easy. Regular all purpose flour worked fine. I made this today exactly as written except that in addition to the 1 tsp baking soda, I added 1 tsp baking powder. I'm out of vanilla extract so I used a splash of Torani vanilla syrup. To save a bit of calories, I used 2/3 c. regular sugar and 1/3 c. Splenda. I cooked it at 350F, not 375F, and it was done in around 25 mins. If I had put it in at 375F for 30 mins per the instructions, I suspect the cake would be overcooked.

Nice and easy. I added a tsp. of baking powder and did half vanilla extract and half maple extract, just for a change. This batter filled four mini bundt pans and one mini loaf pans. Smells divine, too.

This was a snap to make and VERY FLAVORFUL!  Not dry at ALL! I changed very little about this! YUM-O!!  I did use 4 - VERY LARGE bananas. I never use anything but Mexican vanilla, and I tossed in about 3/4 cu. semisweet chocolate chips.  That was it!  I don't really care for banana bread, but my sweetie does.  This cake was great!  I served it warm with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream on it, and it was a hit(have to confess that even I liked it..lol)

Super good~~~super easy!

This didn't live up to my expectations. Was pretty dry.  I made alot of the modifications suggested by others.  Used half white and half brown sugar.  Added extra tsp of baking soda.  Used cake flour.  Added 1 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg. Baked at 350 in a 9" pan for 35 mins.  Sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  Good flavor, but not moist.  Would rather have had regular banana bread . . . regular banana cake.  Anything that last 3 1/2 days in my house isn't worthy of being a keeper.

This was really good!  Easy to do and quick to make.  I didn't have any walnuts on hand so I used chocolate chips instead.  Next time I will put it in muffin papers.

This was absolutely wonderful!!! The texture was in between a cake and banana bread and I loved it. I left out the nuts and added 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also topped it with the banana butter icing recipe on this site. Came out fantastic!!!

This is more like a banana bread but I still found it quite good and not too sweet with good banana flavor. I didn't put a frosting on it and it was quite good on its own but I do think it would taste great with a buttercream or cream cheese frosting.

Fantastic.
I had run out of vanilla essence and it still tasted great. Also I used walnut pieces instead of chopped - i like to taste the nut! Sprinkled with icing sugar. Delicious and moist.

i was looking for an easy banan cake that i could make with ingredients i already had in the house.  this one seemed the best option.  i only had three bananas but they were large.  i didnt add walnuts, instead i added chopped chocolate and dried cranberries.  i used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  the result was good.  very moist and flavorful.  you could definitely taste the bananas.

Loved this recipe!  I would say it was a mix between a cake like texture and a bread.  Very mosit and tasty!  I added an extra banana(mine was small to medium size) and also 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of nuts.  I also baked for 45 mins in an angel food pan.  Turned out fantastic - my Mom & fiance both loved it!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  It is moist and has good taste.  I made it in a pampered chef bar pan and cut it into small squares with no frosting. It is a great snack for the children.

The batter was too much like banana bread so i added an additional 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup oil.

I lost an old recipe that was amazing and chose this one to try. I added 1 tsp baking powder (as one review suggested) and cinnammon ( about 1/2 tsp) in the mixture. Then i used the walnuts suggested in the recipe for a topping instead (with brown sugar, cinnamon and cut up butter) for the crumby look on the top. Very happy with the results

I made this as directed and it came out great, but then I got to thinking..add something else? So I decided to add strawberries. I pureed them and added it to the batter and a bit on top.. Again came out great.  I made a double batch( for a thicker cake) if doing this ADD another 10 minutes or so to baking.

I made this lovely cake for company and everyone loved it. My bananas weren't as ripe as I'd hoped for so I spent a few extra minutes mashing them up with a fork. The only thing I changed was baking it at 385* for high altitude (my elevation is 7000'), removing 2 Tbsp sugar, and adding a Tbsp of water. I baked it in a bundt pan and it took 40 minutes. Texture was between cake and bread, so very nice for a fall evening.

I have made this cake today for my niece. It seems like the texture is more like a bread which is kind of what I was hoping for. I did add a cup of buttermilk to it as I think that will make it more moist. It seemed to ave given a decent but not too high rise to the cake. I will frost it with a prepared vanilla frosting or dust it lightly with powdered sugar. I will rate it again after she tries it.

I added the same amount of both baking soda and baking powder. I wanted the cake to be a little sweeter, so added a half cup more sugar. The cake was phenomenal!!! No need for any frosting.

So I made this today but I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers. I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 cup of milk. And I always add a bit more vanilla.  Also I used a glass pan so baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Was still a tad dense but very moist and it did rise nicely. I used a store bought vanilla icing which I thought made up for the cake being slightly dense.

I added a dash of lemon juice to the wet ingredients to provide the acid to react with the backing soda, and the result was a delicious, light and moist cake that was flavourful and easy to make! definitely one to keep!

Deliciously moist and satisfying.  I used whole wheat pastry flour for a lighter texture.  Subbed 1/2 the butter with unsweetened apple sauce (so 1/4 cup butter = 1/2 stick = 4 tablespoons, and 1/4 cup applesauce).  Added 1 teaspoon baking powder.  Prefer less sweetness so cut sugar to 3/4 cup, but my bananas were VERY ripe so that made up for slightly less sugar. 

Creamed butter and sugar together, then added beaten eggs, then added to the mashed bananas/apple sauce/vanilla/walnuts, and finally mixed in dry ingredients. 

Enjoyed it immensely and will make again and again.

While the flavor was fine the texture was a bit odd. I'm not sure what I did wrong because I followed the recipe exactly but it didn't have the texture of cake or bread. 3 stars for taste.

Excellent!  I did what some of the others have done. Added 1 tsp of baking powder and baked in a round cylinder pan. It was light, not real heavy like a banana bread. We frosted it with a cream cheese/butter frosting ??

Added both baking soda and baking powder to offset the heavy fruit, cake was soft and fluffy not dense at all. Omitted nuts (by accident) it was wonderful!! 
Baked in a bundt pan for 40 minutes. 
Cooled for 20 minutes before adding thin powdered sugar icing.

Definitely a keeper. I’ve tried so many variations. I ran out of vanilla and nuts so these were omitted. The banana cake still turned out fantastic! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made it with 5 bananas instead of 4 and it turned out fine. I iced it with store bought cream cheese icing. It was also good a couple days later after being refrigerated.

Nice cake! I halved the recipe and put in a 8 x 8 pan. The walnuts were great. Making it one day earlier really makes the flavor come alive. I added another banana to make it moister. Yum,yum!

Very good! I did add 1/2 tsp of baking powder to help create a more cake-like texture. Otherwise, the only additions were 1/4 cup of coconut and a small amount of dried pineapple I decided to use up. Frosted with. cream cheese frosting and topped with coconut.  Would make again; love the walnuts.

I decided to make this cake on a whim! Knowingly, my mom does not bake, therefore, there is really not much baking supplies at her home other than the ones I've left behind. With that said, there was no vanilla extract and no measuring spoons/cups (SMH) !! SO with that said, i used - French Vanilla Creamer and eyeballed almost every ingredient- well to my surprise, it worked out just great. I think this has made the recipe less dense as other reviewers have said. It was deliciously moist and just the right amount of sweetness. I did however reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup. Trying it out again but using vanilla extract and adding a wet ingredient - buttermilk!

I made this cake as directed.  It was great.  It was light and fluffy and not too sweet.  It was very easy  with simple ingredients that you usually have on hand especially when you dont want to throw away banana's that are too ripe.  I will definitely make this cake again...

I used a bundt pan and baked for 30 minutes. I also added some lemon juice to the bananas ( about a teaspoon). It smells wonderful and looks like it will be very moist. Too hot to try dang it ??

I made this recipe into cupcakes . I creamed the butter and sugar really well, blended in the eggs one at a time blending well, then the banana before adding in the flour last (I used self rising flour so I omitted the baking powder and salt) also didn't add walnuts as my girls are not nut fans. My cupcakes came out with a moist texture. They  enjoyed them a lot as you can see from my photo of the cupcakes on the glass plate. I didn't have the issue others had of hard or dense texture, maybe it was the self rising flour or the fact that I added all moist ingredients well one at a time before the flour. But they were amazing. My girls suggested next time that we make them adding chocolate chips. Definitely will try that for them.

I included the baking powder as suggested by one other reviewer and I also used one cup cake flour and one cup all purpose flour and this seemed to work for me. It wasn't dense as some reviewers had stated.  I reduced the sugar as well as I am trying to decrease my sugar intake and it was sweet enough as the bananas also sweetened it. I used 3/4 cup sugar and it was still sweet enough. Loved this recipe. was quick and easy. would definitely try again.

I  tasted the batter and it seemed like it was missing something so I added some cinnamon and nutmeg. It turned out really good but next time I will be adding a box of banana cream pudding for a boost to the flavor.

It didn't rise at all, I don't mind the texture but next time I will add baking powder to have an actual cake not this sort of thick pancake I got here lol, wish I had read the reviews first...

Also to lower the fat content per serving, I used half the amount of butter and replaced the other half with unsweetened applesauce.

This cake was amazing! I made a few small changes. I added 1.5 tsp of baking powder as other reviewers suggested. I also used non-dairy Earth Balance soy-free spread in place of the dairy butter. The resulting cake rose beautifully and was perfectly moist. I will definitely be making it again!

A pretty good cake.  I suspect some people use sodium bicarbonate (bicarbonate of soda)  instead of baking powder (baking soda)  so the cake does not rise.  Baking powder is a mix of bicarb and an acid (like citric or malic acid) so always rises. 
Use baking powder people!

LOVE this recipe. This is the only banana bread/cake recipe I follow ever since I first tried it last Christmas. It's not too sweet which is probably why everyone likes it. I use whole wheat flour for the recipe. I don't usually include nuts because they're not normally in the house but if I'm feeling for it, I do substitute with chocolate chips. The texture is more of a bread than that of a cake but it is still the type of outcome I was expecting. Just delicious.

Very easy to make and delicious. I've made it twice now, once with organic sprouted wheat flour and the second time with combination of brown rice flour and buckwheat flour for gluten free version. I used organic sugar and both times reduced the amount to 1/2 cup sugar, which was perfect for us. Seems to me the key to a nice moist cake with this recipe is super over ripe bananas -- so soft that it falls out of the peel and practically loses shape as it goes into the bowl. I only had 3 medium sized bananas the second time I made it, but turned out just fine, moist.  I didn't have nuts, so added in chocolate chips.

I halved the sugar and used half WW flour and used a simple vanilla buttercream frosting. I still found it too sweet but it could be due to the bananas I used being really sweet too. Overall, not a bad cake. Easy to whip up and a different way to use up overripe bananas other than banana bread.

I made this , creamed the butter well with my trustee Kitchen Aid mixer, adding the eggs one by one as suggested and put a teaspoon of baking powder.  It still came out more like a bread than a cake. Flavor was good though, I renamed it Banana cake bread so my guests wouldn't get the wrong idea. Frosting helped.

Like others I tweaked it. I added 1.5 tsp of baking powder and 5 medium bananas.  I baked it In a bundt and baked for 40 minutes
It's light and airy  and delicious with no icing.

I added one tablespoon of self rising flour.  And used 4 and half bananas. The cake was very good.  But it gets fully baked within 12 mins in my oven so.. be careful.  Also for my topping I used butter, milk, lemon juice and confection sugar.

Added the tsp of baking powder as suggested.  Used unlined, greased cupcake pans.  Dusted with powdered sugar.  Oh, and reduced sugar by about 1/4 cup.  MARVELOUS!  Fluffy and delicious!

I made this  over the weekend. I made it almost exactly as written. The only thing I did different or by mistake I add cinnamon and nutmeg.  Most banana recipes call  for them and I just add them before reading the recipe one last time. It still turned out yummy.

I wanted to make muffins for my kids, but desired a more cake-like texture, so I used the basic recipe, but totally made it my own. Wanting to add berries, I placed some frozen blueberries and cranberries in a bowl and allowed them to mingle with a sprinkle of sugar and some lemon juice while I made the batter. After creaming the butter and sugar, I omitted adding the dry ingredients to blend the wet ingredients first. I then sifted the dry ingredients, with the addition of 1 tsp of baking powder as recommended by poster MYSTE, and instead of nuts, I added 2 tsp flax seed meal (attempt to get the kids to get some omegas). After incorporating the dry ingredients, I strained the berries (tried to avoid additional moisture, which might make texture rubbery) and folded them into the batter. Placed in coconut oil greased muffin pan, and baked for ~20 min. Picky eater approved!

Awesome! I wanted to use up my overripe bananas but I didn't want heavy bread!  This is right on the money!  I allowed the butter and sugar to cream together on low speed for several minutes.  I then added the eggs &  vanilla which I whisked together, then the bananas and finally the dry ingredients and returned the mixer to low until incorporated. I switched the mixer to medium and blended the batter thouroughly.  I omitted the nuts.  I divided the batter into two prepared glass 8 x 8 inch baking dishes and baked in 375° F oven  for 35 minutes and cooled completely on racks before turning them onto plates.  I am going to keep one and give one away!  I will definitely make this one again!  Love it! I would give it Ten Stars if I could!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I have made this twice already: once in a regular pan, and today I made cupcakes. I wish I had walmuts to stay true to it, but used pecans the first time, and today, I used almonds. The other incidental change was because I didn't have baking soda. So I used 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and it was absolutely perfect. The first time, since it was a little thin (it was half the recipe- only 2 bananas), I cut it in 2 loafs, placed one, topped with frosting, placed other half on top and frosted again.  I used the cream cheese frosting II on this site. Delicioso! Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

I really liked this recipe. It was dense and rich. I added 6 ripe small bananas. I frosted it with a light and fluffy vanilla frosting; just a thin layer. My husband and I loved it and I don't understand the negative reviews.

This was very easy. It's hot here so the butter softened quickly - this is the part I hate most about baking is softening butter and creaming it with sugar. But it was easy. Now I did use bananas, but only 2 (they were really black). And I used all purpose wheat flour for both cups of flour. It was dense and light at the same time. I've been learning not to over mix - so I got a good rise from this dough. And my surprise was coffee. I thought they came out okay other than a bit too dense. Oh yeah I made them muffins and not a cake.

This is really good, especially with the banana nut frosting recipe from this site.  I added another tsp. of baking soda, as another person suggested, but I haven't had it otherwise so it might be just as good without.

This is more like a bread than a cake, but tastes delicious.  I make it per the recipe, though I leave out the salt.  When I have a lot of bananas sometimes I use 5 instead of 4.  Also, sometimes I add peanut butter chips.

Great recipe. Mine finished 5 minutes earlier than stated time. Very nice, and I topped mine with duncan hines' cream cheese frosting. Not phenomenal as in trying to impress someone. I did add some diverse autumnal spices (cinnamon and nutmeg to be precise) however it would be fine without them too. Mine cooked really dark on the top shelf in the oven.

The cake tastes good, the only problem I had was the thickness of it, it looks like an oversized pancake, it should have been made in a 9 inch square pan, not a 9 x 13 pan.. it is not high like a cake but flat. it is tasty, and I made a cream cheese frosting, by whipping 1 8oz cream cheese with 3 tbls of Agave Syrup.. and it is good. but the next time I will use a different pan.

Did a few tweaks to this recipe.Used homemade cake flour,Splenda sugar blend,5 bananas,1TBS vanilla,1tsp lemon extract & baked at 365 degrees in a 10" cast iron skillet. The cake came out light & fluffy.Frosted with cream cheese frosting while still slightly warm. Will be making this again real soon.

Following some advice in the reviews, I added a tsp of baking powder, and I also beat the eggs well into the creamed butter mixture before adding the dry ingredients. I also omitted the walnuts. The cake turned out nice and light (although not very high), and it tastes good. I would make this again.

This cake tasted so good and was really easy to make!  I made it in a dark bundt pan and it took about 45-50 minutes to bake.  Great recipe and I'll definitely make it again!

Delicious!  Very banana tasting cake!  I changed one small thing--I only used 1/4 cup butter and substituted the other 1/4 cup with applesauce.  In fact, I made a second batch using pureed pineapple isntead of applesauce and it was still delicious!    Made muffins with the second batch.  20 minutes in the oven did the trick!  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  Thanks Tomg!

Excellent Recipe!!  I thought the consistency was perfect!!  I made it into cupcakes and didn't even bother to put frosting or any topping on as it was delicious without!  Will definitely make this again!

Great cake...  slightly dense but delicious! I actually added 1 tsp of baking powder per another reviewer's comments, worked well. Instead of frosting I added about a cup of chocolate chips sprinkled on top before I put it in to bake. The chocolate really worked well with the banana. Yummy!!

I thought I'd try this since some reviewers said they got a light texture, but I should have listened to my gut.  Sure enough, mine turned out like banana bread.  Not a delicate cake like I was looking for.  As a banana bread ricipe, I might have given this 4 stars.  But as a cake, I gave it 3.

This is heavenly, light in cake texture and nice banana flavor! Very easy, quick prep time too. After reading the other reviews I added 1/4 c banana and a slight drbble of vanilla. I also ran short of flour so added 1/4 c. of old fachioned oatmeal. I mixed the ingredients as directed in the original recipe making sure I mixed thoroughly so the cake would have a nice fluffy cakelike texture. I will definitely make this again. YUM-YUM-YUMMY!!!

I really liked this recipe!  I used to always freeze overripe bananas to use in smoothies but I also love to bake, so I'm glad to have found a good baking recipe for overripe bananas.    I was tempted to use some imitation banana extract because I wasn't sure how much banana flavor would be present from just using the nanners, but I'm glad I resisted--4 bananas and it's such a tasty cake!    Although I can see what people say about the consistency being very bread-like.  I even sifted my flour and it came out kind of like banana bread but I don't care~I love banana bread!  :)

If you are looking for a cake recipe, this is not for you.  It has a bread-like texture.  Not very moist.  The recipe itself is tasty.  I used 3 bananas and tasted the flavor.  I used the batter in muffin tins and baked for 20 minutes at 350 F. Portions: 12 large muffins.

I give this cake 4 stars as a bread, not as a cake. It is very dense, especially with the nuts and etc. I added brown sugar which may have added more thickness, so that may have been a fault. I would recommend as a bread or as a loaf-cake with icing that was drizzled over it. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great! I added 1/2 cup of golden raisins and topped it with an orange-flavored frosting made with butter, orange juice, powdered sugar and vanilla.  This cake isn't too sweet, which is nice! Great banana flavor and the cake is a cross between bread and cake. Would definitely make it again!

Very good! I added a little bit of extra banana for extra flavour.  The bars turned out very dense, and I wasn't sure how people would like it... But I made it for the first time for my great aunt's 75th birthday party, and people raved about these Banana Bars!  The only thing about these bars is I found the icing to be a little too sweet. Maybe I put in too much icing sugar? I am going to try a glaze next time.

Great!   Take others suggestions, I added an additional tsp of baking soda, used cake flour, and beat everything to death before adding dry ingredients.  This definitely was a cake, and not a bread - yureka!  I frosted with cream cheese frosting but probably will use a different frosting next time.  My tastebuds are trained to expect carrot cake when tasting cc frosting!   Loved the CAKE - thanks so much!

It has a very good banana flavor(4 stars), just not digging the texture(2 stars),...its kind of dry and crumbly.  So the average is three stars.  I will keep looking for another banana cake recipe.

It really is more of a bread than cake. Mine didn't rise very high despite adding a teaspoon of baking powder, like someone suggested. It does have a very good flavor and my toddler can't seem to get enough.  :)  Thank you for recipe!

The batter smelled absolutely delicious while baking, and the cake is nice and moist.  I tweaked it by adding 1 1/2 cups of oats for a nice "oatmeal cookie" type texture, it tastes phenomenal.  Enjoy!!

As written our cake was completely raw in the middle. It took an extra 20 minutes to bake. I might try again or this might just not be the recipe for us.

It was quite a good recipe but I changed it abit. I put 1/2 teaspoon more salt and 1/2 more banana. To make the cake nice and light, first gradually put eggs,and then when the mixture is smooth, add the banana, then the flour, soda, and salt. Other than those variations, it was a light, moist cake.

First Time Making Banana Anything. I loved the taste of this. I Forgot to add the vanilla in the bowl. I had to almost brush it on the mixture once it was in the pan. but It came out good. The only thing I changed from the recipe was to add more nuts. This Recipes was super easy and everyone in my family LOVED IT!

It was an amazing recipe. The cake comes out very moist. The best thing was that when it was already baked, i left it in the oven further away from the fire and the top of cake turned out crispy and crunchy while the rest of the cake was soft and moist. It was a perfect balance! Also, we added some granola and chocolat/vanilla sandwich cookies (crushed obviously) to add some chocolate to the recipe. chocolate and bananas (mmmm...) i will probably put in some walnuts (because i didnt have any) and chocolate chips next time.

This is a good basic (and easy!) recipe. I started making it and realized I only had Baking Powder, not Baking Soda, so after a quick search on the internet I substituted 2 tsp. baking powder and reduced the salt by half. Still turned out great. It was a little more dense in texture, more like a banana muffin, but still good. My 8 year old loved it!

Overall good.  One more banana probably would have brought out the flavor more.  I added chocolate chips and cream cheese icing and had a very satisfying dessert!

Easy and quick recipe and the result was fabulous. 5 stars plus two thumbs up from me! After I gave the recipe to my French friend, she came up with her own version, which was banana chocolate chip cake. It was very delicious!

This is one of the easiest banana cake recipes I've ever found.  I have of this in my pantry/frig at all times.  I also like to use the Chocolate Frosting I recipe for the topper.  It's fudgy, yet not too thick.  It really sets off this fabulous cake nicely.  Great combination.  I also used the extra teaspoon of baking powder.  Came out perfectly!

I made only 12 servings and I baked them in two 6 inch pans.  I used salted butter, and did not use nuts.  It turned out great!  Very moist and soft.  It was perfect.  By far one of my favorite cake recipes ever.

I made this recipe only to use up some ripe bananas I had, and I'm glad I did! Very moist and very similar to banana bread. I did however leave off the frosting. I will DEFINATELY make this recipe again. Thanks!

This was good.  I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder at another reviewer's suggestion and it turned out like a dense cake.  I suspect I'd have liked it even denser (like banana bread), but I was in the mood for cake.  That did the trick.  I added a few fun things (almond extract, coconut extract, chocolate chips), but this recipe would stand on its own as is.

This was an easy recipe to make...whipped it up in less than 5 minutes! It was also very good. I baked mine a tad too long, so it was a bit dry, but that was my fault, not the recipe's. I will make this recipe again for sure.

I also made this in a bundt pan.  It is very good, but mine also turned out more like banana bread.  I hand mixed it, so next time I'll use the Kitchenaid and maybe add the extra tsp of baking soda.  I frosted it with the Creamy Frosting recipe from this site.  Got lots of compliments!

I made this a long time ago & would give the recipe, as is, 3 1/2 stars.  The changes I made this time around made this a 5 star, healthier cake.  I used 1/2 c. white, 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I used 2 bananas plus one 8 oz. can crushed pineapple w/ juice.  When I added the wet ingred. to the creamed sugar/butter mixture I used an elec. mixer and beat quite a bit of air into it.  For the flour I used 1 1/4 C. white, 1/2 c. wheat & 1/4 c. flax.  Everything else as written.  Frosted w/ a thin layer (half recipe) of cream cheese frosting.  YUM!!!

This cake was very good but I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan and I should have checked it after 25 minutes as it was just slightly dryer than I would have liked. I used pecans as I did not have walnuts. I did top it with the banana nut frosting on this site submitted by Rosemary and it was great on this cake with the coconut adding some flavor other than just all banana.  Good cake recipe and I will try it again.

Excellent recipe to do, very easy, and tastes great. I as advised by another reviewer creamed butter and sugar really well and then added eggs and beat some more then added bananas and flour, ect. It was light yet like a bread so we had a piece for afernoon tea with butter spread on it.

I may have used more of the mashed bananas than the recipe called for, but other than that I followed the recipe. This came out just like banana bread for me, but its definitely good! Just not very cake-like.

I don't like to give bad reviews, but this one was not for me. Had a ton of black bananas in my fridge for baking, decided to try something different from banana bread. Found this recipe and tried it. I followed the recipe exactly, the cake was dry and lacked flavor. I checked the cake at 25 min (instead of 30) and it was overdone. Will not make again.

What's the surprise?  The flavor was good, recipe was easy but the cake itself was dry.  I followed the exact directions, only using cake flour, as others had advised.  Maybe, because I used a 9x5x2 pan...wanted a little thicker than what the picture showed.  Might try again, but still looking for a better one.

My family loves this cake!  I haven't tried it with icing on it, I usually sprinkle powdered sugar on it before I serve it.  I've brought this to many potlucks and usually have to give people the recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and this cake came out very good and moist. It is a little like banana bread, but not dry. Will make this again.

This cake was a bit heavier and drier than I expected, more like banana bread in a pan than a light, moist cake. I baked it in a glass pan and I think it was a bit overdone; perhaps I'll back off the time a bit next time. My banana-loving son really enjoyed this. We iced it with Caramel Frosting from this site.

This was a quick and delicious cake!  I used 5 bananas and added a coconut and oatmeal streusel/crumb layer in the middle and on top in place of icing.  I'll definitely make it again!
