The baking time was way off for me, expect a much longer baking time.  Also, it made 5 and not four desserts depending on the size of your custard cups. I wanted to use up some white chocolate chips that had being hanging around way too long and despite the stabilizing they are made with, it worked out fine.  All that being said, this was amazing.  It was creamy and absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe.
