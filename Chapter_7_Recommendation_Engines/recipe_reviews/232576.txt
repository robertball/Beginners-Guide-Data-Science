Prepared just as written (or it wouldn't be the same recipe, would it?) In 29 years I have never made my husband meatloaf because he always said he didn't like it but he wolfed this down, went back for seconds and finished off for lunch next day!

I used spinach instead of mushrooms and 3 egg yolks instead of one whole because they were left over from previous baking.  I also put bbq sauce on top when I drained it after 30 minutes.  Nice and moist, baked up really well.  I will experement with different cheeses when I make this again.

This is the exact recipe I've used from time to time, the only difference being the stuffing I use.  Instead of mushroom/onion/cheddar stuffing I've always used thinly sliced Italian salami, thinly sliced provolone cheese and a couple of sliced hard-boild eggs.  It is just very wonderful as is but often I will make it and roast it in the oven then plunk it into my homemade spaghetti sauce for about 15 minutes or so and serve it instead of meatballs with spaghetti.  My mom always made this and it was considered "company meatloaf", named in Italian, "Polpetone". which translates literally to big meat ball!  It really is an Italian favorite with "Sunday gravy" when the whole family and some friends gather.

This was fine, but not a keeper.  It was pretty bland as written.

Followed recipe but came out way too dry.  Knew when mixing that this was going to be the case, so added additional milk to moisten meat.  Didn't help.  Served with ketchup just to moisten meat some but definitely won't make this again.

Made it the first time by the book. AWSOME Made it the second time got carried away layer of onion and mushroom layer of baby spinach  layer extra sharp cheese layer of spinach and mushroom and onion. Tough to role up over stuffed the pan little extra time cooking and it was awesome  but Ill stick to the original and it makes great sandwiches.

I made this tonight and I have to say it was one of the best meatloaves I've ever had. I didn't add the garlic  and I just used half a pack of regular mushrooms. I also added a half small can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions. During the last 40 minutes I added a couple slices of bacon on top! DELISOUS
