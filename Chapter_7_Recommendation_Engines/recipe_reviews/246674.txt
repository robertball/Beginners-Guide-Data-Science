They got a bit too puffy and lost a bit of the "bunny " look as they baked....   Don't know if it it's how I rolled them or what.

You definitely need store-bought cinnamon rolls to do this, or at least use a recipe in which the dough comes out really flat. I used a cinnamon roll recipe that yielded a very puffy dough, which is difficult to shape into a bunny in the first place, and it loses what definition it had after it's been baked (looks like a blob).
