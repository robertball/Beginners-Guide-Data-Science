I made these cookies for a Mexican themed dinner at a local concert-in-the-park. They were wonderful. I did make the mistake of serving them alongside some empanadas which were very sweet. The sweetness made these seem bland. Today, I tried it again and wow!!! They were wonderful. I also wonder if the flavor blended more the next day? I had a mom in my daughter's class (who is from Mexico) try one and she loved it. She said her mom would also sprinkle powdered sugar on these for looks. I really didn't find them to be any more labor intensive than making sugar cookies. When others find out that you soaked anise seeds in rum, they label you as a great cook! I think I'll take that title and run with it! I will def. keep this recipe. Thank you Ruben!

These are very mellow cookies...they have just enough spice to taste it but you might like a little more punch!  Very good though.

These are great, delicate little tea cookies. Yum! I made them exactly as stated in the recipe, except that it seemed to work a lot better to remove them from the baking sheet right away. (I let the first batch cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes and some of them cracked when I removed them.) Five stars for this unique recipe!

This was such fun to make. The dough came together easily, rolled out easily, and produced a tender cookie. It made 5 dozen 2 1/2-inch great-tasting cookies. I used Bacardi light.

These tasted great and melted in your mouth. But they were not pretty to look at and very crumbly in texture. The cookies fell apart very easyily, so they were difficult to store or present on a cookie tray. I think that rolling them out thicker would be better. Or, since the dough was so sticky, maybe skip the whole rolling the dough out part and just make them into balls and flatten a bit with a fork or a glass.

OH RUBEN!!!  I wish I could give these more stars.  These are a MUST TRY for every baker that loves the taste of anise.  Followed the recipe except ran out of all purpose flour so had to use 1/4 whole wheat flour to make the 2.5 cups and had to flour my board w/the wheat flour and they still came out beautiful! Didn't have ground clove so  had about 1/2 tsp. allspice left in my container so used that.  Soaked the seeds last night and by this morning they had absorbed all the rum.  The anise is not overpowering but yet it is there.  Made these into hearts for Valentine's day and going to ice them "Sugar Cookie Icing" (submitted by Janice Brubaker here on Allrecipes) and add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the glaze so as not to 'steal' anything from the taste of this wonderful creation.  I am the world's worst cookie 'roller' and these rolled out beautifully and cut well.  Very sturdy cookie.  These are just the best!  Reminds me of a good pizelle.  Could leave out the bit of clove and still have the best cookie.  This is probably the best cookie recipe I have ever tried on here and I have tried many good ones. thank you so much for a recipe that I shall use for years to come.

These are great.  If you like butter cookies, you'll love these.  Very light and delicate and not too sweet.  I made them for a Cinco De Mayo luncheon we had at work today (I know, it's only May 4th. LOL).  I made them exactly like the recipe except I made the dough last night and baked them off this morning.  I used real butter so the dough was quite stiff after being in the fridge all night.  I bet these would be great rolled into a log and sliced off.  They were easy to roll out and baked off beautifully.  I sprinkled a little sugar on top for sparkle as another reviewer suggested.  I found out that "Borrachio" or "Borracho" means "drunk" or "drunken".  I thought that was really cute given the rum in the recipe.

I made one batch and ate them all.  I had to make another to share with friends.  They are like a shortbread cookie and so yummy.  I added a little anise oil to mine because I love the flavor.  I know I will be making these again and again and again.

I did not care for this recipe. My husband is Guatemalan and LOVES Anise, and was more than unimpressed.

Simple, fast and easy. Very tasty! I exchanged the rum with red wine and instead of cloves and anis seed i used a mixture of cinnamon, anis, cloves, piment and ginger. The dough is great for freezing or keeping in the fridge for one or two days. Great for kids or for christmas cookie parties where everyone can join and make some individual cut-out cookies. My variation of the cookies tastes a lot like the German "Spekulatius" cookies.

this was an excellent cookie, tender texture, nice flavor. the texture and flavor developed over a few days, they tasted better than the first day. I made them with real butter and used Myers dark rum, I sandwiched them with a buttercream frosting using dark rum as the liquid, and powdered the top. When I brought them to work with a Christmas cookie assortment, my coworkers said they were "the bomb!"

Very Unique is what my husband said and I agree.  I think I will make these every Christmas!  I frosted these with a butter frosting with some rum flavoring mixed in (could use straight rum if you rather).  The only problem I had with these is that I couldn't stop eating the scraps from the cut-outs!  I bet it would have made more cookies if I wouldn't have ate the dough!

I've only made these once, but they turned out quite well. They are pretty mild and/or bland, so keep that in mind when serving them (or even when making them.) I was worried about the anise flavor. I like it, but I can't stand it when it's too strong. It's pretty mild in these cookies, so if you're a huge fan, I think you could definitely safely add quite a bit more.  I don't have a rolling pin (I know...) so I rolled pieces up into small logs, sliced them off, then pressed them with the bottom of a glass on a floured surface. It didn't look quite as nice as it would have with a cookie cutter, but it was quick and easy so if presentation doesn't matter to you, that's an option. Next time I might add a little more rum and/or anise. Oh, yeah, I also didn't marinate the seeds over night. I guess it's probably more delicious if you do that.

These are really good cookies. I made a batch today. followed the recipe except for modification of the cloves (1/2 tsp cloves to 1 tsp allspice) I will certainly make them again very soon but will sub anise extract for the seeds as a try.I use the things I bake as gifts to the neighborhood kids (and their parents)and the people who work in my dentist and doctor's office. This one is definitely a keeper. Makes about 50 1" cookies. I bake on parchment so they never stick.

I cut down the flour by 1/4 cup and did away with cookie cutters after reading the other reviews.  They turned out wonderful and did not crumble. They actually resembled "Lace Cookies" when they were finished.

I followed Heidi's suggestions for the modified recipe.  Instead of rolling the dough out, I placed a tablespoon of dough onto a parchment sheet.  With my cookie stamp or the bottom of a juice glass I pressed out the cookie.  After dipping the stamp or glass into granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. This is a flavorful cookie with a shortbread texture.  Thank you for sharing this delectable cookie recipe.

I followed the directions that one person suggested to save having to roll out the dough. Worked like a charm. Also used half the amounts of anise and clove for a more e subtle flavor.

I dusted them with powdered sugar and they are good. Not fantastic but good.
