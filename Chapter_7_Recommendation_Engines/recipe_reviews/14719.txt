You can bake this recipe if you want to prepare it and walk away for an hour or so.  Bake covered at 300 degrees F.  Also, I enhanced the seasonings by rubbing each chop with a blend of cardomom, ground ginger, salt and pepper prior to browning.  My kids and husband RAVED about the finished product.

I only had fresh peaches, so I modified the recipe a bit and it came out just fine. I used 1c. OJ + 1t ground ginger and fresh peaches as the "sauce", omitting the brown sugar entirely. I also only did two chops instead of four, so there was more sauce per serving. Fantastic, and fast.

My husband absolutely raves whenever I make this dish.  I use fresh peaches and substitute orange juice for the canned peach juice. My son (age 1) won't eat the meat yet,  but he'll eat the peaches!

Can I give this one six stars?  It was super easy, fast, and a nice way to change up the usual pork chop dinner.  Based on other suggestions, I added about 1 1/2 tsp garlic and about 2 tbs of soy sauce, and bit more ginger.  YUM!!!!  I did find that the sauce didn't thicken very much, perhaps because I used 2 15 oz. cans of peaches and reserved a good amount of the peaches for snacking... I added a touch of cornstarch to the sauce and the result was perfection!  I'd definitely recommend this to the busy weekday cook who needs a new way to jazz up pork chops.

For people experimenting with pork recipes, do not be afraid of fruit and pork... something about pork just makes it delicious with sweet.  This is an awesome dish and I wouldn't change a thing!! I've made this a regular dish at home because its so simple and the kids love it!

Great base recipe! Like other reviewers suggested, I added a few things: 2 tbsp soy sauce, 3 cloves minced garlic, , and 1 tsp cinnamon. Also, after the 15 minutes of cooking down, I removed the pork and added a water/corn starch mixture -- mixed before adding to pan (1/4c water to 2 tbsp corn starch). Absolutely yum!!!

My husband and I were looking for something different and we stumbled across this recipe.  I thought I had peaches, but used apricots instead.  The recipe was very easy and still very good with the apricots.  Since our 14 month old daughter was eating this too I cut the ginger down to 1/2 tsp and it had just enough of the ginger taste to get her used to it.  Thank you very much for a wonderful recipe.  This has already been requested by my husband, and only one week later!!!

Well ... :D ... it didn't "work" for the kids.  They couldn't get a grip on fruit & pork chops together.  It was bland as others have said.  I kind of expected that though since  I didn't add any ginger, just brown sugar a little maple syrup (after thickening it wasn't sweet enough I thought).  It took two tablesppons cornstarch.  It also took much, much, MUCH longer than 15 to 20 minutes to get those babies tender & I didn't even use thick chops.

This was really good. I followed the recipe all the way but added some cinnamon. My sauce never did thicken but it was still very tasty and the white rice I served it with soaked the sauce up nicely.

LOVE this recipe!  Super quick and easy to make.  I used 3 fresh peeled peaches instead of canned as well since they are so good right now and I also added 2 peeled Sweet Fruits.  I also used 1 cup of orange juice instead of the canned juice and it turned out awesome.  A great summer recipe!

A great busy day recipe.  Easy, not many ingredients, and very good.  Not a real "complex" tasting recipe, but definitely worth making again.

I used 4 chops, used a 15 oz can of peaches, took others advice and added garlic and soy sauce and some orange juice. Browned in skillet then baked in oven 300 degrees for 1 hour. Will be making again for sure! We served it over medium egg noodles and there was plenty of sauce. Great dinner!!!

My husband was excited about this before I cooked it.  After dinner he decided it was too bland and doesn't want me to make it again.  I think it was very good, but felt like I needed to have a bite of peach with every piece of meat other wise the pork by itself was plain tasting.  The peaches and sauce were very tasty and I enjoyed it.  I cooked slightly longer as I had really thick chops, but the sauce thickened up nicely and weren't tough.

Great recipe!!!  I didn't need to add anything.  Pork Chops came out Very tender & moist, and the sauce was Awesome.  Next time I think I'll double up on the sauce to pour over some rice.  Very Flavorful!!

We had this version for dinner last night,except I made it with a pork roast in my slow cooker.
I also added balsamic vinegar to balance the sweetness just a bit(2tbsp) we really liked the flavour
of the sauce but the roast turned out a little dry ( 6hrs on high ) will only cook for 5 hrs next time. I still would give five stars for easy, tasty and hands off.

These are very good. I do not care for ginger, so I substituted 2 Tlbsps of Maple Syrup. The pork was very tender and the peaches gave the pork a great flavor. Next time, I'd like to try some kind of orange flavor or pineapple flavor along with the peaches.

I thought this was pretty good, I definitely like the idea of sweet fruit with pork.  I used canned peaches with real syrup and after 15-20 minutes they turned to mush which the kids didn't care for.  I think I could have added the peaches later to keep them more firm and just warmed through.  Also the sauce was not as thick as I hoped after 20 minutes but the rice soaked it up nicely.

I don't know what else to say about this except...it's wonderful!! I decided to try it only after being tired of regular baked, fried, and grilled pork chops.  My 5 year old and husband said that it's a keeper.  We had this served with white rice and garlic green beans.  Fantastic!!

Served over white rice.  Very easy, but my sauce never thickened.  I'm not a fan of porked chops, but my boyfriend is and he liked it a lot.

I made this dish as written and found it to be bland, maybe because I have other pork recipes with fruit that I feel have more complex flavors going on.  Thank you

Maybe I just have too many delicious recipes for porkchops but I was not overly impressed with this recipe. Nevertheless, it was easy to make and worth trying. It had a nice flavor, but I will probably not be adding this to my recipe box.

Although the concept is a good one, the combination of pork, peaches and ginger did NOT work in our household.

I loved this recipe.  Made it for a boyfriend who's pretty picky and he like it too.  It was so easy to make and very tasty.  I made sure I had a piece of peach with every bite!  Served it with wild rice and steamed asparagus.  When I made it though, the liquid didn't seem to reduce nor thicken.  Was still delicious though. I'd make it again!

The men in my family enjoyed this dish very much. Normally anything with fruit sounds to healthy for them so they automatically don't like it. This one was victorious. Amazing cooks on this web site.Thanks to all of you .God Bless

This was simply delicious. I made a few very minor adjustments. I used about half the amount of brown sugar called for, as some people thought it was too sweet, I added fresh minced ginger to the peach juice, & sprinkled powdered ginger & freshly ground pepper on the chops before browning them. My husband & I loved them. This is sure to become a favourite! Thank you Betty for an excellent recipe!!

VERY GOOD!  I only had the smaller cans of fruit (15oz) in my cupboard, and after starting the meat on the stove, I realized I only had one can of peaches.  I decided to use a can of pears too to make up for the missing peaches and juice.  I will bet this made the recipe much better for those who said it was too sweet.  I will try it next time as written, but it was excellent using both fruits.  Excellent recipe and I will use it often!  Thanks.

I really liked this recipe.  It is not something that I would usually make, but I wanted to try something different.  It was really good.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe and really liked it.  The second time I used pineapple instead if peaches and I didn't like it as well.  I will use peaches from now on.

I loved it, taking the suggestions of others regarding adding more spice and a little cornstarch for thickening. Even my teenager liked it! I added a bit of garlic salt, cinnamon and ginger to the spice rub prior to frying, and then chopped up two dried chili peppers and a little more  garlic to the sauce as it simmered. Easy-peasy and SO good!  Thanks, Waybet!

My family LOVED this.  As we have peach trees in our yard, I used fresh peaches and used orange juice for the sauce.  Only thing that I'm not sure about is why my sauce didn't thicken...doesn't matter though - it was great!!  Served with a rice medley and veg.

Very good, added chopped yellow bell pepper at the same time as the peaches. Next time I will probably add a little more ginger because I like the taste of ginger which was a little hidden in the sweetness of the peach.

This just wasn't our thing.  Both my husband and I think this recipe didn't do anything for either the pork chops or the peaches.  Maybe I could try it with orange juice like others have suggested, but we really just weren't that impressed.  Sorry.

I used this recipt to use up some fresh peaches I had that were getting soft.  Like other reviewers suggested, I used OJ for the liquid and also added soy sauce.  The chops were ready before the sauce thickened so I took them out, turned up the heat on the sauce, and thickened it with a bit of cornstarch. This had a very nice flavor!

This is pretty good as is, but I think a bit sweet for my taste and use only half the brown sugar now.  I also have made it with sweet curry instead of ginger - both are delish.

This recipe was "good, but not my favorite," as my husband said.  If I make it again, I will be adding some more spices, as I found this a bit bland.  I will say that the peaches and pork went well together.

I went with the suggestions of a couple of the other reviews and added more ginger and some soy sauce. Also  used home cannned peaches in light syrup . Served with white rice .

I thought the recipes was good in theory, something different and fruity that can be tweaked to meet ones personal tastes.
It won't make its way into my dinner rotation because I was the only one who enjoyed the recipe at my table.  Its worth trying though!

I followed the recipe as given, but thought it was a little 'blah'.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor to it; it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough for me to want to make it again either.

I followed the advice of one review and added soy sauce and garlic. My husband loved it and he hates peaches. I used a quart jar of home canned peaches in light syrup. It was a hit and now will be a standard recipe in my house.

They were good. I would prefer bonless next time. The flavor was good though. I'm usually not a fan of mixing fruit with food like this, but this was really good.

This was okay.  I didn't love the flavor of this dish and neither did my husband.  For a great fruit-pork recipe, try the Caramel Apple Pork Chops, also on this site.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I BOTH love this dish, the sauce is sweet and tangy and adds a great flavor to the pork chops!  I'm definitely keeping this recipe to cook for the next time my parents are down to visit, my father is a gourmet chef and I don't doubt for a minute that he'll love this scrumptious recipe!

This recipe turned out quite good, I only wished I'd let it simmer longer than 45 minutes, it would have made very tender chops.  Thanks for the recipe.

My first disappointment... I love peaches, i also love pork, so i thought this recipe will be great. But i expected more tenderness and flavor, it was too bland for me. It's was OK. Quick and easy to make, but i wouldn't hurry to make it again.

I know that most of the reviews for this recipe are positive, and I am sure it works for some, but I really did not like the taste of the pork and the peaches together.  A word to those picky eaters, the pork/peaches combo tasted a bit greasy for me and the thought of it now makes my stomach turn.  Hopefully those who would not be detered by that will investigate this recipe for themselves.

I was looking for a new way to prepare pork and stumbled upon this recipe. The peaches complimented the pork very well and was excellent when served with wild rice. After reading that the recipe might be too sweet, I cut down the amount of brown sugar just a little, and it turned out great.
