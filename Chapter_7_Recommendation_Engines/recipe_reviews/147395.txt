I made this salad to take to a holiday dinner, but I made it first just for my family to make sure that we liked it.  I made a recipe to serve 6. When I took the salad to the holiday dinner I increased the recipe to serve 12, but I still made the dressing according to the recipe for 6 and there was plenty of dressing for the larger amount of salad ingredients.

 This is our new favorite salad recipe.  I was a little hesitant when I started pricing walnut oil at the grocery stores, but I saw it at three different stores for 3 different prices ranging from $3.99-$11.95.  I would definitely use the walnut oil and not substitute another type of oil.  I can't wait to find more recipes calling for walnut oil.  It really adds a nice touch.

Cha-ching!  I loved this - everyone loved it.  Only thing I did differently is I subbed honey for the maple syrup which I always do when it's called for in any recipe and I used just a bit less brown sugar.  I can't stand the flavor of maple syrup anywhere but on my pancakes.  This dressing was excellent, unique and complimented the ingredients of this salad perfectly.  This will be made often.  Thanks Sperl25.

Better than 5 stars!!! I made this salad exactly as it's listed and it was awesome. I had a ton of dressing left over. Since there are so many great ingredients and flavors in this salad a little bit of dressing went a long way. All of the ingredients in this salad complimented each other. I will pass this recipe off to my friends and definitely make again.

This is my favorite salad to make but definitely just use half the dressing or it is too 'soupy' and lettuce will become wilted.  I don't keep walnut oil on hand so I use olive oil in the dressing and it is just fine.   I make this as a main course by adding about 1/4 cup dried cherries or cranberries, torn rotisserie chicken that I pick up at the store, and serve it with a baked sweet potato.  For the candied pecans, I use the Spicy Mixed Nuts from this site.  It's an easy and delicious meal that doesn't keep me in the kitchen after working all day.

My family and I love this recipe with a few simple adjustments.  First, we double the amount of salad because the amount of dressing this makes is way too much for just one bag.  Or we refrigerate the unused dressing a air tight container.  Second, I don't use the red onion.  Third, and most importantly, I just use 1/6 cup of apple cider vinegar or the flavor is overwhelming.  Oh and baby greens or spring mix are the best mixes for this salad.

I made this salad for a gathering and it was the hit of the meal. Everyone asked for the recipe and on a scale of 1 to 10 said it was an 11.  Here are my modifications. I did not candy the pecans. Just roasted at 375 for about 6-8 minutes. I had to switch the cheese to feta for one person, and I think blue cheese would be better, but for those who don't like blue cheese, this is still a great option.  I also used light mayo, but did buy roasted walnut oil and pure maple syrup for the dressing.  The second time around I don't think pure maple syrup is necessary. And EVOO could be fine as a substitute for the walnut oil, but maybe not quite as good. It makes enough for more than two salads, but I can't wait to eat some tonight with dinner. Really yummy.  It may be my new go-to salad recipe!

I looked for this recipe after having something similar at a fancy French dinner party. I made the recipe as is, with the exception of roasting the pear slices in the oven. It's a little extra work, but I think the flavor and "wow" factor are definitely worth it! I thinly sliced the pears, sprayed both sides with olive oil from a can (or you could brush or toss with olive oil), and layed them in a single layer in a 9 X 13 baking dish. Cooked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, turned, and cooked for another 5 minutes. Those are the times that worked in my oven, but I would suggest keeping an eye on them. I cooked them until they were tender and just beginning to brown/caramelize. I fanned four pear slices out on top of each salad for a pretty garnish and delicious flavor! This salad is AWESOME. You feel more like you're eating a dessert than a salad. I did have leftover dressing, but it didn't last long. Yum!

I have made this salad, but used Poppyseed Dressing in a bottle.  Found that using 1/2 bottle was just right.  For those who don't want to go to the trouble of making their own dressing, this is a quick and delicious option and you can control how much dressing to use. I've also used Bartlett and Anjou pears as well.

This is so good. So simple and will impress everyone you serve it to.  I omit the onions because of personal taste. The candied pecans are my favorite part of the salad.

New recipe, but every time I have served it guests have asked for the recipe.  Good dressing and it makes enough for additional uses.

Excellent salad! I diced the pear, and had to leave out the cheese to accomodate a special request, and it was still delicious and popular -- the guests all wanted more. I was afraid the dressing would be too sweet, but it was a perfect balance.

This is quite good.  The flavors really work well together.  People that don't normally like salad ask for seconds of this --even after the main course!  The dressing makes a lot though.  Can re-use for other salads or cut in half would be plenty.

I don't usually comment on recipes. But this one is so Awesome I had to! I really don't want anything for dinner except this salad. Maybe lunch, too! I didn't add the pear, which I am sure would make it even better. I totally forgot. And I used olive oil because it is what I had. I bought already candied pecans at Trader Joes and chopped them. definitely something I will make many times. Maybe even for Superbowl!! Go HAWKS!!!!!

Great. My BF loved it and kept making compliments as he was eating.  I made some adjustments:  used only red lettuce, didn´t add any oil to the dressing, since I thought it was enough with the mayo, mixed the dressing in a glass bottle and served it there so everyone could put the dressing as liked.  Now I have enough dressing for another salad.  Thanks

Delicious! The dressing is to die for - my guests were asking for the recipe. I've had variations of this salad before, but never this good. The onions, in moderation, add a nice flavor to balance out all the sweetness. Yum!

I had a very similar salad a few nights ago and it called to make your own caramelized pecans. I did 1 cup of pecans, 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1.5 tbsp of water. You mix it in a pot until it's caramelized. They turned out AMAZING! But I was thinking next time I'd try maybe adding a little brown sugar and cinnamon. You could also try adding some honey that is a little watered down. Anyway, I use pink lady apples instead of pears and gorgonzola instead of blue cheese. Pink ladies are the best type of apple, i use them in salads and sandwiches all the time. they aren't tart like other apples. anyway, great recipe!

This salad was incredible!  It was the first time I've ever made dressing from scratch and it was one of my favorite dressings ever.  I did, however, substitute the maple syrup with honey. I'm very grateful for the reviews with that suggestion because I also believe maple syrup should be for pancakes and nothing else.

This dressing is delicious! I got nothing but rave reviews. Goes quite well with the pears and cheese. I used leftovers on salmon over mixed greens and it was amazing. This dressing will be a new favorite at our house. I didn't find it too sweet, though I used walnuts instead of candied pecans. I didn't want to buy walnut oil, so used grapeseed and found it substituted just fine.

Just made this salad and dressing with a few changes.  Baked pears for 15 min. at 400 and used provolone (didn't have blue cheese).  Made the Candy Coated Pecans from Allrecipes.  Made dressing exact except for used olive oil (didn't have walnut oil).  Pour dressing in a cruet and it filled it!  This is a great salad, can add extra ingredients like croutons, cranberries, etc.  I don't really like maple syrup but is a perfect dressing.  I had thought about changing it and then decided to make it as exact as I could to give a proper rating.  I may try to find walnut oil and roquefort cheese.  Just try it as is!  Thank you SPERL25!

This was fantastic!  I didn't have candied pecans and couldn't find a recipe for them so I just toasted them in a skillet.  I made it for my sister-in-law's birthday dinner and she loved it and asked for the recipe. Both of us have already shared it with others.  Definately will make this again and again!

When I first read this recipe, I nearly passed on making the salad dressing because I wasn't sure about dressing made with maple syrup.  Thankfully I tried it anyway, because by doing so I found what is my favorite salad recipe by a mile!  This dressing is out of this world delicious!  It does not taste like maple syrup on salad - it is just a wonderful blend of spicy and sweet.   I made this salad for 3-4 parties during the Christmas season, and every time this salad was completely devoured and folks were asking me for the recipe.  A permanent favorite for me.

I added apple and omitted the pecans. I used olive oil. It was great... My husband said he thought we were in a restaurant...

I changed the recipe quite a bit, but loved it still. The dressing, for which I used plain yoghurt instead of mayo and grapeseed oil instead of walnut oil, was fabulous. It was a little sweet so I would perhaps cut back (just a little!) the amounts of maple syrup and sugar next time. For the salad I tossed romaine lettuce with red onion, blackberries and bleu cheese crumbles. The berries offered a nice texture contrast that I'm not sure the pears, unless diced, could have. We decided to put this in a bread bowl because we were missing Perkin's discontinued bread bowl salad, and I have to say this was superb that way. The dressing still had a little tang to it on the breadbowl and was great. It was all very quick too, I'd easily recommend this as a last minute dinner.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! The dressing is absolutely amazing and please do not substitute the walnut oil -it is worth every penny. I will only be making this salad from now on.

Terrific combination for a salad.  I used arugula instead of field greens because I was serving with grilled beef.

I've made this salad probably 5 times now and everyone I've served it to LOVES it. I don't have walnut oil, so I've only ever made it with almond oil, but it's super delicious!

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone LOVED it. The pears are a great pairing with ham and this recipe  was a crowd face. I did not use walnut oil but i will next time.  EVOO was a good substitute.  My family thought it was delicious. I used feta instead of blue cheese because I like a milder cheese. I will make this again.

4.5 Stars: The dressing seemed unusual, but I like unusual.  I think a balsamic vinaigrette or something of that type would be just as good and not have the mayo.  I left out the onion, but did candy almonds since that is what I had.  That was a first and I really enjoyed the pear and blue cheese.

I usually double the "stuff" that goes on this salad b/c I like a lot of stuff on my lettuce. The dressing is great. Well worth buying walnut oil if you don't already have it. I use the Sugar Coated Pecans recipe from this site for the nuts.

Oh man, was this good! I could totally drink the dressing, lol! I had a feeling that I was gonna LOVE this, and I was right. Made exactly as written, and would not change a thing...EXCELLENT! All of the flavors paired perfectly together. This is going into my salad rotation for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Since I didn't have walnut oil, I substituted toasted walnuts for the candied pecans.  The salad was delicious, and the dressing sweet/tangy.

Absolutely delicious! My husband doesn't like blue cheese so I used our local grocery's brand of "four cheese Italian." (Mozzarella, Provolone, Parmesan, Romano) I also didn't have walnut oil and used light olive oil instead. Overall, it still was outstanding! Proof from my very picky eater hubby: "Is there more?" We have plenty of dressing now and I think we just may have this salad again tomorrow night! Thanks for a great recipe. It's going into my regular rotation. :-)

Fantastic salad.  Made it for a summer party and have  people begging for the recipe.  Only change in the recipe that I've done is less red onion, used honey instead of maple syrup, and used olive oil instead of walnut oil.  Incredible!  Will make again and again and again!  Thanks SPERL25!

This is a wonderful salad.  The dressing is top notch.  I had almost everyone asking me for the recipe at a party I made this for.  I've made it quite a few times now.  I do think that using miracle whip light makes a big difference.  The one time I used another mayo, it just did not taste right.  I've always used the walnut oil as stated in the recipe. You will not be disappointed with this salad. It tastes like your dining in a fancy restaurant!

Well,, I am one off those annoying people that change a recipe all up.. hehe,, but at least I didn't change it all up and then give it a bad rating :) This was WONDERFUL,, the dressing scared me,, it smelled like vinegar,, DON'T worry,, its wonderful,, I didn't change a thing on the dressing,, but in the salad,, I used green apple instead of pears, added sliced strawberries, and halfed huge red grapes, and got REALLY good blue cheese from the market and crumbled it,, SO YUMMY!!!

This was a great recipe and quick to make.  It is my new staple when I have to go to a potluck.  The recipe makes way more dressing that you need, and a little bit goes a long way with this salad.  I cut the ingredients in half so I don't end up with too much (but it does keep ok if you do make the full amount).  I followed the recipe very closely and it turned out great!!!

This was just as good as I had hoped it would be.  The dressing is enough for double the salad.  Don't put it on too soon as it tends to wilt the salad if not served right away.  A real keeper!

Great salad! I used a green onion instead of the red since that what I had. I subsituted nonfat Greek yogurt for the mayo and the dressing was wonderful. I cooked my pecans in a pan, sprinkled some sugar and poured some maple syrup to make the candied pecans. Yum!! Ate this salad two days in a row.

I double everything except the dressing since I had 10 guests to feed--EVERYONE from my 6 year old daughter to the guests from South Africa and Monaco raved and asked for the recipe and for seconds.  This salad was a request from my husband for his birthday dinner.  I had to make the sugar pecans, and was lucky to have a dribble of maple syrup left! "BEST SALAD EVER!!" said my 16 year old son.

Instead of using candied peacans I bought sliced almonds and candied them myself with sugar and a little bit of butter and it turned out great!!

Eventhough I would like to try it with a balsamic-based dressing. I'll try it and keep you posted.

This salad is outstanding!  I took it to a dinner party and everyone gushed over it.  The flavors pair beautifully.  Don't deviate from the recipe as it's perfect as written.  And by all means, do not sub out the Walnut Oil.  It's what makes it. Needless to say, it got more attention than the main course.  A definite keeper.

I made this recipe a little more easier and did not use a blender to mix ingredients.  Just used a dressing shaker container from Tupperware.  Delicious and easy to make!  Will definitely make again!

This is outstanding!  The dressing is so unique, simple, and delicious!  All the Flavors go so well together.
I was making this the night before for an event the next day and was worried about the pears browning.  I soaked them in a mixture of 2T. honey  in 1 cup water.  They kept perfectly white for over 24 hours!  YUM!!

I made this salad for a Christmas party and everyone wanted to know the recipe.
I did make a few changes, some changes were personal preference and some were ingredient substitutes because I couldn't find the right ingredient.
I am not crazy about blue cheese so I substituted gorganzola for a slightly less twangy flavor. I also prefer salad dressing over mayonnaise so I substituted Light Miracle Whip.
I didn't locate Walnut oil, but I had a high grade cold press olive oil that I used instead. Finally I did not have candied pecans but I had honey roasted peanuts that I used. Since peanuts have a less preferable flavor and texture I used less nuts than called for.

I do think that pecans would be better, however the outcome was still wonderful and light. 

Great recipe! I will definitely try it again.

This is fantastic! I made everything as listed; the dressing was just perfect. I brought it to a dinner party and it was the dish everyone commented on. As others said, for this size salad you only need about half the dressing the recipe makes.

In place of the walnut oil, I used EVOO and went a little heavier with it. Great dressing for this type of salad. The candied pecans I used had some spice to them, and that just added another dimension of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, SPERL25! Just love these large, healthy salads for lunch or dinner!

I didn't have red onion, so I omitted that.  I also subbed olive oil instead of walnut oil.  I didn't have any and didn't want to make a special trip just for one item.  WOW, WOW, WOW!  I am in love with this salad.  Try it and you won't be sorry.

I made this recipe for a cook-off between a friend and I, and it was delicious! Everybody loved it and kept asking for the recipe. I had never tried walnut oil before, but it was definitely delicious in this recipe. I just used some pears that I had canned myself for the pears, giving this salad a beautiful personal touch. Blue cheese isn't my favorite, so I used feta instead, a great substitute!

My sister brought this for Christmas dinner exactly as the recipe states. Even those who don't normally take too many veggies loved it! It went perfect with Prime Rib, although I will make it with whatever and whenever! It does make a lot of dressing. Can cut those ingredients by half probably.

I was looking for a different salad last night and had just run across this recipe. Had a pear I needed to use up so, voila. OMG, this is so good and the dressing is wonderful. I didn't have walnut oil, so used the same amount of EVOO and it was still excellent. I also used butter lettuce, but I think this recipe is pretty forgiving. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!!! I used candied pecans  (because I cant find candied walnuts anymore at my store) and they were tasty. I also used Gorgonzola instead of Blue Cheese--same thing essentially, but Gorgonzola has a creamier, milder taste. Dont skip the walnut oil; it adds so much to this recipe. My husband LOVED it!  A keeper!

I've made this salad seven or eight times and taken it to group dinners. Each time, everyone raves about the flavor combinations and elegance of this salad. The first time that I made it, I didn't have walnut oil. When I made it using the walnut oil, it was superb! My family could tell the difference, so now I keep walnut oil in the fridge just for this salad.

This was actually very good! I was afraid the blue cheese would be too strong, but the sweet dressing mellows it out some. I didn't have walnut oil so I used olive oil instead and Miracle Whip instead of plain mayo. Delicious salad. I used salad topping fried onions instead of fresh. Thanks, this was fantastic.

I didn't care much for the dressing.  I thought it was overly sweet.  My husband liked it though.  I used the "Candy Coated Pecans" recipe from allrecipes.com for this salad.  Those were good!  I like the pear-blue cheese combo, but I think I will stick to my usual dijon viniagrette dressing.

AmaZing salad and incredibly easy to make. I made the Microwave Spiced Pecans on this site, which were very easy to make and used canola oil since I didn't have the walnut oil. I served it for company and it was an immediate hit!

The salad tasted delicious!  The only modification I may make is to add more than 10 oz. of lettuce.  I may use a bag and a half (i.e., 17 oz.) next time. Other than that, this salad is wonderful!

5 stars for nothing more than the delicious salad dressing.  Would I make it again? yes, but with feta.  I am not a fan of blue cheese, although my husband liked it.  To me, the blue cheese overpowered the delicious dressing.  Also, next time I may try with some orange slices and pear.  I think a little citrus flavor would enhance overall taste.

Great easy salad! I agree the dressing is better omitting the brown sugar. I did not have walnut oil but olive oil tasted great, too. I also used plain not candied pecans. The dressing is plenty sweet for the salad I think without the addition of candied nuts. Gonna make this again!

this is awesome, sometimes if folks don't like blue cheese I sub feta cheese... and I mix candied pecans and macadamia nuts that I have made with egg whites and sugar... so yum, then you can leave out the brown sugar...

Absolutely loved this. Had two bowls one after the other. I used scallions in place of red peppers. And didn't have enough maple syrup so I used some honey. Delicious. Would be great with avocados or boiled eggs.

Really good salad.  Suggest you toast your own walnuts in a bit of walnut oil until aromatic, take off the stove and mix in some brown sugar while they are hot.  Put into a container until you need them.

Between the maple syrup, the pear, the brown sugar and the candied nuts, this is a very sweet salad. However, the apple cider vinegar and cheese add some nice contrast.

Wayyyyy tooo much dressing. Cut it at least in half. 

Update: Yep made it again and it was a stellar recipe with half the dressing. I'd probably cut the onion in half too. 

Side note, a lazy/healthier version of candied pecans is to take a tablespoon of honey and stir it in with regular pecans. Worked great for me!

Best salad ever.  I will be making it again. Only changes I made was the walnut oil (couldn’t find it so I used almond oil). Also I roasted 3 pears as one reviewer said. Thanks for the recipe.

We love this salad. Followed the recipe with a couple of changes. Pears are not in season so I just use can pears, usually an entire 15 oz. can. I also add Craisins for added color and they complement the salad perfectly.

Really great salad. The maple syrup was practically nondetectable!  It’s pretty big for only 6 people. Could easily steam tech to 8. Thr dressing make A LOT. We jarred and refrigerated about 4 oz.  Will definitely make this again.

I made it as is but would definitely suggest using less vinegar.  I used Braggs apple cider vinegar and it was very strong. Otherwise, very good recipe!

I've had this salad at a friend's house more than one time and it has been very delicious every time. I finally ask her for the recipe and I made it myself for the first time. It was really good! I love the  combination of the blue cheese with the pear and the tasty dressing.

Good recipe and will definitely repeat it. However as always, a few adjustments were necessary for our family:
-used the cheaper walnut;
- will not use brown sugar the next time, as the dressing was too sweet for my taste.  Even my wife, who is a sweet-aholic said the same.  Caveat - I am a Canuck and have found that our family who live in the US of A prefer things sweeter.
Thanks again.

This is my absolute favorite salad!  I used honey instead of maple syrup as some suggested.  You will have left over dressing but it keeps well - you can make the salad again!  It is WONDERFUL!!

This has become my all-time favorite salad dressing! It's more work to make it than buying a bottle of something off the shelf, but flavor-wise, there's no comparison. I actually crave salad now. Weird. 
Also, I've been using this site for years, and this is the first recipe I felt strongly enough about to take the time to write something about it. If you don't have apple cider vinegar on hand, white champagne vinegar is also good in it.

Don't skip the dressing, by the way, it's the best part.

Loved this salad! The dressing was amazing. I made it as the recipe said except I couldn't find walnut oil, and substituted regular oil. I am not a fan of blue cheese so made half with blue cheese for my husband and I used feta on mine.

What a delicious salad!  I did not have walnut oil on hand, so I used olive oil, and it was wonderful.  Everyone loved it!  There was plenty of dressing left over for subsequent days!  It's an amazing dressing.

Finally getting my husband to eat something other than Ceaser Salad. I did not make any changes and it was wonderful. As good as any expensive salad I have ordered in restaurants. Simple but great dressing from basic ingredients - no special grocery trips.

I made the dressing with a tablespoon of Ken's Blue Cheese dressing mixed with the apple cider vinegar and just a teaspoon of maple syrup. Just enough tang with a bit of sweet.I also added some chunks of sharp white cheddar.. Made a nice big dinner salad for one along with chicken schnitzel and baby baked potatoes. Delicious!

Everyone absolutely loved this salad! It combines several textures, looks beautiful, and hits all the tastebuds squarely! I substituted apple for the pear (due to availability), and only used 25% of the dressing (which was PLENTY). No leftovers here among three adult eaters! Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! Loved the tangy/sweet dressing. I added cooked chicken for some protein and to make it a meal-in-one.I might add cooked steak next time. Also, I might dress it up with dried cranberries. But honestly, the recipe as described with no enhancements is lovely.

I didn't find that there was too much dressing at all... and I only used a 5 oz container of salad greens!  I did serve the dressing on the side.  I think this could have used more pear, blue cheese and candied pecans!  I just used olive oil instead of buying a whole bottle of walnut oil for one recipe.

This is an old recipe, found frequently on restaurant & hotel menus for generations! However, the addition of maple syrup is new & not needed unless you have a very sweet tooth? Perhaps the difference is of a geographical nature - I am a UK subscriber & notice the very sweet nature of many US recipes.
Pear & cheese are partners made in heaven, but if you don't like pear you could substitute apple.

This salad was amazing!  Even my daughter (picky teenager) loved it.  Added some chicken to the mix to make it our complete dinner.  Will definitely add this to the fav salad list.

I have made it twice this week, once as a side dish and once as a main dish with sliced medium rare filet mignon and it was a hit. Definite go to recipe for a quick restaurant quality dinner or side.

Tangy, fresh! I made as written but then added some leftover teriyaki chicken breast and a chopped honeycrisp apple. Dressing has tang, and I wouldn't dress the salad before serving, just put the bowl out for people to drizzle on. Otherwise, it makes a ton of dressing for the amount of salad, there were 3 of us having entree salads.

Loved it! I used only a 5 oz package of Baby Romaine Mix to feed 4 adults. I had a small amount of regular pecan halves on hand and candied them myself as per the Candied Pecans recipe (by Alix) on here. I made the dressing as written, but substituted Miracle Whip for Mayonnaise. Had lots of dressing left over so I had to run out the next day and buy some more greens so we could enjoy it again.

Incredible and was loved by all.  Added more greens and another pear for a larger crowd, still did not use all the dressing as would have been too drenched.  Nice to have dressing left over for another use later anyway!    Salad was a huge hit at our potluck.  Will 100% make again.

I have made this several times, and it gets rave reviews from all.  I always ask is people like blue cheese when I invite them to dinner as some folks don't care for it.

I use Trader Joe's spicy pecans instead of the  candied pecans.  It adds a little zing to the recipe.

Love this recipe!

The dressing was delicious. I couldn't find candied pecans so just used chopped and they were equally yummy with less calories. We also added cooked cubed steaks to our salads.

Nice combo, made it for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a hit.  However since I made this salad before, I modified a few things based on it being soupy and limp after sitting for 20 minutes waiting for dinner to be ready.  There is too much dressing, and also I used a 50:50 combo of romaine and chopped kale so it can stand up to the acidic vinegar base.  I used spring greens last year, and it was just sad and limp.  Also I used olive oil instead of walnut, which worked just fine;  sweet onions instead of red because they taste better.  Finally I added dried cranberries for an additional fall touch.  Just delicious.

This was a really tasty salad. Used candied walnuts instead of pecans (I was being lazy and buying them instead of making them) and added grilled chicken (salt, pepper & lemon juice), otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up using 1/2 of the dressing, saving the remainder for another day.  We grilled some good Italian bread and made a meal of it and 3 of us ate the whole thing, with DH wishing there was more.  An excellent late summer meal for when it's too hot to cook!

GREAT! I also subbed honey for maple syrup, but did not add any brown sugar as we like our blue cheese dressing not as sweet. Will make again. I also served the dressing with a wedge of iceberg lettuce.

Wonderful salad!  I added some avocado and Bac-O's.  You could add any number of things to this classic for variation.  When I didn't have pear, I put in some apple, and that was not too bad either.

I found this recipe on this site last year and have been making it ever since. It gets rave reviews every time I serve it! Any pear will do if you can't get Bosc. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Fantastic recipe.  I used crumbled goat cheese instead of blue cheese and it was amazing, I'm sure blue cheese would be equally as good.  Perfect fall salad.....yum!

Very good, simple and quick. The dressing is the key but as others have noted, too much for the amount of salad.  Use as much as desired.

This was very tasty. I didn't include the red onion and I used olive oil instead of walnut oil. The dressing is a bit on the sweet side, so I might add a bit of dijon mustard next time as recommended by another reviewer. But the flavors all really complement each other.

This is one of the best salads I have ever made. My husband and I both like the blue cheese. Some of our friends and family don't care for blue cheese so I switch to feta on those occasions. I often keep the dressing made ahead for other salads. It is best to have a firm but fully ripened pear. I use walnut oil but I feel sure any oil will work just fine.

Super sweet!!  I loved it though - next time cut the sugar by half, or even altogether.  Cut the salt by half, used regular pecans, not candied.  The pear, maple syrup, cider vinegar and bleu cheese together is extraordinary!!!

It was really good, but there definitely was too much apple-cider vinegar for my taste. I am going to make it again and 1/2 the vinegar and see if that does the trick.

This was so delicious.  I did have to make a couple changes due to what I had on hand.  I used romaine and baby spinach for my greens.  I used regular walnuts instead of candied pecans.  I didn't have any walnut oil either so I blended some walnuts into the dressing mixture in step one until they were totally puréed..  I then used white truffle oil in place of walnut oil.  My husband was very impressed.  Can't wait to try this with the intended ingredients as per directions.

Delish!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, except that we only used about half of the dressing on the salad, and that I only used 1/8 cup of walnut oil due to the cost.  It was very good that way and I didn't notice it lacking anything.

LOVED this salad!  I made the dressing exactly as directed, but living in Central Ameria I could not find bleu cheese or Bosc pears for the salad at the local market.  However, I was able to find queso fresco cheese (similar to feta) and Ginger Gold apples which I used in place of the pears and bleu cheese.  Tasted wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe!

I was intrigued by all the high ratings for this salad. I am NOT a salad person but this was by far the best salad that I've ever put out. For this first time ever--*I* went back for seconds in lieu of the meat! Everyone at the table (okay--there were only four of us) completely devoured this salad before moving onto the rest of dinner.
Absolutely a keeper.
BTW-I did spring for the (rather) expensive walnut oil and I made the caramelized pecans that I saw in another review (1/4 cup sugar, 1.5 TBP water, 1 cup pecans) and it was fantastic.

Made this last night.  My daughter was visiting and tried it-on protest.  She started by saying.. "You know, I don't really like any of the stuff in that salad but I will try it anyway"..  She had two servings and took ingredients home to make more for lunch tomorrow! Yummm!

I've made this twice now and loved it both times. The 2nd time I took eliminated the mayo and red onion, so the kids liked it better. I missed the red onion, but I liked it better without the mayo. Also, I used olive oil instead of walnut oil the 2nd time and didn't notice enough of a difference to use the walnut. Yummy! Everyone asks for the recipe whenever I make it.

Didn't use the red onion and in place of the walnut oil I used (sweet) almond oil. The dressing was sweet; I may try adding a teaspoon of Dijon mustard as one reviewer suggested. For the candied pecans I used a recipe from AR; 'Sugar 'n' Spice Nuts'. The salad and dressing came together very well and will probably be a repeat in the future.

This is my new favorite salad!  The dressing is what makes it really unique.  I have served this numerous times at special occasions this past year and it has been a hit every time.  Often one of the first empty dishes at a potluck :)

This is a great recipe.   This makes a really nice presentation.   Except for using canned pears I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for this keeper.

I couldn't find walnut oil, so I used EVOO.  It turned out wonderful!!!  I also used strawberries instead of pears.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious!  I didn't have walnut oil, so I used olive oil, and it was very yummy!  I think the vinegar could be reduced to 1/4 cup or less though...the vinegar flavor might be a bit strong for some people.
