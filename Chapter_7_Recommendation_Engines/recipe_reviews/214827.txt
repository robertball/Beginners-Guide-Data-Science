Sounds great as is. I plan to make it this weekend. Just to cut a little fat I think I will brush the rolls with olive oil and grill them after I take the steak off. We love grilled bread and no need to heat or clean another pan.

Good recipe. I think it needs a touch of garlic so I lightly dusted the steaks with garlic powder, and used a touch of salsa instead of the cheese.

These were delicious.  I was skeptical about frying a roll with mayo on it and I nearly skipped that step but I am glad I didn't...the warm toasted creaminess = yum!  I have since toasted bread/mayo like this for other sandwiches too.  We'll have these again and again.

This was absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to add Chorizo but that was only because I had one in the fridge I had to use! Frying the bread was a simple addition but I think it really made the meal.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

After living in Texas for over 13 years I know Torta's and tacos well! These were amazing, my family devoured them! The second time I made them I changed the recipe a bit. Both ways were great. Thank you Sarah for an amazing recipe!

These turned out great! I used torta bread from Costco. I also added pico de gallo. Delicious and came close to the amazing Tortas in Mexico.
