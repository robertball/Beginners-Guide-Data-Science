I also skipped the cranberry juice. It had plenty of liquid. I added about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, a splash of triple sec and a handful of almonds. My husband said it's the best I've ever made. I can't wait to taste it at our friendsgiving dinner tomorrow night!

Skipped the cranberry juice.  Don't think it needs the extra liquid.  Yummy.
