Liked this salad, but there are a few things that I would do differently in the future.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings which called for 1 large shredded carrot...too much for us, would cut the carrot amount in half.  Personal taste preference, but I think dried cranberries would be a good option to the raisins, and they would give the salad a little pop of color.  Instead of mixing the raisins (or cranberries) and peanuts into the salad, I would plate the salad and then garnish with these two items, as they just fall to the bottom of the salad bowl.  You need to be a serious arugula lover to thoroughly enjoy this salad.  I wonder if a blend of spinach and arugula might be more palatable to many folks, as the arugula on its own is very peppery.  Nice dressing, and right amount, as it didnâ€™t drench the salad itself.  Also, I would add the zest to the dressing, not to the salad itself, as I think it will be better distributed in the salad.  This easily could be changed into a main course salad with the addition of some grilled shrimp or chicken.
