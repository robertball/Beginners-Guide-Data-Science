Pretty good!  Was going to make homemade pasta to serve with this, but ran out of time so put it with spaghetti.  I couldn't get this to thicken much, so I added more cheese and hoped it would work on pasta after boiling and noticing it was coating the spoon.  It did work; although it seemed thin, it worked well on the pasta and visitors (hubs' brother, sister in law, nieces, and s-i-l's grandmother) all enjoyed it.  I am not a fan of Alfredo, but this was a nice enough version for me.  I did add chicken to it; I sliced chicken strips, cooked in olive oil and garlic, put it in a separate bowl, and added back in to the sauce once the sauce was done.  very nice; thanks for the recipe!

I use a variation of this that I found on this site, and have for years and years. I use fat free cream cheese, and throw in a dollop of fat free sour cream, but I cut the butter to almost nil. Maybe two tablespoons. Fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and sometimes the parmesan. Depending on the kind you use the combination of garlic and parmesan can be overpowering. We use it for many things and everyone loves it! Our favorite is to make tortellini, fry and slice italian sausage, steam some spinach and artichoke hearts, top it all with the sauce.

It was rather bland, but since I had more sauce than pasta, I made more pasta and added garlic salt & oregano to the remaining sauce and it was very good. Next time I will forgo the garlic powder--use 2 tsp garlic salt instead of garlic powder and add 2 tsp of oregano and a little more pepper, too.

I have used this recipe for quite a while.  I use neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead of butter.  I also add 2 cloves of freshly minced garlic and a dash of salt.  The garlic and salt gives the sauce an extra boost of flavor.  We usually have this with smoked salmon and pasta-delicious!

My husband, who normally refuses to eat anything that's a "healthier" version, liked this.  I only added 3 Tblsp of butter because that's all I had.  And after reading other comments, I only used about 1 cup of milk (skim) and added a splash of sherry.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  I served with pasta and chicken, which I had sauteed with onions and garlic.  Yummy.

Very good and easy.  Made per directions but only had 2% milk and it took about 10 minutes to thicken up but it was a big hit with the hubby and kids!

EXCELLENT recipe!!! I was a bit hesitant to try it, because normally things that say "healthy" are not authentic, but I tried this recipe because I had what I needed for it on hand, and it is by far the best one I've found yet. I did make just a few changes, like I doubled the recipe and made it with half cream and half milk, I also added dried basil. As this was cooking, I noticed that the sauce wasn't thickening so I added a LOT more cheese and cooked it about ten minutes longer than the recipe calls for . It was delicious!

So simple and yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except added a little more garlic to my taste. Paired great with chicken and quinoa spaghetti noodles. Best homemade Alfredo sauce I have tried so far!

Several people mentioned that it was bland - I added a pinch of nutmeg and a little bit of lemon zest.  I also used neufchatel cheese because I couldn't find fat free cream cheese.  It ended up being a bit sweeter than I would have liked.

This worked great in a pinch. I had whipped cream cheese and reduced fat milk to use. I was even short about an oz of cream cheese and it worked fine. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about 3~4 servings. I used it as a sauce for store bought lobster and shrimp ravioli.

I made this for a quick pasta lunch. It's very easy to make! I prefer a thicker sauce, so I added a bit more cream cheese. I also added two generous spoonfuls of spaghetti tomato sauce for extra flavor, delicious!

What a great recipe! Because I was making a white pizza on a cauliflower crust, this was a great addition. I did add more garlic, white pepper instead of black, a 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream and I only used 1 cup of almond milk instead of skim. I also added a teaspoon of dried rosemary and a finely diced jalapeños. A big hit!

Not sure why this would be considered 'healthier' because with the cream cheese & butter, it is still pretty fattning.  Tasted good but alittle thicker than I would have liked.  Maybe chicken broth would thin it out a bit.
