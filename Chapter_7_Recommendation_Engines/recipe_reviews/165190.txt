I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated, and it came out so much better than I imagined it would!  I thought it would be cheap and cheerful, and useful as a side to something, but it is absolutely delicious!  The combination of spices is completely spot on, giving a very rich and authentic flavour, with a good amount of spicyness, but not enough to hurt! Of course it tastes better the next day, as any curry does.

The only things I would change in this recipe when I next make it (As I definitely shall), is that I will increase the amount of potatoes by at least 50%, to six or seven potatoes, and use only an 8oz can of chickpeas.  The curry as it is, is more like a chickpea curry with potatoes, but I'd like potatoes to be the main feature.  I think this curry would be very good too with spinach in it, instead of the peas, although its great as it is! 

ps. Im neither vegan nor vegetarian.

I am almost embarrassed to tell everyone what I did to this recipe because of the lack of all of the ingredients... but I had to share because it turned out so well!!  It all started with the potatoes I needed to use up... when I came across this yummy sounding recipe.  I had no onions in the house, but I did have dried chopped onion, so I rehydrated them... I had no fresh garlic in the house, so I used the minced stuff in the jar (never as good as fresh, imho)... I had no fresh ginger, so I used ginger paste... I had no canned diced toms, but I did have tom paste... I had no coconut milk, but did have coconut milk powder to reconstitute...  I was infinitely surprised to have a can of peas, since I really don't care for canned peas at all (where did THOSE come from??).  In spite of all of my creative yet irreverent adjustments, this is one of the best curries I have ever tasted!

This was very flavorful and had a great texture. I omitted the chickpeas and added cauliflower, which I steamed over the boiling potatoes. I agree with other reviewers that this could have used more potatoes; it's pretty saucy. I wasn't in the mood for super spicy, so I used 1 tsp cayenne. I also reduced the curry to 1 tbsp, which was just right for us. Excellent over brown rice!

This is a great base for curry. I usually add a ton more veggies(frozen peas, beans, edaname, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, etc...) and I usually reduce the amount of garam masala spice to 2 tsp., but that's just my taste preference. But an overall great recipe- I make it a lot!

Holy yum! I'm not sure about other people calling this bland. I would say to check your spices. If they sit too long (in your cupboard or on the shelf) they wont be flavorful. Especially the cayanne. If its fresh, 1 1/2 teaspoons is really hot! Fair warning. Also, I'm not big on potatoes, now those are bland, so I used sweet potatoes and they are delicious. I also mixed up the veggies according to what I had on hand and added tofu. Wonderful!

This recipe is not bad, but the amounts of spices is off.  It's a bit overboard to have 4 t. of curry, 4 t. of garam masala, and 2 t. of cumin.  These spices are strong enough that I would cut these quantaties down to 1 t. cumin, 1-2 t. curry, and 1 t. garam masala.  The flavor will be there but prevent it from tasting too heavy which is what happens when you go overboard on those spices.  It will actually taste more flavorful with less (quantanty-wise) spices.  Also, you won't need as much salt (2t. is not healthy!) if you don't make the dish taste so heavy by going overboard with the spices.  More is not better in this case!  I speak from the experience of being both a lover of curries and an experienced cook in making curries.

Great Recipe!  I wrote a lengthy review detailing the outcome but this lack-luster website just erased it.  The recipe is really good.  Use large potatos.

I love this curry! I've made it twice now. It's good right away, but the next day the flavors are excellent. I altered it by using light coconut milk and going a little light on the cayenne and salt. I think as a result of using the light coconut milk, it needed a couple of teaspoons of sugar. The second time I made it, I added a diced green pepper and threw in a diced carrot with the potatoes for the last half of cooking. Easy, delicious and full of veggies -- for a lot less than at a restaurant.

Definitely abundant spices! The ginger and coconut tastes were basically lost in the dish though.  I omitted the tomatoes because I'm not a huge fan.  Didn't care for the balance of potato vs garbanzos.  I would use more potato and less garbanzos, and I think yellow sweet potato would have a great flavor with the spices instead of regular taters.

This was pretty good.  Similar to many of the curry recipes we already make.  My husband liked this was because he thought it was saucier than some of our other recipes.  My 6-year old liked the combo of peas and potatoes.  I thought it was pretty good, but as ridiculous as this sounds, I thought the spice combination was a bit bland.  The spice (hotness) was good for purctastes, but the others didn't really stand out.  We will probably make this again, but not very often.

Oh my gosh, this was sooooo good.  I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was perfect.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, yukon gold potatoes with the skin on, and frozen vegetables instead of canned peas.  Another reviewer commented on the lack of lots of vegetables so I went for it.  However, I believe this dish would be just as amazing without them, just not as good for ya.  We ate this with Naan by Mic (also from this website) and I HIGHLY recommend you eat these together, as it was heaven.  Everything was eaten with indian basmati rice.  Be adventurous and eat this tonight.

The unusual combination of flavours works well.  I reduced the garam masala to 1 teaspoon, because I found it overpowering and I used a heaped tablespoon of good quality curry paste.  Frozen peas (added at the end) tastes better than tinned.  I added some diced, cooked chicken for my husband and he rated it 5 stars!

This curry is a great base, but I felt that it needed more flavor.  I did leave out the cayenne since my husband cant handle spice very well.  Next time I will try adding more of the spices in as I make it.  The only main suggestion I have is you might want to cut up the diced tomatoes into smaller pieces; I found the size a little too big and overpowering for the bites with the tomato.  Overall, great curry recipe! We will definately make this again with a little more spices.

Super good! My husband said, "make sure you save this recipe!" Other reviews said this was spicy, but does not bite.... Maybe my spices are more potent than others because this really knocked our socks off. This made a lot of extra sauce, next time I will add more veggies, cauliflower especially. I prepared this meal and hour before dinner time so the spices had a chance to meld. I added edamame and peas just before serving. Thanks, MegKat, this is a keeper!

Very flavorful, but oh-too-spicy-hot for my delicate palate with 1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper; the curry and garam masala also added "pepperyness" to it as well.  However, my husband LOVES curry and LOVES spice and he asked to not change a thing!  So, we compromised; next time I make it (and there will be a next time) - leave out the cayenne and he will add it to his own portions.  Delicious as a meal on its own and perfect for leftovers.  Your home will smell SO fragrant after making this!  Do not be afraid to use the whole (large) onion (for sure if it's a sweet yellow, like Vidalia), and add more garlic.  The flavors intertwine and blend so nicely that it's actually pretty much fool-proof.  When the weather is warm, serve with a crisp salad or a bowl of mixed fruit.  When it's the cooler months, serve with a basket full of flan or crusty bread and a big bowl of those winter veggies that seem to always go overlooked.  So, if you love spice, it's perfect just the way it is.  If you're like me an enjoy flavorful over spice, then you might want to conservatively add the cayenne, curry, and garam.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't so spicy for my palate.  My husband is mad - he wanted 5 but I'm writing this! ;)

Really, really yummy. Next time I'll cut down on the cayenne pepper but this is a winner for the amount of food with a unique flavor and minimal work.

This is a staple for me; I usually add cumin seed, carrots, and fresh green beans.  PRO TIP: add the curry powder and cumin seed when you're cooking the onion to open the flavors of these spices, then add the garlic with the remaining spices.

Usually I make a recipe first, then follow others suggestions the next time I make. But this time I read reviews, added some sweet potatoes, spinach, cauliflower, cut the spices in half, then tasted as I went along and ended up added the amount in the recipe. Loved this dish.

I can definitely understand where the people who say this is "bland" are coming from. Its spicy, but lacks any depth. It needs herbs or something in it. Probably a good starter recipe like someone else mentioned.

Surprisingly delicious!  We made a few changes: We upped the potatoes to 6, and cut back the spices to  3 tsps of Garam Masala i/o 4 and 1 tsp of cayenne i/o 1.5 (thank you fellow cooks; I love heat but the 1 tsp of cayenne was plenty spicy!) We swapped frozen peas for canned (hate canned vegetables!). 

It's a bit boring to look at, so next time I will cut back the chick peas to 1/2 can, cut the 6 potatoes down to 3 and add some carrots and broccoli for more color and variation and will garnish with some fresh, chopped cilantro.  Still, folks, it's a winner as written (if you cut back on the cayenne!)

UPDATE: Made this again Friday night and used the same spice measurements as above, but used 3 boiled and cubed potatoes, 1/2 can chick peas and we cheated: we added half a bag of microwaved steamed peas, and a full bag of a microwaved steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrot mix). Served with hot, buttered naan bread, 5 of us devoured it!  Also, we used a frozen piece of ginger and I must say that it grated a lot easier with the microplane than fresh ginger and is much tastier than using powdered ginger any day.

Yes! It was tasty. Thank you for a recipe I will use again and again.

Adjustments (out of necessity): Used all the cayenne, 6-8 bird chilies, 2 serranos (with the seeds) - it was hot enough for me, although I doubt anyone who wasn't really used to "hot" would be able to eat it. I actually broke out in a forehead sweat, but that's the way I like it. LOL

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and had to use a mix of Thai red & green curry pastes (because I didn't have any Indian curry powder) but I will not be without it the next time.

I didn't have any garbanzos or peas. So, used potatoes, Kabocha squash, carrots and brussel sprouts. I sauteed green pepper and 2 c fresh tomatoes and a few Keffir lime leaves with the onion and spices. I cut the coconut milk in half and used about a cup of the vegetable stock. The squash thickened it up sufficiently. Makes me think that any combination of vegetables would work as long as you have the textures. The combo of spices was perfect. BTW Kabocha squash is probably the best squash I've ever had in my life.

I had it with basmati rice and a cold beer. It was so filling that I couldn't eat very much (but maybe that was partially because it was so fiery), but that's good, more for tomorrow.

As far as curry recipes go, this was a lot of spice and really no flavor.  Added a bunch of other vegetables and additional coconut milk to try to bring out the spices.  Recommend adding pureed or leaf spinach, crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  Possibly try yogurt instead of the coconut milk.

Very good! I only used 3 potatoes and no onions. I served with plain yogurt, to tame the spice. I added an extra garlic clove as well.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out great!  My roommate and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only thing I changed was I used more potatoes (almost 1.75 lbs of red potatoes) upon another reviewer's suggestion and I'm glad I did.  Next time, I may cut the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp because was a little spicy for me.  I make my final decision when I have the left overs tonight.

Holy smokers! I loved it. I used frozen peas instead of canned> And wow I think it definitely serves over 6 i brought some to my sister at work and also some to my dad who is a big curry fan and he even had some right away the next day. Only thing was I couldn't find garam masala  (and didn't want to make the spice blend) so i used curry row and nixed the cumin since there's some in the row blend. yum yum. Having some for lunch tomorrow. Thank you for sharing.

This was amazing! I did add more potatoes and lessened cayenne to only 1/2 a tsp and added a diced jalapeno - so it probably equals the same spice level. It was sooooo good and filling. But beware people, you must love spicy food to love this. Also, if you are not vegan, you can add some sour cream on top to cool off the heat. My entire family loved it! It was very filling and is definitely a main dish that does not need a side. Thanks!!!

This is a really outstanding recipe.  The texture is great, it's nice and filling, easy to make, inexpensive, and the big spicy flavor mix just knocks my socks off!  The only thing I changed in the recipe was I used frozen peas instead of canned.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM!!!  My 13 yr old came home from a visit to England with a penchant for curry.  He found this recipe and wanted me to try it.  It was a HIT!  I increased the potatoes and decreased the chickpeas, since he is a potato lover, and left everything else the same.  This will be a regular in our dinner rotation.

Holy awesomeness. This was my first tackle ever at making Indian cuisine, and this recipe rocked. I followed it exactly, except I left out onions because I hate onions! It turned out amazing! This recipe made SO much food - we'll be having it for lunch and dinner for the next two days - no complaints here!

This recipe is excellent! I actually used all the cayenne it called for AND added 1/2tsp of some dried habanero because I can never have enough spice. (not to mention adding sriracha chili sauce to my serving) Great flavors overall!  We were out of rice, so I served it with couscous, which worked really nice with it!  Definatly making this again!

This was wonderful.  I used six potatoes because mine were on the smaller size.  I did cut back on the cayenne, down to 1/2 tsp and it was still a little hot, but not terribly.  We will be having this again.  Also, I thought it made more than 6 servings.  We had leftovers after six adults eating.

This was a good curry, except for the cayenne pepper.  1 1/2 teaspoons is way to much.  I like spicy, but this made it so you couldn't even eat it.  Maybe it was the kind that I bought all organic, and I only put in 1 tsp.  I am probably going to have to throw it out because of how spicy it is.  If I make it agin I will leave this out.  Otherwise it was good.

I really enjoyed this dish! I followed the directions  with the following exceptions:  i didn't measure the salt/spike or cayenne i used; i used red potatoes (6 cups diced/about 15 small ones), small red onion, light coconut milk, 3 tbsp olive oil, and crushed tomatoes.  It produced 11 servings, each one with 257 calories, 6 grams fat, 8 grams protein, and 5 grams fiber.  thanks!

This is my first time reviewing anything on allrecipes, because this was THAT good. I used 6 potatoes, frozen peas and subbed ginger in a jar for the ginger root and it tasted perfect! I don't understand the reviews that say it's bland or not enough spice etc. because the ratio of spices in this recipe is wonderful! I honestly feel as though this might be better than some of the Indian restaurants I frequent. I usually enjoy eating my own food but the flavor and textures of this meal really blew me away and it was SO simple! Served it over brown rice and it was delicious and very filling and lots of leftovers! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves Indian food as this tastes so authentic!

I think the spices listed are about right for a traditional curry, however it seems to be missing something.  Ours had plenty of spice but lacked flavor.  We added a dash of fish sauce and some sugar and let it simmer more.  I'll have it for lunch today and see if the extra time helped.

This was a hit with my picky partner (and myself!).  She doesn't like spicy food so I cut the cayenne down to 1/2 teaspoon and she said it was just right.  Other modifications I made:  didn't peel the potatoes, and only boiled them for 5 minutes, so they stayed more firm; used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and cut the curry and garam masala in half.  Tasted fantastic, and the kitchen smelled delicious for the next two days!

If you want to save some time use Pataks mild curry paste like I did.  I luv curry so I use 1/2 a jar.  Reduce the oil for frying the onions if you want to cut calories.

My version isn't vegan, but was delicious all the same.  I used about 7 small to medium potatoes, could only find a 19 oz can of chickpeas, and used a 28 oz can of tomatoes, more out of "oops, I meant to use half the can.... oh well" than anything else.

Rather than saute the onions and garlic for five minutes and then throw in the spices, the spices went straight in with the oil to get nice and fragrant.  It worked, my husband appeared from nowhere and asked how he could help, because it smelled awesome.  I match-sticked the fresh ginger rather than mincing it, and cubed two chicken breasts, which went into the pan to stir fry with the spices before adding the chickpeas and the rest.  

Oh, and I omitted the peas, at my husband's request.  Next time I'll throw a handful of frozen peas in.

One last note.  Even with the additional chicken, the extra potatoes, there isn't much left in the way of leftovers.  That doesn't speak to the quantity, but the quality.  And my husband's hollow leg! ;)

This recipe is GREAT.  My husband is from India, and he LOVED it.  He said it tasted very authentic, which says a lot coming from him!  He compared it to an Indian dish called "sabji" and said it was very similar.  I added some frozen okra, used ginger-garlic paste in place of the ginger root, and used lots of crushed red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne (we didn't have any).  It was a huge hit.  It was the perfect balance of spices for my husband, but I was still able to eat it (being an American sometimes I can't handle as much spice as he can).  We both thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you don't like yours super-spicy, I'd suggest cutting back on the cayenne.  It will still have flavor without being overly "hot."  We will definitely make this one again!

The flavor would be really great if it wasn't so spicy.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I added a couple more potatoes, and it is so spicy I can barely eat it - and I like spicy stuff!!  I'm letting it sit overnight and hopefully it will be not quite as fiery!

This was very, very good. Thank you so much!  I took a shortcut and used 2 cans of small potatoes (diced). They saved time and effort and worked very well.  I used about 2/3 can of coconut milk.  I've grown accustomed to cutting coconut because my daughter doesn't like the taste to be overpowering.  A keeper.

I followed the recipe but added more potatoes and it was too spicy, and I like spicy food. The flavors are good, but next time I will omit the cayenne pepper, use less garam masala, and use large peas instead of petite. The sauce can easily be used as a base for other recipes. I'll try it with other veggies and put it over rice.

Probably the most delicious recipe I've tried so far, I loved the taste although the cayenne pepper burned my taste buds!! Didn't care and kept on eating lol. The coconut milk really gave it that special taste to the food, I'm thinking of next time I make this dish I'm definitely going easy on the pepper lol... Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!!! Oh and I also posted a picture of my finished dish so everyone can see it. :)

This was super delicious.  I used sweet potatoes, a little less than 1 teaspoon of cayenne (it was still pretty darn spicy) and frozen peas. I let mine simmer longer and served it with jasmine rice. I loved it! Will definitely make again.

I had to change it somewhat to accommodate for the fact that I had no garam masala on hand  (though, I make my own version of it, which is delicious.); I also added cous cous and more coconut milk to make up for that. 

I will definitely cut down on the cayenne when I make this again (And I will make this again! Yum.) as it was much too spicy. I love spicy, but the cayenne here really overpowered the rest of the spices, I thought. My boyfriend liked it a lot though. :)  It will probably taste even better tomorrow. Thanks for posting!

I love the heat (spice) level on this, but i'd caution the unaware.  It was way to spicey for my wife

This is a true 5-star recipe. The only change I made was to substitute a bit of extra potato instead of the chickpeas, which are hard to find here in Korea. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and wound up with a delightfully spicy, flavorful curry with the perfect balance of ingredients. Made it twice so far and expect it will become a mainstay here on out. A real feather in the cap of any vegan chef. Thanks so much!

What a great vegetarian/vegan recipe! My husband said he could be vegan if everything I cooked tasted like this. I did omit the cayenne pepper as I am sensitive to hot spicy. It was a wonderful blend of spices! My 19 month old and 3 year old ate it up! I added some cauliflower to add some more veggies and 3 fresh tomatoes and it came out great! I agree with adding some more potatoes but that is just preference. Thanks for such a great tasty recipe!

Delish! Be sure to use a VERY large skillet though because mine couldn't hold everything so I had to transfer half into the potato pot to simmer at the end. I also used less oil than indicated and it turned out fine as long as you keep an eye on the onions. Thanks for the quick, cheap,  recipe!

This is scrumptious!  I omitted the cayenne completely, since I wanted my kids to be able to eat it.  It was PLENTY spicy without the cayenne.  I used 6 potatoes and frozen peas instead of canned.  So, so good.  Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

Quite spicy!!  We don't add the cayenne as my husband enjoys burn your face off spicy, while I just enjoy pretty spicy food.  After the food is served up, we prefer just to add sriracha so each person can doctor up their own.

This tasted great, although I did make a few changes. First off, this made so much that I would freeze at least half of it next time. I added an extra potato, used more oil, and lessened the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. I also would lessen the amount of garam masala to 3 tsp as well next time. I used the recipe for easy garam masala on this website. I used about half a tsp of dried ginger instead of fresh, and next time I will try using cauliflower instead of the can of tomatoes. I also used frozen peas instead of canned. Next time I will only boil the chopped potatoes in the water for 12 minutes because some of it ended up as mushed potatoes in the curry. But this really tasted like authentic Indian cuisine in my opinion! Good and healthy.

Spicy but good!  One of my four potatoes was a sweet potato.  Used a little less cayenne pepper than called for, and I think I only used 1 tsp. of salt.  Also used frozen peas instead of canned.  Served it over a bed of Jasmine rice.  It made a LOT, I'd say feed probably more like 8 people!

Very yummy, quite spicy, but we like that.  I will say that I did add some tumeric to the finish because the color is pretty unappealing otherwise.

Very bland and too spicy.  I followed the recipe with no exceptions.  All my wife and I could taste was the cayenne pepper heat. We both enjoy Indian cuisine and spicy food, however we both felt it was too hot and quite tasteless.

This is really, really good.  The amount of spices seem to be just right, except that I only used 1 t. of salt, and we are salt-lovers.

My daughters absolutely love this dish, and so do I. I have been making the curry for a few years and tweaked the recipe somewhat. About half the amount of spices gives it enough heat, half the amount of coconut milk (freezes so well!) is adequate and fresh deseeded and chopped tomatoes makes it less runny and much tastier. I usually add a chopped avocado just before serving and if I have some, a handful of fresh spinach. Looks good - tastes good and will always be a staple in my household.

I love this curry! I added 1/4 cup chopped cashews that I fry with onion. I also added about 1 and 1/c cup cauliflower, and 2 sweet potatoes cubed.  I decrease the cayenne to 1/4 t. I serve it over quinoa cooked in vegetable broth.

Delicious!!! I have never before reviewed a recipe but HAD to review this one! Perfect blend of spices and flavors and very easy to prepare! I was afraid it would be too hot with 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne, but it wasn't...at least not for us. My husband loved it and said I definitely need to save this recipe and make it again. Over an hour after dinner and we're still talking about it! Creamy, spicy, rich, and perfect with brown rice. The only alteration I made was using 2 large potatoes plus 2 cups of cauliflower rather than 4 potatoes. Give this one a try. You won't be sorry!

Very good; a little too spicy for me (next time I make it I will decrease the spiciness) but not hot enough for my husband (who, I swear, cannot feel any type of heat).

So easy to make and delicious. I doubled the amount of potatoes and tomatoes, added cauliflower, kumara and carrots because I didn't have any peas in the house! I can't stop myself sneaking tastings before it's being served at the table with basmati.

Made this recipe for a group of four, and everyone loved it. I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp instead of 1 1/2tsp) and curry powder to make it less spicy, but it still turned out flavourful and very satisfying. Even the meateaters in the group liked it!

I have been looking for a recipe to replace the Japanese curry paste I buy at the grocery store.  This is the one!  This will be my go to recipe whenever I am in the mood for spicy curry.  I did reduce the cayenne in half for my daughter, but it was still too spicy for her, although my husband and I loved it.  Thanks so much for posting.

This was so spicy that it was inedible! My husband and I could hardly get one serving down (and we like spicy food). The curry flavor is good, but put WAY less cayenne pepper in than called for.

Just made this tonight!! YUMMY!!! I tasted it before I added the coconut milk and decided that I really liked it without even adding that.  Next time maybe I will add it is great without it too!!  I adjusted the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp and since I didn't have any peas, I added some organic spinach.  I will be making this again.

I only used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and this was still too spicy. I cannot understand how the original measurements are 1 1/2 teaspoons. By the way I DO enjoy spicy food on a regular basis.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  What to do something interesting?  Take a very green banana, slice it thin with skin on and pan fry it until caramelized.  Add it before simmering.  Delicious!

This was delicious, not at all bland, and quite foolproof! I currently live in China, where cooking and finding certain ingredients can be a challenging adventure. Because of this, I didn't have any cumin or garam masala, so I had to omit them. I was really worried it would compromise the dish, but it was still delicious.

I estimated the amounts of curry powder and cayenne that I added, used a bit more fresh ginger and garlic, and added about 1-2 tsp of white sugar and a pinch of cinnamon at the end. I think that the sugar really brought together the flavor, but I also think a combo of regular and sweet potatoes could have the same effect without taking away from the healthy quality of this meal. I served it over a small amount of brown rice, but would also be happy eating it on its own sometimes (and I liked the ratio of chickpeas to potatoes and the sauciness of the curry). 

With regards to people thinking it was too spicy or too bland, I think it comes down to certain brands and qualities of spices being more potent than others and people's taste buds being different, so I really think that people should just start out with less than the recommended amounts, and add gradually to taste. My family loves spicy food, so I put in approximately what was called for with the cayenne. 

Neither my husband or I are vegan, but we both really enjoyed it, and I'll continue to make it after I move back to Canada!

It was edible, but I'm not going to make it again. Like other reviewers said, it lacked flavour (despite being full of spice) and I was disappointed because it sounded so good.

This was not the least bit good. I followed the recipe exactly as and it came out horrible. I do not recommend this to anyone.

Definitely a restaurant worthy recipe!  This was my first attempt at making curry and it was fabulous!  Try using red skin potatoes (you'll want to use 5 or 6 since they tend to be smaller), their flavor is really excellent in combination with the spices!

This a very easy and delicious dish.  I omitted the cayenne as my kids don't like hot but this is great!  I love how easy this was to put together.  Great starter for those who are trying Indian food in their homes.

Made it as the recipe is written.  So incredibly good.  Kind of hot for the wimps in the family, but it is ROCK STAR awesome.  Going in the keeper file and on the top.

I really enjoyed this!  I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp only because of personal preference. I also used some cauliflower (didn't have enough potatoes).  It turned out great!  I shared it with my sister and she has already requested the recipe.  Thanks for posting!

This is delicious!  Very authentic, very spicy, very easy to make...we served with basmati rice, roti, and cottage cheese to help cut through the spice which was very refreshing!  My Indian friends were quite impressed with this white girl's curry :) Will definitely be making again.

Hot ! This curry was soooooo good. Its really spicy and that's exactly how I like it. The only difference I made was to use light coconut milk, but I left everything else the same. My boyfriend also really enjoyed this and there was plenty for leftovers.

Followed recipe pretty much exactly, except adding more potatoes like other reviewers mentioned, so I have plenty of leftovers.  I think the sauce would be really thin if I only used the 4 potatoes.  I only used 1 tsp of the cayenne in case it would be too spicy and I'm glad I did!  It definitely had a kick!  Adding cauliflower would be nice too, will try that next time.  Hubby and I gobbled it up with some flatbread to catch all the sauce.

I followed this recipe to a T, except that I cut the cayenne back to about 1 tsp.  Let me just say that this was inedible!  It was so over seasoned and spicy that I spent half an hour trying to fix it.  You couldn't taste anything but spices and heat from the cayenne.

I made this recipe exactly how it's written. I agree with another review that said the taste of the coconut milk and ginger is totally overpowered. If I make this again, I'd cut the curry powder in half.

Overall it has a nice texture and flavor and goes well served over brown rice with a glass of crisp white wine to cut the spiceiness.

I looked at the amount of spice this recipe calls for and wondered if I should scale it down a little, but decided to follow it as written.  The spices completely overwhelm the flavors of the veggies and coconut milk!  We served the curry over rice, and my husband says it's like "spicy rice with a weird texture" -- we know the veggies are in there, but the dish is definitely over-seasoned.  Next time I make this, I'll use half the curry powder and garam masala!

My dad loved this! That's saying a lot because he told me weeks earlier that he did not care for curry :) He even asked to bring some home with him. He told me later that the leftovers were just as good as the first time! Oh, and I loved it as well!

I have made this a few times and love it.  I think it is just the right combination of spices.  It does make a lot but it freezes very well.

This was pretty easy to make and definitely delicious. If I were to make it again, I might tone down the spices a little bit. I do like spicy food but this was almost overpowering. Perhaps reduce a little bit, then add in depending on the flavor. Definitely best with Indian bread.

When followed exactly, this is way too spicy.  The spices completely overpower the veggies and coconut milk.  I couldn't taste anything but spice!  If I made this again I would cut the spices in half, at least.  

I would recommend that you start out with less spices the first time you make it to see if you like it, rather than waste a big pot of food like I did.

I made this one evening and took most of it to share at work the next day, mainly because there was no way I could eat it all. Every week afterwards one of my coworkers would ask when I was going to make it again, he liked it so much. For the recipe I left out the garam masala and used black beans instead of chickpeas. I used 4 cans of new potatoes quartered. I couldn't find curry powder so I used a curry paste, and light coconut milk. It was pretty spicy but the flavors were SO very good. The second time I made it without following the recipe to the tee, and after tasting it I decided to put in about a tablespoon of dijon mustard to complete the layers of flavor. Try it! I eat this over brown rice or bulgur wheat with some ranch dressing (weird, I know) and it is heaven.

OMG so good! I just couldn't stop licking the spoon. The only thing is that... I really LOVE spicy things... and I usually like my dishes several times more spicy than the average bear. But I don't see how one could add as much cayenne pepper as this recipe calls for... unless you have cayenne pepper that is kind of old or dried out. I added only 1/2t of cayenne pepper, and it was plenty spicy. But take into consideration that I go through cayenne pretty fast so it was quite fresh. Just add small incriments at a time until it reaches your spicy requirement. I also used 1/2 the salt, (1 teaspoon) and added just a bit of sugar- about 1/4 t. just to bring out the coconut milk flavor. I also had only 3 potatoes, but plenty of chickpeas, so I used the potatoes I had and 2 cans instead of 1 can of chickpeas. So, to recap, add cayenne slowly to taste, half the salt, 1/4 t. of sugar, and more chickpeas/less potato. I will be licking my plate.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I love spicy food, but the amount of cayenne pepper was a bit much for me - I think I'll try 3/4 tsp next time. I used lite coconut milk and stirred in 2 - 3 tbl ghee at the end. The ghee helps to tame the spices a bit and gives it a richness that nothing else can. Will make this one again and again.

omg!  Coming from a Jamaican, this was very very flavorful... possibly also because I used Jamaican style curry which has a lot of umph...  I used fresh tomatoes.  It was however very spicy (didn't mind) but was very surprised.  The measurement of cayenne I didn't think it would be that hot...possibly the combination.  But very delish..am cooking for friends and may add Indian Roti.

This is amazing!  I love this curry.  I couldn't believe this came from my kitchen.  I've made it several times now, and I have made some minor, minor changes:  I sometimes add more spices, because I like my curry intense, I add black mustard seed for the texture, I use frozen peas because they are much, much better.  And the big one is that I use sweet potatoes.  They make this recipe SHINE! I love it, thank you so much!

This needed a little tweaking, but then it was really quite good. I used sweet potatoes, but kept everything else pretty close to the recipe at first. When I tasted it, it was nearly inedible because it was so hot (I'm used to very spicy food, so this was a surprise). I added a large can of crushed tomatoes, and that helped. It tasted very authentic. I will be making this again, but next time I will half the spices.

easy recipe, loved it.  I used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and it was still pretty spicy, so consider adjusting to your preference.  I served with brown rice.  Thanks for a great recipe, definitely a keeper.

I would give this 5 starts with modifications: -reduce cayenne to 1/2t. (I used medium yellow curry which also added heat) 
-omit salt, or at least wait and season to your taste!! 2 tsp. is WAY too much!
-use frozen peas (they seem to be more firm) 
-garnish with chopped cilantro 
I've also used sweet potatoes and cauliflower, and used 1 1/2 cans light coconut milk.
Very good!!!

This was fantastic!!  I agree that the spices are spot on.  I did use light coconut milk and then throw in about a TBSP of sugar.  I left the peels on the potatoes and they were delicious.  It was at its best a handful of days later - the flavors really came out more.  This was one of the best curry dishes I've made in awhile.  Thank you!

Excellent flavor, very easy. Only made minor changes - used 1 tsp. cumin seed instead of powdered, added 1/2 tsp ground coriander ('cuz I like it!), frozen instead of canned peas, and used half the amount of garam masala and added it at the very end of the cooking time instead of earlier as instructed in order to preserve the fresh quality of the spices. I don't like to cook garam masala too long because I think it diminishes its aromatic flavors. Thanks, I'll be adding this to my growing repertoire of Indian recipes.

This was the first potato curry I made, and I was impressed with the results. the only change I made was to exclude the cayenne, but the curry was amazing! I loved how the recipe used coconut milk, and the flavor was just one of my favorites. It sure does something with potatoes, and I will be sure to use this recipe again :)

This is one of the best recipes I've ever found on this site. I became a vegan a couple of months ago and I'm still learning how to eat. I made this dish and served it with Mexican red rice. It was delicious! I reduced the salt by half, and used frozen, rather than canned peas. It was perfect!

2nd time. YUMMY! So delicious and spicy. A few small changes: 1) Used 12 or so multicolored, new potatoes, unpeeled 2) reduced cayenne to 1 tsp 3) used frozen peas, about 1cup. Otherwise followed

This came out great. I added a bit more garlic (because who doesn't do that, right?), but otherwise I made this directly to recipe specs. I blended my own garam masaIa. I used 14 ounces of Silk coconut milk instead of canned, but I use canned often and felt like it was comparable. I served it alongside some fluffy basmati rice and some toasted naan bread, and the meat-loving men to whom I served it LOVED it. They went back for seconds - THEN I told them it was vegan! Thank you for an awesome, healthy recipe!

I made this with sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes,  and frozen peas instead of canned, both of which worked really well. I also went a bit easy on the cayenne because I am a wimp.  It was very good!

This is a very good curry.  A bit on the spicy side for me, but really good with rice.  This is a keeper especially during Bermuda's damp winters.

This was delicious. As advised in the comments, I increased the amount of potatoes in the recipe by about a half and it worked out perfectly. Warning: following the spices as listed in the original recipe will result in VERY spicy curry! I loved it though, and it was perfect on top of brown rice.

This was wonderfully spicy and flavorful.  I made saffron rice to go with it which was great.  It was a little runny so I added some cornstarch  mixed in water to thicken it while it simmered. I think that's because I used frozen peas which added moisture.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Great healthy dish, and this recipe is perfect if you're paleo (but don't want to eat so much meat all the time) or if you're doing the anti-inflammation diet.

I have made this recipe several times, including yesterday for my mother on Mother's Day. I find it way too spicy as written so cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 teaspoon and the remainder of the spices in half. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper. Looking forward to eating the leftovers.

Absolutely delicious, very filling and a nice alternative to meat. Would recommend adding raisins, really complement the spices. For an extra kick, I added a fresh Thai chili. Perfect served with a dollop of plain yogurt!

Holy spice! I only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I used cauliflower instead of potato. I added my spices first  before I added the onions. Overall a good, hearty meal. I topped mine with cilantro and some greek yogurt. Served it with basmati rice.

This curry was delicious!! I was surprised how such simple ingredients could taste so good. So quick to make too. Next time, I'll cook my own chickpeas but the canned ones where just fine. I used only 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and only had dried ground ginger instead of fresh. It was perfectly lightly spicy. I also added fresh coriander at the end.

I like spice in foods, but not a lot of heat. This definitely made me sweat when I ate it, however, it was one of the best curries I have ever had, and so simple to make. I'm currently making it now, where i'm going to cut the cayenne, garam masala, and curry down; i'll let you know how it is

Note: I have made the curry by cutting every spice in half except the garam masala. It managed to keep a good flavor without the heat.

We enjoyed this. We are vegan and gluten intolerant. I had nearly everything on hand; I used fresh tomatoes, and added spinach and some leftover canned corn. I was afraid it would be too salty so I only used a tsp. (that was a good call!) Very restaurant-like.

I made this recipe as stated except some minor changes. I used 1 1/2 tsp of ginger powder since I had no fresh ginger, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and added more potatoes as per other reviews. AMAZING!! Officially up there on my list of favourite vegan dishes. When making for guests I would cut the cayenne pepper in half, but I personally am a fan of how spicy and authentic this dish tastes.

Very good for an easy curry. I did cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and it was plenty spicy. We normally can tolerate fairly spicy foods...I think 1.5 tsp of cayenne might be inedible.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. 

I enjoy spicy food, and I was ok with the heat level. Unfortunately the rest of my family couldn't eat this. It was just way too spicy. 

I think it would have been better cutting all the dry spices in half. Because even though I could stand the heat, it still just tased over seasoned.

Couldn't get my hands on garam masala, so I used some green curry paste instead. I also left out the peas. This recipe exceeded my expectations!! It was very abundant in flavor and just the right amount of spice. This is now my go to curry recipe :) Next time I will try adding some carrots just to make it a bit more nutritious.

This is the recipe I've been waiting for!! The spice amounts are just right and make this dish just like from a restaurant, although I didn't add any cayenne since I didn't want it to be spicy. I used only about half the potatoes, and added a sweet potato, three small carrots, and about a cup of halved Brussels sprouts since I had them in the fridge. This recipe can accommodate lots of different kinds of veggies, and would be wonderful with some paneer (although it wouldn't be vegan then).

This was really good. I couldn't find garam masala so I excluded it. I added some red curry paste and also added tofu and substituted edamame for the peas. Served with white rice and naan. Recipes makes a lot!

This was really yummy and easy to make for a Sunday lunch. I cut back on the spices, as my husband is not a spicy fan...But I should have gone full-bore with this! Next time I make it I will use all the spice called for...I used left-over baked potatoes so I skipped that step. I think I could add some other vegies next time, and serve it with rice. I minced up some leftover cilantro to garnish the top...Very good recipe.  My friend made this recipe also, and he used squash cubes instead of the potatoes...He loved that variation too.

Really good hearty filling and plentiful. ....and spicy. Used 1 tsp. Cayenne & no Masala still very spicy. Cooked with coconut oil & sweet potatoes instead, poured over wild & brown rice. Really yummy but will do less cayenne next time. Definitely a new go to meal.

this was pretty good, not the best I've had but still pretty decent. it was a bit too salty for me but I fixed it by adding a spoonful of peanut butter (made it thicker and gave it more texture). I added carrots, bell pepper, kale, and mushrooms and it made all the difference! being a vegetarian for quite sometime now I enjoy the different flavors of the veggies and it adds an attractive pop of colour if you're serving it to guests!

This is a creamy recipe that is busy with flavors. There were two adjustments I made from the original recipe to suite my preferences. Even though this recipe is a warm one, I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half. That way the brain can focus on all the other flavors from the various other spices. I adjusted the cooking time from the posted recipe to prevent over cooking the potatoes (shortened the length.)

poor recipe since one and one-half teaspoons of cayenne pepper is way too much.  I made it as described without any changes.

I just finished eating this and it was lovely! Rich and with great flavours. Next time I will cut down on the cayenne pepper though; I had already cut it down to one teaspoon and even that was too spicy for me. I added more potatoes, omitted the ginger (I didn't have any), and used frozen peas but otherwise made it exactly as stated. I will definitely be making this again. Next time I might try serving it over rice.

I thought this was a really good recipe! After reading some of the reviews which said that it was kind of "saucy" I added more potatoes. I was craving a curry dish and this very easy one hit the spot! It is definitely even better the next day. It can get spicy, so for those of you who don't like it spicy, you may want to back off on the cayenne. For my husband and I, we add lots of spice. Substituting serrano chili peppers for the cayenne as you saute the onions may work very well...you would still get the spice, but it kicks in earlier and doesn't linger, like cayenne does. 
I found it to be very filling and satisfying. My husband is a cowboy and wants meat at every meal, so I sauteed some chicken thighs on the side for him and he was happy. He also doesn't like garbanzo beans, but he said he didn't even notice them!

Just finished making this.  The only change I made was to use frozen peas.  It was fantastic!!!  I've already shared it with a friend.  Can't wait to eat my leftovers for lunch tomorrow...I'm sure it will be even better!

I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. The only adjustments I've made are to add more veggies (broccoli, carrots, sometimes squash), use a fresh diced tomato instead of the can, and use 2 cans of coconut milk to make it a little thinner so that I can serve it over rice. The spices are perfect- even with the extra can of coconut milk. (I use lite coconut milk as I find the regular to be a little too "coconutty" for me.)

We just made this for dinner tonight.  We left out the peas, and added some edamame, carrots and red bell pepper - this added some nice color and flavors.  Next time I would substantially reduce the cayenne pepper - this certainly made it spicy and, for me at least, it drowned out the other good spices in the dish.

Fantastic! My wife and I both loved this healthy vegan dish. We cut the cayenne pepper by half because we were having a jalapeno based side dish but there's still a little hint of heat. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Served over Jasmine rice.

We loved it and did not miss the meat.  I will be making this again as it's filling, spicy and makes a lot!  The flavor seemed to turn out better than most curries I make myself (which usually have chicken).  I did not have canned or frozen peas; so I used a bag of frozen cut spinach and it had a saag kind of feel.

I tried this out for the first time yesterday, and it came out pretty good.  I think I boiled my potatoes too long, because the texture of the curry was much like potato leek soup - not bad, but not what I was expecting.  Anyway, that was my blunder!

I used the ready-minced garlic in a jar, less onion and tomato (due to a boyfriend who doesn't like either), and completely omitted the cayenne pepper (I wasn't looking for a spicy dish, but wanted to try an easy Indian curry at home).

The next time I try this, I'm going to use more potatoes as other people suggest (and not boil them as long!) and reduce the amount of coconut milk used.  It was very saucy, but perhaps too much.  But I agree with whoever said the spice combination was spot on - mmm mmmm!  Very tasty.

Great flavour! I am very picky about curries, but this one totally met my standards. Feel free to use whatever hardy vegetables you have (except for potato, that's a must). Also , pay attention to the 'spicy' part of the title - it's no lightweight! Keeps well in the fridge.

So delicious! I should've served it with Naan bread because there was a delicious sauce worth sopping up!
It is a nice spice level, and I am a very spicy food lover. Just enough heat to make it hard to stop eating. YUM!

Very good, but a bit bland. I reduced the garam masala by half, that seemed like a lot, maybe that's why but I don't quite think so. I used my own curry powder, which I find much tastier and very easy to make esp. if you have a mortar and pestle. Next time I will add something to fill out the flavor a bit.

I strongly recommend this step for coconut milk based curries, as I always do:

Make sure you get a brand where the white oil separates from the clear liquid (those labeled as "concentrated" won't do.) Take pains not to shake the can. Carefully spoon the semi-solidified white oils off and into a wok, add the curry powder. Heat over low/medium flame, stirring and scraping constantly, until the oil separates from the solids. If you use a good brand there will be a great deal of oil--I omitted the vegetable oil entirely. Follow the recipe from then on, using this as your oil. Save the remaining coconut liquids in the can (and whatever solids remain, it's impossible to separate them all out) and add as in the recipe, with extra water or broth (I used the bean broth) if required. This makes a big difference in flavor, really cooking the coconut oils thoroughly, and combining them with the spices, rather than just mixing them in.

I eat curry a lot. This is delicious! I used Red Indian Chilli Powder in place of the cayanne pepper. (I would only suggest this if you LOVE heat though, and 1 tsp will do you, 1/2 a tsp if you want it a bit more mild) Gives it a really authentic taste though, YUM!!! Thank you for this recipe!

I thought this was fabulous, my boyfriend thought it was a bit bland.  I had to change a few things based on what I had at home...I didn't have any gram masala and had only dry ginger (not fresh).  I also used frozen peas, and added in extra some extra potatoes and veggies (based on others recommendations).  I followed everything else and served over rice.  I totally loved it!

This is a really GREAT recipe! Some said it was soupy but I accidently over cooked my potatoes so it turned out thicker which was actually a good thing.

Tasty and easy to make. The kind of recipie you can tweak to your own tastes and desires. Definitely spicy as is, even to my hubby who is very heat tolerant.   I'm fairly wimpy and had a hard time eating this without cutting the curry and cayenne in half.  Otherwise, very tasty.

This was a bit on the spicy side for my kids. I used tomato paste instead of diced tomatos, which seemed to work fine. Next time i will decrease the amount of cayenne pepper.

this is a mediocre potato/pea/garbanzo curry recipe. It is stated spicy but we were on fire!!! I would recommend decreasing the spices unless you like really hot!!! (at indian restaurants I usually order medium for spiceness)

Delicious!  My husband said it tasted like it was from a restaurant!  I remembered the ginger at the very end so I just sprinkled on a little dried ginger, but I'm not sure that made any difference.  I like spicy food but this was pretty hot, so I would probably tone down the cayenne next time.  I also added some agave nectar at the end because the coconut curries I've tried have always been sweet and I like it that way.  Just made this for a second time using a cut up head of cauliflower, two medium sized red potatoes and frozen peas, and it tasted great.  Next time maybe I'll try eggplant and potatoes.  I also cut the cayenne to 3/4 teaspoon and the heat was much more manageable but still had a kick.  The last change I made was to use light coconut milk and the results were still tasty.  I love this recipe!

This is more a 4.5. I would do half the chickpeas, double the potatoes and peas, and only 1 tsp MAX of the garam masala. When I made it I only used 2 tsp and it was STILL overpowering! I had to add lots of cumin and more curry powder to balance it out. It's very good though. I made the mistake of using HOT curry sauce AND using all the cayenne asked. That was my bad cos, though I love spicy food, it was too much. It really took away from the nice flavors of the dish. Otherwise, I love it. And totally plus that it's vegan :)

this is a really great recipe!  I changed up the spices a little.  I use Tahini spices in place of the curry, ginger and gram masala. 

My husband usually grills a piece of meat for his and chops it up.  I have had it both with and without meat.  I like it both ways!

A keeper for sure!

This was a tasty recipe, but i did follow some recommendations. I used only half the cayenne and it was still very spicy, but not palate-burning. I also cut the salt in half due to dietary restrictions. I felt it was missing something at the end so i added a tbsp of brown sugar and a teaspoon of lime juice. Also used frozen green beans as we were out of peas. I would experiment with this recipe again and am looking forward to tasting the leftovers!

Wow. In reading some of these other reviews, I'm wondering if I made the same recipe everyone else did. This was so hot my wife could not eat it at all (despite the fact that she and I both love spicy food) and I pretty much burned my mouth off. I should have known when it called for 1 1/2 tsp cayenne!!
I loved the flavor initially (for the three seconds before the pepper kicked in) so I still rated it 4 stars. I'm going to try it again with only 1/2 tsp cayenne or less.

It's funny to give this four stars when I could barely eat it, but I recognize that I'm a wimp when it comes to hot foods.  This was too hot for me--I loved the tastes but the afterburn got me.   I passed it on to a friend with a hardier set of tastebuds, who said it was excellent.

I would suggest cutting way back on the cayenne if you need a milder take.

MegKat, I created this account bc of you! Thanks for this recipe. I don't even remember how I found this site, but here I am! I'm trying to become vegan, and it's a welcomed challenge :). I read a lot of the customer reviews and: used less cayenne, diced fresh tomatoes instead, and kept the rest the same. I and my friend, loved it! Many thanks.

meh.  Edible, spicy (used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, which is enough), good texture, but flat.  Missing something that I cant figure out... I finished my bowl, but not looking forward to eating the rest of the big pot I made.  I like recipes where I can't wait to eat the rest the next day.  I may just bring it to work and let other people eat it.

I made this for my daughter who is a Vegan.  She isn't particularly fond of Indian spices and hates peas.  So, I added spinach (frozen) and eliminated the curry powder, garam masala, peas and coconut milk.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  I also spiced it up a bit more with crushed red pepper flakes.  She loved it.  My husband loved it too.  I have made this recipe a couple of times and it gets better every time.

I've been using allrecipes.com and have never left a review until now. I thought this recipe was great! I'm on a cleansing diet & am limited to only veggies, fruits, and no dairy. This recipe was very filling. I did change one thing. I used sweet potatoes instead of the regular, but still great flavor. I also only did 3 servings instead of the original 6 the recipe calls for. Like a lot of the reviews suggest, I should have used more potatoes as there was a lot of sauce left. Also, I LOVE super spicy food, and following the measurements for 3 servings, this was SUPER spicy, even for me, but great...just a warning. All in all, it was exactly what I was hoping for, for the most part, and filled me up. I can't wait for leftovers at work tomorrow!

We didn't care for this very much. It was very spicy, and I didn't even add all the red pepper it calls for. I ended up adding a bunch of fresh tomatoes to cut down the spice. I may check my expiration dates, but there wasn't much flavor under the spicyness.

Delicious curry. On the spicy side, but just right for my taste. It made more than I expected and would be a great dish for a party or gathering.

im just getting into cooking and i like making things in large portions so i can have them ready to bring to work.  i tried this recipe which was simple enough (and taught me about letting the onions soak up the flavor, etc.)  it was pretty tasty, i should have added more salt.  i used sweet potatoes because theyre overall healthier.  i had a lot left and came home with a group of friends after a night of rock music and beer and shared this with them.  they absolutely loved it.

This was VERY good! It needed a bit more "ummmmpppphhhh" so added a bit more hot pepper and threw in a handful of dried apricots. I know to some of you that doesn't sound so good but it hit my tastebuds! Was a fantastic dinner for me.

Very good recipe. I am from Goa, India and when I first tasted it, it reminded me of curry I get at home! I did use curry powder from Goa though, not sure how the American stuff compares. Thank you for sharing!

This was fantastic!  Next time though I will use less cayenne pepper as it was a little too hot for me. Also I will use more potatoes.  I used frozen peas instead of canned. But all in all this was a wonderful recipe.  Thx for sharing MegKat!

I took one star away only because it was soooo good I couldn't keep the leftovers more than a day. Tasty, warms the face. The only thing I did differently was nix the tomatoes (yik) and add carrots (yum). It was absolutely perfect! (This from someone who's never cooked a curry dish in her life.)

This tastes just like what Indian restaurants serve - so very, very good.  We will be eating again. I added more potatoes like several reviewers recommended.  If you are not looking for a vegan dish then you can add some shredded chicken (I poached mine - adding one small breast to the simmering potatoes just before they were finished)

This was really good!  I just made a rookie mistake - I cooked the potatoes until they were done.  I think the texture would have been better if the potatoes were firmer.  I also added a tablespoon of mild curry paste because I like a strong curry taste. I'd definitely make this again!

My husband asked to take the leftovers to work.  This NEVER happens.  I call this a win!  Only thing I did different was to add one bonless, skinless chicken breast to satisfy my carnivore husband.  Apparently, it worked.

Key point in this recipe: don't overcook the potatoes.  If you do though, it would probably be best to add some chicken or vegetable broth, put it in the blender, and just make curried potato soup out of it.  My husband loved this, we both thought the spicing was pretty accurate, but perhaps because I cooked the potatoes too long (as per the directions) it just tasted like spicy mush to me.

Very tasty! Only used 3 tsp of garam masala so it wouldn't overpower, otherwise left the recipe unaltered. I'm a pretty inexperienced cook, but I managed this recipe just fine, and the result was WELL worth the effort. Next time, I'll definitely up it to 5 (LARGE) potatoes.

This was great! I used 3 potatoes and an eggplant. It was still very liquidy. I would recommend doubling the potatoes, or adding some other veggies, too. The flavor was great! Will be making this again! 
Oh, and it sure was spicy! Yum!

WAY too much Cayenne for me!  I use about 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon and it is plenty hot.  Trust me, I even like things spicy!  Other than that, this recipe is PHENOMENAL and so very easy!  Make it to impress your guests!

Delicious! I modified it slightly when I made it (it's a habit of mine based on available ingredients and taste) but it's a great recipe. :) Use 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for people who can't handle spicy. I used 2 cause that's how I like it. :) This recipe can use any number of vegetables, and I always use brown rice instead of white rice. Once again: delicious!

Each tablespoon of oil has 14g of fat.  To reduce the fat in this recipe saute vegetables in broth and substitute lite coconut milk.  Shelled edamame sub well for the tinned peas.

Very nice! The only change I made was I used tomato sauce instead of crushed as that was all I had on hand. Used frozen peas too!  My son (14) ate his whole bowl with no complaints. That is a good thing!

This smells delicious: it is simmering right now.  I had to alter the ingredients based on those available at the moment, but I think following the recipe to the letter would give it 5 stars- we'll see how my version turns out.  My changes: I didn't have garam masala or ginger: I subbed 2t ground coriander, 2t pumpkin pie spice, 1t paprika, and 1t lemon juice.  No tomtatoes either: I subbed equal amount of salsa, though I don't suggest this bc it takes away from the other flavors.  Due to preference, I added 1 cup sliced carrots to the potatoes for the last 5 min (which btw only took 10 min).  I added the beans drained, but unrinsed, immed after spices bc the spice/onion combo was quite dry.  I also added 1 cup trimmed snap peas with the coconut milk (I used lite).  Time to eat!

Wowza!  HOT!  This was amazing & I would have given it 5 stars, but it was super hot (& I love spicy Indian food).  Next time I will cut down on the cayenne, starting out with 1/2 tsp. & going from there.  The windows are open & the fans are on!  This place smells spicy! (& it's January in Chicago)...

Very good and simple to make.  I used more potatoes and forgot about the green peas. Very good flavor.  decreased some of the spices but that was just for my taste.

Without a doubt the best vegetarian curry I've tried. I started off with half the recommended amounts of spices and then added more after tasting. I also only used half a can of coconut milk as anymore might have made the sauce too sloppy for my daughter's taste. A definite make again for me. Thanks Megan Lee.

This is very delicious, and features three really comforting foods (soft chickpeas, potatoes, and coconut milk). It will be a great thing to make when the weather gets colder. Maybe I put in more potatoes and chickpeas than called for, but this yielded A LOT. Like, at least ten servings' worth, large servings at that. Luckily I have a freezer. Make this and you won't be disappointed (if you like Indian food that is).

Yummy, thick, & comforting! I added some fresh spinach that I needed to use up after cooking the garlic and onions. Didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used a few shakes of Tabasco. Will definitely make this again!

Better than chicken! I just threw a whole buncha stuff in there that I wanted to use: potatoes, chick peas, green peas, carrots. Then I increased the spices because of all the extra shtuff. I think I'm in Delhi.

I feel like the seasoning in this recipe is a little unbalanced, but I can't stop eating it. I'd like to tinker with it a little, but for now, it's a great recipe as it is.

This was wonderful!  I have tried and tried to cook indian food and it never came out quite right till I tired this recipe.  I used an extra potato and frozen peas instead of canned, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly!  Served it over rice with some nan bread and everyone in the family loved it!  This is going to be my indian staple from now on!  Thanks!

Excellent!!  I did use frozen peas, and I often substitute one Japanese eggplant for two potatoes.  This is the closest I've come to the Indian "homecooking" my neighbors make.

Be warned, like the title says this one is really spicy.  I didn't use as much curry or cayenne and it was still a bit spicy for my liking.

My husband and I LOVED this over basmati rice. We also added jalapeno pepper,  but we like our food extra spicy. We served it with naan (Indian bread) from the grocery store.

Perfection!  I did add some cauliflower to the potatoes at the end of their simmer. Didn't change anything else and it was perfectly spicy and creamy.  It's now a favorite in our house.

I used 1/2t cayenne and halved the rest of the spices and it was perfect for us. Added chard,  no peas, 3 potatoes. Served with cilantro raita and cranberry chutney, rice and naan. Yum.

I've made a number of curry recipes from allrecipes, and this is as good as any I've ever made. I used 8 red potatoes because it's what I had. I also made my own curry powder because I already had all the spices needed, and used spinach instead of peas. I followed the rest of the instructions exactly, and it turned out perfect.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I am not a vegan/vegetarian and i enjoyed this dish immerse.  Did omit peas and cayenne due to preference and followed other reviewers advice and increased potatoes to 6.  Next time I'm adding chicken!

Delicious! I used a whole bag of tiny yellow potatoes that I halved (not sure what they were called, but there were a touch gourmet). The amount of curry called for in the recipe was spot on, but I did lesson the amount a graham masala to about 3 teaspoons. I also added a few julienned carrots when sautéing the onions. For the peas, I used a bag of frozen which I first steamed in the microwave. I wish I had naan to serve.

I love this dish! So spicy and flavorful. I used a 3 lb bag of yukon gold potatoes and served it with a side of brown rice. As a huge fan of spice I absolutely loved the spice level but you might want to cut down on the cayenne if you're sensitive to spicy things.

This recipe proved to be a hit with my family.  I was a bit concerned with the amount of spices listed, however the dish was delicious when prepared as written.  Milder palettes may require a bit less cayenne.  15 minutes may be a bit too long to boil your potato cubes if they are cut small or are less than fresh, so check tenderness at ten minutes to prevent mushiness.  I threw in some cauliflower crowns into the boil during the last few minutes to add to the dish.

This recipe is great! Others had mentioned using more potatoes so I did and it came out delicious! I used about 6 smallish potatoes. I ate this with brown rice instead of white.

I made it exactly to the recipe, only added some spinach leaves to use them up, otherwise I thought this was a delicious dish as written.

A bit spicy.  Next time I’ll cut back on the cayenne.  Otherwise, good dish!

This recipe turned out way better than I expected! The spices are spot on and amazingly delicious! The next day even better! Im not a vegan or vegetarian my daughter is so I made this for her. She loves it too! This one is a keeper for real! I made the recipe as is except I dont do yellow onions. I used a white onion.

I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp  to make this work for me as I don’t like things crazy hot. My husband and son who like spicy loved it and I liked it too. Also I didn’t have garam masala so I omitted that and only had about half the cumin. It was still flavorful! It was a good start to our new vegan diet. I’d say 4star if I’d have used all the cayenne. 5  with the reduced spices. Thanks!

TI made it for Vegas pot luck.  Though I am a meat eater I thought this was a very tasty curry.  Every last drop of it was consumed.

I made this tonight with a couple of changes. 1, I used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also added about a cup of frozen spinach as well as the other food items. 
Changes I will make with the next batch: Less spices. Not a lot, but some. I like spicy... but this is just a little too much for me. 
Also, to cut some of the spice with this current batch ( I am the only curry lover in my household) I am going to add 1 diced apple to the pot. I might even just add it at the end of the next batch as well!!

Loved this dish.  Only change - the heat is really high, which my kids don’t like, so I used slightly over 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Given the “lightness” of the dish, it was plenty.  I also used baby golden potatoes so I left the skin on.  This is a great dish!

Wow, this packed a punch.  So spicy we couldn't eat it.  Lol.  Never used these spices before so followed the recipe exactly.  The concept is good and the house smelled wonderful but......next time I make it (and I will try it again), I will use only 1/4 of the required spices and see how that goes.  If you love spicy (and I mean spicy!) food, this one is for you.

good recipe but I cant ever get the potatoes to not turn into mush. it doesnt taste bad but its more of a curried mash potatoes meal or a curry spread. alse there is just a lot of it. I ate it with some naan i made but i didnt make enough and i still had over half a pot of curry left. however tastes really good with veggie crackers. another thing I did was curry tacos, some flatbread with curry and a meat (not ground meat but like streaded chicken), and they turned out good. I made this for 2 people so we had to get really really creative in how we at it because everyday it sat it got spicier. I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice but day 3 brought tears to my eyes. but next time i will half the recipe and use one regular potato and one sweet potato. sorry for the long review but long story short it's good but a lot.

A great curry with minimal ingredients and low cost! I put cilantro on top and it really added to it! I did not put in the masala and used chopped cauliflower instead of peas. And did 2 tsp of curry powder instead of 4. Delicious!

This was excellent and definitely spicy when made with brand new spices. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used more potatoes and at the end it looked like it could use more so I added a second can of chickpeas. I will be making this often!  It is very spicy, my vindaloo loving husband raved about it.

Tried this one night during lent. It was amazing. We ended up making this as the vegan option for our wedding.  This is now a regular menu item for Fridays and during other fasting times. 
It works well with using half sweet potatoes too.

I am not a very experienced cook, but even so, I was able to make this recipe as instructed. It came out so delicious! It is easy to make, and has a nice amount of spice to it. It's even better the second day, and I was able to freeze half of it, and then simply reheat a couple of weeks later. Which makes my life much easier. Thanks for sharing this easy to follow and yummy recipe.

We did not make any changes and we loved it. We will definitely be making it again and may try some variations on occasion  to change it up a bit, but it is perfect just the way it is. We had it for two meals in a row and still wanted more.

Would probably simmer it for a little longer to make the spices and coconut more pronounced and cut down on chickpeas if I were to serve it with rice. However, overall it was lovely.

Fantastic flavor, and a nice substantial dish. The seasoning is fabulous, we enjoyed it as much as any restaurant dish. I prepared exactly as written except that for our taste, I decreased the cayenne to only 1 tsp, and anyone could decrease it more, I think this would still be very tasty without the added heat. Recipe makes a generous amount, I am looking forward to taking some leftovers for lunch, I know my coworkers will be envious!

This is absolutely amazing and as it says in the description 'better than any restaurant curry I've ever had'. It's super spicy so I would go a little easy on the cayenne powder if you don't like things really spicy.

I made it according to the recipe, except that I only added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper (instead of 1.5 tsp).  It was still a bit too hot, so next time I would only add .5 tsp. That stuff is hot!

I am looking to eat more vegan meals, and this is the first  online recipe that I cooked.  My only modifications were to use hot Indian curry instead of regular curry powder, and to add some cooked cauliflower to the pot for  30 minutes before serving.  


My 4 star review (instead of a 5 star review) reinforces the opinions of other people who said that the potatoes shouldn't be cooked for so long.  I cooked mine for 10 minutes and they were just short of being over done.  It all tasted very good, and I will be cooking this again.

this was amazing & super easy. i will make this again for sure. changes i made: i used sweet potatoes instead of regular - delicious & more nutritious. i also used cooked split peas (instead of garbanzo & regular peas). it was what i had & it worked really well. it was super creamy. next time i would use less cayenne, 1.5 tsp was a little spicy for my taste. overall this is fabulous!

Very good recipe. Spicy and full of flavor. I had more than enough potatoes by using 3 russet potatoes. This recipe makes much more than 6 servings. We're on serving 6 today and still have a few more to go. I didn't give it 5 stars because there was something missing that I can't put my finger on yet. Maybe it needs carrots or bell peppers, just not sure.

Added diced carrots during the potato boil, and made it without the chili for the kiddos. Huge hit with TONS of flavor! ??

Very tasty and spicey!  It was ok though, because my family likes spicey food.  I would suggest cutting back on the amount of red pepper added--a whole lot less than the recipe calls for, like only 1/4 teaspoon.

We had guests over that do not eat meat and I have never cooked a vegetarian dish as a main meal before. Came across this dish and thought I would give it a try.  WOW it was awesome.  With the exception of canned tomatoes (I used fresh tomatoes) I followed the recipe exactly. It was very easy to make.  Our guests own their own reasturant. I guess you could say the biggest compliment was our guest having two full plates and telling me how awesome the food was. I am definitely making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

i recently went vegetarian and wanted to try some new recipes and i really liked how this one turned out! i made it exactly as it said but i doubled the recipe so i could eat it during the week, being a college student doesnt grant me much time to cook. the spices build as you eat and its not overpowering! i would definitely make again!

This was excellent! It's the most delicious curry I've ever eaten. The only changes I made was using red onions instead of yellow ones. I doubled the recipe. If you don't want it as liquidity, use only 1 can of coconut milk instead of 2 when you double the recipe. It's so good that my husband also raves about this dish!

This was so good!! I followed the recipe exactly how it is and honestly just the aroma of all the spices had my daughters coming into the kitchen asking what smells so yummy!! My family loves curry so to be able to make at home is great!!

It's spicy, next time I will use 1/2 as much cayenne pepper. It was good and filling and had a good flavor.  I will make this again.

Almost made this 5 stars, except for the fact that it was a little too spicy for me! I'm TOTALLY going to make this again, but next time with probably a 1/4 of the cayanne pepper. I followed other reviews and added more potatoes and less chickpeas-- I think the ratio turned out great. Perfect dish for my husband and I as we are on the Daniel Fast right now. Will save this recipe for later--- can't wait to try with some homemade Naan!

Loved it! I didn't have garam masala or cumin, so I just added some turmeric instead. Would definitely recommend adding more potatoes, and serving it over your choice of rice! I was sceptical about how much cayenne it called for since I have a low tolerance for spice, but it was perfect. This is a great recipe to feed a family, or for meal prepping over the week.

I made this recipe tonight for my son who is vegan.  It was fantastic!  seasoning was spot on!  Only 2 additions I made we're I diced 3 carrots to add in (I boiled with the potatoes), and added a little corn starch to make the sauce a little thicker.  I will definitely make again...soon!

I made this while eating a vegan diet temporarily. It was delicious and way easier than expected! It reminded me of my favorite curry place in town. I could see this even being a great base to add other proteins and vegetables.

It came out great--savory and spicy. I hate peas so I left them out. Also, I used some red curry paste because my  gram masala was out of date. I wanted to add some sweet corn but did not know if that would have worked.

Im a meat and potatoes guy but this is definitely a Keeper recipe! Lots of flavor and very easy to assemble. Followed the recipe almost to a T: after sauteing the onions and garlic I added the spices, stirred well and then added the garbanzo beans,  stirring well again and let them cook for a few minutes b4 adding the tomatoes.  I also only cooked the potatoes for 10-15 minutes so that they wouldn't turn to mush in the final stage.

This dish turned out great!  It is best served with a Raita to cool the spices and bring fresh bright flavour to it.  I also served it with the coconut rice found at this website.  Delicious, even the kids ate it!

I loved it!  I used pinto beans instead of garbanzos because that's what I had and that came out great.  I will use half of the cayenne next time though.

Quite possibly a perfect recipe! I use a sweet curry which enhances the other spices flavor. I also thin the curry with water to suit my texture preference. Easily makes 6 to 8 servings per recipes.

It was delicious and easy to make. It had the perfect amount of spice and flavor without being too much for the senses. I followed the recipe exactly and I plan on making it a regular staple in my recipe book. Best of all: it’s vegan.

We make this whenever my vegan daughter visits but we all love it.  I do cut down the spices a bit as has been suggested in other reviews.

This was just what I was looking for to help me start to feel better. Plus it was 29° this morning and something warm sounded wonderful, and this hit a the spot.  Even my non plant-based hubby will love it.. I added Cauliflower and another potatoes fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned. I also used red pepper flakes instead if cayenne pepper. Yummy...

I made according to directions but used fresh spinach instead of peas.  I think many may find it a bit spicy so probably the Cayenne Pepper can be reduced in half.  I didn't think the color was appealing it was a bit too brown looking so I added a bit of Turmeric to make it a bit more yellow.  Next time I will use a half of can of Chickpeas rather than a full can and double the potatoes.

This was so delish and flavorful. I adapted it to use in my Instantpot, but used the same ingredients. I put all the ingredients together except for the peas and chickpeas into the Instantpot and cooked that, after it was done I added the rest of the ingredients.

Great vegan curry recipe that works as a whole meal. I added white corn for a little sweetness along with kale, squash, and mushrooms. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious and easy to make. It’s also easy to add veggies that you need to use up. 1.5 tsp of cayenne pepper was too spicy for me though, so I would start with a 0.5 tsp if you’re worried about it.

I made exactly as directed BUT totally forgot to add the ginger! We're not huge ginger fans, but I was interested in tasting it in this. Anyway, this was very good! I may use coconut oil in the future as I really like being able to taste the coconut a little bit more, but all in all this was SO good!

I was skeptical about this recipe but it came out great! I didn't have the garam masala. I added a bit more of curry & cumin. I used pinto beans & carrots instead. I would definitely make this for an event. Yum!

Pretty tasty! I did do some alterations according some of the other reviewers - added 2 more potatoes, and halved all the spices (that was more than enough for my palate). I also added some deep-fried tofu, and left out the peas, but that was just what I was craving for the week. Will be making this again!

Very good, I've made it twice now. The first time I didn't cook the potatoes quite long enough and I needed to add a bit more cayenne pepper. Due to many reviews saying that there weren't enough potatoes, I used 6; this was honestly way too many! Adding a few pinches of salt really brought out the flavor! If your dish tastes bland, don't add more cayenne or spices; add salt! I reheated leftovers and experimented with adding greek yogurt for a more creamy, tangy flavor. This turned out well! I ended up adding a bit more cayenne  when I did this.

The second time, I didn't have any coconut milk, which I think hurt the dish. It also ended up being super spicy, which was unexpected. I actually overcooked the potatoes a bit this time around, but they still tasted great. I only used 2 potatoes this time (it was all I had on hand), but I cut them into very small pieces. I recommend doing this because it makes it seem like there is way more potato than there actually is. 2 potatoes was definitely a better amount than 6 potatoes! The recommended 4 potatoes would probably be a happy medium.

In general this dish makes a lot lot lot of food; the first time w/ 6 potatoes I filled two enormous tupperwares and my friend and I each had a big bowl. The second time w/ two potatoes filled an enormous tupperware and about a third of a medium-sized tupperware. I'll be having these leftovers by myself for days, and won't regret a bite!

Better than I was expecting! I'm a big meat eater, so I was skeptical to how much I would like this dish. It's delicious and extremely filling. This definitely will be a go to future dish for me. I don't understand the reviews saying they found this bland, there are quite a few ingredients and so many spices. If you follow the recipe as stated it should come out delicious.

I made this for a party where some people were vegan and others were dairy sensitive.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I got compliments all night long.  Make sure you make enough because I ran out after people had thirds.  Excellent!

I read some other reviews and made the following changes:
6 potatoes
Coconut oil
5 cloves of garlic
4 tsp whole cumin seeds
3 tsp curry powder
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp ground ginger (this one was only because I ran out of fresh - I will definitely use fresh next time)
28 oz can diced tomatoes
19 oz chickpeas (that's the size of the cans here)
No cayenne pepper
The few other ingredients remained the same.  I sauteed the cumin seeds in coconut oil for a few minutes before adding the onion, then after the onion was ready I added the garlic and remaining spices. I think this enhanced the flavour very nicely and my husband (who is not a fan of vegan) said it was very flavourful. I'm very glad I didn't put in the full amount as listed as it would have overpowered the dish I think.
I didn't put in any cayenne as I wanted my little guy to be able to eat it and he doesn't like spicy. My husband just added some after the fact. 
I'm going to add it to my vegetarian rotation.
It went well with rice and yogurt.

This was absolutely delicious.  Even my picky 11 year old and my if-it's-vegetarian-I'm-going-to-die husband liked it. I am going to have fun experimenting with lots of different vegetable combinations. I substituted cauliflower for the potato and omitted the cayenne.

This was delicious! I trimmed the amount of cayenne and ginger down because I don't prefer a lot of heat. I added and extra tsp of curry and I also added fresh cilantro. I'm glad I added the cilantro because I really think it brought all the flavors together with something fresh. I will definitely make this again!

This is the third time I make this and it always comes out so good but this time around I used 6 red potatoes and 2 teaspoon of curry since my husband said it gave him heartburn so let’s see what he says this time I also add vegetables boulin such as knorr for some flavor and it has a great taste

This is really excellent! I followed it pretty closely, except I didn't put in as much cayenne pepper and also used less salt. I used frozen peas and put them in the very last few minutes. Our  son's vegan girlfriend loves this! We all do! Thank you for the recipe!!

Followed the recipe exactly. This was the first time I tried a curry that wasn't thai and the first time I used Garam Masala. The Garam Masala overpowered every other flavor in the dish. Rest of my family wouldn't eat it. I froze most of it bc I don't like to waste food. I'll force it down with lots of sriracha.

I didn’t think I would like it, but thought I’d give it a try. Was I glad I did. I really liked the flavor, albeit a little too spicy. I’ll cut down the cayenne pepper a bit next time.

Awesome! Deeelish! Cut back the chili pepper to 1/2tsp, the amount the recipe called for would have overpowered all the great flavors. You will want seconds!!!

I double the recipe and make a huge batch!  This is the best curry I've ever made.  I use frozen peas, add mushrooms, and take out the chick peas.

Based on several reviews saying this was saucy, I added two extra potatoes and a small head of cauliflower. I added a Serrano pepper because I was in the mood for extra spicy; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I’m giving it 4 stars because without the extra potatoes and cauliflower, it definitely would have been too soupy, otherwise the flavours were amazing.  It didn’t need the Serrano- whew that was a spicy dish! Fabulous and flavourful! I will be making this again.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing, and I wish I had coconut milk to add to it as the recipe calls, but oh well, I didn't have any. It was still pretty awesome and healthy too.

I made this last night as written except that I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 tsp.  Thank goodness I did because it was still kind of hot.  I did not feel that there was too much of the other spices.  It tasted great.  This one went in the favorites folder.  Thank you.

Needed something but not sure what.  Just starting to try different Indian dishes after noticing an Indian grocer down the street from work.   Enjoyed by 4/5 family members.  Will make again.

Someone from work handed me a bag of potatoes and onions and I didn't know what to do.  I ran across this recipe and loved it.  The whole house smelled great while I was sauteeing the onions garlic and ginger with the spices.  

The only small addition I made which seemed to round out the spices was a teaspoon of ground coriander and cut down to 1 t of salt.

Not my favorite, but the family liked it.  For me, there was too much curry flavor (and I even cut the curry in half), particularly the second day once the flavors blended.  I used fewer potatoes and added frozen mixed veggies; also cut the spice in consideration of the kids' palates, although the grownups added spice back in at the table.  Not bad, not great, for us.

I agree with some of the others. I also LOVE spicy food, but decided to cut back on the cayenne significantly. Even after doing so, it was still far to spicy and overpowered the other flavours, the coconut was barely detectable.  Will try the recipe again using perhaps 1/8 - 1/4 tsp of cayenne not the 1 1/2 tsp the original recipe called for.

Delicious!  I didn't expect it to be as good as it is, but tastes just like a dish you would get at a really good Indian restaurant.  Although I like it spicy, I may cut down the cayenne pepper by just a bit next time.

I liked this recepie a lot; though I did not apriciate that it didn't say how to cook the rice. I had to look on google, and it turned out over done. Other than that, I loved this curry.

Great as written! In order to have all the wonderful flavors throughout this dish I sauteed  the onions, garlic and spices (except the Garam Masala) with the potato’s, then cooked the potato’s in the diced tomatoes (28 oz can),  stirring  frequently  I added the Coconut Milk when the sauce thickened and after 15 Mins, when the potatoes were cooked and full of flavor I added the Garbanzo Beans,  Peas, Ginger and Garam Masala, stirring for another 5 Minutes over low heat. Delicious!

This recipe is delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe directed, and the flavor combination was fantastic.  Even my 11 year old loved it and went back for seconds.  The consistency turned out great as well; a hearty meal with a little broth. I am saving this one to make again.

This is truly delicious. I added celery, carrots and mushrooms and changed the regular canned tomatoes to fire roasted. I added butter and garlic to my rice and it complimented this recipe well. If you don't love spicy you may want to adjust the amount of cayanne and curry by half.

Instead of adding salt, I was generous with the spices, adding 20-40% more of each. The only exception was the cayenne pepper, of which I only added about 3/4 tsp (half of what the recipe called for). I also added 2 cups of crushed tomatoes instead of the can of tomato sauce, and added 3 extra potatoes (I was using small-medium potatoes). Also, instead of the peas - which I was out of - I added a drained can of corn. This was definitely the most american curry I've had, and my family loved it. 

One last difference, we let this simmer for about 40 minutes, waiting for our 2 y/o to wake up from a nap. I think it helped concentrate the flavors, which was nice.

This came out so much better than I expected-I can’t believe how good it is. I used frozen peas instead of canned, only used 1/2 tsp cayenne and it still had a kick of heat, and used half plain yogurt half milk to make up for the coconut milk, I didn’t have any at home. I can’t wait to try it with it though! I’ve been looking for the perfect curry recipe for months and this is it

I made it exactly as directed... Oh My Yum!!! I served it over brown basamiti rice and with naan bread on the side. It was very good! It would be too spicy for someone who doesn’t like spicy. We will be eating this again! Fantastic recipe, Thank you!!!

Fantastic and easy! I use half the salt, and replace the canned peas  with a thawed 16-oz. package of frozen peas or a 16-oz. mixed vegetable package.

I used this recipe as a guideline but added and subtracted things. I only used 2 potatoes because I'm trying to eat less calories, but if you aren't worried about that I think it would be better with about 6 potatoes. I didn't have onion or fresh garlic so I used garlic salt in place of regular salt. I had a cup of spaghetti sauce that needed to be used so I threw that it, along with a can of chicken stock and a dash of milk in place of the coconut milk. I used the same amount of chickpeas, peas, and tomato in the recipe. For seasonings I used curry, cumin, cayenne pepper, and an oriental five spice blend because I didn't have ginger or garam masala. If you are trying to cram more veggies in your meals, I think some spinach could be added and would taste great! I prepared this to eat all week, and it definitely tastes better as leftovers. This is one of my favorite meal preps I've done so far and I will be making it again (and adding spinach next time)

This is delicious! I’ve been looking for plant based recipes and this hits the spot. It was super easy! I made it according to instructions, but did follow one reviewer’s recommendation to use laaaarge potatoes and I cut them into small pieces. It definitely is spicy (I have a mild palate), but not unbearable. You can always cut down the cayenne if you like less heat. The attached photo is before it simmered down more so the sauce did thicken and it’s much less soupy.

Really good. I used chopped red jalapeno instead of cayenne pepper, and I only added 1/2 can of coconut milk, since I wanted to use it up. Also, I didn't add peas, but I did add tofu.

As someone stated this was much tastier than expected.  I actually made this as a dish for New Year's dinner for a special lady who is a vegetarian making the transition to vegan.  She loved it, the spices were on point however next time I will use larger potatoes and more curry.  Either way it was on point.

I gave this one 4 stars for the aroma alone.  I followed the recipe as best I could.  I used 3 med. Idaho potatoes and one sweet potato.  I think I used too much potato.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. and added l cup frozen peas. I made garam masala from a recipe for substitutions found online.   Except that it was too hot for me (Husband was happy with it.),  I will make again using just sweet potatoes, a larger onion and may reduce the ginger.  This could take it to 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely feel like it's lacking something, as the spices overpower everything. Maybe the garam masala was a bit overkill, but either way, this dish has plenty of flavor to enjoy!

I made it exactly as the recipe dictated, it was too much garam   masala for me .  The dish has great potential and I would make it again tweeking  the proportions of spices a bit.

This dish has a lot of potential! The amount of spices was too much for my family's weaker palate, so when I make this again I'll tone it down, but I will be making it again.

I've made many dishes using recipes from allrecipes, but this one is the first that has inspired me to actually write a review. IT IS AMAZING!! I loved it. My kids loved it. They even asked to eat the leftovers the next day! This one is definitely going into my rotation of go-to recipes.

Will make this again.

I like spicy food but man this is SPICY!  I think I will cut the cayenne in half or more next time.  This had awesome flavor and we loved it though.  I was going to add bamboo shoots to it, but I was out.  Instead I added water chestnuts and it gave it a great little crunch. We will be making this again for sure.

This was surprisingly good!
Initially I thought it was too spicy, but the flavors turned out perfect. Nice warmth without the burn.
Can't wait for the leftovers this evening.
Next time I will follow the suggestions to add more potatoes and cauliflower.

Very tasty. It does seem to be lacking a certain complexity of flavors,  so added raisins for a bit of sweetness. I think the diversity of ratings on this dish is related to the quality and freshness of people's spices.  Will make again for sure!

I love this curry base. I have started using the spice mix in this for other recipes. Ie tonight I made it with lentils, added a can of tomatoes and no fat Greek yogurt for creaminess. It tastes fantastic!

Delicious! I had to use sweet potatoes and fresh tomatoes, since that's what I had on hand and omitted the peas because I don't like them but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I really felt like this recipe needed some freshness to it to contrast the richness of the coconut milk and starchiness of the potatoes. I'm thinking maybe some chopped cilantro or parsley to garnish would have set this dish off perfectly.

I did adjust the cayenne by 1/2...my vegan family said it was "restaurant quality"!   It has definitely become a standard for us.

This turned out great! I just a little less cayenne pepper,  (1 teaspoon),and used cauliflower instead of chick peas. Also used frozen peas instead of canned. Also used about 2 lbs of gold potatoes. It was sooo good. Served with rice can’t wait to eat the left overs tomorrow!

This dish was straightforward to make.  And super tasty. The spices were perfect . It was spicy. But we like spicy.  I added green pepper with the onion as I happened to have some.  And it turned out great.  My coconut milk was well passed the best before date yet was still fine for this recipe.

I chose to make this because most of the ingredients are whole foods and vegetable based.  Also, I often have most of them.  I substituted the canned peas with frozen ones, and it is plenty spicy for me!  Also did not have garam masala so I looked up how to mix it up via the web.  Tasty meal!

Pretty good over all I think! I didn't have any garam masala or cayenne and added chili powder, cumin, pepper, red pepper flakes, and tika masala instead. I Also served over rice! Easy meal and made enough for left overs!

This curry IS amazing!
WE have now made it twice and the left overs are fantastic.
Maybe even better than day one.
I am tempted to throw the curry and some rice into a fresh flour tortilla for a "currito" 
Thank you for the recipe!

Very good! I used a mix of russets and sweet potatoes and frozen peas (instead of canned). Cut back on the cayenne to 1/4 tsp but could next time would use 1/2 tsp. This makes a lot! If only 2-3 I would cut the recipe in half. Served over the coconut rice from this site.

Loved this recipe! I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. only because I don't like my dishes too spicy.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This will now be part of my regular rotation. I'm new to a vegan diet and I'm thrilled every time I find something that tastes this fabulous.

I have made this 3x now and each time it just gets better. The 1st time I thought it was to spicy so I doubled everything but the spices. To me and my husband it turned out great plus we froze the leftovers for a easy no cook night. If you don't have Garam Masala try using the "Easy Garam Masala" recipe by kitchen barbarian

I made this almost exactly as the recipe stated and it was absolutely wonderful. I cut down the cayenne pepper from 1.5 tsp to 1/4 tsp and it was plenty hot for my group. Even for my husband who loves the heat. The combination of flavors is out of this world delicious. I do wonder how much "1 inch of ginger root" is...I used 3 tsp freshly minced and it was not that noticeable. My daughter who cooks vegan a lot said it was one of her favorites. This could easily be used as a vegan main dish.

This is delicious! I have made it several times and they were all good. This last one I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, always use frozen peas, and ate it with naan. It's a regular at my house now.

This was easy and very tasty.  I used curry paste, cut down on garam masala and curry powder.  Still, it was spicy enough.I'm a vegetarian and curries are a staple in this household. I will be making this again.

Great spice. I loved it! I did not have coconut milk on hand so I replaced it with a creamy yogurt. I will have to try it with the coconut milk next time.

We decided to phase out meat and have been looking for flavorful dishes.  I was short  on some of the ingredients, including coconut oil and cumin;  Fresh cilantro is a must!

It was great for what I had in my pantry.  Coconut milk is our new staple.

Made it substituting sweet potatoes for white so I could have it over rice. And frozen peas instead of canned. Love it.

Good. A little spicy for my family, I left out the cayenne and drained to tomatoes, since my kids don't like them

Super easy to make.  So flavorful and even my husband (who prefers hamburgers and pizza) loved it!  The only change I made was to decrease the cayenne to ½ tsp and I used frozen peas.  Excellent.  We ate it by itself but would be even more memorable with naan and  over basmati or jasmine rice.  I can see adding chicken to this... or shrimp... or different veggies.

I've just changed to a plant-based diet, and this recipe will definitely be a keeper.  I followed the directions exactly and it's great.  Looking forward to future renditions with minor changes in spices and ingredients to make it my own.  Thanks!

I did not like the spice ratio. I had to add in a bunch of other ingredients to mellow it out.

Good, but SPICY!  Also, I think a couple of cooked carrots would add a little extra flavor.

I've made this numerous times before. I never had the garam masala but put in extra curry powder. I finally tracked down the garam masala and jeez.. this dish is spicy. HOT HOT HOT so be prepared. It's still really good, but I'm going to halve the garam masala next time because my mouth is currently on fire

I've made this a few times when I'm hosting friends (who are not vegan) and every single time people love it! 
It's full of flavor, easy, and you can switch ingredients to your hearts desire. 
Thank you for sharing, this is an excellent recipe!

Great addition to our vegetarian lineup. Reduced cayenne and salt by half and used 1 1/2 t cumin and 3 t curry;  plenty spicy for our taste.  Followed another suggestion and threw in a handful of fresh spinach before serving. Served over brown rice and with bread.

This was delicious! You could serve it over rice or alone as a stew. Make sure you serve with bread so you can sop up every last drop of that spicy, curry goodness! Next time, I will leave out the salt and just add a little at the table. 2 tsp. was just too much.

I've made this recipe twice. I love the flavour and use of spices.  

The first time I made it with the full amount of Cayenne pepper, and I really liked it. I made it again for some people who don't like spicy food, and I reduced the Cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon, and it was still delicious with a hint of spice.

I followed the directions except: 
1. I added a little less cayenne 
2. Made my own curry powder (A.R. has a great recipe).  
3. Added one diced sweet potato (YUM)
This was DELISH!!  Will make it again when my kids are home, as I'm the only one enjoying it right now!

We loved this recipe but, made a few changes.  Sweet potatoes instead of white, green beans rather than peas, 1/2-3/4 can chick peas and 1tsp garam masala , extra curry powder,        
no cayenne.  It would be nice with some yellow squash and chicken too.

I doubled the recipe as I usually do for most as I like to keep carryover for the next day, but this was more than enough for four days. I now make this regularly as it is one of my favourite dishes. Ample spices make it very flavourful.

I have made it twice so far. I bought 3 more cans of low-fat Trader Joe's coconut milk  (inexpensive and the only ingredients are coconuts  and water) to make it again.  It is delicious over brown or jasmine rice. And of course by itself.

This was a good recipe, and even though I am not a wimp when it comes to spice, this was a little too spicy for me.  The only spice I cut back on was the curry because I only had "Spicy Curry Powder"  in my spice cabinet and knew it would be hotter than regular curry powder.   Even so, it was pretty hot!  I will make again and maybe cut back on the spices a little more.  Served over rice.  Smelled divine on a cold, rainy winter night!

I loved this curry... spicy and savory. It only got four stars though because my wife and kids just "liked" it...

SOOO Crazy spicy, untolerable with that amount of spice, but cut in a third, and it would be a great (and still spicy) dish! My lips are burniing off.

Great recip, I've made it a few times and my only suggestion is to only add 1 teaspoon of cayenne.

This was very good.  I am always looking for recipes that meet my husband's needs for gluten free and dairy free, and that's not always easy.  This fit the bill and was very tasty .  It was also inexpensive and easy to prepare, so it wins all the way around.

It was delicious!  Very easy to put together.  I used frozen peas instead of canned to reduce sodium.  The spices are yummy!  Will be making this a dinner staple.

I did NOT like this. Everyone that said the recipe is bland is correct. I think it's from the over abundance of the garam masala. An earthy spice like that should only be 'suggested' and should not be equal to the amount of curry. It overpowers the dish and you can't taste any of the other flavors like most people said. Definitely a beginner's recipe.

While preparing the curry....I reduced spices due to various reviews, however, in the end...I put in the recommended spices. It still seemed to lack depth so on the advice of my sister, I added 5 peppercorns and 1 whole clove.   For my veggies, I omitted chickpeas, but added potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery, roasted cauliflower, frozen peas 1 cup, and a bit of bellpepper I had on hand.    Lastly, I added tofu.  It turned out very delicious.  I do plan to make it again.

Yum! I just made this and it is wonderful.  Only thing that I did different is add spinach and sauteed with coconut oil.  It is cold and snowing here but my kitchen smells warm and inviting.

I have been using dried chickpeas. I prefer their texture to the canned ones. As it says on the bag, I put a cup in three cups of water, bring it to a boil, and then cover and let it sit. I ended up with the equivalent of more than a can, I think. I also skipped the buillon and the ketchup. Why mess with the great spices? It was delicious!

I made it just as the recipe was written except for using kidney beans instead of chickpeas. I didn't realize I was out of them until I started making it. It worked out just fine with the substitution. I used the full amount of spices, and it was nicely spicy, but not hot. We actually added hot sauce when eating it. My sons loved it and definitely want to have it again.

took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit.  the only adjustment I would make next time is reduce the amount of salt by at least half.  Otherwise I would make no changes to the original recipe....except to double it as it was so good there were no leftovers.

My daughter and I are trying to not eat meat so she found this recipe and asked me to make it.  We both loved it.  I always hate when people write reviews and say " I changed this and I changed that"  but now I am going to do it, but only very slightly!  I hate canned peas so used fresh ones, and I am a "spice wimp" so I put all the spices as called for but only half the cayenne.  It's still spicy but good for us, so if you like it really hot use what calls for but if you can't tolerate too much heat just cut the cayenne in half.

Love this recipe but it turns out better if you cook the raw potatoes directly in the big pot. Just toss in with the peas and cook directly in the coconut milk for 20 minutes.

This really is a keeper! Spices where excellent. I made it the way the recipe states except I did not add any cayenne because my hubby would not eat it if I did. Other reviewers had mentioned about the spices not being enough or that it was bland -  THEIR spices are probably OLD or NOT QUALITY spices. I had 3 yukon gold potatoes on hand, 1 Ruset, and some colorful baby potatoes I had to use up.so I added more potatoes than called for, and I recomend you consider adding a few more potatoes  to level out the chickpeas. The flavor was still really very good without Cayenne. Had a nice indian taste. Next time I might add carrots and sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes to change it up and see how it comes out.

Very Delicious Curry, thank you for the recipe. I made it for thanksgiving so I ended up adding a little festive ingredients into the original recipe and it actually came out better than expected. I added butternut squash, pomegranate, tofu, spinach, and black eyed peas. I combined it with quinoa and bam! A perfect dish for the holidays that your family will love :)

I made the recipe with fresh ingredients & spices from my local Indian market, exactly as listed in the recipe.  It is very simple to make and tastes good but I feel like it lacks a depth and layers of flavor.

I've never written a review but this recipe deserves the effort! Phenomenal blend of spices. I added carrots & sweet potatoes & used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger instead of fresh ginger and the husband loved it. Served over jasmine rice, it was better than most restaurant quality curry I've had. Thanks for sharing!

This really is better than most restaurant curry because of the amount of spices. I use ground ginger if I don't have fresh. Serve over rice and/or with Naan.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I followed direction of one reviewer and doubled the potatoes.  So glad I did, it increased portions but still had plenty of sauce!  I have already shared this twice, will make again and again.  Thanks!!

I followed the recipe but cut down on the cayenne pepper to keep the spice level in check as suggested by other reviews. I also added cauliflower and some ground tofu. It was so delicious. I love this recipe. I can't wait to make it again and again. It tasted like it was from a restaurant!

This is a hearty, tasty vegetarian dish. I don't like green peas, but the recipe is versatile enough to make your own substitutions. I thought the seasonings were just right. It makes good leftovers too.

We aren't vegans, so I used 4 small potatoes, and added some chicken! I also was unable to find garbanzo beans at the local market, so I left those out. I highly recommend this recipe. Simple, filling, and delicious! I will definitely be sure to keep these ingredients on-hand so that I can make it again in the future. I think it would be just as delicious without the chicken, and I may incorporate some japanese sweet potatoes in the future just for fun.

This recipe yielded A LOT. Use a big pan!! I don't have one large enough, so before I added the coconut milk I had to pour everything into a large soup pot.

This is great for vegans and non-vegan households.   Before adding the veggies, I allowed the curry (spices, tomatoes and coconut milk) to simmer for approx. 30-45 min to meld the flavors together.  This eliminated the gritty taste from the cumin and created a much deeper flavor profile.   I was a bit surprised by the spiciness of the dish so I added more tomatoes since I opened a 28oz can and just a tad more coconut milk.  Not the lightest meals but very satisfying.   I served this curry over  grilled salmon for non-vegans and over rice for vegans.  Total palate pleaser!

yummy recipe.  i've tweaked it a bit to my liking.  i add 1/2 cup cashew pieces and 1/2 cup raisins (though i've used craisins when it's all i have on hand.) i personally like adding amchar masala to my curries; about 2 tsp in place of half the garam masala for this recipe. also, i don't cook the potatoes separately. i add a cup or two of water after the potatoes go in and simmer until done; adding more water if needed.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, broccoli instead of peas, and chilli pepper instead of cayenne pepper because that's what I already had in my kitchen, and it turned out amazing! This was my very first curry and it was a hit! Me and my boyfriend both loved it!

I did this on a cold and cloudy (July?) day. Made a few substitutions to match my pantry content...hehe!, but sticked to the course and got a very nice, warming and satisfying mash. Could fry tofu blocks with the onion/garlic spice for a protein boost (Just a thought?!)
Definitely holding on to this extremely simple, easy, yet versatile recipe and I  will do it again.

Fantastic.  Lots of flavor with just the right kick.  I added a medium-sized cauliflower broken into small pieces to the onions while they browned up simply because I had to use it up.  Yummy.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and will definitely make this again.

Even better the second day - hot or cold.  I made a big batch though, so I tried to change it up a bit  and added some left-over grilled chicken.  Wow!   I might like my vegan dishes, but also appreciate a healthy meat alternative.  Didn't take a lot of meat to stretch this into a healthy dish that even my hubby loved.

Loved it! But the one thing I would definitely change would be the amount of coconut milk. DO NOT PUT A FULL CAN!!!!! It makes the curry way too sweet and I didn't even put the full can. If you like more of rich curry, add less milk, if you want it more sweet, add more milk.

I prepared as stated with less cayenne and I minced only half of the ginger, and cut small silvers with the rest. (I read one review that stated  the taste of the ginger was loss)  This dish is so savory! The spices come together to create a delectable dish.  I had to force myself from doubling  back to get just one more spoonful...again and again!

Id give it a 5 , but I could barely eat it! Way too spicy! So good , but had to chase down with water every bite! Will add less cayenne pepper next time so I can at least eat slowly and enjoy it.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit. My daughter in law today told me she'll request often.  After reading many reviews I did alter alittle for 1 I cut the cayenne pepper down to 3/4 tsp, added more minced ginger(love ginger in food), and added 1/2 each of green and red pepper chopped,carrot,and frozen corn (going for lots of color). Thanks for the recipe, always needing new vegan things to cook..

My family liked it a lot.  My teens, who normally can take way more spice than I can, actually found it too spicy, so I used half the cayenne and a little bit less curry powder the second time.  It was still delicious!

I read a few review and was afraid to try the cayenne pepper therefore I totally omitted it. It was still perfect and I am from the Caribbean everyone said it was perfect Roti! just without the bread. Next time I will add chicken to get a Chicken Roti taste but it is a great recipe

This is delicious (great mix of flavor), HOWEVER, it is CRAZY HOT!  I really love spicy food (order a  4 of 5 spicy at restaurants), but I had to double the tomatoes, coconut milk, and chickpeas  to make this tolerable.  I would start with 1/2 tsp cayenne and add more to taste if it needs it.  I did use hot madras curry powder, which may have contributed to how spicy it was.  I don't usually find the curry powder spicy at all though.

Fantastic. I made it with sweet potatoes. I couldn't get a hold of any garam masala so I improvised with some cloves and whatnot, and it turned out great. Bursting with flavor.

3 huge potatoes turned out too be too much for this recipe and the proportions were a little off, but the result still delicious! A full can of coconut milk was also a little too much; I thought there was way too much gravy for my liking (but it was thick gravy). 
Even my Indian boyfriend looked in horror as I was adding all these spices, but believe me it is not too much. I would says it's slightly spicy and just flavorful enough (I have to note that I substituted cayenne pepper with chili powder 1:1).

I personally am The type of person who doesn't deviate from a recipe, I want to taste it as it was intended. However I am a calorie counter as well, so I substituted the four large potatoes, for four small cans of diced potatoes, and it turns out perfect every time. I've made this a lot so another thing I tried is using spicy garam masala and omitting the red pepper, and it turned out awesome like that as well.

LOVE IT! Such a foolproof recipe! 

I am new to the cooking world. I can't believe I can make such yummy potato curry. My family all liked it. I took two important advice from other reviews: 1, I added more potatoes, I used 6 potatoes instead of 4, which fed 2 adults and 3 children. Kids loved the potatoes a lot, so next time I may even add more. 2. I used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and I am so glad I did. I love spicy food, but I was serving kids too, so I didn't want to make it too spicy. 1/2 teaspoon was just PERFECT. 

I'm going to make it again today for dinner, and what I would do differently this time is to add a little bit water (1/3 cup?) after adding coconut milk to make it more liquid. Coconut milk was thicker than I thought, and after simmering for a while, it was even denser. 

Highly recommend this recipe if you love curry!

We loved this dish! Served it with Basmati rice. I read a bunch of reviews before preparing this and made only 2 changes as recommended by other reviewers. I used 6 potatoes and a smaller can of garbanzo beans. I also only used 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  It was perfect . . . even better the next day! I will be making this again.

I made this almost exactly as written - I added an orange bell pepper that was sitting in my fridge, and I heated the spices in the oil before adding the garlic/onion to make a fragrant paste. I let it simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes to thicken up the curry. It was absolutely delicious, and had the perfect heat level.

I enjoyed this a lot. I halved the recipe. If I made it again I probably would put more coconut milk in because I love the taste and maybe less spice.  However extremly easy and yum

I like spicy but the heat was a bit much for me.  Will cut back on the cayenne next time.  Other than that, the flavor was wonderful.  Naan bread, baked salmon (yes, I know, not a vegan meal), and a cucumber avocado tomato salad completed this meal.  Yum!

I followed this recipe and liked however,  I did find it a bit 'dull' in the spices department. It needs a little something something to jazz it up. An herb perhaps? I did follow others recommendations buy adding more potato. Will make again!

Loved this dish!  It is quite spicy, so if you're feeding anyone who doesn't like it  HOT adjust accordingly. I added extra ginger.   It's great over rice.  Left overs were yummy too but the potatoes got a bit mushy on the reheat.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this with more potatoes, minus the ginger root and replaced that with 2 bunches of cilantro (use stalks and leaves) and within 26 minutes I had the BEST homemade potato curry, ever!  I of course used extra spice *I like mine SPICY - Garam Masala, curry and cayenne extra.  I used organic Yukon Gold potatoes, organic everything.  This was just fabulous.  Thanks so much for sharing this easy, nutritious and deelish recipe!!

Yummy- I used 16 potatoes, 8 red that I cut and 8 white that I peeled and cut, (not sure that 4 would have ever worked). I doubled the spices and added one can of beans, and one can each of tomatoes and coconut milk. It was very spicy, but the family loved it (the vegans and carnivores). This is a great curry base.

Thank you for the recipe.  I loved it!
Note to those who want to try it:
I reduced the amount of a few spices, such as cayenne pepper and garam masala.  I also only used 1/2 a can of tomatoes and 1/2 a can of coconut milk.  I added a can of water (for measurement).  In other words, I made it my own and used my intuition.
I still love the recipe so much!  It inspired me and gave me the basis to create a great dish. 
I highly recommend it.
Try to use all the spices in the ingredient list, just use with caution if you don't want it too spicy.

Super delicious and filling.  I threw in some extra cayenne for an extra kick and used dried peas and dried chickpeas to reduce some of the sodium.

Quite good! Like others, I found some of the flavors - coconut and ginger - completely overpowered.  I would also cut back the garam masala to 2tsp, and maybe the curry to 3tsp.  I must admit I omitted tomatoes as we have an allergy in the family. Will try this again with adjustments.

Read the reviews and cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp- we like spice and that was still a lot. Otherwise super good. I used cauliflower instead of potatoe, worked great.

I've made this several times now and it always turns out great! I'm not a vegan, however this is a nutritious and satisfying dish that everyone who likes curry will enjoy. I substituted the cayenne pepper for 3 Thai chili peppers diced which I added in with the onions  at the start. I also added the ginger at the beginning as well. Another minor addition I made was adding a tablespoon of whole coriander seeds  with the spices as I love the texture of the seeds and the little flavor burst when you bite into them. There are all kinds of tweaks one can do based on their own taste preferences once you've made this recipe. More or less curry or garam masala for example. All in all a fantastic recipie and many thanks to the author for posting it!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Used some pretty large potatoes which caused me to use a bit more curry powder and cayenne. Really enjoyed the taste and making it.

i cut the cayenne to 1tsp and it was still too hot for me. my husband thought the cinnamon was overpowering so next time we will cut the garam masala in half and possibly eliminate the cayenne. cut back on the curry too since it has red pepper and other spices in it that make it so hot.add more vegetables

I omitted the cayenne and curry (my family doesn't like spicy and my husband hates curry) and decreased the garam masala to 2 tsp as others suggested.  My picky 5 year old happily ate a whole bowl (without me begging her to keep eating!) and my husband loved it.  Will now be in our menu rotation.  As others said it is soupy so should up the veges (I added a cup of corn, will probably add things like carrots, sweet potato etc) helps if you are just eating it with Naan.  Otherwise, recommend putting it over rice or quinoa.  Really is delicious - very happy how it turned out with appearance and taste.

Our eaters like less spice and I was making this last minute for my daughter's swim team banquet.  I also needed to use what I had on-hand. It turned out fantastic!! I doubled the recipe but added half the amount of curry powder and no masala because I didn't have any. Used coconut cream instead of milk and half the amount since it was more rich.

Very good and easy to make!  I added chopped carrots and "beef" TVP (omitted the potatoes and peas).  I didn't have any garam masala, so I used a little ground coriander instead.  Flavorful and quick to make.

What an awesome curry recipe.  I followed some of the other commenters' suggestions and reduced the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon.  The curry was still spicy enough for my taste buds.  I swapped frozen peas for canned and also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.  The flavor was exceptional, plus it was easy to make.  This one will be going into my dinner rotation.  It was tasty enough to serve to company.

Very spicy and delicious! Warning though - reduce spices if you do not like the heat.  Great dish - very filling and my kids who are vegetarians had as their main course but makes a great side as well.  The only change I made was I did not include the tomatoes.

My wife and I loved this recipe!  I have made this twice.  The first time I used all the ingredients exactly as specified, but I  was a little too casual in the use of cayenne pepper and it was a little too spicy for us.  The second time we reduced to about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and this was perfect, spicy enough to notice, but not so spicy as to hurt.  The second time we did not have coconut milk, so I substituted 15 oz of Soy milk.  This makes the recipe a little too watery at first.  (This will repair itself through evaporation if left out) but my recommendation would be that if substituting a different kind of milk, to use less of it to help keep the original thickness.

I will definitely do this again!

We like spicy, but this was way beyond our realm of spicy. I only used a quarter teaspoon of cayenne and the teaspoons of curry, but left the marsala alone. It was ok, but we couldn't even eat it all because it just tested like spicy, you couldn't even get a sense of  flavor. If I made it again I would probably half the spice measurements to start.

I have made this twice now and it is phenomenal!  I made it with potatoes the first time and sweet potatoes today. Both ways are just spectacular. The only changes I made were the sweet potatoes and I also added cauliflower both times just to have an extra veggie, everything else stayed exactly the same. Make it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have to say that when this was simmering, my mouth was watering. It smelled exactly like my favorite dish at my favorite Thai restaurant. However, it didn't taste like it. Spice was there, heat was there (if you don't like heat, scale back big time on the cayenne). but that was it. I feel this dish is missing a slight sweet aspect to it. I'll try this again, but with some omissions and additions to suit my taste.

This was filling and worked out great. I did not have masala or ginger and basically made it to get rid of canned potatoes, garbanzo beans, and some leftover coconut milk.  I used white onion and cubed fresh tomatoes. I drained and rinsed the potatoes, garbanzo beans and peas. I will make this again and use regular potatoes. My husband, who usually does not like curry, went back for seconds.

Leave out garbanzos beans next time. Put garam Marsala, tumeric, cumin in with onions.  Instead of Cayenne, used one total Serrano pepper (all seeds) - was perfectly spicy. Diced Yukon gold potatoes (8) before boiling so cook faster. Used 14oz size of diced tomatoes & then added a 7 oz can since I doubled the potatoes and needed more sauce.  Used frozen peas/carrots & added cauliflower (nuked first to soften).  Used full can of lite coconut milk rather than heavy cream. Added cashews.  Would be good over rice.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written; didn't change a thing.  It was absolutely delicious!  All of my spices were fresh and it was the best curry I have ever eaten!  My husband loved it and said it was the best he's ever tasted and never got that flavor in the Indian restaurants!  Our son and daughter-in-law absolutely loved it and the recipe went home with them too!  It was spicy but not too hot to handle and all of the flavors were in harmony; there wasn't any one spice that dominated the others.  It was perfect just as written.  I will make it again soon as my husband said he'd like to have it again for dinner very soon!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out okay for me.  It was a little too spicy for my taste and I wasn't able to taste the ginger or coconut milk. If I make the recipe again I will reduce the amount of cayenne pepper.

I modified it just a tad, based on what I had in the house. No masala, no coconut milk. I changed chick peas to red beans and the curry I split with 2 tsp yellow curry and 2 hot madran curry. EXCELLENT. I used it as a side dish. Only problem I had my way was tooo hot for my wife. Less hot curry next time. But a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except one extra potato and only 1 tsp of cayenne. Although it was good, it was too spicy for me to fully enjoy. Cayenne is one of my favorite spices because I like heat, but even this was too much for me. Next time I will use 1/3 tsp only, and I will also leave out the ginger for personal preference.

It's just fabulous! :) I found that recipe on a vegan blog where it was proposed and today, I finally tried it on my own. A little unsettled by some "not so good" rates, I was very positively surprised that the recipe is PERFECT. I could say after the first bite that this curry will become one of my favourite recipes :)

This recipe is easy and quick, and tastes delicious! Husband really likes it eventhough we usually do not eat Indian or vegetarian food. If you are really short on time or money, frozen peas and frozen potatoes work just fine for this recipe. You would skip step 1 and just add the potatoes to the mix and simmer for a bit.  Also, I buy my curry powder in the Mexican foods section of the store and it is much cheaper than the regular spice section. Great recipe for an introduction to Indian food. Complex flavors in a short amount of time.

It's very good but too much Cayenne and I love heat.

It overpowered the other spices.

Maybe half as much Cayenne and the recipe will taste much better.

Well...this was delicious!!  I have read various other reviews and the only thing I can say is that if you are really sensitive to heat in a dish, this isn't for you...I thought the spice and the level of heat was perfect!  I cannot stop eating it!!  I am not an Indian food expert, and I am recently vegan, but WOW!!!  This is really yummy!!  Will definitely make this again soon, I made it as directed, and would only add more potato as an adjustment...

Very good!  Second time I've made it and made a couple of changes...  I used a couple of sweet potatoes mixed in because I had them and wow!  The sweet compliments the spice really well.  Also used low fat coconut milk (begrudgingly but we're trying to eat healthy) and surprisingly couldn't tell a difference but cut the saturated fat by half.

This turned out very good and I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the tomatoes and I used frozen peas. My husband gave it the stamp of approval! I'm going to try it next with cauliflower.

Delicious. My first attempt at making curry.  I subbed cauliflower for the garbanzo beans (boiled with the potatoes). I also left out the additional cayenne, not a fan of super hot dishes and the curry powder has cayenne in it already.  No coconut milk at the grocery store, so I used coconut water and a splash of cream instead.  Served over brown basmati rice.

nly added 1 t. Cayenne and 1t. salt, but still thought it was a bit too spicy-hot and salty. The coconut flavor gets lost. Maybe I don't like the tomato with the coconut flavor.

This was good, but I did NOT use the cayenne pepper because I don't like spicy food. I think next time I would add more coconut milk, only because I prefer to taste it more in the curry. This recipe makes a LOT of food and is so filling!

This recipe is absolutely delicious, easy, and affordable!! Here are my tips and tricks: I used two large russet potatoes instead of 4. This yields more than enough, not sure what potatoes this recipe actually calls for. I only used half of an onion as I found my onion quite large. Lastly, I could not find garam Marsala so I just added a dash of cinnamon and ground cloves. This recipe is definitely spicy so make sure you are in the mood or have a nice salad on the side to cool it down! This recipe leaves for a lot of leftovers!! It would be great to freeze some and have easy microwave lunches or dinners! We need more vegan recipes like this!

I'm a meat eater, and tried this recipe.   Um...the best curry I've ever had!  The garam masala and ginger add beautiful flavor to the carribean like curry.   I added more potatoes (6) like others recommended and agree it was beneficial.  I also used a "Nigerian" ground red pepper for extra spiciness!   Want to add meat to this but afraid it will take away from it. Love this!

Delicious!!!!  I scaled down the portion size to 2, but ended up accidentally dumping WAY to many frozen peas in the pan, so I kind of winged the rest of it and tried to adjust the spices.  I didn't use cayenne since I had a fresh jalapeno, I used part of that.  It turned out wonderfully warming and delicious!  The only thing I added besides substituting the jalapeno, was to add fresh coriander (cilantro)at the end of cooking.  I can hardly wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!  TRY THIS!

I really enjoyed this meal. I didn't have  masala and I used red lentils instead of chic peas. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I served it with Jasmine rice and would have loved some avocado with it, but I didn't have any on hand. Highly recommend this recipe!

I would definitely make this again! I used no cayenne pepper and it was spicy enough without it. I used 1 potato and added one eggplant and one package of tofu. I also used lite coconut milk. The sauce was the perfect consistency and it is full of flavor.

I used 1 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. coriander with good results. Left out the cayenne for the kiddo, but next time I'll use 1/2 tsp. for flavor. Upped the salt to 1 Tbsp, swapped the peas for spinach because I had it on-hand, and used large potatoes. Delicious by itself,  but I served it over rice. Excited to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

I cooked this for a load of friends, I added more potato , more onion and more peas (I also used fresh instead of tinned). Despite the fact I cut down the amount is cayenne pepper this was way too hot, all of my guests were practically crying trying to eat it and even some of the braver spice lovers amongst us struggled. Disappointing as the flavours were nice it was just way to hot to be enjoyable.

First  time making any type of curry and it was great!!! Loved the taste and smells of the spices. I omitted the peas and added cauliflower along with the potatoes. I used light coconut milk, it came out very tasty, not salty or thick. It wasn't runny or anything, would have preferred more liquid but it was still great. Good recipe for beginners too!

I have made this several times and it is so delicious! Only thing I change is to cut the amount of Cheyenne in half as my husband thought for spicy it was too spicy. Tonight I made it and put a couple more potatoes in and everyone loved including my 2 year old :)

Easy, flavourful and nutritious. Had to cut back on the heat for the family, and reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. It was still too spicy for my younger kids, so next time I will use 1/4 tsp. Would benefit from having a raita sauce served with, so I will remember that for next time!

Make this all the time!  Husband doubted I could pull off Indian food and requests his all the time now!  We serve it with naan and chicken marinated in Greek yogurt, touch if milk, & garam masala.  Also make a sauce for chicken using Greek yogurt, garam, mint an cilantro.  The whole meal is fresh and authentic tasting!

This recipe was amazing! My roommate can't handle super spicy foods, so we only used one teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 2 teaspoons of garam masala (we had a feeling any more would be excessive). We only used an 8 oz can of chick peas, and added a couple extra potatoes. We also used frozen peas instead of canned, and would use even more peas in the future--they were super tasty! Other than that, we followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great!

Amazing! Substituted a small can of tomato paste for the can of diced tomatoes. Added a chopped green pepper to the simmering mixture. Everyone was licking their plates clean. Served with basmati rice. Absolutely delicious. Tasted like the curry we get when eating out at Indian restaurants. I'm surprised other reviewers found it lacking in flavour. Maybe my spices were fresher, but, yowzer, it was flavourful and hot.

This is my go-to curry recipe. A friend made it for me years ago and I LOVE it. So much flavour, and really quite flexible with a basic veg pantry. I prefer more vegetables, so I sub carrots and sweet potato in for some of the potatoes (some starch is necessary for thickening), and add others like zucchini, bell peppers, and cauliflower. I also often sub red lentils for chickpeas, when I don't have any on hand.

Made all but inedible from the cayenne, and I go for native level spicyness. Aside from that, tasted like waaaayyyyyy to much Garam Masala. I could see it being pretty decent if those were adjusted.

My family and I loved it! I'm half Thai and a lover of curry, and this one hit the spot! I followed the recipe and added Thai Kitchen red curry paste. I also used 5 potatoes and served it with brown rice. Sriracha on top for extra spice is also yummy. The meal was so delicious!

Unless you're raw until 4 or starving, don't make this.  It's so good!  it deserves your empty stomach! 
I ate a TON of it!
Like other said, use 6-8 potatoes.  
I topped mine with vegan sour cream!  It was delicious!

I just started using Allrecipes.com and this was the very first recipe...it was awesome!! Now I'm excited to find other great recipes on this site!! My hubby and the kids loved this as well! I used red potatoes so I actually used 7 potatoes and omitted the cayenne pepper since the kids can't handle the heat! They all said this was a keeper!

I did add more veggies, as I like quite a bit in my dishes. I added carrot, pea pods, mushrooms, yellow squash, zucchini, a couple chilies as well because I love spicy food. I used potatoes, but not chick peas or regular peas because I didn't have them on hand. I also didn't have coconut milk at the house, but I did have coconut almond milk, so I used that instead.  It was very spicy, which I thought was great. I added a bit more curry powder and a little less salt. I will make this again, I already want to eat the left-overs, and I just ate about 2.5hrs ago.

This came out really good! My curry came out a lot thicker than I expected so I watered it down to have more of a curry consistency, but the flavors were still there. I used chole masala instead of garam masala and it turned out great

I am such a curry fanatic and this went beyond my expectations! I loved it. I used red potatoes and red onions and added frozen mixed veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, and cauliflower). I also added 5 teaspoons of curry instead of 4, but that's just because I love it so much. Thanks for this recipe I will be making it often! 
For those who are not vegan or vegetarian and are using it as a side dish, this goes great with the coconut chicken recipe on here by Katie.

I liked it but most of the family only ate half their bowl while pairing with a lot of water.  This is even after I dialed back the cayenne a bit.  I'd probably half that and maybe do 1 tbs (3 tsp) of curry next time.  Was good and not too hard to make though.

We've made this twice now. Once with all the recommended spice measurements, and again with the spices reduced. I loved it both times. I prefer my curry a little sweeter, so I added raisins and a bit of honey (nulling the vegan attribute, I know...) to my own serving. SO good.

This was very good.  However, I made the following changes: I omitted the tomatoes, substituted fresh edamame for the canned peas, used 8 medium red potatoes, half of a head of chopped cauliflower, a diced red pepper, an additional onion, and an additional can of lite coconut milk.  I also added a teaspoon of fenugreek to make it more authentically Indian, and two tablespoons of sugar to appease my wife.  These changes increased the protein, vitamin A and vitamin C contents, and using lite coconut milk (only 99 cents per can at Trader Joe's) reduced the fat by quite a bit.

excellent!  Perhaps a bit hot for some palates.  Top like a sundae with raisins, bananas, chutney, nuts and/or yoghurt.

Just made this recipe today to include in my Indian themed dinner (also making saag paneer, coconut curry cabbage, "red" onion chutney and papadum, basmati rice and potato pea samosas)  The combination of ingredients make the most wonderful sauce.  Next time, I will add mixed veggies instead of just peas.  Also, I use frozen instead of canned as they are a better consistency.

Beautifully done!  While my husband and I thoroughly enjoy spicy cuisine, this dish came off a little too heated--an extremely easy fix though.   Aside from that the flavors are rich and full and this will be made often.  Cauliflower works fantastically well in curry dishes so I may play around by omitting the potatoes next time around.  Overall I'm one satisfied curry-consumer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavor profile!!! Will definitely make again. I did make one mistake however; I used hot madras curry powder on top of adding the 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Super duper hot! I still loved it, but next time I am just going to use yellow curry powder.

Followed the directions, and everything turned out delicious.  It is pretty spicy though...my mouth had the burn after eating.  I think when I make this again I would dial the cayenne down a bit.  Overall a great, flavorful veggie dish.

A little too much cumin for my taste. Next time I'll omit it completely and substitute more curry powder and garam masala.

I made this recipe almost exactly as printed. Only change I made was that I omitted the chilli pepper powder. I felt the curry powder I used was plenty spicy. I used white rose potatoes because they keep their shape better than russet potatoes.
This recipe may not be completely "authentic" tasting but very close and absolutely delicious. Very easy to make too. If you can't decide what to make for dinner, I recommend trying this out. I served it with Jasmine rice.

I like spicy dishes more than most (particularly Thai), and I significantly reduced the spices for my family, but it was still way to hot.  The heat overpowered the garam masala, ginger, and coconut milk.  I used one extra potato, and it was much saucier than what the photo shows.  I think I may try it again, and use the same ingredients in VERY different amounts.

Made this just as instructed, and added a tsp of red pepper flakes for extra heat. OMG this is amazing!! My fiance and I aren't vegans, but this will be a regular meal for us from now on! Yay meatless Monday dish! Toasted naan makes it absolutely perfect!

I made this for company and everyone loved it!  I added red and orange bell pepper strips towards the end of cooking.  Next time I will cut back to 1 tsp cayenne, it was a little too hot for us.

I made this recipe without the ginger root (didn't have any) and my family loved it! They love Indian food and thought that this was better than one of our favorite Indian restaurants. I simmered mine a little longer, which made the coconut milk really thicken up! Amazing flavor and perfect recipe :)

We liked this but it was way too hot for us, and I only put 1 tsp of cayenne.  I will make it again however, and just cut down on the heat a bit.  Fortunately i had some Tzatziki sauce in the fridge and mixed some of that in, which actuaaly cooled it and made it nice.

This was ok. Really spicy and not as flavourful as I would have liked. I think next time I'll leave out the coconut milk - it made the mixture really "soupy". I'll try a bit of yogurt, instead.

This was amazingly good! This just might become my new comfort food.

I made the recipe *almost* as written: I'm not a fan of garbanzos, so I substituted roasted cauliflower. If you don't like really spicy things, then you might want to tone down the cayenne bit. (I like lots of spice, so the amount worked for me, but some people might not like as much.)

I will definitely make this again!

Loved it! Not too spicy, it was just perfect in heat. I used more potatoes as recommended and I was so pleased. I think cauliflower would go well in this dish and will maybe try that next time, but will definately turn this into a regular meal during the cold winter months.

Yum, really good!  I cut down the cayenne a bit (I was afraid after reading other reviews), but think it would be just dandy with it all!  I added more veggies, just because I had them and feel like the spice/coconut milk ratios is really the important part!  So I would say, make exactly as written or as your veggie tastes desire and you'll be pleased!  Thanks for sharing :)

I read all the reviews and was concerned the majority wrote about it being too spiced.  So---I took everyone's advice and cut back.  Tasted it and realized they were all wrong so I added the remaining spices and  thought this was amazing just the way it was written.  We loved it.

I loved this recipe. I made a few adjustments based on what I had on hand. First, I did not have any Garam Masala but happened to find a recipe for it on here that worked great. Second, I did not have any peas but used another reviewers suggestion and added spinach instead. Wonderful substitution. Lastly, I did not have any coconut milk (yikes!) so I substituted almond milk. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was DELICIOUS!  The only changes I made were using frozen peas instead of canned, and I guess I did de-vegan it by using ghee instead of vegetable oil, but it was great.  And the spices were fabulous - I make a lot of Indian curries, so I was a bit sceptical about using garam masala and curry powder, but it was so much more convenient not having to do all of the grinding and roasting of spices, and I couldn't tell a difference in the flavor.  Definitely a keeper - I'll be making this often.

DELICIOUS.  Was it spicy?  YES!  Do I like spicy?  YES!  Can't wait to make again. Below are my changes- also note that after I made the sauce I put it in a crockpot.  I then cooked my potatoes and carrots and added to crockpot and let sit on low for 4 hours.  Then it went into fridge overnite.  Next day, heated up in crockpot for 3 hours on low.  YUMMMMMM!

Changes made:  1 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon Adobo instead of the salt, carrots instead of garbanzos, lite coconut milk instead of regular. Cook potatoes less...a bit less than "tender" 
Omissions:  no peas.  
Additions: 1 tablespoon sugar (heated with spices).  1 can tomato paste.  1 tablespoon lime juice.

This is my first time buying/using garam masala so I'm not 100% sure which of the spices I would tweak, but I would tweak something.  I think maybe a little too much salt, and I'd maybe cut down the garam masala.  I also noticed too late that others suggested bulking it up so at the last minute I added a bag of frozen spinach as well as a tablespoon of corn starch to help it thicken a bit.  All in all, it does taste good, and I will certainly try it again with a few possible tweaks.

This was a great recipe--easy enough for a newbie to Indian, but also tasty enough for someone like me looking to expand my stable of go-to Indian dishes.  We substituted heavy cream for the coconut milk (I hate coconut) and it turned out great.  I will cut back on the cayenne next time, to tone down the eat a little.  The recipe as is is nice and spicy with good flavor, and it's not just hot for shot's sake.

I used 5 large potatoes as one commenter suggested, spinach and two cans of chick peas.  I like chick peas.  drained and rinsed.  consistency was wonderful.  I had a brand new cayenne pepper and oh my gosh, hot, hot, hot but so good.  thanks for the recipe.

This was a good recipe, though intensive and took a long time to make for a weeknight (1.5hrs).  I think the assembled mixture needs to simmer for more than 5-10 minutes, especially with the huge amount of spices it calls for.  It takes longer for everything to meld together. Considering all the substitutions I made, I think it is a foolproof dish that's going to be good no matter what.  I made the following substitutions/changes: I used jarred minced garlic instead of fresh, red onion instead of yellow, 1 tsp of cayenne instead of 1.5 tsp, 1 can of tomatoes, okra and corn plus 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, 3 different beans instead of garbanzo, frozen English peas instead of canned and light coconut milk instead of regular.  I did not have garam masala so I found a recipe for it online and combined nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cardamon as a substitute.  I also added 4 Tbsp. of brown sugar to make it taste more like massaman curry.  My husband LOVED it.  It made 4 huge servings so we will have it again tomorrow night.  Tip: don't forget to get some Naan bread to have on the side!  You'll need it to cut all that spice.

This recipe was amazing!  I couldn't find any Garam Masala so I increased the curry and cumin a little.  A little on the spicy side, but that's my flavor, anyway!  I would use this for entertaining!

My hubs and I are vegan and love curry so wanted to give this a go since it got such great reviews.  I made a few alterations:
Used 3 potatoes (2 red and one russet)
Used about 1/2 onion
1 clove of garlic
1/2 tsp of cayenne (and even that was super hot for us!)
2 tsp of curry paste (since this is what I had on hand)
omitted the ginger
omitted the peas
Added cut up califlour, brocolli, red bell peppers.  
We served it over brown rice and it was really delish!!!!  I will cut the cayenne down even a bit more next time (as it's really spicy with even just 1/2 tsp) and I will add maybe another 1/2 can of coconut milk.  I think with the added veggies it soaked up too much of the milk and we like ours to have more of a soupy consistancy.  I'll definitely put this into the menu rotation.

I thought it seemed an excess of spice. I put in only 1/4 t cayenne, 2 t cumin, 2 t garam masala, and 2 t curry. I sauteed the spicy with the onions and garlic. I put in about 1/2 c of chicken broth to simmer with the chickpeas a bit while I waited for the potatoes finish cooking. I didn't have any tomatoes so I skipped that. Totally loved it.

This was wonderful. I didn't have the garbanzo beans or regular tomatoes so I used a can of corn and a can of fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies instead. I also only used 1/2 the onion. It was probably spicier than normal, but it was still awesome. I am fairly new to vegan cooking but I really liked this recipe and I know I have found a classic that I will make again and again. :)

Great recipe-yes! I'm vegan and oil free and nut free so I used  a few different things.
I used something called muchi curry so I had no need for cayenne. It was plenty hot with out it. I also used Braggs liquid amino's to sauté the onions and garlic. Works great if your avoiding oil. And since I don't do nuts, I used half soy milk and half potato water instead of coconut milk-not as sweet yet does a great job! Everyone here loved it!

I made this tonight pretty much exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious. My meat eating boyfriend agreed. He added sriracha hot sauce to his which was a great addition to the flavors.

after reading the reviews carefully and noticing that a lot of people said that the curry needed depth, I added a tablespoon of mango chutney at the end and let it simmer for 20minutes instead of the few minutes called for in the recipe. it was absolutely outstanding...sweet, hot and tangy! I also added cauliflower and carrots simply because I needed to use them up. a very very good curry with the mango chutney added.

This was so easy to make and quick.  Followed the recipe except only used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper because I was afraid it would be too spicy, and I'm glad i did.  It ended up the perfect level of spicy.  I also drizzled the potatoes in olive oil and baked them in the oven for 20 minutes instead of boiling in water (and I left on the skins).  Other than that followed the recipe as is and served over rice.  It was a tiny bit too salty so I think I'll reduce the salt to 1 tsp, but other than that it was delicious and will become a staple in my dinner rotations.  I love curries and have always been intimidated by the recipes, so glad to have an easy one I can make in a jiffy.

This recipe fit right in with us as we are a vegetarian family.  The only reason it doesn't warrant 5-stars for me is a personal preference of spiciness.  Folks - this is extremely hot!  I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne (my cayenne is quite hot) and although very flavorful and creamy, this ended up a bit too hot for my own taste but my fiance loved it!  If you're not a fan of hot curries, simply reduce the cayenne even more or leave it out altogether if you prefer.  The flavor is excellent, as is most Indian food, after given time to combine.  Thank you for a delicious yet tangy new vegetarian/vegan recipe for my repertoire!

WOW, is all i have to say! I love curry of any kind, but very picky with which ones i eat. This was a perfect combination of spices, i did cut down on red pepper to half of what the recipe called for, and it was still a bit spicy for some of my guests, but that didnt stop them from finishing it. Loved it!! Bravo

WARNING!!!  We cut the pepper back to half, and this was so hot our family could hardly eat it.  We ended up putting sour cream on it to get rid of some of the heat.  I was crying, my daughter was blowing her nose, and my husband was saying Wow! pass the sour cream.  We will make this again with WAY less pepper.  We did add a little salt to ours while eating it.  Guess we are a little wimpy when it comes to heat:)

I liked the basic recipe.  It was a bit hot for most of the family members.  I also felt like it lacked a bit of something so after the first tasting I added yogurt and that definitely added the extra I was looking for.

AWESOME!!!  I added more of all the spices (and used ginger powder),  and otherwise followed the recipe---it was SO delicious, and easy!  I served it with some (somewhat successful) homemade naan and everyone was happy!   I will be for sure making this often.

This recipe was flavorful and delicious! My husband and I love spicy food, but this was a close to being too spicy for us. We powered through and really enjoyed it! I think we'll do a bit less cayenne next time...and have some chapati on the side. :) Yum!

This recipe is absolutely yummy! My boyfriend and I loved it. It was a little bit on the spicy side for him (but not for me, I luv spicy!), I would suggest scaling back on the cayenne for those who are sensitive to the heat. I went back to the pot for seconds and thirds!

I cut back the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon and used 4 cups of steamed  broccoli and cauliflower in place of the potatoes and peas.  With that said...the basic sauce is really balanced and tasty. The process was easy and produced nice results.  I think the sauce will work for any variety of meat or veggies.  Will make again.

Excellent! I only made a couple of changes to the recipe: I used frozen peas instead of canned and I used less cayenne because I knew my kids were going to eat it too. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again. I might make it in two batches next time: a spicier version for grownups and a mild version for the kids. I enjoyed it with naan to soak up some of the sauce- yummy!

As a veggie and a student, you can imagine how I jumped on this recipe. High yield and gentle on the pocket is just my style. I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, and imagine how disappointed I was when I took my first bite.

This is an  alright introduction into the world of spicy indian-ish food, but for those who are used to a good curry, I'd advise you to double up on the spices and maybe experiment/add some of your own ideas because this curry is a tad bland taste-wise.

 There's definitely heat, but there's no depth of flavour, no "yum" factor. I have a lot of it left in the fridge and I'll eat it, but I won't be coming back to this recipe. 

I even waited two days to write this review, seeing as some curries seem to improve with age. No luck.

I'll admit, I had low expectations for this.  I did it exactly as called for except used frozen peas and omitted the cayenne (didn't have any), and it was SO VERY GOOD!!!

Pretty good. Read reviews beforehand and used more potatoes. I'm used to eating very spicy food from different cultures, so I didn't find this spicy at all (which was a little disappointing). Still yummy though. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe, however WAY to many chick peas. I might even leave them out all together. I also only added 1/2 tsp of cayenne as my 3 yr old was eating this as well.

This is very good, very spicy and yummy.  Made a couple of minor changes based on others' reviews.  Used 6 potatoes, 1/2 tsp. cayenne, light coconut milk, and then added some vegetable broth because it was a little thick.  Ate it with brown rice, and added some plain yogurt to cool it down at bit.  Highly recommend this.

I had to iprovise with some of the ingredients because I really wanted to make this but didn't have certain things. It was still really delicious! I used 1 1/2 fresh tomatoes chopped in a food processor, frozen peas and I blended 1/3 cup unsalted almonds with 1/3 cup water because I didn't have coconut milk. I cut back slightly on the cayenne and I served it with plain yogurt. You hardly notice how spicy it is because of the yogurt. I'm not vegan so I don't know if I kept it vegan by making these changes but YUM!

This was very good ... but 1-1/2 tsp of cayenne was crazy hot!  I made it twice, the second time used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne and still found it too hot (okay, I'm a wimp apparently) ... so next time I'll use 1/4 tsp.  I also used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes the second time instead of a 15 ounce can and it didn't hurt it at all.

Wow....this is still simmering on the stove and I can't stop sneaking tastes!  I grew up overseas and my Dad used to make curry all the time...this would give him a run for his money!  I ended up only adding half the can of coconut because I wanted more of the spicy to shine through!  Thanks for an AWESOME vegan recipe!!!  Who says Vegan is boring?  Ha~

Great flavor! After reading the reviews I decided to add more potatoes, one chopped carrot and used frozen peas instead of canned (fresher!). I didn't have ginger. I love spices so I followed the recipe for all of them except 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It is saucy, but is great over rice or with some Naan. I ended up eating it like soup! Will make again!

This was delish...I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I needed a little bit more than the average salt to bring the flavor to life, but it has it's spice! Believe me. But other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I didn't use garam masala. I coupled with brown jasmine rice and a slice of bread, very tasty once I made a few moderations.

Wow! This recipe is what an Indian curry dish should taste like! I've made it several times and it really does make a difference on the quality of your spices, especially the curry mix. I suggest going to a spice house or Indian grocer and buying organic if you can.

Made this tonight and it was a huge hit with the hubs.  This must be served with rice or naan as it is a very complex and spicy dish.  I love how healthy it is-I used light coconut oil, but this dish does not feel like it's lacking.  Be mindful as to how fresh and potent your spices are and moderate as needed.

This recipe is outstanding! The best vegetarian Indian curry I have ever tasted. It has a real kick to it, and the garam masala imparts a wonderful spice flavor. One warning, however - it is HOT. I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp and it is still the hottest Indian curry I've ever eaten. But the taste is exceptional!

Made as written and it was VERY tasty.  Might try to adjust the spices a little next time, maybe more curry and less garam masala to fit my tastes.  Also, next time I'm going to throw in some more veggies.  I have never (knowingly) cooked vegan before, this was great - thanks for sharing.

This has become a new FAVORITE!  Using fresh ginger gives the best flavor and texture.  I substituted a second can of garbanzo beans for the can of green peas.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  It reminds me of my college days living with my Indian roommate who made a dish very similar to this.

Delicious. I have a stack of corn from the garden that I needed to use - I skipped the peas/beans/tomatoes and just used fresh corn instead. The spices are perfect and it made a great side dish. Very quick and easy to make.

Just lovely. I followed the recipe in spirit, but didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it and used my intuition. One thing is, I am all for toasting spices (nice touch!) but from my understanding you usually add garam masala at the end of cooking. Besides that, great recipe, and I'm so glad it isn't timid with spices! Highly recommend. And P.S., next time I make this I will definitely add a healthy handful or two of cashews, yum!

I liked the vegetables in the recipe.  I did also add carrots.  I liked the flavor of the spices, but they were too strong for me.  Maybe I'll try adding less next time or some yogurt?

If you can't find garam masala, don't worry. It is a mix of spices and you probably have some already. You can google the contents and use whatever you have. I only had cinnamon and pepper so I used them and it still came out tasting great. My husband doesn't like peas so I used carrots and it was excellent. Thank you for this recipe, I will add it to my favorites!

Absolutely delicious recipe!  For the garam masala, I substituted: 1/2 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp paprika 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/8 tsp cloves add a bay leaf to sauce while cooking  This recipe rocks!  Your family will love it.

Fantastic. I ended up leaving the potatoes out.  My potatoes were still cooking when I added everything in and I liked how it was then.

This was delicious, but really, really spicy.  I would definitely cut way back on the spices if I made it again.

Really great hearty recipe.  Check the spicyness of your curry powder before adding to the recipe.  I used a hot curry powder and the recipe turned out too hot for anyone but me to eat.  Next time I'll hold back on the cayenne and let the curry be the main source of heat.
