We very much enjoyed this dinner tonight.  The only change I made was to use chicken tenders, and because they are smaller I cooked them on stovetop in my Allrecipes pan.  We only had a dinner salad to accompany this, and we wre more than satisfied!  Thanks for our dinner!

I used chicken thighs and a mixture of crushed pork rinds and freshly grated parmesan cheese with 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning in order to lower the carbs. The chicken came out moist on the inside and cheesey crunchy on the out side. This dish can be varied with little effort if needed.

This one is a keeper!  I used 3 boneless thighs (a little over 1 lb. total) because that's what I had in the freezer. Made as written, except that I cut back the bread crumbs to 1 cup, and the Romano and adobo seasoning accordingly.  Even then I only used up about 1/4 of my breadcrumb mixture, and the chicken was very well coated.  Next time I will cut back the breadcrumb mixture to use only 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  Also, I think I could have increased the initial bake time to 30 minutes.  That said, the chicken was wonderful (served up with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes), and looked beautiful on the plate.  I WILL be making this one often.

I made a few changes just because  I didn't  have  all the ingredients.  I used Ritz crackers  for the bread crumbs  and parmesan  cheese . It turned out great
