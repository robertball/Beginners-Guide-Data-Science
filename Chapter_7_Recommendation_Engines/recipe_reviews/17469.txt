Wonderful recipe, BUT save yourselves a little time. If you go to the baked goods aisle, a lot of stores will have Heath Baking Bits. ( Use Heath, NOT SKOR, SKOR doesn't have the chocolate covering ( and no, I'm not talking the heath Bites either, look for Heath BAKING BITS, there's a huge difference :)  you won't have to crush anything, it's already done for ya right out of the bag. Perfect to use on Better than Sex Cake as well, which is just as devine.

This was just awesome!  Wasn't *too* chocolately either!  I barely fit the whole thing in my trifle bowl, and thought that I should have used only 2/3 of the cake as someone else suggested; however, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, it sunk a little because of the sheer weight of it all.  Perfect!  I used a 7 oz. "Symphony" chocolate/toffee bar, but didn't taste as much toffee as I would have liked.  Next time, I used an 8 oz. bag of Heath Toffee Bits (found in the baking aisle) - MUCH better, and no chopping involved!!  This cake is always a hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a huge hit!    The only change I made was using a bag of Heath milk chocolate toffee baking bits instead of candy bars.  Also, I used a big glass bowl that holds 20 cups, and the cake fit with just enough room to spare.  I made it about 8 hours before serving, which probably only made it better.

This recipe is heavenly.  I love rich desserts, this is definitely one of them.   A big glass of milk is perfect with this one.  Although, I get rave reviews with it, some people...have passed on this dessert...claiming it was WAY TOO RICH!!   Their LOSS!!!   haha!  MORE FOR ME!!!!

I made this for a birthday party. It was an absolute hit. I made a lot of variations though. Instead of the devil's food, I used the German chocolate mix.(i had that at home). The cake tasters are also all trying to lose wt or maintain lost weight- i substituted the cool whip for fat free cool whip, sugar free pudding and used applesauce and egg whites in the cake itself. It was just awesome though! Everyone ate tons n tons of it w/out feeling guilty.

This is a great recipe and is easy to make.  I've made this several times but I left out the chocolate syrup and substituted a good quality coffee liquor. I also use another 16 oz container of frozen topping  (At least half or more)  Freshly whipped heavy cream also works very well in place of the whipped topping.  In my opinion I think that the crushed broken Skor bars work the best.  I will make my own chocolate pudding when time permits me to do so.  Nice recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this dessert last night for my husband's mother's birthday.  It was the best chocolate cake dessert I have ever made.  It was rich, but it was fantastic.  My only suggestion would be to use a second container of Cool Whip to seal on top.  I ran out before I was to the top and used leftover cake and toffee to garnish the bowl.  At any rate, it tasted to good, no one cared what it looked like!!!

WOW!! This is a winner!! My husband can't stop eating this one!! I also used the bag of Heath topping bits, very easy! I used brownies instead of devils food cake, just happened to have it on hand. This turned out so yummy! I will definitely make this one again!

I liked this recipe very much.  I find I don't use the whole cake in this recipe (actually about 2/3 since otherwise I don't have a big enough bowl), and it makes for a very moist dessert.

This was phenomenal. I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was really delicious. I loved how the chocolate syrup made the cake turn gooey and almost brownie like. This dessert is especially good the next day. The only drawback is presentation. In the trifle bowl it was beautiful, but serving it was messy and looked gloppy. But all guests agreed, the taste far outweighed the appearance and everyone loved it!! That was important too because the adults as well as the young children all wanted seconds.

I made a few changes to decrease the calorie content. I used half sugar free/half plain chocolate pudding. I also used fat free cool whip and prepared the devil's food cake with diet coke instead of the eggs and sugar and everything on the box. This was a HUGE hit with everyone, though! You couldn't taste a difference in anything. And it was super easy to make, too!

This is definitely a chocolate-lovers dream dessert. Instead of using just toffee candy bars however, I went and bought an assortment of my favorite candy bars. When they're all crushed up it adds more variety to just the chocolate cake, pudding, and whipped cream.

Wonderful!  I made it for dinner at a friend's house, and we couldn't stop eating it!  I used sugar-free pudding mix with whole milk (that's what I had), and it turned out great.  The crumbled Heath bars are a crucial ingredient, I think the dessert would be too mushy without the toffee crunch. YUM

I made this for my girlfriends baby shower and just added pink food coloring to the whipping cream so it was pink and it was the biggest hit! Everyone loved it, the only things I would change is to have two packages of the chocolate pudding and I used skor bars. mhhh can't wait to make it again

This looked pretty awesome but tasted just ok  after it was made but better the next day!  It's actually lighter and less rich/sweet than it looks!  I would have liked something with a little more density and texture inside like a  brownie.  It was also too much to fit in my trifle bowl.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it.  It feeds a huge crowd and is just delicious.  Plus it looks so beautiful and fancy in the trifle bowl.  I'm making it again this year!

This is always a hit. When I make this for an adult crowd, I substitute coffee liquer for the chocolate syrup. I think it tastes even better that way.

Great recipe! I used 8 crushed up skor bars instead and added a can of cherry pie filling, also decided against the chocolate syrup.

This was AMAZING!!! When I made it I called it my ‘bowl of layered death by chocolate’ The devils food cake and chocolate syrup was delicious and the whipped cream and pudding made it nice and creamy. Were I making up something like this I would probably have just put chocolate chips in but the Heath baking bits were a nice surprise and even better then just plain chocolate. I made this in a punch bowl and it fit just perfect. The birthday girl loved it and I get the feeling that I will be making it again soon. Bonus: it fed my whole family of nine plus a few friends without needing to be doubled!

Tastes great, looks ridiculous in a trifle bowl, comes up only halfway. You would need to double it to make it high enough.  Bowl size to be used for this recipe should be noted. These pics are either deceiving or it was a double batch.

This is just my opinion, but, I feel like a 15.25 oz box of Devil's food cake is plenty for this recipe, but, I feel like 1 more package of instant pudding and 1 more container of whipped topping are needed. Very rich, but, absolutely delicious!

I liked this recipe but needed to make a few changes. It felt a little like cheating because I was using boxed mix, but I'm still new to this. Instead of 1 cup chocolate syrup, I used 1/2 cup syrup & 1/2 cup melted fudge mixed together. I also substituted half of the toffee for chocolate chips (smaller sized) and mixed them in the cake mix instead of having their own layer. Finally, I did regular pudding mix instead of instant. When I made this verbatim, it turned out very soupy. However, with the above adjustments, it came out delicious!

This recipe is a pain to make--lots of dishes and steps and a mess. Unfortunately, it's well worth it.

This is the first time I have ever rated anything.  Everyone I make this for just loves it!  I make it for potlucks now or when I'm having company in town.  Everyone walks away having seconds and talking about it days later.  Whenever it is in the house and I have guests I can always find someone sneaking down to the refridgerator in the middle of the night for a snack!  

My only suggestion is make the pudding with only a few minutes left on the cake.  Otherwise it sets up to soon and makes it harder to spread.  I also buy the Heath bits in the baking aisle to save time.

So delicious! And makes such a large cake. I used my large ceramic crock pot to hold the entire recipe. Thank goodness I did...........it definately would not have fit in any of my large glass bowls....not even the largest one. :) I chopped up mini Heath bars in a food processor, turned out fabulous!

Again, a lot of wasted ingredients as this dish lacks character and taste.  Nothing stood out as singular or dreamily wonderful.  Would never make again.  Out of 8 people who ate it at the party, one said it was really good.
