This was a very easy slaw recipe, and it was mild and tasty. I didn't have the specified nuts but added a healthy amount of Craisins and sliced almonds. Easy to have for a barbecue or share at a potluck.

This was a wonderful side dish for barbecue.  I made it as written, except for the package of accents which I didn't have.  I substituted a handful of almonds and reduced sugar cranberries instead and everyone loved it.  It was pretty and healthy.  I will definitely make it again.  It would be a great dish to take to a covered dish event as it doesn't have to be re-heated and it would transport well.

This is pretty tasty.  I'm going to have to learn how to cut cabbage into thinner strips though.

We loved this recipe.  I am not crazy about mayo, so yogurt was a great substitution.  As we don't care for our slaw too sweet, I only used 1 T. honey, lower-sugar dried cranberries, and plain sliced almonds.  Very quick and easy, as well as adaptable to individual tastes. Thanks for a great recipe!

We've made this several times using sour cream instead of yogurt.  It's absolutely delicious!

I loved it and not as fattening as using mayonnaise. Very quick and easy to make.

My family loved it! I didnt have any rice vinager so I substituted that for red wine vinager. It gave it a pink dressing but the flavor was good.

This was kind of ok. I just didn't love the yogurt, honey, rice vinegar combination for the dressing. I did like the salad ingredient combination, though. Because I didn't have the honey roasted with cranberry almonds, I substituted dried cranberries and toasted almond slivers. Yummy.
