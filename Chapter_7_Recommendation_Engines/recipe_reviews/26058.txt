My husband loves this cake :~)This is going to be one of my "go to" recipes for a delicious but quick & easy dessert. After reading the reviews I adjusted the steps in making the frosting ~ mixed the flour into the brown sugar before adding them to the melted butter, making a roux. Cooled it slightly and whisked in the egg. Cook mixture for three minutes. Remove from heat and add pecans & vanilla. I did use more pecans too ~ 1 1/4 cups. I also exchanged 1/4 cup Amaretta for 1/4 cup of the water called for in cake mix directions and shortend the baking time to avoid the dry texture some reviewers mentioned... and, it turned out beautifuly. Thanks Hillary for this wonderful recipe.

Easy to make.  My praline mix never thickened like the recipe stated, so I just spread it over the cake anyway, and it seemed to work fine.  I would recommend slightly underbaking the cake.  I was dismayed when I pulled he cake from the oven and found the edges already very dark (although I baked it the minimum time stated on the box) and knew that I then had to put it back in the oven for another 8 to 10 minutes.

This was a really nice change from a standard cake with frosting.  
After a horrible week I realized that I had to make something to bring to a barbecue still.  I could have bought something, but everyone is used to home made treats from me.  I have to say this was the easiest cake to make and I had all the ingredients on hand already, which made it even better.
I did decrease the baking time by 10 minutes to combat the dryness others complained about.  The cake was perfect.  I also did have a little troubel with the praline frosting not thickening enough and most ended up dripping down the side of the cake pan.  That is okay though, everyone just wanted the edges of the cake.  
I will sure keep this recipe in mind the next time I don't want to or have time to fix something for a pot luck.

I took this cake to our weekly potluck at my office. I used a cake mix with pudding in the mix. I only allowed the cake to cool long enough for me to make the topping. I used walnuts because that is what I had on hand. And I messed up and added extra vanilla by mistake, turned out to be a lucky mistake. As chance would have it there were 3 cakes brought that day but mine was the only one finished, with raves and requests for the recipe. I will definitely make this again everyone loved it as did I.

I always read the reviews, and I also took the advice of others and cut back on the initial baking time. I used a german chocolate cake mix (with pudding in the mix) as my husband doesn't like a cake unless it's chocolate. I altered the frosting just a bit, as I have another cooked frosting recipe that's similar. Instead of the egg, I used 1 egg yolk and 3 tbls. milk (2%). I cooked the frosting like my other recipe and brought it to a rolling boil, and cooked for 3-5 minutes. This is a great recipe, and it turned out well.

Used a pudding in the mix good quality yellow cake mix, made as directed, 9x13 greased and floured pan baked for 35 min. Made frosting as directed in recipe seemed runny, poured on hot cake and returned to oven for 5 min. looked a little runny but had cooked up, was afraid to leave it longer so took it out, tasted very good, but   leaving in oven 8-10 minutes would have made it carmelize. Should have done what the recipe said!I think it would be divine with some vanilla ice cream!

This is a great recipe - I made it for my family
and then brought what was left (not much) for
my co-workers.  Everyone raved over it.  It's very easy to make.  You may even want to make more of the praline topping for your cake because that is the best part.  Enjoy!

I tried this recipe recently and found it to be extremely easy and quick to prepare.
The taste was very good and appealed to all my family.  The only small drawback 
was that I found that the cake portion seemed a little dry from the double baking
time.  But this could be easily overcome with possibly less initial baking time or
perhaps using another brand of cake or making the cake from a scratch recipe 
that is more moist.  All in all a good recipe and would be great for potluck supper,
picnics, family gatherings etc.  It's a great way to make a cake mix cake seem
more special---like homemade.

Anything with brown sugar, butter and yellow cake mix is a winner with me and this did not disappoint me!  I did make a few minor changes; I substituted toffee chips for the pecans (just a personal preference), and mixed together a thin glaze of milk, powdered sugar and a touch of cinnamon, pokes holes in the cake just after taking it out of the oven and poured the glaze over top before topping with the brown sugar mix.  Delicious!

We enjoyed this cake, however, you really need to watch the cooking time or it can become to dry. Next time I think I'll double the topping ingredients and see how it turns out. I only cooked it at 400 for 5 minutes and that seemed perfect.

I made this cake and my family loved how moist it was.  I have had repeat requests to make it again.  I love that it is semi-homemade.

The name of this cake made it sound better than it actually was.  It was just a regular cake with a fairly thin layer of streusel on top.  I think it would've made more of an impact if the streusel was doubled and came out crunchier.

Totally delicious! I would recommend using Duncan Hines brand for a moist cake. I used their butter cake mix instead of yellow, and soo good. I added vanilla extract to the cake batter. The praline top is outstanding! For some reason, I did not have enough praline coating to coat the entire two round cakes, but I suppose I may have did something to screw that up. The cake was not very easy to cut and was crumbly, which is why I am knocking it down a star. But every easy to do. Family loved it.

This cake is moist and delicious.  I made a half recipe in an 8x8x2 square baking pan and it came out perfect.  It is even better refrigerated.

This is one of my favorite recipes & it always gets rave reviews.  I don't bake the praline part as long as the recipe states though.  Normally I only leave it in the oven for 3-4 min.  Divine!!

I made this cake also cutting 10 minutes off the baking time. I substituted 1/3 c Peach Schnapps for some of the water called for in the cake directions. It was wonderful. Just a hint of peach with the caramel flavor of the frosting did the trick. Awesome recipe and very easy.

Absolutely wonderful.  The only change I made was I used a little more pecans.  I can't wait to make this cake again.  It was gone by the next day.

I have made this cake twice now and both times were a hit, people love it and eat it up with a quickness. I did add more nuts because my family are nut lovers. It's great. I even did it as a 2 layer cake and put the praline mixture in the middle, sides and top of the cake. It can get messy, but it sure is pretty.

I guess I'm the spoiler on this one.  I thought the cake was much too sweet.  After reading other reviewer's comments about the cake being dry, I decided to poke holes in it to see if some of the topping would go down into the cake and make it moister.  Don't try it; it didn't work.  However, I didn't find the cake to be dry at all.  I liked the crunch of the pecans on top and considered putting some pecans into the cake also.  I just didn't like the cloying sweetness of the cake.

This is by far one of the best cakes I have ever had and my husband agrees. It is so easy to make, yet you can not tell by the look and taste. I have made this twice and it is one of the only cakes I have ever made that has no leftovers. This is a must try recipe, you probably have all of the ingredients right now anyway!

The topping on this cake is very good! It only takes a few minutes to whip up and is a nice alternative to regular frosting. I will definitely make this again.

I used a gingerbread cake mix.  It turned out spectacular.  Will be making this for a nice change during the holidays.  A scoop of good vanilla ice cream takes this right over the top!

Yum!  I made this for a pot luck.  It is now one of my go to recipes.  I didn’t have yellow cake so I used spice cake.  My praline topping thickened like it was supposed to with no changes.  Delicious!

Making this cake for the 2nd time! Love it! It's hard to screw up a cake from a box, so using a box mix is a plus. The praline frosting is delicious! I even used it to make some pralines. They seemed to take a long time to completely set but the flavor was absolutely delicious. Different from my regular praline recipe, and a different taste. Highly recommend this if enjoy pralines!

Wanted something quick to make with ingredients I already had on hand and this worked perfectly!  I used Duncan Hines Butter Yellow cake mix and adjusted the frosting a bit.  I made a rue with the melted butter and flour, then added the brown sugar and vanilla.  I used an egg yolk and tempered it with a tablespoon of the brown sugar mixture and then added it to the saucepan.  Once fully incorporated and smooth I let the frosting cool a bit and then spread it onto the cake and topped it with the chopped pecans.  Family loved it and it is very tasty and pretty to look at too!

My Family Loved it! I used a Betty Crocker Butter Recipe cake mix. It came out super moist. I took it out of the oven the second time, with the frosting a little early just to be safe. Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake topping is wonderful! I made it for a work potluck for about 8 people and they almost finished the whole thing! I did what other reviewers suggested and baked my box cake about 10 min less than the package instructed. The cake was cooked just right, not too dry. Delicious!

I made this yesterday. I didn't change a thing in the recipe, (other than I used a Butter Pecan cake mix because it was what I had on hand) it was fabulous. I did adjust the baking time (as others suggested) I under baked it slightly and baked it for 8 minutes after I put the topping in it. It was very moist and very delicious. Super simple... A definite keeper!

This is a HUGE hit in my house. I made one change, and neglected to finish reading the instructions. Haha. I missed the "put it back in the oven" part, will do next time. 
I like my pecans toasty, and I eyeballed it. I used maybe a whole cup leftover from my Thanksgiving pie. Toasted them in 1 tbs of butter before adding them to the "frosting".

HAve been looking for a nut topped cake that goes in the broiler to crisp. My mom use to make for me and when she passed suddenly a few years ago this is one of the things she took with her. This recipe is very close, and I do make a few changes, add vanilla to cake, always Use milk in place of water (makes even box cakes moist and yummy)  I used triple the nuts, chopped them up a good deal and used the broiler to crisp.  The cake disappears quickly, even my pickey eaters love the crunchy top.

Made this for a friend's birthday and it turned out very tasty! We both ate...probably too much. Considering this took little effort, but still enough to show that you care, this is a pretty close to perfect cake!

Best cake recipe I've made in a LONG time!! All my co-workers loved it!!  I followed other people's suggestions on under-cooking the cake and next time I will cook the cake the full cake time then add the topping.  I had to cook with the topping an additional 20 minutes to get my cake to cook all the way through.  I also used the Betty Crocker cake mix that already has the pudding in the mix.  I poked holes in the cake before adding the topping so it absorbed in the cake and I'm glad I did.

This is a great recipe to take a simple yellow cake mix and with very little effort, turn it into something unique and delicious.
