This was very easy to make. We served with fettucine, aspargus and fresh sliced tomato. 
My husband didn't really liked it. He loves his shrimp so is a good 'shrimp connoisseur'. He found it was lacking something, so added some dill. It did add a nice new flavor that we both liked! With the dill he liked the meal but said he probably wouldn't make it compared to his other shrimp dishes. 
I enjoyed it, and liked the different flavor - especially the dijon and dill added. It was super easy to make which was nice too. I liked just about any food so I'm not the best at evaluating recipes. I just LOVE food! hehe

This was so easy, and tasted very light and flavorful.  I used 2 pds of shrimp, and then poured the shrimp and sauce over linguini.  It would be good with some parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top!  I will definately make this again.

Yummy!  We will make this again.  We used 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of imitation crabmeat.

Had it on top of penne and this was deeeeeeeeeeelicious!!! I used Naparker's suggestion and added some dill. Personally, I'm watching what I eat so next time I'll probably use less butter and more mustard, but the recipe is fine the way it is.

Delicious and super easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Earth Balance instead of butter. I will probably add more mustard and a tiny bit more lemon juice next time just to give it a little stronger flavor. It was perfectly good as is though. I served it over whole wheat pasta for a delicious nutritious meal. I think next time I will add some fresh zucchini and yellow squash to the shrimp before I put it into the oven. This would compliment the flavors nicely. It will need more sauce to cover the veggies of course. I will be making this again.

Was good, but incredibly rich.  My fiance loved it, but it was just a little too rich for me.

FAST, EASY, DELICIOUS!  I served it over a bed of linguini... tasted just like "Angel Shrimp" I had a few weeks ago at very fancy steakhouse, in fact, I liked it better.  :-)

oh my gosh, was this good!!  Super simple to prepare as well.  Didn't change a thing except to increase liquids as I used a full 2 pounds of shrimp.  Served over pasta with salad and a bread and it was dinner to die for in less than 30 minutes.  THANKS!!  This is a keeper!!!

This was very good! I took the advice of someone else and added dill. It was excellent. Next time I will try to make the sauce a little thicker and use it as a dipping sauce when its done cooking. Also, I will probably use less butter and more mustard because I couldn't taste the mustard as much as I would have liked. Thanks for the recipe! It was yummy!

Elegant, simple recipe.  I use fresh shrimp, and have cooked them both in the oven and on the grill in a basket.  Excellent either way.  The sauce is lost from the grill basket, making it a lighter dish.
