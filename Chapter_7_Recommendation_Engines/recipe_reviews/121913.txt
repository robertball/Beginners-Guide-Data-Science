I halved this recipe and put it in a 9x9 pan, wish I had used 9x13.  The bars ended up too thick and bland with not enough raspberry flavor.  If I do decide to make these again, I will definitely half the recipe and use a larger pan - maybe drizzle some white chocolate over top to give it a little something.

These were wonderful. Everyone who tried them raved and came back for more. I drizzled a glaze (powdered sugar, almond extract and a little milk) over the top, but I think next time I will try them without. I'll definitely make these again.

I found the dough part too thick and rich ... half the thickness would have been perfect for me.  Disappointed.
