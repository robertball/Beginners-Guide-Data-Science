These little babies are delicious!!  Being a no-bake cookie and rolling them in granulated sugar makes things a lot less messy, too, than rum balls I've made in the past rolling those in powdered sugar.  Little trick I learned....go to the liquor store and buy the little miniature bottle of Bacardi dark rum.  It's just enough for the recipe and you don't have to spend a fortune on a whole bottle of rum (unless you have other uses for it...LOL)!  Recommend these 100% and these will be on my "regulars" list of Christmas cookies.  :-D

I also use confectioner's sugar instead of white sugar... another substitution that I really like is Amaretto instead of rum.  A low rating for "kid friendly" because of the alcohol, but hey, adults need a treat too!

I searched high and low for the perfect Rum Ball recipe, and this is it!  I use Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum......and instead of rolling them in sugar, I use coconut (which you can color for holidays) or finely chopped walnuts.  They make great gifts too....with that personal touch!

This cookie was a big hit at Christmas.  I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum, and had to print out copies of the recipe for about 5 people!  Very yummy.

This is fantastic and easy to make. I used Malibu Rum coconut flavor and it added that special flavor. I then made 3 batches, 1 rolled in coconut flakes, another rolled in regular sugar, and the last in powdered sugar. All came out very very yummy. A keeper for sure.

I replaced my favorite rum ball recipe with this one.  I used confectioners sugar where the recipe called for "white sugar". Very moist and very rich. Don't eat and drive!!

Love these treats! I make these every Christmas! Defenitely refrigerate overnight before eating. I have found that if you eat them right away the rum flavor is very strong.....it kind of mellows and the flavors blend after sitting awhile in the fridge. :)

Just a tip to take your rum flavor to another level. Add two vanilla beans to your bottle of rum and let it sit for a month. Shake once a week sure you have to plan ahead but it is worth it.

These were delicious, may be not so moist. I made these with rum and I tried Amaretto liqueur too. I liked all combinations. I used 1/2 cup sugar.

These tasted yummy; however, the granulated sugar spoiled the effect.  The sugar crunches when you chew them.  I would add more rum, more nuts, and use powdered sugar.

I fixed these to give away as gifts for the holiday.They were a big hit. I also substituted the dark rum for raspberry rum so they became chocolate raspberry walnut balls.I will be making these every year.

The rum is really overpowering, in my opinion.  However, it did lessen over a week's time, and my relatives did really like them.  I added cinnamon to the mix and it gave it a bananas foster flavor.

I tried a batch of these on some friends and family just before x-mas. At least 12 of us tasted them and all had strong opinions. I gave this recipe 3 stars because 1/2 of us really liked these and begged for more, the other 1/2 of us hated them. The alcohol is not cooked out of the rum balls and the taste is very strong.

Pretty good.  I used way more rum and whiskey because mime were a bit dry.  Also be careful not to use more than what the recipe calls for in corn syrup.

We traditionally use cocoa instead of chocolate chips, but I misplaced my recipe. I used this as a guide and used 1/3 cup cocoa, 1/3 cup Karo syrup, and 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a wafer and walnut mix. Liberal with the brandy :-) Then I rolled in powdered sugar. We keep them in the freezer and eat them frozen.

The rum balls were tasty, but I would put in less rum, as it can get a bit strong!
