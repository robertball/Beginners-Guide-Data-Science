so bland. My mom fed us this as kids 55 years. I did not like it then...it might have been  the snoke flavour so for olde times sake I thought I should give it a try...plus my wife could live on fish if I did not cook lamb, chicken, pork and beef. Anyway, it is way too bland for my tastes today and I have no idea how to 'pick it up'. To each his/her own.

Soaking the fish in the milk overnight prior to cooking is usual for finnan haddie since its a semi-dried sometimes salted smoked very mild flavor fish.  This makes a nice smoky sauce and depending on the salt level to the fish very tasty.  Be careful with adding salt.  Good recipe, reminds me of home.

Delicious. I added grated cheese to the sauce to add a little extra flaour
