I used milk instead of water to give it that creamier taste. It reminded me of the ones I used to buy in Greggs Bakery back home in England but better!

This tasted like Extra Sweet scrambled eggs...one to many eggs I think. My kids wouldnt even touch it! The only good thing is..it baked up nice...ie didnt burn. Thumbs down, what a waste.
