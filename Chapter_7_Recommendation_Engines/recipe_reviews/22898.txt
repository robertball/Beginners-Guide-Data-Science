Excellent recipe!! As an experienced cook I suggest leaving out the crushed ice, it is NOT necessary to the thickening of the cream. Also, a graham cracker crust (ready made is fine), is really yummy with this!

This came out so awesome! For those reviewers who talked about it being too thick, I only had about a cup of cream so I substituted low fat milk for the other two cups and it came out perfect! Not to mention that it was a perfect consistency and lower in calories too! Thanks for sharing.

This is excellent!  There are a couple of minor things I would change, one being to use more bananas.  I used four small ones and would use five, depending on the consistency you want.  Also, the crushed ice thing was odd to me.  I tried to beat it until it melted, but still had to pick out several pieces.  Not sure what would be the way around that.  The only other thing I may change is to add a little sugar to the top layer of whipped cream when I beat it.  It doesn't call for it, and none of the previous reviewers mentioned it, so I didn't use any.  But if you taste the top layer by itself (I pick things apart to eat them :) it of course doesn't taste very good.  All in all, a YUMMY pie that I will make again!  Thank you Angela!  Oh, by the way, I used No Roll Pie Crust II off this sight and it is so flaky and easy!

Definitely the easiest and best banana cream pie I have made.  My family insists on one a week.  I found this recipe can make two pies easily, and they can be frozen for future use.  I also recommend adding half a packet of sugar to the whip cream.  A MUST TRY!

[UPDATE 8/2008 : This recipe is foolproof. I made this recently with a pregnant friend of mine, and I left the recipe with her. I found out later she ate all of the pie and then made another one the next day! I too added some vanilla pudding mix and a bit of sugar to the whipped topping. Perfect.]

FANTASTIC! I also made a strawberry cream pie with this recipie, subing banana pudding mix with strawberry glaze to taste. BOTH pies were HUGE hits! Handed them out to boyfriend's parents, family friends, and the rest was gobbled up by mom and pop!

Best banana cream pie recipe ever.  This was much better than anything store-bought and a hundred times better than anything from a cafeteria or buffet.  The pies (I was able to make two with this recipe) were very rich and delicious, yet not too sweet.  

I didn't have any crushed ice on hand, but it made no difference as far as I could tell.  Also, the whipped cream topping tasted much better after adding some powdered sugar.  It's not necessary to pipe on the topping as I just used a spatula.  Everything tasted great together in Nilla pie crusts.

After making one with peach on the bottom my advice is to stick with the bananas!

So good! I made only one pie but mounded the filling up in the middle and I ended up putting it in a ready made shortbread crust. This is a wonderful desert to make if you don't want to spend much time on it, no time at all to mix together. I will use my homemade regular pie crust next time and actually might not whip as long as I did because it was just a smidge too stiff. I would have liked it a touch creamier - still a great pie and much better then other versions I've tried. This would also make a great filling for a summer trifle recipe with various fruits or even switching the banana mix for chocolate for a chocolate cream pie. Options!! Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome recipe and so easy to make. My family loves it. Instead of a baked pie shell, I just buy a pre-made graham cracker shell. Also, no need to use crushed ice. Just wet the inside of your mixing bowl and your metal mixers with water and then put them into the freezer for a few minutes. My family always does this when we make whipped cream. Also, if the banana mixture gets too thick, I just add some milk and stir to thin it out so it's nice and creamy.

Fabulous pie! This was the first time I've made banana cream pie, and it got rave reviews. I was told it was the best people have ever had. I followed others' suggestions, and used 5-6 bananas, banana cream pudding, and added powdered sugar and vanilla to the topping. One thing I found with the crushed ice was to put it in a blender to totally crush it. 

This is definitely in my recipe box permanently!  Thanks!!

I LOVE this recipe!!  This is my go-to recipe for a dessert in a hurry!  Bananas are readily available (and cheap) and I always keep other items on hand.  I have made this with heavy cream, half and half, and skim milk and don't have too much of a preference as to which is the best.  I tend to do half 1/2 and 1/2 and half skim milk for the topping to keep it lighter and I do skim milk for the pudding mix.  It still comes out rich and thick and yummy.  I usually use 1 vanilla and 1 banana cream pudding mix to balance the flavors.  I add extra bananas at the crust because I like it with more fruit.

This was very easy and made enough to generously fill TWO ready-made graham cracker crusts (I used one graham, one chocolate cookie crust). You do not need the ice in this recipe. In fact, I used heavy whipping cream just brought from the store (so it wasn't even all THAT cold) and it worked just fine. The creamy consistency/texture of cream pies is what makes them great. I decided the chunkiness of so many bananas detracted from the creamy texture and the pie as a whole. I will not use as many bananas next time. What bananas I do use will be sliced razor thin. You don't really even need the whipped topping part - or you could put some on each slice when you serve it. This isn't the excellent banana cream pie you'd expect from a great sweet shop -- but it fits the bill in a pinch and you can make as many different flavored pies as they make instant puddings. Couldn't be easier.

Banana cream pie was requested by one of our friends for Thanksgiving so I made this for him (prior to this I hadn't had or made banana cream pie so wasn't sure how it would turn out).  It was very quick and easy and for someone who is used to his mother's homemade banana cream pie he loved it and took the second pie home.  The only issue is the recipe as is made two 9" pies.  I used premade graham cracker pie crusts.  Great, quick, easy recipe that tastes like you've been baking all day!  Will definitely make this again!

I was craving for a banana cream pie and I found this one.  This was very easy and simple to make.  I used four bananas thinly sliced between the two pies that's all I had (next time I will add more)When I mixed the banana filling I thought it was to thick.  (I did not add the ice chips as other reviewers said it was not necessary)  I made the whip cream frosting and added a little powdered sugar.  This recipe made two 9" pies.  I used a store bought 9" deep pastry pie which come with two pies.  I put the pie fridger over night.  When we cut the pie the next day and banana filling was perfect and also the whip topping.  Taste was awesome.  I got several compliments.  I will make definitely make this again.

I made this for my sisters birthday - and it was a HUGE hit!  Her very favorite pie has always been Tippins banana cream, so i tried... and succeeded.  I have a kitchen aid mixer with the metal bowl so i just put it in the fridge to get nice and cool when i mixed it, it set up great without adding ice.  Will be a new tradition recipe, and everyone thought i slaved for hours making it :)

I made this last night for my family.  It was so great!  I skipped the ice part, you don't need to do that.  Anyway, next time I think I will use 2 vanilla puddings and no banana pudding like someone else suggested, too much of an artificial taste. But it was still delicious, my son even requested it for his birthday cake this year.

This was indeed very easy and quick to make.  I didn't add the bananas as fresh slices always seem to look so bad after the pie has been cut into.  Instead I sliced them over the top of individual pieces of pie just before serving.  I also left out the crushed ice step and it was fine.  But I gave this only two stars because it tasted like Jell-O banana pudding, only in a crust.

I really didn't think this was that flavorful.  I brought it to a party along with the French Coconut Pie and the coconut went much faster than the banana.  I won't be making it again :(

Pie was super easy to make and turned out much much better than store bought pie. I did not use the ice chips and even without ice the  pie filling turned out very thick which I loved - pie held up and was easy to slice because of how thich batter was. Yum and more yum, will definately make this again.

I made this for dessert tonight and let me tell you, My guests loved it and so did I!! I put the pie together with the "Graham Cracker Crust I" and topped it with "Easy Whipped Cream" both from this site. I only had 2 cups of heavy cream on hand so I used one for the pie with 2c of half and half. I used 4 large bananas and can't imagine using less for this pie. Also took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the crushed ice step. I don't understand what that was supposed to do. Will I make it again?? You bet your sweet bippy I will!!

Great recipe, but for my liking it was too rich, even though I love rich desserts.  Too make it creamier, I tried adding more heavy cream, but it seemed to make it thicker, so I added milk (about 1/3 - 1/2 cup).Perfect!! Great banana flavor and texture. I've made banana cream pies in the past that just don't set.  I also added about 4-5 Tbsp. powdered sugar to the 1 cup of heavy cream for a little sweetness.  Oh, and I couldn't make a decent crust to save my life, but I tried the "No Roll Pie Crust", which I found on this site. The very first time I made it, it was great. It's easy to make and very flaky. I also pricked the bottom of the shell before baking it.  Perfect!!!!!!!!!

Loved it!  Like the other suggestions, I did not use the ice. Not necessary.  I also added sugar and vanilla, to taste, to make the whipped topping.  I added bananas to the bottom and sides of the pie crust.  Delicious.  My family loved it.

This was really quick and easy! Instead of using 3 cups of whipping cream, I used 2 cups of it and then added 1 cup of milk (and I didn't use any ice). For the topping, I added 3/4 cup powdered sugar and about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the whipping cream. It was delicious!!! I'm definitely saving this recipe.

Ive been searching for a banana cream pie like this...as this is a staple for thanksgiving and xmas.  This was so good.  Only change I made was to add about 3/4 cup of powdered sugar (you will want to add it to taste) as it wasn't very sweet as is.  Also I think next time I will not do the crushed ice.

Very delicious pie! Made it for my step-dad's birthday and he absolutely loved it. Didn't use the ice and used a half a cup of milk because the filling is VERY thick! The milk makes it a little sticky.. but its easier to spread.. great recipe!

Very rich and thick. So thick that I had to add some milk to thin it out. I took the advice of others and split the filling between two pie shells and added some vanilla and sugar to the whipped topping. Next time I think I will use two cups of whipping cream and one cup of milk to keep the banana cream from being so thick.

I didn't use the ice and whipped the cream too much before adding the pudding so I added in the extra cup of cream and it came out wonderfully!  I think I will make it this way from now on.

The best cream pie on the site.   I used a ready-made chocolate crust and drizzled hershey's surup on top.  Everyone loved it.   I too would not whip it so long as it gets really thick quick once the pudding mix is put into cream.

This recipe turned out great! It easily made two 9 inch pies - which was fortunate because it was so good, no one could eat just one slice! I did modify the crust (banana cream pie belongs in a graham cracker crust!) and omit the extra whipped cream on top. Instead, when it came time to serve it, I topped it with the canned extra creamy whipped topping. I also crushed the ice in the blender before adding it and this worked perfect. Be sure to have about 5 medium sized bananas on hand - three wasn't enough. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe and used banana creme pudding instead of regular banana pudding (but that was only because the store didnt have the regular) and drizzled caramel sauce on top, and it was AMAZING! My husband wants me to try it next time in a graham cracker pie crust, however, I don't think there is much improving on this one. It's really great.

This recipe was amazing!  The only thing I changed was the crust.  We aren't huge fans of regular pie crusts so I used a graham cracker recipe instead!  Perfection is all I have to say!  The banana pieces gave it just the perfect taste!  There was enough for two pies!  They were gone before the night was over and there were only 5 of us!!!!!

Admittedly, I did not leave enough time to chill and skipped the crushed ice, but this pie came out smooth and creamy and second helpings were knicked when my back was turned. Also, I used 1/2 a package of vanilla pudding and only one pint of heavy cream. I used a canned heavy whipped cream on top since I have yet to add a pastry bag to my cooking arsenal. Instead of a baked pie shell, I used a ready made graham cracker crust (though vanilla wafers do well in a pinch. This shaved more than an hour off the time from prep to table. Three yums UP!

This pie was fantatsic! I did how ever change a few things based upon other reviews. Skip the crushed ice, the cold cream does the trick. I used a store bough graham cracker crust to save on time. Instead of lining the pan with the bananas, I folded the slived bananas into the cream. This way you get a bite of banana every time! My family LOVES this recipe!

This is a great recipe!  However, the ice thing is absolutely  not necessary!  Also, I just used all vanilla pudding.  The banana has a really artificial flavor and it just isn't necessary either.  But it you like banana pudding, go for it!  I just prefer the regular vanilla throughout! Yum! Everyone loved it when I made it!

This was really good. The only modification I made was with the topping.  I left about a cup of the pudding mixture aside and for the top mixed that with a half cup of whipped cream.  Topped with sliced bananas.  Yum!

This recipe is so incredibly easy and tasty! I followed the advice of others and used 1 cup of milk for the filling and did not bother with the ice. I also added a little vanilla and sugar to the topping for taste. It takes no time at all to make and is now something that I am required to bring at every holiday gathering (and then some). My friends and family cannot get enough of it!

Every Banana Cream Pie I have made in the past turned out runny. I loved the thick creamy consistency of this pie. I used a traditional pie crust. I assumed the "heavy cream" stated in the recipe meant whipping cream. So easy to make and my family loved it. Oh, and I skipped the whole ice thing too... not sure why that is in the recipe.

i have made this pie MANY times now, and everyone just LOVES it. it's so delicious!!! i've made a few variants... i don't use the ice and i always use LOTS more bananas than the recipe calls for. it can make two regular pies, or one really heaping pie with some leftover filling. I also find that the longer this pie sits in the fridge, the better it gets. it's PERFECT on the third day for breakfast with a cup of black coffee. Everyone LOVES this pie!!! thanks for the successful recipe!

Just made this and will not make this again.  The texture is strange and does not have a strong enough banana flavor.   Like others, I found it to be too thick.  I ended up adding about a cup of milk at the end to thin out the filling.  I haven't tried the finished product but thought I'd write my review now.

This was great! Very easy and quick. instead of using all heavy cream, I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk. I left out the ice. I just made sure the cream and milk were very cold. The mixture thickens very fast. The pie holds it shape very well and does not separate after 24 hours like the cook and serve pie fillings. Like I said this is a great recipe. My husband loved it and so did I.(I do not like banana cream pie.) I will be making this again and again. Thanks.

A little thicker than most pies, but very tasty! I, like other reviewers, added sugar and vanilla to the whipped topping

I made this for my Dad on Father's Day and he loved it.  I didn't add the crushed ice - and it didn't seem to make a difference.  I added sugar to the whipping cream for the top layer which is good, but I think next time I'll use Cool Whip for the topping.

I made this pie for Easter and it was very good.  I am not sure I whipped the cream long enough after reading some of the other reviews, but I will make it again because it tasted soooo good.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I don't usually like banana cream pies but this one was soooo good!  I ended up making 2 pies because it makes so much filling. I used the "Nilla" pie shells and 5 or 6 bananas. The whipped cream isn't enough for both pies so if you are going to make 2 pies from this recipe you may want to double the whipping cream.  I added a little powdered sugar and vanilla extract to my whipping cream to sweeten it up.  My pies came out thicker in texture than banana cream pies we've tried before.  I don't know if it's the recipe or if I whipped the mixture too long.  Either way...it tasted great!

I'm not much of a cook (to give you an idea, this was the first time I used the whip attachment on my Kitchen Aid mixer) and this recipe was just as easy and wonderful as advertised!  The filling overfilled my 9.5 inch pie plate, so I omitted the extra cream for the top, but I guess you could serve it on the side.  I also used an extra banana.  Had no problem getting volunteers to clean the bowl for me...it was delicious!

I made this pie for my mother in law for mother's day- and "Wow!". I couldn't believe how easy this was to make- and how delicious. The pudding layer alone was wonderful- I could eat that by the spoonful. I took leftovers to work- and it was gone in less than 5 minutes.

This was wonderful.  There were no leftovers when I made it for a party.  I am making it again for Easter.  The one thing I did differently, I used the ready made gram cracker crust.  It was really good!  I would highly recommend this recipe to you and your family.

I made this for a friend for her birthday and she raved about it.  I also used a shortbread crust and it really enhanced the flavor.  Will be making this again.  Thank you very much for posting this wonderful recipe.

I think this was the best banana cream pie I have ever made or ate.  Just remember not to over do it when it tells you to turn mixer on high because it thickens really fast!  It was delicious!  My neighbors asked for the recipe the next day!

This is the simplest banana cream pie recipe I have ever tried.  Family and friends absolutely love it!  For those people who are familiar with Max & Erma restaurants ... the pie is comparable to their's (if not better)!

This was the perfect pie!  I was afraid that it might be too much work, but it was really very simple and the results were wonderful!  The whipped cream gave it such a light and airy taste.  I will make again and again!

Great Recipe!  This was my first time making any kind of pie.  I used a frozen pie crust, which make it even easier.  I even took vanilla wafers, put them in the bottom of muffin tins, and then put this filling over the top.  I will definatley use this recipe over and over

My 1st banana cream pie recipe that I have made. It was very good but I had to remove unmelted ice from the mixture, just to make sure no one bit into ice. Very easy to make though!

Great 2 ingredient recipe, but I used 1 cup of whole milk at the end instead of the 1/2 cup crushed ice at the beginning and the filling turned out perfect. I also used 2 boxes of instant Banana pudding for more flavor. Second time making this recipe I switched it by using a 9x9 glass pan, crushed Nilla Wafers and melted butter for crust, instant Lemon pudding and fresh sliced Strawberries between layers and garnish. I posted both photos. #ITSAKEEPER

This was delicious and creamy! In my personal opinion start out at a faster speed when beating it. I was beating it for like ten minutes on low speed and nothing was hardly happening. But all in all it was yummy!

This was an easy and delicious pie recipe. I didn't use the ice in it though as suggested by other reviewers. I did find the filling to be a wee bit too thick but that's really my only complaint.

This pie is so easy to make and tastes great. My husband loves it. Its not a health conscious recipe but a great treat now and then. I did use the ice. The amount of filling could make two somewhat level pies but I heaped it all in one and made a mountain:-).

So easy, quick and tasty!  I used both Jello's instant banana cream pudding and (new to me) "Simply Good Vanilla Bean" instant pudding mixes in a graham cracker crust and gone grown bananas.

Made this for my son-in-law for Fathers' Day. He loves banana cream pie. It was a hit. I followed the recipe and didn't change anything. I will make this again.

This pie turned out really well!   Directions were simple and very easy to follow!    Not all of the crushed ice melted so I removed them.    I will be making this one again!    Yummy, light flavor, not overpowering.

Simple recipe. I omit the crushed ice, add a tsp of vanilla and an extra banana.  Everyone loves this recipe! We very rarely have desert but if we do it's usually this. We are just bananas over it :)

The best banana pie ever!Personally, I don't eat banana anything other than the fruit by itself, but I made this super simple pie for my brother. There was some filling that wouldn't fit in the pie crust so I gave it a try and WOW I actually liked it and even had a piece myself. I made my own whipped cream for the topping and it was fabulous! This recipe is now a favorite because it's simple, delicious and a pie can be whipped up in about 30 minutes so it's great for the inexperienced pie maker or anyone short on time.

I made this for a holiday last year. We usually have 8-9 people at our get togethers and a typical pie is usually cut into 10 or 12 pieces, and not everyone takes a piece...

This was GONE, and I'm pretty sure my nephew was licking his plate. When talking about Thanksgiving and pies I mentioned this one and everyone raved about it. And it's SUPER EASY!!!

Super easy and super delicious! Got raves from anyone that tried it! I myself think it's absolutely amazing, especially for being so simple!! Everyone asks me to make them over and over again lol. I left out the crushed ice part and added lots more sugar to the whipped cream cuz the whipped cream doesn't taste like anything. Prepare to have your pie gobbled up!!!

Everyone loved this recipe. I also didn't add any crushed ice-thickened up just fine without it. Next time I will try with a graham cracker crust, even though a traditional pie crust tasted great.

Very easy and delicious!  I didn't have enough heavy cream so I used 1 1/2 cups heavy cream adn 1 1/2 cups milk.  I skipped the crushed ice step and I had a pie that was easy and delicious!

LOVE this recipe! It was so easy to make but so good, got many raves! I did what other users suggested and kept the crushed ice out. I also used a ready-made graham cracker pie crust that I bought from the grocery store! I bought two and I certainly needed it, this recipe makes enough for two pies! The only thing I would change is maybe using canned whipped cream because I think it would remain nice and fluffy longer if refrigerated! But if you make this for others I guess it wouldn't be a problem since it will go fast! ( I craved it so much one day I made one just for myself lol) The boyfriend even told me he wanted to start buying pies off me LoL! Awesome recipe, can't go wrong!!

I skipped the crushed ice thing, substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for skim milk, put a tablespoon of sugar in the topping and did 2 boxes of banana pudding instead of 1 vanilla 1 banana.  I suggest putting a double layer of bananas on the bottom.  I think I will try 1 vanilla 1 banana next time.  Banana flavor was pretty strong this way but still way good! Pie turned out perfect!  Husband ate two huge slices!  Definite keeper!

Great recipe; quick and easy!! I made a few minor changes. First, my family loves bananas, so I added more banana pudding mix than vanilla. Filling was a little thick, so I added some milk. Lastly, I used an already prepared graham cracker crust instead of regular pie crust. Makes a lot of filling, so I would suggest 2 pies or 1 big pie!!

After reading the rave reviews for this recipe, I was looking forward to a tasty treat. I was disappointed. It's just an expensive and time-consuming way to make banana pudding. I'll continue to look for a good banana cream pie recipe. This one isn't it.

I liked that it was light and not over sweet, but it could have used a bit more banana flavor, I think the next time instead of one pack banana pudding and one vanilla, I will use two packs of banana pudding.  
Otherwise even my banana hating fiance didnt mind eating this pie!

This certainly is an easy pie that looks pretty. It was just too thick for our tastes. If any isn't eaten the first day, it gains a rubbery consistency the next day.

This was my 1st attempt at baking this dessert. It was just ok. I thought it was way too soupy and the pudding in it tasted a little gritty to me.. I will be on the hunt for a better recipe. I am looking for more of a pudding texture and this just wasnt it.

This pie was very good. I omited the ice and used sugar free pudding. It turned out a little thick, but it made a taller pie. I used a grahm cracker crust also. I would make this again. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

Ok, so it's not like a banana cream pie that you'd get at a pie restaurant...but it IS a step above the ones made with cool whip!  My kids like this recipe over a traditional banana cream pie.  I think they like the fluffyness over the creamyness of the other.

A delicious, easy to make banana pie!  For all of my nieces and nephews who don't like bananas all that much, I only layered the bottom of the pie with sliced bananas.  They ate the rest of it up!  I used a premade shortbread crust that accompanied the filling well.
