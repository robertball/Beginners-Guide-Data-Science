This was amazing and so simple to make. I used a large can 29oz of 
canned pumpkin and everything else the same as the recipe. I carved the pumpkin and everyone liked it best with Honey Maid cinnamon graham sticks and granny apples. Recipe for pumpkin pie spice:1/2t cinnamon,1/4t ground ginger,1/8t ground nutmeg,1/8t ground cloves or allspice and blend.

This is a great low fat dip that I have been making for years.  I use fat free/sugar free pudding and lite Cool Whip.  I have even put it between 2 graham crackers and into the freezer.  Like a pumpkin ice cream sandwich!

I agree with the previous reviews . . . this recipe is simple, delicious and unique.  Looked nice with a dusting of fresh, ground nutmeg and a scattering of ginger-snaps & vanilla wafers as dippers.  (Best refrigerated overnight.)  The second time making the recipe, I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and a tablespoon of Butterscotch Schnapps for a little added interest.  It certainly got peoples attention . . .right down to the bottom of the bowl! Tiera, Thanks for a wonderful, crowd-pleasing recipe!

This recipe was a big hit at my potluck.  My only comment is to carefully read the required package sizes of the ingredients.  I originally bought a standard sized tub of whipped topping which is only 8oz.  After mixing it, it appeared very thick and pumpkiny.  That's when I realized I needed another tub for the required 16oz. (note also that the pudding package is 5oz, not the standard 3oz). After reading some of the other reviews, I suspect that I am not the only person to do this.  When the proper amounts were used, it turned out great.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this for a fall harvest party.  Everyone loved it.  I served it with homemade ginger snaps and apple slices.  Everyone, from my 2-year old nephew to my great grandmother loved this dip.  I had to make copies of this recipe for everyone to take home with them as they left the party

This recipe is very good but I would suggest using the larger pumpkin (29 oz) and 2 pudding mixes.  Also stir the pumpkin and cool whip first then add the pudding and spices.  When I added the pudding first it got thick too fast and didn't stir correctly.  When I made the changes, the recipe was definately a 5!!!  Everyone requests it and my family loves to dip ginger snaps in it!

I found this very easy, but we did not like it. I won't make this again. I do suggest that 
everyone interested in the recipe try it though because it is that easy. I think the texture is 
what turned us off the most.

I served this dip in a small hollowed out pumpkin surrounded by cinnamon graham crackers.  It looked very festive!  My guests loved it.

This was really pedestrian in taste, very "eh - so what" in flavor. Maybe I have officially become a food snob but after the first bite I knew I'd never make this again. I subscribe to and cook from magazines like Cook's Country and Cook's Illustrated and I love The Barefoot Contessa etc. If you cook at this level too, or even just appreciate food from such a level, then skip this recipe; it's going to disappoint you without question. Sorry to be so critical but I wish I'd seen a review like mine before trying and I never would have been disappointed.

Delicious dip!!!  I took this into work and it was a huge hit.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  I found that I like it better with only 1/2 the whipped topping and I also added 8 oz. softened cream cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is definitely a "keeper."

this recipe is really flexible, which is why i love it. i made this for a halloween office party. i altered the ingredients as follows:   6 oz. softened cream cheese (i found pumpkin spice flavor), 29 oz. can of pumpkin, 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 5 oz. sugar free vanilla pudding, 8oz. thawed fat free cool whip. i served the dip in a FROZEN hollowed out pumpkin with ginger snaps, vanilla wafers and cinnamon graham crackers (in order of popularity). the pumpkin was cleaned out and i had tons of recipe requests. had a treat for myself when i got home, a frozen gingersnap pumpkin spice "ice cream" sandwich! much better than graham crackers, which tend to get soggy for me. the gingersnap still had some crispness to it. YUM.   thanks for this one!

I've made this a couple times now. This time I used about 4 oz. Cool Whip, and I used the no fat kind. I also used sugar-free vanilla pudding. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and served it with vanilla wafer cookies.

In order to get a true pumpkin pie taste (and not a cool whip taste), you need to decrease the whipped topping to an 8 oz. container OR increase the pumpkin to the 29 oz can. But once you do this, you will be dreaming of pumpkin pie because it's so good! And if your grocer runs out of the plain pumpkin can, just use the one that already has the spices included, and omit the pumpkin pie spice from the recipe.

Needed a last moment dish to take to a ladies get together. With time constraints wanted to use only ingredients I had on hand. Having all the necessary ingredients "Except" only 1 8 oz container of cool whip.  I decided to add the other 8 oz. using softened cream cheese.

I had already used a hand mixer to blend together the pumpkin, spices, and vanilla pudding mix. I mashed the cream cheese with a fork in a separate bowl to smooth & soften the block of cream cheese. Then used the mixer to blend in the cream cheese.

Lastly added in the chilled Cool Whip by blending/folding it in with a spatula or large spoon.

Had not tasted the original recipe, but have to say this version was a hit with the gals. Nearly evryone wanted to know the recipe and when I offered to share the amt. that was left after our meal was done, I think I took home about a 1/2 cup.

The ladies said they liked the cream cheese in it and perhaps it made the difference so the pumpkin was not overpowering the dip.

SO yummy! I could just eat the whole thing on my own lol

Sometimes I'll just get lazy and buy Libby's easy pumpkin mix, the one that already has the spices in it, just as good imo. 

Last time I made this I baked a pumpkin pie and when it was done cooling, topped it off with the Pumpkin Fluff Dip. Yum. Give it a try!

I hate to rate any recipe low but I think to like this dip you HAVE to love cold pumpkin!  My family apparently doesn't.  I made this for my family get-together at Thanksgiving and only one person liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly and then chilled it overnight to blend the flavors.  Just for looks, I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top.  I served it with regular Graham crackers, Cinnamon Graham crackers, and apple slices.  As someone else mentioned, this make a lot of dip!  I would suggest if you have any doubts at all, half the recipe the first time you make it.  Otherwise, you will have a lot to throw out.  Thanks for sharing but this is not for us.

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. My husband told me I don't have to make pumpkin pie any more for Thanksgiving, just this dip! I did add more spice; I think it was one half teaspoon extra pumpkin pie spice and one teaspoon of cinnamon. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think that the pumpkin flavor was over powered by the Cool Whip and pudding, but maybe that is a matter of taste. I thought that it was just enough pumpkin flavor, not too strong. To those who complained about the texture, I think that improves after refrigeration. So if you liked the taste but not the texture and you ate it right after mixing, try making it ahead and keeping it in the fridge. I served it with vanilla wafers and honey graham cracker sticks for dipping, most people preferred the graham sticks.

A great recipe for Fall Harvest/ Halloween parties.  I served the fluff-filled pumpkin on a large decorative plate with various kinds of apple wedges for dipping.(To prevent apples from browning:In a big ziploc bag, add sliced apple wedges and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice then give a shake)
 It makes a pretty presentation. Thanks for sharing.

This is good.  The first time I made it I liked it, but thought a bit too much whipped topping.  The second time I used 8 oz. instead of 16 oz. of whipped topping, took it to a family fall outing and they loved it.  It's still fluffy, but the flavor is much better with less whipped topping.

VERY good!  I didn't use a full container of cool whip (maybe 3/4 of a container) and used 1.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice to give it a kick. Used a small box instant vanilla pudding mix (sugar free/fat free) because there is no 5 oz box that I can think of (even the huge one is only 1.5 oz so this must be a typo). Used fat free Cool Whip and it's not bad for you at ALL!  YUM!  Very good with granny smith apples. :)  Super easy; will make this over and over now!

Unbelievably easy, unbelievably delicious! I used most of a 500mL container of whipped partially sweetened whipping cream and store bought cinnamon snap cookies (Dare brand) and it was perfect! I have also made this dip with mashed sweet potatoe and it was fabulous!

This recipe was very easy, and I have a 5 year old with a very picky choice of diet.  This was one of her favorites, but she likes to eat it plain like pudding..Me personally, I enjoy it by making it the filling in a sandwich of cinnamon Grams

The first time I made this for Thanksgiving, I used only 1 small package of sugar free vanilla pudding and 1 8 oz container of Cool Whip. I really thought it was kind of bland, so the second time I used 1 8 oz Cool Whip, 1 small package of sugar free pudding, 2 15 oz cans of pumpkin, 1 tbsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice. I thought the taste was much better and had more pumpkin flavor to it. We really enjoyed it the second time. I will make it again using the more pumpkin recipe.

This was absolutely delish!  It was so simple too!  I tried it with gingersnaps, which I didn't particularly care for, so I tried cinnamon graham crackers.  Much better!  I will definitely make this again!

I couldn't find a 16 oz. container of Cool Whip, only an 8 oz. container, so I just used one of those and it seemed to work just fine. No complaints from anyone who ate it. I served it with Pepperidge Farms Ginger Man cookies--though my husband thinks it's great with a spoon. I think it tastes like pumpkin cake batter.

This recipe was GREAT. I submitted it to a Dip party last night and won. :) I followed the recipe as shown, but added about 4 oz of store bought WHIPPED cream cheese, and only used ONE 8 oz container of Cool Whip. I wanted to keep the pumpkin-ey flavor. I also added a TB of cinnamon in addition to the pumpkin pie spice. I put everything in my Vitamix blender and it mixed just fine (and was super easy) then put it in the fridge to firm up for about 3 hours. I then lined a pumpkin with saran wrap and scooped it in. Served with apple slices, gingersnaps and cinnamon graham crackers. SO GOOD. People hovered around it ALL NIGHT until it was gone.

Great stuff! I made this for my halloween party and served it in a pumpkin bowl with graham crackers ("coffin planks") and it was a huge hit! I highly recommend adding a tiny bit more spice as it really makes the dish.

This was really good! I used Koolwhip Free, and cheesecake pudding mix ... going to take it to work and share the yumminess! I'll serve with sliced honeycrisp apples, Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread cubes, and Anna's Ginger Thins ... and I just found an AR recipe for these cookies, called "Traditional Swedish Pepparkakor" that I can't wait to try! Thanks for this great recipe! ♥

I work at a GM plant in Ohio, and brought this in and passed it around for Halloween with Nilla Wafers.  At least 20 people tried it, and everyone LOVED it!  I am passing out requested copies of the recipe this afternoon!  Thanks!

Nice and light and like everyone else already said different than the norm!  Yumm! And must agree with others it is best on cinnamon graham crackers.  Also have some almond cookies to try it with.

A HUGE hit for carry-ins. I fixed it for my husband to take to work last Fall & this year they specifically asked that he bring it in again. I must've sent the recipe to a dozen people that requested it. It's SUPER easy, really tasty, and a nice touch during the Fall season. I served it with Vanilla wafers and Gingersnaps. If you want to lighten it a bit, use fatfree Cool Whip & sugarfree pudding.

THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD!!!  Absolutely everyone raved about this....I served with cinnamon graham crackers, gingersnaps (my favorite), as well as apple wedges (straight from the orchard).  This does make a HUGE amount -- my party only had 6 people so I have LOTS left.  This would be good for a large crowd -- perfect for fall parties.

Really tasty and addicting! I served this with ginger crisps and it was DELICIOUS! I also liked it with graham crackers, but the ginger crisps made it all that much better. I took this to a staff get together and everyone wanted the recipe. It was so easy, I just rattled it off!  You really need to try this! Oh, and another bonus is that you can use sugar free pudding and fat free whipped topping to reduce the calories and the pumpkin is packed with nutrition and fiber... so it is *almost* health food! Hahaha!

This is wonderful.  I made it as the dip at Thanksgiving.  Everyone LOVED IT.  I knew it was a keeper when I saw my granddaughter putting it on top of her Pumpkin Pie as a topping.  A few weeks later we had a bring a dish at work and I made this, but put it in graham cracker crust. It was a hit.

I haven't made this (yet) but have eaten it every year at work! There's a woman who makes it there--but she uses cheesecake flavored pudding mix. It's out of this world! I'll have to try it with vanilla pudding next time.

Very quick and easy, and very good!  I am not a huge fan of pumpkin, but I really did like this dip and I will definitely make it again.  I got several compliments on it.  I had to use two 3.4 oz. packs of pudding because I didn't have a 5 oz.  I also used light cool whip.  I served it with cinnamon graham crackers; I wanted to use cinnastix, but I couldn't find them.  I had a good bit left over (I do not think because of the dip, but because there was a ton of other food) and I decided to make a pie from what was left and take it to a church function today.  I spread it into a graham cracker pie crust, spread cool whip over it, and sprinkled some cinnamon on top for garnish and froze it.  Someone hunted me up just to tell me that it was the best pumpkin pie she's ever had!  Wow!  That made my day!  If I do the pie again, I may mix some cream cheese into the cool whip before spreading it over the pumpkin dip.

Turned out really good and I got loads of compliments on it.  I added a little bit of vanilla extract to bring out the flavor and paired the dip with cinnamon graham crackers as suggested. Tasty!

As a suggestion from a previous reviewer I served this with the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread and it was a big hit!  I cut the pumpkin bread in big chunks instead of slices so it could be easily picked up.  It is not too sweet and just perfect with the pumpkin bread.  It looked beautiful on a platter with the fluff in the bowl in the center surrounded by the pumpkin bread.  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!

Big hit at Bunko.  I used lite whipped topping & sugar-free pudding -- still fabulous.   Would be great as a pastry filling, like another review suggested.

This was okay, but I think that it was a little too plain. It just tasted like pumpkin flavored whipped cream. I even used the cinnamon graham craclers like suggested. If you really want to make this recipe, maybe try it on warm banana bread.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this for a party and everyone loved it, even those who didn't like pumpkin.  I served it with ginger snaps, apple slices, and graham crackers.  The tart apples were perfect for the sweet dip.  The ginger snaps were also very popular.  I will certainly make this again and again!

This was so delicious and a hit at the party I took it took.  I don't like pumpkin pie but love this.  Everyone asked for the recipe and was amazed how easy it was to make.  I definately recommend it for the holidays.  I am making it for Thanksgiving.

Mmmm. mmmm. mmmm.  This stuff was awesome.  I gotta tell ya, I was worried that it would like orange or even worse, brownish moosh.  It was actually a very pale orange color and nice and fluffy.  It really set up well thanks to the pudding.  My only "complaint" is that it made a LOT (and that's an understatement).  Unless you have a very, very large crowd I'd suggest cutting this in half.  Otherwise it's awesome!

Very nice twist on the standard dip fare. Added a small amount of whipped cream with pumpkin spice to the top for decoration. Served inside a hallowed out pumpkin with cinnamon graham crackers, vanilla wafers and ginger snaps.  This went over very big at my son's preschool Halloween event.

There's really not much to report on this recipe.  I followed it exactly as stated & let sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to party time.  It was simple to make, the lesser of evils on the table (I used light whipped topping) & tasted great.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

This was a great recipe and a cute idea.  We had a baby shower for my sister-in-law with a fall theme.  We made this and served it with teddy grahams and animal crackers.  Everyone raved over this and there were no leftovers.  I will make this one again.

Yummy + easy = winner! Very light, not filling, just enough sweetness and pumpkin flavor to be just right. Nothing much for me to add that hasn't already been said. Keeper.

Great dip and super easy. I used fat free and sugar free where I could, and no one noticed. I also made two batches, one adding 2T of Butterscotch Schnapps. It made the dip amazing! I found cinnamon almond cookie thins at the store, so I put the dip between two and froze them to make mini, guilt free "ice cream" sandwiches.

Heavenly, light, not too sweet, great pumpkin-y flavor but not overpowering. I will use it as a pie filling with a cinnamon graham cracker crust and layered in a cake, too. Hmmm, the ideas are flowing !

This dip is so easy to make! I usually make a double batch whenever I make it, it gets eaten up super fast! I add a little more cinnamon after I mix in the pumpkin spice. Love it with nilla wafers or graham crackers!

This was really good and very easy to whip up.  I can keep the ingredients on hand for when the kids need a quick snack or I need something to take.  I served with Nilla wafers and they were great.  Tasted like pumpkin pie.

I did not follow the recipe after reading the reviews, I decided to use all the same ingredients but reduced the pumpkin by A LOT. Instead I used about 3 tables spoons of Pumpkin Puree. It was good and my 3 year old LOVED it. This is a good start to some fun and easy desserts and accompanyments for a party. I think I may use this idea and omitt the pumpkin and add pear baby food to create a fun fruit dip for the summer.

Simple and yummy! I made this with my 2 year old daughter and we had it with cinnamon graham crackers. I used fat free cool whip and vanilla pudding mix like the recipe says but I think other flavors would be really good as well, like maybe butterscotch. Very inexpensive to make, so that is always a plus. We loved it, thank you for sharing!   I think this would also be a very good frosting for a spice cake, even good on cheesecake or to spead on pumkin bread.

I made this for my Bible study group. It went over VERY well.  I served it with apple slices, ginger snaps and cinnamon graham sticks. I used cheesecake and vanilla pudding, and added my own spices- cinnamon, ginger, fresh grated nutmeg and a little allspice. I think next time I make it, though, I'll add a little more pumpkin. It really tasted like pumpkin pie in a dip. The kids LOVED it.

I used about half the whipped cream called for and kept everything else the same. I can't imagine being able to taste the pumpkin with all that Cool Whip! Still came out light and fluffy. As another reviewer suggested, I used graham cracker sticks, granny smith apples, and homemade ginger-molasses cookies for dippers. Made it for a Halloween party and everyone loved it! This recipe really makes a lot!

YUM! Everyone who has tried this has given it rave reviews.  To try to make it a little healthier, I made my own whipped cream (without sugar) using whipping cream.  There is plenty of sugar in the pudding to make this dip nice and sweet!

Ultimate in goodness and ease! This is my second year making this. I saw someone said it was ugly. Noooo...it is so beautiful in a perfectly round carved out pie pumpkin, and sprinkle it with dark chocolate shavings...Wow! It's also flexible...use a little more or less of whatever suits you, and use cheesecake pudding, vanilla, white chocolate..whatever suits your fancy. I served with Ginger Snaps, Honey Gram Teddy Bears (for kids), windmill cookies, and regular Grahm crackers. Inexpensive, easy and quick to assemble either ahead of time or right before a party.

This was a big hit especially with the pumpkin as the bowl! Great seasonal appetizer. The consistency of this dip is like a mouse and you definitely need the sweeter cookies (like graham cracker sticks) Also, I mixed the pumpkin and vanilla pudding powder together and then added the cool whip and added the pumpkin spice. I increased the spice 1/4 tsp more. I just felt I couldn't taste it at first. I don't know if it really needed it. It was great over all and super easy!

This recipe is amazing!!!! We dipped granny smith apple slices in it and it was soooo good!!!!! It does make quite a bit though.  I cut it in half and it still made enough for the whole week!

I happened on this recipe several years ago when I was looking for a way to prepare somehing with pumpkin for my preschool class to taste that they might actually enjoy. They liked it so much that I have had them make it for our Thanksgiving feast every year since. It's great because they can totally do it themselves. As some other reviewers suggested I double the pumpkin and use 2 small pudding boxes instead of 1 large. Everyone loves it. I love the pumpkin serving bowl pictured here now. Can't wait to try that next week.

I thought this was too much like pumpkin-flavored cool whip. I don't think it had enough substance to stand on it's own so to speak.  I added an 8 oz. package of cream cheese to the leftover portion I had and it was great like that.

Everyone loved this recipe.  Served it with gingersnaps, and it was the first thing gone.  Like other reviewers I used 8oz of cool whip not 16oz, and it was perfect.  Thanks for this yummy treat.

This is quick to make and tastes great!  I used a 12oz container of Cool Whip instead of the 16oz and I'm glad I did... I might even add a little extra pumpkin next time.  I forgot the pumpkin pie spice when I went shopping, so I used 1/2 tsp allspice 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg and 1/4 tst cinnamon and it worked out just fine.

This is excellent and very easy to make.  I put the filling in small phyllo tart shells and they were devoured.  I've also used it in small meragine shells and it was good.  Made a small pie with graham cracker crust and froze it.  I will cut back on the size the next time.  Wonderful!!

I thought the flavor was very nice....definitely VERY easy. I wish I had read the reviews, I probably would have made it with the small container of cool whip. I'm not sure about these people adding so much extra seasoning...It is subtle, not bland. Very nice and light.  I served it with the graham cracker fingers.

I took this into work for Boss's Day along with some Graham Cracker Sticks and other Graham snacks - everyone loved it!  We all agreed it would taste good with some fresh fruit too.  I even made it with the generic whipped topping and pudding and it still was delightful - no one could pass by the desk without taking some!  Thanks for a great recipe - I plan on serving it at our anniversary party too!

Quickly becoming a favorite! Yes, as others have said, watch your ingredient sizes (5 oz pudding). I made it with long-necked squash roasted in the oven then run thru the blender. I used low fat whipped topping and sugar free pudding for a reduced calorie recipe. Also tried butterscotch pudding which was a hit.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. However, I took it to a small gathering where I knew there would be people with gluten, dairy, and nut allergies - which limited my options significantly. Looking for an easy recipe that met this criteria, I served it with apple wedges, cinnamon graham crackers, and ginger snaps, and it seemed to be enjoyed quite a bit. We didn't manage to finish the leftovers, so it wasn't irresistible, but it worked well for my purpose!

I agree with the other reviewers that suggested cutting down on the cool whip. I used one large can (29oz.) of pure pumpkin, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 5 oz. box of vanilla pudding mix and only 1 8oz tub of the cool whip. So yummy!!! I could eat it by the spoonful- but it is just as good with graham crackers (I use the scooby doo graham crackers- they are shaped by little dog bones. So much fun for the kiddies!!)

I had bought a can of pumpkin for my baby and when I got it home and opened it I had accidentally bought pumpkin pie filling... so I hopped on allrecipes to see what I could do with it.... this dip seemed like a great idea....I used the already sweetened and seasoned pumpkin, a pack of french vanilla pudding mix and a tub of cool whip.......WOW! my husband can't stay out of it!! He even asked me to make it for him to take in to work.... It's very light and fluffy... I highly recommend using the filling instead of the plain pumpkin!!

My family loved this recipe.  I followed recipe exactly but made half the portion, as it was plenty to fit in a small pumpkin shell.  Read the container sizes carefully as the cool whip calls for an extra large container size.

Love this recipe, but don't use FAT FREE Cool Whip.  Too runny.

This is so yummy! I am not a pumpkin fan, but this fluff is perfect! I served the dip at a pumpkin carving party and several people asked for the recipe!

This recipe is all you would expect from a pumpkin dip in flavor and texture.  This could also be served as a pumpkin mousse.

I make this sugar free using Whey-Low sugar substitute and fat-free, sugar-free pudding mix.  It's great with Pizzelle's, frozen and eaten as an "ice cream" sandwich!

This was just okay.  I may have not done something right but it was really easy to follow.  I thought it didn't have enough of a pumpkin taste and tasted too much whipped cream.  Doubt if I'll try again, but it was worth a try!

Took this to a work party. WHAT A HIT!!!!!!!  I changed the recipe a little for my second batch and that was a bigger hit. I used the large can of pumkin, added an extra 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and used two three ounce boxes of pudding mix. Thanks for a great recipe

This pumkin dip is so good an is so easy to make.  It was a huge hit with kids adults alike.  We served it at the Halloween party we had.  It makes a lot as you can tell from the ingredients.  I served it with regular graham crackers and sliced apples.  Although I haven' yet, I bet this would freeze well.  Why not, you can purchase both cool whip and pumpkin pie frozen. I used regular cool whip, so I can't vouch for how this dip would work with lite.

I did not like this at all. It tasted like pumpkin flavored whipped cream. I added an extra pack of pumpkin pudding mix and still it seemed strange. I would make this with half the amount of whipped cream and some cream cheese next time.

This is pretty good stuff! I'm not a huge fan of Cool Whip, as I find it has a very artificial flavor and greasy texture, but I used 1 8oz tub of the sugar free Cool Whip, and subbed an 8oz brick of fat free cream cheese that I softened and whipped before adding the 2 small packages of fat-free/sugar-free pudding mix. I used the cheesecake flavor, but I think next time I will use at least 1 package of vanilla flavor instead. It really needed that warm undercurrent of vanilla flavor to balance it out.    I don't like the pre-made pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, clove and a little sprinkle of allspice from the jar then added freshly grated nutmeg and used a microplane to add some fresh ginger for some zing. Spices turned out really well! I just did it to taste.  This is FANTASTIC served with crispy gingersnaps and honey crisp apples.  There wasn't a whole lot left after our little event with only 6 people!

My friend gave me the receipt but I tweaked it in the following way to give it some more substance/protein: 1 (8 oz) fat free whipped topping 2 (3.4 oz) pumpkin seasonal pudding mix 15 oz solid pk pumpkin pie spice but I also add 1 (8 oz) block of fat free cream cheese. It firms it up. I serve with gingersnaps, cinnamon graham crackers, and red & green apple slices.  I make it for my son's class room and every party the kids and teacher request it from me!

I made this recipe for one of my desserts for Thanksgiving Day, and followed these comments from other reviewers: Use lg can pumpkin (29 0z). Nice w/dusting of fresh, ground nutmeg and a scattering of granny smith apples, ginger-snaps, cinnamon graham cracker, and nilla wafers as dippers. Best refrigerated overnight to 1 1/2 days ahead. Can also add a tsp of pure vanilla extract and a tablespoon of Butterscotch Schnapps for added interest.  I didn't add the Schnapps, but I followed all the other suggestions.  I served the dip, topped with freshly grated nutmeg along with cinnamon graham crackers, gingersnaps, nilla wafers, and apple slices.  This recipe makes a LOT!!  Everyone raved about it, and it was popular with the adults as well as the kids.  Definitely a keeper!

This was good everybody liked it but as for me i feel it is missing something.. maybe cream cheese. Next time i will be more "health concious" and get sugar free-cool whip, sugar free pudding for a much healthier snack to dip in apples.

I had to give this 4 stars.  While I thought it was very good, it wasn't something that I just raved about and thought was the best thing ever.  I took it to a kids Halloween party and they were more interested in the cookies that went with it rather than the dip itself.  I made the mistake of not reading the size of the ingredients before going shopping and only bought the 8 oz. container of whipped topping.  I must say that it still turned out really well and I think adding another 8 oz. would make it too light and fluffy and take away from the pumpkin flavor.

Sooooo good! I used home grown and pureed pumpkin, which I imagine is much better than canned pumpkin. I don't buy Cool Whip, so I made my own whipped cream and folded it in. I served it with some nutmeg sprinkled on top for a nice touch. We dipped Arrowroot cookies in it, but I'm looking forward to trying different treats with it tomorrow during round 2! The family really loved this and we will definitely be making this again (including for an upcoming party). Adding a little extra spice is recommended :) Enjoy! Happy autumn!

I used 8oz cool whip and 1 bar of softened neufchatel cream cheese. I also doubled the amount of spice.  Mixed it all up and put it into a gallon ziplock bag.  When it came time to serve, I cut one of the corners of the bag and piped the dip into the serving bowl.  I Served it with Nilla wafers and ginger snaps.  People also spooned it onto some pumpkin bread and said they thought it would make a great topping for pumpkin muffins. It was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Lighter than I thought it would be.  Pretty tasty- served it with Nilla Wafers and Ginger Snaps.  Next time I may add a bit more spice. This would be SO good in a pie shell and frozen- YUMMO!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!  I have made this many times and it always is a huge hit at parties, especially when served in a pumpkin this time of year.  It couldn't be easier and people always seem impressed, doesn't get much better!

Super dip. I served homemade ginger cookies and sliced Honey Crisp apples with it. Everyone loved it.

I had been trying forever to recreate Coco's Harvest Pie.  This is the closest that I have found for the mousse topping that goes on top of the pumpkin pie.  My hubby and I cannot get enough of this stuff!  Yum Yum Yum.  And It keeps for about a week in the fridge.

We realized we didn't have the right sized ingredients, so we used 2 cups of fresh cooked pumpkin, 1 small box of pudding and 1/2 of the whipped topping.  It worked great & has a great conversation at Thanksgiving as something new on the snack table.

First of all, unless you're making enough for a marching band, I can't imagine why you'd ever want to make the full recipe!  Like others have noted, make sure to notice that the sizes of the Cool Whip and pudding...both call for the large size (but the smaller can of pumpkin).  I made this just before the party - I didn't think it would stay fluffy after it sat.  Actually, it has now been in the refrigerator for about three days, and it's still good!  As far as taste, I thought it was good, but maybe a little bland - just didn't taste like much.  Some really liked it, some just thought it was okay.  I served it with both cinnamon-sugar graham sticks and apple slices.  My husband and I both agreed it was much better with the apples!  I might make this again for a fall party.  Great for kids!

First of all, what could be easier than this? It literally took about a minute to make this! Secondly, YUM! Delicious! Everyone loved it (especially my nephews, who devoured it). I halved the recipe and it was plenty (served probably 15 people sufficiently). Thank you!

This was pretty good but it needed more pumkin flavor I think.  I took it to two different parties and didn't get any rave review or requests for the recipe.  If I make it again I will use more spices and more pumpkin.  The cool whip overpowered it.

This is wonderful. Instead of a big vanilla pudding I used a small vanilla and a small cheesecake pudding.  I used almost double the pumpkin pie extract too.  SOOOOOO good. I used graham crackers and ginger snaps to serve with. On the crackers, it tastes just like pumpkin pie.  

I took this to a family function last weekend and had a few people request I make it for Thanksgiving coming up.

I made this for our Halloween party.  It was excellent and I got a lot of complements on it.
I made only one change.  Since it's Halloween/Thanksgiving season, Jello had "Pumpkin Spice" pudding in the store.  So I bought that instead of vanilla pudding and I eliminated the pumpkin spice.  Turned out excellent.  I served it with graham crackers.  Next time I make it I'll use the vanilla pudding and pumpkin spice to see if there is much difference.

The is so cute served in a small hollowed out pumpkin! I baked my pumpkin at 250 degrees for about an hour first to dry out the interior. This is best served with cinnamon graham cracker sticks and was a huge hit at our family chili supper.

I took this to a "pumpkin potluck" and won the prize for best dish! This is really yummy; tastes just like pumpkin pie without being so heavy and filling. Be aware, though, the recipe as is makes A LOT of dip! I halfed it and still had tons of leftovers after a party full of twenty-somethings!

This was amazing.  I made it for my dad's b-day party last weekend and everyone loved it.  I did have suggestions of putting this into a graham cracker crust... I will try this next time but I bet it's good.

I served it with granny apples, nilla wafers and graham cracker sticks.

I made 2 batches of this yesterday.  One batch I pretty much followed the recipe except did add 1 tsp. of vanilla and used the Lite Cool Whip and Fat Free/Sugar free instant pudding.  The 2nd batch, I used 2 sm. containers of Cool Whip Free and FF/SF Instant Butterscotch pudding!  The 2nd batch was even better!!!!  Everyone that had it loved it and wanted the recipe.  This is the easiest sweet appetizer I've ever made!  Thank you!!!!

This recipe was very easy to make.  I agree with another reviewer in that its best if chilled overnight.  I used vanilla pudding mix - but the butterscoth sounds like a very good idea, too - think i'll try that  next time.  Everyone kept asking what it was and where I got the recipe.  It's a big batch - I was able to divide it between two christmas parties.  Served it with gingerbread cookies and quickbread.  Despite the presentation and the scattering of cookies surrounding it - a few people mistakenly took it for cheese dip and were more than a little surprised :)  Will definately make again.

Very, very easy and everyone loved it.  My husband, kids and friends would all give it 5 stars, but I only gave it 4 because I thought it was good, not great.  To me, it tasted like pumpkin and cool whip - but nothing special.  It was good and I would make it again because everyone loved it.  I used the lite cool whip and sugar free pudding to save a few calories.  I use these all the time in baking and you can't tell the difference!

A perfect recipe for this time of year.  You only need to use 8 oz. of the Cool Whip, trust me!  I brought this to our Neighborhood Block party and it was a hit.  I served it in an orange bowl on a Halloween platter that held gingersnaps and graham cracker sticks.  My husband preferred it with pretzels and that combination of the sweet dip and the salty pretzel was really, really good!

This went over very well at my annual "fall" coctail party. I served it in a hollowed out pumpkin. I used the graham cracker sticks (only found at Shaw's in my area). I will be using it as a fall themed wedding shower.

Wow!! Sooooo good!!  Adults and kids both love this and it's so pretty to serve, even without a pumpkin bowl.  This is a tastier and lighter dip than the "Pumpkin Dip" on this website, and much more attractive.  It's fluffy texture is wonderful with fruit (apple slices, strawberries, cantaloupe slices) and very attractive to serve.  And definitely use only ONE 8oz. container of whipped cream.  2 containers was way too much and overpowered the flavor of the pumpkin.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so use 1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves.  Perfect!!  Try this recipe- you WON'T regret it.

Made this for a Halloween pumpkin carving party. Every single person asked for the recipe. Our favorite was dipping them with ginger snaps and apples.

I cut the recipe in half (I saved the hlaf a box of vanilla pudding to make the recipe again) as I wasn't feeding a crowd. I served granny smith apple slices, ginger snaps & vanilla wafers w/ it. I don't think granny smith is the right choice of apples for this...I think a sweeter apple would pair better. The gingersnaps went the best. My eldest grandson liked them so much, he suggested I give out baggies of the dip & gingersnaps to trick or treaters. LOL Thansk Tiera!

This was OK.  I actually expected it to be a bit better than it was judging by the previous reviews.  I guess it was too "fluffy" or something.  I was thinking it would have a more intense pumpkin flavor, which it did not.  If I made it again I would reduce the amount of Cool Whip.

I'm not a fan of pumpkin but this is really good. I've made this a few times already and everyone loves it.      Only thing I changed was I used 8oz of cool whip and served it with gram cracker sticks.  Make sure you have copies of this recipe as people will ask for it.

This dip tasted nice and was super simple to make but I don't think I would make it again only because I thought it was too light. I like my pumpkin treats to have more substance to them. Everybody that tried it at my Xmas party enjoyed it and I gave out the recipe to a friend of mine. The recipe also does make a lot of dip!

VERY GOOD!! I used fat free cool whip, sugar free fat free vanilla pudding, and reduced fat graham crackers to cut back on calories. It tasted exactly like pumpkin pie. I took it to a gathering of friends and they just loved it so much they all asked for the recipe.

This was very good, but I used less whipped topping than the recipe called for.  It just seemed like it was becoming pumpkin flavored whipped topping. I used about  12 ounces, next time I will use even less.  But overall, very delicious!  My kids love it, it's a nice seasonal treat.  Thank you!

This is easy and very yummy!  I'm renaming it, though, to 'Pumpkin Mousse'.  You could easily dress it up for a fancy dinner with small cookies on the side.  I also tried spreading it between two vanilla wafers, and refrigerating.  Great idea!  The dip softened the cookies for a yummy snack! (Think Little Debbie oatmeal cream pies...)

Got rave reviews for it at Thanksgiving. I messed up and used pumpkin pie filling instead of the packed pumpkin but it still turned out great! I used 1 8oz. tub of french vanilla cool whip, and gave the options of using graham crackers (cinnamon), green apples or butter pound cake. Everyone went for the pound cake! Its WONDERFUL!!!

Four stars as written, five stars with modifications. I used 8 oz. of Cool Whip due to previous reviews, a 3.4 oz box of vanilla pudding (all I had) and instead of pumpkin pie spice (didn't have any) I used dashes of allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon and ground cloves. I sprinkled nutmeg on top for a pretty presentation. I thought it was so-so on the evening I made it, but when I took it into work the next morning - delicious! Make sure you give this time for the flavors to meld together. I was asked numerous times for the recipe and also someone came up to me to mention that I just had to try the pumpkin dip - they didn't know that I had made it! I served this with the new cinnamon graham cracker "fingers" (love not having to break them apart!) and gingersnaps. What a fun dip for autumn. I think that this would also make a nice cupcake topping.

while i liked the taste and ease of this pumpkin dip, it got mixed reviews from the different people that tasted it.  looked a little too much like queso and tasted a little bit like baby food.  But its worth making when you need a holiday appetizer

I made this dip for Thanksgiving.  Response from my not-so-receptive family..."What is that?"  I'm not sure what to do with all the leftovers (makes a ton) since it was barely touched.

I thought it was ok (a little too much pumpkin for my taste).  Needless to say, it won't become part of our holiday tradition!

I will make this again, and again. This is a very easy, simply-flavored "child-friendly" dip to serve at appropriate gatherings. We made it last Thanksgiving, and the Thanksgiving before. I saved myself some time this past year and just brought printed copies of the recipe with me - everyone asks for it! We will be making this tonight to serve with apples and graham crackers for tomorrow's snack at school. I appreciate that the ingredients can be modified to individual preferences (such as fat free Cool Whip, or a more 'refined' homemade whipped cream of heavy whipping cream + confectioner's sugar, sugar free pudding, etc). To the reviewer who gave this recipe 1 star, who claims their palette may just be too refined, too 'Barefoot Contessa'-y to enjoy this recipe, who lamented 'not seeing a review beforehand' to warn them of what they were making - sorry, dude. If your palette is so advanced, your cooking skills so supreme, you should have had *some* idea of  what these four simple, 'pedestrian' ingredients are going to come together to make....

I make it as-is with no changes to the recipe and it's perfect!  "Simple ingredients, easy to make, and crowd-pleasing" earns this recipe its 5 Stars!  I serve the chilled dip in a chip-dip set so the dip can be surrounded by an assortment of cookies including cinnamon grahams, Ivins' Famous Spiced Wafers, 'Nilla Wafers, and ginger snaps.

I followed the recipe but felt it didn't have enough pumpkin flavor...too much like just cool whip so I added a 2nd can of pumpkin and another tsp of pumpkin spice. It was PERFECT then! I would suggest adding the extra pumpkin and pumpkin spice if you want more of a pumpkin flavor like me :-) Served with ginger snaps, cinnamon teddy grahams and cinnamon sugar pita chips.

This was delicious, but I'm giving it 3 stars because the recipe doesn't specify whether the instant pudding should be prepared prior to mixing with the remaining ingredients.  Am I the only one who was confused by this?

It was super easy to make!  I made this for a game night with friends, and everyone loved it!  It tastes just like pumpkin pie.  I served it with cinnamon graham crackers as suggested.  I only used about 12 oz of whipped topping instead of the full 16, because it was a small gathering, and the 12 oz was plenty.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! It was light, fluffy, and the pumpkin wasn't overpowering. I followed the recipe closely however I could not find pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon. It still tasted great! I sprinkled some more cinnamon on top and served with cinnamon graham crackers. REMEMBER to FOLD in the cool whip, don't just stir! Folding it in makes it fluffy and if you stir your consistency won't be right. This would honestly make a great filling or topping for cake or cupcakes! It's so light I think I might try it as "icing" on vanilla or pumpkin cupcakes. I like dipping the crackers but at one point I was basically eating it with a spoon. WILL make this again.

I've made this every Thanksgiving for the past 8 yrs. Everyone loves it, a few yrs ago I started using sugar-free cheesecake flavored pudding mix & lite cool whip. Without telling that I changed the recipe, everyone commented that my dip tasted better that year and they all started asking if I had done something different. I serve my dip with ginger snaps and graham cracker sticks.

I'm giving 4 stars because it's way too much cool whip. I used 8oz instead and that fixed the problem. Other than that, it's a delicious, super easy recipe. I put this together in under 3 minutes. Just make sure to thaw your cool whip and you're good to go. This stuff is very addicting!

I made this into a pie using a pie shell and a little corn starch to firm it and instead of vanilla pudding I used sugarfree butterscotch and reduced fat whip topping it was wonderful and diabetic friendly

Easy and good. I swapped the solid packed pumpkin and spice for pumpkin pie filling (already flavored), and I add a splash or so of vanilla. I served it with cinnamon graham crackers and my 2 1/2 yo loved it.

I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this.  Someone brought this in to work and pretty near everyone asked for the recipe, including myself. It's easy and amazing.  Making it for the 2nd time myself, as I have company coming over tomorrow for an early Easter dinner get together.

Love this recipe. I made it as a snack at Christmas dinner. But because my family is mexican I served it with flour tortilla chips. I buttered flour tortilla chips and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar.  Everyone loved it. I had no left overs to take home. Fyi this makes more than u think. If you are making this for the first time  write down the recipe on some cards cause you will get plenty of people asking for the recipe !

It was ok.   I really does serve a ton of people, but mostly because people try it once or twice, and they are done with it.   I think maybe cutting the whipped cream in half and adding cinnamon and vanilla would help, but honestly, I just don't see me making this again.

Yummm.  I loved this....I used fat free cool whip and didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used apple pie spice and added a little more ginger and cinnamon to taste.  Great idea!

Easy to make, makes loads, and everyone loves it. What more could you want?  

I followed the suggestion in the video-version of this recipe and used this as a filling between two spice cookies and froze it. Makes a delicious ice cream sandwich!

I made it as is but started off using half the whipped cream (8oz) as other reviewers suggested.  Did not like it at all.  Tasted exactly like bland pumpkin flavored whip cream (but more on the whip cream side) and that's with only using half the recommended whipped cream.  So, I read more of the reviews and added (one by one until I liked the taste) a package of cream cheese, doubled the pumpkin (to to a total of a 29oz can), added another half a package of pudding, and 2-3 more teaspoons of spices to get it just right.  I then hollowed out a small pumpkin and froze it overnight (loved this idea and was perfect for serving).  I refrigerated the dip overnight to let the flavors come out and in the end, it tasted exactly like pumpkin pie!  I served with graham crackers and it was a total hit at the party.  Warning though, this recipe makes a huge amount.  With about 25 people at the party, only half was eaten (it makes that much!).

I made this for my 4yo's birthday party yesterday and it was a hit!  I made it just as the recipe calls for and served it with cinnamon graham crackers and fresh fruit.  It was all gone by the time the party was over.  A couple of people were not that impressed when I asked what they thought of it, so I guess it's one of those love it or hate it recipes  :)  I will definitely be making it again for our family though!

Delicious and EASY!  Be sure pay close attention to the serving size of the ingredients; otherwise you will end up with a completely different taste/consistency (that I can only assume would taste terrible).  I serve mine with cinnamon grahams or animal crackers.

I made this last night for a party I am attending today.  I took the advise of others and used a package of light cream cheese and only 8 oz container of whip cream.  I also added vanilla and a little sugar.  It turned out fabulous. I am serving it with cinnamon graham crackers, vanilla wafers and apple slices.

It's a good base idea, that can be changed for personal preferences.  Our household likes strong flavors, and doesn't have much of a sweet tooth.  We tweaked it for our tastes by adding 2 cans of pumpkin, only 1.5 8oz tubs of cool whip, and a regular sized package of pudding.  We also doubled the spices.  With the changes, for our household, it's a 5!

Made a few modifications  - used a 29 oz can of pumpkin, 8 oz of cool whip, about 3 oz of cream cheese  and 2 t of pumpkin pie spice.  We actually liked it a little thicker with more of a pumpkin flavor which was achieved by doubling the pumpkin and only using half of the cool whip.  Very good on cinnamon graham crackers and granny smith apples.

We did not like this at all.  I agree with others who did not like this dish that felt it was not sweet enough.  I kinda thought it tasted like baby food.

I made this for a Halloween party and it was a big hit.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I made it exactly as written, except I used lite whipped topping (it was all the store had).  
We used apples, pears, cinnamon graham crackers and gingersnaps for dipping.  All were tasty with this dip.  (I liked the cinnamon graham crakers the best)

This is a quick easy dip. If you love pumpkin pie this is something you will enjoy. I am not crazy about strong pumpkin flavor, next time I will use a little less pumpkin.

Really Yummy!  I used the large 29 oz can of pumpkin because the smaller can just didn't add enough pumpkin taste.  I also hollowed out a small pumpkin and froze it before I added the dip to it... that way the dip stays cold all night long.

I served this the other night and everyone loved it.  I had to give the recipe to several people.  I served is with Nilla Wafers but someone suggested ginger snaps. Either way, the dip itself is DELICIOUS and simple to make.

This was so easy!  I couldn't find a 5 oz box of pudding, so I used (2) 3 oz boxes.  I also used the "Extra Creamy" version of frozen whipped topping.  This was so dreamy!  It was a hit at my office Christmas party!  I simply served it with ginger snaps.  It was a tasty, but light, sweet dessert.  This recipe is a keeper!

I took this to a Halloween Party with apples and graham crackers...everyone loved it with the cinnamon graham crackers.  The next day I made an apple crisp with the leftover apples, used the graham crackers in my crumble topping and the dip instead of whipped cream.  It was delicious.

Very good.  Made it exactly as recipe reads.  Tastes like a pumpkin pie whipped cream.  I liked it the best with gingersnaps, but the store bought kind are way too hard.  Will try making my own cookies to use with this fluff.  Should be awesome!

So delicious!  I doubled the pumpkin and at least tripled the spices for more flavor.  I also used a cheesecake flavor instant pudding instead of vanilla, to make it taste like pumpkin cheesecake.

I am not a fan of this. . .but my kids like it.  I thought it was too sweet so I added more pumpkin to try and fix it.  Turns out it just isn't something for me.  I'll try the other pumpkin dip on this site because I do absolutely love pumpkin.

This was very easy to make!  I did use pumpkin pie filling instead of adding the spice and it had great taste, I also used the whole 30oz can instead of just the 15oz. This recipe makes A LOT of dip so we had quite a bit left over and put a couple of spoon fulls in our magic bullet along with fresh brewed coffee and it made the perfect pumpkin spice late froth and all!

I don't like Pumpkin, except in this dip. One of my co-workers brought this to the pot luck and everyone wanted the recipe; Including me.  It really looks great severed in a pumpkin shell.

I made a few changes too...After making the pudding (using low fat milk) and waiting 5 mins for the pudding to set,   I then added a larger can of pumpkin (I think it was 24oz) can, then I added a few pinches of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamin (which is basically what pumpin pie spice is anyway), then I folded in half of the amount of whipped topping. 16oz. would have been way too much and made it way too sweet. Half of it made my dip just perfect! I put spiced wafers in a plastic bag and banged them gently with a hammer on my floor (again, be gentle so you don't make holes in the bag), then sprinked them on the dip. SO yummy!

It was a lighter texture than I wanted so I had to add 8oz cream cheese then it was perfect for what I wanted. Everyone flipped. So good on apples and on pumpkin spice cake.

I first tried this at my MIL's, she made it per recipie but used light cool whip and sugar free pudding mix. It was good. When I made it I only used half the cool whip and it was not diet anything. Still good, the kids love it, I just like it.

This is amazingly wonderful! I am in charge of refreshments tonight at my OES meeting and the girls will love this! I will be serving this with Cranberry Pumpkin Cookies, also from this site which are great too! Cinnamon graham crackers are real good with this too. These will be my new Holiday goodies. Do not omit the orange zest. These flavors mingle well.

It was okay. I could not find packed pumpkin in the store so I had to use a brand that was very runny. Next time I will search for the packed canned pumpkin mix.  I used Ginger snaps and that was a hit with the family. I will make this for Thanksgiving because I think I will find canned pumpkin in my area easier.

One of the hits of the party.  Best part it is not filling so after eating all the other stuff a little Pumpkin Fluff hit the spot.

Got this recipe from a friend who made it for my baby shower! I loved it and baby did too! I made it again and used a bit more spice (1/2 tsp of each: cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg) and real whipped cream instead of the frozen whipped topping. We also served it with grapes, strawberries and apple slices. Will make this over and over!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  This is a great, light and refreshing snack for any occasion.  I made some homemade cinnamon chips to dip - spritz flour tortillas with water and sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  Cut into wedges and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  Cool for 15 minutes prior to serving.

I judge how great a recipe is by how many requests I get for copies - in this case, this should be 10 stars!  Excellent reviews from family and friends - I even sent this to day care with Scooby-Doo cinnamon graham crackers for their Halloween party.  It is excellent for kids and a nice break from chocolate and candy!

I made this for an Adult Halloween party and was asked for the recipe 5 times! I added a bit more pudding mix and less whipped cream. But other than that it was a simple and tasty dip for the season.

I made this (along with Moms Ginger Snaps) for a Halloween Party last night.  WONDERFUL!  I followed another reviewers review and doubled the pumpkin, but next time I'll follow the recipe to a T.  I think the extra may have taken away from it a bit.  But it was delicious regardless!

This is an awesome dip!  I make it quite a bit this time of year.  My coworkers love it, my family loves it, I love it!  And it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO easy to make!  The hollowed out pumpkin is a great little presentation.  Great with cinnamon graham sticks, apple slices, ginger snaps, nilla wafers.

OMG this is incredible!  I have three kids and try to volunteer to bring in goodies for the class parties.  I usually make zucchini bread but it's a lot of work so I went hunting and found this beauty of a recipe!  How EASY and DELICIOUS!!
Teachers amongst other parents were asking for the recipe and raving over how good it was.  
I will say that it yields more than you might think.  I doubled the recipe because I didn't think this would all fit in the size pumpkin I bought and ooops made way too much!  Deffinitely make a single batch then make another if needed since it's so easy.
Thanks for this incredible recipe!

I have to admit I was a little embarrassed that everybody loved this so much as it is so easy.  I wouldn't tell anybody what was in it but it was a big hit. I did reduce the cool whip (and I subbed light, who can tell the difference) as was suggested. My son had brought a small pumpkin home for school so we used that for the dip, nice presentation and a good recipe to make with your kids.

I adapted the recipe to what I had on hand.  I used an 8 oz tub of Cool Whip, a small box of pudding, and kept everything else the same.  We dipped cinnamon grahams, and gingersnaps in it.  Then I had left over pie crust that I baked with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top, and we dipped those.  That was the best!  Yummy recipe!  But I do recommend using less Cool Whip and pudding, like I did.

Holy cow this is good, and use sugar free/fat free pudding and cool whip and you got a figure friendly snack.  Great with apples.  Yummy!!!

Excellent & SO EASY!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice (or allspice) on hand, I googled & easily found how I could make my own allspice, and then from that make the pumpkin pie spice.  I kept the extra (with holidays around the corner, I'm sure I'll use it!) in the pantry.

VERY GOOD! This will be served at a football party (our team colors are orange & white) and I'm sure will be a big hit.  I'll be serving with cinnamon grahams and (my fave) nilla wafers.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE INGREDIENT SIZES!  I accidentally didn't, so I ended up halfing the recipe to make it work.  It is SO awesome!  I did it with plain lowfat graham crackers. I used cheesecake instant jello instead of vanilla. VERY tasty!  People asked for the recipe!

Very good. I served with cinnamon graham crackers and there was not a bite left. I used more pumpkin pie spice and added extra nutmeg, and also used cheesecake pudding mix instead of the vanilla pudding. Yumm!!

This was great!  I just halved the recipe since it makes a lot.  I loved how it is so light and not to sweet.  I did add a little cinnamon and sugar to it.  I served it with cinnamon graham crackers, but I loved to eat it by itself.  We was worried that it might have a strong pumpkin flavor from the canned pumpkin but it just had a hint of it and was perfect!  This is a keeper!

I eat this as a regular pudding, not as a dip. So I don't use as much whipped topping, so that it has more of a pudding consistency. Amazing!

WAY too much pumpkin.  I ended up adding an entire 8 oz. carton of cream cheese and quite a bit of powdered sugar in order to "tone it down" a bit.  I took it to a Halloween party with Nilla Wafers and everyone raved... I was very pleased with the end result, but because the initial recipe needed alteration I couldn't give it a higher rating.  I will make again as adjusted though.

I halved the whipped cream and doubled the spice - and then used this to fill the "Cream Puffs" recipe (a la allrecipes!) for a Halloween potluck I attended. They make the perfect fluffy filling! I didn't want a custard or something too airy, but the density due to the pudding mix/can/whipped cream was a great consistency. I only wish I could have disguised the underlying "cool whip" flavor, but it's really only noticeable if you're looking for it. I also couldn't help tasting it as I filled the pastries - and I do say it's marvelous on it's own too!

Seriously fantastic and simple! I made for a university student seminar and ran out of dip within the first half hour, people begged me to go make more. Pretzels and sliced apples were the favorite dipper.
 THANK YOU!!

Very quick and easy to make. Not to mention, lactose free. (No lactose in regular cool whip or in jell-o brand instant vanilla pudding mix!)

Tastes like spreadable pumpkin pie. Think I might try it with more pumpkin and a bit less cool whip next time, to get the pumpkin flavor really pumped up. 

Perfect, quick, party-finger-food solution!

It basically tasted like fluffly pumpkin pie...(which I don't like and my husband loves and he only said this dip was ok).  I only had a large can of pumpkin on hand so I double the recipe.  One batch I made as per the directions (only cutting back on cool whip to 8 oz) and the other I added 8 oz cream cheese and 1 1/2 packages of cheesecake pudding and 8 oz cool whip.  Out of the two I prefered the one with cream cheese over the original version.

excellent! I made this for a pampered chef party last night and everyone raved about it.  I served it with gingersnaps and apple slices.  The only thing I changed was that I used cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla.

I have made this twice now, both times to rave reviews.  I have to admit though that I pay very little attention to the measurements given.  I just make it to taste.  I have found that 3/4 of the big can of pumpkin, 3/4 of the mid size cool whip, 1 and 3/4 packets instant vanilla pudding and pumpkin pie spice to taste (about the teaspoon advised) work best.

Like others, I cut down on the amount of cool-whip to about 6oz (3/4 of the 8oz container). I took it to a Top Chef finale party and everyone loved it, especially the presentation (I carved the top chef logo into the pumpkin). Best part was that I had a little leftover to pack for lunch the next day, and it held up well.

Next time, I might try to experiment by using the cheesecake flavored pudding mix they have out now.

This recipe was a hit! I made it for a party we recently had and I had several requests for the recipe. It was so easy to make...it satisfied my pumpkin pie craving for sure. Served with Nilla Wafers and Cinnamon Wheat Thins...both were great options!

Made this for my son's birthday party and it was a smash.  I served it with graham cracker sticks and there wasn't a drop left.  Several people asked me for the recipe.  His grandma even requested I make it for Thanksgiving.

This is really good with ginger snaps...a good variation at parties since most people bring savory dishes.  I followed other reviewers and didn't use as much whipped topping.  Very festive for the holidays!

This made a TON of dip!  In competition with a pot luck snack day, it lost big time.  Got a very mixed reaction -- some loved it, but many didn't even touch it.  I ended up throwing 3/4 of it away.  I would find a way to halve the recipe for average sized groups.

I bet it would be great in a cinnamon-spiced pie crust...

Just had this at my Boyds bear party and it was a big hit.Like others I used a small container of cool whip.Everyone wanted the recipe.Serves well with cinnamon graham sticks.They do make them now and that made it easier to dip.

Oh my goodness is this ever good! We had this with fruit and ginger snaps but I just noticed that a popular brand of graham crackers just came out with ginger grahams which I think would be wonderful with this. I could literally eat this stuff with a spoon and I can't wait to serve it again on Halloween. Thanks so much Tiera!

This is one of my most requested recipes through the holidays, I have made it for preschoolers and in place of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, all to rave reviews, have served with ginger snaps, grahams and apple slices can't go wrong!  Thanks, love it!

Delicious!  As others suggested I used pumpkin pie filler instead of the packed pumpkin and pumpkin spice.  Also, I used only 8 oz of cool whip, rather than 16 oz.  I made it for a potluck at work and it was a big hit.  Also, it was incredible easy to make!!

This is definitely a great dip.  Something different from the usual.  I used cinnamon graham cracker sticks which worked perfectly.  The only problem with this recipe is that is makes SO much dip!  Next time I'll definitely only make half.

Like many others, I reduced the amount of whipped topping to taste more of the pumpkin. It was great! Different and a big hit! Thanks.

This recipe is great!  I ended up just using canned pumpkin pie filling instead of a can of pumpkin and spices.  It made the recipe even easier than it already is.  Everyone at my party loved the dip and I will definitely make it again.

I made this to take to a Halloween party and gots lots of compliments on it.  I had a couple of people ask for the recipe as well.  I love anything pumpkin flavored, and thought this was delicious.  This recipe makes lots of dip, I had enough leftover that I put into a graham cracker pie crust.  Thanks for the different idea, and yummy recipe.

This is so good. I've had other pumpkin dips using cream cheese. This is much lighter. I topped it with Autumn "jimmies" Served it with Grammy Bears, Ginger snaps, Nilla wafers and sliced apples. It made a wondeful presentation. I'm really glad the recipe was so simple because a dozen people wanted it. Thanks

Hey, this is really good. I made it to try and get my 6 year old to eat some veggies. I used fat free whipped topping. I only made 1/2 the recipe to try it. We dipped graham crackers. He liked it ok. I doubt he'll request it, but I wont have to force feed him.

I made this last year as an appetizer for thanksgiving and no one ate it b/c they were saving room for the main course.  So I brought it to work to have them finish it.  No one really said if they liked it or not, but just recently a girl who remembered it asked me to bring it again.  I did.  She didn't really like pumpkin, but she still really loved it!  Then she kept making people who said I don't like pumpkin try it.  Everyone who tried it loved it!  People that like pumpkin also liked it!  It's a great recipe.

A good dessert dip, but it needed a little jazzing-up, so the second time I made this, I used French Vanilla cool whip, an extra teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and one 3oz. vanilla pudding plus one 3oz BUTTERSCOTCH pudding. AND for some strange reason, the flavor is better if you serve it right away/the same day. For a party, I served this in a small, hollowed out pie pumpkin.

This is a great recipe.  I took it to a pot luck and got several requests for the recipe.  Nobody could believe how easy it is to make.  I followed the suggestions from other reviews and used half of the cool whip called for.

So easy & very yummy, too!!  I went to a party where this was served in a small, hollowed-out pumpkin.  The dip was so delicious and looked so pretty in the pumpkin, too!  Very good with either graham crackers (perfect to use the little "stick" size) or gingersnaps.  A light and easy, festive treat to bring to any parties!

I was looking for a recipe using pumpkin that my preschool class might enjoy when I came across this one. Perfect! Many of them tried and those that did all liked it.I was shopping without the recipe and unfortunately my memory was lacking so as prepared by me it went like this: 16 oz pureed fresh pumpkin,1 8oz container cool whip, 1 3.5 oz pkg instant vanilla pudding mix, 3 T. maple syrup, and "some" cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, allspice. It was very good and I would make it that way again.

Very bland as written.  I intended to halve the recipe, but ended up adding all of the pumpkin & pudding mix, and 3 or 4 teaspoons of spice.  It was good with the graham cracker sticks & with pretzels, but not a big hit.

I made this Christmas day for the younger kids, since the adults were having cheesecake.  So easy and what a hit!  I used regular and cinnamon graham "sticks" that they have out now.  I halved the recipe; it makes a lot!

Made this recipe... 1)It is really nummy and 2) Very easy to put together. It is the most requested recipe for office functions or home parties. Everyone wants the recipe!! I also tried a different type of cracker. Could not find the cinnamon crackers recommended. Use the "Nilla" Vanilla Wafer crackers. Next to the graham crackers in grocery stores. They are 1" in diameter and make a perfect dipping cracker. Thank you for sharing this recipe!! :-)

We loved this!  I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it!  We used cinnamon graham sticks and ginger snaps for dipping.  Next time I make it I will use 1/2 the cool whip as I would like a more pupkin-y flavor!!

This is a great treat in the fall!  A hit with cinnamon grahams or ginger cookies.  Everyone loves it, even some hard-to-please co-workers.  It does make a large amount, as others mentioned.

My seven year old daughter really enjoyed making this.  The whole family loved it - even the ones that don't like pumpkin!  Try it with spicy ginger snaps.

Wow!!!  Super easy, and a huge hit for our fall party...  I don't think I've ever had so many requests for a recipe.  Most everyone preferred it with gingersnaps, but I'm a fan of plain 'ole graham crackers.

I love this dip. My family and friends love it too. Its easy and light. We are always coming up with different things to dip in it. Its also good frozen.to me at least. Lol. I would suggest freezing a small amount to see if you like it first, before freezing the whole bowl. Lol.

I came across a recipe very similar to this one but required fluff as one of the ingredients (and I don't like fluff) so I searched for recipes similar to it. I came across this one and had to try it. 
I used ingredients that others had mentioned in their reviews. I used 2 15oz cans of pumpkin puree, 1 6oz of softened cream cheese, 1 8oz of lite whip cream, pumpkin pie and ground ginger spices. 
I haven't tried it yet but my husband said he'll eat it up. Lol

Recipe worked fine.  Also tried the same basic recipe but substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the canned pumpkin and McCormick apple pie spice for the Pumpkin spice.  Works great and tastes great!

I made it with sugar free pudding and sugar free cool whip for a diabetic version and it was wonderful. I might try it with no-dairy cool whip next time.  Yum!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  It would also be great in a pre-baked pie or graham cracker pie shell. When i tried it, chopped pecans were added to the top. I will serve it at all holiday meals from now on.

I LOVE this recipe- easy to make and delicious to eat!  I add 2 oz.  of low fat cream cheese and a little bit of protein milk (Kirkland brand) to it to make it a bit more creamy.  Also, I enjoy dipping apple slices in it as you can still taste the pumpkin flavor.  Sometimes the ginger snaps overwhelm the pumpkin flavor.  They are both good with the dip-I prefer apple slices though.

Every fall I’m asked to bring this to bunco. It always goes fast. I’ve even made this with sugar free pudding and lite cool whip which is good but making exactly as the recipe is written is what scores 5 stars.  Thank you for sharing!

I think this is a perfect recipe just as written! It was so delicious I personally could not stop eating it! I tried it with regular graham crackers and with cinnamon grahams, and the cinnamon really enhanced the whole flavor experience. I will be making this as a Thanksgiving appetizer, and probably as often as I have an excuse to make it! The guests I originally made it for loved it as well, and dipped vegetables as well as grahams into it.

I dislike anything pumpkin, but we needed a simple pumpkin recipe that a young child could make.  This was delicious!  We didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so we substituted cinnamon, which we like better anyways.  For a young child, we had to use the mixer to mix together everything because it is really difficult for young children to fold in the whipped topping.  Yummy with Teddy Grahams and graham crackers!

If you love whipped cream or whipped topping all by itself, you would like this recipe. I can't really taste whipped cream or whipped topping,  so even with the pumpkin flavor to help, it's still bland for me.  It's attractive on the table, and I might serve it again if it were part of a larger spread of choices for guests.

Made this for an office potluck. Tried to make a double batch and accidentally used banana pudding mix. I thought it was vanilla! Turned out just fine. In fact everyone loved it with the oops. Used one packet vanilla pudding and one banana. Added some vanilla extract to take the edge off the banana. Then I took it to family Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Twice! Will definitely make again.

Tastes like pumpkin spice marshmallow fluff- love it! 
One thing: if you are someone who loves spices, I would advise you to add more (than the 1 tsp the recipe calls for).

I used 3.5oz. Pudding mix, 8 oz. Natural whip cream and 3/4 can of pumpkin  along with tsp. Of  pumpkin pie spice, it was excellent.   I also carved out the pumpkin and the whip topping container fit inside the top and worked perfectly for dipping.
Will make this throughout the fall season! !

This recipe has been a favorite at our Halloween parties for years.  To get the true pumpkin flavor though we use only an 8 ounce container of whipped topping.  This provides chance for the pumpkin pie spice to come through so need to make sure that what use quality pumpkin pie spice or make your own fresh.

This small of a recipe fits into a small pumpkin cut in bowl shape.  Scooby snacks work the best for dipping since they don't overwhelm the pumpkin flavor and add an extra appeal for the younger folks.

After reading so many reviews stating that the recipe made a huge amount and had a texture that many people didn't like, I adjusted the recipe a bit.  I used 2 T canned pumpkin, 2 T cream cheese, 2 t vanilla pudding.  Mixed those ingredients then added a dash of cinnamon and 2 T of Cool Whip.  My family liked it.  They didn't rave about it, but liked it enough to empty the bowl.It's tasty with graham crackers and apple slices.  I'm going to make this for a tailgate party next weekend.

This is a great, easy and delicious dip.  I've made it for office gatherings several times, and everyone raves about it.  I prefer to use gingersnaps for dipping -- they give it a bit more zip!

Love this dip! Always a huge hit at fall get together's. It does make  a lot of dip though. So unless you are having 20+people I would recommend halving the amount.

Made this recipe many times as it is a favorite at my family gatherings.  I serve it in a chilled pumpkin.  The chilled pumpkin keeps the dip fresh and cool, and makes a very nice presentation.  Received many compliments on both the dip and on the presentation.

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just added the same spices I would in a pumpkin pie, I actually added an extra amount.  I think the next time I make it am going to add cream cheese.  I used cinnamon graham crackers like another person suggested.  It was a hit!

not a fan. I used pumpkin pie spice and made the recipe exactly as written, but the taste of clove was too strong. would recommend decreasing that ingredient or making your own blend to control the final product.

I only use a 12 ounce tub of cool whip. I feel this made the pumpkin taste stronger and family loves it. Great recipe!  Made this last year for office party! They are asking me to bring it this year too!

Made this for my husband's 40th birthday this past Saturday and I have to say everyone was asking for the recipe. It's so easy you can do it in your sleep. And the set up was beyond cute and perfect for fall! I used cinnamon graham crackers, honey graham crackers, and gingersnaps to eat  it with! I will be making this every year for fall!

Delicious & easy. Took it to a party & it was a crowd pleaser. One tip, try to get a "carving pumpkin" that is extra extra small verses using a "pie pumpkin". I used a pie pumpkin & had a heck of a time cutting the top off. It was insane, I was actually sweating & I work out. Pie pumpkins have a very very VERY hard shell I learned. That's what makes a carving pumpkin different. Aide from that fiasco, everything else was great!! Would make again... Using a small carving pumpkin ??

After reading a lot of conflicting reviews, I decided to just stick to the recipe & everyone loved it! Served it with apple slices, graham crackers & cinnamon sugar pita chips. I will definitely make again!

I have made this several times and always get rave reviews.  I like using the cheesecake flavor of pudding if you can find it and serve it with cinnamon graham crackers.

Love this, it's light, and super easy.  I slather it on thick on the Down east Maine pumpkin bread from this site, and it makes an awesome dessert.  I've also used it to ice a boxed spice cake mix, then drizzled with caramel ice cream topping, and guests thought I slaved over dessert.  Can't enjoy pumpkin bread without this dip on it anymore, it seems dry and plain. Thank you for sharing.

I liked this recipe, I would suggest tasting it as you add the whipped topping until it is as you would like. I ended up adding not quite all of the whipped topping and thought it was great with sliced apples and ginger snaps!

Super easy to make and delicious! I made the recipe exactly as called for and it was a great choice. I considered using the larger size of pumpkin and extra vanilla but I am glad I didn't. This recipe made a lot just as it was. I took it to family party and everyone loved it. I served it with granny smith apples and cinnamon graham crackers.

This was very good but next time  I would add 1/4 less whipped topping.  I've taken the leftovers and frozen them thinking it will thaw out and be an easy party or Thanksgiving treat.

Great, but any way to make thicker?

Is there a replacement for the Jello pudding mix its sugar, cornstarch, flavor, salt, thickening and chemicals?  Could cornstarch, brown sugar, natural vanilla, other be used for a healthier mix?

I followed this recipe exactly how it was written. I did use fat free whipped topping though. It is DELICIOUS! A great seasonal snack. I am bringing it to an adult Halloween party but my 3 teenagers liked it too so I will make it again for them! We are going as Ted (the movie) & Thunder Buddies for life partner so we bough cinnamon flavored teddy grahams to go with the dip!

After adding half the cool whip I decided not to add the rest. I'm glad I didn't. It doesn't have a very strong pumpkin flavor. More than anything I taste the pudding mix and the cool whip. If I made it again, which I might, I would probably double the pumpkin and the spices.

Made a half batch because I wasn't sure if we would like it; however, no concerns there...it is FABULOUS!!!  Cut everything in half, subbing small sugar-free vanilla pudding and small container of lite cool whip.  Served it on top of maple pancakes and the kids devoured it & said it was the best breakfast I ever made.   Easy, versatile, delicious & refreshing change...definitely try this one, you won't regret it!

Instead of graham crackers I buy Sara Lee frozen pound cake and slice it up on long dipping strips.  It works best if the pound cake is frozen when you cut it up.  Awesome recipe!!!

Yum, yum, yum!!  I made this for a holiday party and it was a big hit!  I doubled the pumpkin and used cheesecake pudding, but it was very tasty!  We had leftovers that didn't fit in the pumpkin "bowl" and they lasted for a week just fine.

This is the PERFECT autumn dessert. I did everything exactly as listed, except I added a tiny bit more cinnamon. It was wonderful and a big hit! I served this with a box of cinnamon sticks (graham crackers work too) but the box was quickly devoured. I should have bought two boxes instead of one! There was plenty of dip left over since I ran out of crackers. But that's okay, more for me ;) If you love fall and everything pumpkin, please make this. You will be glad you did. As my boyfriend says "I'm so glad you're my girlfriend because I get to take the leftovers home!"

I used 8 oz Cool Whip instead of 16 oz. It can out much better. It was a hit at Thanksgiving. Served it with apple slices and ginger wafers.

Made this the first time for a Fall get together.  Was a big hit.  Served with plain animal crackers and cinnamon graham crackers.  Good Stuff.  Will make every fall going forward or even for football games!

I made this recipe just as written except that I only used the typical sized box of vanilla pudding by mistake. We all loved it with graham crackers- kids and adults alike! This will certainly be one I make many times again. Thanks for sharing!

This was very tasty! The only things I changed were adding a bit more pumpkin pie spice and decreasing the amount of whipped cream (adding until dip had a nice consistency and flavor).

This recipe was super easy and I agree with another reviewer, if you are the least bit interested, go ahead and try it!  I did not like this as a dip because it didn't have the consistency of a typical dip.  I felt like I was eating a topping or the inside of a doughnut.  It did taste good though, so I think it would be a great filling in a puff pastry shell or for a winter pumpkin version of strawberry shortcake or in a doughnut.  It might even be good as a light topping on some sort of cider or tea.

Very nice. I followed the recipe except for using French Vanilla flavored Cool Whip and making my own pumpkin spice mix. I was probably a little heavy on the spices because I like spicy. Other than that, it is good and although good with apples, I, too, prefer it with the cinnamon graham crackers.

Love love love!!! My husband bought the canned pumpkin pie filling by accident and oh my! So good! Next time I made it I used regular pie filling. I have to say I like it with the pie filling better. Sweeter. But both ways are good!!

Did not care for this recipe.  Took to a social function where I served with ginger bread and shortbread cookies.  While sampled, I took home most of the recipe.  I served the next day at a smaller gathering (with no other sweets) and again, sampled but not the hit of the group.

Easy, fast and tastes delicious!   Plus, for all of you eating gluten-free, if you buy Kraft Jell-O in the U.S. it's GF.  Perfect for a last-minute dessert or pot luck.

This is a happy addition to my recipe box. We enjoyed this with Apple slices and very thin ginger crisps (Anne's, they come in a small rectangular box and I can always find them at ShopRite stores in the gourmet cookie section. They are inexpensive but you don't get too many in the box. But they are perfect for this dip). I have made this 2 or 3 times, playing around with the ingredients.

This makes a lot and I was worried that some of it might go to waste.  I should never have worried!  The whole family agrees that it's best with cinnamon grahams (or by the spoonful).

Made this yesterday. Must say I was very impressed . Love pumpkin pie without the crust and what better to have a fluffy texture that tastes just like it!! Had it with cinnamon graham crackers. In love!

I made the recipe as directed although I reserved 1 1/2 cup cool whip, and put it into a pie pan with a vanilla wafer crust then topped with cool whip, sprinkled with crushed vanilla wafers and sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice... It was soo good and soo easy!

I used fresh pumpkin and this was sooo easy. It was a big hit at home and at work. Excellent with ginger snaps, graham crackers, and apple slices. I only used 1 8 oz package of cool whip and i used the sugar free vareity.

This stuff is yummy. Very light and refreshing. Only thing I did differently from the recipe was I didn't fold in the whipped topping. I used a handmixer when I added the whipped cream so I was sure to get a smooth consistency. Served w/ apples, ginger snaps, and cinnamon graham crackers.

Loved this!  It was a huge hit at our Halloween party.  I made a few modifications: 1) Used about 3/4 of the whipped cream.  I wanted it to be thicker and more "pumpkiny" and 2) Used about double the pumpkin spice (did it to taste).  The flavors were perfect.  I served with ginger snaps from Trader Joe's.  Yum!

I substituted the seasonal Jello Pumpkin Spice instant pudding for the vanilla, and it gave the dip a good flavor boost. I also added about 4 oz of cream cheese to this recipe. It is easy to put together, and is always popular at my office potlucks in the cooler weather.

This was delicious and very easy. I followed the recipe but then added more pumpkin pie spice. It tasted even better the next day. Very good with cinnamon graham crackers. My 13-year-old son loved it!

I did this last night for our Halloween Party with Scooby Snacks (bone shaped graham crackers)  It was cute and many enjoyed it.  I was suggested to also use Nilla Wafers or Lorna Doone crackers with it.  I personally don;t like pumpkin, but I tired it and thought it wasn't have bad.

This dip is really great with apples too! However it needs a little more spice because to me the flavor was too light.

I have made this 3 times now and love it each time.  I use the fat free sugar free cool whip and the fat free sugar free vanilla instant pudding though.  Trying to cut the calories and still have a treat.

What a simple, but tasty dip!  My husband says its like a mini bite of pumpkin pie.  I used only 8oz. of Cool Whip so I decreased the vanilla pudding, but kept the same pumpkin.  Makes lots!

I went back and forth with how to rate this recipe. Everyone who tried it loved it...it really does taste like pumpkin pie. That being said, it does not look appetizing at ALL, so most people were afraid to try it! I added vanilla extract as someone else suggested, along with Heath bits, and everyone liked that addition.

I made this dip for our annual Halloween party and served it in a carved smaller pumkin and it was a huge hit! I also served it with bone shaped cinnamon graham crackers I found at the grocery store.  I'll definitely make this again!

This dip is amazing! I have to admit, I was a bit critical of the simple ingredients and was worried about the texture, but mine came out wonderful! Surprisingly creamy and delicious. This is definitely going to be a fall staple at my home.

I made this recipe for an autumn themed baby shower and everyone loved it.  They couldn't believe there wasn't cream cheese in it.  I served it with cut apples, but it tastes so much like pumpkin pie filling, I think it would be great to fill a graham cracker pie crust with it and serve as a frozen pie.  Excellent recipe!

Very easy to make! Pretty good! Because I bought the wrong size I used 8oz whip topping and 3.5 oz package of vanilla pudding. Also used cinnamon and ginger because I was out of pumpkin pie spice. I will try to make again and wondering if pumpkin spice will make a difference. Also I think 16 oz container  of whip topping  could possibly loose the pumpkin flavor? Had the dip w/ cinnamon graham crackers and would like to try with vanilla wafers.

This was fantastic!!!  It tasted just like a creamier pumpkin pie.  I made a few changes, I didn't use pumpkin pie spice, just a little bit of cinnamon and a tiny, miniscule amount of ginger, both of which are in pumpkin pie spice.  I hollowed out a pie pumpkin and served it in there, accompanied with scooby doo scooby snack graham crackers, since I couldn't find the little sticks they usually sell in grocery stores.  Everyone raved over it, and I keep having people ask me for the recipe!

***I changed my recipe but only because I had to!!! I didn't realize I had to give stars - I was going to not rate it since I had changed it.  Anyways, I could not find canned pumpkin at ANY of my local grocers.  So, since I was in a hurry and needed a substitute I bought a large can of yams and pureed them and added pumpkin pie spice.  It turned out awesome.    I got lots of compliments on it, even from picky eaters.  A woman came up to me and said "I have to have this recipe, my son is the pickiest eater and he is loving this!"  Hopefully I'll be finding some canned pumpkin and ripe pumpkins as the fall season is closing in here and I will definitely be making this all the time!!

It was ok, not terrible, but would not make it again.  A few of the kids liked it, most of the adults had a taste, but no more.

I just loved this dip. It was taken to a Christmas party along with gingerbread boy cookies from this site. They loved it at the party. This makes a lot, so used the rest for the filling and frosting on a pumpkin spice cake from this site. It was great. Don't miss out on trying this.

I made this to take to our Thanksgiving family dinner...it was a hit! I served in a small glass pumpkin, surrounded by Pumpkin Bread IV off this site. Great presentation! I mis-read the recipe and only purchased 1 (8 oz) container of coolwhip. It still tasted great:) Thanks for sharing!

Wowza! This stuff is awesome! It tastes like I am eating pumpkin pie. I used fat free cool whip and fat free vanilla instant pudding mix. It turned out fantastic! I served it with apples b/c one person had a wheat allergy in the party, but next time i'm serving it will cinnamon  gramm crackers. This dish is a keeper!!!

This is a treasure for diabetics or for dieting -- use sugar free instant pudding and sugar free Coolwhip.  A fantastic dessert or snack as well.

This is delicious! Unfortunately the grocery store was out of pumpkin puree and fresh pumpkins due to a shortage. I used sweet potatoes instead and it was fantastic. Think I would probably like it better than with pumpkin. Very easy to make.

I added a bit of vanilla extract and served with gingersnaps, vanilla wafers, and graham crackers.  This was a major hit at my Halloween party!  Everyone was kind of surprised at how much they liked it, even non-pumpkin lovers!
Update: This has become my signature dish that people request I bring! It's definitely a crowd-pleaser!

Sweet, light, pumpkin pie filling flavor.  Be sure to make it at least 8 hours ahead of time to allow the pudding mix granules and the spices time to break down, otherwise, there's a bit of graininess. Also, with time, the spice flavors become more intense. This defintely tasted better a day and a half after mixing it up than it did the same day.

Yummy stuff! Super easy & my kid's loved it as well.The only thing i changed was that i used light topping and it was an 8oz container & no sugar pudding.Still turned out great! I will be making this again during Thanksgiving! A lower calorie dip i can serve with fruit,that is excellent!This is just what i was looking for.Thanks for a great recipe :)

This recipe was very easy and very delicious! It makes a lot so I took some to work and had cinnamon grahams for dipping. Everyone loved it and wanted a copy of the recipe. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. I would suggest trying to find the cinnamon graham STICKS but regular works fine too.

Fluffy, airy, sweet and delicious! Tastes just like pumpkin pie with whipped cream. I served with cinnamon graham crackers, but it would be good with almost anything . . . . honey grahams, nilla wafers, gingersnaps, etc. Great appetizer or dessert for fall.

This was awesome!  I added a drizzle of butterscotch scnapps but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with spiced wafer cookies and apple slices.  A Keeper!

I took it to a party and everyone loved it! However, the next time I make it, I will add extra spice as recommended by jennabeanski. Could use a little more flavor. I will be making this again real soon!

Wonderful light dip with graham sticks, nilla wafers, pretzels and apples.  Those are all the things I tried it with and it was delicious.  Big hit with both adults and kids.  I made the pumpkin puree from scratch and used it in my batch...so good!

I followed the directions exactly.  It tastes good, but not much pumpkin flavor.  Next time I will either use a small container of whipped topping or the larger can of pumpkin.

Very interesting flavor that kept me coming back for more.  I only used 1/2 of the cool whip (all I had) and a smaller package of the pudding.  Will probably make again.

Sorry - this is a good recipe, but it's just so ugly I can't picture making it again.  When you have a bar full of appetizers, pies and cakes,this one just gets passed over because of it's looks.

I absolutely love this dip. I made it for my Halloween party and everyone thought it was unique. The color was a little strange but it was all gone and I was licking the bowl! Delicious! Great served with graham crackers or ginger snaps. This is definetly a keeper.

This was very easy to make and a big hit for fall football parties as an easy dessert.  It is nice because you can make it ahead of time and then just pull it out when you are ready to serve.  I served it with apple slices and cinnamon graham crackers, everyone preferred the freshness of the apples with it.  The dip is very good but super sweet, borderline kid's sugary sweet but none of the kids really liked the pumpkin.  I served it to people who love sugary sweets so it was fine, but personally a little bit of this went a very long way for me.  Delicious, but I only put a tiny bit of dip on my apples and crackers.

I have also done this pumpkin fluff with a trifle.  I used ginger snaps, pumpkin fluff and cool whip.  Always a hit.  I also sprinkle cinnamon on top, and have decorated in a pumpkin with bats and spiders for Halloween.

I thought this was a very nice way to get the taste of pumpkin pie in a dip!  I used non-fat Cool Whip and added 4 packets of Splenda.

I made this for a party and everyone liked it a lot.  I used fat free cool whip - no one could tell...I also used ginger snap cookies because I could not find the little bite sized grahms...and they tasted pretty good.  Nilla Wafers sound good with it too....

I used a large can of pumpkin pie filling instead of the packed pumpkin, and also omitted the pumpkin spice. I took this to a fall party and everyone raved about it. I had about 5 people ask me for the recipe before i left that night.

This was very good. It made a big batch.  NExt time I would 1/2 it.  I did take someone's advice and double the pumpkin so instead of a 15 oz. can I put in the large can and loved it this way. THe next time I will use a 8 oz. whipped cream and a 15 oz. pumpkin to make it alittle smaller.

This was so incredibly easy to make, and everyone loved it.  I used cheesecake flavored pudding mix per a previous reviewer's suggestion, and since I didn't have pumpkin pie spice (I don't like pumpkin pie) I just used a mixture of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg instead.  I also used the reduced fat cool whip to make it a little more appealing to those who are dieting before the big Thanksgiving Day pig-out.  I was asked by several people for the recipe and plan on making again and again.  Also, I only took half to work (it makes A LOT), and the rest held up really well in the fridge for a week before being eaten up.

I make this every holiday season and everyone always asks for the recipe!  Sometimes I make a lower sugar version for my diabetic mom with sugar free pudding and light whipped topping...no one can tell the difference!  It still gets gobbled up!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving.  It looked like an easy yummy recipe. It was such a hit, everyone was asking for the recipe! :)  I used alittle more Cool whip to make it not so thick, and used way more pumpkin spice than the recipe called for to make it real flavorful.  Oh, and I used Cheesecake jello flavor instead of Vanilla.  What a yummy, easy recipe!!  :)

This was very good, and went quickly at a baby shower I hosted! The pudding mix I picked up wasn't as big as the recipe called for, but by the time I realized it, it was too late. It was still delicious! I will make this often! Thanks.

I served this out of a Jack-O-Lantern for a Halloween party. I served it with Ginger Snaps. I did add more spice to it- cinnamon,nutmeg,clove,ginger. YUMMY- everyone loved it young & young at heart. Went great with the Hot apple cider.

This was very easy to make & good. If you don't like pie crust, this recipe combines the flavor of pumpkin pie and whipped cream into one.  I combined with graham cracker sticks & there was nothing left.

SOOOO good! I bought 1 1oz package of pudding instead of 1 5oz package of pudding in error.  I ended up using the 1 package of pudding plus about 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  I also used my own spices: allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg and a little salt instead of pumpkin pie spice.  Made this the night before.  Everyone loved it!  Wonder if this would work with Splenda.

Well, i thought that this was very good and i loved the presentation when served in a little pumpkin...but i'm only giving it 4 stars, because nobody else at the party seemed to think it was as good as i did.  you know, they had a bite here or there, but i didn't hear any rave reviews and after the party, i ended up throwing most of it away :( i thought it tasted like fluffy bites of pumpkin pie!  of course, i really, really love pumpkin pie, maybe that's the difference!

Great recipe!  The presentation is festive and the dip is delicious.  My kids loved and so did my husband who isn't really a big fan of pumpkin.  I liked ginger snaps best for dipping.  I will DEFINITELY be making this for years to come!!

Great fall recipe!!!  I have found it is great served with "sugar cookie" sticks.  I just buy the dough and roll it out,  sprinkle with a little cinnimon and sugar then cut with a pizza cutter.  My family loves it.

I took this dip to work for a Horror D'Oeuvres lunch and everyone loved it. The ginger snaps were a particular hit. I preferred the apples myself but I'm not a ginger snap fan. I've been asked to share the recipe with everyone that was there. Thanks for this super easy and delicious recipe. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was so great and so easy. It makes for a very festive dish when served in a pumpkin - thanks for the idea! I sprinkled the top with some cinnamon and nutmeg and served with cinnamon Teddy Grahams and Granny Smith apples. I'm not even a pumpkin fan, but thought this was tasty. Would definitely make again for any fall event!

Yummy and festive.  Many wanted the recipe.  I think next time I'll try it with less cool whip and more pumpkin like others have suggested.  Definitely quick and easy.  Thanks!

The dip is really good, but I made a few minor adjustments.  I only added about 3/4 of the cool whip, since it was gradually starting to lost its pumpkin flavor.  I also doubled the amount of pumpkin spice and added a little sugar.  The dip was a huge, huge hit at our fall party.  Next time, I think I'm going to add a little cream cheese to it and it will be delicious!

This was so good and soooo easy. I added 2 cans of pumpkin and extra spice... I just kept adding till it tasted right. I served it with ginger snaps... the perfect addition to the recipe because ginger is a pumpkin pie spice! Nobody at the party knew what this orange dip served with ginger snaps was, so I just started walking around with a few cookies loaded with the pumpkin dip and as I walked up to a guest I told them to open their mouths and I just shoveled it in :)


They kinda expect that from me by now hahaha. They LOVED IT! Everyone wanted the recipe!

My 11 year old daughter made this for a fall potluck at our campground.  She served in in a hollowed out pie pumpkin with chocolate and cinnamon Teddy Grahams. It was a absolute hit!  We have a pregnant friend who smeared it in the middle of two homemade chocolate chip cookies... OMG!  Fun!!!

We had a luncheon at my place of work the other day & I wanted something quick, easy & different.  This recipe is all that & so much more!  People were literally standing over the dip eating it & they couldn't stop! The only way we could get it away from one person was to put it in the refrigerator for the next day..lol.  I've passed this recipe on to at least 4 people & have made extra copies just in case.  This is a great recipe & I can't wait to try the different variations that other members have suggested.  Especially the cheesecake pudding!

Delicious!  I'm also giving it five stars because it is soooo quick and easy and requires so few ingredients.  I used SF-FF pudding mix.  I served it with graham crackers but I think it would also be great with ginger snaps like others have tried.  It might even be good with chocolate graham crackers.

This is incredible!  I used 1 3.4 box vanilla pudding mix and 1 3.4 box cheesecake pudding mix and increased the whipped topping to 20 ounces (I used Cool Whip Free, which worked great). I made this for a food day at work.  Everyone raved and I had a lot of requests for the recipe.  Thanks for posting!

YUMM!! DELICIOUS!! This recipe makes a TON so I recommend cutting it in half unless you plan on feeding about 50 people with it. Half the recipe would easily serve 20-30 as an appetizer. I served it with cinnamon graham sticks. It was a hit!

You have to try this recipe!! This is the recipe that I have had requests for the most!  Whenever I take it anywhere everyone always asks for the recipe.  I make it as is, with a little sprinkle of nutmeg on top and serve it with cinnamon graham stix and apple slices.  After reading some reviews, I am going to try the cheesecake pudding next time.

I received this recipe from a friend, and I have to say that this is, hands down, one of the best dips ever!  I find that it is requested ALL THE TIME whenever people are getting together!  This goes great with either graham crackers of Ginger snaps, and if you use Cool Whip, is non-dairy so as not to cause stomach upset for those that are lactose intolerant.

This fluff is very tasty! I chose to serve it with cinnamon graham crackers but those just seemed to be too thick and overpowering for the fluff; almost as if the fluff needed to be just a little bit more dense...maybe I will make some adjustments to the fluff or try something else to serve it with.

I made this dip for my class finals, and no one ate it. I think it was because it looked spicy, rather than sweet. I think it's delicious! I'm planning on turning it into a pie--yum!

I only have a question - I wonder if it would work to use pumpkin flavored instant pudding and skip the pumpkin pie spice? Anyone tried this? Thanks so much.

This was dip amazing--and amazingly easy to make. Great texture and wonderful flavor. I served it with gingersnaps, but my guests kept commenting that you could just eat it by itself straight out of the bowl. Very unique--I will definitely make this again.

This was really easy, and everyone liked it.  The recipe confused me though.  The instant pudding size didn't correspond, so I think I used much less than I was supposed to, and I used half the cool whip, but it didn't seem to matter. I used the cheesecake flavored pudding mix too.  Served it with Cinnamon Graham Cracker sticks, which pair nicely.

Very Easy. I used both ginger snap cookies and graham cracker sticks. I put some of both of those at the bottom of the dip and when the dip is gone the cookies are soft and very yummy!

This is a great dip.  I'd recommend using half the suggested amount of whipped topping, as using a full tub drowned out the pumpkin flavor a bit. Next time, I'll use less.  Otherwise, excellent!!!

Made this recipe for my office Halloween party and it was a big hit.  I did not have pumkpin spice so I used trader joes chai mix (2 teas.)instead and it turned out wonderful. I also added the vanilla.  This is quick, easy, light and lowfat.  Can't wait to make it for the holiday!

This dip was very good paired with Pumpkin bread.  I added a little extra pumpkin.  I had very little time to put this together so I appreciate how quickly I was able to put it together.

This was a big hit.  So simple to make.  I didn't have vanilla pudding on hand so I used white chocolate.  This recipe makes a ton so cutting back on the Cool Whip is necessary.

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie so I'm rating this recipe based on other's comments and actions.  Everyone seemed to like and did rave about it but I only gave it 4 stars because of the amount left.  I did serve it in a Saran Wrap lined pumpkin and got big kudos for that.  Taking others' advice, I halved the Cool Whip but, other than that, made it just as written.

Does taste like pumpkin pie without the shell.  Made for treat day at work and didn't really get eaten, bought over half of it home. :(  Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so followed the direction on the pumpkin can for the amount of spices to add.  Served with both ginger snaps and graham cracker sticks.  Giving four stars, as my daughter really like it.  But otherwise would give it only three stars.

just OKAY. Nothing spectacular, tastes like Cool Whip and pumpkin. I served these with cinnamon graham cracker sticks and the taste of those totally overpowered the dip. In fact, everyone that tasted them said, "whats in this, cool whip and pumpkin?" I was like, "uhh yeah and vanilla pudding mix too...". Not sure I'd make it again, unless I was really tied up for time and needed something quick.

Wow, this is some darn good stuff!  I couldn't wait to make it when I found this recipe!  We served with gingersnaps.  Could also easily be a pie filling in a graham cracker crust.  So excellent!

This is a fantastic dip that has never failed to get compliments. I recommend serving it with cinnamon-sugar flavored tortilla chips for a very tasting treat!

Loved it! I also used less Whipped Topping, somewhere between 8oz and the 12oz container. I used lite whipped topping. I took it to our goodie night at Bible Study and everyone agreed that it was great. I also brought to work and it was GONE! I served with both graham cracker sticks and Ginger snaps....I liked the Ginger snap combo. I will make this again.

This was pretty good.  Depends on how sweet you like things.  I'm a sugarholic, so this was pretty boring for me.  Others that aren't so sweet-oriented loved it, though.  I actually took it one step further in my desperate attempt to make it sweeter and added chopped semi-sweet morsels to it.  Not too bad.

This was good although I didn't think the flavor was all that strong.  I think if I make it again I will use less whipped topping.

I made this for a large family function and it was a huge hit!  I chose about four different things you could dip into it and they loved it!  The pumpkin taste isn't overhwhelming and its not too sweet.  I loved it!

Love this recipe. I didn't add the whole container of whipped topping, I actually bought an 8 oz container by accident, and still didn't use the whole thing. I tasted as I added until it was to my liking. Too much would have takien away from the pumpkin taste. Yiu could even put this in a graham crust and serve as a pie. I served with graham sticks, delish.

What a hit!  I served with cinnamon graham cracker sticks and also pumpkin bread. 

I think this could also be used on as a frosting.

I did add a little extra pumpkin spice

Absolutely delicious!!  I've served with the Cinnamon graham sticks and Teddy Grahams for kids.  Perfect for any fall gathering.  I plan to use for a kids' Halloween party and a Thanksgiving appetizer.

Everyone loved it! I didn't have all the pumpkin pie spices, so I just used a few shakes of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also used cinnamon graham cracker sticks (as other reviwers suggested). Make sure the whipped topping is thawed for better presentation! The first time I made it was a bit mushy looking instead of fluffy. Still tastes great either way.

Excellent and easy!  I was asked several times for the recipe.  I served with cinnamon graham cracker sticks (scooby snacks) and apples.  There was a lot left, so I took it to another party the next day and it was just as good!

SUPER TASTY. At one party, I ran out of Nilla Wafers before the fluff dip ran out, so guests grabbed spoons and finished it off! (Okay, we weren't quite sober, but it was still a hit!!!)

Half the recipe is more than enough though.

Yummy. It really taste like pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top. I didn't win at the meeting I went to but everyone said it was really good. Thanks. Oh, and I used less whipped cream than called for per other reviews.

I made this recipe for a family reunion, and the kids loved it! 
I did cut back on the whipped topping, to 12 oz, and found it to be perfect.
We used cinnamon graham crackers AND gingersnaps for dipping..FABULOUS!!

Oh My God- SO good- took like 5 seconds to make- Like others, I pared down the cool whip (i used light) and instead of using 16 oz, I used 12- I didn't have pumpkin pie spice (and I hate the ginger in it) so i added some cinnamon and nutmeg-- I topped the dip with a shot of cinnamon which added a nice color to it.. Just served it at a party with graham cracker sticks and granny smith apple-- HUGE hit and people wanted the recipe-- People were excited about how easy it was to make...

Everyone that tried this absolutely loved this.  I do not like pumpkin, so I was a little scared to try-but I did and LOVED it.

Very easy to make - kid friendly, but I think I prefer the recipe for Pumpkin Dip better - it tastes more like pumpkin pie - this one is VERY Cool Whippy - still good, but not a 5 star in my books without revisions.

This is a fantastic, simple recipe! Great for fall.

I made it for a party, it was gone in twenty minutes. I made it again for a potluck, and am making it AGAIN for another potluck. SO GOOD!

This recipe was so easy, even my special need students made this... and then I made it for a party that I was throwing at my house tonight and was asked for it by 3 people that don't like pumpkin.. Great and easy recipe... Only changes I made was I used only 8oz of whipped topping and used half of can pumpkin pie filling and omited pumpkin spice, but it was great..

This was a big hit at work, and it's so easy to make! I made a few modifications: only used about half of the cool-whip, a bit more pumpkin pie spice and added a splash of pure vanilla, then sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top. Great with the cinnamon graham sticks. Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't totally wowed by it, but my coworkers loved it!  I had to give the recipe out to a bunch of people.  I used less whipped topping than called for and it went over best with the cinnamon graham cracker sticks.  A perfect fall treat for a potluck!

I made this for a get together and it was a huge hit. Made it with pumpkin pie filling (instead of the solid pack pumpkin) and didn't add extra spices. Served it with soft ginger snaps. Many people asked for the recipe!

I have made this recipe for about 10 years, but I have always known it as Creamy Pumpkin Pie.  I am asked to bring it to Thanksgiving dinner every year because everyone loves it so much.  I just take the filling and put it in a pre-baked pie crust.  It is wonderful.  I am going to take this version of it to a Halloween Party.  Can't wait to try it!  I am sure everyone will love it! Try it as a pie sometime.

This is a quick and easy to make, delicious treat! You will ALWAYS be asked for the recipe. A huge hit at potlucks and an easy crowd pleaser to bring when you're short on time and still want to wow them. I use the graham cracker dipping stix and it tastes just like pumpkin pie.

This a great dip! Very unusual...kind of like eating pumpkin pie with your fingers. It went over very well during Thanksgiving and Christmas with all of the pumpkin pie lovers. It does make a really large amount of dip so you may want to downsize.

Yummm!  My youngest son loves anything made with pumpkin so I let him make this with my guidance.  Easy as pie and it tasted great!  He claimed the pumpkin fluff dip as his contribution to our Thanksgiving table from this year on.

Easy to prepare. I reduced the amount of whipped topping and also used only a 3-ounce package of instant pudding. Also didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I just added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. It is sort of a mousse and think I might serve this in parfait glasses topped with a little sprinkling of cinnamon.

This is really good.  We served it with the Big Soft Ginger Cookies (recipe on this site) and, while those cookies are really soft and it's hard to dip, the flavors together are wonderful.  I'll bet it would be good on graham crackers too, as the submitter stated.  Truthfully, I could just sit and eat spoonful after spoonful of this stuff.  It's that good!!  It does make a lot.  Thanks for sharing this one!

My family and friends want to give this recipe ten stars. Everyone argues at family gatherings about who gets to take some home with them! We used this recipe at our wedding reception with (hehe!!) Scooby Doo Graham Snacks. I think it was the only thing we ran out of at our buffet. Delicious!

I actually made the pudding instead of just the "mix" by mistake but it turned out great! Probably thicker than it was supposed to be but my guests ate it up. And the cinnamon crackers were a great idea.

This was very easy and very good. I added some Vanilla Sugar (from Penzey's Spices) for a little more flavor. You could just add some vanilla extract too. It does make almost 2 cool whip bowls full.

I served with pound cake and angel food cake like individual trifles with a scoop of whip cream on top and they were a hit. I used just cinnamon in place of pumpkin pie spice and it turned out great.

This was OK.  It was so light that it was almost like a very faint pumpkin flavored whip cream

I've made this several times to bring into the office (the perfect winter treat in the cold New England weather)  and they keep asking when I am going to do it again!  I used fat/free or lite ingredients when I could and served it with ginger snaps from Trader Joe's... it's always gobbled right up!

Great stuff. Always get asked for the recipe. However; it does make a large amount.  I used Gingersnaps.  Really enjoy it at my annual Halloween party.

This stuff is sooo good!! Great with Nilla Wafers. The recipe makes A LOT, though. Next time I'll probably half it.

This recipe was a real pleaser for everyone at our New Years Eve Party! I had lots of requests for the recipe. I agree that the cinnamon grahams were best!

FANTASTIC! So simple but to die for - my friends just loved it and everyone was shocked to find that pumpkin could be so good. I will certainly make this again and again. CB

This is a really good dip for autumn and the holidays.  I made it for a shower in June and it didn't go over big but I really think it would be a hit at Thanksgiving.

I thought this was so scrumptious.  It it so fast and delicious.  I took it to two places as it made quite a bit.  I made homemade cinnamon bread and it they all loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't like this, although I really didn't expect to as pumpkin is not my favorite.  The members of my book club left it almost untouched, however.  In all fairness, I did serve lots of other yummy food, so it may have lost by default.

Yummy! Made this for Thanksgiving and served with ginger snaps and cinnamon graham sticks. Family loved this! I used 1 small tub of lite cool whip and it was perfect. A keeper!
