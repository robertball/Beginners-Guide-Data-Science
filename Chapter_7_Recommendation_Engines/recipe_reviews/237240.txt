Delicious and unique tasting.  The flavors are complex and satisfying.  This is a great meal to have when you want a dish that stands out from the rest. I substituted beef broth, but will use chicken broth (as per the recipe) next time because I think it will give a more subtle flavor.

This is the first time I have rated and reviewed any of the many dishes from Allrecipes that we have used. This reminded me of the south of France. The only thing that I question is what to do with the remainder of the olive brine after adding the 2 tbsps? The next time I plan on keeping the bones in the breast and see what that adds to the dish.
Thank you Chef John!

Wonderful!  I was super skeptical but made this anyway.  It was really a rich wonderful flavor. I would expect this from an expensive itailan restaurant.

The chicken was amazing - lot of flavor, but the amount of olives was probably too much. Next time, I would halve the olives, but still use the brine. Thanks to this recipe, I've discovered Herbes de Provence, which are lovely.

I made this recipe and followed Chef Johns instructions without any changes. My husband and I loved it!!! We served it over rice, but we think it would taste awesome over couscous too. Our 6 year old picky eater didn't eat the olives but enjoyed the chicken on its own. I will definitely be cooking this again! Very unique taste.

This was FANTASTIC!!! I cut up a whole chicken because that's what I had it cooked accordingly. I also had garlic stuffed green olives which brought a nice additional extra something. I used a splash of vermouth to deglaze the pan as well. This is def going into the rotation.

Loved it like all of Chef John's recipes!  It'll be in the rotation for sure.  Next time, for me, a little more cayenne and a nice baguette to soak up some of that goodness.

Did not love it, but was ok.  Followed recipe exactly and served over cous cous.  Probably won't make again. My husband said it smelled better than it tasted.

Chicken was wonderful!!  What a great combination of flavors.  The only change I made was using boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I paired with roasted garlic couscous. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

It was good - I made a few changes - I substituted chicken wings for the breast - breast is too dry for me. I also substituted the stock for white wine.  I added mushrooms and artichoke hearts and added a little cream to the sauce to richen it.  I served over pasta.  Came out awesome!

I had to improvise (a lot) so it really wasn’t the same dish. I gave it 5 stars based on the original recipe bc even tho I haven’t tried it yet I’m positive it will be awesome! I’m a huge olive fan so I can just imagine. Cooking method is on point & I was able to adapt easily. I used Italian seasoning, rosemary, & paprika instead of herbes de Provence. Regular onions instead of shallots. And wait for it- pepperchinis instead of olives. Also added feta to the sauce- which didn’t look very pretty but it still turned out delicious!!

Wow, I normally don't like kalamata olives, but in this dish they are wonderful! Chef John nails it yet again! He's right, the sauce and the chicken by themselves aren't very special. But together, it's magic. My husband raved about this one and he's sick of chicken!

This recipe with layers of flavours truly elevated the chicken breast.  Unfortunately my chicken was skinless.  I did not change the recipe, just doubled it.  I had a garden party for eight  friends (major critics) I sliced the chicken and poured the delicious sauce over it.  Every one of those women were delighted and loved the combination of the flavours.  Chef John will be happy to hear, I gave him all the credit.  THANKS !

Between the green olives, kalamata olives, and the brine, we found the recipe to be extremely salty. The zest and juice of the lemon added another level of imbalance.  Won't be doing this one again.

Okay! If you have not tried a Chef John recipe, then you must! He is amazing! I have yet to find a bad one! This one is perfect! Watch Chef John make it first. Listen carefully, he often gives words of encouragement and important dos and don'ts. This one requires a tiny bit of work, but you will NOT be disappointed!

Excellent!  Never would have paired olives with chicken but the flavors were outstanding together.  Leftovers even made a mean sandwich!  With just the two of us, we halved the meat but retained the measurements for the sauce.  Chicken breasts that we used were too thick, so 2nd time around, we filleted the breast to cut down on cooking time.  Definitely a keeper and well worth the prep time!

I did not care for the flavor of the chicken with the brine. Maybe I put in too much but I was expecting exciting things and this was just OK.  Next up is Chef John's Chicken Kiev.  It looks soooo good.

I am eating this while reviewing. I did not have all the ingredients at hand so made it with chicken thighs and no lemon and it is still delicious. I’ll make it next time with all the ingredients and I’m sure it will be even better.

Thought it might be too salty but it came out great! Got to learn how to debone split breasts to get the chicken parts, too. New skill level!

As  huge olive fans this dish was perfect for us and the briney flavors offset a rich earthy savory bread pudding with mushrooms and roasted red peppers perfectly.

My husband and I both loved this dish.  The only change I made was to add some xantham powder to make the sauce a little thicker (I'm keto so, dish needed to "stand" on its own)  Will absolutely make again!

I have made this several times and it’s a family favorite.  Currently I use 5-6 boneless skinless chicken thighs and add the herbes de Provence with the olives.   I leave everything else the same.  It’s just an amazing combination of flavors!

FANTASTIC dish!  I made the chicken the night before but the sauce the day I was serving this awesome recipe!!  Does not take long to make at all, especially if you can make the chicken the night previous. I  served it over spaghetti with zucchini on the side.  Make the sauce, the day of serving pour over the chicken and put in oven for about 15-20 minutes. This could also be done the night previous and all would be ready for dinner the next night. I would add rolls, or garlic bread next time, but is certainly filling.  I also baked 

the zucchini squash in the oven while the casserole was heating thru!  Absolutely delicious.  I also combined the green olives with Kalamata olives just for color and a little more brine!  Everyone liked it very much.  Quick, easy dish, and great for pot lucks or any time.

Delish.  I thought the sauce was a bit sharp so i added a little heavy cream that toned it down.  Served with mashed pots.

I made this recipe exactly as Chef John suggested, except I used boneless, skinless, thighs, instead of breasts. As with most of Chef John's recipes, this did not disappoint. I'll make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Prepared this dish as written, and because I love the flavor-pairing of olives with chicken, it was delicious. The briny olives complimented the white chicken breasts very well. Served it with a crusty white bread to soak up the juices.

How divine!  This was definitely be hitting my table again.  I loved the flavor even before I added the butter.  I substitute the olive oil for coconut oil, so I'm not sure if that made much of a flavor difference, but still made it into a fantastic dish!
