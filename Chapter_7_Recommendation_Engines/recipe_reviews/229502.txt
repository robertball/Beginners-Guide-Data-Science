This was SO GOOD!! I did add some lime juice as to the recipe along with the lemon juice, and then just before serving I sprinkled fresh cilantro on top! I will definitely make this again!

This was a great base recipe, I really enjoyed trying this soup.  I used left-over rotisserie chicken and did add a heaping tablespoon or so of oyster sauce, as I felt this needed some "meatiness"in the flavor, some umami to it. I added asian rice noodles as well.  Tasty!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

I chose this recipe because, like the name says, it's made with ingredients you already have. This was the coconut/curry flavor I was looking for! I made as stated except I cubed some chicken breast and sauteed it in the pot beforehand. I also combined all the seasonings and mixed about a teaspoon in with the onions while they cooked to enhance the flavor (and added the remainder of the spices in as per the recipe). Gave this four stars as both the hubby and I thought the soup could have used a little more "oomph" (the coconut milk may have toned the flavors down a little). But definitely worth making again!

I made this recipe following all instructions carefully, and I don't understand how anyone can tolerate that much red pepper....yeeesh!  After the fire subsided a bit, the second flavor that hit us was the overwhelming lemon.  I'm giving this recipe three stars because I appreciate the effort and experimentation that went into it.  I certainly couldn't have come up with this from scratch.  I think it has a lot of promise, so I'm going to try it again with a few substitutions.  I'll use just a dash or two of lime or lemon juice, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and maybe just a bit of oyster sauce.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I love coconut soup but this was AWFUL!!! I should've known better than dumping that much curry powder into the pot.  It was SO strong.  I had to rinse everything off in a strainer and then just put it on rice.

Just what I was looking for! I followed the recipe exactly until I diced up 2 potatoes that I had microwaved for 3 minutes and added with the carrots (just to make it a bit more filling) and using half lemon half lime juice. We moved to a place without any Thai restaurants and I had a craving...this satisfied my Thai starved taste buds completely (and without having to track down lemongrass)! Thank you for sharing :)
