Uh! This is so good! I have had my eyes on this for a while because it sounded interesting and today I finally made it. Absolutely delicious. I browned the bacon in a sauce pan then sauted the onion, garlic and celery in the bacon juice. After this, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved the way the apples smelled as they simmered in the red wine. This is definitely a nice complex soup and the flavours blend so well. It does come out thick and 'stewy' but I think that's how this soup should be. Thank you. I'll be making again and again.

I made this recipe out of the All Recipes cookbook, "Dinner Tonight".  If you don't have one of the All Recipes cookbook you're really missing some wonderful recipes.  This one is my favorite.

On to the soup: I was skeptical at first, but as I prepared the recipe the aroma filled our home. My husband came inside and asked, "What's that divine aroma?"  It really is a deliciously different take on classic ingredients.

I did a few things differently, but not by much. Rather than discard the bacon grease I used it to saute' the onion and garlic.  I puree'd the stewed tomatoes to give the soup a smooth consistency. I used dry sherry rather than red wine and I added 1 cup of half and half at the end to make it a creamy tomato soup.  As you can tell, this is not something you'll make every day.  It is very, very rich.  But, for special occasions it is wonderful.  My husband loved it and so did our guests.  I served it with smoky cheddar grilled cheese sandwiches.  Wow!  The variety of flavors will blow you away.

Good N Easy.  Next time I will sauté the Celery with the onion and garlic so it's not quite so crunchy.  Of course, bacon flavors so many things wonderfully.  But, I think this would even be good without the bacon, for a lot less fat.  
Love the apples cooked in wine.  That gives me lots of ideas!

I am a cook at a local Casino resturant, I am responsible for making fresh soup daily. This soup sold out within an hour of dinner service! not to mention we had soup thieves: general manager, and floor mamnager, supervisor and other staff actually eating the soup before the public really had a chance to eat it. But for the few customer who had a chance they loved it. The waitress' said that some of the customers were hestinatant because of the apple in the soup but were surpisingly happy when the eat it. 
I myself loved it! and make it every year for thanksgivving and christmas, to shake thehunger pain when waiting for the turkey to be cooked. My family loves it too.

I use half granny smith apples and half pink lady apples comes out perfect every time!

This is a great, hearty soup! Very layered and complex flavors, yet pretty simple to make. The morning of meal, I prepared the recipe up to the point of adding the apple/wine/bacon mixture into the soup. Then, I combined everything in my slow cooker. About an hour before serving, I plugged in the slow cooker and set it on low. Very good, and very Italian-tasting!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I would definitely double the recipe, however, as it served 6 women a cup-sized portion and we all WANTED MORE!!!  It is better the second day.

This soup blends the best flavors for a wintry day. I used sherry in lieu of red wine and it worked fine. However, I also recommend not draining the can of pinto beans because the added juice stretches the dish. Loved it madly!

This was definitely an odd combination. Actually, I found this recipe by searching on the random ingredients I had left over from preparing a meal last week. It was actually very good -- though I left out the celery and substituted kidney beans for pinto. Unfortunately I boiled the apple in cooking wine, and along with the bacon and beef stock, this made for a slightly-too-salty soup. But I'd do it again (with unsalted wine!) for sure.

I love this soup, I've made it several times, once for a party. It's interesting and unique, but simple enough to appease picky tastes. I make 3 small changes: 1. Saute the onions and garlic in a few tbsps of the reserved bacon grease 2. Replace 1 cup of the beef stock with APPLE CIDER! 3. Throw everything into a crock pot for 6 hours on low after the browning the onion/garlic. Just makes the process a bit easier.

Hearty and delicious! This one's going into the regular winter rotation! I made this tonight with minor changes - a can of white beans instead of pintos (I think any 'soup' bean would be fine here) also sauteed celery along with onions in the same pan as the bacon, and used an entire quart of beef broth - 2 cups of broth was a bit too thick of consistency for me. I noticed some comments about this being too sweet, I'm guessing a sweet red wine was used. If you're not familiar with wine and aren't sure what to use, I'd suggest going with a drier red like a cabernet, merlot or pinot noir. Finally, because of the bacon, this recipe didn't need extra salt. A little pepper, some mozzarella and bread made this a 5 star winner for my wife and I. Oh yeah, I'm going to double this next time!

I chopped the bacon while partially frozen before cooking and used a granny smith apple, which I peeled first before chopping. And I substituted ginger ale for the red wine.  Don't forget to take out the bay leaf before serving (the directions didn't mention this). What I'd do differently next time is put the stewed tomatoes into the food processor for a couple pulses before putting into the pan simply b/c I don't like large pieces of tomatoes. It's chilly outside and has been raining all day today. I just finished eating a bowl of this for lunch and it was absolutely delicious!

This was an excellent recipe.  I took it to work, and everyone wanted samples because it smelled so good.  I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches and salad at home and my family loved it.   I'm diabetic and constantly looking for flavorful recipes; this one fit right into my meal plan with only a few tweaks.  I used three slices of center cut bacon to reduce sodium and increase flavor; used low sodium beef consumme instead of stock for more flavor; used white navy beans rinsed and drained to reduce sodium; used 2 bay leaves instead of 1; and added a couple of tablespoons of frozen apple juice.  I also like a thicker soup, so I added 1 tablespoon of corn starch dissolved with a little of the soup about 15 min before serving. The next day I threw some leftover rice and shrimp in to make a complete meal and served it with cornbread.  Next time I'll make it thicker with a roux, but this recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was ok, but not one of our favorites.  I'm sure it's just a matter of taste, but to us it reminded us of a slightly sweet minestrone.  We all ate our servings, but no one went back for seconds and no one wanted to save the leftovers.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  I've been wanting to make this for quite some time and I'm glad I finally did.  Try it for yourself.

Just made this soup for my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  I had to make 24 servings, so it took quite awhile.  I gotta say that this is one of the most interesting soups I've ever made or even eaten.  The flavors are rich and the aroma makes your house smell terrific.  The only change I made was using basil instead of bay leaves.  I was unsure as to what kind of wine and apples to use, so I chose Merlot and Red Delicious Apples.  I think that was a good way to good.  The sweetness of the wine matched the sweetness of the apples perfectly.  I highly recommend making this soup.  It was pretty easy to do, even for an amateur cook!  Two thumbs up!!

Delicious and hearty. I substituted 1/2 cup apple juice for some of the wine. I poured the finished soup into bowls and then topped it with some peeled, diced apples and a little shredded parmesan. My guests were soooo impressed (and they were a tough crowd). I served it with some hearty peasant bread.

Thanks Jennifer!  As one reviewer said, it has a complex taste which is great - something different. If you followed the directions to a T it has to be great - I sometimes change things and add a little more of what my family likes.  We all love bacon so I used a few more slices, then I did saute all vegetables in some of the bacon fat rather than oil.  I also used kidney beans since I didn't have pinto beans.  It's a keeper and it can definitely be made a day ahead since it is more flavorful the next day.

Mercy this soup is excellent!  I followed some other suggestions and used bacon grease i/o olive oil to saute the onion, garlic AND celery.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful!

This is absolutely fantastic! I wish I got to eat it! I'm making this as part of a meal for a family at church who is going through some tough times. I'll be serving it with Winter Fruit Salad from this site and some cranberry rice muffins from the package of Bob's Red Mill white rice flour. I needed a meal that was both gluten and dairy free and found this recipe. I had a ton of apples from the orchard so I figured this, with the salad, would be perfect. The serving size is not correct, unless you are serving 8 tiny people with small appetites. I thought I would have to double it for 9 people and bought the stuff to do that, but then once everything was in the pot I realized that it wasn't going to cut it and had to quadruple it at the last second. I had used up all my beef bouillon cubes and had to add chicken cubes and more water . I threw in one extra can of kidney beans on top of the pinto beans I already had in there. I used 1 c. marsala and 1 c. sherry for the wine. sauteed the apples in the marsala and stirred the sherry into the soup. Like other people, I cooked the onion and garlic in the bacon grease and skipped the oil. I think increasing the servings to 32 would feed 8 to 10 people with average to large appetites. It is a very hearty soup and I'm going to have to make it for myself sometime. I only got to taste a spoonful to make sure it was worthy of serving to other people :) Next time I would just chop the apples instead of slicing them, though.

Ok.. so this is definitely the best soup I've ever had in my life.. I did make several changes though but the outcome was so phenomenal that I simply have to share.  I followed the recipe exactly.  At the end, to spruce it up a bit, I added 1 and 1/2 T chili powder, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, 1 t of cinnamon, 2 T of brown sugar and grated some nutmeg.  I also added one jalapeno pepper with seeds and the result was outstanding.  Very spicy but very good.  Try it both ways if you like spice, you will love it.  This is now my favorite soup.

This soup is easy and really good.  Lots of different flavors coming together.  I was very careful with the ingredients because of so many mentions of possible saltiness and it turned out fine, but I didn't add anymore at all.  After I'd eaten about half the bowl the salt factor was beginning bother me (almost the same feeling when you've eaten too many potato chips!).  Next time I'll use 'no salt added tomatoes' and I'll just add the italian seasonings to them, and maybe reduced-sodium bacon.

This was very good for our cold winter night last night.  My husband gave it a pretty good, but said he would eat it again.  He compared it to an italian soup from a restaurant, but said he liked this one better!  I didn't tell him there were apples in it until he had already told me he liked it.  I thought the combination sounded odd and almost didn't try it, but I'm glad I did.  We topped it with a shredded Italian cheese mix and had grilled cheese sandwiches with it.  I cut the recipe in half since there were just 2 of us and there were no left overs.  I think the "serves 8" of the recipe would be small servings.  I think this might be good to serve for a ladies get-together one cold afternoon.

This soup is truly amazing. It is a little labor intensive but you will definitely be rewarded with a soup that is awesome the first day but amazing the third day. It is fine the way it is but I added a little fennel and sautéed all the veg in the bacon grease and also added a little apple juice when simmering. This took it absolutely over the top. This is one you will want to double if not triple. None will go to waste, trust me. This also makes a great braising liquid for pork tenderloin as well. Made a fantastic Christmas dinner.

This was full of flavor.  I decided to go all the way with this and added toasted sourdough bread cubes on top and then a slice of swiss cheese, broiled it until the cheese melted, and served it like French Onion soup.  Delish!

I used low sodium broth and rinsed the beans (as suggested by other reviewers) and did not add any salt and the soup tasted great.

Made this yesterday morning on a cold snowy day in St. Louis MO.  Wonderful soup.  Took the advice and sauteed the celery along with the onions and garlic.  Didn't use the cheese, as didn't have any on hand.    Loved all the flavors and will make again.  Thanks Jen.

This recipe is amazingly awesome and easy, full of flavors.  Unfortunately the directions aren't real clear so I will share what I did and it turned out great!  In step 2 after everything else is added simmer for 20 min.  Simmer the apples and wine until the wine is reduced.  The apples will taste wonderful and you won't taste the alcohol.  Add these to the soup and simmer another 15 minutes and you will have a wonderful dish. oh one last thing, really slice the apples paper thin and in bit size pieces along with the tomatoes, cut those also in bite size pieces.

This was very good.  Interesting flavors. Two days later it was even better.  I made as directed, but next time I will add an extra apple and maybe try pureeing the tomatoes. I will also make a day ahead of serving. Still a winner just the way it is. Thanks!

Whenever I make this soup, everyone asks for seconds!  Delicious and hearty.  Good for fall and winter evenings.  Pair with cornbread muffins or Italian bread.

Absolutely perfect!  This soup is so hearty and tasty and beautiful in the bowl, the best remedy for chilly nights.  I used Smoking Loon Merlot for the wine and thought it worked really well.  Also, i used kidney beans instead of pinto.  My only regret was that there wasn't more yummy soup.  This recipe will feed 2, maybe 3, people.  will definitely double it next time for lots of leftovers!  fyi, it does take a little while to put all of the ingredients together, but my friend and i passed the time drinking the red wine and munching on extra bacon.  it made such a fabulous evening that we decided to make 'soup night' a fall tradition.  THANKS SO MUCH for this recipe!

I made this soup last night and it is a definite winner...nice and chunky with excellent flavour.  I especially like the apple cooked in wine.  It adds little sweet surprises to the soup.  I would say it makes about 5 - 6 servings, not 8 as stated.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow....this was sooooo yummy.  I had my doubts at first, because the flavor combinations sounded strange to me, but it turned out absolutely delicious.  The best thing about this soup were the apples.  Next time I will increase it to two apples.  I also added 1/2 cup of water to this soup since it turned out a little bit like stew.  It tasted so great there were no leftovers.

Loved this recipe.  I made exactly as written.  I used a merlot for the wine.  My husband watched me cooking the apples and when he saw me put them in the soup he had a disappointed look. But after tasting it, he said the soup would have just been plain old soup if not for the apples.  He liked it.  I also used more bacon, more like 10 slices.  (and it wasn't too salty.)  I also topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and had cream on the table for those who wanted a creamy soup.

This recipe sounds yummy and the reviews are encouraging. I haven't made it and have two questions: 1) do I drain and rinse the beans and 2) what can I use as a substitute for the wine? Thank you.

Made the recipe exactly.  My husband and I didn't love this.  The flavour was good, but perhaps the texture threw us off.  Maybe we'd like it as a blended soup, may try again.  Rated it four because of flavour, but would have rated 3 because of texture.

Delicious and filling!  I didn't have the red wine, so I used sherry, but the flavor was still great.  We ate ours on a snowy day with smoked gouda grilled cheese sandwiches - fantastic and easy!

This was a good hearty soup, but not spectacular.  However, I do believe it is because I chose some of the wrong variables.  Next time would use a granny smith apple and dice so that the apple retains its flavor (I used Fuji).  I would also pick a higher quality bacon and definitely thick cut.  Overall a decent soup.  Cooking apples in with the wine though - that's a whole new culinary world in itself. Thanks!

This recipe intrigued me and after reading the reviews, I decided to "tweak" the recipe.  The result of my "tweaking", yielded a terrific soup. My changes to the recipe are as follows: Since the recipe seemed to be taking on an Italian flavor, I decided to brown Italian sausage slices and added them to the soup stock at the end of the simmer time. I sauteed the celery, onion and garlic in the pan drippings from the sausage. In addition, I used 3c. beef stock, added an additional 28 oz. can Italian style tomatoes and increased the wine by an additional 1/4 c.  Instead of slicing the apple, I chopped a Granny Smith apple and added it to soup mixture at the end of the simmer time so that the apple would have some crunch.  Since I was serving the soup later, the addition of the sausage & apple at the end of the cooking time, softened the apple just enough without being too soft.  For serving, I garnished the soup with Parmigano/Reggiano cheese and served it with crusty bread.  Since I used the Italian sausage, I omitted the bacon.  The next time I make this soup, I will also add the bacon together with the sausage and determine what depth of flavor I get with that.  All in all, this recipe is very easy with terrific flavor. I will definitely be making this again, and my husband seconds that!

This one just didn't work for me. The dish is fine, and as a bean soup, it's pretty good. But the apple/wine thing did nothing for me at all. These are the ingredients that attracted me in the first place. Made up the dish just as written looking forward to some magic. But, it simply wasn't there. Frankly, if I were to make this dish again, I'd forgo the wine/apple thing, and just build out an good, thick soup. I'd rate that dish at least a 4 star.

Hubby said give it a 5-star review! The unusual mix of ingredients caught my eye and as I read the entire recipe the imagined flavors intrigued me. I used 1 1/2 oz real bacon bits from a can (no greasy mess!) and minced garlic from a jar. Everything else was as listed. Hubby didn't know apple was one of the ingredients until I commented that they looked like potatoes. He paused, looked at his soup, and exclaimed, "These are apples?" :-) I'll be making this again, especially on winter Sundays when we're both home watching football and can enjoy the fragrant steam as it simmers.

This was a great soup. I tripled the recipe and it filled my giant crock pot (I didn't cook it in this, just served it at work in it). I used half golden delicious apples and half granny smith. I did drain the pinto beans and I used about 2 tbls of the bacon drippings to emphasize the bacon flavor. I made it the night before and added the crumbled bacon just before serving. It turned out very well. I think the apples would have been less soft if I had served it the same night I made it. Make sure not to over cook them in the wine. Thanks for the recipe!

I was curious about how the sweetness of the apples would harmonize with the other wholesome veggies and bacon. To my suprise and to my picky boyfriend's delight we both absolutely loved the soup with french bread. I added a little more water and the bean liquid b/c it seemed to stewy to me.

When I saw this, I was skeptical but decided to try it after reading the reviews.  This soup was fantastic!  My family grumbled when I told them but everybody went back for seconds.  I took other reviewers suggestions and sauted the onion, garlic and celery in the bacon grease.  I also doubled the bacon and used a granny smith apple.  This will definitely be a regular meal in our household.

MmmmMmmmm, Good! Kind of a mellow soup. Very nice blend of flavors. I did a teetotaler's version, but crushed some grapes in with the apples and 1/4 cup water to make up for absence of wine. Still, though, an excellent soup, I'm sure either way.

Guess it's a little too fancy for this family -- nothing about the taste worked for us. Definitely much less than the sum of its parts.

This was good but if I were to make it again, I would probably use kidney beans instead of pintos. I was a bit hesitant about how prominent the apple would be, so I used a small Gala - it was just right. This was nice for a change but I don't think I'd make it again. Thanks.

Excellent for a cold winter's night!  If you don't like crunchy celery in soup, I would suggest cooking it with the onion.  Any beans will do; I used kidney instead of pinto.

This was good. It tasted better once the soup sat a bit and seasonings mixed in more. I made this for a lunch and my friend and I liked it. We made grilled cheese sandwich to accompany the soup.

This soup is good, but not outstanding.  Even though I added no salt to the recipe because of the stock and the bacon, it was still pretty salty.  I probably won't make it again, as my husband really didn't care for it.

This was a huge hit! I read the reviews and decided to sauté the celery, onion and garlic in the bacon grease, halve the beef stock with apple cider, and swap the pinto beans for kidney beans. It is simple to make and has very rich and complex flavors. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it absolutely wasn't. This is going on the Fall/Winter Comfort Food menu!

This soup is fantastic - we love it, but the servings are definitely off (especially if you are eating this as a main course). I set the servings for 8 and it really only made 3 servings (my husband and I ate it for dinner with grilled cheese and had one meal-sized portion left).

This soup was a lot easier to make than I first thought.  I did not have bacon so I used panchetta instead.  With a splash of some good hot sause it was great.  Served with bisquits to sop up the soup.  Will try again with bacon to see how much the flavor changes.

I needed more broth than the recipe called for and I honestly didn't think the apple added much positive to the soup.  It was better the next day in my opinion.

My husband was skeptical, but after trying it, he rated it pretty good.  The wine gave the apples a sickly color.  Probably won't make it all the time, but it was a fun recipe to try.

LOVED this soup!  Like others, I sauteed the onions, garlic and celery in the bacon grease, and pureed the canned tomatoes for a smoother consistency.  Other than that, the recipes is perfect.  Even better left over!

This is pretty yummy.  I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to balance the acidity of the canned tomatoes.  It's one of those dishes that, once you start, will leave you returning for "just one more spoonful."  I will be adding this to my regular household menu.

This was a big and surprising)hit! Followed recipe as stated with one exception.  I did not simmer the apples and wine separately. Put everything in one pot and simmered in for about 2 hours.  The only change I will make next time is to puree the tomatoes before added them to the soup -- I think it will make a nicer consistency.  Will definitely make again.

As I was making this I was starting to wonder if it was some kind of joke...it just sounded too weird but the reviews were so good I had to try it.  It was SO good...thought I was in a gourmet restaurant!!  Didn't know if I was supposed to drain the beans so I didn't! Didn't seem to affect the flavor.

It was pretty good.. the second and third days.  Right off the stove, it was a little iffy- my husband was not a huge fan but I thought it was good enough to at least eat the leftovers!  I actually preferred them cold.  It is always a little strange/disappointing when good crispy bacon is made soggy, but it did make for an interesting recipe that I have been wanting to try for a while.

I love this soup. Such an interesting blend of flavors. I've made it two ways so far, with and without the pinto beans. I prefer the beans, but I recommend cutting the quantity in half. The flavor and consistency of the beans tend to overpower the soup. This is a soup that you should make a few days in advance because while it's tasty right out of the pot, it's AMAZING a few days later!!

The taste was unique, and the leftovers were even better.  But the consistency seemed lacking. Perhaps it's because I made this in the fall, and was expecting something a bit more hearty.  I'm keeping it to amend for later uses...  Thanks for sharing!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was not terrible, but it was not as good as the other reviews made it out to be.  I had to add a lot of salt.  I put Parmesan Cheese on each serving which helped add some saltiness as well.

I made this for a work party and it got rave reviews!  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions to use low sodium broth and bacon, and it turned out perfectly.  Also, I quadrupled the recipe and it still worked magnificently.

This was pretty good. I was worried about the amount of salt, so I used no salt added tomatoes and then just added a teaspoon of italian seasoning. I also used reduced sodium beans and I didn't add any additional salt at the end. I did find that I needed to use the whole container of beef stock though, so I'm guessing I ended up doubling the amount of liquid, to get the consistency that I was looking for.

Not any one flavor was predominant; they all blended well.  I used a jar of canned tomatoes from last summer, so I added 1 tsp. of dried Italian seasonings.  Also used kidney beans since I didn't have pinto.

I have been wanting to make this for a very long time. Much to my disappointment, it was bland and more bean flavored than anything else. I could not taste the bacon or apples. I usually give a recipe two tries just to be fair but this one won't make the second cut.

Finally! A unique soup for me to try on a crisp fall day…I get so bored with the usual soup recipes. This isn’t anything crazy by any means. Its just a nice little combo of ingredients and flavors that work very nicely together. I also love that the bacon in the recipe is drained and you actually don’t use the drippings (while that would be delicious, Im sure) but instead use olive oil to sauté the onions and garlic. It makes for a bit healthier soup and with all the great flavors you don’t miss out on anything anyway. I actually used canned dice tomatoes instead of stewed to cut down on the sugar. Instead a added a light drizzle of maple syrup to the pot to add a touch of natural sweetness. With the apples and the apple smoked bacon I used it was a fantastic pairing. Excellent soup! Give it a try:))

I was intrigued by the combination of the ingredients. I used the bacon grease to sauté the onions and garlic, otherwise I followed the recipe. The aroma is incredible. The blend of flavors delicious. I will definitely make this again. It's an impressive soup to serve guests.

I did change the recipe a bit so I guess i'm not rating the exact recipe but this was amazing. I double this recipe plus I added 2 extra cups of beef broth (6 all together), didn't have minced garlic so used 6 fresh cloves instead, didn't double the wine or apple (next time I will double it just didn't have enough wine to double!), and I also added maybe 2 slices of bacon only to the soup and used the rest for garnish as I find then you can add the amount you want (and the bacon stays crispy). I also didn't have any pinto beans so I added a can of red kidney beans and a can of chick peas...turned out very yummy! Also used the suggestions to use the bacon grease to fry the onion, celery, and garlic. I recommend this lots and lots!

I made this exactly and it was so good.  I was surprised because of the odd combination of ingredients.  I did sprinkle a little sugar over it while it was cooking as I always add a little sugar with anything with tomatoes because I feel it brings out more of the flavor. My family loved it. However, I made this for 4 adults (2 were men) and we only got about 2.5  inches of soup in each of our bowls- it was a good thing we had a loaf of French bread to eat with it or we would have been hungry. Next time I will at least double it, probably triple it for 4 adults.

DELICIOUS!  I don't eat beef at all so I substituted chicken broth for the beef stock and it was absolutely outstanding.  I served it with corn muffins on a cold, rainy night.

Very comforting soup! I as well sauteed the garlic, celery and onion all together. Great for dipping a asiago bread in and eating with a salad. I will be making this again soon.

Very good flavor, quick, easy and versatile. I simplified by sauteing the celery with the onion and garlic and used precooked bacon crumbles. Doubled the recipe but not the olive oil to reduce fat. I had no pinto beans on hand so subbed a can each of garbanzo and kidney beans. Great winter meal that doesn't have to simmer all day to have full hearty flavor!

I was feeling lazy so I tried this with Trader Joes low sodium tomato soup (qt) and Merlot. Added a little extra bacon and no broth. It had a rich creamy consistency and oh so yummy.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only change I made was I used a maple syrup flavored bacon instead of regular.  Everyone I served it to raved about it and wanted to know where I got the recipe.  This is a foolproof recipe that will be a hit with whoever you serve it to.

This is an unusual blend of flavors that combine to make a delicious soup.  I made it as directed except that I sauteed the celery with the onion and I added a little more beef stock.  A nice way to use fall apples.

This is delicious! Especially the second day. I thought my family would really balk at the title when I told them what I was making, but all of them (except for my youngest brother because he is quite picky) said it sounded interesting. Plus, they really liked it (oh, except for aforementioned brother). I will definitely make this again!

Here's some details about my prep of this soup. A few directions were iffy, so I'm including them in my review. I drained & rinsed the beans. I also did not add any salt or pepper. I chopped the bacon into slices before cooking it (so much easier this way). And I omitted the celery because my husband doesn't like it. I also added another 1/2 can of diced tomatoes because it looked like it needed more tomatoes... and it definitely did because the soup only made 4 servings. I used cabernet sauvignon which paired nicely with the tomatoes. This is really scrumptious with many layered flavors but it honestly tasted like a fancier version of a bean & ham soup. It's very simple to make, too, and smells wonderful while cooking. I made hot ham & cheese sandwiches to serve with it and everyone enjoyed it.

This was a tasty soup.  Don't let the apple put you off.  It is not prominent, but seems to add something to the background that really works.  I did use an entire onion, about 1 cup.

One poster suggested adding 2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes---yikes that made it so spicy we could hardly eat it.  I will definately make it again but still stick to the original recipe with only regular canned tomatoes.

This is a good soup but to me it just tasted like another good tomato soup really,but like another reviewer,I may try another brand of apple. Update,I made this soup again,it's much better this time! But I won't put red wine vinegar in there ever again,I put in 7 cuts of bacon and a WHOLE box of beef broth and it was delish!

This is really good & really easy to make. I took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the celery with the onion and garlic, just to make it softer. I also added a little bit of tomato paste just to give it an extra tomato-ey kick. It's a great winter warmer!

Wow!  This is SO good!  Whole family loved it.  Directions did not say whether to drain the beans or not.  I did not.  Pureed the tomatoes as my 16 year old son does not like cooked tomatoes.  He had no clue they were in there.  :) Might throw a little fresh parmesan on top of the filled bowls next time.  I will be making this again and again!

Liked it very much. Next time I will cut the thin apple slices down to bite size. I made this  and froze it. It was wonderful. Because I was going to freeze it I soaked the apples in warm wine, but did not cook them. I put the appples in just before I froze the soup. The apples turned out perfect after reheating, the were not mushy at all.

My picky husband loved this - I sauteed the onion and celery together as recommended, and then I blended them so it didn't have chunks. Also threw in some star shaped noodles for texture. Had a very complex and sophisticated flavor - easy to make but tastes like a gourmet dish!

This is now my favorite soup!  I even broke the rule and used cooking marsala wine because the grocery store I go to doesn't sell the real stuff... and it still turned out great.

I used turkey bacon and diced tomatoes (instead of stewed). Wow! This was a delicious and filling soup. Will definitely make again. Unique flavor combo, but works well.

This was a very unique meal.  The flavors were all over the place.  We ate it with corn tortilla's and sliced cabbaged rolled in it.  I will make this often and will add potato to the red wine and skip the apple.  I loved the apple but my husband did not and said he would love it with potato.

I so much wanted to like this recipe!  My favorite dinner is sauteed apples and onions with Canadian bacon, so I was sure that this soup would have similar appeal.  Nope.  It had a nice consistency, and it was filling; however, I just couldn't adjust to the flavor of the apples combined with the tomatoes and beef broth.  My boyfriend thought it was okay but missing some sort of spice.  So, overall it was okay, but not great.  I'm giving it 3 stars because at least it looked good, and I can see how the flavors would appeal to some.

This was a fantastic easy lunch!  The only thing I did differently is that I used a whole onion diced and I used black beans instead of pinto.  I also left out the celery and it was terrific!!  Will definitly make again and I passed it along to my mom.

I was skeptical but pleasantly suprised.  The flavors do go together and each spoonful seems better than the last.  I pretty much followed the recipe and will make it again.

Very interesting though I found it a bit sour, probably from the canned tomatoes I used. I'll try it again with a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes. The flavours blended better the second day, and I added some honey-garlic barbecue sauce which sounds bizarre, but was really tasty.

This is a great soup. I didn't have pinto beans and used pork and beans instead. It seem to work because my family raved about it.

My family really enjoyed this soup.  It's a unique flavor and a great twist to tomato soup.  I usually add my own flare but I made this soup exactly as directed.

I added fresh tomatoes from my garden, 2 cans of pinto beans instead of 1, 6 strips of bacon instead of 5, 1 medium white onion and 3 teaspoons of garlic, and 1 large okra from my husband's garden.   I'm considering adding 1 seeded jalapeño pepper because I like a little kick in my soups.

I ditched the onion & pinto beans due to allergies and not having the beans on hand, and subbed some (about 2 tbsp) balsamic vinegar for the wine because we have no wine. It was nice!

Delicious!  I mostly followed the recipe but confess to adding a little more bacon and a second can of beans to bulk the soup up a little.

Everyone loved this soup.  I made one change, substituting cannellini beans for the pinto beans.  Also made a fortunate mistake by using one cup of wine instead of half.  Thank you!

We had this last night with toasted cheese sandwiches and it was a good combination. The only thing I did different was saute the celery and some fine chopped carrot with the onion and garlic in the bacon fat.  I used Italian Diced Tomatoes because that is what I had.  I agree with Swampy63  the recipe definitely does NOT feed 8, even 6 is a stretch.  I enjoyed the unusual combination of flavors but I cannot say that we loved it.  Felt there was too many beans and maybe it didn't really need the bacon.  I wanted to really love it and that didn't happen.  Sorry...  might try shuffling the flavors around somehow at a later date trying to "make it work".

This was easy to make.  I followed other's suggestions.  Use the bacon grease instead of the olive oil, Saute the onion, garlic, and celery together.  Pureed the stewed tomatoes. Used dry sherry and added some half and half at the end.

This is soooo good! I wouldn't make this every time I'm craving tomato soup, but it's a lovely variation for something a little sweeter. I had no apples but had a pear; I also added a dash of thyme to the soup. Still amazing. I'd make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good soup, but after reading all of the glowing reviews, I expected more.  I made it one day and ate it the next day...knowing that soup gets better with "age".  However, it just tasted like homemade soup...nothing to die for.  I don't taste the apple or the wine for that matter.  I will probably look for other recipes rather than make this one again.

Made as written it is a very flavorful hearty stew.  The flavor of apple does indeed come out much more the following day, while the first day the tomatoes take over which is still very tasty.  It does not make a lot of soup.  There's very little liquid to support it serving 8.  My big stock pot was barely 1/4 full and we were able to get two and a half bowls total which is not nearly enough.  If you like lots of soup so you can eat some now and freeze some for later, consider quadrupling this one.

SOOOOO good. Thanks for putting this recipe in your email yesterday; I probably wouldn't have found it by searching that particular set of ingredients!

Like other reviewers, I used the bacon fat to saute the onions, garlic and celery, and used the soup pot to cook the bacon, as well. Why dirty three pots instead of two?

I doubled the recipe, as I'm going out of the country, and wanted some to freeze for my husband, as well as leftovers for me! I also used cannelini (Italian white beans) instead of pintos, because I'm not fond of the everlasting crunchiness of pintos. My local Super Target didn't have stewed tomatoes of any kind, so I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and threw in a sweet pepper from my garden. 

It was plenty salty from the canned produce and the bacon, so didn't need any added salt. 

The apples were so beautiful simmering in the red wine that I almost hated to put them in, but oh! they added another layer of tasty goodness to this simple and warming soup.

My husband and I both liked this. I did a few minor changes for convenience and to use what I had in the house.  I used white cooking wine instead of red and regular stewed tomatoes which I pulsed in the blender, and I added about 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp oregano.  I increased the bacon to 7 slices so I could crumble some on top of each serving.  I chopped the apple instead of slicing it. I put the broth spices and tomatoes and beans in the slow cooker on high while I cooked the bacon then sauteed the onion and celery in 1 TBL of the bacon fat.  I added the veggies to the slow cooker and simmered the apples in the cooking wine.  When softened I added them to the crock pot and crumbled 5 pieces of bacon into the soup ( saving the extra I made for garnish) and let it cook while I made garlic bread.  To serve I crumbled 1/4 slice of bacon on top of each soup bowl. Next time, and there will be a next time, I am going to add the apple to the sauteed onions and celery after 10 minutes then add the wine and let them all simmer for about 8-10 minutes, before adding to the slow cooker. I turned the slow cooker down to low until ready to serve.  This is so good, expect people to have seconds, maybe thirds. I served this with garlic bread and a side salad with sherbet for dessert.

This sounded so good I made a double batch.  Served with pretzel bread on the side.  Delicious!  Looking forward to left-overs for supper tonight!  I may have accidentally posted a one star review earler.  If I did may I apologize for the mistake.  This easily rates 5 stars!

The soup is very easy to make.  I cooked my onions and garlic in the bacon grease to give more bacon flavor, I would recommend this.  I couldn't find pinto beans so I used a can if assorted beans, it worked out very good; giving the soup visual variety.  Recipe doesn't make a lot of soup, enough for a family meal, with a bowl left over if no one asks for seconds.  I will make this soup again and again.

The flavor of the bacon never really melded into the soup.  Also, I will dice up the apple next time rather than slice.  Very good flavor.

I love love love this soup!  It's nice to make to just have on hand as well as for a specific meal.  When I get hungry and want a healthy snack- soup does the trick and this one makes me feel like it's a gourmet snack.  I also serve it as a meal with fresh bread and a salad.  This is fabulous!!!!

This soup is bursting with flavor.  Only change I made was that I left a little bacon grease in the pot and cooked in that instead of olive oil.

This is the most awesome soup I have ever made.  Every spoonful was a wonderful surprise.  The only change I made was to saute the onion, garlic and celery in one tablespoon of grease that I saved from cooking the bacon.  I'm sorry but; two seniors ate the whole thing, along with some garlic bread.  I cannot believe the flavour, so you just keep eating more and more!  We loved it.  Next time I will have to double it if we are having guests.

This soup sounded so strange, but came across my daily email.  I went with my gut and fixed it because it sounded so simple and I had all the ingredients.  I followed the exact recipe and used a Fuji apple.  It was delicious.  I served it with a Caesar Salad and am a little sad there isn't much left over for tomorrow's lunch.

My husband doesn't eat beans, so omitted them, and this was still a great soup!  I sauteed the onion and garlic in sherry and used an immersion blender on the tomatoes before adding them. Smelled great too!

A really delicious and different soup recipe that everyone loved.  Minor changes included using the bacon grease to saute onions and garlic, substituting apple juice for some of the broth, adding more red wine than called for and using a mix or red and kidney beans (dried, soaked) that I had left from another recent meal.  Something about the flavor reminded me of German style potato salad.  This is definitely one I will make again.

This is a delicious soup. I followed the instructions exactly and YUM!  I read where a few folks found the soup bland.  I wonder if it was the wine the selected?  I chose a Shiraz and it works out beautifully.  I just tried a small bowl and OMG...I cannot wait until dinner.  Just another hour!

I REALLY liked this recipe.  It was very rich, full of flavor and quite easy to make!  I did substitute Garbanzo beans for Pinto beans (I like them better) and I chopped the bacon prior to frying it (it's easier for me to saute).  Next time I make it, I'll buy diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes (to save time chopping the large pieces).  A GREAT meal served with hearty bread.

First, I did some things differently.  I cooked the bacon in the same pan as everything else and used the bacon grease to cook the onion, garlic AND celery.  I knew the celery would be far to crunchy if I didn't cook it with the onion.  I'll say it's decent but lacking something.  Somehow the flavors just don't come together like you think they will.  It's a good enough base that I'll try again but I'll add some more spices and maybe a dollop of creme fraiche and Parmesan when served.

This is a delicious soup, almost the consistency of a stew, with a slighly smoky flavor. The only problem that I had with it is that the recipe doesn't make enough! I made it to have for lunch for the week and it was only enough for 1 night, with my family. Make sure you double the recipe!

Delicious! Based on reviews, here's what I did-- used 7 slices of bacon, then drained about half of the bacon fat and used the remaining to saute the celery, onion and garlic.  I used only 1 can of beef broth (which is 2 oz. shy of the recipe) since that's all I had on hand.  I used a honeycrisp apple that had been in my fridge a little too long and diced it about the size of the onions.  I used a cabernet for the red wine.  I did not drain the beans which made the soup thicker (I like it that way) and  cut up the big pieces of tomatoes with kitchen shears after they had been added them to the soup.  Added 2 bay bay leaves and didn't add any salt or pepper.  Will make it exactly the same next time!

This was fantastic!!  I had an excess of tomatoes and apples so I was looking for a way to use both.  Instead of draining the bacon grease I used it to cook the onions, garlic and celery.  So YUM!  And I used 2 fresh tomatoes in place of the stewed canned tomatoes.  Our dinner guests were skeptical but after one bite they were raving about it!  Huge hit!!!!!  Thank you!!  I'm actually making another pot this afternoon because they ate it all!  I would definitely double this recipe.

My husband loved it, I liked it.  The phrase, "the whole does not equal the sum of its parts", came to mind when I ate it. I'd give it three, but since my husband was such a fan I gave it four stars.

Very good. Only downfall is it does not make a very large portion. Will definitely double the recipe next time.

My wife and daughter aren't big fans of spicy soups, so I've made it to myself (they got nice tuna one). Had no tomatoes of recommended type, so I took Arrabbiata tomato sauce and it came out absolutely fantastic. Many thanks for recipe, goes straight to my favourites!

Great but I left out the beans and added sauteed mushrooms and little cubes of frozen beef fajita meat.

Excellent! I prefer more bacon and diced instead of stewed tomatoes, but still excellent with just about any bean too. I like to cube ( 1/4 ") parmesan cheese into the serving dish to cool it to a confortable temperature and melt the cheese, and I believe I'll try fresh spinach next time. Stiil an very tasty recipe as is, it holds up really well with many variations.

Hubby & I absolutely loved this soup...will make for company...a keeper. Of interest, son, recommended that I cut down on the wine a bit & omit the celery altogether...maybe use celery seed. He said celery ruined the texture. Thanks again for a great recipe.At 65...I need new ideas...for sure !

I made this recently and it came out okay, but seemed to be missing something.  Putting cheese on top helped somewhat, so I thought maybe it would work with a little cream in the actual soup?  I will try that next time...also I may put the tomatoes in a blender to chop them more finely next time.

I followed previous reviewers suggesting of making it a day before serving it.  After tasting it the next day I felt it was just okay.  I decided to puree it to see how it tasted, it was better.  The flavors were better combined.  I still thought it was a bit on the acidic side so I added approximately 1/4 cup of cream.  This helped to tone done the acidic taste.  My dinner guests were split on who liked or disliked it.  Out of 6 only two really liked it.  The consistency was that of pumpkin soup.  The wine taste seemed kind of strong.  Overall, I would give the recipe 3 stars but after adding the cream and pureeing it I would give it 4 stars.

After reading most of the reviews, I had much higher expectations.  It was okay, but I won't make it again.

Served this soup at a luncheon.  Everyone loved it!  Very easy to make, smelled and tasted awesome.  I used gala apples with the skin on and red cooking wine. The only think I would do different it to saute the celery with the onions for a minute to soften them and I would cut up the stewed tomatoes.  Otherwise, this soup is phenomenal.

I wouldn't say this was horrible.  Just tasteless.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  And it was totally bland.  I won't be making again.

This soup is Awesome! I just made it now for dinner. I pureed the tomatoes and added 1 cup half/half also and cornstarch to thicken it some more. Next time I won't puree it and leave out the half/half.  This would taste great with browned ground beef too for a hearty meal. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I wasn't going to try this recipe because the ingredients sounded a little too odd to me.  But, my husband got sick and needed to eat something healthy so I tried it anyway.  I had all the ingredients except the beef stock so I used chicken stock instead.  It was delicious.  My husband ate 2 huge bowls.  Thank you!

Fairly good, but the mixture of apples with Italian spices was very odd.

This was delicious.  It was truly amazing!  We did alter it some.  We used fresh pinto beans, fresh tomatoes, doubled the bacon, and used white wine instead of red (we were unexpectedly out).  I also omitted the celery because I didn't feel like going to the store.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes but really it wasn't.  

I loved this soup and will make it over and over again.

I just made it and it's a very interesting blend of flavors.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with mild chilies and 1 package of diced apple chicken sausages.  I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow.

The flavor was a pleasant surprise.  Have made it twice, once for my daughter, who has since made it herself.  Looking forward to making and eating it again!

This reminded me much of a vegetable soup, but it was still delicious! The apple is a very interesting add in. A great lunch or winter evening meal! I didnt have any red wine on hand, so I added white cooking wine and it still turned out great! Thanks!

This soup was ok.  To me, it tasted like bean soup with a tomato base.  I'm not a big fan of bean soup.  I will try it again & use black beans like someone else did.

This soup has a very unique flavor. I made it exactly as written except I used turkey bacon instead of regular to lower the fat content and I used kidney beans instead of pinto. This recipe wasn't my favorite and my husband wasn't crazy about it, but I enjoyed it overall.

I loved the recipe.  My mom couldn't beleive the name, but the kiddos liked it.  I was able to do one pan and then cooked it in a pot.  I boiled the stock as I sauteed the onions and garlic then just kept adding the ingredients in order to the pot to simmer.  We served it with sliced French bread adn I am eager for lunch tomorrow!

I think this is a good recipe.  Smelled good while the apples were simmering as others had said.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't think it was all that dynamite.  It was definately good, but it tasted like a good veggie soup (with bacon!).
It is nice for fall.
