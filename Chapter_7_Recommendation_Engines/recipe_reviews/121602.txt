I admit I chose to make this recipe purely out of sheer curiosity and a good dose of skepticism.  How good could these be with no sugar (the granulated kind), butter, flour or eggs? But then Magic Cookie Bars came to mind so I "hauled" out ALL four ingredients.  It took a lot longer for the oven to preheat than it did to whip these up.  I made things easy for myself both for cutting the bars and for clean-up and lined my pan with foil.  As I was making these S'Mores kept coming to mind so I just had to add a handful of mini marshmallows when these were done and just popped the pan under the broiler for a minute.  I'm a believer.  Can't beat 'em for gooiness and chocolatey goodness and they really do kind of taste like a squishy S'more!  I'm telling you, if you're short on baking ingredients, if your kid needs something for a school treat in a hurry, or if you just have a sweet tooth that needs satisfying NOW, keep these in mind!

My grandma has made these every Christmas for as long as I can remember.  The only difference is that she adds some vanilla and salt...she calls them Marians, but I suspect that she calls them that b/c that's the name of the lady who gave her the recipe a long time ago.  I love these so much and it always reminds me of Christmases spent in PA.

Well, don't try to use fat-free sweetened condensed milk, low fat graham crackers.  Tastes a bit cardboardy to me.  I did use milk chocolate chips and added a dash of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Again, don't try to go low fat, it just doesn't do the recipe justice.  ** Update on 4/4 -- these tasted much better the next day.  They were still slightly warm when I tried them on the night I made them.  Sorry for the bad first review, but I'd make this again, just know I have to make them at least 1 day in advance.

My FAVORITE recipe!  I love these bars, so sweet and goopy!  I added marshmallows once and called it S'Mores Bars.  I also made double chocolate by using chocolate graham crackers instead of regular. I had this recipe years ago and lost it.  Thanks so much for submitting this!!!

Skipped the nuts, added mini marshmallows on top before baking and took them camping.  Everyone was sad when they were gone.  Great for kids to make---easy!

Very good bars!  I accidently let them go too long in the oven so they got a little crunchy.  I would suggest, even if they look a little undone, to let them cook the rest of the way in the pan.  These were extremely easy to make, though!

i tried this recipe just because of the minimal ingredients. They turned out well, however I felt that they were far too sweet (due to the condensed milk possibly) and I think next time I will add more cracker crumbs to try to avoid the sweetness

Quick, so easy, gooey, and good! I left out the nuts, and added a few white chocolate chips on top. (Next time I won't, the semisweet chocolate chips are enough!) Baked for around 22 minutes, and they seemed to be just right :)

These were good. Kinda reminded me of the Magic bars. They are very easy for the kids to make. Be sure to spray your pan very well.

Simple recipe, very tasty.  I swapped chocolate graham crackers for regular, swapped peanut butter chips for choc chips.  I also doubled the recipe and made in a 9 X 13 pan lined with parchment.  Huge hit with my co-workers.

Simplicity at it's best!! I didn't do the salt/vanilla thing - made it almost exactly as stated with the exception of throwing some minature marshmellows on top. They were a hit at my (bring a treat) grandsons B.Day party. Thanks!! Will remember this for the next quick fix occasion.

They are sweet and they are gooey, but I was underwhelmed.  Don't think I will make these again, nothing special.

Made these today for a bake sale. They turned out good but I agree with several others they are a little too sweet. I added additional graham crackers but it didn't seem to help. I would suggest perhaps halving the sweetened condensed milk. I did not have any nuts but I think it turned out just fine without them.

I had no problem with them sticking.  They were gooey and good!  I threw on a handful of mini marshmallows and broiled for a few minutes - they were gone pretty fast!

Just the 'easy' factor makes these a 5 star.  Delicious, sweet, gooey.  Perfect for a quick treat!  Makes sure the pan is super greased....these like to stick to the pan.

This was totally awesome considering the few ingredients necessary and speediness of prep. I crushed the graham crackers as well as the walnuts in my food processor. The mixture was really tough to mix by hand, but I prevailed. :) I just wet my hands to press it down in the well-greased pan. Most of this was gone by last night, but I refrigerated the rest. My husband and daughter had the rest today. His piece was pretty darn hard (sweetened condensed milk plus refrigeration), and he said it's like concrete, but the best concrete I have ever eaten!!!  lol You may be wise not to store it in the fridge, though I didn't find it to be quite as hard as he did. :P

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  This is absolutely the most delicious decadent Bar Cookie recipe I've ever made - AND - no sugar.  The sweetness comes from the other ingredients.  I will be passing this recipe on to all my friends.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS.  I just mixed everything together at one time and patted it into the baking dish - so easy and so very very yummy.

My mother has had this recipe from 1959 as it was published with a little set of recipes from Eagle Brand milk.  It was known as "Gold Rush Brownies."  We always double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 pan.  Also, to get them out of the pan with more ease, grease the pan, then line just the bottom and not the sides with waxed(yes, not parchment this time!) and spray the top of the waxed paper with Pam. In cooler weather, they ship really well if you want to send some fabulous Christmas goodies.

So easy, and so yummy! I may actually cut back a bit on the chocolate chips next time, but other than that - delicious!
