Not bad and a nice change from our regular grilled potatoes. I cut the down the recipe and used two potatoes. I partially microwaved them first to cut down on the cooking time.  I used Kraft Light Italian dressing and didn't use a lot.  I added a bit of minced garlic and sprinkled them with a bit of kosher salt and cracked black pepper before wrapping them in foil and putting them on the grill.

This is also OUR favorite way to have potatoes.  Just perfect (and can also be baked, if you aren't grilling!).

Great recipe! We endd up slicing the potatoes to reduce grilling time and added some butter for flavor. Thanks, we will use this again for sure

Very easy & tasty - my favorite kind of recipe. I did add quite a bit of garlic. I threw it in a bowl and topped with sharp cheddar & a little sour cream. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Used homemade Italian dressing, baked at 400 degrees for 45-60minutes. Turned out great. I will be making these again and again!

These worked fine in the oven too.  Next time I'll add a little more spice, a tad bland but I loved how easy these were.

Slice pototoe 1/8" thick & onions a little thicker, slather w/Italian Dressing, salt and pepper.  Great with Grilled Salmon Skewers, maybe with bbq steak.

This was pretty good. I'd suggest adding my dressing on it to give it more flavor. I also nuked it in the microwave to start the cooking process quicker.

This is a wonderful recipe!  We used our favorite carmelized vidalia onion salad dressing rather than italian, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.   We baked them in the oven at 350 deg for 90 mins since it was raining.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe - this couldn't be any easier!

This was great! I added some kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to the packet and cooked them in the oven.  It was such a nice change from the traditional baked potato, loaded with stuff.  This would be especially good tucked down into some hot coals/embers on a campfire.  
Thanks for sharing.

A new recipe to play with! I added some extra italian dressing and it was definately good. I had made it for my family for Fathers Day. They all commented that it was good but would be even better with some bacon.

Great idea but needs more seasoning or a different salad dressing. I added roasted garlic and herbs to the potatoes but I found the Italian to be bland. However, I made some with Greek Oregano and Feta dressing those were so much better and tasty. So I guess everyone choose a dressing you love for these.

Easy and great tasting.  I used homemade italian dressing and have gone to experiment with roasting other veggies this way too.  Never would have thought this would be so good!

Did these in the oven at 400 and after 30 minutes they still weren't done. AFter 40 minutes I unwrapped them and put them in the nuker for 5 minutes and still not done. Maybe my potatoes are on strike? The edges were done enough to eat so we did, and they were very plain. Next time I'll nuke them first, THEN slice, stuff and season them, and bake. I think a par-baked tater will absorb more of the dressing. I will rescue these by slicing them the rest of the way through, adding more dressing and roasting them tomorrow. Might soak them in some dressing in the fridge over night.

My family loved these potatoes.  There were very easy to make.  I did precook mine in the microwave for a few minutes to get the cooking process going a little quicker.  Very good and easy recipe.

I have to say, these did not have a lot of flavor and I followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe I should have rubbed the potatoes with dry Italian dressing instead. Sorry Janet.

Used this today for our Mother's Day BBQ and they were a hit.  We also sprinkled parsley and Lowery's on potatoes.  You can't go wrong with this recipe and just about any spices your family likes will do well.  We used a fat free Italian dressing to cut back on calories.

Very easy; suprisingly tasty! I ran out of my usual ZESTY so I had to make my own dressing.  The potatoes had a very good flavor.  Make sure to keep the foil pouch tight- no holes- so the steam stays in.  We had one that dried out. :)

not bad for something a little different... when i made mine I also added some minced garlic like another reviewer... turned out pretty good... the only thing I will do different next time is cut the potato into more slices and add more onion....

Surprisingly good! I did add butter and garlic, and microwaved them for a minute each first. I also added diced green pepper. Next time I think I'll added a red pepper.

The recipe came out pretty good. When I do these I don't cut all the way through the potato so it stays together nicely. We make a similar recipe ourselves using chicken broth and worcestershire sauce usually. This was interesting for a change but we aren't sold on the Zesty Italian dressing being the best option for our tastes.

Fabulous idea!  In order to cut down on cooking time on the grill, I microwaved the potatoes a bit first.  For lack of having Italian dressing I used ranch with bacon.  It was fantastic.  As the pictures indicate, if you cut more slices in the potato you can add more onion.  : )  I can't wait to make this recipe on the grill for my family over Labor Day.

This recipe is pretty mediocre when you follow it as written. It has potential, but I didn't think the potatoes were very flavorful with just onions and the dressing. The potatoes were also pretty soggy by 40 minutes on the grill, so watch the time carefully. 50-60 minutes is way too long. At least on our grill.

They were good but weren't as flavorful as my moms gilled potatoes and onions.  I am going to use this recipes as a base and build on it.

Made these with golden potatoes, yellow onion and Wishbone's Brochette Italian dressing.  Used one onion to one potato.  They turned out great.

I did not have Italian dressing but I had oil and pepper spice blend that I used instead. So simple, and tasted great.  Took others' suggestions and softened the potatoes in the microwave.  The only change I would make next time is to make sure the dressing gets between the slices and not just on top of the potato.  Topped with a little parm before serving.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Really great! I baked these at 400 for an hour, but they could probably go for a bit longer. Next time I will try sprinkling on parmesan for the last few minutes.

Great recipe. Added a slice of lemon between the onion and potato and 2 cloves of garlic with each potato. Topped it off really nice. FYI I skinned one potato and left the skin on the other (2 separate wrappers) and the skinned one seemed to cook a bit slower. Both were cooked for an hour at 400F on woodchips.

I just made this tonight but I felt that Italian dressing was a little too strong. Very good though, s maybe just tone down the dressing! I will definitely make these again.

I just made these this past week and they were a hit with all adults and kids.  They were simple to make, looked pretty fancy (after the foil came off), and tasted amazing!  I'll definitely make these again and have already passed out the recipe.
