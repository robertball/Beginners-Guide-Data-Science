I actually used raspberry sherbet in this recipe only because it was cheaper. These are to DIE for. Honestly. One of the best drinks we've had in a long time.

Used diet cranberry and strawberry sorbet. Little on the sweet side for me but that s a personal taste preference. Certainly would be a refreshing summer drink and I can see turning this into an adult beverage by adding some vodka.
