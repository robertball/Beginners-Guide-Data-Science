I cooked the turkey that was taking up so much space in my freezer, but my family got pretty sick of leftovers when the gravy ran out. Dinner tonight HAD to contain turkey but I was longing for something different. This recipe is REALLY different and all of us loved it. It was such a nice break from the standard casserole recipes for leftover turkey. I didn't have peas so I left them out and I substituted walnuts for almonds (because that is what I had). After eating it this time, I think I will add pineapple another time. I am always trying to increase my family's fiber intake and I was thrilled to see the numbers. By using pre-cooked bacon, there was also no added fat. The ideas are endless and I was plesantly surprised by this recipe. Healthy and yummy! Thanks Doreen

Very good recipe ... of course, like most cooks, I modified to suit my tastes and food on hand ... first I scaled it down to feed 4.  I used 4 slices of bacon ... chopped 1/2 of a huge onion, 1 stalk of celery, 1 carrot, 8 oz of fresh mushrooms ... cooked; those to soften in the bacon grease ... added the shredded turkey ... then added the almonds, I also added pine nuts and substituted dried cherries for the raisins ... I didn't let those cook long because we wanted the crunch ... I added a few TBSP's of crushed red pepper flakes for some heat, added the rice and about 1/4 cup of soy sauce to give it some more flavor ... sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro just before serving ... fantastic alternative to fried rice with lots of nice flavor surprises in it ... I think I may add some shrimp next time ... we will be eating this again!

Hi,

I made this last night based on the reviews here and really I did not find it that great.

The only things I had changed was I used the precooked bacon, pecans instead of almonds, and cilantro instead of parsley.

My husband also didn't think it was great - it was ok but nothing special and I wouldn't make it again.  It seemed a little bland.  I would also suggest cooking some of the veggies first - the mushrooms take much longer - and the apples were sort of mushy by the time the mushrooms were cooked through.

I didn't expect to like this so much!  My husband, children and parents all loved it.  I did make a few changes, as follows: used a brown & wild rice mix which added to the "rice cooking" time in step one; left out mushrooms and peas; used chicken instead of turkey; doubled everything except the chicken I tripled; subbed pine nuts for the almonds and fuji apple for the granny smith.  It was and pretty with a good mix of flavors, colors and textures.  Maybe not fancy enough for company, but a great way to use up leftover poultry when you get tired of the post-Thanksgiving ritual of sandwiches, enchiladas and soup.

Fantastic! I didn't have turkey so I omitted it. But I did use Crasins, which were really good. A great base to just throw in your favorites!

This was an excellent way to use my leftover turkey.  I did 2 minor substitutions to use what I had for ingredients on hand.  I used pecans and cilantro instead of almonds and parsley.  The raisins add such a surprising dimension to the flavour.

Great Recipe! Even my very picky husband and kids ate it. I think it needs more meat to be a main dish. I doubled the turkey, I think next time I might even triple it. I left out the mushrooms, and bacon. I also used instant rice. (2 Cups dry)
But this dish has lots of great flavors. Great alternative to fried rice!

Yumm, this is fantastic! I love 'rice 'n stuff' and this is the best one I've made. Really filling and complex in flavour. Made a few substitutions and changes but it's basically the same thing. Used whole grain rice instead of white, sweet corns instead of peas, mixed  seeds instead of the almonds, turkey ham instead of the turkey. The ratios suggested by the recipe work out really well. I'll be eating this for lunch the whole week at work, and I bet I won't get sick of it. Good stuff.

I really enjoyed this.  The whole family did.  It has all of our favorite things in one!  I don't see how this could possibly feed 12 as it fed 5 with a little leftover and I doubled the veggies and fruit.  I didn't add mushrooms, and added 1/4 stock I had leftover from the turkey plus coconut.  That added a nice flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

VERY yummy! I did alter mine a bit, leaving out a few things I didn't like and adding a couple I do, but other than that it reminded me of restaurant style Chinese fried rice, only better!

Used brown rice (healthier). Pretty well followed the rest of the recipe the same as stated. More turkey would have been better as it lacked any real 'turkey' meat taste. Would perhaps double the turkey next time. Very tasty - liked it a lot.

I was really looking forward to trying this but unfortunately neither my husband and I cared for it. It had a really strange flavor plus it took quite a while to prepare. We took one or two bites and gave up on it. Sorry.

I made this with some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving this year. I used brown rice, trying to be alittle healthier.  My wife and I enjoyed this recipe, and will probably make it again. My kids, however, did not love the dish.

I was surprised at how well this turned out.  I made substitutions (because of what I had) like sesame seeds instead of almonds and my picky lids liked it.

This is excellent! 

I did make changes as I don't have nor care for some of the ingredients. 

I don't like mushrooms so they weren't included

I was out of any kind of nuts, out of fresh celery and carrots as well I would have liked to include them. 

I used green pepper instead of onion. 

I seasoned with garlic powder, Onion powder and celery salt. 

I put the apples in with the turkey to keep it from being mushy. 

This is goooood food! I really enjoy it, I wonder if my husband would like it too.. he's real picky so I try this when he's not home.

What a fun recipe!  While the rice was cooking, I chopped everything up lickity-split and had a balanced, delicious meal in about 40-45 minutes.  It’s colorful, and has a blend of flavors that kept my family looking at their plate to see what exactly they would bite into next.  Also a very strong point of this recipe is the flexibility of ingredients.  If you don’t have something…OR want to add one of your favorites…OR more or less of one particular ingredient, it would all still turn out tasty.  Thanks so much, Doreen, for sharing such an easy, fun and nutritious recipe with us!

My mom declared this to be one of her favorite meals after I made it this afternoon! To make it a little healthier, I substituted brown rice for the white and omitted the bacon. I did use leftover Christmas turkey for this. I'll definitely be making it again soon!

My husband had 3rds when I cooked this last night and asked for it in his lunch today! I loved the flavor the raisins added! I did add some thyme and basil for some flavor.  I am definitely keeping this recipe for leftover turkey or chicken and am going to share it with my friends!

This is a great way to use up leftovers.  Turkey is not inherently very flavorful, but when you add all the "goodies" in this recipe, that white meat will be gone in no time.

This was delicious! I left out the turkey because I wasn't in the mood, but all the other flavors blended so well together. Every bite was an adventure.

This recipe is probably tasty as written and easy to change up when you don't have all the ingredients listed, as was my case. I didn't have apple so used pineapple, no almonds so used pecans. Did not feel like peas so used a small zucchini since we planted way to many in the garden! Also used Better than Bullion base which I'm in love with. No raisins but did have craisins (dried cranberries). Party in your mouth! Loved it.

Made this dish with no mushrooms, and it was delicious!  Only problem, I had no leftovers! We ate the whole thing!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was okay.  I liked the savory and sweet together, but my family wasn't thrilled with it.  A little flavorless, maybe next time I'll spice er' up.

We make this dish often, and it's so versatile...you can put in whatever veggies you like, whatever meat...but it definitely doesn't serve 12 as a main dish! At least not in my house. Maybe 6 :)

This was a nice way to use up my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. It took me longer than 15 minutes for all the preparations but it was worth the time. I will start earlier next time.  It turned out great. I used all the ingrediants and doubled the turkey

Flavorful and healthy with all those veggies, but a bit too salty. I liked it a lot. My husband just liked it. My teen kind of liked it.

For a simple savory rice dish, I only sauted the bacon, vegetables, (mushrooms, carrots, peas, and onions) - eliminate all else; did not use raisins, apple, turkey, almonds.  Soy sauce optional.  It was outstanding!

This is a keeper...I will be making this again.  I left out the almonds and raisins and the chicken soup base, because I did not have any on hand.  I added garlic and onion powder to the turkey when I cooked it.  The whole family loved it!

This is delicious! I did change a few things I do not like raisins so I used dried cranberries, and I cooked the rice in the remaining chicken broth. My husband loved it, (he is a picky eater) he asked me to put the leftovers in his lunch for the next day.

Maybe this is good if you add just the right ingredients.  I decided to "make it my own" like encouraged on the recipe.  I didn't really like it.  Hardly had any flavor.  I added extra soy sauce and a ton of teryaki.  still.  not that good.  Maybe if you're an exceptional cook-it'd turn out great.  It looked like I poured the fridge into the skillet.

I thought this was good, but a little on the salty side.  I can imagine that the same ingredients (minus the soy sauce) would be very good with some sort of curry flavoring.

This was not good at all. It felt like clean-out-the-fridge day. The flavors did not go well together. If you want to make something like this forget about this recipe and use what you have in the fridge and want to get rid of, instead of buying the ingredients listed here. Will not make again.

omitted water, and used liquid from canned veggies toward the rice instructions. Substituted andouille sausage for bacon.  

Omitted carrot, mushroom, almonds, and  raisins 
1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and diced 
1 cup cooked, chopped turkey meat 
1 teaspoon chicken soup base 
3 tablespoons soy sauce 
1/2 cup chopped parsley 
Used andouille sausage - place in saucepan with the veggies in the beginning to cook. Bring the sausage to a boil with the veggies and rice, then simmer until done.

My picky husband loved this. I omitted the turkey as I was useing it for a side dish. It would be great with the turkey or other meat for a main dish.

Delicious, but it does take some prep work.
