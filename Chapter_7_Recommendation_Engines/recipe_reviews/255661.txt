This soup was good.  It needed a bit more flavor.  I added garlic salt, crushed red pepper, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I didn't have a sweet potato so I used two white potatoes.  I'd make it again with onion and garlic in the oil then add the garam masala to open the flavors.

Broccoli is the dominant taste, which I like!  I did not modify the recipe, other than utilizing veggie broth and it was very nice.  Quinoa offers a nice protein and some great texture.

I really enjoyed this soup! I did make just a few slight changes using what I had on hand. I didn't have Garam Masala and couldn't find it during my shopping trip but looked up a recipe for it and just used a pinch of each item I had on hand. I also used a splah of masala wine I had from another soup I made recently. I think the wine adds a nice depth. It was really delicious. As a "pescatarian" I do sometimes like to try Vegan recipes and this was a great one. I was surprised by the ease of making cashew cream. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!
