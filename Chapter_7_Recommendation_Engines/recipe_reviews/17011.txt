Iâ€™ve been making this bread for several years.  It is definitely a recipe that requires accurate measurement.  I only use 1 c. cranberry juice as the 1 1/4 cups is almost a guaranty for a cratered top.  I also use margarine, only 1 t. salt (Kosher) and 2 t. bread machine yeast.  (Be sure to take 1 t. from the 3 c. flour to use to flour the dried cranberries.  It helps them to mix in better.)  The result is always a small yet soft loaf full of wonderful flavor!

This recipe worked perfectly in my bread machine set to the "sweet bread" option.  My only complaint--and it's not really a complaint since I should have paid more attention to the title of this recipe--is that this really is a very tangy bread.  If I do it again in the future I think I'd like to add some sugar.

i will make this bread again. i had all the ingredients in my bread machine and was making the settings, then i noticed there was no loaf size indicated. i went to the computer to see if the loaf size was in the servings section. (i do wish they would set it up so the serving size always prints out.) no loaf size indicated so i read the two reviews to see if the loaf size was mentioned. review one said to reduce the juice to one cup, the yeast to two teaspoons and shake some of the measured flour with the dried cranberries. review 2 said it was too tangy for her so she added sugar. (i needed her to have mention  how much sugar.)  so i proceeded to siphon off some juice; skim some yeast from the flour adding a little flour back in to make up for the skimming. then i shook the cranberries with some of the measured flour. also i added 1 tablespoon of sugar. it turned out well. my husband, the cranberry lover, said there are not enough cranberries. i'll double them next time. o yes, i used the 1/2 pound setting and it worked ok.
