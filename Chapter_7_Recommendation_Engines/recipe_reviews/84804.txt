Loved this recipe!  I tripled the recipe and served them as an appetizer at a dinner party and they were gone immediately.  They were by far everyone's favorite.  It was also very easy to prep most of it ahead of time, then put them together in about 10 minutes when company arrives.

Great recipe! I always alter any recipe to my family's taste which was easy to do. I used frozen filo cups and canned chicken so it took only a few minutes to prepare this recipe. I tried making some with cheddar cheese topping instead of the sauce for a different taste/texture which was okay but the sauce is a great contrast to the spices in the filling. I plan to make these again.

I gave up on the wonton wrappers as they were chewy when cool. Used filo dough cups instead. Made chicken and sauce the day ahead. Will make a bit spicier next time.

Made these for a party, and they were somewhat of a hit. I loved them, but not sure everyone else did. THe leftover filling we had made GREAT chicken salad sandwiches. I moistened the filling with mayo & it turned out great! Real easy to make!

I made this for company and easily impressed my guests. They looked beautiful and professional and tasted absolutely delicious. The apricot vanilla sauce adds a wonderful flavor to the chicken. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I made these for a dinner party last night and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  Just a couple of points though, IMHO there is way too much cumin, that is the only spice I could taste and considering this is supposed to be "Asian spiced"...the cumin doesn't cut it.  Also, I could have probably made about 6 more of these with the amount of chicken I had leftover, so the recipe yield should be somewhere around 18 (not 12 as indicated).  Lastly, the amount of sauce made was too much for the 12 appetizers.  You probably could cut that in half.  All in all, I think everyone enjoyed them, but I think, if nothing else, you should reduce the amount of cumin to 1/2 tsp at most.

These were a hit.  I followed the recipe exact the first time.  The wontons looked a little greasy, but they tasted good.  The second time I decided not to spray the wontons with cooking spray and they turned out much better--very crispy.   Try them, you won't be disappointed :)

I made these for an Oscar Party, and they were devored quickly.  I've made them several times since.  I think you can squeeze more servings out of the filling than the recipe says.  I also didn't include onions because of people's preferences, and they didn't seem to be lacking anything.  One of my favorite recipes I've found on this website!

The presentation is 5 stars, however the marinated chicken was a little too strong for me.  I used only 1/2 tsp of cumin and I think the next time I make this I will only add 1 tbsp of soy sauce.  I loved the vanilla apricot sauce!!!!  It was real easy to make and fun to eat!

I made my own cups out of phyllo dough, I used a 13 oz can of chunk chicken & I subbed chopped bell pepper for the spinach. I  used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder & I added 2 tbp. of hoisin sauce. I served these on top of jasmine rice (I put a little bit of the sauce on the rice too) w/ steamed snow peas. We loved this dish...even my grandkids cleaned their plates! (for my infant granddaughter, I mixed the meat mixture in w/ rice & drizzled sauce over)

This was very good!  I did not think that there was too much cumin in the marinade, as I like the spice a lot.  However, as other reviewers mentioned, "Asian" in the title makes little sense.  The wonton is pretty much the only Asian thing about this dish.

Good stuff and I have to say, really fun to make!  This was the first time I've ever used wonton wraps.  They looked so pretty too, I wish I would have taken a picture!

I would definitely make this again, but I would make some adjustments.  I love d the marinade for the chicken and will use it again.  I was not a huge fan of the apricot vanilla sauce, it smelled so sweet that I almost didn't put it on the chicken.  However, a small amount on each of the chicken cups was fine.  I also forgot to put the spinach in, which I think would have made it even better.  I used a little more  then half the chicken mixture in 15 phyllo cups and had the rest of the chicken mixed with a little mayo and pine nuts for lunch today (which was delicious).  I may try a different jelly type sauce the next time I make these.

I served this for entertaining one night through the week and it was a huge hit!  I made triple the servings for a party of 5 and they were begging for more.

this was very good - could easily be a 5 star with a few adjustments. I think it either needs less cumin or more apricot sauce - i had to add some sweet chili sauce to make it taste less dry. Overall, a good appetizer that I would make again.

I didn't care much for the original recipe, but I added 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup sour cream, chopped basil and ginger and a pince of garlic sauce to the final chicken mixture and chilled it.  It made the best chicken salad I've ever had!  I served it in wonton cups made by cutting eggrole wrappers in 1/4s and baking them in a mini-muffin pan.  I put these out as snacks before trick-or-treat and they were gone!

I made this appetizer for a pot luck dinner and it was a huge hit, appealing to all my friends tastes (even the picky ones!).

Loved this! The sauce is a great contrast to the other flavors. I followed the recipe, other than I used wonton strips (prepackaged) and served over rice. Very easy to prepare! Will make again! Thanks!

This is very good.  I did cut back the cumin to 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp.  I  also used fresh basil and  a little more garlic, ginger and soy sause.  I also omitted spinach.  My picky husband even liked these a lot. I will make these again, as they are very easy too.

This was VERY good! I needed to make something with what I had on hand. So I left out the spinach and didn't use the wonton cups. Just served over white rice and it was delicious!
