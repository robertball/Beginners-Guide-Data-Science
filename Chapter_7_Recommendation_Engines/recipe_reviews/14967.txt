For those of you who thought the biscuit dough was a little too heavy, the second time I made these I used the mini frozen phyllo dough cups and they were trememdous. I also cut way back on the mayo and still stuck with a good jar of brushetta in lieu of chopped tomato.

Took these treasures to the in-laws' family reunion this past weekend, and they were a HUGE hit!!  Tripled the recipe since it was such a large crowd to feed, and they were devoured!
Read all of the previous reviews and incorporated several of them into the recipe.
1.  Definitely use much less mayo... just enough to moisten.  
2.  Green onion works quite nicely in texture, taste, and overall presentation.
3.  Cut bacon, then cook.
4.  Added a little garlic powder and Hot Shots.
5.  Bought 16 oz can biscuits b/c that's what the recipe called for... used the flaky grands buttermilk biscuits, cut them in 1/4's, shaped them into balls, then rolled with a rolling pin to flatten... makes nice little cups this way.
5.  Was having to travel a long way with these in the car, so I cooked them the night before, kept them in a cooler on ice, then reheated them in the microwave when we got to the party.  They turned out fine after their long journey.

Will consider using cream cheese/milk mixture next time that previous reviewer suggested.
May also try different variations such as 
canned chicken, pizza, quiche, philly cheese steak, ham, you name it!
Great thing about this delightful recipe is the  possibilities are endless!!

This will be one of my all time appetizers.  Actually, I can make an entire meal of these with a nice bottle of wine.  You can make the filling a day ahead, and then it takes only a minute to stuff the muffin tins and bake.  It sits well at room temperature, and I haven't found anyone that doesn't love them.  Cut back a little on the mayo, because it can cause them to become a little greasy when sitting around.  I make triple what the recipe calls for, and they are still gone.  BTW, the "per serving" amount means only one bite per person, and that just won't happen!  These are outstanding!

Yummy appetizers! As other reviewers said to cut mayo, I used half mayo and half cream cheese; added a little garlic powder and baked as suggested. Although phyllo shells are more expensive than refrigerated dough, I thought it was well worth the extra expense when I did a side by side taste test. The phyllo shells make this a flaky crispy treat, while the dough makes it so soft that the outer shell blends in texture wise with the filling. I prefer phyllo shells with this...I will definitely be making this recipe for my New Years Eve buffet. Thanks Kelli!

Easy to make and very flavourful. A big hit with the men.  These also freeze rather well after baked.

I took this to a party and it was very popular! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and only added enough mayonnaise to moisten and hold the filling mixture together, which was about 1/3 cup. My other changes to the recipe were to cook the onion in a bit of the bacon fat before adding it to the filling mixture because I don't care for a sharp onion flavor. I didn't have any dried basil, so I added about 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley (mainly for color) and a little chopped fresh sage and savory. It was a super easy recipe to prepare and the results look like you went to a lot of effort. I didn't find 1/2 a biscuit to be too much dough, I thought it made a pretty puffed appearance to the cups (I tried some with 1/2 and some with 1/3 a biscuit). Make sure your biscuit dough is cold for easiest separation into  layers. My only negative about the recipe would be that I have never eaten canned refrigerated biscuits before, so the slightly sweet flavor of the dough was not something I was accustomed to. Nobody else seemed to care. I did think they tasted best after standing for 10-15 minutes rather than hot straight from the oven

Great recipe.  Had twenty people over for Christmas open house. Made several hors d'oeuvres and this one was the biggest hit.  I separated the biscuits into thirds and used three diced up green onions instead of yellow.  I only used about 1/4 cup of mayo and put just a little more
swiss cheese on top of each cup. Thanks Kelli!

I'm giving this five stars as I truly believe it's a five-star recipe because everyone at the New Year's Eve party I took these to LOVED them. I, however, expected to love them and just thought they were okay. I scaled the recipe to make 24, used fresh-grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, fried and drained my own bacon, and used just a few teaspoons of sour cream in place of the mayonnaise. I think the bacon was way too overpowering and that's all I tasted (and I LOVE bacon!) I wanted to use the phyllo cups like so many people suggested but my grocery store was out of them. I used the buttermilk biscuits and by all means, definitely cut them into quarters! I couldn’t imagine using these in halves – that would be WAY too much dough for the mini muffin tins!! Also, be weary of putting too much filling in these… mine overflowed in the oven upon baking – whoops! Anyway, I will definitely make these again as, like I said, my friends raved about them, but I think I'll definitely cut back on the amount of bacon called for.

I took these to a party over the weekend and they were a hit!!!  I used turkey bacon and low fat mayo.  I received many comments on how good they were.  I did have trouble getting them to cook though.  I ended up removing some of the cups that looked cooked through and then finish cooking the cups that I couldn't get to cook through.  I also had a lot of filling leftover.  With a few adjustments on the prep., this recipe is a winner for me!  I'll definitely make these again.

Just finished making these for our New Year's Eve party tonight.  Fantastic!  This is going to be my new 'go to' recipe.  Here are my edits to the original recipe:  I made a double batch of the mixture...but eye balled everything.  Chopped up a whole package of bacon BEFORE cooking in the pan so that it cooked up faster and was closer to the size I needed.  Used about 1/2 cup mayo based on other's suggestions, 2 tomatoes deseeded, 1 & 3/4 c. shredded swiss, 1 med. onion & 2 tsp of dried basil.  I used the basic buttermilk biscuits (not Grandes, etc.)  I bought the cheapie 4 pack at Walmart (each is 7.5 oz). I did not cut them, I spread them out slightly and used them whole in the mini tins.  Ended up using 3 packages total.  This, by chance, turned out to be  the perfect mixture to biscuit ratio.  It made 30 total.  Here's a tip:  when you spread out the dough, lay it as a 'blanket' over the top of the muffin cup.  Add the topping and then move on (you'll need to fill every other cup or so and then go back).  When you go back to the empty ones, gently push the filled cups in so the extra dough over the top kind-of cradles the mixture and blankets around it.  They'll also fall nicely into the cup this way and will be easier to get out in the end.  Will be making this again and again and again!  Thanks!!!

Good base, but this recipe needs some changes. 

First off and most important, I NEVER use biscuit dough to make these.  It's best with the Filo dough cups.  Not only does it look better, it's easier since there's no cutting up the dough for the muffin pan.  Also, they taste LOTS better.  This also makes it easier for serving as finger food.  Much better option.

Also, the mayo can be too greasy.  You can cut it down a little, but to keep the creaminess the best option is to mix half mayo/half sour cream.  

TIP: If using the Filo cups you can also serve these cold for a change.  Also, using the cups allows you to find a few different fillings (chicken salad, spinach dip, etc) to also put in there for a great app tray.

These are a great appetizer and very easy.  Everyone loved them.  I made a double batch before Christmas and froze half of them for New Year's Eve.  I pulled them out of the freezer and heated them through in the oven - 350 for about 8 minutes and they were just as good as the first time.

These are fantastic!! I cant wait to make them again for our Superbowl party.. I made a few changes.. I used Turkey bacon, green onion,2 roma tomatoes, and shredded mozarella, I cut the mayo to 1 tblsp,seperated the biscuits into thirds and used a regular muffin pan... Fantastic!!.. I only got to have about 4 of them, my husand ate the rest!!... (update July 13th 2003)..I have made these over and over and have now changed from biscuits to thin slices of Baguette (like you would use for Bruscetta), it gets very crispy and is even more delicious than the biscuits, I think..

These are wonderful. I did take advise from others and used Phillo dough cups mainly because I do not have mini muffin tins and did not want to buy them just for this.  Used half of the mayo that recipe called for.  I made these for my husband and I for the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl (WAY TO GO BUCKEYES!!!) they were gone before the game even started. I will be making these alot in the future.  They are now on my list for the Superbowl party.

I made this recipe for several holdiay parties that I had and went to and I can not tell you all the compliments I received!  Everyone loved them.  This is a simple recipe that gets GREAT results and I will make this over and over and over and over...

The ONLY thing I did differently was to use a can of petite diced tomatoes (well drained) instead of fresh tomatoes which are not exactly at their prime this time of year.  The canned were delish - just be careful to drain them very well, otherwise your mixture will be way too wet.

I used ranch dressing to moisten, finely grated swiss cheese, crescent rolls cut into rounds, and green onions instead of regular onions. DELICIOUS! Perfectly delicious!

These were awesome and very simple to do! I used bacon bits for baking by Oscar Meyer and frozen mini phyllo cups that were in the frozen food section of my grocery store. I made the filling the day before and then added the mixture to the cups at the last minute and baked for 5 mins. I doubled the receipe for 6 adults and they were all gone!

These tasted fantastic and were a huge success at my party this weekend! I will be adding them to my favorite appetizer rotation (the few leftovers were still great the next day). Here's some tips and tweaks that I recommend for the recipe:
1. The recipe makes more filling then for just 15 cups.  I increased the bacon to 12 strips (1 package) and slightly increased the remaining ingredients, and got 48 cups from the filling.
2. I used the 10oz biscuit dough cans, and when I cut the biscuits in half, I ended up with too little room for filling and too much “crust”.  On the second pan, I cut each biscuit into thirds, and they turned out wonderful.
3. I used part green onion and part yellow – I recommend this for flavor and color/presentation.
4. I used half mayo and half Ranch dressing instead of all mayo, and only added enough to hold the topping together.
5.	I subbed mozzarella cheese for the swiss (hubby is not a fan of swiss).

These were great - a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Best Foods but someone suggested that Miracle Whip might taste better, I will probably try that next time.  The only thing that I would stress is that you make sure to get the dough down into the mini-muffin cups (with a pastry utensil or the round handle of a wooden spoon) before adding any of the filling.  Some of mine turned out with more filling on the top, rather than down inside because I didn't press the dough down far enough.  I used falkey buttermilk biscuits (12 oz. can) and it made 24 muffins.

I made these to take on a campout.  They were easier to make than I thought they would be, but my husband and I didn't like them.  The mayonnaise gives them a peculiar flavor.  We both agreed they would probably taste better with cream cheese than mayo.

Excellent, this will be a staple at all parties.  I too used the Phillo cups and the pre-cooked bacon.  Also, I used less mayonnaise and more cheese.  They were gone quickly and everyone asked for the recipe.  Thank you!

Made for Bunco party.  Yummy.  Everyone loved them.  I made a couple of changes:  Seeded the tomatoes, used fresh basil, used cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, and used crescent rolls instead of biscuits.  Made the filling a couple of days ahead.  Molded the mini muffin pans with the crescent rolls, covered them with saran wrap and popped them into the frig.  When ready to prepare, popped out the mini muffin pans and filled them with the bacon and tomato mixture.  Yummy!!!  Worth all the prep time.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Whenever I make these for an event, people literally hover around the serving basket.  These little cups would be a perfect thing to take to any party or potluck event.  So incredibly yummy.

The reasons I didn't give this recipe 5 stars:  First...the filling you make for this recipe is MUCH more than you need for one can of the biscuits.  You will easily need a can and a half of the biscuits to use up all the filling.  I have done what some others suggested and purchased the "Grands" biscuits instead.  Cut into quarters and pressed into the mini muffin pan, a can of these will accommodate your filling much better.  And second...I cook them for a full 15 minutes, not ten.  I've prepared these in different ovens for various events/parties/friends' homes, and it always takes longer than the 10 to 12 minutes that this recipe recommends.

Aside from these two minor problems, this recipe is incredibly good.  Definitely try these out.

At a party at our home recently, I actually overheard someone who'd just eaten one ask my wife if i was a professional chef! 

Note that these are made in a *mini* muffin pan. The only way this works is splitting each biscuit into fourths, balling each quarter, rolling or smashing flat and lining each liberally buttered muffin cup. (The butter browns these beautifully). I use a can of chunky ROTEL tomatoes and peppers - very thoroughly drained - and one clove of garlic. I agree that a half cup of mayo would be a little too much. I've tried both turkey and pork bacon and each work really well. I also agree with another reviewer that a few green onions would add some depth and visual appeal. YOU SHOULD MAKE THESE!

Great recipe! The only difference was that I added 8 oz of the shredded swiss cheese instead of 3ozand used light mayonaise...no one knew the difference :-). I have tried this recipe about 3 years ago and used the grands buttermilk biscuits, I had difficulty with the dough. Found that the pillsbury flaky layers buttermilk biscuits worked best. Thanks for this tasty treat!

I switched the bacon to turkey bacon, and the mayo to fat free, it still tasted wonderful. No one could believe it was lower in fat!

I wish I could give this recipe 500 stars!! My husband and I have made this many times. I have added a little green onion, sour cream, horseradish at different times and evey time it has turned out wonderful!! We have only made it using the puff pastry shells, so good. I made this the other night at my pampered chef party and the next day my phone was ringing off the hook. Everyone wanted the recipe, said they were just craving these!!  Thanks again for the great recipe!

These received lots of compliments!  I cut the mayo way back to about 2 T. and substituted cream cheese thinned with a bit of milk.  I used regular sized muffin tin, which made them more like a brunch item than an appetizer, but everyone thought they were great!

I have made these quite a few times in the past few years. Everything from a wedding reception to Thanksgiving!  They are very easy to prepare, (can be done even the day before and reheated that moment that you need them).  I found a mini muffin tray that hold 12 muffins instead of the smaller one at Wal Mart and that worked out very nice.

These taste delicious right out of the oven but I do NOT recommend baking ahead of time and then freezing. I did that and reheated for a party about a week later and they were really dried out. They were fabulous just coming out of the oven, though...

These were a hit at my party.  I found it best to make 3 muffins out of each biscuit. It was also much easier to separate the layers of each biscuit rather than cutting them and then reshaping them in the muffin cups. I used 1/8 cup mayonnaise and 1/8 cup ranch dressing per previous suggestions.  I also substituted some of the onion with green onion for color.  Perfect!

This got rants and raves at my party!  I was short on time so I used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon and it worked just as well.  I also used green onions, which gave it a more festive look.  Update...yesterday I made a simalar recipe that I liked better.  Look up "Bacon Quiche Tarts" and see my review

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any basil but the muffins were good anyway.  Everybody loved them and there were no leftovers.  Now I make them with Grands biscuits in full size muffin pan.  This recipe is also good if you skip the basil and use Pepper-Jack cheese.

I made these for a party and they were a hit.  I tried to make a few early in the day so I would have it right for evening and when I was finally happy, I rolled a piece of dough into a very thin circle, pressed it into the mini muffin tin and then filled with the mixture.  It was a very big hit.

I AM SO PLEASED THAT EVERYONE LIKES THIS RECIPE I POSTED.  I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD BE SUCH A HIT.  JUST A FEW SUGGESTIONS,  I NOW HAVE STARTED TO US THE PRECOOKED BACON THAT YOU FIND IN THE PRODUCE SECTION OR WERE YOU FIND THE BAGS OF PEPPERONI.  IT IS ALREADY CHOPPED UP AND COOKED I JUST ADD THE WHOLE BAG.  THIS TAKES SOME OF THE WORK OUT.  THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES AND SUGGESTED THE RECIPE TO OTHERS.

These are really good.  I took a few shortcuts and used a package of "real" bacon bits, a can of rotel tomatoes and mini Filo shells.  Delicious - would make them again

These are great but I found them too doughy as was noted in an earlier review. With the last of the filling I flattend a piece of bread a little bit, buttered one side and pressed the buttered side down into the ungreased muffinn tin. I got two muffins from one slice of bread. They cooked up perfectly, a little bit crispy and delicious. My next batch will all be made this way!

this turned out great, even though i made a bunch of changes. I cut the bacon in half because that's all i had, it could have used the full 8 slices though. I used green onion, sharp cheddar instead of swiss, and about 1/3 cup sour cream instead of mayo. I also used bisquick instead of refrigerated dough. Anyway, these were great hot or after they had cooled.

Try using flaky layer biscuits.  Separate the layers, placing one layer in each muffin cup.  Much easier and the perfect amount every time. You want to separate the biscuit layers immediately, as leaving the dough out for any length of time will make the separation a bit more difficult.

I guess I am doing something wrong?  I love the flavors of this recipe but I have two basic problems - I have a lot of the bacon mixture left over and my cups seem to flow over the tops of the mini muffin cups and become too large to serve.  I stayed away from the "Grands" biscuits and I quarter each biscuit but I can't seem to get the proportions right.  The taste is great though.

These are perfect to serve at a party.  Each time I've made them, everyone loves them, except for those who don't like onions, so I would suggest using less or even omitting completely.  Personally, I like the added flavor of the onions, but I think half of the amount called for in the recipe is plenty.  Another suggestion:  the last time I made these I used the Pampered Chef Mini-Tart Shaper (for use with a mini-muffin pan), and it made things go much faster.  I also used the pillsbury grands flaky biscuits and split them into thirds (or even a little less).

This recipe is great.  I first made it for my daughter's graduation party last summer and it was the first thing eaten by the teens. Since then I've made it on numerous occasions and changed the recipe a little according to what was already in the fridge.
We like it with less mayo than the recipe called for and with cheddar cheese instead of swiss.   Thanks for submitting this recipe!

As written a 1 star. Love these but cut the mayo in half or even less or it is a grease bomb. I use about 2 T and it is plenty. They are absolutely delicious! Edit: Good using a T or so inside a crescent roll.

These appetizers were delicious!  Instead of cooking my own bacon, I used half a jar of pre-cooked real bacon pieces to save some time.  And I used the little phyllo cups to serve it in, baking the appetizers for about 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  The recipe filled about 20 phyllo cups (not quite 1.5 boxes).  You can make the filling the day before, bake it in the phyllo cups and have a hot tasty appetizer in 15 minutes.

This is a good appetizer and you can play around with it. Use any spices you prefer as well as any type of cheese. I agree with one reviewer. DO NOT FREEZE AFTER BAKING. They tend to dry out. You can freeze before baking.

I doubled the filling only portion of the recipe and was able to make 60 cups (3 packages of biscuits) since I didn't overstuff them and wanted them to look more like mini quiches.  I froze them in the mini muffin pan, then popped them out and put them in baggies.  The day of the party I defrosted them and put them back in the muffin pan to cook.  Everyone loved them and they were gone super fast!!

My family loves these. They request them often, we substitute our favorite brand of chunky salsa for the tomato and onion. It makes prep time twice as quick and easy and tastes just a good.

I noted the reviews and doubled the recipe but didn't increase the amount of mayo.  I think one only needs enough to make it stick together.  Also, living in a small town on Vancouver Island means I can't always get all products.  In this case it was the buttermilk biscuits.  So, I used the flaky roles instead and divided them in three!   Also I used muffin papers since I don't like greasing pans and they worked fine after letting them cool to take off the paper. I will certainly make them again.

I think idea is a good one, but my first attempt was pretty bland. On the second try: To help the biscuits have some flavor, I basted them with EVOO and sprinkled with garlic before filling. Also used the smaller biscuits and flattened them out to fit. Sun dried tomatoes and green onions provided a little more punch. Just enough mayo for moisture. I tried them both as cups in the mini pan and flat in the regular pan, and everyone preferred the cups. I think I still prefer the ham cups with cresent dough, though. Thanks for something different!

These are terrific!  I have taken these to many school volunteer lunches and am always asked for the recipe!  I followed it exactly as stated.  I have substituted fried ground sage sausage for the bacon to change the flavor.

The look on my husband's face was priceless when he tasted these. The only thing I did different was minced the onions and sauted them in butter. Very Yummy!!!!

Wow, why haven't I made these before?!  As I was a little bit pushed for time, I used whole biscuits from a tube in a regular muffin tray. Worked out great. The tomato/onion/bacon reminded me of pizza, which got me thinking that you could really play around with any number of cominations - bbq sauce, chicken, pepperoni etc etc. Thanks, Kelli!

This was Awesome.  I made it for our tennis match and it was the first thing to go - everyone was asking for the recipe.  It was almost embarassing how simple it was to make!

These were very tasty and pretty easy to make.  My guests couldn't stop eating (or talkin about)them.  I thought the cup was a little doughy so next time I might try less dough and spread it thinner, or try those little puff pastry cups or phyllo cups.  Or even roll out cresent rolls and make it more like a pizza.  Either way, it's a keeper. The only think I changed is to use green onion instead of regular, makes for a pretty appetizer

This was a huge hit!  I used bisquick instead of the refrigerated biscuit dough and rolled it out to desired thickness.  I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved them.  Thanks!

I have made these several times and each time they have been scrumptious.
I always make the filling the night before and refrigerate it so that the flavors will have time to blend.  It takes no time at all to make the filling.  Last night I was in a real rush and even used the pre-cooked bacon that is available now.  It tasted great in this recipe and saved me loads of time.  The only thing I change about this recipe is I use crescent roll dough instead of biscuit dough for the cups because my family prefers it.  This is a wonderful appetizer and makes for a pretty presentation, also.  These cups stand out among the usual dips and chips. 
Really excellent!

Cute little BLT app. (without the "L").  I also cut the mayo to about 1/3 c., used extra sharp cheddar and the end result was still good...not one left.  I will try them with phyllo dough next time.  Thanks Kelli.

If you like the flavor of hot mayo then you might like these. These things made me gag. Not to mention the are not very pretty looking. Nasty! If you like the bacon/tomato combination....try a stuffed tomato recipe.

Good! I used less mayo and added in some ranch seasoning to the filling and they were really good! I also used Phyllo premade pastry shells instead of the biscuits, made it look elegant and was super easy.

One of the best things I've ever tasted!!! I added garlic because.... Well, I like garlic a lot. And I didn't have dried basil so I added a "herbes provecale" which I have been told is just a heavily salted herb blend from France. I ate too many of these! 
A quick tip: better to undercook than overcook. The dough becomes very tough if cooked even a minute or two too long.

Pretty good! Better than the cups/tarts that I've tried. It taste like bruschetta but in a cup.  I followed other suggestions such as cutting the dough in quarters, sauteed onions, and half of the mayonnaise.  I really wanted to buy the phyllo cups so that way I didn't have to do much prepping with the dough but the store didn't have any available.

THE BEST APPETIZER EVER!  I took it to 3 parties over the holiday season and it was devoured.  Everyone raved about it.  Like others, I cut the biscuits into 1/4ths, used only enough mayo to coat, and added a little bit of garlic.  I will be taking these to every party from now on!

These got rave reviews at the Preview at the book fair this morning!  I'm passing the link to the recipe along to the teachers!  Thanks for a savory, yummy "muffin" alternative!  I did make a few changes.  I'm a fan of cheddar paired with bacon.  I doubled the recipe and used half swiss and half cheddar.  I did not use the onion but sprinkled garlic powder on top of each cup (sparingly) before baking.  I will definitely make these again (especially since I still have filling leftover and an extra can of biscuits).

I've tried this recipe several times at get-togethers and other functions.  It has been a hit every time.  I use about a third of a cup of chopped green onions in mine.  I also use the real bacon bits in the package from the grocer, and I substitute sharp cheddar for the cheese.  The combinations are endless in regards to the various things you could do with this recipe.

Made these for a party and they were a big hit! They tasted great and were quite easy. Made these ahead of time by freezing in mini muffin tins, then freezer bagging, and returning to muffin tins for baking just prior to guest arriving. Will definitely add these to my collection of favorites.

I have been making this recipe for a few years and it is always a hit. The original recipe called for spliting the dough into thirds...helps for those who thought the cups too heavy and makes two dozen. The "flakey layers" style is the easiest to split. Make sure to seed the tomato. I also use less mayo and have used 1/3 to 1/2 cup real bacon bits in a crunch. I love cheese so I double what is called for and usually use a Mexican blend because I always have it on hand. There is no need to grease the pan...this is not exactly health food but why add more fat without flavor? Save the calories for extra cheese and bacon! So yummy!

This is by far one of the easiest recipes I have made. Even my sister loved these little cups and she hates bacon.  Much like me, those of you who dislike mayo BE WARNED. I added less than 1/4 cup of mayo and it was still very overpowering.   I will make this over and over again but next time I will cut out the mayo. If anything I will add enough mayo to slightly coat the mixture but I will use very little of it.

I made this 2 ways - with the refrigerator biscuits and with mini phyllo shells.  Both were good, but the version with the phyllo shells was clearly the winner.  The refrigerator biscuit version was a little too bready for our taste.  I also took the lazy way out and instead of chopping tomatoes, onions, and basil, I used my favorite prepared bruschetta from Sam's Club.  I made these for a party and kept them warm on a hot server, but they didn't last long enough to get cold.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are great, I use green onion instead of regular and Monterey Jack/Colby cheese mix instead of swiss. When I want this in a hurry, I make a pizza out of them by placing the biscuits together on my pizza stone and then pour the ingrediants on top and bake as required for the biscuits and then just slice and serve. Ideal for breakfast.

I rated this only two stars because I would not serve these as the recipe is written.  The filling is delicious, but the biscuit dough is just overwhelming.  It expands so much these are not "cups" but little biscuits with toppings.  I even tried using 1/3 of a biscuit per muffin cup and I still thought they were WAY too doughy (and I used regular buttermilk biscuits, not Grands).  Luckily I made them ahead of time and found that pie crust dough works quite well (and you can buy it pre-made so it's just as easy as using biscuits).

I thought these were great, I didn't have a muffin tin so I just made the dough into a ball and used my thumb to make an indent to fill.  Everyone loved them.

I used thawed frozen biscuits and cut them in half. I think I should have peeled that part in half too because these puffed up too much and made it where there wasn't enough filling. Other than that, it tastes great!

You need to modify this recipe. Per some other reviews I made the following modifications:
I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, and I cooked it in the microwave to save time. It's important to drain the tomatoes in a strainer to really get out ALL the excess water. I used 1/4 cup ranch dressing instead of mayo. I added 1/4 cup chopped green onion, 2 cans grands flaky buttermilk biscuits, 1 tsp dried basil flakes, and the swiss chees as directed in the recipe. I also used a silicone mini muffin pan. The cups popped out with NO trouble whatsoever. I would definitely use one when making these. I used all the filling this way. They were devoured by my guests!

This is one of my all time favorite snacks! They taste much better with a can of Rotel -- drain first. I also add a pinch of garlic powder and diced ham along with the bacon. Sometimes I add green onions for an extra kick and a few sprinkles of parmesan to the mix. There are NEVER any left! I have been using this recipe for years and saw it here...THANKS for letting others see this great treat. You will crave these once you have tasted them. My daughter requests these at least once a month.

This recipe is so awsome because of its versatility...I used chunky bleu cheese dressing instead of mayo, and 4 green onions. Also used colby jack for the cheese...Very good! And I cant wait to try this with other ingredients, like spinach, sausage, and tomato??!!! The possibilties are endless.....

These are very good! This recipe won an appetizer contest we had with our friends!  I use Grand's flakes biscuits (I think that's what they are called) and separate each into four parts.

Yummmmm... I messed with the recipe, though. I doubled the recipe and used five roma tomatoes, 1/2 cup cream cheese, 1/3 cup mayo, 1 cup cheddar cheese, about a ton of bacon, 3 chopped green onions, and I used crescent roll dough instead of regular biscuit dough. I also had to add a little extra salt. This... is... AWESOME. Definitely, definitely a keeper.

I was hoping this would be the hit of the party, but it really turned out to be quite average.  I still have more success with the Antipasto Squares recipe when taking an appetizer to a larger group.

I used 30 mini phyllo cups instead of the biscuits and chopped up three green onions instead of the regular onion.  Served these as an appetizer for Easter and all the ladies in the family left with the recipe.  Great stuff!

I changed the recipe a bit...I was looking for a way to use leftover Christmas ham. Instead of bacon, I used 1 cup diced ham, cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, and Italian seasoning for the basil. I also used full sized muffin tins. With Grands biscuits, it made 16 cups and my kids loved them for breakfast. A bit salty, but still delicious.

I love BLTs and BLT dip so thought this would be a winner as well. It is very good, however, I will use more mayo next time, a bit to dry. I also used a little more then doulble the bacon as it just didn't seem like it would be enough. I will make this again! This is a keeper!:)

Made these as a test before the thanksgiving crowd and tested on my husband and son. They are wonderful. Both loved them. I did reduce the mayo by 12. They were perfect. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was a big hit at a tailgate.  Great flavor.  I used small tart shells and they added some crunch.  Very good.

Not impressed. The mayo was too overpowering, even though I cut it down to 6 oz. As an experiment I filled the remainder of the phyllo cups with diced pepperoni, tomato sauce and mozz. cheese with fresh oregano. This was a lot better.

These are fantastic!!  I've been using them as a "standard" appetizer since NYE 2000 and EVERYONE loves them...I've even substituted bacon for the non-meat Bacon Bits for my veggie friends and they are still great!  The only down side is that if you're going to make them, make a lot of them - they take more than 10 mins prep (at least 30) to make and go very quickly.

Absolutely delicious, although kids weren't quite as crazy about them.  I made them with "Grands" biscuits and baked in full-sized muffin tins and served them as a side to soup.  Will make again and again.

I used mini fillo cups instead of the buttermilk biscuit dough. It was much easier and they looked pretty.

These may be the most popular thing in the world -- I actually have a nickname based on them. People you make them for will request them repeatedly.

I've been making these for years now, but I wanted to share a little shortcut I just created. If you're like me and have ZERO ingredients, ever, on hand, you'll love this. I realized that you can all the basic ingredients for this recipe (besides the basil and biscuits) on your average salad bar. (I have always used ranch dressing instead of the mayo). It's easy, and especially helps you make small quantities that won't use an entire bottle of dressing or bag of cheese. Bonus -- if you hit the right bar, no chopping!

I make these ahead and freeze them in ziplock freezer bags.  When I have guests over I set them out for a few minutes and then pop them in the oven on 350 for about 15 mins.  They are even better this way!

Am going to a July 4th party and "tested" this recipe on my family first. I too, used Hungry Jack flaky biscuits cut into thirds, rolled them into balls and rolled them with a rolling pin.  Also cut bacon before cooking (much more evenly cooked) and used less mayo and more cheese.
Result: Simply out of this world delicious.  Thanks to all who gave added ideas.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! I, too cut the biscuits into thirds. Delicious & versatile too. I wonder what chopped pepperoni insteaad of bacon & mozzarella instead of swiss & oregano would taste like???? Pizza cups!?

These were awesome!  They puffed up into golden brown little muffins that were scrumptuous.  I made them for the Superbowl and everyone LOVED them!  The only changes I made were the ones that were suggested on earlier reviews.  DEFINITELY cut biscuits into thirds (not halves) and I also used minced onion (thought that regular chopped onion would be overpowering also).  Lastly, I only had half of a medium-sized tomato, so I was worried that I wouldn't have enough filling, and it was perfect (made and filled exactly 24)!  In fact, if I had a whole tomato, I would've had too much.
Other suggestions:  Trick from a friend....for a recipe that calls for crumbled cooked bacon....cut up bacon pieces before you cook them, then they all fry up nice and even with no crumbly bacon mess afterwards.  I fried up a whole pound and froze the other half to use next time I make these!  Great recipe!

I loved these & thought they were a cinch to make, but I would definitely make more of the filling as I found I had to scrape the bowl for the last few biscuits.  The possibilities are endless if you use your imagination with the ingredients!

After reading reviews, I did this a couple different ways with the biscuits...but first off for the filling.  I used what I had on hand.  I used 2 roma tomatoes, 1/3 cup bacon bits, cheddar cheese, and only 1/3 cup mayo.  For the biscuits, I tried a few cut in half, some in 1/3 and some in 1/4.  If you are going to use 1/2 a biscuit, I suggest you use a regular sized muffin pan, NOT a mini pan.  If you cut the biscuit in 1/3 or 1/4, than go ahead and use the mini pan.  Don't forget, the biscuits will rise!  I like the 1/4 size.  they are the perfect size for an appetizer/finger food.  the 1/3 size is not too much bigger but not as "cute" as an appetizer.  The 1/2 biscuit is more like an after school snack size, or alongside dinner.  Will be making this again.

I use Grands(original or buttermilk) split horizontally for the cups stretching and putting them in regular size muffin tins. I also replace the bacon with BACOS so it's vegetarian. Instead of regular tomato I get canned (8 oz) diced tomatoes with herbs which is about equal to one tomato once it's drained. I cut in blue cheese with the swiss as well and sprinkle Adobo into the mixture. My family goes nuts over these and insist on them every Christmas.

Terrific!  We use a bit less dough in each cup, sub sour cream for mayo, and play around with different cheeses each time we make them.  Sometimes put an avocado slice on top, which is my favorite.  Have taken them to at least 5 different parties-  always the first empty plate.  Easy to make too, which is great,

These are fantastic!! Great make ahead appetizer and very good room temp or warm. Also keeps very well for 2nd day reheat. Change nothing in the recipe, it is perfection and you are sure to be asked for the recipe.

These cups are such a pretty appetizer as well as tasty.  I only used 1/4 cup Mayo & added couple spoonfuls of cream cheese.  Also added diced green onion.  Definitely cut biscuits in quarters.

This would be a great recipe for a brunch too. I sauteed the onion in the bacon drippings, used fresh basil,  4 small plum tomatoes and my own biscuit recipe. I liked the extra tomato flavour. Great that someone said they freeze well as that;s what I did after my taste test.

Loved these - took them to a volleyball tournament and everyone raved.  The green onion MAKES them.  I used a quarter of the biscuit for minis and half a biscuit for regular sized muffins - both were great!  I am going to try the filling with Hawaiian rolls for tomorrow-slicing the whole package open and spreading the filling on them, replacing the top and baking it - should be great!!!!

This is one of my "go-to" recipes for a crowd. My hubby's buddies all request this one when we have get togethers. Found this recipe originally from a PC party years ago.  I usually peel the layers of the biscuts apart and use them in the mini cups. They aren't as heavy that way. Also taste great when cooled off too!

Definitely opt for the phyllo shells - you won't be sorry. I made them with biscuit dough first, and although they were quite good, they were outstanding with the phyllo shells. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

These were good but too much dough as written.  Next time I will quarter the biscuits or use crescent roll dough, use only a couple tablespoons of mayo and add a bit of Asiago cheese along with the Swiss; very nice recipe with endless possibilities.

AWESOME! My friend made this recipe several times they are soooo good. I wanted to try something different when I made them so I changed them into "Pizza Cups" followed the recipe except I using ranch instead of mayo, pepperoni instead of bacon, and Mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss.  LOVED IT!!!!

I've been making these for a few years now. Everytime I go somewhere where I have to make an appetizer, people ask if I'm bringing these.  One thing I would add is that you do NOT have to be accurate on how your split your biscuits. It makes no difference in how they turn out. I've used little tiny pieces that I've had to piece together (even really thin ones)and they are just as good. Just make sure you really push the dough down in the pan and make sides (a cup). You don't need to be careful when filling either. Sometimes mine overflows and it bakes up wonderfully. You can use the mini muffin pans or the regular size. I've also had some leftover filling that is excellent when you put on a cracker! I could easily see this as a dip. Really a GREAT appetizer!

You can get SUPER creative with this!  Add chives, sauteed garlic, diced mushrooms, cheddar, green/red peppers, grits, scrambled eggs... the options are limitless!  You can gear towards breakfast, brunch, or lunch!  FYI... I cut the biscuits into fourths when using mini muffin pans.  It is PLENTY!  Be generous with the "stuffing"!  I also used real bacon bits instead of frying messy bacon (just as good).  Use Rotel instead of cutting a tomato and you WON'T be sorry!

So good!  I used crescent roll dough and form fitted into the cups.  I also used real bacon pieces found in the salad toppings aisle.  They actually tasted more bacon-y than using the real thing and so much easier!

These little treats were delicious. I made them for the Chritstmas GNO (Girl's Night Out) and what a hit they were. There were 8 of us so I doubled the recipe ... used the equivilent button and it worked out perfectly.

I didn't use the canned bisquits (too much work). I used the phyllo cups and they added a wonderful crunch. As some suggested, I sauteed the onions in some of the bacon renderings. That made the onion a bit less crunchy. Plus I used fresh basil instead of the dried. I baked them for a little longer than they said and put them on convection so the tops were bubbly.

Everyone asked for the recipe. They were a big hit. I'll be making them again for this holiday season.

These were really tasty, I'm so thrilled to add a new recipe to my 'repertoire'! I will certainly make these again (over and over) I think I'll try a touch less mayo next time, (purely for the sake of our arteries) and maybe experiment with different fillings. These were also very simple to make for a novice. Thanks!

Everyone loved these! They thought they were mini pizza's.  I suppose you could use mozzarella instead of the swiss cheese.  Excellent recipe! We didn't change a thing.

I gave it 5 stars because I know it would be just as good if not better they way written.  I used green onion instead of regular and cheddar instead of swiss.  I also only used one forth of the bisquit in each one, it didn't come all the way up the sides but was fine coming out.  I prefer less bread more filling.

Wow, these are wonderful!! I cooked the bacon in advance so they were a snap to put together. I don't have a mini muffin pan so I used a regular size pan and filled each cup to the brim! Taking others advice, I used about 1/4 cup mayo and sharp cheddar because I didn't have swiss (highly recommend this!) I probably could have gotten more than 12 regular size cups if I hadn't filled each one so full! These were gone before I knew it and I only ate half of one! Guess I will have to make them again soon :o) Update: I used one and a half packages of the "real" bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon in advance like I did last time and it tasted great too. I also bought a mini muffin pan specifically for this recipe to make them for a baby shower! I got almost 40 mini cups out of this recipe so it worked out better than the 12 regular muffin size cups. There was a lot of food and this was the only platter empty at the end of the shower. People went wild for these yet again!!

there aren't enough stars for this recipe! I did cut back a lot on the mayo, and in one batch I used ranch dressing, which didn't change the taste all that much. Honestly eveyone should try this recipe at least once. I took them to a dinner party, set them on the table, turned my back to say hi to a couple people, and when i looked back they had all been devoured, the plate only had crumbs left... it was pretty funny!! I loved them, and plan to make some for mothers day tomorrow.

The first time I made these I used monterey jack cheese b/c that's what I had on hand, all mayo, didn't seed the tomato and just used my Pampered Chef mini muffin cup tool-thingy to make the cups.  Second time I used swiss, 1/2 mayo, 1/2 ranch dressing, seeded the tomato, 1/4'd the biscuits and flattened them before putting them in the muffin pan - they were good the first time but GREAT the second time!  Everyone loved them both time!  OH - I used precooked, crumbled real bacon both times.

This is an unbelievable recipe and actually really easy (coming from someone who doesn't mind chopping stuff up). I made the mixture the day before I was going to serve these and I think it was actually a good idea because the flavors had time to meld together. I used a quater a grands bisquit per cup and could have used less as they came out with a bit to much bisquit but still ohhh so good. They were all gone pretty quick but it seemed like a good amount that one recipe made (I have a large family and they were guite hungry when these came out of the oven). Will definately make again and again!!

Well these were the hit of another party - and how can you not like these? I used far far less of the dough than called for. My pan had 24 spaces and I only used 1 7.5 oz can of biscuits. Used one large tomato, fresh basil, mixed blend of cheese, and some garlic powder to other ingredients. Also just scooped out some mayo to bind and I dont think it was the amount that was called for. YUMMY! I ate more of this than the main course! Thanks!

Recently made this again. I had some leftover puff pastry sheet and cut those into 12 squares; substituted a mix of asiago and mozzarella cheese - came out yummy! Thanks again!

These were very good.  I did add about 1/2 again as much bacon.  Make sure not to use jumbo biscuits, they won't fit in the mini muffin pan.  My family loves these.

These are yummy.  I only used half of the onion that it calls for, and I used crescent rolls intead of biscuits (that was all that I had).  I had to make our in regular sized muffin pans because I don't have a mini muffin pan.  They still turned out really good. My husband couldn't stop eating them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I made the filling the day before, which allowed time for the flavors to blend.  I used Grand Biscuits, splitting each one in half horizontally before cutting it in half vertically, so I was able to fill four mini-muffins with each biscuit.  They were a huge hit with my guests!

This recipe is Wonderful!!  I did make one change though,  I used flaky style biscuits and seperated them in thirds instead of halves so they were not so "bready", so I did run out of mix quicker.  I took these to a Halloween party at my mom's.  I had about 3 dozen of them on a tray and they were gone in about 10 minutes!! I already added this one to my recipe box! and plan on making them for my cards group.  Thanks!

This was a huge hit at a bridal shower.  I doubled the recipe and filled 30 of the pre-made phyllo cups.  I did cut the amount of mayo in half and thought it was perfect.  I used fresh basil.  Because I was making this for a bride who does not love onions in food, I just used a tablespoon of rehydrated dried chopped onions to give it a little onion flavor.  I will be making this recipe on a regular basis!

These were a huge hit!  I recommend using the flakey, layered biscuits so you can easily just pull them apart.

Football season - I made these today for a snack for watching the game. I used a medium home grown organic tomato and half of a medium onion (dicing extra thin and draining the juice from the tomato,with a little extra cheese and Pillsbury tender flake biscuits (10 Count). I seperated them into threes(When possible). I filled them almost full and had extra filling. I had so much filling I had to make a second batch - it was enough for 48! My mini muffin tin holds 24. Wow they went so quick - tried one - It was Great !!! Awesome recipe my husband loved them !!! He ate so many he was not hungry for dinner (well that and the beer - lol).Thank you for sharing - definately will make them again.

Easy and very taste. Made them for Carla's shower at Angela's. Use small buttermilk buiscuits (blue package). Don't fill too high because they really puff up in the oven.

Got raves when served during my dinner and my guests asked for the recipe.  I had some of the dip left over the next day so I decided to stuff my hamburgers with them before grilling.  Wow - just as many raves from husband and family.

mMmmM .. good! i made these for thanksgiving .. they were pretty easy to make and yummy!! everyone really liked these. I would recommend seperating the dough into 3rds or 4ths. i would put more tomatoes and more cheese. i only used a little bit of mayo after reading the other reviews .. oh and i used regular sized muffin cups and they turned out fine!

I tried this with grated pepperoni and cheddarella and just enough mayo to moisten. It has become a staple since my son has been in 3rd grade and brought to his class picnic.  Now all the kids ask for the pepperoni puffs !!!

OH mY these are so good! I planned to serve them for a party so I tested them first and ate the whole lot. I just couldn't stop. I made them for a party and everyone DEMANDED the recipe.It was the first thing to go. I used less mayo than the recipe called for - just enough to make the ingredients stick and added just a pinch of garlic powder.

WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!!!! what a hit, they dissapeared sooooooooo fast, no one could believe these were homemade, they looked really good and tasted like heaven, I did cut down on the mayo as suggested and added a little bit more smoked bacon and swiss, EXQUISITE. Oh and I also used my biscuit recipe (doubled) for this, and I got 40 servings, and I still got some filling leftover which I used mixed with some italian style tomato sauce for dinner with penne. 
THANKS!!! Moshi

Took these to a party and they were a huge hit!! Just wonderful. I cut the biscuits in thirds, rolled them into a ball and then rolled them out with a rolling pin (a big thanks to those of you who suggested this).  Worked like a charm.

These are so yummy and easy to make.  I followed the advice of others, cut back on mayo, used enough just to moisten everything, also added green onion. I used the Grand biscuit, cut each into 4, it fitted perfectly into mini muffin pans. You do need to stretch the dough a bit and stuff it with the fillings, otherwise the dough will spring back and you won't have a pretty filled cup.

This recipe is fantastic as a base however it tends to be quite plain. I made quite a few modifications and my boyfriend absolutely loved them. I used biscuit dough but sliced the dough in half and then spread out the half into the base of large muffin tins. I used double the onion and tomato and used half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of mayo. I used about a tsp.'s of garlic power, 2 tbsp.'s of parmesan cheese and then about half a cup of grated old cheddar cheese. I mixed it well with the crumbled bacon and I was sure to stuff the cups full as I only had half of a muffin tin. However, this recipe could easily make 12. Also, be sure to watch the cups closely after 7 minutes as mine were in for 10 and were a little dark on the bottom. Next time I will add some diced jalapenos and they will be perfect for our taste! Thanks for sharing!

Super simple and very popular with my friends. My one recommendation is to do each muffin one at a time rather than fill all the biscuit dough and then all filling. The dough will rise too quickly while waiting for the filling. The possibilities are endless for changing it up based on what you have in the kitchen. I noted the other comments about the mayo. I'm not much for measuring so I would say just use enough to make the ingredients stick together.

Flavorful, simple, and easy to experiment with. I salted the tomatoes and drained them to reduce sogginess. I added minced garlic to the mixture. Spoon the mayo on then add bacon and tomatoes. Add add scallions for basil. Play with it! This was great!

I did not use the same measurements, and used the Pillsbury French bread.  My husband and I enjoyed it, our kids did not.  I had an abundance of mixture and made a quiche out of it, by adding eggs and putting it into a pie shell.  The quiche gets 5 stars, and the cups get 4.

My sister has been making this recipe for years, and I couldn't find my copy of the recipe so I looked this up just to verify I had the right amounts. This recipe is always a crowd pleaser. I usually substitute cooking the bacon for real bacon bits from the store...makes the prep time even faster!

I took advice of other reviewers and cut down on mayo, added onion and garlic powder instead of chopped onion and used puff pastry sheets cut into squares to fit mini muffin pans. I meant to purchase phyllo dough but mistakenly purchased puff pastry.  They were the biggest hit at a New Years party! I baked 15 min ahead of time, kept them in a warmed casserole dish to transport and served at room temp. Everyone wanted the recipe! Great appetizer anytime!

Excellent recipe! We've made these several times, first as written, and then with suggestions from several reviewers.  Our preference is biscuit dough rather than phyllo. The biscuit dough in quarters or at most thirds added a nice flavor. We thought the biscuit halves were too much. The phyllo had a nice crunch but no added flavor.  The best additions for us were 8 oz cream cheese and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder. Since the cooking time is short, we also liked the onion better if it was sauteed until translucent before adding it into the mix. With these additions, we liked a longer cooking time of 18-20 minutes.  Thanks TABKAT for posting a great recipe!

These were so quick and simple to make. I used the mini size biscuits as that was what I had in the fridge. I bake these full size in a regular muffin pan for 18 minutes.  I used pepper jack cheese as I had no swiss and served straight from the oven.  The base was nice and crisp, the topping was so good too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love these!  I used real bacon pieces, green onion, cheddar cheese and just enough sour cream to hold together.  Put into phyllo cups and baked.  Served them at a party at my house.  The serving tray was 1/2 empty by the time it got to the table!  Will make these again and again!

Split the biscuit dough in quarters and it's still too doughy. Will try phyllo cups next time.  Used 1/4 cup of mayo and it was good.  Next time add more cheese.

I made these as an appetizer for Easter brunch and they were a big hit.  I used the packaged real bacon pieces and made the filling the night before.  The 16 oz biscuits only had 8 big biscuits so I had to split them in thirds and I thought even that might be a little too much dough because the filling was almost overflowing but once they were cooked like were fine and everyone loved them.

This recipe is awesome. Made these for a baby shower and they were gone in seconds! I took another reviewer's advice and used the mini phyllo cups instead and added my mayo slowly until mixture was just holding together. Very light, very yummy, and super easy. Will be making these often!!

This has been one of my favorite recipes for a while now. A nice twist to this recipe I use Filo dough cups (premade in the freezer section of the grocery store.)  Makes them a little lighter!

I thought this recipe was great but I did make a couple changes.  Instead of bacon I used turkey pepperoni and instead of swiss I used fat free mozzarella cheese.  I was going for more a "pizza cup" flavor I guess.  I also didn't have any dried basil so I used italian seasoning and garlic powder...again, going for the pizza taste.  I used a little less mayo (I think, I eyeballed it).  When I split the biscuits I rolled them out flat so the fit in my cupcake trays better.  I cooked them at 350 for 15min and they came out great!  OH, I also didn't use onion because my boyfriend doesn't like onions haha.  Basically I liked the general concept of the recipe.  I would have made it with the ingredients it calls for because I like all that stuff too...so maybe I'll do that next time.

My husband and son couldn't stop eating them! I used Grands biscuits, which I separated into thirds. I took other reviewers' suggestion and used only about 1/3 cup mayo. I baked them about 16 minutes, so they were nicely browned and the biscuits cooked through. Great recipe!

I made a batch of these tonight because I'm considering serving them at a baby shower in a few weeks.  My only problem was separating the biscuit layers.  Some were a little doughy but overall this came out well...let's just say there aren't any left...hubby enjoyed them!  I agree with another reviewer that they taste a little better if you let them sit about 10 minutes.  The flavors come through better than when they hot right out of the oven.  I do want to try them with green onion next time.  This is a recipe that you can tweak to individual tastes with different ingredients.  Enjoy everyone!

Very easy.  I used purchased pie crust dough which I cut into circles with a biscuit cutter, then lined my greased mini-muffin tin with them before filling.  Delicious.

I made these for a bridal shower and they were a hit! I added green onion instead of plain chopped  and sharp cheddar (along with the swiss) and also a bit of cream cheese. You can start with the basic recipe and change it quite easily.  I also made these with pre made frozen mini Phyllo Cups which made it so easy and quick to fill and bake when you pre-mix the other ingredients together ahead of time! This makes it a great recipe to take with you to a party if the hostess has 20 minutes for you to use the oven. Will make again maybe with a few more changes  :)

These were delish!  We had them for brunch yesterday. I did make them into the larger muffin tins using half of the biscuit.  I also used fresh basil instead of dried and colby jack cheese instead of swiss.  I could definitely see using these basic ingredients and adding things to it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I put the bacon, onion, cheese, and basil into the mixer bowl. Turned to stir speed, then poured in Marie's Buttermilk Ranch dressing just until the ingredients pulled together. I served with fresh cantalope chunks and brunch was a hit!

I took these to a party and they dissappeared.  I pealed the biscuits apart so I got 4 cups per biscuit.  The half biscuits were too heavy and a little doughy.  I added extra cheese too. Overall, really good!

Really good.  I changed it a little by useing cream cheese instead of mayo because I wanted to freeze some (mayo doesn't freeze well).  Also I tried havarti with jalapenos instead of swiss.  And I used maple bacon. Mmmmmmm.  Everyone scarffed them down, and asked for the recipe!

I thought the filling was excellent, however, I thought the biscuit crust was too doughy.  I think next time I will use phyllo dough or even a pie crust.  However, they were a hit at the bridal shower that I made them for and the hubby gobbled up the leftovers.

I did not care for the biscuit dough shell, as the doughy-ness overwhelmed the very tasty filling.  Next time I will use phyllo dough, as others have suggested.  For the filling, I used just enough mayo to hold it together -- probably about 3 T.  If made as directed, I think the mayo greasies would overwhelm the other flavors.  Less is more!

These are soooooo good!!! I used regular sized muffin cups - I ended up with an extra biscuit or two so I just split them up evenly among the cups. Everyone loved them!! Yummy and so easy, especially when you use a package of Oscar Mayer Real Bacon pieces!!

I followed others' suggestions and used pre-made bruchetta mix.  They were gone in a split second - will definitely make these again!

This was really good! I had used phyllo dough cups as previously suggested and I used a premade brushetta mix. I got tons of compliments and it was really easy to make! If you have any sauce left over, you can use it as a dip.

I used diced Italian-style tomatoes, some garlic and substituted mozzarella for the swiss.  I also baked them in a regular muffin pan.  They were absolutely delicious and got rave reviews from all!  I will definitely make them again!

I made these for a party last night and they were a HUGE hit. Gone within seconds! I doubled the recipe, and used 2T mayo and 1/4 c ranch dressing, 1/2 sweet onion and then used mozzarella instead of swiss. I also cut the biscuit dough into quarters.  I baked them before hand and then put them in the oven 350 for 10 minutes to heat up before serving.  AWESOME!!

These were a great New Year's Eve hors d'oeuvre.  Easy to prepare.  I made them with phillo shells instead of biscuit dough, which made them even easier.

I test recipes for future parties on my husband and we both loved this.  I forgot to get swiss cheese at the market so I used a mozzarella/parm blend I had on hand and I sauted the onions in a little of the bacon fat (mmmmmm).  I also added a little cayenne pepper and onion salt to my second batch - we prefered it with the little extra kick.  This is outstanding and I can't wait to make it for my next party.

Yum!  This recipe is sooo good!  I made these for my sister's baby shower, and everyone raved about how delicious they were.  In order to save time the day of the baby shower, I made up the filling the night before, and refridgerated it until I was ready to make them the next morning.  The only difference I made to the filling was that I sauteed the onions as personally I can't stand raw onions, and as I don't care for swiss cheese I substituted it for marble cheese.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and cut up the biscuit dough into thirds, and I found it worked perfectly in the mini tart pan I had.  They're so good, I'm thinking of hosting an appetizer night just so I have an excuse to make these again :)  Thanks for the recipe!

We love this one! Quick, easy, and uses readily available ingredients. I've made it twice now and made some adjustments. 1. We're vegetarian, so I eliminated the bacon (our fake bacon just didn't work). 2. Cut the mayo by half. 3. I used more basil, since we grow our own and have a lot! 4. Used more tomatoes to go with the extra basil. 5. Added chopped fresh mushrooms. 6. Used goat cheese! YUMMM! Parmesan works too. Like a previous reviewer, I can foresee making these cute little cups with all sorts of tasty fillings -- just think of all the foods you might eat with biscuits! Also, for the picky eater in our house, I made a couple of cups with just cheese. This is going to the next office potluck!

This appetizer was a HUGE hit at my monthly M.N.O (Mom's Night Out).
I used Grands Flaky Layer biscuits cut into fourths.  I rolled up the quarters and then pressed them down into the mini muffin tins. NOTE:Don't overfill because those flaky biscuits really rise.

These were good.  I did cut down on the mayo per other reviews to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have Swiss so I used mild cheddar.  Decided to have these as the main course for dinner, so I used 1 biscuit in each of a regular muffin tin.  Now I have some leftovers for tomorrow tonight.  Will surely make again.

You definitely need to use fresh basil and I also added cracked pepper.  If you mix the ingredients (except the biscuits, of course) ahead of time and put it in the fridge for a couple hours, the flavors really meld.  Thank you for the recipe.  I know these will become a staple in my home for parties and get togethers.

I took these to an "appetizer" dinner this weekend and they were a hit!  I was asked for the recipe from several of the guests.  I will absolutely be making these again.  I tripled the recipe except the mayo and then used 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. ranch dressing.  They were out of this world!

I have made this recipe many times.  Excellent just as written.  I have also changed the type of cheese to whatever i have on hand and it is always delish!  It also makes a great dip served with a assortment of crackers.

These are great and so easy!  I quartered each biscuit as suggested in other reviews and added a bit of garlic.  I think using less biscuit dough per cup made the thickness more proportional to the filling.  Great recipe!

I really liked the mixture, but I didn't really care for it in the biscuit cups. But I am also not a big fan of refrigerated biscuits. I think I might use this as a topping for bruschetta next time. Thanks!

I used regular biscuits and followed the recipe exact. The filling made more than enough for one can. Better buy an extra one. They were great! No changes needed.

These were so easy and the finished product is so cute.  My husband raved about them and they look fantastic on a fancy plate.
I cut back on the mayo a bit and used mozzarella instead because it was all I had.  Turned out nice.  This is a great recipe.

I made a few changes based upon past comments.  First I used real bacon bits and seeded the tomato.  This helped with the problem of getting the biscuit soggy. I also used 1/4 cup Garlic Ranch Salad Dressing in place of the mayonnaise (1/2 cup is too much). Next I used Grand's croissant rolls and cut them out with a cup. The cutouts fit into the mini cup pan perfectly. I also added about 1T of chopped green onion. These went so fast I would recommend making a double, even triple batch. Yummy!

Awesome recipe! I use a drained can of small diced tomatoes and omit the onion, the recipe is very flavorful. I also use Grands flaked biscuit and cut into quarters. Make sure you roll each quarter into a little ball then press well into the mini muffin tin, otherwise the topping rolls off when baking. They are filling and delicious! I have made many times now and have given recipe out at least 1/2 a dozen times. Makes me look like a chef! They are yummy and quick! Even my kids (ages 4-14) ask for them (and hubby too!) thanks--a KEEPer in my recipe book!

These are the absolute best! My husband LOVES them. I would recommend doubling or even tripling though! I also used the homestyle butter tastin biscuits.

I found this very interesting and easy to cook. At first I didnt have any muffin pan so i decided to use flat pan, and came out very succesful! I decide not to use swiss cheese so i used mild cheddar cheese instead. I cooked many times in every monthly because my husband said this is better than delivery pizza. Also, we found this better recipe because we like idea of the biscuit and I like the scent of basil into the mixture. Gave you 5 1/2 stars.

This is a keeper! I used pillsbury flaky buttermilk biscuits and tore them into thirds. I made them for a cocktail party and also for Christmas Eve and I received rave reviews from friends/family. There are so many variations that could be done with this recipe!

All my friends love them. I made them twice. They first time I made it like the recipe but there was a little to much biscuit, so I did as others suggested and used 1/3 of the biscuit & it was much better

Very famous at the office luncheon.  They were the first to go! Prep'd the filling mix the night before. Used precooked bacon (much easier!) used ranch dressing, no mayo, and scallions.  Cut the biscuit in 1/2 and pounded flat. Very Good. Thanks for sharing.

I tried a couple of different variations on this recipe.  All turned out great.  First I cut the biscuit into 1/4ths.  It was perfect for the mini muffin pan.  My pan only holds 24 so I only used 6 biscuts.  My first mixture was for the kids, only Cheddar cheese and bacon.  Second mixture was Cheddar cheese, bacon, and a small amount of good flavored spagetti sauce.  My last mixture was for me so I used Cheddar cheese, bacon, spag sauce and fresh basil and chives.  I liked all 3 of the variations.  I didn't use any mayo at all. Without the spag sauce the cup comes out crispy, with the spag sauce it comes out softer.

These were good, but not great.  I think the mayo needs some ranch or seasoning added to it to give it a kick.  Also, make sure you really chop the bacon and tomato fine because if they are too big they kind of fall off and they don't look as nice.  They all went, but I'm going to tweak the recipe a bit...

This was a big hit!!  I made them for a baby shower this past weekend and everyone enjoyed them.  I doubled the recipe and used veggie flavored cream cheese with only enough mayo to give it a good consitancy.  I also subbed colby/jack shredded cheese instead of swiss and used pre-cooked bacon peices.  Great recipe!!

Wonderful.  I made them with cheddar cheese and green onions. I also went easy on the mayo as suggested. They are such a great blend of flavors and you can whip them up so quickly!  I can't wait to make these for a party.

These were very good, surprisingly filling!  I used colby jack cheese as it's our preference but still very yummy. I think next time I'd use a bit less mayo - otherwise really very good!

These were very good.  I used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss because that is what we prefer.  The combination of ingredients gave it an unexpected sweet taste.

This is the most fantastic apperizer ever created.  I cut up a shallot instead of the onion (I was feeling lazy, and the shallot was small).  I used the dough that was called for in the recipe, and it worked wonderfully.    Maybe my mini-muffin tins are a bit bigger! My only complaint is that there weren't enough to go around.  I will definitely double or triple the recipe next time!

Why have I waited until today to make these? These were YUMMY! I cheated and used onion powder, bacon pieces from the pouch, fat free cheddar cheese and low fat mayo. These were still great. I think you can make your own changes and still come out with a great tasting treat. My mini tart press and cookie scooper from Pampered Chef made this so easy! Thanks for the post! These went great with our movie this afternoon!

I saw this recipe in someone's list and had to see if it was the one I know as "Cheesie Poofs". My best friend makes these at all her parties and they're always the favorites and first to go. Her recipe, though, uses crescent rolls. That can be a bit time-consuming as you have to cut the triangles. Making them with the biscuits sounds perhaps a bit easier...with the phyllo cups probably even better, crispier I'd think. Have to try it. In any event, these are GREAT! Make 'em, you won't be sorry!

Oh, and just another note from someone who has made these often: Do not get the big Grand's brand buttermilk buscuits and do not get the layered buscuits.  You're better off buying the standard little tubes (4-pack store brand).  You WILL need to cut them in half.  Push them in the mini cups pretty well and do not over-fill the cups.  The cheese will melt all over.  Follow the recipe exactly, and you should have no problems.  Let them cool slightly before taking them out of the tins so the cheese can set a bit.............

I have made this recipe several times and every time someone asks me for the recipe.  It is wonderful!  I use "Grands" flaky biscuits though and use regular sized muffin tins.  I found with the mini muffin tins (at least the ones I have) the filling all spilled out over the edge with the regular sized biscuits.  So, I find that the "Grands" biscuits (halved like the recipe calls for) fit the regular muffin tins great without the need to prepare additional filling.

AWESOME recipe!  I made these for a party, and they were a big hit!

Instead of cooking & crumbling the bacon I used REAL bacon bits. It worked perfectly.  I also used GRANDS biscuits, and each biscuit made 4 cups.

These were really good!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I bought phyllo shells in addition to the refrigerator biscuits.  The filling made enough for 15 phyllos and 9 biscuits (to fill up my 24-cup mini muffin pan).  Everyone liked the phyllos better -- the crisp, light texture makes a nice contrast with the soft, cheesy texture of the filling.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly except that I forgot the basil.  They tasted great anyway.  Will definitely make them again.

These were gobbled up as soon as I got them out on  the plate they get big stars from everyone!! I used 10 strips of bacon and used grand bisquets and cut them in quarters for the mini muffin  pan. I dried the tomatoe bits on a paper towel and made the suffing a day ahead of time. Thanks for sharing

Yum! These look gorgeous on an appetizer tray. Just be sure to get all the liquid out of the tomatoes, so they don't make the center soggy and use 1/4 of a Grands Flaky Biscuit for each cup if you don't want them too doughy.

First time using an allrecipes recipe but definitly a positive experience! These were very good and pretty easy to make. I followed others advice and used softened cream cheese (3oz) instead of mayo. The biscuits were a little hard to seperate but I tried to seperate most into at least 3'rds some into 4ths. The thinner ones definitly looked and tasted better (not so bready) than the ones my daughter only split in half. I used 2 plum tomatoes, alittle more bacon, no onion but added alittle dill since we all love the taste of dill. I will definitly makes these again!

Even though I cut the biscuits smaller than recommended, these were a bit too doughy for me.  Made with a little less mayo, I liked the filling, however.  I will make these again, but I will cut little circles out of a Pillsbury ready made pie crust.

This recipe is perfect as an appetizer.  I tried it out a couple days before a big gathering and ended up stuffing myself and not having any room left for dinner.  This really does taste like a BLT and I can't wait to make it again.  Making my mouth water just thinking about it!

This is fairly tasty.  However, I would advise breaking the biscuit dough into thirds, instead of halves - the biscuit dough was way too big, when it baked, and most of the fillinf fell out onto the pan.

Excellent and super easy to make!  I used a store brand version of Grands biscuits, eased up on the mayo and added more bacon and cheese. I made these ahead of time and popped in the oven just before my party. It was a huge hit.  One guest said they tasted like little Chicago deep dish pizza bites.

Yummy ~ My husband asked me to make them again.  Note:  I used GRANDS and had to quarter them in the mini muffin pan... they turned out just fine then.

Yummy!  I had some salsa left over and used that in place of the tomatoes.  It still turned out great.  I also used mozzarella instead of swiss and it gave the cups a fantastic flavor.

I didn't take the time to read more than 3 pages of reviews, but I made a slight change of (what might be) my own.  I did this in puff pastry shells, and am still supplying copies of this recipe to friends and family after my last party.  What a great idea that can be changed in so many ways!

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I cut the mayo way down and still thought it was too much - I would omit completely.  I did try it with biscuits - do cut into 3 for a less doughy cup.  And I tried it with the phyllo to - it was ok.  Can't say I will make this again.

These are fantastic! I have made these twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. The second time I reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup and used canned cressent rolls. Everyone loved them even my finicky 3 1/2 year old could get enough. Thanks for taking the time to share these little treasures Kelli!

Kelli, these are just great!  I did as some of the others suggested and used the flaky biscuits divided into thirds.  Also used only enough mayo to moisten.  My picky teenage granddaughter, along with her mother and my hubby all gave them a definite thumbs up.  No doubts what I'm bringing to the next Super Bowl party.  Thank you!

I have made these for several parties and always get the same reaction, "I must have this recipe!" I am so glad to have found something different to bring to parties, rather than the same old dip.
I have found that using the flaky biscut dough is much easier!

I made these yesterday and they were great! They're so cute and little and yummy. I could eat them all. I used mozzarella cheese and less mayo. They're great re-heated in microwave in the morning as a quick breakfast on the go. Thanks for sharing. *****

These were not as good as I had hoped.  I used biscuits from a can, but I think if I made them again I would use a better tasting and texture bread dough.  The biscuits seemed too heavy for the filling.

These were great! I made them for New Years Eve and they didn't even have time to cool off before they were gone. All of my guests LOVED them and I have been making copies of the recipe for them ALL WEEK. This is a must make for all future gatherings. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is INCREDIBLE!!!  I made this for our family party (45 people!) and these were the HIT!  I can't tell you how many times I've copied this recipe for others.  Thanks so much!
By the way... I was running short on mayo and added Ranch dressing with it.

Filling was really tasty! I was pressed for time so I used Pillsbury Grands Flakly biscuits and split them apart and put them into full size muffin tins(like someone else mentioned). Everyone loved them at our BBQ. Next time I think I would try it on cocktail toast squares, english muffins or those small phyllo shells available in freezer section of grocery. The possiblilties are endless as far as what to spread the filling on or in - the filling is what this recipe is all about!!

Made these for a business meeting my husband was having and not a one was left on the tray!

Although wonderful, I do agree with the post below, they tasted very heavy on mayo to me. I think I, too, will cut that and add a bit more cheese.  But a great recipe overall!

I used regular sized muffin tins, and did not split the dough in half. I also used turkey bacon,low-fat mayo, and canned italian style tomatos. My hubby and I ate them as a meal with a side salad. This is the best recipe I have tried on this web-site. THANK YOU

These would make great finger food for a party. I used fresh basil and a few red pepper flakes in the filling and topped them off with more basil. Will make again.

Not this time. However, their was so much tomato and bacon mixture leftover, I saved it and put it in my scrambled egg mixture  Sunday morning. It was a big hit twice with my family. Once as it was intended and second in an egg scramble.

I made these for myself. They came out really good. 

I followed some of the reviews and cut back on the mayo to 1/4 cup. 

Can't wait to make these again.

These were delicious!  I was in a rush and wish I had read the other comments.  They came out too big using 1/2 the biscuit dough so I would do 1/4 next time.  I ended up with so much filling left over too so next time I will be able to get 32 of these out of this!

I also used light mayo and turkey bacon and they came out just as tasty!

I've been making these for years and they are out of this world. A few changes to this make them better.

Tomato - Seed it 
Onion - I think Red Onion makes the best onion for all eaters.
Biscuits - Use the Honey Flakey ones and cut them into fours instead of halves. I double the order and get 2 and half trays.
42 minutes - expect to spend a little more time than that.

Love the filling, very tasty.  I used green onion, as suggested in other reviews, and only enough mayo to hold it together.  I made a mistake and bought puff pastry cups instead of phyllo cups, and they tasted good but were hard to stuff - the holes are small and the pastry tended to flake away.  Tip: chop the tomatoes pretty fine if you are using ready made cups.  I had filling left over so might make it into a larger tart for brunch.

Simple, yet tasty little appetizers.  I used a 7 oz. tube of biscuits and got 20 little appetizers.  These were very quick and easy to put together.  Definitely best when eaten warm from the oven.  No one enjoyed the warmed up leftovers.

These turned out delicious! I used regular sized muffin tins and stretched the dough over the sides and they turned out perfect. I also added green onion on the top as a garnish. I will definitely make these again!

These were wonderful, and I am not a huge fan of tomatoes, but my family is. With that being said, I felt like I couldn't get enough of these wonderful little cups. I did not have a mini muffin pan, so I did not cut the biscuits in half, instead I flattened them out a bit, and then put inside of a normal size muffin tin, and they came out just wonderful, and a bit more filling then just a bit size appetizer. Wonderful, and will be making again!

This is a must have appetizer at all of my gatherings and parties! Everyone asks for them over and over again, so I can tell you that I've made them about 25 times! I don't alter the recipe at all- there is no need to (unless you want to use fresh basil instead of dried basil- I've done it both ways)! These are simply delicious!

This was devoured within 1 minute of being placed on the table.  It really is that good.  I did what other reviewers suggested and I divided the biscuits in quarters rather than in half.  I only used 1/3 cup of mayo.  In the mini muffin pan I made 24 of these.  I served at room temperature and they were still delicious.  Definitely an easy and delicious option to bring to a party.

I thought these were great...my boyfriend thought they were just ok.  I used green onions and cheddar cheese and those were the only changes I made.  I did have to bake them for almost double the amount of time as suggested, but it could just be my oven because I didn't see anyone else having that problem.  I do agree with other reviewers that you can probably split each biscuit into thirds.  If I ever made these again I would definitely do that.

i don't eat red meat or dairy - but enjoy cooking for those who do - so i didn't actually try these.  however, they were a HUGE hit the first time i made them.  i ended up giving away the filling i had left over and wrote down the recipe for six people.  they were the first appetizer to disappear at the last party i brought them to and have been raved about every time i've made them.

Yummy!  I didnt have mini muffin pans so I used cupcake size tins and used a whole buttermilk biscuit (the kind in the skinny roll not like the huge Pillsbury ones)  I thought it was wonderful I didnt have any basil so I used garlic I also used about half the mayo like everyone else said to do... it made a great brunch for my boyfriend and I! I will be making them again

Very good, lots of compliments from my guests.  I did cut the jumbo biscuits into fourths, though, and I used swiss instead of gruyere (less expensive) and placed fresh basil on top - that was the kicker!

This was so delicious, I made them for a vegitarian friend and used the "fake"bacon bits instead and it was just as good as with real bacon. This is a regular party staple for me now!

A little doughy but the flavor is ridiculous.  My thighs hate you.

I have made these twice now as a dinner meal with a different variation each time. The first time I made them in full-sized muffin pans and placed a whole biscuit in each cup. I used doubled monterey jack instead of swiss. It was excellent!
The second time I made this, I used fresh basil from my garden (which required doubling the amount) and split the biscuits in half per each full-size muffin cup. I used a generous 4 oz. of mozzarella and extra thick bacon made very crispy. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My husband requested this be added to the regular rotation of meals, which is rare.

Have made these many times now - every time, someone asks me for the recipe!  Easy, good warm or room temperature -- not even bad cold!  Great appetizer.

These were fabulous.  I wasn't sure about the dough amount after reading the reviews but 1/2 in each cup was fine.  The party I took these to had a vegetarian so next time I'll do all veggies. I'm sure it will still be great.

Been making these for a few years now and yes don't use the buttermilk dough use a flakey biscut or phyllo. Also I would not recomend cutting back on the mayo, but seed the tomatos it will be much less moisture when all mixed and put the bacon in the oven to cook until crispy then chop well- I have added things like spinach, aspargus tips when in season, squash- anything that is fresh at the time.

I have made these a few times now but have made a few alterations: I use  Sanitariums "Bacon" Rashers, sometimes I use onion sometimes I use green onion, I use what cheese I have on hand (once I made these with feta cheese and added kalamata olives!) I use 1/3 of a cup of sour cream and  two tablespoons of mayo. I have yet to use Biscuit dough! I use either puff pastry or an herb pie pastry. Also, I use a regular muffin tin. These are absolutely fabulous! And they are good cold too.

These were tasty, I used a medium muffin cup and half a biscuit in each. (the biscuit did not totally bake)   Also I would push it up the sides which I did not do. So probably a small muffin cup and some pushing would make these very nice.  Thanks TABKAT, I will make them again...Joanne

this is an excellent party appetizer. you can actually make these with any kind of filling. as i live in the middle-east where buttermilk dough is not available, i used puff pastry dough. i rolled out the puff pastry, cut it in circles and put them in a greased cupcake tin. i then added the stuffing (i made a batch with the stuffing above using minced beef instead of pork and another batch with chicken). everyone who tried it loved it!

I have made these for 2 different parties, and still have not tasted them...they were devoured before I got to them!!!  That speaks for itself.  Easy to prepare and received huge compliments from guests.  Will eat one before I serve them the next time....cannot wait to try them!!!

These were pretty good.  I love bacon and tomato together, so this recipe was right up my alley.  They came out nice and gooey on the inside, with the nice fluffy biscuit crust on the outside.  Next time I may do half mayo and half sour cream.  I think I would like it better that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I had to hand out the recipe. Since the biscuits seemed to be a flop with most reviewers I used one sheet of puff pastry cut into small squares. The puff pastry took longer than 12 min. to get golden brown. Will make again.

YUM!  Kinda reminds me of a BLT without the lettuce.  Watch them closely, mine weren't burnt on the bottom but the biscuit was a little more "done" that I would have liked.

This is definitely one of those recipes that you need to be prepared to share because everyone will ask for it.  I've made these countless times and they've become a Thanksgiving tradition on the app trays I serve while making dinner.  I also suggest reducing the mayo (they are quite rich as it is!) and experiment with cheeses.  I've used several different kinds.  A meatless bacon also works beautifully.  Wonderful recipe!

These were good but seemed like they could use a bit more seasoning or something.  I took them to a party and people did seem to enjoy them.  I substituted prepared mini phyllo cups as suggested by other reviewers and only used enough mayo to moisten the mixture.  If I make these again I will definitely use something to season them up a bit though.

I make something similar to these using phyllo shells, shredded mozzarella, diced fresh tomatoes, lots of garlic, and of course the mayo. They are fantastic.

I have made this recipe often, since it is so quick and easy! Instead of a mini-muffin pan, I use a regular size, and I also substitute tomato for a 10-oz can of Rotel tomato w/ basil. Our family likes the cheddar/mozzarella blend cheese, and once they are baked, they're easy to freeze! We take them with us on road trips and picnics. Super recipe!!!

Good with less mayo (about half), 1/2 cup real bacon bits, and two sun-dried tomato halves snipped into little pieces (plus the basil and cheese).  Used scissors to cut whole (not halved) buttermilk biscuits into quarters then pressed each piece into mini muffin cup.  I plan to make them this way again.

I've been making this for years.  Friends and family always ask me to bring this to the party. I use a mini-muffin tin and the key is to use Grans Flaky Biscuits.  Pull upart the biscuits into 3 sections.  Then each biscuit makes 3 cups.  Sometimes I lay low on the onions (hubby hates them) and use onion powder instead.  But I always add garlic.

I used phyllo cups, would probably use cresent roll dough next time and a little less onion.  Very tasty though.  Used 1/4 cup mayo, just enought to moisten.

I made this for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit! Nice easy recipe with simple ingredients. I didn't want to chop up a tomato so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and it worked great, just be sure to drain it well. I'll keep this one around for a long time. Great one!

Great! I made it for a Thanksgiving luncheon and they were eaten right away. Changes I made: used turkey bacon, sharp cheddar instead of Swiss, 45 mini phyllo cups (found in the freezer section) instead of biscuit dough, and used just enough low-fat mayonnaise to mix everything together.

I'm so in love with these! I usually have the ingredients on hand, and I've traded frying my own bacon to using real bacon bits from the jar! Can't get any easier then this!

Out of this world! Everyone who has eaten them has loved them.  After reading the reviews, I used ranch dressing instead of mayonnaise.  My daughter made a low-fat version for a school project, using turkey bacon, low-fat ranch dressing and 100 calorie biscuits and it still tasted great.

Great! I tripled the recipe and we had some left over, but the party-goers asked to take the leftovers home! I had to use the Grands biscuits and ended up having to cut the biscuits into quarters. These were a big hit. It took awhile since I tripled it, but worth the effort. Definitely a keeper!

Yum! Yum!  I got tons of compliments on this one.  Only thing I need to say is use regular biscuits, not grand biscuits...they will have too much dough for your cups!

These were incredible.  They were perfectly tasty and just the right size.  I did not slice the biscuits horizontally (that seemed difficult).  I just pulled them apart and smooshed them into the muffin tins.  Worked great.  I also used sweet vidalia onion and think that made a difference.  Had a big party and these were a HUGE hit.

I made them over the weekend. I had to make a second batch because everyone loved it. I did make a few changes. I add some finely chopped red and green peppers (adds color and flavor). I also cut the biscuit dough in half, and used the other half as a top.  They turned out awesome, like a meaty filled cupcake. YUM!

These cups are so yummy!!  After reading some of the reviews, I reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup and added 2 Tbsp of sour cream.  I found the consistency to be just right.  I also mixed in shredded Romano/Parmesan to go along with the swiss cheese.  I let the mixture sit in the fridge for about an hour to really get the flavors combined.  We loved them!

I made these to take to a new years party but as soon as i would get a batch done they were gone thanks to my brother and uncles. :) I added Ranch dressing and sour cream to mine. I put equal parts mayo, ranch and sour cream. It gave them a little tang that was nice. The liquids bake down and into the dough giving the canned biscuits a good flavor. Definitely has a permanent place in my personal cook book.

These ROCK!!!  I made them for my dad's birthday party, I made the filling the night before.  Everyone wanted to know what was in them.  I did put ranch in them like other suggested and cut down on mayo, they would have been to wet other wise.  But over all YUMMO!!!

I used 2 7.5 oz packages of small dinner rolls.  I cut them each in half horizontally and made 24 cups, with 6 dinner rolls left over.  I baked them for about 13 minutes but should have left them in another couple of minutes.  I would have prefered them with more of a well-done, almost crispy texture.  I also think that cheddar cheese would have been better.

Yummo!

I had to try this one after reading all the reviews and thought it was pretty good and super easy to make.  I would have given it a 5 but since I made modifications I didn't and don't believe everyone would love this; however, my hubby is a tough critic and he really liked them.
Based on others feedback I did change up the recipe a bit - I did use some green onions with the regular onion (about the same amount as called for when combined), I do not like Swiss Cheese so I used Mozarella, I also cut up my bacon prior to cooking and used a 12oz. pkg of center cut bacon, I added 1/4 tsp of basil and 1/4 tsp of a basil mix (used for dipping bread with olive oil)and lastly I bought one can of 10 biscuits and divided the layers into thirds.  I think dividing into fourths would not be enough bisquit and more would be too much.  I also did like other readers and just mixed in the mayo by eye until the mixture stuck together.  Still a little on the greasy side to me but again hubby loved them.
My girlfriend and I cater part time and will definitley incorporate this into one of our offerings!

I think this is a great base to use for different meats, cheeses and seasonings and I really think that browned ground beef and cheddar cheese with a little taco seasoning would be great - I will try that next time.
Thanks for the recipe!

little bites of heaven. I thought these were absolutely fantastic! I only used enough mayo to moisten the mix as suggested by another reviewer, and I quartered my biscuits and used a mini muffin tin. Next time I'll use more bacon too. These were so yummy! A little bit of a pain, but the result is worth it! great finger food to take to partys!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party, and they were GONE in less than an hour.  I cut up french bread, toasted it with garlic butter in the oven, then added the bacon combination on top of that.  I baked it according to directions, and IT WAS FABULOUS!!!  The only other thing I changed is that I added half ranch dressing/half mayo.  I did use green onions, too.  Very delicious, and everyone asked for the recipe!  Thank you for a great appetizer recipe!!

I used a 1/8c of mayo and a 1/8c of ranch dressing instead.  I cut down on the onion and used grands flaky biscuitscut into quarters.  These were the first to go at our New Year's party and I've shared the recipe already.

These are great!  They have a great, full flavor.  They were a definite hit at my party, and I will definitely make them again.  I used only about half the mayo, as we don't like a lot of mayo, and it was plenty!  Thanks for a great party staple!

These are awesome! I hosted a huge baby shower and made about a hundred. Following the advice of many others, I split the biscuits in halves using my thumbs. I also rolled the biscuits out a little. Had to go easy on the filling b/c my first batch bubbled over. 

I did make these about a week in advance but they froze and reheated with no problem. The only turn-off for me was they were a tad bit greasy. (But who said it was a health food, right!?) Also tried this with turkey bacon and it wasn't as good. The turkey bacon added a sweet taste that just seemed to clash with the other flavors. 

Overall, these are worth the time and effort as a finger food. I will be saving this recipe but in the future, I will probably make them in a regular sized muffin tin.

I combined all indredients except the mayonaise and cheese and divided it into four separate containers.  

In two containers, I used Extra Sharp Cheddar.  In one of those I used Mayonnaise and in the other Ranch Dressing.  In the other two containers I added Shredded Swiss and used Mayonnaise in one and Ranch Dressing in the other.

So I ended up with:
Shredded Extra Sharp Cheese w/Ranch
Shredded Extra Sharp Cheese w/Mayonnaise
Shredded Swiss Cheese w/Ranch
Shredded Swiss Cheese w/Mayonnaise

They turned out beautifully and they certainly tasted good.  But frankly, I couldn't tell one from the other.  

My opinion is that they while they are good; they aren't as great as the reviews make them out to be.  It's possible that my expectations were too high to begin with.

I would definitely make them again but I wouldn't be as excited as I was to make these!  LOL....I think this is just a case like when people rave over a movie and when you finally get to see it, you go, "It was ok."

Thanks for sharing this recipe...

these were really good but I think I will use less biscuit next time. The whole family enjoyed them. I will make again. I bet this filling would be great on pizza dough as well.

These got mixed review over the holiday. People either loved them or hated them. I did cut back on the mayo but the main complaint was the mayo taste. Might make again and play around with th recipe, but won't make again as is. I personally liked them, but I am a mayo lover..

I'm looking for some new things to make for our Christmas Eve gathering and thought these sounded good and saw the high ratings.  Although they are pretty good I don't think they will be on the menu.  I think they would be better with another kind of crust.  The biscuits puffed up even though I went back and pressed them down several times before putting in the filling.  That made the crust seem too thick.  They are pretty good but won't make my list of favorites.

Like suggested, I only used enough mayo to hold it together and was pleased with the consistency. These held up beautifully in transit and went over well at a baby shower, although for the personal tastes of those on my household, I think I'll try a different cheese next time.

Great recipe!  Used sharp cheddar instead of swiss for more of a halloween presentation.  Also, used fresh basil which look pretty, as well as, tasted great.  Found that using butter to prepare the cups made the biscut dough easier to work with.  When I used spray the dough just seemed to slide around and not hold to the cup.  Both work just as easily for removal.  They looked pretty, were easy to transport and were a huge hit.

I usually do not like to rate recipes when I alter the original too much.  I made a lot of changes and my rating of 4 stars reflects this.  I used phyllo cups to start and I used half the mayo called for, 1/4c ranch and 1 can of rotel.  I like these and I felt that this way was less time consuming to make these quickly.  I do find rotel a bit on the spicy side, but Im wimpy when it comes to heat LOL.  I had many compliments on them and most did not find them too hot at all, they thought it was just enough spice/heat to know its there but not overpowering.  I am definitely going to make these again for another party and try it with regular tomatoes instead of rotel.

I used one tube of Grands Buttermilk biscuits divided into balls to fill 2 dozen mini-muffin tins. They turned out delicious. Thanks to whoever suggested using less mayo - I used my 1/4 cup measuring cup and filled it half with mayo & half with HV Ranch dressing. Also, I have a little tool from the Pampered Chef for mini-muffin tins. It is a little wooden thingy that you press into the balls of dough to make a dough cup. Just dip the end in flour & press for the perfect little cups. Yum!

This was a quick easy recipe.  The taste of mayonaisse was too strong for my taste.  So, I will definately cut back on it next time.  I also used whatever shredded cheese I had in the fridge and it tasted fine.  I don't have a mini muffin tin, so I used the whole size biscuit (I used Stop and Shop Buttermilk biscuits which are small) and made 12 with the entire mixture.

These are easy and yummy! A friend uses Grands Flakey Biscuits so that is what I used.  I cut each biscuit into quarters and used 3/4 cup of shredded Swiss cheese.  I also added a tsp. of garlic powder.

The concept is great but I think I may have bought the wrong size biscuits. Maybe the grands would have formed a cup since they are larger. I substituted the bacon for fake bacon by morning star farms. You can't even tell the difference. I am a meat eater and my vegetarian friends love it!

I used real bacon bits, & I tore my biscuits into thirds, being sure to press them down into the muffin cups firmly. I started out w/ 1/4 cup of mayo (I used lite) & added more, until it looked moist enough to me. And I used a shredded Colby/Monterey Jack blend of cheese. My guests loved these...thnaks!

Good.  A little too much biscuit.  Next time I will follow advice of others and cut biscuits into thirds.  I did add a little dry ranch dressing to mayo for added flavor.

These were good!  I doubled the recipe, and used half cream cheese, half light mayo.  I used about 1/4 cup of finely chopped green onions instead of regular onions. I will definitely make these again sometime.

These were really tasty and really easy.  I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with 24 cups, more than the original recipe called for (I used a 12 count mini muffin pan).  Good thing I had an extra tube of biscuits!

Everybody loved these, and they look really cute on the table. I cut the biscuits into thirds and used sharp cheddar instead of swiss. I also used chopped green onion. I love that is so versatile.

First time I made them according to directions, all the dough just overpowered all the good flavors. Second time I made them, I cut the dough in fourths and it was perfect. Very very good....I'll definitely make them again.

I LOVE this recipe and make them all the time. Everyone always goes crazy over them! The other day I doubled the recipe but still had tons of filling left over, so I butterflied chicken breasts and stuffed the inside and covered the top w/ the filling. It was fantastic!!

Don't be discouraged when working with the dough.  I kept trying to press the dough into those little cups perfectly and it kept sliding back to where it wanted to go anyway.  They baked up wonderfully and everyone loved them.  I will make these again, only next time I will do as others suggested and use less dough in each mini cup.

I made these for a party and everyone raved at how delicious they were.  I used cheddar cheese b/c that is what I had on hand.  I will try with the swiss next time but I am sure with any kind of cheese you choose they are good.

It's time I left a rating for this.  I have been making these for a few years now and these are the most popular food, no matter what the function!  I always make extra because we eat so amny at home, not to mention eating the mixture before we even put it in.  I read the suggestion to cut the biscuits into thirds and that's what I've been doing all this time.  They turn out fantastic.

oops. I forgot the mayo. And they were FANTASTIC. Probably will skip the calories and not use mayo next time either.  I only have a small mini muffin pan, so I put the left over biscuit halfs on a cookie sheet, pressed filling onto it and they turned out like little breakfast pizzas..very kid friendly!

So easy and yummy! I used the phyllo cups and ended up making 30 total (recipe makes lots of filling!) otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. These look really pretty, too.

Great recipe! I made this for two separate groups – once with phyllo cups and once with biscuits. Folks who had both said they couldn't decide which was better. Definitely divide the biscuits into thirds or fourths – halving makes the dough overpower the filling. As for Mayo v. Cream Cheese, I think you can taste the other flavors better with the mayo. But either way – it’s definitely going in my “standard” recipe box.

These were pretty good.  I did use the phyllo cups as suggested, it was really easy.  I skipped the onions and used scallions instead.  I made one batch with mayonnaise and one batch with cream cheese.  The cream cheese was much better.  I also used cheddar cheese...yummy!
thanks Kelli for sharing!

One word:  WOW!  I made these as an appetizer for Christmas this year and the entire family loved them.  I cut the Grand bisquit dough into quarters, instead of half, and that was the perfect amount of dough.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written - - Absolutely outstanding.  I would highly recommend these tasty "cups".

I have made this several times and plan on making it for an open house Christmas party. If you are looking for a great, easy, nice looking appetizer, this is it! Did I mention it was delicious?  I use the phyllo cups because they look very pretty, and the added little bit of crunch goes very very well with the filling and everyone raves about them! I also make sure not to add too much mayo and I use fresh basil and green onions for flavor. Awesome!!!!

My guests LOVED this appetizer!  I quartered the individual biscuits and patted them into mini muffin tins -- worked beautifully.  Not too doughy.  This one is a definite must try!  All the "chefs" asked for the recipe and those who don't cook asked me to make it again for our next gathering!  Thanks for the recipe.

This has been my favorite appetizer for awhile now.  Every time I share it, I get rave reviews and of course requests for the recipe.  I use Pillsbury crescent dough (makes it more pie-like) and also I cut grape tomatoes in half, which I think makes it easier generally.  I also add freshly ground pepper.  It's so good!!

I made these for a housewarming party, and they were the first to go.  I followed the recipe to a tee, and found that I have a LOT of filling left over, so I may make phyllo appetizers with the remainder.  The Buscuit dough was a little difficult to press into the mini-muffin pan, thereby making the process of filling them rather time-consuming...but the look on everyone's faces and hearing them go on and on made it worth it.

Be sure to use a regular size muffin tin to avoid being too bready.  Press out the dough to fit and then fill. Wildly popular at baby shower. Doubled recipe and made 24 regular muffin tins.

I had high high hopes for these.  I LOVED the filling - until it went into the oven.  Something in the baking process soured the taste for me.  I think that I will try these again with cream cheese.  I really think that will help a lot.  I will try again though because I just love the idea of these and it's worth playing around with I think.

Easy and Yummy! 5+ Stars... I made a few appetizers and this one was the first to go.  I used 10oz package of the pillsbury country biscuits. I have a 24 cup mini cupcake pan and I sliced each biscuit into 8 sections and pressed each piece into the pan and topped with the mixture.  A must try.  You can divide into 4 portions but I seem to think the smaller bite size holds more of the yummy filling.

I thought they were very good. I bought the Grand flaky biscuits and actually quartered them. I doubled the recipe to bring to a X-Mas Party. Everybody liked them, but I guess after reading all the previous reviews, I was hoping for everyone to love them and go crazy for them. I didn't get the reaction I was hoping for. I'll probably make them again- this time for a different crowd.

I agree with everyone, that these were great I used Spin Blen for the mayo because I think it has more flavor, I also used pepper jack cheese and they were excellent. Very EASY too!

I can't say personally that this was a 5 star rating, I am only going by the fact that I doubled the recipe and by the time I got all the other appetizers out these were gone....I didn't even get to try them!!!  Everyone loved them, and when baking them I thought they smelled wonderful.  I'll make sure I grab one before putting them out next time, because there definitely will be a next time.

This recipe surprised the heck out of me! Great combination of flavors and so easy to prepare. Even got my picky son to eat one minus the tomatoes. Will make this again.

This is a great recipe. It's a good idea to spring for the brand name rolls, especially the flakier ones. The cheap ones I bought were a little too doughy but still good. I brought them to a baby shower at work and my Hispanic co-workers all loved them and enjoyed the change from the Mexican dishes we usually eat. Thanks.

My 14 year old son, (who loves to cook), just made these today for lunch, and boy were they good!!  He followed the recipe exactly, except the onions were a bit overpowering (I think because he chopped them fairly large).  We used the smaller canned biscuits because that is what we had on hand.  Really good tomato flavor, too, using fresh tomatoes.  Even the VERY PICKY two younger brothers tried them, and liked them!  This one's a keeper at our house, and I can't wait to wow friends with this one!  Thanks for the recipe!

Don't get me wrong, these were good, but not all that I expected after all the reviews I read. 
They need more tomato, less cheese, and something else to kick it up. Better lukewarm than hot too. 
I'd try them again, but with some doctoring.

This recipe was awesome! I did use less mayo as others had said. I grow my own herbs, so the fresh flavor of the basil and parsley was just heaven. My family gobbled them up. I will be making these next week for an end of year school party! THank you!!

Made these in the mini-muffin size for a women's meeting and they were quickly gobbled up.  I used flaky/layer biscuits which I separated and pressed into the mini-muffin pan.  Very good savory appetizer.

Who thought of this?  I'm glad they did.  Preparing the filling is a little time consuming and I'm sure the calories are really high, but dispite this it is a snack well-worth the effort.  Highly praised by the family.

These were a huge hit at my party.  Especially good hot.  The recipe makes too much filling though.  I used both butter recipe biscuit and regular(pilsbury), and I think the butter was a bit flakier and came out more golden brown.  This was a crowd pleaser.  I wasn't able to make most of the biscuits split into less than thirds, but didn't have a problem with doughiness.  I cooked them a bit longer.

Excellent!  I followed the other reviewers advice and only used enough mayo to moisten the mixture.  Also, I used 10 slices of bacon instead of 8, just because I love it! They turned out so well!! I've already forwarded the recipe on to two of my friends, and I know I'll be making them again!

Thought these were a great little appetizer.  I served them for New Years.  I may have needed to adjust the temp a little, because the bottoms seemed to burn quickly.  I had some of the spread leftover and used it on turkey sandwiches the next day.  A nice change from plain old mayo.

A friend of mine brought a variation of this to our bookclub.  The recipe she had used flaky biscuits, and for the herbs, it called for 1 tsp of dried basil, 3/4 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of dried thyme, and 1/2 tsp of dried oregano.  ALso, 3 oz. of grated mozzarella, instead of swiss.  It was so good!  I made them last night and everyone raved and asked for the recipe!

Loved this recipe.  Have made it several times and everyone loves them.  I take them to work and the people I work with can't wait to grab them.  They reheat well in the microwave. They usually don't last that long, though. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are easy and delicious!  I also cut the dough in thirds as others suggested.  I chopped the bacon in my mini chopper after it was cooked which worked out great.  Next time will add more bacon.  These are best warm right out of the oven.  Will be making these again.

These turned out delicious.  I used regular sized muffin pans and they took a little longer to cook.  I had some leftover filling and made an omelette with it the next morning.  Very tasty!

I just made this yesterday for a football party and they were a huge hit!  The only bummer was my muffin pan couldn't bake all of them at one time so the second batch was burned due to cheering on my football team!

I made this recipe for a New Year's Eve party and it was great!  I had several requests for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe used only 1/2 of the mayonnaise and used buttermilk Grands biscuits cut into fourths.  I will definitely make it again!

This was great. I made some with swiss cheese and some with an italian blend and it was a big hit. I read the reviews and decided to add only one teaspoon of the mayo. Incredible.

This recipe is perfect for bringing to a party.  Prepare them before you go and have the host of the party cook them.  I am asked to bring them for every party I attend.  Huge hit!

Yummy!  These were really good.  I cheated tho, I didn't put these in biscuits.  I just spread the filling on some english muffins and broiled them for a while.  It was delicious!  And SOOO easy!

I love this recipe. It is so simple and they make a wonderful appetizer or side dish.  My children were not to crazy about them but my mother in-law, whom I consider an excellent cook asked me for the recipe.  I will definetly make them again and again.

My husband's friends come over for Nascar and Football - loved them!  I used regular size muffin pan, and used sharp white cheddar instead of swiss.  Bacon was good, but will try slivered pepperoni or perhaps ground hot sausage next time.

These are a hit with everyone!  I read the reviews about the mayo being too strong so I left it out completely.  I chopped up my bacon before browning and cut the biscuts in fourths and rolled them out as other reviewers suggested. Our grocery store didn't have shredded swiss so I used Mozzarella.  We will have these instead of BLT sandwiches from now on.

I tried this out on my picky boyfriend who doesn't like tomatoes, and he loved it! We both did! I used diced canned tomatoes and Hungry Jack flaky biscuits. I also cut down the mayo and also the cheese. These are great!

I've made this 3 times. They're hard to take to a party because they don't last that long. Fresh from the oven is best, but even cooled and served later is delcious. Use real bacon (not bacon bits) for best results, and I agree to divide the dough into smaller chunks.

Fantastic recipe!  The filling is absolutely tasty and delicious.  As for the dough, I found it to be way too thick for the mini muffin pan.  Next time, I will use 1/4 biscuit instead of 1/2.  Thanx!

I have gotten rave reviews from this recipe - and frequently get asked for the recipe.  I had some extra swiss/bacon mixture and decide to toast it with an english muffin - and my son and I *loved* it.  So much, that I frequently make just the mixture for lunches.  Double the mixture recipe for a quick lunch the next day!

These were a terrific HIT at our last dinner party. Think I'll try a larger version for a luncheon or brunch.

Wonderful!  I recommend cutting the biscuits into thirds, which eliminates leftover
filling.   It did take longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but in the end it was 
worth it--they were a real hit!

The flavor of the mayo was too strong.  Next time I'll use lesss mayo and more cheese.  Only one family member would eat these.  Threw half of the out.

Good, substantial snack, or light lunch.
Maybe try larger muffin tins? A little crowded in minis.

I served a double batch of these at a party and they were scarfed up.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  They were a little more difficult to make than I would have liked (I'm not much of a cook) but they tasted so good!

My friend made these for an appetizer party that she hosted.  They were so yummy and good, and were all eaten right away.  I was dissappointed that she hadn't made more.  They were a big hit!

Very tasty.  I also split the rolls into thirds.  I used rolls which are packaged 8 into a 16 oz roll. I will make these again soon.  I did have some filling left over.

This is a "must have" at all parties...with our "Happy Hour" crew. Easy and elegant. A bit messy to work with the biscuit dough...(used the store brand and saved some money) came out great.

This was easy, the only part that was the least bit time consuming was chopping everything up.  I assembled them the night before and then refridgerated in the muffin tins, so the next day I could just throw them in the oven shortly before my guests arrived and then serve them warm.  They were a huge hit, they taste great.  Easy, very pretty and tastey.  I would recommend this recipe.

This recipe was the hit of my party!  Everyone loved the flavor of the bacon, tomato and cheese.  I used a sweet Vidalia onion, otherwise, I would have followed another reviewers suggestions and sauteed the onion first.  They are really easy and the taste is sublime.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were a big hit a my party.  They look like you fussed, but were really quite simple.  I peeled the flaky biscuits into thirds as recommended in the reviews and cheated by using 1/2 jar of bacon bits. I also used the dried minced onion.  They turned out great.

Very good! I had some trouble getting the dough to stick in the mini-muffin tin, and there wasn't a whole lot of room left for teh bacon mixture, but once I got the hang ofit, they turned out looking nice, and all of them tasted fantastic!

I made these for a Women's Club Coffee yesterday and they were gone very qickly. I followed the suggestions and used Hungry Jack bisquits, but divided them in thirds, rolled into balls, then rolled out before placing in tins. I made no adjustments in the filling and ended up with 24. I also substituted 1/2 Tablespoon instant minced onion. I will definitely make these again!

I recently prepared these for a reception at our church.  I had to hide them from a friend of ours so that the guest would have some to sample.  He loved them and so did everyone else who was fortunate enough to get one.  I made a change in the dough, however.  I used the Hungry Jack Buttery flavored biscuits instead of the rolls called for.  This makes 4 cups per biscuit, for a total of 40 per can of Hungry Jack biscuits. I increased the amount of bacon to 12 ounces and the other ingredients accordingly. It's like eating a mini tomato sandwich.  I will use these again at a reception in August. Thanks Kelli for sharing your receipe with me!  Fran

I was asked to contribute an appetizer to a dinner party.  I searched and found this recipe.  It was easy to make, and of all the appetizers at the party, these were the first to go and every lady asked for the recipe.

Delicious, a real hit a party.  I chopped the bacon and also the onion in a mini-chopper because of the mini-muffin tins being so small and a lot of people do not like the texture of onions.  I will definitely recommend this recipe.

This is the greatest appetizer!  Very addictive and everyone loves them.  I find it easier to cut the flaky biscuits into pieces, roll and fill the cups with a wooden handle or tamper.  It makes the recipe a little easier.

I made several changes to this recipe.  After reading the input of other members who have made this, and a first epic failed attempt in working with biscuit dough (I don't cook much with dough), I started over with phyllo dough.  I also reduced the amount of bacon to six slices, as what the recipe called for seemed as though it would be a bit overbearing, and increased the amount of tomato.  Finally, as I am not a huge fan of mayo, I reduced the mayo by about 2/3 and supplemented with a pear champagne dressing.  It turned out well, but I think I will continue to work on this as I felt the bacon still overwhelmed the flavor.  Phyllo was DEFINITELY the way to go.

I thought these were really good, but as written, it's just too much dough for a mini-muffin tin, and too much mayo.  I will cut the dough into thirds next time.   I also followed others' advice and used less mayo (probably between 1/3 and 1/4 cup).  I used my Pampered Chef  mini tart presser/tamper, and it made each biscuit perfectly shaped, and easy to fill!  Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted good and most were eaten at our get-together.  I did not feel the “half” a biscuit worked well in a mini muffin pan, as it fluffed up and so the filling stayed at the top (or was pushed up) as it baked.  I would rather the filling stay throughout.  Maybe a third of a biscuit would be more bite-sized and allow filling to stay evenly throughout each bite.  Plus, biscuit sizes seem so variable depending on if you use store-brand or not, so be aware.  The recipe would have to be gobbled up to get the fifth star, and a few more tweaks would be needed.

These were a hit.. following others' suggestions, I used phyllo shells instead of biscuit dough.  I also used half the amount of mayonnaise.  Because the shells are already cooked, I didn't want them to burn so I baked the filling in a glass casserole dish at the recommended temperature for about 5 minutes.  Then I put them in the shells and baked for another 5 minutes.. Perfect!

This recipe was just ok.  There was too much dough using the refrigerated biscuits (and I even quartered the amount instead of halving it).  Think it would be better if a different type of refrigerated dough was used, such as cresent or pizza dough.

Made almost as directed except use phyllo cups and slightly precooked the onions.  Enough filling for 2 packages, 30 cups.  Brought to a bacon and beer party and they were well received.  Would definitely make them again.

These were a HUGE hit at a party I went to last night!  They went so fast, I had so many people ask me for the recipe, and people even asked if I had more hidden away somewhere.

I did read through quite a few reviews and followed some of the modifications.

This is my recipe mod that made 45 bacon tomato cups:

Two cookie sheets of bacon (16-20 pieces) baked in the oven, blotted to remove fat, cooled and chopped......

8 oz of shredded swiss cheese......

2 chopped tomatoes......

2 tbsp of minced fresh basil......

1 yellow onion chopped and caramelized......

2/3 cup of mayo......

When everything is cooked and chopped, throw it together in a medium bowl.  You can make this part ahead of time and refrigerate if you want.

When it's time to throw everything together, I preheated the oven to 375, put 45 small phyllo  dough cups on a cookie sheet and then scooped the filling into each shell (a heaping amount).

Bake for 12-15 min.

These are the best savory, flaky, cheesy bacon-y appetizer I've made!  Like I said before:  they were such a hit!

I followed the recipe with a couple of changes and in fact doubled it.  I used red onions and miracle whip in place of mayo. There was not a crumb left.  One of the quickest and easiest "appie" recipes I have ever made. It will be my go to appetiser

This was a huge hit at my New Years Eve party. I don't have any mini-muffin pans so I made it in regular pans. It was fine. I ended up getting 14 regular sized cups. 
  As many folks here have done I cut back on the mayo. Other than that, I made no other changes. I will definitely make this one again.

Crowd pleaser, delicious, AND easy! Made this with what I had left in the kitchen on the Friday before my bi-weekly weekend grocery shopping. Added notes: I cooked down the tomato and onion slightly before adding to mixture and baking in oven, and I used crestant rolls instead of biscuit rolls (they were deemed a little too buttery by some), and I also used salt, pepper, oregano, and fresh basil. I also used parmesan cheese generously sprinkled on top instead of Swiss. Overall delicious, would definitely make again!

I  too thought the biscuits were a little heavy. Might try croissant dough next time. All in all a very tasty appetizer. Definitely make the filling the night before to allow the flavors to meld.

Be sure and mince the onions or they are undercooked. The guest loved them.  They looked sloppy as they were top heavy. Next time I'll use a regular size muffin pan. I used fresh basil too and that was great.

I used Philsbury JUNIOR (size) flaky biscuit dough - these are just a smaller version of the Grands flaky biscuits. It's easy to pull these into two or even three layers which fit perfectly into the bottom of a regular muffin tin.

My family, neighbors and I love these! Better than I thought. I used Smithfields thick cut bacon, avocado mayo, Pillsbury's buttermilk biscuits, fresh tomato and onion. I cut this recipe in half. So easy and quick. They're not dry at all but I think even more tomato would be good!! Just a preference. Also thought the Swiss cheese would be overpowering in flavor but it really was not. Try them!

Made it with ham instead of bacon, sautéed together with chopped garlic and the onion. Used only a bit of just mayo and added cream cheese. Used small phyllo dough  cups instead. It was a yummy appetizer. Good as a base recipe.

These were a hit and I made them in regular muffin pans. Maybe because I got the grand biscuit 16 oz can so the biscuits are large and when sliced horizontally, they more easily fit into the regular muffin pans. I was looking for more of a breakfast experience anyway and it made 16 full size muffins with generous fillings. As a previous reviewer states, I feel like these biscuits are very sweet and might add sharp cheddar next time rather than shredded swiss to counter the sweetness of the biscuits. Could also sub crumbled sausage rather than bacon. I did cheat and use Hormel real bacon bits and this worked great making prep time pretty quick since we were on vacation and wanted easy.

I followed it as written, except I did cut back on the mayo. However, I just didn't like the canned biscuit taste for the crust. Maybe I was expecting something more akin to quiche. Overall, the filling was fine, but the crust wasn't great. I had a lot left over. Maybe if I make this again, I might try pie crust, or filo as another reviewer suggested.

Didn't exactly follow this recipe to a "T" I did use bacon, I sauteed sweet onions in butter salt and pepper. I did use shredded swiss and mayo. But Instead of basil I used green onion ! And I didn't have a mini muffin pan just a regular cupcake pan. Anyways I made three batches of these for thankgiving dinner as one of many many appetizers that were brought to dinner. These things disappeared before anything else.  I think everyone will be disappointed if I don't make these again for xmas.

I love it!  My husband said it was good in a weird way.  My 65 year old dad, a traditional, always had a home cooked meal kind of man, loved these.  Instead of using mayonnaise, I used cream cheese (with chives) to keep the mixture together and instead of swiss, used cheddar because that is all I had.  It gave it more flavor and was just GREAT.  I had to cook them longer than 12 minutes- more like 15 minutes since the center of the cup is filled with wet stuff.  I even had some leftovers and they tasted great reheated!

I made these for a get together with my friends, and everyone loved them. 
I wasn't sure if I would have enough filling, so I increased the filling 50%, but doubled the amount of Swiss cheese . I also added fresh ground sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and some grated parmesan cheese. 
I used regular size muffin pans. I used one can of biscuits, pulled each biscuits in half, then stretch the biscuit to is came up about 3/4" on the sides, then filled.
I backed at 375 degrees for 14 minutes, so the bottom of the biscuit was golden brown. 
Next time I make this I'll add a clove of garlic to the filling and some romana choose for a little more flavor.

My husband came home with the large biscuits, so they were too big for the mini muffin cups.  The onion needs to be cooked first.  And maybe a different kind of cheese...

This is my favorite appetizer! Like other reviews I use just enough mayo to hold it all together. I also add some garlic powder & I use half Swiss half cheddar cheese. I tried the phyllo dough & didn't like it as well as the biscuit dough. I get the flaky biscuits & pull them apart to only use half a biscuit.

I didn't even get a chance to taste these! I made these for the adults at my daughter's birthday and everyone ate them up. I changed the recipe, but didn't know how to submit the change. I used only cream cheese, a drained can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles, precooked bacon, the Junior Grands! dough, and shredded mozzarella cheese with jalapeno for the topping. Will be making again at the request a friend for her baby shower.

I made a double batch of these for a party yesterday and they were a HUGE hit.  We had to travel to the party, so they needed warming prior to serving.  People were plucking them off the platter before I could even get them heated!!  They loved them cold and warm.  I never even got to try one, they were such a hit!!  I also reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup.  My husband had used our last fresh tomato (without me knowing), so I used canned whole tomatoes and diced them.  Worked fine.

really good, really easy to make.  I would put less mayo, add chopped/sliced mushrooms next time.  You can also top it to make a mini pot pie in a sense OR double layer it! will make again!

I followed the advise of other reviews and sautéed the onions in the bacon grease and only added enough mayo to moisten everything.  I didn't have swiss cheese, so I substituted mozzarella. Will make again!

I am giving this three stars because we really liked the filling for it but something about it being in a biscuit made us not like it. I think I am going to try it on something else like a leaf of lettuce or crackers.

I LOVED this recipe.  I have made them several times and even reheated in micro they were good.  I wanted to make this for my "buncettes" but we were spending the day at the pool and playing bunco afterwards.  So I made the stuffing first and then filled my muffin tin with the biscuits.  I covered my tin with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for several hours.  Pulled it out and filled the buscuits and threw them in the oven.  They came out just as they would if I would have made them all at once.  Nice to know that I can do most of the work ahead of time.  Thanks for a great appitizer!

Fantastic!  I have made these a few times now to serve as appetizers at various events.  Tonight, I am making them by request.  Usually, when I am asked to bring an item, I am given total freedom as to what to bring ... but these were specifically requested by three different individuals.  The only change I make is to divide the separated biscuits into sixths instead of just dividing them in half.  Even when I double the recipe, there are never any leftovers.  Always a big hit!

I made these for a weekly Bible study and they were a hit; I had no leftovers.  I tried these with the mini phyllo cups (awesome!) and the biscuits cut in half, rolled, flattened, and "cupped".  I thought they tasted better and looked more elegant in the phyllo.  My picky daughter liked both ways.  After reading other reviews, I used a fresh 6 oz block of Swiss, 2 green onions instead of yellow, turkey bacon (I fried it first, then crumbled), and a small amount of mayo to just moisten, with about a T. of cream cheese (that was all I had).  Next time I'll try with a mayo/sour cream mix and some with Cheddar, too. I have already been asked to make these again for church, not to mention for an upcoming Memorial Day family gathering.  Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe is great for breakfast, a snack, or a brunch appetizer. I did a couple things different; instead of using mayonnaise I used 4 eggs, whisked with 2 tablespoons of milk, because I wanted to add more protein. I also made them in regular sized muffin tins so I cut the biscuits in half, flattened them out, and pushed them up the sides of the muffin cup. With the egg, I cooked them for 13-16 minutes. I will make these again!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly (except used fresh chopped basil) and brought 3 dozen to Sunday Easter brunch.   They were gone in minutes!  I will double the recipe next time!   So easy and delish!  I used "grands" biscuits and cut each biscuit into 6ths to put in the mini muffin pan.

This was a great recipe!  When putting the biscuits in the pan I made a bit of a well and then put the topping in there and pushed it in as much as possible.  I used Asiago cheese & the already crumbled bacon to skip a step (1 tbsp = 1 strip).  Yummy!  I will make these again for sure.  I might try and just mix the topping witht the biscuit & see how that works.  Fun.

Simple and Easy. I made some as directed but had extra dough. I topped several with the extra dough and they made the cutest cupcake looking appetizers. (and easier to handle) I made some with diced ham too. Very good. Will use again and again!

Really yummy!  I used homemade biscuit dough and lined the muffin cups with dough, then filled with the mayo mixture.  I used turkey bacon and light mayo, skipped the onion (hubby doesn't like), and I just added enough mayo to really hold the ingredients together.  I also didn't have swiss cheese so I used a cheddar blend and it was fantastic!  Thanks for a great idea!

I have made these on several occasions and they are always a huge hit! If no one else ever ate them, I would certainly stuff myself full of them! But that is never a problem!

I was hoping to duplicate a recipe I had tried at a party. Very dissappointed. The flavor and texture were disappointing.

So delicious and super easy! Took to every holiday party last year and were a huge hit.  I used only enough mayo to moisten mixture and used 1/3 of a biscuit rather than half.  Also, I've added a variety of cheese if I didn't have swiss and they've always turned out great.

This was tasty but a bit time consuming to dice up all the veggies. I used 3 servings of "Cheddar Buttermilk Biscuits" to equal about 12 oz of dough. I used a mini-muffin pan so I made 24 little cups. The only modification I did was to use only 1/4 cup of mayo. Next time, I would like to decrease the cooking time if I use the mini-muffin trays. If not, I would like to see how these work for a regular muffin tray. Served with "Chicken Puffs" and mixed veggies.

I've got to say, I didn't love these.  I did omit the onion because I don't like it and perhaps that had something to do with it, but I just really didn't care for them.  In fact I took them to a cookout that was all finger foods and my dishes are typically the ones gobbled up the quickest, but there were a number left over tonight.  They were good, but nothing great.

There aren't enough stars to rate these little treasures; they're utterly divine.  I used fresh basil, but stuck strictly to the recipe otherwise.  My family can't get enough of 'em!  My brother, who considers himself Craig Claiborne, Julia Child and Escoffier only better, initially turned his nose up at these ... until he tasted one.  He's much too proud to ask for the recipe, but he did ask to take some home.  Thanks for such a wonderful offering.

I've taken these to several different gatherings, and every time, someone asks me for the recipe.  I did take the advice of others and cut way down on the mayo.  I just used enough to get everything moist.  I've also used the pre-cooked bacon in a pinch, and have experimented with a variety of different cheeses to change it up every now and then!

This is a great recipe! I've made them for company in my home... I've also taken them to work. I'm not real big on Mayo, so used a smaller amount. The bacon is what definitely makes this recipe tasty.

I used what I had in the fridge. Phyllo cups, pre-made shredded bacon (the kind for salad), fresh shredded parm cheese, red onion, dried basil, nonfat Miracle Whip.  Cut way back on the amt of mayo.  The phyllo cups made this outstanding.  The only complaint was I didn't make enough.  Next time I make this recipe, I'll try blue cheese or smoked havarti.

Great recipe. Very tasty. I subbed cheddar cheese because I don't like Swiss and also did not use 1/2 of a biscuit, that was way too much for a mini muffin cup; I cut the biscuit into quarters and used that instead. Turned out great.

Delicious! I have made these twice now--once with the biscuits and once with the phyllo cups. We much prefer the biscuits! We used a regular muffin pan since we don't have a mini one. Dividing the biscuits in half works like a charm. We used just a dab of sour cream (just enough to moisten) in place of the mayo. Fantastic! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are great, I used jumbo bisciuts and quartered them, but they were still too big and filling oozed all over the pan.  Next time I will probably try to divide the biscuts into 1/6.  Hopfully they will turn out a little neater.

Made these for a holiday party and actually forgot to add the cheese! No harm done, I guess I just cut the fat a little! I used green onion instead of regular and turkey bacon. I just cut up the bacon into small pieces prior to cooking so it would still get crispy. Everyone loved them! I doubled the recipe but left the mayo the same. Turned out great. Used a mini tart pan and a regular muffin pan. I think the small ones were cuter.

I made this for a fantasy football party this year, and it was a huge hit!  I had several people that told me they generally don't like onions, but they loved these... I have been asked to make them several times since.  One change that I made was with the amount of mayo.  I didn't measure exactly, but I put in just enough to make it moist.  The recipe seems to call for too much as is.  Very good recipe, and I would recommend it to cooks at any level.

This is a great recipe... I used the flakey biscuits instead of buttermilk and I halved them so it wasn't so doughy... I also used a 1/2 cup of ranch dressing instead of the mayo and these turned out very yummy.

I used this as a cold appetizer. I baked the biscuits on the bottom of the muffin tin and filled the cooled biscuit cups with the filling. I thought when I baked them with the filling they became to soft to quickly. Really good.

I had no idea what I was doing with the dough, but the turn out was wonderful! The flavors were great too. I used sharp cheese and crescent biscuit dough. Thank you!

Made these for my husbands birthday party and they (among lots of finger foods) were the first to go and got so many comments! Everyone loved them. I made one week in advance, didn't _completely_ bake them, froze, and took them out of the freezer the day of the party, popped in the oven, reheated, and they were great.

Great recipe and so easy to make. I added a bit too much bacon as I used the crumbles you can buy in a bag. I also used cheddar cheese and feta. I think next time I would just use Feta. Yum Yum!!

I MADE THESE FOR MY DAUGHTERS 2ND BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS SUMMER.  I HAD THE WHOLE FAMILY OVER FOR A BBQ.  EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THEM.  I MADE SEVERAL OTHER APPS. ALSO BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY EMPTY DISH.  THEY WERE A BIG HIT.  EVERYONE ASKED ME FOR THE RECIPE BUT I WAS HESITANT BECAUSE THIS WILL BE MY NEW SIGNITURE DISH TO BRING TO FAMILY PARTYS! THEY HAVE TO FIND THERE OWN!  ONLY KIDDING!  THEY WERE GREAT AND FAIRLY EASY TO MAKE.  I MADE THE BACON A FEW DAYS AHEAD SO IT WAS READY WHEN I WANTED TO MAKE THEM, THE REST WAS SIMPLE AND IT INCLUDES INGREDIENTS YOU HAVE ON HAND.

I was not crazy about these.  I did use fillo cups instead of the biscuit dough but those tasted fine.  I think it was the basil in the mix I did not like.  It had a very strong taste and I couldn't even tell there was bacon in it but I used the amount indicated in the recipe.  Don't think I will make these again.

I made these with Grands biscuits, I halved them but still thought they turned out big for an appetizer. Next time I will use smaller biscuits and a mini muffin pan. They were absolutely delicious!!

These tasted so good-and I'm not a huge fan of swiss cheese! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I made regular size and they were very tasty.

I've made this recipe twice.  I've used the cresent rolls and the biscuits...most people liked the taste of the cresent rolls...less sweet.  I used a pound of bacon and only enough mayo to moisten the mixture...oh, and I removed the seeds from the tomato.  My guests are still raving about it.

Served this for a spur of the moment cocktail party. Eleven miles from the nearest market, so, used baguetts and parmesan. It was a big hit.

This was a great recipe, but I did reduce the mayonnaise in half. I think using the full amount would have made them a little too greasy. They were very tasty. I will make these again.

GREAT recipe.  However, I used the flaky buttermilk biscuits and Hormel REAL Bacon Pieces instead of frying the bacon.  Then a bit of salt/pepper on top as they came out of the oven.  Wonderful remarks from my guests.

Yummy!  These are requested for every shower I throw, and they are always the first thing gone.  Only change I made was to use puff pastry cut into squares instead of the biscuits.

I used several of the reviewer's suggestions...phyllo cups, substituted 1/2 the mayonaisse with cream cheese and also added some garlic granules.  Doubled the recipe.  It turned out great and everyone seemed to love them.  They were gone in 5 minutes!

I have made this several times for parties and people loved it. I accidentally picked up the honey butter biscuits and people loved the sweet and savory of the recipe. If you don't have cups you can make thise into rolls. I take the biscuits and put the filling in the middle then make them into rolls.

I took these to a Super Bowl party and they were gone in minutes!  I used cheddar cheese and half the mayo, and two cans of 12-oz (10-count) biscuit dough, cut each biscuit in half, rolled it into a ball, and then flattened it and spread it in a cup, and I had plenty of filling for all 40 cups it made.  Very tasty!

Loved these.  I used 1/2 ranch dressing and 1/2 mayo as reviewers suggested.  They were gone in minutes.  Very addicting.

This recipe is simple and yummy.  I've served them as appetizers and made larger versions for dinner too.  It's a keeper.

I would've given this 4 stars but since my husband loved these, I gave it a 5 (he is hard to please).  I made them in a large muffin pan (to make the portions bigger) and we had them for dinner with a salad.  I thought it was good, but would add less mayo and possibly some blue cheese dressing next time.  Worth making again and experimenting.

These were great!  Even my husband, who doesn't like to experiment, loved them.  I didnt modify the recipe except for adding a little green onion for color.

These were very good!  Instead of using a 16 oz can of biscuits, I used a 7.5 oz and rolled them with a rolling pin before I put them into the muffin cups.  I think this will solve a lot of the problems that people are having with them cooking unevenly.  Also, just cook them at the temp and time the biscuits indicate.  Enjoy!

These are amazing!  I have had people say they are the best breakfast food they've ever eatten.  So many people have asked for the recipe.
I made the filling the night before and they were great.  I tripled the recipe but only doubled the mayo and they were perfect.  I think more mayo would have been too oily.  You have to try these!

These were phenomenal -- I'm going to make them for every party from now on!  I only used enough mayo to moisten the mixture, and I think that was a good call.  Also, I couldn't find a 16oz can of biscuit dough, but 12oz of dough (ten biscuits, 20 cups) worked just fine.

I made these for a Christmas gathering and they disappeared like magic.  My husband really enjoyed them and sometimes he can be hard to please.  I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe.  I split the biscuits in 1/3 or 1/4 depending on how easy it was to separate them.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 ranch dressing as suggested by other reviews.  I used monterey jack, and cheddar cheeses because that was all I had on hand and I found that the basil flavor was a little too much for my liking so I used 1/2 the suggested amount and 1/2 oregano.  Much better!

Loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.  Thanks for the reviews.
I buttered the mini muffin tins, cut each Grands Flaky biscuit into sixths, used green onions and substituted provolone cheese.  Fantastic.

These are SO good!  I followed other reviewers and cut back on the mayo.  I'm not sure how much I used since I spooned some in, mixed, spooned a bit more, mixed, etc. etc.  I stopped when the consistency seemed right - probably at around 1/4 cup or so.  I was also able to make 48 absolutely delicious cups in my mini muffin pan.  I had to cook them around 13 to 14 minutes and found that they don't taste too bad when slightly overcooked.  They have a firmer texture.  These sit out very well at room temperature - next time I will have them cooked prior to guests arriving rather than coming fresh from the oven.  VERY GOOD RECIPE and I will definitely make this again!

This really sounded good but didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped.  The biscuits were too big....definitely worked out better when I quartered the biscuits as another reviewer mentioned and rolled them into balls, flattened and shaped them into the mini muffin pan.  Also, it just tasted like mayonnaise....and I really like mayo...but that was almost all you could taste.

I made this tonight with fresh tomato, onion, green onion, and bacon pieces as well as cheddar cheese. I used 1/2 cup of sour cream along with a full envelope of ranch dressing mix and added about 1 tbsp or so of mayonnaise. These came out GREAT. The only thing I did not like was the biscuit on bottom - it was flavorless and seemed kind of bland. The topping, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Yum!!!

I have made these on several occassions.  They are the first thing to go when put out with other foods. I have made them the day before, refridge, then reheat on cookie sheet and they are still wonderful.  The only changes I made is to use cheddar cheese because I do not like swiss.  I do have a tendancy to use a bit more bacon and I use the good name brand biscuts and cut each one into thirds.  Everyone loves them!

I thought these sounded so good by the reviews but I just didn't think they were that great.  Seems like they were so bready, maybe I didn't add enough of the mix to the rolls.  Might try again.

I would have given this a 6 star if they had it.
This is great.  The only things I changed was to heed the advice of others and use Ranch dressing instead of the mayo but only enough to hold the mixture together.  I also cut the biscuits into thirds instead of fourths.  I made a double batch and the cups turned out perfect the first time. They vanished within 15 minutes of the start of the party.  Everyone raved about them and many asked for the recipe.

Made these for a party of 40 people and they were one of the hits! I actually separated the biscuits into thirds- not so much dough that way.

I LOVED these! I didn't have and basil, but they were still great.  Even my husband, who is not big on tomatoes, really liked these:-)

Great recipe!  I only changed two things.  I cut the biscuits into fours instead of halves and I used a little less mayo than what was called for.  Turned out great and was a big hit!

This recipe was just ok for our family. I made a few as the recipe stated and it was to much biscuit, then cut it down to 1/3 biscuit and that only made it even soggier. My husband, kids, and I each ate one an that was enough. A few went to the neighbor boy who eats anything and the rest went to the trash. Sorry but this is the last time we will ever make these.

I made this for breakfast and they were delicious. I didn't have any swiss cheese so I used colby-jack. I also used pilsbury grand flaky biscuits cut into four.

The only hard part was trying to get them out of the muffin tin.

This was the hit of the baby shower.  Never received more compliments on an appetizer.  I would use about 1/2 the mayo called for, but that's a personal preference. The recipe has inspired all sorts of filling ideas (chicken & brocolli, pizza, etc)

I served these for a family gathering and they were slow to go.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I still think they have potential with some changes.  The onion was overpowering (and we like onion) so I'd put less onion.  I'd probably try them with cheddar instead of swiss.  I would suggest less dough (I should have read more of the reviews) and more filling in each cup.  These are very easy.  I made the filling a day ahead.  Worth another try.

These were awesome even though they failed the first time I made them - way to much dough (I used halves like the recipe said) - next time I will try thirds.  Other than that - this is a keeper!

These are fantastic, I have made them for several functions and always get asked for the recipe.  I always seem to have more filling than I need, will have to try cutting them in thirds as suggested rather than halves.

I was craving something with tomato, when I ran across this recipe.  I knew I would love it, but didn't think my boyfriend would be big on it.  Man was I wrong!!  HE LOVED THEM!!!  Between my roommate, boyfriend and I, we ate them all in less than 2 days!!!!  My boyfriend even told me that I should make them for his mother sometime!!  THANKS!!

I didn't care for these.  They were easy though, and I might make again in a pinch. Maybe I'll try again with phyllo cups, definitely not biscuits.  Somehow flavor of the topping didn't mesh well at all with the biscuits.  Edible, but just that for me.

I was going to make these for a baby shower, but ran out of time.  I'm glad I didn't, I don't think they would have gone over too well.  I made them last night for my family, we really did not like them at all and we are BLT lovers.  I won't make these again.

These are pretty good if eaten immediately, but super greasy when they start to cool.  If I make these again, I'll try the suggested real bacon bits and will also use the biscuits instead of the shells.

these were absolutely delicious!  I used real "bacon bits" from a pouch that I found next to the dried up bottled "bac-o's"  It didn't seem to make a difference in the final product. Friends were asking for the recipe, so yes, it was a hit!

These were awesome.  My entire family loved them.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave instead of a pan to get the bacon extra crispy, then bloted on a paper towel to remove grease. I also seeded the tomoto before I chopped. I had filling left over, so my family got some chips and ate the rest of the filling as a dip.  Very Yummy, and easy.  Will make again.

Everyone raved about this yummy treat!  Quick and easy to make too.  My tips are to FINELY chop the tomato and onion since they are on top of such little muffins.  We tried them both hot out of the oven and at room temp- both are tasty, but warm is better than room temp.  Next time I will try fresh basil for an added umph.  Enjoy it!

This recipe was super tasty and oh so easy!!
What a hit, I made this for a party and my guests were asking for more.  Tastes like it would take some time to prepare, but is one of the quickest  and best tasting apps I have ever made.

I made this for a recent party I had.  Although it was a bit time consuming to make, my guests loved it.  There wasn't a single one left and they were asking for seconds.  I am usually very fussy but also enjoyed this very much (though not something I would eat on a regular basis).  I did make the mistake of using foil regular size muffin tins which proved to be a bit tricky but I'm ready this time.  All in all, a fantastic appetizer

The filling was delicious but the cup was WAY too doughy. I added more bacon and will use the phyllo cups next time. Can't wait to try it like that!

I made these for a Super Bowl party and did they ever go over big.  They were gone in no time.  I didn't have the mini muffin pans, so I used the regular size muffin pans.  I cut the biscuits in half and spread them out to cover the bottom of pan.  Then just cover the biscuit with filling and bake.  I made sure to spray the pan down good with spray margarine to ensure they came out easy.  Excellent recipe.  Will use over and over again.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but we were going to a New Years party and the hostess called last minute asking us to bring an appetizer, so I gave it a try. They were the first thing to go and several people asked for the recipe! I reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup and divided Grands biscuits into thirds (half would have been way too doughy). I also used the Oscar Meyer ready-to-eat precooked bacon and they turned out perfect. Everyone kept commenting on the "crust", so I will stick with the buttermilk biscuits (even though it’s pretty time consuming) rather that the phyllo cups that have been suggested by other users. Great recipe!!

I served these at a New Year's Eve party and they were a big success.  I also used less mayo than stated, and they were still wonderful!

I made these to a "T" last night and they were wonderful!!! They were so easy to make and the taste is incredible!  I chopped up the bacon before I fried it, made it easier.  I also used two roma tomatoes,YUM! I pre-made the filling and let it marinate until it was time to pop them in the oven.So easy, these muffins are not only delicious but beautiful.  These were a huge hit at my party last night!!! Thank you!

These were great! I did change a few things. I never buy buscuit dough, I always make my own. So that's what I did here. It allowed me to make the dough as thick or as thin as I wanted. I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss and reduced the amount of mayo alot. I used roma tomatos. Cutting up the bacon before frying was great advice from another member.  I also made a pizza version using pepporoni, green pepper, mushrooms, cheese, tomato sause, and basil.  These were great too! This recipe has me thinking of so many possible fillings to try. Thanks for the ideas!

Not only are the phyllo cups so much easier to use, but they have a nicer texture and look nicer as well.  I found the fresh tomato did not give a lot of flavor and substituted chopped sun-dried tomato the next time I made them.  Green onion adds a nice color contrast.

These were good. I used lowfat biscuits, lowfat mayo, and turkey bacon. Made these for a get together, they were not as well received as the spinach dip but they got eaten anyway. My sister made them for a card night and said they were the first thing to go, though one of the easiest to make. Just tore off pieces of the dough and kindof stuffed it down into the mini muffin tin. If you stuff them just over half-full (depending on what kind of dough you use, probably), they will rise about the muffin cup and encircle the dough, making them look quite nice and shapely once taken out of the pan. Recommended.

Very tasty!  I used cheddar as I did not have swiss on hand.  I also "biggie-sized" them in that I put a whole biscuit in a regular muffin tin - it made 10 that way.  I would make them small as appetizers, but wanted to serve them for dinner, so I made them larger.  I served them along with the Roquefort Pear Salad found on this site & guacamole & chips.  The whole meal was good and would make a for a refreshing lunch menu when having your girlfriends over!

This recipe looked SO good and I ended up a bit disappointed.  More bacon would be good (to CMolson, no, you can never have too much bacon).  They were so bready that I felt I missed everything else.  I like one person's idea of using circles of pie crust.  I also turned out not liking the tomato, even though I love BLTs.  I didn't score it lower cause I happen to like biscuits, so it's not like it was a bad experience.  And they were cute.

Well, my husband said this was ok, but my superbowl guests said "amazing!"  So it gets five stars.  I made some the first day for my husband and baked the rest of the mixture (the next day) for Sunday's party.  Maybe it tasted better after letting the flavors mix.  Really, I couldn't tell the difference, both days tasted good to me.

Filling is very tasty, but gets slightly overpowered by the biscuit cup (and I love Pillsbury biscuits!). Will probably make again, but would like to try the phyllo cup that has been mentioned for a thinner, crispier shell. Might increase bacon to 10 strips, because can you ever really have too much bacon?

These are REALLY good!!!!  I tried the regular muffin pan first.  Good but sometimes messy after the first bite.  I'll use the mini muffin pan next time.  I used Buttermilk Grands but will use regular sized bisquits for the mini pan.  Thanks for a excellent recipe.

Yum!  I made these for a movie night and they were quickly snarfed up.  I even gave away the recipe that I had printed out.  Had some leftover filling (I had the smaller size biscuit dough) but I subsituted crescent rolls that I cut up into smaller pieces.  Might be a good suggestion for people not equipped with mini muffin tins.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

With a few extra biscuits I was able to stretch the filling to 30 mini cups.  I took them to a Christmas Eve party and everyone commented on how delicious they were.  These cups make a nice presentation and give the impression you spent hours in the kitchen!  Next time I will try using a little less basil, I think it overpowered the other flavors.

Had it for a neighborhood gathering and all LOVED them!  Absolutely agree to use 1/3 of each biscuit.  Will make again and again......

I added chopped green onion and substituted parmesan cheese (freshly grated) for the Swiss that we didn't have.  Everyone loved these and they are a request at the house now!

I served this for a snack on Christmas morning and they went fast!  I saved some for guests that arrived later to try b/c of the reviews said they went quick and they did.  I used sauteed onions and the Hungry Jack flaky biscuits.  I think that I will try it as a filling for croissants next.

I made this recipe for a family holiday gathering and they were a success.  By adding a little more basil than the recipe called for the taste became more like pizza than BLT.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you.

This was a *big* hit at my party. They taste good after they've cooled off too. 
I can't speak to whether kids like them or not but I bet they would! I used 
pre-cooked bacon and just heated it up in the microwave, which made the 
recipe really quick and easy.

These are GREAT!  They're easy enough to whip up for a potluck, and everyone always wants the recipe.  They're yummy both warm and cold, so they're a great potluck food.  The combination of cheese, bacon, onion, tomato, and flaky biscuit is really delicious!

These are delish!  I'm glad I practiced before my party, though, because I'm going to make a few changes.  Cut the biscuits in thirds, not halves.  Try to make a deep well so more filling will fit in.  And I think I will partially saute the onion with the bacon to mellow it a little.  I also used 1 T. pesto in place of the dried basil.

I just tried this recipe to be used as a dinner party appetizer.  I bought the Pilsbury Buttermilk Biscuts, in the four pack.  They seemed a little small for my mini-muffin tins, so I used a whole biscut. These are SO easy, and tasty my finicky six year old ate them!  (My friend's children wouldn't try them though!) :)  Thanks!

These are yummy.  And you can reheat them too.  My guests were anxious to get ahold of this recipe.
