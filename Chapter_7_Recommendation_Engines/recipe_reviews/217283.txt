I served this salsa at three different events, and it was a huge hit at each one.  Easy, healthy and delicious--the perfect summer combination.

I followed the recipe exactly and then served it with the doubled recipe of Beef Empanadas (also on this site).   This recipe was large enough to accompany 20 empanadas generously.  It made a nice size bowl.  I let it marinade in the fridge for about an hour before serving and it was great.  Not spicy at all, but fantastic for summer.

Big hit. Had to leave the party without my bowl for fear of having my fingers bitten off. I followed the recipe, but added a diced avocado. I think i will use more jalapeno next time, too. It's a keepa.

Absolutely yummy!!!!!!! I loved it. I did however add 1tbs of vinegar, a little more cilantro and black eye peas since i had them, some pineapple and red pepper. I also used red onion. It was very good and easy for my first salsa. Thank you for a great base.

Nice salsa, and it is QUICK to put together.  Served with Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos which really give you a punch of heat and are a good complement to the sweet mango.  If not using these chips, I'd probably add a bit more jalapeno, and I could see using fresh peaches in place of the mangoes for a little different taste.

This is so quick and easy! I use more tomatoes and more peppers, but you can easily adjust this recipe to your own tastes.

I don't even like mangoes, and my husband and I were fighting over this salsa.  Delicious, and a wonderful way to use ingredients from the farmer's market!

This recipe was amazing; it sure didn't last long, even with all the other food I made. I only used one mango though (it was large), and I feel that was enough. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

First time ever making a Mango Salsa and I have to say this was so easy and so good!  I was a little hesitant to use it with our fish tacos tonight, not knowing how the mango would taste with the fried fish, but it was delish. I only used half the juice of my lime, only because it was a large one.  I also didn't use a fresh jalapeno since I already had some jarred.  I chopped up what looked like a small to med size jalapeno and also added a small amount of the juice.  It gave just the right amount of heat for us, but only after sitting a bit for the flavors to come together.  Will make again.  Oh my, just had some more of this that I made yesterday after sitting overnight, Amazing!!

This is more a Pico De Gallo than a Salsa. 
However, it is a good basic combination.
A salsa is more blended than a pico de gallo; with the latter more of a chopped mixture.

Left out the tomato, used red onion, no jalapeno so used a few shakes of hot sauce.  So quick and easy to prepare (I used already peeled and sliced mango from the store.) . So good, everyone liked it, even the kids.

I loved this recipe but I  added a few ingredients that I like in a salsa. I added diced avocado, chopped green onions,  red bell peppers,  and I omitted the tomatoes.  The key to a great salsa is extra lime juice..

Made this for a big family dinner.   I made the salsa ahead in the morning  and refrigerated it until dinner.   I served it as an accompaniment to  broiled Rock Cod fillets.

The salsa added freshness and flavour to the fish.  Everybody enjoyed it, and the leftovers were snagged by a DIL to take home to serve over chicken breast, which she reported as a win.   Do note, if you want spicy, add more jalapeno.  Just one jalapeno gives it some picante, but no fire.  Next time I will split the salsa in half, and add more jalapeno to one dish, and leave the other as the recipe stated, making everybody really happy.

I don't eat spicy food.  But even without the jalapeno pepper this was a keeper.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator (cover with plastic wrap) the better it gets.  I served it with tortilla chips and we liked it a lot.

Always a favorite. I do like to add a touch of balsamic vinegar for a bolder flavor. Must have!
