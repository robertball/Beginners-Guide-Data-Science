This is an great easy recipe.  I mix my butter and fresh herbs than place in a piece of plastic wrap, mold into a log and place in the freezer for a few hours.  Once frozen, I then cut the butter mixture into discs and place the frozen butter/herb discs between the turkey skin and the meat.  As the turkey cooks, the butter and herbs melt into the meat and it is fabulous!

Really really good!  We covered it with foil, and turned down the temp for the past hour and a half.  Other than that it was fabulous and a big hit!!!

Everyone agrees that this was the best turkey they've ever had! Was given a 28 lb'er and although a little scary - using this recipe - essentially unchanged except for oven @ 350 F. - brought out a Turkey that was moist, flavorful and ever so good.

My family raved and my husband said I redeemed my turkey cooking ability since my thanksgiving turkey was a flop! I only used a 7 lb breast with this recipe, but it was great! The gravy was delicious as well!

This worked just as I had hoped and with the dressing added inside there was just that extra special sweetness that shouldn't be missed!

it didn't turn out moist. I think that I started basting it early enough. So I will try again.

Followed recipe exactly as stated and the turkey juices and syrup starting burning within the first 10 minutes. I turned the oven down to 400 and it still kept burning the bottom of the pan enough so that the smoke alarm went off. I turned it down again to 375 but I had to add water to the bottom of the pan. Turkey ended up very dry. I will not make this again. I will stick with my traditional way of roasting the turkey from now on.

I've been banned from the kitchen for many years. My husband won't even let me near the pots and pans for dinners. He let down his guard and allowed me make another attempt at cooking. Well, I found this recipe and gave it a shot. I am so glad I did!!! This was amazing. (I didn't use vermouth and I don't know what it is.)

Originally I was just going to put the turkey in an oven bag with some seasonings. I still used the oven bag for the first 2 hours, which kept the juices contained and the meat super moist. The last hour I removed the bag so the turkey would get a nice crisp to the skin. You could taste the different flavors - the skin had a tasty flavor, the meat had a seasoned flavor. I took the drippings and thickened it up with some cornstarch, which was a great gravy! 

I now have the new title of Turkey Chef for the remainder of my life. This will be the recipe that I will be using.

I made a 20 pound turkey for 8 adults and 3 kids. Before I was able to fix my plate over 3/4 of the breast meat was gone. Two of the kids told me it was the best turkey ever and I watched more than one adult hover over the platter and gobble it up. I may be a bit impartial since I prepared it, but it was the best turkey I have tasted.

Excellent turkey--I agree, don't cook it on 450 the whole time.  I only cooked it at that temp for 1 hour and it was already turning too dark on the top. I say just cook it at 350.  Anyway, it was very flavorful and my boyfriend made turkey carcass soup the next day (an allrecipes.com recipe) and it was delicious because of the flavorful turkey--didn't need to add any other seasonings, just a little more salt.

This is the best turkey I've ever made!  I used a turkey breast and followed the recipe except I forgot the vermouth - we didn't miss it though.  My husband went on and on about how good it was.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

This was my first GOOD turkey, or really GREAT! I was initially overwhelmed to make it, but the hardest part was separating the skin from the body, I just had the spice thyme, that was a chore chopping that up, the basting was kinda fun watching the skin get browner each time. I basted it while it was in the oven, I had read somewhere to take it out of the oven, but in the oven was fine. It was a 15 pounder, took 4 hours. It was fantastic!! It was also juicy. My sister, a very good cook, said you could taste the flavor of the turkey, everyone loved it! Thanks!

This is a fanastic recipe.  Due to what I had in the house I had to do a couple of tweeks. I Rotisseried on the BBQ instread of using the oven but I placed a tray underneather to catch the juices to great the gravey. I got a 10 lb turkey which allowed me to lift the skin from not only breast meat but the legs as well and spread the butter mixture on them as well.  I did not have chicken brooth but had veggie brooth and work great.  Thank you Edwin for sharing this recipe.  Will be making again.

Awesome, simply AWESOME!  Only changes...we stuffed the bird and roasted at 350 degrees.  The sauce was "delish"....left us begging for more.  Thank you for sharing and making our "turkey day" a memorable one.

Turkey came out amazing with this recipe!  I also stuffed it with apple stuffing, which added a nice touch. Can't wait to serve this beauty to my family for Thanksgiving tonight.

My family NEVER eats all of the turkey. After making this, there was hardly anything left to cut off the bone. It was very moist and tasted amazing. This will be in our family for a long time now. Thank you for sharing!

All I can say is.....YUM! Very flavorful. The only thing I did differently was, I cooked it at 325 degrees then I upped the temp to 425 degrees for last hour. I was scared to try and cook at it 450.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was so good I made it again for Christmas. This is my family's favorite turkey recipe now. I think this year I'm going to figure out a way to expand the gravy because we always run out.

I've only roasted a few turkeys but this was by far the best, most delicious, moist, and definitely successful one.  I loved the flavor.  The gravy was perfect.  The consensus at my house was this is a keeper.
