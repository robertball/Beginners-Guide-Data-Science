Instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder and a light dusting of salt. I also used parsley and omitted the rosemary, as it was optional. Delicious!

Recipe Group: I made this two ways. I made 2 batches of popcorn, and on the first one followed the recipe exactly. The second batch, I tailored to my own liking.  I thought the first batch was fine, but it was lacking something. On my second batch, I subbed half of the garlic salt for garlic powder. That made the garlic REALLY pop! I left out the rosemary. I popped both batches of popcorn in sunflower oil and drizzled with a tiny bit of olive oil before tossing with the seasonings.  I think this is a fun, new way to eat popcorn, I just had to tweak it a little!

Recipe Group: I will smell like garlic for days! So good! Popcorn is my favorite snack, and honestly I looked at all that popcorn and then at the 3 Tablespoons of butter and didn't think it would be enough...I was pleasantly surprised, however! Used garlic powder and table salt, and minced fresh rosemary. I had Romano cheese shreds and didn't think they would stick...again, pleasantly surprised. Couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl. Thanks for a great change of pace from Kernel Seasons white cheddar dust!

This was good!  You really can't go wrong w/popcorn, butter, cheese, and garlic!  My only caveat is that it tends toward the salty with all of those wonderful ingredients.  I'd go easy w/the garlic salt, or even cut it w/some garlic powder.  THANKS for the recipe!

What a fun, easy and tasty snack! We all loved this, even my 6-year-old grandbaby. If I can please her, it is definitely a winner. The only popcorn I had in the house was the microwave w/butter kind so I added no additional butter. We used garlic salt, parmesan and crushed rosemary. I snuck in a few shakes of a garlic/pepper blend too. Yum. It is one of my grandbaby's favorite after school snacks. I am gathering a collection of the recipes she loves. I have added this one to her collection. Thank you Pixie0019, for submitting.

Recipe Group Selection:  09, August 2014 ~ I'm a few weeks late in making the selection, but glad I did make it.  I cooked the popcorn using the 'Gourmet Microwave Popcorn' method from AR.  I made as written and liked it, but next time I will use a little less garlic salt.  The fresh Parmesan cheese add extra salt and provided a delightful taste to the popcorn.

AR Buzz Recipe Group Selection - In the opening description of this recipe, the submitter states that it is odd.  I have to agree with her.  I popped white popcorn in my microwave popcorn popper and then drizzled  unsalted butter over the top and added  1/4 t. of garlic salt, 1/4 t. of garlic powder, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and several sprinkles of rosemary. It does taste very similar to garlic bread.  In fact, I had an urge to  to drizzle it with marinara sauce.  Thanks, Pixie009 for sharing your recipe. I am just set in my ways when it comes to the way I want to eat popcorn. Give me buttered and lightly salted and I am good to go :)

Adding chopped fresh rosemary and freshly grated parmesan made a wonderful variation on the regular popcorn we are used to.  My daughter loved it.

Delish!  I am a huge fan of cheese popcorn, but after looking over the store purchased version, I was not fond of the unpronounceable list of ingredients that go in them .  I love this recipe!  Knowing what goes into it makes me feel good about indulging in my cheese popcorn cravings!  I omitted the rosemary, used 3 Tbs. of melted butter, and lots of Parmesan cheese, sea salt, and garlic powder.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Very good! I added garlic powder as well as salt so it wouldn't be too salty.

Not only does it taste nothing like garlic bread, the parmesan provides a nasty grit to the popcorn overall. Never again.
