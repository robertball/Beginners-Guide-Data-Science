I've made this twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe to the letter and found it decent but knew the recipe had potential with a little tweaking.  The second time, I did the following things to snaz it up: seasoned the beef with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, and garlic powder, browned the beef before adding it to the slow cooker, sauted 2 cups sliced mixed mushrooms and 1 onion sliced in the beef drippings before adding them to the slow cooker, deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine and added that also to the slow cooker, used 1/2 unsalted and 1/2 salted butter and then used low-salt soup mix to avoid all the saltiness.  I serve it over either egg noodles or mashed potatoes. It is now much requested in my house.

5+++++!! Great flavor - this is the second time I've made it and the first time was exactly as written and it was great that way. After reading other reviews I decided to do a bit of tampering - browning beef first, adding mushrooms, garlic and onions and a bit of red wine. Oh my! It's even better. Also towards the end I added a packet of beef gravy to thicken it up. Was lovely over mashed potatoes. Will be making this again...and again...and... : )

What a FANTASTIC treat!! Made the house smell divine!!! I used a 1.5 lb London broil (cut into cubes) and 3/4 cup butter, added a 4-oz can of unsalted mushroom pieces, and one finely chopped leek, and the one envelope of dry onion soup mix - like the recipe states.  Served over white rice and with minted peas on the side.  This was the most tender beef I've ever had!!!

This was so good!  I followed the recipe and added 1/2 chopped onion, 1 garlic clove diced, I browned the meat with seasoning (Adobo) and Worcestershire sauce.  De-lish!  Definitely a keeper and so EASY to make!

This is a great recipe.  I make this often, and it disappears fast.  I sometimes use a beef roast and after it is done cooking, shred the beef, put it back in the crock pot with all the "gravy" and let it simmer for about another 5 minutes.  This makes it extra moist, when sometimes in a crock pot the portion of meat not submerged in liquid can get over cooked.  I serve mine over my whipped potatoes. I am not a potato eater, but I will eat them with this wonderful beef on top.  Great recipe!

I did it like others, cut the butter to 1.4 cup, but floured the beef with about seasoned flour, cumin, garlic, dash of nutmeg and a little all saltfree table seasoning, then browned it off in a little olive oil and then used one large onion diced and sweated in the beef pan, then diced mushrooms, 1 cup of burgandy wine to deglaze the pan and all into the slow cooker with some worchester a little more garlic spice and some pepper, then a packet of brown gravy mix and 1/cup of water.. Lovely easy quick sort of beef burgandy flavor. Serving it with some mash potatos..and fresh peas.

Wonderful recipe - I made it "as is", but I used a packet of Roasted Garlic Onion Soup mix instead...

I served it over a bed of Jasmine Rice - and it was a HUGE hit!

I am REALLY looking forward to making this one again :)

Very tasty and so simple. I used a kilo or so of what we call gravy beef. I added a little extra butter, some garlic, couple of carrots and an onion. Superb.

This was one amazing dish! The fiance and teenage daughter (the two pickiest eaters one the planet) loved it! 3rds for the fiance! He NEVER has seconds let alone thirds!I did make sure to cook this on a Sunday, when I could be home to watch it ... I followed others advise and seared the beef (I used  already cut up stew meat)and sauteed 1/2 of a large onion diced w/severel cloves of garlic prior to adding to crockpot. I used the whole stick of butter (unsalted) and mixed the packet of onion soup mix with 1/2 cup red wine and 3/4 cup beef broth. I cooked on high for 2 hrs and low for 2 more and it was fall apart tender and sooo full of flavor! Next time (and that will be soon as the family is already asking for it again) I will use half the amount of butter and add mushrooms! Thanks for the wonderful recipe ... it will be a constant in my household thats for sure!

I seasoned beef stew cubes with pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder and then browned my beef cubes. I cooked it in my slow cooker for 8 hours. Since I was at work, I didn't have the opportunity to "stir once or twice". This step evidently is important because the tops of my beef cubes got dried out and hard. I sauteed some mushrooms and prepared a pkg of beef herb garvy mix, stirred in a can of cream of mushroom soup, mashed up the beef cubes and mixed it all together. It had a very good flavor. I served it over rotini pasta. My daughter licked her plate clean...literally. :) I'll have to try this again when I have the chance to stir it during the cooking.

I tweaked this a lot and it was fantastic. I seasoned the beef with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then tossed with the melted butter and soup mix. I then put in a small sliced onion and 1/2 cup beef broth. Let that cook for about 5 hours and then tossed in baby carrots, cornstarch and a dash of worcestershire sauce and let it sit for another hour. Absolutely delish! I really don't think the beef needs to be browned before going in the crockpot. It browned nicely on its own and was so moist and falling apart when cut with a fork.

So easy.  Made this twice.  First time with regular butter, which tasted great. I didn't think it was too salty, but my husband did.  Second time I made with unsalted butter, which was still good, but not as good as the first.  So when I try a third time I think I will use half regular and half unsalted butter to cut on the saltiness, but still have good flavor.

I love this recipe.  Have fixed it with egg noodles and mash potatos.   Only changes I have made are a little less butter.  Cut a whole onion in large slices then cut in half and cooked on low for 8 hours.  My husband isn't a fan of the crockpot, but he loves, loves, loves this meal.  Will make many many more times...revised review I didn't think there was anything to change in this recipe as it is one of our very favorites but I found something.  We have always prepared our egg noodles on the side and spooned the beef over them.  Well last time I added the noodles to the crockpot one cooked and the soaked up the flavors in the sauce.  Now we have a new way to finish off our favorite crockpot dish.  Love, love, love this dish

I forgot to buy 3lbs. stew meat and only had 1.5lbs.  I used the same amount butter and a packet of soup mix, and served over egg noodles... everyone LOVED!  Thank you for an easy great recipe.   I also served with salad and "french bread" off this site as well :)

I usually don't rate a recipe unless I've made it as written. However, most of the people who rated this recipe as good or bad changed it in some way.  As others suggested, I did brown meat first with some garlic, then sauted some mushrooms and onions and deglazed with some red wine. Used the 1/2 cup of butter and envelope of soup mix. In the end, all I could taste was the butter. The meat was very tender even after only 6 hours on low, but this didn't improve the taste. The flavor was very bland, which is surprising with the soup mix. Some reviewers stated too salty, but I didn't even notice any flavor except butter. I won't be making this again or even trying to improve upon it.

This is absolutely wonderful!!!  My husband and I are both raving about this dish.  I did make one minor modification; I seasoned the meat with steak seasoning and browned it before placing it in the crockpot.  Oh...I used Golden Onion soup mix instead of just onion soup mix.  DELICIOUS!!

O....M.....G.....This turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe as written, the only addition I made was near the end of the cooking time, it was a packet of brown gravy. I just mixed it in and let it thicken. The meat was in pretty big pieces so I took my kitchen scissors and cut them smaller. It was a hit with the hubby and all three kids! Took about 4 hours on high in the crock pot. We ate it with rice and mashed potatoes....tasted great with both. Delicious!

I cannot imagine why anyone is having a problem with this recipe.  It couldn't be any easier.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  It was excellent.  No reviewers should be surprised that the prepared dish is buttery...the recipe calls for a half cup of butter!  It also works well when using a roast instead of stew beef....in fact, we like it better that way.  Can be served with mashed potatoes as well.  Excellent recipe...thanks for sharing this one. It is a keeper!

I personally seasoned the heck out of the meat/sauce but that is due to personal preferences of bold tastes. Some garlic salt, montreal steak seasoning and lots of fresh cracked pepper.  Also added in a can of cream of mush and a few splashes (maybe 1/2 cup) of red wine.  Fabulous!

I cut up a boneless chuck roast instead of stew meat.  It came out "melt in your mouth" tender.  I'm giving it a soso rating mainly due to the fact that all you could really taste was butter.  Onion soup mix is usually pretty potent, but we couldn't even taste it.  I even added extra garlic and worcestershire to the mix.  If I make this again, I think I'd halve the butter and maybe sub olive oil for 1/4 cup, and increase the seasonings.  BTW--this didn't turn out salty--I think using unsalted butter is the key. Pretty good served over egg noodles.  Thanks for the recipe.

I purchased a new crockpot not too long ago, and since that time, I've made dinner in it about once a week. Different things..chicken & gravy, bottom round roast with fixings, pork and saurkraut....The response from the family? OK, not too bad or I really didn't care for it. Or the best one, no response at all. But this? This is a definite keeper! They raved over it so much that they want it every 4 or 5 days. And so, so easy. Five plus stars with this one!

This was absolutely excellent. . . I will admit that I was skeptical with the lack of liquid for slow cooker recipe but it turned out amazing. After reading some of the other reviews and seared my meat in a skillet with some seasoning salt and then sautéed an onion in the fat. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. AWESOME! Served it over mashed potatos and the hubby loved it!

Loved it!!!! Out of this world, will make it again and again. Put a little spin on it and added 2 cups water to make more gravy and scoop flour to thicken.

The flavor was wonderful, but there wasn't any sauce, so it was kind of dry over the egg noodles. I will try adding some broth next time so that there is a little gravy.

I made this tonight for dinner.  Since I had to go to work, I made it over rice for myself.  I thought it was very good.  My husband and son had it later on over mashed potatoes.  My husband said my son ate it, and he thought it was good, it just needed a little zest.  As for everyone who thought it was too salty... both me and my husband had to add salt to it.

This was really good.  I didn't have any problem with it coming out too salty but I did use unsalted butter.  Actually, next time I might add more salt.

I passed along this recipe to my cousin, and now the whole family knows about Butter Beef. I add a can of beef broth, and about a half hour before serving, stir a little cornstarch to thicken. I serve it either with rice or biscuits. We never have any leftovers!

I make this for my busy family quite often and they love it.  It is so easy to make.  the only thing that I do differently is that I don't use as much butter, then it is great on buns as a sandwich.  If you add a little water to make a broth, it is just as great over buttered egg noodles (my favorite).

DH raved about this one. Was a bit salty, but that's the onion soup mix. Added a small jar of drained sliced mushrooms to this. Will definitely make this again. Served over egg noodles.

The ease of this recipe is what attracted me...and I went with another's suggestion of adding a packet of brown gravy to the crockpot about 30 minutes before serving.  I did add some minced garlic and used only 2/3 a stick of butter - and it was outstanding!!!  It was so easy and so good, I didn't even have enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  Can't wait to make again!!!

I give it 5 stars with the following modifications...

Brown the beef with a lot of onion and garlic before putting in slow cooker. Use 1/2 amount of light butter. Deglaze pan with red wine. Add to cooker with onion soup mix and an extra cup of wine. 

Serve over NoYolk egg noodles (we can't tell the difference) or brown rice. booth amazing!

This made the house smell wonderful, but all the butter was a turn off for me. I think cutting down on the butter would make this a bit easier to somach for some.

Like others have said, this comes out very salty.  It had good flavor, but I think I would rather just have a roast.

A very quick and easy way to make beef tips.  If yours turned out burned it's because you didn't stir it.  I stirred mine about every hour and it came out evenly done with no burned or hard areas on the beef.  Just because it's in a crock pot doesn't mean you don't have to keep an eye on it and stir as needed.  Also, it doesn't  need hot sauce unless you want to camouflage the taste of the beef.  If you like a spicy beef dish, this isn't the one for you.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding about 1/2 stick more butter.  I used unsalted butter since the dry onion soup mix is generally a little salty.  My beef was fork tender and had a wonderful taste.  I served it over butter noodles and my family loved it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Kind of on the bland side, but I'm one that likes really spicy food so it might not be a fair rating.  Decent flavor, but a one timer.

This was a huge hit in our house. We ate this for two days straight. I did make sure to use unsalted butter and the lower sodium soup mix. I just sprinkled the soup mix over the stuff in the crockpot, I did not use the entire envelope. We boiled whole grain wide noodles and then put them in the crock pot and mixed it all up together (use a slotted spoon to serve though!) Great recipe, thanks!

Holy Cow, this is so good!!!  I hated staring at the cube of butter in my crock pot; so unhealthy.  But stuck with the recipe.  I did brown the meat before cooking all day on low.  The meat was so tender and flavorful!!!  I will half the butter next time though, I think it will be just as good.  This is a rich and satisfying meal.  Yum!

Yum!!  I've made it twice now in my slow cooker and each time I think I've died and gone to heaven.  So easy to put together, too.  I only add a couple of pounds of sliced fresh mushrooms and some garlic.  I don't like eating leftovers as a rule, but now I do!

Do not use salted butter!  I didn't pay attention and the recipes was way too salty.  I think I will make it again but next time I will coat the meat in flour and brown it on the stove in a little olive oil.  I added half a can of  beef broth to my crock pot to start it off with moisture so that the crock pot wouldn't pull the moisture from the beef.  It was very tender.  I think this recipe is a great idea.

Easy recipe!  I used London broil it was on sale.  I seared it after seasoning it with my fav steak rub.  Sliced it and added it to the crock.  I sauted onions and mushrooms in the searing pan and added those to the crock as well.  It turned out very tender and full of flavor. The soup mix was a name brand. I have used no name and they are not as tasty.  I boiled egg noodles and added straight to the crock and tossed.  No extra gravy or butter was needed.  My family enjoyed this meal.  I would say buy your meat from a good butcher not per say Wal mart because they add the sodium preservatives and it really does change the meat texture and flavor.

Love this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to sear my meat first with seasoning salt and then scattered flour in the pan to cover the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.  I found that the flour helped to create more of a gravy texture in the cooker.  This had a great, simple flavour and will definitely become a regular in our house!

I haven't made it in the crockpot yet, just do it on the stove.  Cook the meat, deglaze the pan with butter and mix in the soup mix.  I mix it into the noodles.  Have made it several times for both my family and the one I work for and everyone keeps asking to have it again.

Delicious! Easy! Used 2 lb boneless chuck roast. Cooked on low 10 hrs because we were late getting home for dinner and the meat was juicy, flavorful, fork tender. After I took the meat out, I threw in 1 envelope brown gravy mix and 1/4 cup water, put the cooker on high for 10 min to thicken up juices, perfect dinner with mashed potatoes, frozen corn and crusty bread. Thanks for great and easy recipe.  Will make over and over.

I can only give this 3 stars because as the recipe is written, it is just way too dry. After reading everyone's comments, I'll try again with some red wine for more of an au jus.

I make a very similar recipe to this with stew meat or a piece of bottom round.  I leave out the butter, but I spread a can of cream of mushroom soup on the meat when I put it in the crock pot.  When it is done, pour the juices into a smaller pot on the stove and add a large can or jar of beef gravy.  YUMMY!!!! Great served over egg noodles or next to garlic mashed potatoes.

I love this recipe!  My husband even commented a couple times that he liked it!  It's a keeper.  I used 1/2 the meat, but the same amount of butter and onion soup mix.  I do find the onion soup mix to be salty, but I just got a recipe for it and might try to make it and see if I can cut down the salt.

This was REALLY good.  I started this at about 12noon, and I forgot the onion soup mix at the store.  Cooked it on high with just the butter...plus some minced garlic and cracked pepper.  The soup mix was eventually added at 3pm.  And a pkg of brown gravy mix at 4:30.  Served at 5:30.  Super tender, lots of flavor.  Served with egg noodles, carrots and peas.

I gave this four stars because it was really good but I did have to make some changes.  I browned the beef in batches with garlic powder and cracked pepper. I then carmelized 1 small onion sliced into rings and melted the rest of the butter with it before adding it to the beef and onion soup.  I'll be reducing the butter to probably 1/3 c next time.  Also I was curious to see if this could be made in the oven as well so I baked it in a TIGHTLY covered baking dish for 3 1/2 hours at 300 degrees and it was moist and tender.  Great easy recipe.

This was a great dish. After reading the other reviews, I did a few changes of my own (also because I'm on Weight Watchers right now). First I sprayed the meat with Pam, then I tossed it with 2 Tbsp of garlic powder, 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire pepper, and 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce. I used a beef onion soup instead of regular and mixed in with the meat prior to going in the cooker. I used Imperial 1/3 fat spread instead of butter and I put in frozen green beans and diced onions. I served it over brown rice. Easy, great dish.

This is amazing. My variation included the butter, a packet of ranch dressing (powder), and a can of beef broth. I also sprinkled on some montreal steak seasoning. That was IT, and I swear to you this was the best roast I have ever cooked! It should be illegal. It is so good, and it was so big, it made THREE meals. I have been cooking roasts for over 20 years and this, by far, was the easiest (and best!)

This dish is great. I am a garlic lover and add about 5 whole cloves of garlic. I have served this over buttered egg noodles and steamed rice. The egg noodles compliment the meat much better than the rice. My husband, 4 yr old and 1 yr old enjoy this meal.

This was a great recipe. I didn't use the dried onion soup mix because typically it has way too much salt in it for my husband and me. Instead I cut up an onion in a medium dice and put that in and added some freeze dried parsley flakes. I don't have a crock pot, so I put this in a small roasting pan in the oven and covered with foil. I cooked it at 225 to start, then turned down to about 210-210 degrees. The last hour I turned back up to 225.
I used frozen stew meat. This gave it a bit of liquid, and by the time 8 hours was up that had all cooked out. My meat was fork tender, not stringy, and was delicious. Just before serving I added somem half and half and heated it through. For those who want a thicker sauce, make a roux and add to the heated  half and half. Always make a roux when making a flour based gravy. (Add the hot flour and butter mixture into the liquid, preventing lumps that way.) I found this dish was fine without the half and half sauce, and I didn't make a roux. I decided to add the half and half because it sounded good to me.
A dash of tabasco or cayenne would perk this up. Don't be afraid to tweak this recipe to your family's tastes.
Made an elegant, but very simple dish. Proves that simple is sometimes as good as the more complicated recipes. Oh, I used a little over a pound of meat and a scant 3 tablespoons of butter.

Easy.  Great taste.  Nice change from regular crockpot roast.  Make sure your stew meat is small.  Cut up if necessary.

This is so easy and has great taste. I haven't had the problem with saltiness as reported by some reviewers. Last time I made it I added fresh quartered mushrooms to the crockpot which was a nice addition. I also like to add sour cream when serving for the creaminess it gives to the sauce.

I was a little concerned about the saltiness comments posted by previous commentors, so I used unsalted butter and it came out delicious.  Also, I served it over mashed potatoes.

I  had to skim off some of the butter after it was done. We used it on sandwiches first which my husband loved then added milk and sour cream to the rest and served over noodles. I'll make this again with a little less butter.

my husband loves this!  i've made it twice now, and we've been happy with it.  i love being able to use such a cheap cut of meat and have it turn out tender and moist!  not to mention the fact that it takes five minutes to put together.  i serve this with smashed potatoes and a green salad.  the last time i made it it was a little too salty for my taste (not my husband's though!) so i added a little bit of sour cream to mine and it melted all into it and toned down the saltiness.  it was a nice fix.  thanks for a great recipe!

I thought the beef came out very tender but I didn't think this recipe was anything fantastic. I thought it could have used more spice and less butter. Overall, it was ok though.

I put this in the crockpot early with some stir fry meat I got on the cheap at the commissary. About 2 hours before it was done I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms. I did need to add some salt at the end but this was really good. My so picky husband said I could do this again. I served over rice. So simple with 3 ingredients (4 if you add mushrooms) and delicious.

Cooked exactly as written, it is wonderful.  I have to fight my men to keep them out of the crock pot until the meal is ready because they steal a taste every chance they get.  I usually use some of the liquid from the crock pot combined with water to cook the rice (ummm, it's not healthy but it's really good), or serve it over noodles.  Sometimes I'll add a couple of squirts of ketchup (just a little--don't want to taste the ketchup) and it seems to change up the flavor just a little.  This is great just as written, but it can also be tweaked a thousand ways.  One of my top ten recipes from this site.

Followed the recipe pretty much except I used a light butter. Smelled delicious and didn't disappoint in the taste department. My husband had seconds on the meat. So tender! Can't wait until the cooler weather to make it again.

This was great! I browned the meat before hand, added a can of mushroom pieces and stems, I sauted some onions as well and threw them in there. I used unsalted butter and it turned out just right. I also sprinkled some garlic powder in the crock after all was mixed in. 3.5 hrs on high for less than a lb of stew meat, low for another hour or so.

Killer beef..loved it! I did augment recipe by adding several tablespoons of crushed, fresh garlic, and also substituted the butter with Brummel & Brown yogurt butter. Simple and really tasty, with leftovers.

My husband and I loved the concept of this receipe and totally enjoyed what we ended up with.  I need to try it again exactly as written as when I went to assemble it I realized I had failed to purchase onion soup mix!  So, I had to tweak...carmelized a diced onion then deglazed pan with some red wine and added to the beef and butter in crockpot.  Added a tablespoon of beef stock mix.  Before serving I thickened juices with cornstarch.  Served with roasted veggies and yeast rolls.  Outcome was fabulous but will make again true to recipe as written.  The meat cooked up beautifully!  Four starts is simply because of the cost...meat was pricier than what I had anticipated.  Will look for it to be on sale in the future!

This was ok. It was a little too salty and my daughter didn't like that. I served it over mashed potato's, but the gravy part was really greasy which turned me off a bit. I think if I just strained the meat out next time it would be better.

I made this according to the recipe but added a can of cream of broccoli soup because I cooked it on high and the broth was drying up.   Still a good base recipe to adjust to taste - added peas and onions and served over noodles.

Amazing! I did use red wine and a little onion from other suggestions and this is so good. Served over egg noodles. I try not to have seconds of anything but I could not resist this one! Reheated great too. This will go on the regular rotation!

The way I made this is actually 5 stars, but I'm giving it 4 because I had to "doctor" it up!  I browned the meat in olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt and pepper on it.  I also added a healthy dose of worchestershire and sprinkled the onion soup on while browning.  Served over egg noddles and it was quite fabulous!

This was delicious, inexpensive and definitely easy to prepare.  I took other reviewer's advice and seared the meat and added about 1/4 c of sauted onions that I just happened to have on hand.  I served it with egg noodles and my family was very pleased.

I made this for Sunday night supper. It was very tasty. I added half a can of beef broth so I could have more gravy. I also added half of a chopped oinion for extra flavor. I served it over egg noodles. Very yummy!

One of my FAVS!!!  I have adapted this recipe into a 'cook once eat twice meals'!   I use the recipe faithfully (OK...I add onions and a bit of fresh garlic BUT that is standard in my house in almost ALL recipes).  Cook as directed....very good!  BUT I did not find the 'gravy' thick or enough for my family.  So I add at least one dry small package of brown gravy and some beef broth (I normally get a large carton of beef broth...use some when making the butter beef and then use the rest when I make stew).  The first night, I serve it over mashed potatoes.  THEN for the second meal out of this recipe I make beef stew.  I use the rest of beef broth, butter beef, mixed vegs and potato soup to make beef stew.   I love my CrockPot, AllRecipes and Butter Beef!!!

I made some of the changes a lot of other people did.  I browned my beef first with sea salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  Then I added an onion sauteed in the beef drippings.  It smelled and tasted great, but was a little heavy with all the butter cooked into the beef.

I made this in the crockpot as stated in the recipe. I was skeptical from the start about not adding water to the pot. Well, sure enough when my husband came home around 1:00 the meat had already started to stick and burn.He wound up adding two cups of water to the pot. I had set it on low at 9 that morning. Did anybody else have this problem? What am I doing wrong? Also, the liquid seemed greasy. I took others advice and added a packet of gravy which helped.

This beef really does melt in your mouth like butter....IF you have good beef. I've made this twice now- the first time I used beef we had gotten from a 1/4 cow we had purchased and it was HEAVEN! I did brown the meat beforehand and added some browning sauce to the pan. I also threw in a pint of sliced fresh mushrooms. The second time I made it exactly the same way, but I used some beef that I had purchased at Wal-Mart. Still tasty, but HUGE difference in the texture. If you can afford it and you have room to store it, buy a portion of a cow. They don't add fillers to the meat at the butcher's like they do in stores.

I just made this for dinner and my kids ate it all, none left for their dad!  I didn't add the soup mix until 2 hours left of cooking, but it still came out delicious!!!!  We ate it over rice.  My poor husband was looking forward to it, but I didn't want to tell the kids they couldn't have seconds-- they rarely eat the first plate!  It was so easy I'll make another batch tomorrow and double it so he can have a lot.   I wonder if whomever rated it as bland used a bad soup mix?  Ours rocked!!

I was hoping to really like this recipe.  I love all the ingredients but even my salt eating husband couldn't eat it.  If I would have had some red wine I would have tried that but I didn't.  I added one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cheddar cheese, some reg mayo, some miracle whip and cream to try to take some of the saltiness out and managed to some degree but I still got four nose crinkles.  It is definately not something we wlll try again.  Sorry but keep them coming.

I'm sure the recipe would have been good as written, but in an effort to add some vegetables, I did follow some of the recommendations to add onion and mushrooms (and a little red wine 'cause what doesn't taste better with a little red wine) and this was delicious.

I've never used a crock pot before so this was my first time. I messed up a little by adding water to the pot and not adding the butter and putting 2 extra packets of onion soup. When I realized my mistake an hour later I tasted the broth. It was thin so I added the butter and some grape vinegar. I didn't want to add any salt because of the extra onion soup packets. I figured once some of the liquid evaporated, the salt would be fine.
I cooked it the recommended time and cooked it on high for the last hour with the lid slightly ajar to let out more steam. I took out a cup of broth and added some cornstarch to it. Mixed it with the broth and repeate until it made a gravy with a good consistency. It came out really nice! The vinegar gave it a beautiful taste and my family loved it. I served it with flavored rice and lemon corn. I will make this again!

This recipe is very easy, and very good.  I made it when my room mate was sick, and told him it was in the fridge.  It didn't last long, with him at home eating it.  It goes great over egg noodles.  One change to the recipee was to add some minced garlic to the mix, which turned out great!

SUPERB! Imade this using the tips from VORCHA and it was fabulous I will must certainly be making it again, as the family loved it.  I used a joint of beef and cooked it whole.  Once cooked I blitzed the onions, mushrooms and sauce to make the gravy, wonderful over mashed potato.

My husband loved this! I was thinking it would be like beef floating around in butter, but quite the contrary, served with rice or noodles, this was a huge hit! And it literally took like 3 minutes to prepare in the crock pot in the morning.  Definitely a keeper.

I made it as specified- & I didn't find it half bad! Not too salty or greasy, but I did use Laura's Lean Stew Meat. Cooked 8 hours on low. Used Whole Foods Buttery Sticks for the butter. (less sat fat) I think I will spice up the leftovers for shredded beef burritos!!!

Very good! I served it over whole wheat pasta and followed other reviewers suggestions of cutting back on the butter and adding minced garlic (4 tsp worth because we love it). Next time I might try adding some other herbs, but the meat was wonderfully tender and flavorful.

We were not impressed with this dish.  
Preparing it according to the recipe, we didn't like it at all.  The onion soup taste was overwhelming and there was so much butter that the meat was greasy.  I gave it another chance by preparing it with a brown gravy packet, as some other reviewers recommended and while that was a bit better, we won't be making this one again.

This is ok to start with but definitely needs some work.  Next time I will Cut the butter back to 1/4 cup, add 1 can of beef broth, 1 can of mushroom soup, and some fresh mushrooms.  I wouldn't make it again as is because my family just wasn't impressed by it.

Meat was extremely tough, and all you could taste was onion soup mix. I wasn't a fan of it, but my fiance and one of our friends liked it.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and mixed a packet of brown gravy with water and added that plus some carrots and an onion. Used only half the butter. Turned out very well. Gravy would be perfect for mashed potatos. Even picky 6 & 4 year olds liked it.

Very Yummy!  A few changes.  Used 1 1/2 lbs. of lean stew meat which I browned in olie oil, garlic & greek seasoning.  In crock pot I used 1/4 cup of butter, 1 can of beefy mushroom soup,1 packet of onion soup mix, 1 cup of beef broth then added stew meat.  Cooked this on low for about 5 hrs.( was done in 3hrs.) then added a little roux to thicken gravy and  fresh mushrooms cooked for about 45 min. longer. Did not need any extra salt.  If you are not a big salt fan I would use unsalted butter and low sodium broth.  Will make again!!!

I always cook beef in the slow cooker, and I've never had the need to add a stick of butter to it. It was lots of unnecessary fat that made the dish too greasy and didn't add to the flavor of the beef at all. You're much better off using a can of cream of mushroom soup along with the packet of soup mix to get a good gravy. Won't make this again.

This recipe was just okay. It wasn't terrible, and in a pinch or a hurry, I would make it again. But to me, it just tasted like regular old beef tips, with nothing to special. The name was more appealing than the actual meal, but I will say this is a great choice if you have very limited time and resources!

Very easy to make, although I thought the gravy was too watery, maybe I used too much butter? My husband loved it. I liked it, I felt the beef was a little too cooked. I added some baby carrots and they tasted great. Next time, I will thicken it up, maybe with some cream of mushroom soup or flour. Thanks!

I did change a few things about this recipe, but overall think it is wonderful and will make again and again.

I halved the beef & butter, but forgot to 1/2 the onion soup mix, so I added a can of cream of mushroom to cut the saltiness.  I love the taste that the mushroom soup brings to this.  I also browned my meat before putting it in with the other ingredients.

I haven't served it yet, as my husband isn't home from work, but will serve over egg noodles or biscuits!  YUMMY!  Thanks for the easy, great recipe.

Like everyone else said....TOO SALTY!  I used light margarine, and low sodium onion mix, 1/2 the package, yet still salty.  Meat was also dry.  So instead of wasting the meat, I gave it a second life by making it into ground beef (grinding it up itnt he blender) and adding a bit of mrs dash and other spices to give it a second life into homemade tacos instead.--Now that was yummy!

Following the advice of another reveiwer, I used 1.5 lbs of beef, 3/4 cup of butter and 1 package of onion soup mix.  I had to drain a bit of oil off the top before serving, but other than that it wasn't bad.  I will probably only use half the amount of butter called for next time (along with 1.5 lbs of beef).  This was good...quite salty, so don't add additional salt!!  All in all - it was good...but I just felt guilty eating it so it won't be in the regular rotation I'm afraid.  The only other change I made was to stir some cornstarch and water together toward the end to thicken the sauce; we served this over egg noodles.

This was a tasty recipe. I followed exactly, and it came out nice and tender. I served over buttered egg noodles.

This recipe is SUPER EASY and we were thrilled with the results.  Next time, I plan to add a can of mushrooms to add to the flavor, although it really doesn't need them.  With just three ingrediants & a crock pot, just how much easier can it get????
Awesome!

This is the perfect meal to fix in the am and come home to.  I used 1/3 C of the drippings to make a seperate brown gravy and served with mashed potatoes.

My 12 yr old son made this by himself before school....The whole house smelled good when we got home that afternoon!  Not only did it taste great, even to my picky 8 yr old son, but I didn't have to lift a finger.  THAT ALONE EARNS 5 STARS!!!!!

This one was a hit! The only thing I had to do was thicken the sauce a little, I found it a little too runny - the family loved it!
Thanks B's Kitchen - will definately do this one again!

Sorry, this recipe was awful.  It has my two favourite food groups (butter and beef) but the result was inedible.  My husband wouldn't even finish his 1st helping and he usually eats 3.

I made mine based on what I had and other reviewers. Had frozen chuck steak- cut it up partially frozen into strogonoff type strips, added 1 & 1/2 chopped onions, 1/2 c bacon lardons fried crisp, 1 lb sliced fresh mushrooms fried, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 stick butter- 1 c low sodium chicken broth, dried garlic and penzey's chicago steak seasoning plus a couple dash's worstchesire sauce. all together in the crock pot-smells great!

I made this tonight for dinner and I also made changes since reading the reviews. I had a large group of people so I used about 6 lbs of beef, 3 packets of onion soup mix, 2 medium onions, 2 shallots, 16oz of fresh mushrooms, about a cup of merlot and 4cups of beef stock. I dredged my meat in flour and placed it in the slow cooker. I sautéed the onion, shallot and mushrooms in olive oil and butter till soft, then added 3 garlic cloves and the wine and let it reduce by half and added that to the meat. I sprinkled the soup mix on top and then added the beef stock, put only 1 stick of butter in and I put it on low for 8.5 hours and it made a nice rich thick gravy. It was very easy to make put it over noodles had a green salad and crusty bread. Everyone loved it and there weren't any leftovers!! Thank you for such a versatile recipe.

Nice flavor but would be too dry as written. I added 1 cup of beef broth and most of the meat was wonderfully tender, but the few pieces that weren't covered by the broth were dry.   I added cornstarch at the end to thicken then served over noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

I had a beef cross-cut hind shank and was looking for a way to cook it as I had never prepared this cut of meat before. This recipe created a magical gravy that my family practically drank by itself. I prepared the dish in my slow-cooker and added some beef stock (for extra sauciness), garlic, parsley, mushrooms and a few chopped onions. I used the Beefy Lipton Onion Soup mix. I served the beef & gravy ladled over twice-baked mashed potatoes. HUGE hit in my house, and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender. If you have never cooked a hind shank I highly recommend it for the slow-cooker, as it is inexpensive and delicious.  Will certainly add this recipe to my favorites!

Not bad, but awfully rich (duh, what did I expect with 1/2 cup of butter in the recipe?!).   It wasn't as flavorful as I had expected from reading the reviews.  A bit too salty.  In short, it wasn't good enough to justify the substantial fat and calorie load.

This recipe is a delicious favorite that we come back to over and over again!  To cut out the msg do like we do, use just a stick of butter, a few tablespoons of dehydrated onion, and high quality salt.  It tastes every bit as yum.  Your family will thank you.

So easy and good! Since it is just my husband and I, we cut the meat and onion soup packet in half, but kept the butter the same. It made a perfect amount of sauce. We cooked it on low for 6 1/2 hours, and then at the last half hour we added about 4 T flour and 1/4 c. half and half. I don't know if that was necessary because it was good before the additions, but it made it like a stroganoff.  I served over egg noodles mixed with sour cream and pepper. I did brown the meat a little before adding it to the crock pot - olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I used unsalted butter in the crock pot, but I think I'll use regular next time. A great, easy recipe! Thanks B!

This was good and smell delisous when cooking. I burnt it the first time in the crockpot I think it just needs some liquid. I added some beef broth the next time and it turned out really good.

I doubted this as it was cooking- and worried when I stuck my finger in about half way through- but it turned out GREAT! My family loved it. I did brown the meat in red wine first, as someone had suggested. I seasoned the meat with a little more then salt and pepper- used a steak seasoning as well. I will make this again!

This was okay. We all ate it but were not excited about it. As others said it was a bit on the salty side but there was plenty of gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. I wish we had all liked it more because it was definately easy but really not worth making again.

Pretty good, although I felt like it needed more sauce for putting it on the noodles.

I followed some of the suggestions and sauted onions, mushrooms and the beef before adding them all to the crockpot with the butter and onion soup mix.  It turned out great and went well over egg noodles.

Very tasty... but all that butter cannot be healthy! But then again, it's what makes it so good!  It's perfect for those cheap cuts of beef because it makes it tender.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe and we all loved it!   The only thing my husband added was some pepper and worcestershire sauce to his plate.  Might try adding that in the crockpot next time, but honestly I love it as is!

An easy quick recipe to make before you go to work. I thought this was ok but not great. It was a little too greasy for us. Overall 3 star recipe.

Made it as is and it was very good.  I used 1 lb of stew meat on low for 4-5 hours. This was a bit too long and the uncovered meat did toughen up a bit.  Using the left over juice we added 2 c. of water 1 c. of flour, cheyenne pepper, salt and pepper. It made a great dinner!

We made this the day before Christmas Eve, which was a mistake because our house smelled like onion stew for DAYS after, and we had people coming over. I made the recipes as is, and the meat tasted good (but salty!) The problem was that there wasn't any sauce. I think it would have been better if there were some sauce to poor over the noodles,  because it was pretty much meat chunks on plain noodles. I did what someone else suggested and put a little sour cream in the noodles, and that was a little better. I won't be making this recipe again.

I mde this last night, and truthfully didn't think it was going to be good. Howver, I was looking for something easy for my beef eating son, because my chicken eating daughter wanted chicken marsala. Well, not only did my beef eating son love it, but my chicken eating daughter tried it, and then had seconds! KUDOS! I made mine according to directions, except I did brown the cubes in some olive oil before crock pot. I served with parsley buttered wide egg noodles, and steamed peas. I will make this again soon!

This is the perfect winter dish, it warms you right up and the left overs taste just as good. I added sour cream and flour at the end to thicken the sauce. I pan seared the meat and seasoned it. Thank you so much!

My husband loves this!  He likes beef very simple and no gravy but wants some flavor.  This is just the thing for him.  Always looking for good slow cooker recipes and this one makes the permanent rotation.  Easy and simple to throw together in the slow cooker.

So easy! My daughters (4 and 6) "helped" make it, which of course made them like it that much more. I served it over noodles and froze the leftover beef, which thawed well for dinner a couple weeks later. Quick, easy, and delicious. Thanks!

We loved this and will be making it again. We made it almost as described--only used less butter (margarine). We served it over mashed potatoes with a side of green beans. Delicious!

Very good! I added some chopped onion, green onions and seasoned the meat with adobo, garlic powder and pepper. As suggested i added some gravy mix to it to thicken it up. I also added sour cream to the noodles! I will try it next time with rice! This was a big hit! my family loved it!

This was delicious. I had a very old, tough cut of meat in my freezer that I didn't know what to do with and this was perfect! I did the recipe as is, just added a basic gravy recipe (simmer butter and onion, stir in flour, then mix in beef broth) for the last 3 hours of cooking. Next time I will probably cut back on the butter, that's my only adjustment.

this was wonderful after I revised it a lot. I changed the onion soup to onion mushroom and added 1 med onion chopped, 1 lb baby portabello mushrooms, a heaping tbs minced garlic and at the end mixed it with homemade pasta.  My entire family LOVED it!!

This meal is so easy to make and it's Awsome!! I followed the recipe as it is but I made egg noodles and put corn in it. You could also use some onion and mushrooms instead if you wanted. I thickened up the sause to make it more like a gravy. This meal was soooo good I will be making it again!!

Excellent recipe, so easy.  I also found that I had to add some water so the meat would not burn.

I've made this recipe several times, but always with some changes.  I season the beef with salt and pepper, add garlic, mushrooms and 1/2 cup of red wine.  I also thicken it at the end using beef broth and a little cornstarch.

This is a great dish!  This tastes just like a pot roast, but you don't need to buy a big block of meat for the dish!  Whenever I try and make a pot roast, I never know if I'm buying the right cut of beef so the meat will fall apart like I want it too.  This is just perfect for me and my husband!

Great flavor...I did brown the beef cubes before adding to crockpot & also added 1/2 onion & chickenstock to de-glaze the pan before adding the fried onions to the crockpot with the beef. We served this over regular 'ol steamed rice. I will make this again. Warning: This IS very rich...we couldn't eat as much of this as we wanted to.

Love it exactly as written. It is perfect served over mashed potatoes. I hate beef stew and figured I didn't like stew meat. Not true! I love this, and now make it twice a month.

I really wanted to like this one because it was so easy to prepare.  In truth, I was surprised by the lack of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as I usually do the first time.  I think it might be better with some tweaks, but I don't think we liked it enough to mess with it.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe today and was so excited to taste it!  It was so easy and was very delicious.  The only modification I made was to add some chopped carrots and onions about halfway through to give it a little bit more heartiness.  Great recipe!

i put everything in the crock pot before i left for work and i was so looking forward to dinner all day. but i was very disappointed when i got home. it was a pot w a lot of nice chunks of meat just swimming in a bunch of grease.  and the onion soup sauce was really overwhelming. i took a piece out and let it sit on a napkin for a few minutes and tried it. very strong flavor but not in a good way. this was such a waste of a good piece of meat.  i will not try this again. sorry.

This was easy. I added wild mushrooms about 30mins before serving. I still thought it was rather bland. I will not be making this again.

Simple and Filling! Great Autumn meal. I did add 1/4 cup of red wine, parsley, garlic, season salt, and black pepper the 2nd time I made it and served it with sour cream. This made it taste more like a stroganoff. Following the recipe as it is (like I did the first time) made a lighter dish that was still very good.

This recipe was pretty bleh. Even after jazzing it up the second time around with mushrooms, green beans and some beef stock this still came out very flavourless. I will probably not make this again as I have better beef slow cooker recipes that my family enjoys.

We made this exactly per the recipe and all I can say is that it was not to our liking.  Salty to the point of being inedible.  We even tried to fix it up into a strogonoff-type dish and it was still a no go.

So easy and delicious! I did substitute Trim Bullion Mix  from the trim healthy mama cookbook rather than the onion soup mix called for. Served over dreamfield  pasta and it was a hit! I'm making it again tonight.

I was worried that this would be a little bland.  So, I added 4 cloves of garlic.  The garlic totally dissolved into the sauce.  I couldn't even tell it was in there.  Six people ate this and loved it. My husband said this is the next best thing to steak. High praise indeed.  I thought the texture seemed more like roast than a stew meat.  Not my thing.

I made this to the letter but I had to add a little water halfway through or it would have burnt out. And it was SO good. My fiance doesn't have many back teeth so normally when I make any kind of beef he can't eat it and he had two helpings of this. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

That was great! I shake some "Mrs. Dash "Garlic and herbs" on beef and added half cup of red wine. Also I had more than 3lb of meat so I used 2 envelopes of dry onion soup mix. I cooked on high for ~2hrs, then on low for ~6hrs. Served over baked white rice. When next day I was reheating leftovers at work 3 coworkers asked what that delicious smell was. Definitely will make it again! Next time will add some baby carrots - they will add sweetness to the beef. Thank you for that recipe!

I followed the directions to cook on low and the beef turned out horrible.  Having nothing but butter and meat juices made this a greasy mess...I can see if you twick this recipe it could be good but in it's current state, it makes me wonder what is wrong with the rating system.

This is GREAT - however to get the flavor to come out - I added 3 packets of lipton onion soup mix - and cooked it in 1 cup of butter (not margarine) and cooked it on low for over 10 hours :)  It was AWESOME served over noodles - I stirred in a little corn starch to thicken the juice just a little - it really was a GREAT recipe!!  :)

This was really good.  I did brown the meat per others recommendations.  I also only used 1/2 of the onion soup mix.  When the meat was done I strained the juices into my fat separator and and only used the juices without all the fat, added about two cups of water, put it in a sauce pan and thickened it with Wondra and poured it back over the meat in the crockpot to keep it war.  We served it over mashed potatoes.  GREAT!   Will definitely make again

Believe it or not, I substituted chicken tenders for the beef.  It was delicious served over egg noodles.  I added a little garlic for more flavor.  Very yummy! :)

Excellent. I cooked my first piece of beef ever in my crockpot and used this recipe. We all loved this. Tender, juicy and delicious! My 12 year old had seconds. I sliced the beef over a garden salad and added shredded chedder cheese as a garnish.

I followed the basic recipe and though it was quite good, I also thought it was a little too salty. I will try it again with a few modifications.

SOOOO GOOD!  I followed some other reviewers advise and browned the beef first.  To save some prep time, I used the already cut up beef from the grocery store - the one that's meant for fajitas.  Anyway, I added about 1/2 cup red cooking wine, onion powder and garlic to the butter.  I browned the beef in this awesome beef seasoning I found at Costco.  SOOO good - wonderful over buttered egg noodles.  My picky 7 year old even ate it and she doesn't eat ANYTHING!  Thanks for sharing!

My family really enjoyed it! I cooked it on low for 8 hours in the crock pot and it was extra tender, just fell apart. I did add a package of beef gravy with water as suggested by others. As leftovers I served it on buns topped with horseradish sauce ~~~ excellent!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and EASY!!! I make it often and my four kids and husband love it. I mix it together the night before and refrigerate and pop it in the slow cooker and go. Sometimes I add a can or jar of gravy at the end if I happen to have one in the pantry, but you don't need it. Yummy! Thank you for the recipe!

I liked it--mostly because it tastes like my mother's pot roast, which is comfort food.  I used 2 packets of soup mix instead of one, and thickened the juices at the end with flour/water, but the family liked it best as sandwiches the next day--with the thickened sauce, when it was cold it stuck together really well.  I'd like to add something to it, but I don't quite know what.  My husband found the taste a little dull.

I made this last night. It was okay nothing spectacular though. Everyone ate it but I did add the package of brown gravy and 1/2 c of water near the end as it was pretty oily looking...don't think this is something they'll be requesting but a great option for stew beef.

Since there are only two of us now, I cut the recipe in half, and cooked on high for 2.5 hours. I also added some cracked pepper and garlic, as many other reviews suggested. It was wonderful...and super-easy!

Awesome, awesome, awesome. So easy because these ingredients can be kept on hand frozen and nonperishable. My one caveat it that cooking it on high, even with some stirring, burnt really easily for me. I always keep what I need for this on hand for those days I wake up and realize I have no dinner, but enough time to keep on low, and it's totally worth it.

I wanted to like this recipe, but it was too bland and oily.  I cut the butter down to just barely 1/4 cup.  I did brown the meat with onion and garlic.  When almost ready to serve, I tasted and it had no flavor to it.  I tried to doctor it up by adding some garlic salt, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.  When my daughter tried it she just shrugged her shoulders and said that it is not a favorite.

Always a favorite, I have passed this recipe on so many times.  Even to the woman at the local meat shop when she asked me a good way to use stew beef.  My kids love it, can be served with some additions for a special meal, or as is for an easy make-ahead weekday dinner.  Thanks so much!

I was skeptical that a recipe with so few ingredients would turn out this well, but it was excellent! I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic and an extra pinch of dried onion. Make sure to stir every hour, and it turns out great. I served mine with rice.

This is a great recipe! I've made it several times, and I won't soon stop making it. It's great to be able to wake up in the morning and throw this on real fast. I make a gravy out of the juices and serve it over mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend loves it! Thank you for the recipe.

This is very good.  The meat is very tender.  My kids absolutely love it and now request it.  I added some mushrooms to the meat and I add a 1/2 cup of butter to the noodles.  Very good.

I turned this on low as I headed to work, like I normally do with crock pot meals, but when I got home the meat was very, very dry.  I had even added wine as suggested in other reviews.  If I try to make this again, I will make sure to stay at home and stir it often.  That being said, the flavors were all there and had a lot of potential!

Very good as is, but my family would have preffered it on mashed potatoes instead of noodles. Wine in the sauce would make it a little more special, and it can be dressed up so many ways. My husband said it was like stroganoff, but no cream. We loved it.

This was a very good recipe.  I added lots of onion to my pot.  I also served it on top of mashed potato, the juice ws runny but the potato absorbed it pretty well.  will keep this one

I'm not sure if it was something I did, or if I just have REALLY different tastes...but I couldn't even eat this.  It was over cooked and hard before 4 hours of cooking time.  It smelled HORRIBLE while cooking.

Very good dinner dish.  The meat did shred, but it was still very nice and tender, with a good flavor.  I halved the butter, added sliced onions and water.  Served over twice-baked mashed pototoes with a side salad.

This was okay... maybe a 3 and a half.  It was kind of like the beef and noodles my mom used to make just without the mashed potatoes.  I probably won't make it again though.

I really wanted to to like this one... but even with all the suggestions fellow reviewers gave, it came out tasting like a dry, under seasoned potroast.  Not too bad, but not too good either.  If you're feeling so inclined, the recipe can certainly be tweaked for the palate, but personally I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I did take the advise of a couple of you who rated this.
I added 
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
1 can milk
3/4 cup sour cream
and pepper
this was WONDERFUL, I plan on making this at least 2x a month.
I served over mashed potatoes, yummy! Thanks for the great ideas

I was not impressed with this recipe...the meat was tender but it looked very unappetizing and tasted very bland. I would not make this one again.

I made this and thought it was pretty tasteless. The meat turned out very tender, but most meats do if you cook them long enough. I had to skim off the fat and used the drippings as a sauce. served over the noodles. Had to add salt, and I hardly ever add salt to my food after cooking. My family 2 kids ate the meat with ketchup and left the rest. (they were full) uh huh.
The leftovers are still in the fridge. Would not ever make this again.

This was very easy!  The sauce was a little thin.  Next time I would half the meat, for 2 people, it was A LOT of food and the leftovers didn't refridgerate well.  But it was great fresh!

Had good flavor so it would be a good base for a stew or something else, but for my family's taste - not just served over noodles.

I made this following the recipe except I browned the beef cubes first, added some beef broth and thickened the sauce a bit at the end. Served it over egg noodles AND we loved it! It is definitely a "keeper" recipe!

I have made this many times. The basic recipe is real good but it leaves so much room for improvement and interpretation. Add more garlic, onions, red wine, red pepper flakes, whatever to really make it pop.

We love it as is or spruced a bit. Sometimes things we add mushrooms, add 1/4 red wine, and/or add a packet of gravy in the last 20 minutes. Truly, it’s great as is. We prefer to serve with broad noodles.

We will be having this again.  Thinking of trying it over mashed potatoes and rice as well.  Loved how easy it was.  Great considering I'm in school full time.

We each are an embarrassing amount of this. The only change I made was to add some sliced baby bella mushrooms because I had some to use up, and next time I would do that again plus add onions. Yum!!!

I really liked the flavor of this, but it was pretty greasy, so I think I will leave out the butter next time.  I used the variations that VORCHA has on her review.  It took me about an hour to get it in the slow cooker, so not an Easy Prep meal, but totally worth browning the meat first.

Super easy to make!  It was delicious.  The meat got a little "crispy" but it added a ton of flavor.  I tried it a second time and added more "broth" but it takes away from some of the flavor of the meat so it's better to follow the recipe.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter and found it decent but knew the recipe had potential with a little tweaking.  I floured the beef with seasoned flour, cumin, garlic, Then I browned it off in a little olive oil and then used  one large onion diced and sweated in the beef pan, deglazed the pan with 1 cup of burgandy wine and with some worchester. I added that also to the slow cooker, used 1/2 unsalted and 1/2 salted butter and. I serve it over either egg noodles.

Follow the recipe, but it just didn't seem complete. It was missing some seasonings plus extra ingredients to make it a winner.

My kids aren't crazy about them, but I love them, and my hubby would eat the whole pot if I let him. LOL If I have time, I brown the cubes beforehand, but it's great just like this, too. We usually pair it with rice, though.

I wanted to love this, I really did ...... but I didn't.  :(  I added a little garlic and some red wine thinking that would take it over the top, but I was super disappointed and can't see myself making this again.

Doctored with about 1/4 cup cabernet, some mushrooms, garlic and about 1 tbs gravy mix.  OK, but this isn't a keeper.

I browned the beef just a bit (chopped some boneless chuck ribs), added marinated whole mushrooms, some garlic and a little wine.  Served over linguine.  I'm gonna try again and add sliced sweet onion, marinated mushrooms again, and try serving over mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Simple crock pot recipe that's great for busy days.  Not my favorite because I'm not a huge fan of stew beef, but you can't beat the ease, and the rest of the family likes it.  I served it over egg noodles.

Pretty good for such few ingredients.  Even my picky 19 month old ate it up.  It's a little high in sodium and fat though.  I'm wondering if there's a way to lighten it up.

I changed it slightly to make it crockpot friendly. The only thing different I did was to add some beef broth. It was amazing! I will make it again many more times.

This was good but way too salty. I want to make it again because it was so easy & cheap. Next time though I will add maybe 2 tbs of brown sugar to balance out the salt, or maybe add potatoes to absorb some of the salt.

My Fiance and I really enjoyed this!  We did add an onion and some garlic.  We also thickened the sauce with cornstarch and alittle gravy master. As stated in previous rating, this is a slowcooker dish that you should be around to stir as the meat did clump together.  All in all, very tasty!  We served over buttered noodles.  Will do again

I set my crock pot on low 8 hrs and had to turn it off 1 1/2 hrs before. The meat was getting dry. I had to add a little of heavy cream to moisten it up. I also added sliced mushrooms and served over the noodles. It had good flavor but seemed as if it was missing something. My spouse liked it more than me.
