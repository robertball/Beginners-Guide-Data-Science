I know some people don't want a reviewer to give a rating based on changes made in the original recipe.  I really enjoy reading all the ways people make a certain recipe their own and I feel if a reviewer wants to give the original recipe 5 stars then that's just fine. So...I really wanted to make this but didn't have the exact ingredients.  I am putting my changes in this review so people can see there is a lot of latitude in making this and it still turns out great.  First I cut the recipe in half as I made it mostly for my 8 y/o.  Only had about a half pound of ground beef which I browned with a few additional spices. I used rigatoni noodles.  I didn't have a small can of tomato sauce so added some tomato paste to the browning meat. I left out the mushrooms. The rest of the recipe I followed but I kept a bit of the pasta water before draining to add back to the pasta before adding the sauce.  It helps the sauce incorporate with the pasta (according to Rachael Ray :) ).  My son's verdict was  that it tasted just like real pizza. I am sure I will try this again with different pizza topping ingredients.  The title really says it all...KID'S favorite pizza casserole.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Less expensive and faster than ordering a pizza. I used only one bag of Pizza Blend Cheese (2 cups, shredded.) I also added a teaspoon or two of Pizza Seasoning to the ground beef. If you're looking for a kid-pleasing dish, try this quick, easy and cheesy casserole.

First time I made this as the recipe stated, and everyone loved it. The second time I used our favorite pizza ingredients.I used Italian Turkey Sausage links that I sautéed with chopped green peppers and yellow onion Omitted the mushrooms and substituted sliced black olives. It is definitely a keeper!

Altered this recipe a bit:  Used 1 lb beef, 2 c of elbow noodles, 4oz jar of pizza sauce, 8oz can of tomato sauce, turkey pepperoni,  shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 tsp garlic salt, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  When I browned the beef, I sprinkled in some dried onion.  Used the layer method described, but put the pepperoni in between the layers.  Turned out awesome!  I will definitely need to double the recipe as it was gobbled up in no time!

I made this, with some changes and my kids and hubby loved it! First of all, instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey breast. I always cook my meat with water in it and lots of spices (Garlic Mrs. Dash), so I just added the macaroni noodles and cooked both at the same time.
We like supreme pizza with loads of veggies, so I sauteed a large red onion, one large green pepper, a couple of stalks of celery and two cartons of mushrooms, and several cloves of garlic in some EVOO. Before I put any of the veggies in the pan, I added fennel and the garlic to the oil, just to flavor it. 
When all was done, I combined, placed in glass casserole dish and baked as directed. Served up with a nice salad and garlic knots! 
My 8 year old son said it was amazing and actually wanted to take some for lunch. My 16 year old daughter said it was "BOMB!"
Easy on the wallet, easy prepping, and absolutely delish!

Sort of lame.....American Style Goulash but baked....and most all the kids I know hate mushrooms.  Almost nice try.  Sub a real veg for the shrooms (bell pepper) or add pepperoni and make it meatier.

Delicious, easy meal! I took other recommendations and added pepperoni and left out the mushrooms. I also mixed the meat and sauces before I added the macaroni. My husband is the picky one and he liked it as much as my one year old!

As written I found it not terrible, but too bland. With changes I'd give it 4 stars. It needs garlic and onion and I replaced the hamburger with hot Italian sausage.

I added italian sausage and skipped the mushrooms for my husband.  He was happy to get "pizza" and I was happy to have something different.

This casserole is great!  My kids (ages 1 and 4) loved it!  I skipped the mushrooms since I'm the only one who likes them and added a few slices of pepperoni.

Budget friendly recipe. Easy enough for novice cooks to follow. Enjoyed by mom, dad, a three year old and 19 month. Perfect for the family.

I seasoned the beef with onion power, garlic salt, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. 

The only ingredient I added was four handfuls of fresh spinach that I added to the cooked groundbeef. After the spinach wilted, I moved over this combination to the bowl to mix with the other ingredients.

Will make it again, I couldn't eat it  due to diet restrictions, but family loved it. Not everyone likes mushrooms, so I added olives and some turkey pepperoni. Also, a little garlic powder and Italian seasoning.

Ok so I made this recipe as it was.  Quick and simple. Everyone loved it. I think I will use fresh mushrooms next time though. My granddaughter can't get enough of it so that makes it a winner in my book.

We really liked this recipe! :) It was very simple, not much to it at all.  We will definitely be making this one again! We made 2 changes to the recipe. 1) We used penne noodles instead of elbow since we had penne on hand. I think it could work with any noodles. 2) We did not use mushrooms. :)

Sounds easy, but I would use Italian sausage and pepperoni.  I don't care for Hamburg on pizza.

It was pretty good nothing amazing. It was just a little bland. I did what others suggested and excluded the mushroom and added pepperoni with sprinkled romano cheese on top which helped.

My kids did not identify this with pizza - they kept saying it was just another pasta casserole. 

I'd make it again - but would definitely add in things like pepperoni, olives, etc.

So I modified the recipe slightly. I HATE mushrooms so I immediately pulled that. I put half the mix in the dish, covered in mozzarella, added the rest of the mix, and covered with the rest of the mozzarella. Then I put slices of pepperoni and gouda on the top. Turned out amazing!

My 8yr old helped me make this, so it's even kid friendly to help make. We added olives to ours, cause my son loves olives on his "pizza". My family loved it!

No changes at this time. I like to make the recipe as written the first time so if needed can make changes or not.  Great recipe to start changes would be to give it more pizza flavor.

I made this for my son when he was a little boy and he loved it.  Now he is a senior in high school and when I asked what he wanted to eat for NYE he said pizza casserole...  I did make it a more "grown up" version by using turkey Italian sausage instead of the ground beef and I also added peppers, onion, fresh mushroom and pepperoni.    This is such an easy recipe to customize.

This was easy to make and my one year old LOVED it. I’ve been looking for good recipes for him and this is one I will keep. I LOVE how you can add different ingredients to it such as bacon, pepperoni or peppers and it’ll still taste great!

Excellent meal!! I made it exactly as written, minus the mushrooms. My three sons LOVED it and said I need to make it again! Next time I will add italian sausage to the ground beef. It would be really good with some pepperoni added as well. Use your imagination and think of additions the way you would if you were adding toppings to a pizza--black olives, peppers, etc!! YUM!!

Loved it! Added @ 4 ounces of chopped turkey pepperoni with the hamburger + a small bell pepper + a few sprinkles of dry Italian seasonings and shot of garlic powder for adult tastes. Excellent simple recipe.

I used my own homemade marinara sauce instead of pizza sauce and used a jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce Chunky Sauteed Onions and Garlic flavor. I also used Ditalini pasta from Kroger.

Really good, I loved it as well as my kids.  I had to use tomato paste because I didn't have tomato sauce (bad memory of my pantry), but that worked great!  I added more cheese as well.  Will make it again!

I made this tonight, with a few changes.  I didn't have mushrooms, but when I cooked the ground beef, I added chopped onions and green peppers.  I used up some pizza sauce that I was tired of seeing in my pantry, and used an entire can (15 oz.) of tomato sauce as I didn't want it leftover and having to find a way to use it.  My son and I like a little more seasoning, so I sprinkled some crushed red pepper seasoning over it.   I think this may be one of those recipes that taste better after sitting for day or so.  I think the addition of the entire can of tomato sauce was actually a good call, as it seems it would have been too dry with only 4 oz.  It was just the right amount of sauciness with it.

Made this last night. Excluded the mushrooms and added a little chopped onion and garlic. Delish! My 6 year old son continually commented during dinner, "Why is this so good?" Great dinner for a weeknight!! Served with green beans.

My granddaughter gave this recipe "4 thumbs up" - her highest rating.  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, added about 1/4# sliced pepperoni, quartered, and about 1/2 cup sliced black olives.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms when browning the sausage, instead of using canned mushrooms.  Her only suggestion was to use less cheese next time and maybe a few more black olives.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I liked it.  It was really easy to make.  It was pretty tasty, although I left out the mushrooms since no one in my family likes them.  The casserole should appeal to a wide range of tastes.  It would be easy to jazz it up or add some zip to it if you wanted.

I made it the way it said, minus the mushrooms. It was very easy and tasted like a baked spaghetti. I enjoyed it. It was quick and easy to make after working all day.

The macoroni and pizza/tomato paste give this recipe a great base to work with many possibilities with this. My family likes supream pizza so instead of hamburger I used sausage and pepperoni bites, added green pepper, onion, blk olives, mushrooms, and used pizza cheese blend. Everyone loved it!

Well, I don't know too many kids whose favorite topping is mushroom, so I had to improvise. Cut the ground beef to 1/2 lb., add 1/4 lb. of sweet italian sausage, then add any other "pizza topping" ingredients to individual children's taste. Add one six (6) ounce can of tomato sauce plus a can (6oz) water. Also, use whichever pasta your kids like. Personal favorites are usually "spirals" or "wagon wheels." Or, mix them up and turn it into a cavatini--three pastas, three meats (to beef and sausage, I added pepperoni--most kids' favorite), and three cheeses. As with above "pizza toppings," vegetables (except for mushrooms, lol) can be added as desired.

Very good recipe, but  I totally agree with Irene...after all, what's the use of rating a recipe that has been changed, altered, etc I have been talking to myself(grumbling) about this habit for a long time. Thanks Irene.

Do not habituate children to this stuff.  This, from a guy who just bought Ravioli in a can for the  second, ok third time.
I not only learned my lesson (& cheese complicates) ... now think I should tell some others what to do about it.   Behold!

Both of my kids loved this.  Son went back for 2nds and my daughter went back for 3rds.  A definite hit in my house and easy to make.  
I used 1 lb of ground Bison  and 2 tbsp of tomato paste with 4 oz of water in place of tomato sauce, as its what I had. Served with a side of steamed broccoli - a complete & easy meal.

I loved this!  I doctored the pizza sauce a bit, because the brand I bought tasted a little bland, but this pizza bake was awesome.  I live alone, so this fed me for several meals - super economical! - and I actually looked forward to digging into the leftovers.

I added turkey pepperoni, an undrained can of diced tomatoes green peppers, and onions. I only had 8oz of pizza sauce but it came out good since I used the can of diced tomatoes. I should have cut up all the mushrooms into little pieces. My 7 yr old ate them up until there was a big one and she realized she was eating mushrooms.

When I was a kid, we started making this recipe.  It's billed FOR KIDS so yes it's mild and simple.  I loved it.  Now as an adult I make it differently, but with the appropriate tweaks for your kids' tastes, this one is a likely winner.
