Awesome Irish potatoes!   This recipe is just like the ones I remember getting from a bakery in Pennsylvania (Philly area).  I actually made a bunch for a party and used amounts the recipe says to use for 120 servings.  It sounds like alot but it definitely didn't make 120 balls.    I used 1 cup less of confectioners sugar because of the reviews here saying the recipe was too sweet.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the recipe.   One tip is to not use a lot of cinnamon in the bag.  Only put maybe 1-2 Tablespoons in the bag and place about 6 or 8 balls in it and shake.  When I placed all of the recommended cinnamon in the bag the potatoes had too much on them and tasted awful, a mouthful of cinnamon.  ick.    One other tip is to have one hand slightly wet with water---when rolling this keeps the balls moist and allows them to roll up nicely.   Great recipe overall!!

These are wonderfully easy to to make and taste great! My 5 year old made these all by herself with great ease... it was so much fun to shake the candy in the bag.  And these fix up in just minutes.  The taste is very sweet - but very good all the same.  This recipe is ideal for kids.  On note: the recipe says it makes 24 potatoes - yes, if you want teeny sized ones.  You can easily make larger potatoes if you like - I would say 12 larger size poatoes would be more like it.

I made this with my students, scaling back the ingredients to 1/4 cup of p.s. and coconut and 1 1/2 tsp. of cream.  We made it in plastic sandwich bags.  It turned out great and tasted great too!

I had to bring in a sample of an Irish food for a school project. Each of the kids in my class got one (they liked not having to share) - they were a hit!

This recipe was easiest candy recipe I ever made.  Be sure to use high quality cinnimon.  Cheap cinnimon can taste tart.

Splendid recipe! These irish potatoes taste just like the ones that I remember from childhood. I introduced a few people to them and they've been after me for more because they enjoyed them so much. What a treat!

Great recipe! I made these last second for some St. Patty's giggles, and fed them to two guys who don't normally like coconut.  They loved 'em.  They never really firmed up, but I was told that's part of their charm.

This is a really fun and easy recipe! I read the reviews and was careful to use unsweetened shredded coconut, so the potatoes didn't come out too sweet. I used a very heaping cup of coconut and a scant cup of powdered sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. The consistentcy came out just perfect, like moldable clay. I found that pressing the balls of coconut mixture in the palms of my hands warmed them and made them more smooth and realistic looking. A plastic snack bag made it easy to coat three or four potatoes at a time with the cinnamon. They really look like little potatoes! And they taste like yummy coconut macaroons. I'm adding a photo of my happy results. Five stars for fun, easy, delicious and no baking.

Do not use a fresh coconut! I used this recipe with fresh shredded coconut. I carefully measured 1 cup of coconut, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cream. I ended up with a creamy mess that was too wet to form into balls. I tried to add the cinnamon, hoping it would bind the mixture. Instead, I have a cup of wet brown shredded coconut mix, and can't figure out how to dry it out. Perhaps store-bought shredded coconut is denser and will absorb the cream.

I loved that these were ready to eat in two minutes.  The downside for me were that they were too sweet.  That said, my head is swimming with a ton of variations.  I did not have cream so I used half & half which worked fine to hold everything together.  I would make these again but not use sweetened coconut (which is what I had on hand).  I could also see rolling them in melted chocolate/cocoa (to make coconut bon bons) or nuts.

Good texture and flavor. I read the other reviews and I can understand why some of the reviewers thought they were too sweet or it was too much cinnamon. I might cut back on the cinnamon next time, but overall I thought they tasted very good.

I added an extra tablespoon of cream for binding, and these turned our really well.  They taste even better chilled, and the combination of the cinnimon with the sweet center almost reminds me of rice pudding.  I will definitely be making them again, especially since I got rave reviews from my husband who is not even a coconut fan.  These woudl also be great to make with kids since the dough can be made so quickly and they can make the individual candies themselves.

Easy and yummy.  Not as sweet as one would expect.  The cinnamon takes away some of the sweetness.

This recipe truely upholds what a Philadelphia Irish Potato is suppose to be! The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla extract, but besides that this recipe was GREAT!! Exactly how I remembered them tasting when I had them many years ago when I was young.

These are delightful little treats for people of  all ages to enjoy.  I had a lot of fun shaping and coating the 'potatoes'--although, some people might like to cut in half powdered sugar and half cinnamon for the coating, I personally enjoyed the strong flavor.

very good, but a caution- it is quite sweet (as can be seen by the ingredients). although it was not as sweet as i had expected, they turned out to be pleasently balanced in flavour :D

These were good, and very easy. Just be sure to measure everything right. I had a little too muc cream and a little too much cinnamon, and they ame out very strong. Next time I will try them filled with toasted almonds or pecans.

I made these for a st patrick's day potluck. I doubled the recipe, and added cocoa to the cinnamon. They came out well, although not especially potato-like. I guess you have to use your imagination. I did not like them, but most of the people did. They were very fast and easy but too sweet for me. I won't make again, but i bet others will.

These were just ok. Overly sweet, and too much cinnamon. Perhaps I'll try using unsweetened coconut next time.

Make sure to put the sugar on second.  Easier to stir with your hands.  I doubled the recipe and used about the same amount of cinnamon.  Might work well with cinnamon sugar mix, since I work with pretty strong cinnamon.  I ended up rolling them instead of shaking them around in a bag, and they turned out great.

Very easy to make. Were a hit at family reunion. Very sweet. Added a bit more cream to help bind. The kids loved helping me roll into cinnamon. Great for letting the kids help. very good also.

Not the Irish potato candy recipe that we have always been used to. We use cream cheese.

Super easy recipe and you really can't tell that you are missing any ingredients.  Yes, they are super sweet...but that is just how they are supposed to be.

If you like VERY sweet, then this is the recipe for you.  I like sweet, rich goodies, but this was too much for me.  We got also got too much cinnamon on them when shaking them in the bag.

Mine turned out a little sticky and hard to roll into balls, but firmed up in the fridge pretty nicely. Maybe next time I'll refrigerate the coconut/sugar/milk mixture (I used milk instead of cream, and it was fine) before rolling. Delicious though - we gobbled up the whole plate.

Cimmamon-coconut-sugar...OH MY!  I was looking for a quick, easy recipe for a St. Patrick's Day desert, but couldn't imagine that these could be any good.  So few ingredients!  Boy, was I wrong! I only made a half-batch at first, but then I made a full batch when I realized how great they were.  I did use only about a teaspoon of cinnamon in my shaking bag, and it was plenty.

I am typically not a big coconut candy person (more due to the texture than the flavor), but I thought I'd give these a try prior to a trip to Ireland. Texture issues aside, I thought these were just too sweet. Maybe i shouldn't have used sweetened coconut, but the recipe doesn't specify. I also ended up needing to double the cream in order to generate the proper consistency. They really do look like little potatoes, though, so they'd be good for a whimsical person with a big sweet tooth.

I've tried to make other Irish Potatoes and almost tossed them out the window! This one was easy and delish!

PS...you can add a little more heavy cream IF you think it is needed.

These were so easy to make and a perfect St. Pat's dessert, especially for my nieces and nephews who are on gluten-free diets.  Like many, I cut the sugar in half the second time I made it and it was still good and sweet.  The family couldn't get enough of these!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Key: Unsweetened shredded C and to release excess cinnamon, I had a small plate on a little incline and gently 'dropped' the potatoes at the high side, they rolled down and shed the cinnamon coat.  I rated this down 1 star because cinnamon straight is such a  strong element.  It needs to be cut (maybe) with some of the powdered sugar?
