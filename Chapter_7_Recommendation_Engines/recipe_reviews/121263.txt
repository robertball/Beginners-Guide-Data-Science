I am basing this 5 star rating upon the changes that I made to the recipe. I used 1/2 cup of real onion and sauteed that in 3 tbs. of real butter. I added that to 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 16 oz. of sour cream. I greased the pan and put the hash browns into the pan, put 1 pkg. (2 cups of cheddar cheese,shredded) on top of those potatoes, and then put soup/sour cream mixture on that. I then used 4 cups of corn flakes (crushed) mixed with 1/2 cup of real butter melted and put over all. Then I baked it at 350 Degrees for one hour. We really enjoyed this recipe, and will definitely make again many more times!!

This recipe is my husband's favorite! It is pretty much the same as my mother in-law's "funeral potatoes". Except that we grate 8 real potatoes & saute` the onions. Personally, I also use half the butter & combine it with extra virgin olive oil. 
I like the comment left with layering suggestions, and will try that too.

I have been making this dish for past 5 yrs from a Taste of Home magazine.  Everyone loves it, especially with ham! The sauce has a wonderful rich flavor...I'm a fan of sour cream. The potatoes are not floating in sauce, so make extra if you like yours on the creamy side. I cut down on the butter and occasionally skip on making the topping with equally good results. TIP - Make sure your potatoes are completely thawed and bake for the full hour or your potatoes will not cook thoroughly.

We loved this recipe! I used cheese it crackers instead of cornflakes (Thats all I had on hand) and i added french fried Onins to the cheese it topping as well. I think I will keep the changes I made next time. I can't imagine this dish without the cheesey cracker addition!

Very good. I only used  about 7 tablespoons of butter total. Also put fried onions on the top.

I made this for my family for Christmas and they all loved it.  It was so easy with the Southern style hashbrowns.

How can you go wrong with these ingredients.  I made as written except I had to use real onions as I ran out of the dried ones.  I diced them very small and they were fine.  I also had no cornflakes so used some French's Fried onion topping.  Yum.

I capitalized a bit on BOBOBEARZOE's review - in addition to the shredded cheddar cheese, I added a package of shredded parmesan. I'll definitely be making this again!

I'm basing my rating on making the recipe exactly as-is with no changes. The potatoes never really got soft, it was greasy but dry (no suace!), and had an artifical taste.  I'm glad I made it the day before my event so I can replace it with a different recipe.
