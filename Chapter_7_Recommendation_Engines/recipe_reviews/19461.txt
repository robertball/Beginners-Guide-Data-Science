I made this for a get together last night.  The pudding had good flavor, but never completely firmed up, and therefore, the pie did not hold its shape after cutting.  Even today, after well over 24 hours of refrigeration, it is still very loose.  I DID cook the pudding properly (I grew up making cooked pudding -- my mother hated instant).  Perhaps it was the cocktail juice that prevented it from firming -- however, I did not even add the full cup because I didn't get that much out of my can.  Mine did not look like the picture, either.  All the fruit sunk to the bottom.  Also, I did add sugar to the whipped cream (I never made it without sugar before and did not like the flavor when I tasted it, so I added some) and used quite a bit of it on each piece of pie to try to cover up its sloppy appearance.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe ...
Tastes just like what it is, Fruit Cocktail with Instant Vanilla Pudding, just sort of bland in my book

I think that this is really really good. Very fun to make. I always like opening cans, so this is pie is the recipe for me. A big hit with the whole family.
