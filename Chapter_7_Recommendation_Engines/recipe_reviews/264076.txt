Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I did use a bag of pre-shredded cabbage (coleslaw mix) so it had a few carrots in it but that only added to the finished dish. The cabbage had a nice brown on it and was super buttery but I prefer it a little crispier. Easy fix. Next time I'll just reduce the cook time.
