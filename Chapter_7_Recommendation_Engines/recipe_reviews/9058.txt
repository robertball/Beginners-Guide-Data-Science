This was great! I would never have thought these ingredients would taste this way. I am a novice at mexican-inspired cooking, but this chicken tasted exactly like a friend's homemade chicken enchiladas-yum! i too decreased the mustard to about 1/8 cup in the marinade-- and added more (about double) of all ingredients to sauce while boiling it, and we STILL didn't have enough sauce for our 3 chicken breasts. next time i will make even more sauce, it was really the star of the whole meal. I used a medium salsa and it had just the right amount of heat. Topped with sour cream, which was just perfect to counter the heat-- no lime garnish, they had all been squeezed into the sauce by that point. served with yellow rice and a black bean and corn salad. great, easy recipe! thanks!

The whole family loved this!  My kids even asked for seconds...Only change I made was using olive oil for 1/2 the butter and topping with sour cream instead of yogurt.  This one's a keeper!

Quick and easy, but if I ever make this again, I will double the recipe for the marinade.  There was not enough left to serve over the cooked chicken.  What was left was really tasty.

I made this again with a few changes and it really came out well - we all loved it.  In the marinade I used 1 TBSP of mustard instead of 1/4 cup and since my little girl was going to be trying it, I used Pace Extra Mild Chunky Picante Sauce.  Then I marinated 3 chicken breasts in the frig for about 4 hours. I cooked the chicken with the marinade right in the frying pan and I used olive oil instead of butter.  Finally, I added chicken broth as needed during the cooking time and it came out deliciously moist.  Definitely a keeper!

I loved the flavors in this marinade.  I definitely agree with previous reviewers on two points: the recipe just doesn't make enough marinade, and use less dijon.
Here's what I did: I marinated the chicken according to the recipe.  Then, instead of following all the complications of boiling the marinade, etc, I simply mixed up more marinade, warmed it in a separate pan from the chicken, and poured it one top of the chicken before serving.
I also used sour cream instead of yogurt, and LOVED it!  My husband and I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers.  Goes GREAT with Mexican Rice III from this site.

This was very good, I did make a few adjustments. Increased the lime a bit, topped with sour cream, and the best addition, added tequila to the marinade. Gives it a more authentic Mexican flair, plus I love tequila! Oh yeah, also used a smoother salsa

Way too much mustard. Mustard in most dishes should be like a first kiss. A bit on the light side. It should enhance not be the main taste. Pairing dijon mustard with salsa is odd. Something like an onion mustard would be better. And use only about 1 tablespoon instead of a 1/4 of cup. That is alot of mustard.
Yogurt doesn't really go with this recipe. Yogurt is usually used to tame the hit in a dish such as a spicy curry, so it would tame the heat of a spicy salsa, but use a good Mexican sour cream instead.

After reviewing the recipe and the other reviews I added some extra salsa (mild) & lime juice while cutting back a little on the mustard (I used Grey Poupon - but of course !)- served it over spicy yellow rice and it was a big hit. I even forgot the yogurt in the mad rush of trying to get the kids to the table - I'll try it next time. Thanks

This is really good.  The marinade makes the chicken really tender (I marinaded it all day and cooked it when I got off work).  It also was easy to scale down to one serving, which is great because I cook for myself a lot.  The key to scaling it down is to add water to the skillet every once and a while as it is cooking so the sauce does not burn off.

Thought this was fantastic!  However, much prefer sour cream to the yogurt for topping.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe! I started by just following the suggestions of other users and making double the amount of sauce, but now I quadruple it! It's just that good. I usually serve it over rice and so I like a little extra to pour over.   This time I made it a little different (not because it needed amending, but just because I was bored). I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and and made extra sauce, I also added some bite size pieces of red and yellow peppers. Instead of topping with yogurt I made some homemade guacamole and plopped a scoop on top. It was amazing!  My boyfriend even made some margaritas, and the whole evening was a hit! We loved it! I don't suggest changing the recipe because it's bad, only if you're looking for something similar but more interesting. YUM!

This is my favorite recipe on this website.  It is totally delicious and easy to make.  I now don't bother to marinade - I brown the chicken, stick it in a casserole dish, add the sauce and bake at 350 til done (about 1/2 hour or so).  Here's what make's it extra-good:  add the yoghourt to the cooking sauce instead of as a garnish at the end.  Also nice to add almost-cooked new potatoes to the casserole about 15 minutes before the chicken is done.

I wish I had read the reviews before preparing this dish, as the previous reviewers were correct in scaling down the Dijon.  I added some sautéed mushrooms and onions to the sauce.  I also substituted sour cream for the yogurt. Overall it was good, but will modify it in the future.

I made this recipe using legs and thighs with the intentions of leftovers. Well, it was so good we ate it all the first night. I doubled the marinade like the comments suggested and it was a perfect amount.

Great recipe, I love the blend of flavors. I throw the salsa, mustard and lime juice in a zip-loc bag and leave in the fridge while I'm at work so this is ready to cook when I get home. I've never topped with the yogurt and I don't think it needed it.

I doubled the recipe, but used the original amount of Dijon mustard. Even then, the mustard was a bit strong... I chopped up the chicken and served it fajita-style with Mexican rice and refried beans. Bachelor friendly

Easy and very tasty, though I think I overdid it on cutting back the mustard and increasing the lime!  I cut the mustard in half while doubling the lime, and it was very tart, but still good.  Next time I will still cut the mustard back to 1/2 because my husband is not a mustard fan, and will increase the lime by just 1/2 instead of doubling it.  Works SO MUCH better if you use chicken tenders or pound your chicken breast flat before cooking.  This way you don't have to cook it as long and the sauce doesn't overthicken and burn.  Served with spanish rice and green bean casserole to make it a kid pleaser.  Will definitely make it again.

Rated "best ever chicken recipe" by my husband!  I followed previous reviewers' advice: I doubled the salsa and lime, used wholegrain mustard and marinaded 24 hrs.  I served the chicken on saffron rice mixed with red bell pepper, peas and corn and topped with lite sour cream, shredded sharp cheese and chopped fresh cilantro; avocado slices with a little lime juice on the side.

We did not like this at all.  It either had to much mustard or just something with to much vinegar.

This was wonderful!! I used Pico DiGalo along with the medium chunky salsa, it gives it more texture (also kids dont know that they are eating so many vegetables). I also squeezed another lime on the chicken just after it was cooked. I made a bed of lettuce, placed a chicken breast on top, spooned the sauce over the top. For a nice presentation I added some shredded chddar and a dollop of sour cream with cilantro and a couple lime segments to top it off. Was beautiful and the guests raved. Even without the extra toppings it tastes great. Leftovers? I had that once and was great the next day. I make this often, its so easy and also Diabetic friendly and carbohydrate friendly.

This was so good it's now in my permanent collection! It was incredibly easy to make (1 lime equals one tablespoon of lime juice) and enjoyed by everyone at the dinner party. I made it with dark meat and white meat instead of all breasts. Also, there wasn't really enough marinade remaining to make the glaze. I served it with the yogurt and crushed pineapple -- my guests said that the pineapple gave it just the right amount of tartness. A real winner!

I didn't have any lime juice, so I added orange juice instead. I didn't use the yogurt or lime segments either. I have made it 3 times and don't measure anything anymore.  I like extra "sauce" and just add what I think is right.  I'm surprised I even tried this recipe because I'm not a big salsa fan and don't like mustard, but it was fabulous!  I recommended it to my sister who was having her ex mother-in-law and family over and wanted to serve something special. (She took my word  for it!) This meal was a HUGE hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe and even her 5 year old grandson loved it, saying it was the best chicken he ever ate!

Cooked as written with 2 notes. It was very good. I really thought it would be too mustardey but cooking properly you really cant tell the flavor is mustard. Not too tangy not too bland, right in the middle. First note- I cut the breasts length wise to make them thinner.   Second note- about not enough liquid. I browned the chicken in the butter then I removed chicken deglazed the pan with 1/4c water added the remaining marinade and additional 3/4 c water stirred well then put the chicken back in and simmered for 8min. The sauce was brown like a chipoltle sauce. We used yogurt which was good, since I also had Mexican Crema I tried that and it was good too  but added more fat. I served it with Target brand lime cilantro rice.

This was awesome! I used picante sauce instead of salsa, as the name suggests and it was great. I read here that several reviewers thought that the dijon was overpowering, but I made it as written and we loved it. I am not even a big dijon fan. Thanks for the great, healthy recipe!

Great! However I would suggest a few things - like others have to double the serving of sauce and use sour cream vs. plain yogurt. Also cut the mustard to 1 tablespoon, otherwise it's a bit much. Other than that though everyone loved it! Made it for a mother's day dish and had the whole family raving about it!

This is a wonderful dish!!!  I marinated the chicken for about 3 hrs then sauteed the chicken as written.  I threw out the marinade & added approximately 1 cup of medium salsa to the pan.  I then cooked it for about 5 more minutes, til chix was done.  I spooned sauce from the skillet over each breast, topped them with a dollop of sour cream & crushed taco chips.  It was wonderful.   I did cut the dijon mustard to 1 tble after reading the reviews.  Hubby enjoyed it much!!!    Thanks

I made this for seven firefighters - They really enjoyed the mix of flavors.  I added a little chopped cilantro, diced green chilis and chopped Anaheim Peppers to the marinade and served the chicken with spanish rice and black beans.  I had chopped onions, Chopped Anaheim Peppers, chopped cilantro, sliced tomatoes, diced green chilis and shredded cheese on the side. Yum!

This is a winner!    The original recipe left us with some big questions like "What kind of salsa?"  When I went to the grocery store I wondered about many possible choices:  mild, medium (they had no "hot"), mango?  I'll bet any of the fresh salsas in your market would work but would make this an entirely different dish.  The medium-hot salsa proved to be too tame for our tastes.  I first added a bit of LA hot sauce, but it was still kinda' bland.     'Corrected that with a few dashes of habanera extract.  Also, don't forget to salt it lightly.  There are only two of us at home now, but I (the "hubbie") usually make a recipe for 4 or 6, and we use the excess for other meals.    This morning I sauteed one of the leftover picante chicken breasts with two coarsely diced fresh tomatoes from our garden.  Delicious, healthy, and compatible with our diet if the caloric estimate for one serving is correct.  As I said at the beginning, "this is a winner!"  IMHO.  Don't just copy it.  Modify this recipe to suit your tastes and clean out your refrigerator.  P.S.  In looking at the other ratings, you either love this or you hate it.

This was good, but I think I might enjoy it better on the grill next time.  I doubled the sauce as some other reviewers recommended.  I cubed the chicken up and served it with corn and rice.  Tasty sauce.

I took some liberties with the measurements in this recipe, but the end results were delicious. I added a little less mustard than what it called for, left out the yogurt and sliced the chicken into strips before I sauted them. They turned out moist and tender and completely delicious. Thanks for a super recipe.

This recipe was just ok.  I used half dijon mustard and half wholegrain because that's what I had in the house.  The only bad part about this recipe is that the sauce looks an awful lot like vomit!  If you can get past that and eat it, the taste is nice.

This recipe was just OK; not sure if I'd make it again with some adjustments or not.  It was rather a disappointment as we both like lime and anything picante.  The flavours didn't just didn't mellow together well.

this was an excellent and absurdly easy dish.  i mixed in a bit of yoghurt with the sauce while cooking, and used medium salsa and a spicier mustard to add a little kick.  i also recommend cooking up some veggies with the sauce and serving over rice.

The sauce is very sharp as the recipe says.  It's an unusual combination of ingredients that make up the sauce.  I thought it was pretty good, but not great.  There are a lot of other recipes I would rather repeat than have this, probably.

Very tender and tasty.  I have made this twice recently.  It has gone over quite well - even with my 8 year old daughter.  I serve it with home made quacamole - I love the chicken with it.  I make an extra batch of the marinade to pour over the cooked chicken.

This was really tasty.  I thought the mustard would be overpower the flavor, but it didn't.  Next time I think I will add some fresh cilantro the marinade.

Very tasty.  The mustard makes it different in a good way.  I marinated it for several hours.  After boiling the marinade (and before adding it back to the chicken) I added another 1/2 cup of salsa, 1/8 cup dijon mustard and 1 tablespoon lime juice.  It ended up making just the right amount of marinade with the added ingredients.

Really good spicy flavor.  This has quickly become a favorite.  My husband doesn't think that the extra lime garnish is necessary, but I'm all for lots of lime.  Yum!

This has great flavor. I doubled the sauce the second time I made it and only used 3 chicken breasts. It allowed us to have plenty sauce for the rice. I put more lime juice in than is called for.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. I did double the sauce as was recommended and it was certainly needed.  I was a bit short on the mustard as the jar was low but I still found it much to strong on the mustard side. The sauce has a very bitter taste although it did look very pretty.

Fixed this for dinner - thought the combination of flavors sounded so bizarre it had to be good...and it was!  I actually wisked the yogurt into the sauce before I served it...made it nice and creamy..yum.  A real surprise.

We make this all of the time with bean salad on the side. DELICIOUS! We try to use fresh salsa or the Herdes brand, which is waaaay better than that other stuff with lot's of artificial flavour and preservatives.

This was not good at all.  I reduced the amount of mustard after reading some reviews, but it was still too much.  This was the first recipe from this site that I couldn't even finish.

This was such a great meal I started making it in March and my husband and 5 year old thinks it is great the yogurt idea kind of scared them but were pleasantly surprised at how well it tasted together and then made it for my parents and my Dad is very picking and he loved it too.  A definate winner for my family!

This was so good and simple!  The ingredients seemed weird to me (mustard and salsa) but it turned out wonderful!  I cooked it a little differently, but followed the ingredients.  I didn't add the yogurt at the end either. A definite keeper for when i need a simple meal!

I thought that this had too much mustard.  It overpowered the salsa and really, who wants to eat mustard flavored chicken?  I will probably play with the recipe again because I think that the idea is good, I just was not wild about my inital results.

This was very tasty, moist and tender.  I used the ingredients written except for the yogurt/lime at the end although it would have made a very pretty presentation.  But it was just us for supper so opted against it.  Also, I baked it since my stove isnt in yet.  I can see where you would need to make extra marinade for the end.  But the flavor was really very good.  I marinated in a bag for about 3.5 hours.

After tasting, I agree with another reviewer, you will either love it or hate it.  This has a very strong flavor and is not for mild paletes.  I cooked 1 pound chicken tenders in a wok without butter (the marinated chicken had enough liquid) then added the boiled sauce to the wok along with 3 carmelized onions, some frozen spinach and frozen corn.  (Rice or black beans would also be good in this)  For the sauce i trippled the salsa and lime juice and kept he mustard the same. (I can't imagine using the full amoung of mustard, wayyyy too overpowering) Put a spoonful of greek yogurt on top of each plate, very good.  This is a great way to have chicken and vegetables that is anything but ordinary.  ...Also added a few dashes or chili powder.

Absolutely loved it! I actually was nervous about it but wanted to try a lime flavored chicken recipe - now it is one of my new faves! I used chicken tenders and am looking forward to try it with chicken breasts next time.

Great recipe idea! I didn't have enough salsa as recipe called for and with so many saying you really needed more I improvised. Tossed a can of diced tomatoes, some onion, jalapeno, and some cilintro in the blender for a quick swirl. And I also as suggested put it in a baking dish with a splash of Olive oil and bit of butter and baked till tender with the salsa. Served with Avocado slices and pico de gallo, and sides of Mexican rice and refried beans. Oh my! It was a nice dinner. Don't forget the sour cream!

Perfect flavor! I cut my chicken breasts up into chunks and made a double batch of sauce and baked it all in the oven and it was delicious. Served it with yellow rice and everyone loved it. Thanks for this great recipe!

When i boiled the marinade, it burned/disappeared and I had to make more.  I had to stick this in the oven to get it to cook.  It had a dry, flavorless taste.

I doubled the sauce recipe for only 3 breasts and still didn't have enough.  the flavor of the sauce was really unique and saved us from the "we're having chicken again" feeling. I had some trouble with the sauce causing the chicken to stick to the pan and start to burn but caught it early enough and it wasn't at all noticeable. Really different meal that I look forward to making again.

This was a great combination! I made a couple modifications though. When you arew cooking the chicken add some boullion so that the chicken doesn't dry out. I also used sour cream instead of the yogurt. I paired this dish with the Cilantro-Lime Rice and it was perfect!

Very simple and very good!  The only reason I tried this was because one of the reviews said their children had seconds.  My children are very picky and HATE chicken.  However they love anything with a little mexican flare and loved this!  Thanks for this 5 star recipe!!!

All of my family loved the dish. Even my old Japanese grandmother who is not fond of any kinds of spicy foods liked the chicken. I took some advises and only put 1tsp of Dijion mastard. Add more salsa and used only 3 chicken brests. They were delicious! Thank you.

We really liked this. I halved the chicken (and kept the sauce the same) and used sour cream instead of yogurt. I served with black beans and rice and it's definitely a keeper! I eliminated the butter (used cooking spray) and it's a REALLY healthy recipe!!

Great low calorie dish. I cut my chicken breast into bite size pieces, doubled the marinade but only used half of it to marinade it so I would have enough to make a sauce. I would cut down on the mustard the next time.

It was very good, although be wary of the spice level of the salsa  you use.  We used hot, because we love hot, but mixed with the dijon and it made it too hot.

Easy to prepare, comes together very quickly, but not much to rave about taste-wise.  Really expected lime flavor to be prominent, but it was overpowered by the dijon.

this is a fabulous chicken recipe....the only thing I changed was to use a little more lime juice (I love lime)  If you are not a fan of really spicy food definately stay away from the hot salsa..use medium or mild.  I served this with cuban rice and beans from this site.  Two thumbs up...my latin food loving husband loved it!!!

What a wonderful combination of flavors!
I let the chicken marinate for about 3 hours.  Definitely a repeater in this house. Served it with a cucumber/red pepper salad.

This is excellent and I have made it almost 10 times since I got this recipe. I usually lower the amount of mustard and add more of spicy salsa sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

No complaints about this recipe, eveyone seemed to like it.  The chicken was very tender and tasty.  I wanted less of a mustard flavor so I changed the proportions & used a bit more salsa 3/4 C, and only 2T of Dijon mustard, I also added 2T of brown sugar.

My husband frequently requests this dish. It's really easy and only uses a few ingredients so it's great for a quick meal. We love the sauce, so I usually double the amount and add a bit of chicken broth to smooth it out a bit. Yum!

This was very tasty!  I marinated the chicken breasts for a few hours.  I also skipped making the sauce out of the extra marinade.  I just sauted the chicken and then topped it with some salsa (Chi-Chi's medium is what I used).  My boyfriend and I thought it was delicious!

This was a HUGE hit with my family of 6. Even the normally picky child ate. It was so easy and so good! It's now a new "family favorite".

Easy and pretty good flavor.  I decreased mustard as others suggested.  Added more lime juice and some chili powder, cayenne and minced garlic.  I marinated overnight.  With some fresh cilantro along with the yogurt and lime wedges, almost as good as real fajitas.

I used half of the original recipe when I first made this dish.  There was hardly any source.  Second time, I had heaps of spoons that it calls for.  Better.  I use mild salsa and it tastes good.

Very easy and delicious.  The chicken breasts are fork-tender.  I will definitely make it often.  However, my toddler complained that it is too spicy for him.

Flavor was mediocre.  Chicken was dry.  If you plan to make, I recommend significantly less dijon and a bit more lime and thin slice chicken breast.

Super tasty. Kept the chicken nice and moist. I would suggest doubling the marinade though - didn't end up having enough in the end to pour on top of the chicken.

Had a really nice flavor...I took the advice of ohters and used Sour Cream instead-Yummy ...also I added about a cup more of Picante Sauce to get good coverage over the chicken.

This recipe is fast, easy and healthy!  I would recommend experimenting as with just these ingredients it seemed kind of plain. I didn't have enough salsa so added a bit of ketchup, red wine vinegar, tomatoe paste, tobasco (i like spicy), onion flakes, salt and pepper. Need the salt to balance out the lime! Also, used only 1-2 tbsp. max of mustard, olive oil instead of butter, and cooked it all in the oven, giving it a turn every once and awhile. Was delicious! It's a great base recipe to experiment with as many of the users on here have done, so don't be shy to try! I think fresh chopped up grape tomatoes would definatly add some freshness to this recipe but didn't have any on hand. Next time!

This recipe sounded odd, which is right up my alley!  We were disappointed.  We doubled the marinade as suggested in other reviews and did not end up with enough to saute with at the end - and we only used 4 chicken breasts!  I found it edible but the rest of the family did not.  I *get* the dijon - it has an after taste that seems to go well with the lime - but the initial bite does not flow for me.  The yogurt was a great touch.  All in all, the rest of my family said no more, and even though I ate mine, I won't make it again.  Thanks though.

A little strong on the mustard taste, but really good!  I would double the marinade too.  I made this for a friend that just had a baby and she and her husband were so grateful for this yummy REAL meal!

I gave this four stars, because it didn't taste bad, there was just nothing "wow!" about it.  We have lots of chicken recipes that we like better, so we probably won't make this one again, sorry.

One of the best chicken recipes I've come across in a long time! I did find it would've been better to use smaller chicken breasts. The ones I used were quite large and I would've liked the cooked marinade to go a little bit farther.

This recipe by itself I give 3 stars... but if you mix it with "Mexican Sour Cream Rice" (I found that recipe on here too) and put it all in a wrap with lettuce and black beans and then sprinkle lime on it... YUMMMMMYY - I give that 5 stars for sure!

This recipe is easy, healthy, and unbelievably delicious and flavorful.  What more could you want?  I definitely agree with previous reviewers that you should plan on doubling the recipe for the marinade, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

Just a strange combination of flavors for me.  All my kids ate it, but I subbed honey mustard for dijon because we don't like dijon.  This made it taste like a spanish version of Thousand island dressing......just different.  Probably won't make again.

this recipe was excellent!  After reading the reviews, I also tweeked the recipe abit, adding the tequila (about 1/4 cup) increased the amount of lime juice to 3 tbsp,increasing the salsa to 1 cup and using sour cream.  A definite hit and a definite keeper!  The family keeps asking for this!

This recipe was delicious and simple. I made a very small change, I used a Raspberry Chipotle Salsa and it paired with the Lime juice terrifically. My husband and I cut the chicken up and served them in soft tacos with garnishes. We also used Sour Cream instead of yogurt.

I made several changes to this recipe.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, which essentially doubles the sauce.  I also substituted sour cream for the yogurt.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces as it sauteed and after I had boiled the marinade, I added a little water to it before pouring it in with the chicken becuase it had gotten too thick.  I served the chicken over black beans with a dollop of sour cream.  Very good with these changes.

Very good!  I followed some other posters' suggestions and made 2 batches of the marinade rather than boiling the leftover marinade to make the sauce.  About 2 minutes before the chicken was done cooking, I added some thawed Hanover Brands "Latino Blend" to the pan which consists of black beans, corn, onions, and green chiles.  It was a wonderful one pan meal!

This was delicious!  We doubled the sauce, which worked out well.  We kept the amount of dijon that the recipe said to use, but used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I would eat this again and again!

I used spicy golden mustard and added fresh mushrooms halfway through the chicken-cook time and it was wonderful!!  My v articulate husband's exact words were, "That was good.  I mean good, good."  SUCCESS!!  Thank you!

Wonderful moist chicken, 0 after marinating this for 30 minutes pored everything into a 9X13 clay baking dish and cooked it in the oven @ 350.  I added 1/2 cup chopped onion and I added extra of all the other ingredients as I had 4 large chicken breasts.  Will try this with spicy salsa next time would be great in a wrap, we had it with Caesar Salad

This recipe was wonderful! The Dijon mustard/salsa combo was excellent! The marinade should definitely be doubled though. It was a great twist on chicken, and so easy!

It was pretty good.  We doubled everything for the marinade except for the mustard and my fiance still found it to be too mustardy.  If we made it again, we would probably use a quarter of the recommended amount of mustard.

I gave this recipe four stars. For the salsa, I used Fresh California Salsa from this website. I feel that it really improved  the flavors. d I really don't think that the recipe would have been as good if I didn't make the fresh salsa. Just make sure you add enough mustard, it really makes it more creamy. This is a wonderful, yet healthful, recipe.

This was pretty mustard-y.  I would decrease the mustard and increase the lime and salsa.  Otherwise, it was tasty and easy.

I would give this 3.5 stars. It was ok, but nothing outstanding. I wouldn't mind trying it again, but with shredded chicken, and use it with the salsa sauce in tortillas. I may give it a whirl, but probably not. Thanks anyway.

Very tasty. I used a non stick pan so there was no need for the butter. I also pounded the chicken flat and let it marinate for several hours. The dollop of plain yogurt was really tasty on top with the sauce. Fast meal.

We really liked this recipe.  I scaled it down to just 3 serving but kept the same amount of marinade.  Next time, I may even increase that amount because the marinade is so good!  I took someone's suggestion and served with Cuban rice and beans but next time will probably serve over white rice.

This is a VERY popular recipe at my house.  We double the sauce because we love it so much.  Highly recommended for people of all palates - despite being centered on picante and mustard it doesn't taste much like either.  You'll love this tangy treatment that requires only common ingredients.

easy, easy....I doubled the sauce tho.  Nice mix of flavours but I think next time I will add a little kick.  Maybe cayenne or tobasco as we didn't find it spicy at all.  I did use mild salsa, next time I might use med instead.  Nice/quick recipe for mid-week dinner.  A bit sloppy for company tho.  I paired it with Mexican Rice and a veggie dish.  I will make again

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  What makes it a 5 for me is that it was quite easy and healthy too!  I did make some changes.  I halved the amount of mustard called for, and doubled the amount of lime and salsa.  I could still taste a hint of the mustard, but it wasn't too overpowering as some earlier reviews had suggested.  I also only made three chicken breasts, and towards the end it appeared there wasn't going to be enough sauce left over, so I added a little more of every ingredient.  There still was barely enough sauce!  Also served with sour cream instead of yogurt.

I was a little doubtful about this marinade, but it was great! I have a hard time finding healthy dinner recipes for my boyfriend and I but we both loved this one. I did add some extra hot sauce to the marinade to give it a little extra kick.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make with what I happened to have in the house!  Like other reviewers, I too found the need to double up on the sauce.
The sauce was a bit too sharp for me (I used a mild Dijon and a medium salsa), so I added sour cream directly to the sauce to soften the flavour  just before serving over the chicken and a bed of
egg noodles.  Will try the yogurt next time! (and there will be many, many next times :)  A scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert was pure heaven to cool the mouth down!

Great recipe!  Very tasty and easy to make.  Like a lot of the other reviewers, I have to say that this recipe *must* be doubled...or else you'll have cranky people asking for more sauce!  :)  After doubling the recipe, I had just enough left over to put on top of the rice.  Yum!

This was tasty. I only cooked two chicken breasts, and used half the amount of sauce called for, but I think it needed more sauce. Most of the juices dried out during cooking so I added some water. I'd make it again with those adjustments.

I added some chili powder to it and cooked it on the grill. It was delicious. Icooked it  the first time like the recipe called for and it was also very good. My favorite is just cooking on the grill for anything.

This recipe was much better than I expected!  I used mild salsa, because it's what I had, and then used crushed red pepper and cayenne to heat it up a bit. I also served it with sour cream instead of the yogurt and it was wonderful.  So so so tender!

I loved this chicken!  It was easy to make, fast, and tasted wonderful.  My little boy is 16 months so I didn't try it on him - I was worried about it being too spicy since I used pretty warm salsa.  Great recipe that I will use often.

Just make this for dinner already!
It's sooo good. I listened to the fellow reviewers and altered the recipe a tad: 
Dijon mustard 1.5Tbsp, Salsa 1 C, lime juice 1\4 C.
I read a few that subbed the dijon for a different mustard, I loved the dijon hint. Adds some nice complexity and sweetness  to the flavors
I can also see why some people don't add the sour cream (I didn't have yogurt)  it's true it doesn't "need" it- but you won't regret it! It's once again an added tartness and extra creaminess to the flavors. Add the cream if you don't want leftovers lol!
I served it with veggies. It doesn't matter, you won't notice side dishes with this meal.
I'm not a huge meat/chicken fan and I really don't go for seconds of it. I did with this!!!

I have made this twice now. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe states. I did marinate it for about 6 hours vs the 30 minutes suggested. I have to agree with other post...way too much mustard for our liking.... and we like mustard. Also there wasn’t enough sauce for the amount of chicken. Tonight, I made it again and this time I used 2 cups of mild salsa, 1/4 cup of Dijon and 6 Tblsp of lime juice. Again I marinated it all day and prepared as suggested. We all loved this version. Served with Mexican rice, a sprinkle of Monterrey Jack and a  small amount of sour cream (we prefer this to yogurt). this dish will be added to my monthly menu!

I definitely liked this recipe because it gives you another option to making an interesting chicken dish.  I omitted the yogurt at the end and replaced it with sour cream due to personal preference.  My family enjoyed this dish and I would make this again.  Was easy enough to make, but did require a watchful eye on the sauce.

I rated this 5 star even though after reading the reviews I did reduce the amount of Grey Poupon I used to 1/4 c, so I did alter the recipe.  However..I really did enjoy the flavor and will make this again.  It is so easy and very good with a rice side dish.

This was very good.  I used my own homemade salsa and it was very tasty.  I didn't use the yogurt, I just added more salsa marinade on top of the cooked chicken breast.  It was grilled in my NuWave.  I use my NuWave for all our cooking.

I halved this recipe for the two of us, but I used a leg and thigh for my husband's share. We really liked the flavor in both the dark meat and the white meat. However, we didn't even bother with the yogurt and lime as the condiments to serve with the chicken. My only complaint is that there was not sauce to top it off! Should have read the reviews first!  I made chicken salad with the rest of the breast I didn't eat.  It was good!!!

Actually I doubled the marinade as others suggested, cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, added black beans, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, salt and pepper, then baked everything together at 350 for @ 30 minutes. Added four cheese Mexican blend on top after plying it out if the oven. Topped with Chopped up kalamata olives and pepperoncini peppers and served with sour cream, salsa and leftover tortillas that I cut into triangles and heated till they were crispy!! Served as an appetizer!

I thought this sounded really good but was disappointed overall.  The sauce with the salsa and mustard was kind of gross looking and tasted just ok. Not one I will repeat.

I liked the pizazz of the taste, but I think it would be better with less lime juice.  Otherwise, a very good recipe with a lot going for it!  Thanks.

Sorry, Donna....I didn't like this recipe much.  I appreciated the ease of preparation, and it did have a nice presentation, but I didn't particularly like the taste of salsa with the dijon-mustard.

I doubled the sause ingredience and only cooked 4 chicken breast.  I marinaded overnight and the chicken was extra tender.  I served it to my guests with brown rice sauteed with mushrooms and green onions in olive oil and it was a hit.

Not a hit at my house.  Way too much mustard for my family - and I have two that really like mustard.  It was fine for a one time meal, but I won't make it again.  If you are going to make it I would suggest you double the sauce portion - there wasn't quite enough for 6 chicken breasts.  And there was hardly any sauce to use on top.

I use mild salsa and sour cream with this and it's wonderful with rice.  I too double the sauce portions.  My kids like it with the mild salsa.  If it was just for me, I'd use a medium or hot.

The taste was wonderful!  I really liked it with sour cream instead of yogurt.  My chicken breasts were fairly thick so the browning process took much longer and my butter burned. Next time I'll pound the chicken down to make them thinner and easier to brown.  Didn't give it to my kids, it's not something they would eat.  Great recipe!

I served for company on Saturday night -- both my guests 
and my husband loved it. I was VERY easy and tremendously
tasty. It was a great meal to make on a very hot weekend,
I put it together to marinate and then hit the pool for a while;
started cooking it when the guests arrived and everything was timed
perfectly. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and served it on top of 
rice with a salad on the side. I'll make this againand again. REALLY YUMMY.

Fresh & light...need to double the sauce ingredients if you want some for rice or noodles.
Very tastey will make many times.
