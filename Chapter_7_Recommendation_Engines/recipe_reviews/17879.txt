I wasn't happy with this recipe. For one, it needs more milk. The correct ratio is 1/4 cup flour to 3, or 3-1/2 cups milk. The onion, garlic and parsley are odd pairings for a milk gravy; so in my second try I left these out and added 1/4 teaspoon ground sage and a dash or two of fine ground white pepper, to boost the sausage flavor. No salt necessary; guests should be allowed to salt according to taste. My personal preferance for sausage is Jimmy Dean Regular flavor in the bulk roll. It works best for sausage gravy.

I almost went out for breakfast this morning, but before I did I checked to see if there was any breakfast recipes that I would rather try. I saw this one with the onions and thought it sounded better than going out for breakfast.  I'm glad I did because this really hit the spot.  I didn't have sausage in the frig but I did have some kielbasa.If you are a fan of biscuits and gravy, I recomend giving this one a try... It's a quick, easy and VERY tasty breakfast. It's my new favorite gravy recipe! However, this recipe, as written, says it will serve four people... It is perhaps enough for two. I ate it all myself!

Here is how I make mine: I heat up a store bought frozen garlic loaf of bread in the oven for about 10 minutes. I steam the sausage first then pan fry without the onion. In a separate bowl I wisk together 1 cup milk, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, salt, pepper and dried parseley flakes. When the sausage is almost ready, I pour the milk mixture in and bring to a boil. I serve this over the garlic bread. This has now become the most requested breakfast item in my home, with even a die-hard vegetarian hartily eating it!!

Awesome! It's pretty  yummy! (And those are hubby's exact words.) I used kielbasa too, and fresh minced garlic instead but that was all I changed and it went over big!

I've only had biscuits and gravy a few times, and it's never wowed me, but this gravy was pretty darned good. I'm not sure, but it might also be the first time I've ever made gravy from scratch. I made it exactly as written, using a white onion, exactly 1 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 cup of milk. I also shook on some salt and ground white pepper, but the results tasted a little too salty/peppery; maybe the sausage already had these ingredients, so I'd omit them next time. One thing I definitely noticed was that the gravy thickened up very quickly and was not very liquid at all; that's why so many reviewers have said that more milk is needed. Still, I had this for 2 consecutive breakfasts, served over a package of ready-to-bake refrigerated homestyle biscuits, and enjoyed it a lot. I'll probably make this again soon, and I do recommend the recipe. Thanks.

It was good, defiantly needed more milk to thin out the gravy.  Replace the parsley with sage and it tastes much better.

found this sausage gravy recipe to be the easiest even for someone not from the "south".  Husband loved it.

I like the added zest the onions give to this recipe.  Most sausage gravy recipes omit onions.

This recipie was great.  I ended up adding a  little bit of bacon grease.  My finance absolutely LOVED it over biscuits!  I will definately use this again.

This was OK, but thought it had a bit too much garlic powder.  If I make this again I will cut the garlic in half and whisk the flour in with the milk before adding to the meat just to make sure there are no lumps.

My first time making homemade sausage gravy! I have no complaints. There was none left. This I found very flavorful and you can change up the spices if you like. It doesn't have a ton of the white gravy part, so increase milk and flour if you don't want it really chunky.
