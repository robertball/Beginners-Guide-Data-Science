this recipe is correct but not perfect. i'm a pro at making these cookies. and for the record they are called peanut butter blossom cookies. ladies if you want to mix it up buy different types of kisses: plain caramel truffle my favorite is the mint ones only out at christmas though so get them fast. by the way DON'T use colored sugar it looks awful and tacky use plain sugar they come out looking beautiful and elegant instead of you 4 year old accidentally spilling food coloring on them. best regards and happy cooking

I love these cookies. I just wanted to sit there eating the whole bowl but sadly I was making them for a party. I tried putting mini peanut butter cups on top for some variation but the whole peanut butter cup melted flat. If you're going to be stacking them on a bowl or something, put them in the refrigerator in separate layers so the chocolate kiss has time to set and won't stick to a cookie placed on top.

These are yummy! I did put my sugar in a ziploc after I formed them in a ball. This saved alot of time rather then trying to roll them in the sugar. After cooling on the cooling rack I put some in a container in the freezer to firm up the chocolate for easier stacking.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I did half with the green and red sugar for decoration and half without. I actually liked the look of the ones without better but both tasted great. Gonna give these out on my cookie plate for the holidays. Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are made with butter vs shortening like the traditional "blossoms" we make around Christmas time. Personally I like them better. Watched them carefully while they baked so as not to brown the edges too much. Didn't need 12 minutes in my oven Loved them!

The cookies are delicious and super easy to make. I dipped the cookies in orange sugar for another layer Halloween-y feel to them. Topping them with peanut butter kisses would add another peanut punch to these already yummy cookies!

I thought these cookies were perfect...I especially liked that they keep a nice puffy shape when you bake them & don't flatten out too much.

It wasn't what I thought it was going to be... my family and friends liked it kinda but it really crumbles which is a bummer. I was looking for a more solid cookie. It tastes alright though.

YUM! I was looking for the perfect "kiss cookie" recipe and I found it! I've eaten this type of cookie many times but this was my first attempt at making them myself. I could not be more pleased or happy with how easy this recipe was and how deliciously the cookies turned out! I followed the recipe exactly (rare for me) and will continue to do so. No changes needed!:) Thanks!!!

These are excellent cookies. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and the came out puffy didn't spread too much crisp on the outside and chewy inside. My batch made 33 cookies but I do tend to roll them large. I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes on parchment which is the temp and method I bake all my cookies. At 12 minutes they were just lightly browned around the edge. These will be a regular on my holiday cookie tray from now on. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Made these with my 2 and 4 year old last night. It was an easy weeknight cookie and it was also easy to find ways to let them be mom's helper. They unwrapped the kisses and rolled dough balls in sugar. Will add these to cookie rotation.

This is an excellent recipe..i have made it many times..for my taste tho I find a kiss too much chocolate so instead of kisses i just use the chocolate stars that you buy in bulk from brachs..the melt good but retain thier shape and are just a llittle less chocolate..perfect for us..mine are never crumbly..be sure not to leave out the chilling section..and the edges will crack a little when done..over baking may be the cause of cumbling..I also bake them on parchment paper to keep the bottoms from getting dark

Pretty yummy! I think that the peanut butter cookie base was a little plain on it's own (maybe it's the type of peanut butter I was using?) but the chocolate kiss adds that sweetness that you want in a cookie. I didn't roll the ball in sugar because I thought that was just too much sugar. One note: I left my first batch in for 10 min and the bottoms burned a bit so keep an eye on your cookies-it may not take as long as 10-12 min.

This is an excellent recipe. Just the right amount of peanut butter. I didn t have time to chill as I had promised peanut butter chocolate cup cookies in less then an hour so I did them as drop cookies with milk chocolate chips right in the batter. My instincts about this being an excellent versatile recipe were right. Although their appearance was not near as lovely as the picture the taste was perfect. Thank you for submitting this great recipe

With the help of a 6-year old and an 8-year old, we made a huge plate of these wonderful cookies.  We put almond Hershey's kisses on half, and the other half we filled with jelly.  The only thing I did different is that my dough was too soft for whatever reason, and I added about a cup of peanut butter powder to it.  We are serving about 30 adults at a conference, and the kids are thrilled!!!

I have made peanut blossoms for years, I think this recipe is better than the traditional one because the cookies are softer. I found refrigerating the dough  makes them easier to roll by hand. I made the balls smaller and substituted a chocolate melting chip for the kiss. This made the cookie go chocolate ratio more to our taste and makes the batch much easier to store or freeze. Thanks for the recipe!

I cannot say enough good things about this cookie.  I do not give 5’s easily!  Loved everything about it.  Easy to make and bake.  Loved that they did not overly spread.  The grandkids love gummy candy so I was able to do kisses, gummy bears and cut some small Peanut Butter cups in half and used those too.  Will definitely use this recipe again and that is saying something because I have a habit of liking to try many things before repeats! Thank you Mary for a great cookie recipe.  Be safe in this time of social distancing and lots of cookie baking!

This recipe was spot on! The only change I made was very minor and more to suit my taste. I increased the amount of baking sofa to 1/2 tsp because I like crispy cookies. I am a trained chef/cook and have been writing rewriting and reviewing recipes for many years. I love a recipe that is precise clear and delicious. This recipe is all of that. Many thanks!

IN LOVE. These are so easy to make. My family loves it and I love how you can put any type of chocolate kiss in the middle and you can a different kind of extract. I used Mint and then I used mint chocolate in the middle and it was so good. I am just IN LLLOOOOOOOOOVVEE with this recipe
