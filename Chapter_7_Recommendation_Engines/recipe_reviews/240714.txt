Very good flavor!  I had about two and a half pounds of pork on hand, so I doubled everything else (left out the spinach) and it turned out great!  The whole family loved it, and we have enough to last for a few meals!  I would agree with the other reviewer... peas would be a tasty addition!  (We used them as a side dish, but were great mixed in.)

A hit with the family. I did have to make some changes due to what I had on hand. Most notably exchanging the apple juice for the juice from my canned peaches and the apple for a pear. Next time I think mushrooms and peas will join the pot.
