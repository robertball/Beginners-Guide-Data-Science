These kind of remind me of a slightly-better-for-you no-bake cookie. I like that a lot! They're really easy to throw together and make for a good grab-and-go breakfast. I put the mixture into a 9 x 5" loaf pan instead of an 8 x 8", and then cut them into 10 bars.  This made for a slightly thicker bar that didn't soften as quickly once it was out of the freezer. Overall, we really liked these! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my word . . . these are GOOD! I made these exactly as directed, and was pleasantly surprised by the results. I actually like them slightly thawed and on the soft/chewy side. You can really taste all of the flavors in these, and one flavor does not over-power another. So easy to make too! Thanks France, for the recipe!

I made these with 6 tablespoons of ovaltine and 1 tbsp on honey (as I don't have carnation instant breakfast) and added 1/4 cup of chocolate pieces. I also used a small plastic container lined with pam sprayed parchment, since the didn't need to be cooked.  They were pretty good and not too sweet.

These are great! I substituted peanut butter for the almond butter because it's what I had on hand. I made these for my son for a quick on the go breakfast and he loves them. They taste really decadent, but they're actually good for you, which is always a bonus for us moms!

My 13 year old son wanted ALL of the bars!! This was easy to make, which is a plus for my family. I agree with others - straight from the freezer is perfect!! Thanks for a delicious recipe.

These were a great guilt-free treat!  I loved the texture slightly thawed right from the freezer.  The texture reminded me of a no-bake chocolate oat cookie which I really liked.  They had a little bit of a strong banana taste for me, but, my husband liked them as is.  It could have been the size banana I used.

9.1.18  I agree with the recipe submitter.  These bars do soften pretty quickly, but their consistency is spot on coming right out of the freezer.  Don’t worry, you won’t break a tooth, it’s perfectly O.K. to enjoy them immediately.  Not one flavor dominates, and they’re simply creamy and chocolatey.  I cut mine into 16 pieces, so they’re one bite.  Super easy to make, and I love having these on hand in freezer for a quick morning breakfast with a cup of coffee or a satisfying snack later in the day.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
