I'm sitting here with the flu, freezing and have a 101 temp. I saw this and thought I really want that... so I made it. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a tiny bit of Tia Maria (like Kahlua but better ha ha) - let me tell you this is a royal treat. I feel better already and I haven't finished it yet!

I used the "Eggnog from Scratch" recipe on this sight for the Eggnog, and used more like a 1 1/2 cups of Eggnog for a more eggnog flavor. Was great, and for the espresso, I used 3 Tablespoon Dunkin Donuts reg. with 1/2 cup water to brew, very nice... Loved it...

Delicious! I actually do not like eggnog, but I thought it would be okay mixed in a latte so I bought Pumpkin Eggnog. It was very thick and creamy and the pumpkn eggnog latte tasted more like a Pumpkin Spice Latte that many people love. Added some homemade whipped cream on top!

This is the same ratio I use when making my Eggnog Lattes. I use skim milk and the lowest fat eggnog I can find. Yummy! Can't wait for eggnog to be on the store shelves.

I thought this tasted pretty good, but you have to really like eggnog to appreciate it. The eggnog taste really comes through. I used a strong brewed coffee and then mixed the eggnog and milk, microwaved them, and then used my Aerolatte whisk. I was told about Silk brand eggnog the other day and used that. For those who can't have eggnog, because of the cholesterol, it is a nice subtitute. The coffee needs a little something else though. I seen on-line that eggnog syrup can be purchased. I am waiting for a recipe for it. Either way, I did top it with a little lite whipped cream and then the nutmeg as suggested. TY

Okay. Not great. You can taste the eggnog, but it's not knock-down awesome.

Pretty good!  I used all egg nog, and omitted the milk.  I used a Kahlua flavored coffee in my Keurig and this was delish!

A very simple recipe that is just delicious.  I think I have made at least one a day since finding this recipe.  Very good - Thanks for such a great and easy recipe to warm up the cold fall mornings!

This recipe is fine, but we prefer it with straight eggnog; more calories, but also more flavor!

absolutely loved this as is.  i used my small milk frother machine and it worked great.  i don't have an espresso machine, but i used a Green Mountain Espresso Blend k-cup in my Keurig on the smallest setting.  This recipe makes 2 glasses with only 1 k-cup.

This is essentially what I have been making the last few days without even seeing this. Personally I prefer all eggnog, and topping it with pumpkin pie spice, but either way it is AMAZING. I'm about to head to the store for more eggnog now! =)

I used the Easiest Eggnog from this site
to make this. With it being mid-June, I
haven't had an eggnog latte since....late December. I made it over ice minus the milk called for. 

Cured my "missing-winter" blues. Thanks!

This was okay.  I added some vanilla syrup to make it a bit sweeter.

I have had so many eggnog lattes at Starbucks but the prices really add up. I was looking around for a simple recipe for an eggnog latte that tasted great and like the one for Starbucks. This tastes exactly like the one from Starbucks and it's a overall great recipe.

I don't like eggnog lattes, but THESE I do like. I use a strong serving of Cafe Bustello to make an espresso shot with a Vietnamese press. Then froth the eggnog and milk in my frother and it's great.

This recipe is awesome.  I hard an eggnog latte at "Borders" and this recipe tastes just like theirs.  Definitely will use this again.
