Use the water you soak your mushrooms in for additional flavor. I didn't have anywhere near 5 pounds of pork leg so I added 1/2 pound of ground pork that needed used up. I also had some shaved carrots that needed used and I added them in the last 20 minutes of cooking. This turned out a lot better than I expected and is something I would make again. I had the leftover today and added a generous squirt of Sriracha and that added a nice touch as well.
