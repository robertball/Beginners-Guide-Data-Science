Great stuff! I made this for the Superbowl and it it was a hit. I will admit it was good, but not GREAT. The reason behind this is I feel it is lacking something, but couldn't place it. Everyone else said it was excellent and better than any kind of nacho dip they had before. The only problems I ran into was that first the velvetta cheese was VERY thick and needed to be melted quickly (please take into account if this is your first time making this the cheese will initially need about an hour or so to melt where you can mix everything else into it) I wound up throwing my crock pot ceramic into the microwave for a few minutes to melt the cheese. After I got everything mixed together make sure you watch that crock pot!! I found out that "low" on my crockpot was boiling the cheese on the edge scalding it. I then had to constantly turn the pot on and off and on and off. I am not sure if this is just how my crockpot is or not, but just be forewarned. Another hint I suggest is have everyone scoop their own from the crockpot with plastic spoons because if you reuse the same spoon the cheese cools and hardens and looks kind of gross and turns people away from scooping it on their plate. Other than that, great recipe and I will be making it again, this time with a crockpot liner because dried baked cheese it not fun to clean.

I loved this recipe!  I made a few adjustments though.  Since I was making the dip for a crowd of almost 20 I had to double it--and instead of having 2 lbs of sausage, I used 1 lb. of spicy sausage and 1 lb. ground beef.  Instead of just diced green chile peppers I used the Rotel diced tomatos with green chiles.  Also, the dip was a little thick for my tastes, so I used some whole milk to give the dip a creamier texture.  Yumm Yumm!

This is a great recipie, but exclude the nacho cheese can and add 3/4 cup whole milk instead. This will keep it creamy, and add 1can rotel chile to spice it up!

I cubed the cheese and put it into a microwave safe bowl and melted it in the microwave first. Then I poured it into the slow cooker and added the balance of ingredients, stirred thoroughly and set the dial to warm.  It was great!!

This dip was SO good!  My fiance and I are lovers of all things cheese dip.  I found this recipe when I was looking for a Queso dip recipe to make for a Halloween Party, and thought it sounded pretty good.  I followed the directions and measurements; however, I did add about a 1/2 cup of 2% milk to make it less thick, and I used a can of the Rotel tomatos and diced green-chiles, instead of using just chiles.  I also noticed some people commented on having difficulties in melting the cheese; either that it took too long, or burned to the sides of the crock-pot.  I poured a little of my milk in first, then put all the cheese in on top (I cute mine into REALLY small pieces).  I turned the crock-pot on to low to gradually warm it, then turned it to warm, then to high.  I stirred the cheese pretty frequently while it was melting, and continually added a few drops of milk to keep it from getting too thick.  After it almost completely melted, I turned the crock-pot back to low. It did not specify on a type of sausage, other than spicy, so I used chorizo, which I think gave it extra flavor.   I will definitely make this again.  I may even try adding onions, black beans, or extra meat next time.

Neither my husband or I liked this recipe.  The cheese dip was too thick and once it cooled on my plate it was a gelatin mass.  I'm not a big processed cheese fan either, and the other flavors did not make up for this.

Love this! I use a block of velveeta cheese instead of the cheese soup and rotel works good in place of the chiles. I also add cream of mushroom soup. SOOO good.

Very good- I like the consistency which is a bit thinner than traditional velveeta dip.  I like a bit more spice and added a can of hot rotel.  Will make again-

This was a total hit with me and my husband.  I made it without the peppers.  I chilled it and it turned out to be a perfect cheese spread for some sliced summer sausage.

I make this at all of my sports crazed husbands gatherings, lol..although, one thing that I do is add a jar of chunky black bean and corn salsa. I have never used the soup but the salsa gives it that extra kick. When cooking my sausage I also add 1/2 cup of onions to brown with it. It makes a world of difference with the salsa, I promise!

I am going to add chopped/shredded pepperoni instead of sausage. (I have a lot of left overs) and will use milk instead to cream it down more. Like the use your own spoon tip!

I this a great hi I did make some of my own changes. I added a  can of rotel and diced chilies because we like it a little more spicy. Also I used a mixture of beef and sausage. I added about a 1/2 a cup of milk so it was not as thick.

It was a great starter for me. I didn't use the condensed soup cheese upon reading the reviews, I used milk. I also added about 1/2 lb of ground beef. I used cumin and cilantro to spice up the meat. So it came out great!

The family obviously loved it.  They ate it all up.  The chef managed to barely make it out of the kitchen with a tiny sample bowl.  The hubby and the kiddos gobbled the rest all up.  In a single sitting.

This came out pretty well. I did find it to be pretty thick so I added a half cup of milk to the recipe. The processed cheese took a lot longer to melt than the recipe states so I ended up melting it in the microwave and then mixing it all together in the crockpot. The cook time needs to be adjusted on this recipe.

Was really tasty. I made for a large group of people and they all loved it. Cheese flavor was almost a little too much though so I added some sour cream to cut the flavor. Was wonderful
