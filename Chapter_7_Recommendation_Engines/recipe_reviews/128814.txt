This was really, REALLY good!! I'm eating a sandwhich now as we speak!! lol I did a few things differently. I used a little more mayo (we like ours smothered!) I used a LOT more bacon... probably about 4 or 5 crumbled slices... I also used sweet relish instead of dill (because that was all I had) but I think I would have liked it better with dill... but it's still not a deal breaker! I used a little more cheese, and added some franks red hot sauce because I put that on everything... I also used hot pepper rings and it had a wonderful flavor!! I love this!

This was delicious with lettuce and spinach on a wrap, but there was way too much mustard for my taste.  I did use dijon mustard, but it was incredibly overwhelming.   I would cut the amount to 1 T.

This was SO yummy. Because I'm changing the way I eat, cut back on the mayonnaise by almost half and used lowfat mayonnaise. I used a 2% sharp cheddar and dijon mustard. Because I had no relish, I used two large chopped garlic dills. I actually made this early this morning and left it to sit until lunch. My kids and I devoured it. I had theirs on whole wheat bread but I ate mine wrapped in Bibb lettuce. I think this could use a little chopped celery or onion but as is, we enjoyed this and there were no leftovers.

This was excellent and different.  I couldn't imagine the pepperoncini and bacon with the turkey, but they gave it a nice kick.  Will definitely make again.

Not bad though very different.  A little too much mustard for my taste and not quite enough dressing.  Added a couple of tablespoons of vidalia onion dressing (it's a little sweet) and that seemed to take care of both issues.  Also added a little diced onion for crunch and flavor.  Husband liked it but not sure I won't do the traditional next time.

Wow, this is so different.   We loved it because it didn't taste like the rest of Thanksgiving!  I served it on a large loaf of Ciabatta bread with dried cranberries -- with a little side salad, it's a meal!

Oh my gosh, this looks great for that after TG dinner or any time. I just wish I had Turkey to try the recipe. Just by the photo and recipe alone I just know this is a winner. I do agree to use more mayo, bacon, and less mustard. Thanks for the great idea.

added chopped celery for some crunch. Can be eaten as a sandwich or a salad. Doesn't really make 8 servings, more like 4 but oh soooo good!

Had leftover smoked turkey from Father's Day and made this recipe. I followed the recipe and I added diced onions, cut the mustard back and walla!!!! Great salad. Delicious. Nice change from eating dried-up leftover turkey. Family loved it.

The mustard was too much.  I believe I will leave that out next time I try this.  I will just add a little more mayo and maybe some more bacon.

I really liked throwing relish and pepperoncini's in there, but I thought there was too much mustard in this.  It was still good though.

This is really yummy! Iâ€™m generally not a fan of turkey salad but this turned me around! I added a few chopped pecans and dried cranberries too. So tasty!

This was a terrific recipe.  I cut back the mustard like others recommended, but I also used peppered bacon and sweet relish because that's all I had.  Lastly, I added some chopped onion as someone else recommended and it turned out perfect.  I used leftover Kings Hawaiian rolls and served as sliders.

For healthier, skip bacon and pepperoni. Reduce cheese I made it without. I used sweet pickle relish and added hard cooked eggs. Used a little less mustard. Add Rosemary, basil and time. I used fresh from my garden. Very good and don't need extra fat of meats or even cheese.  Eggs give it creamy texture.
