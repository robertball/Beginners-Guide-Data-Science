This was a super hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I used a sunflower seed based "Salad Fixins" instead of just sunflower seeds, and canned bacon bits. Could not have been better... EVERYONE wanted the recipe!

This recipe was very yummy!  I used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I also only used 2/3 cup mayo with 1/3 cup water added to it.  This cut down the fat/calories and it tasted great.  I've recommended this recipe to many friends.  It's great!!!

Good salad Kathy and it makes such an easy and yummy lunch.  I used red wine vinegar, slivered almonds and left out the bacon, because it does get soft after a few hours.  What a great way to eat broccoli!

This recipe is a meal in itself, what with all the protein in bacon, cheese and sunflower seeds!  The raisins and sugar make it very sweet.  The red onion adds zip.  The only noticeable absence is that there is no vinegar in this recipe, which would have been an improvement.

A popular favorite in our extended family--I just got another request to bring some to Christmas Eve dinner.  To speed prep, I use packaged shredded broccoli and then toss in small florets. I almost always doubel the recipe (get a big bowl!) Delicious!

Perfect salad. I used what was on hand....mayo with some red wine vinegar to serve as the miracle whip, toasted almonds instead of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries instead of raisins. So good!

Followed recipe as written but did blanch the broccoli just to take the raw edge off. This brightened up the presentation and allowed the flavors to mix better in my opinion. I also added 1-2 Tbsp. white vinegar because it taste better with it.

I`m not fond of broccoli, but this recipe is delicious. I reduced the amount of salad dressing, thinned the remaining with apple juice. There are many variations that will work nicely with this winning recipe.

Question? After preparing this salad, how long will it keep in the fridge? I would like to make it 2 days ahead of an event I am hosting.

My family really enjoyed the brocolli salad but I changed a few things. First no raisins and I add viegor (small teaspoon or less) to the mirical whip and sugar. I add Bacon bits before serving because if the sit in the Salad overnight the taste soggy and gross the next day.

Yes, this is a very good one.  I would suggest using real bacon and slightly less Miracle Whip.  You can also use different vinegar for added flavour, like apple cider vinegar.

Love this salad & my brocoli hating husband did too!  A few changes - dressing is 1/2 miracle whip & 1/2 plain yogurt with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice & sugar.  Used slivered almonds, added leftover corn on the cob and feta cheese.  Rave reviews from all the family.  Thanks Welldone for a great recipe.

I make this every summer.  The only change I made was leaving out the onions, since I do not like them.  I make this the night before.  That way the raisins have time to absorb the moisture and becme plump.

this is my favorite version of broccoli salad! it tastes almost exactly like the one i pay $6 a pound for at the grocery store's salad bar.  i made a few small changes, only per taste: i added a few squirts of lemon juice to the dressing, i left out the sunflower seeds and raisins, and used freshly cooked bacon. also, i added shredded carrots to mine!

Took this to a pot luck and had requests for the recipe.  I did not have raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries.  Also used regular mayonnaise, not Miracle Whip.

I make this very often for family events, and over time I've adapted it to our tastes.  I use regular mayonnaise to get a less sweet flavor. We also add shredded carrots and chopped apples. this salad goes great with anything, just don't make too much because it doesn't keep well.

This is always a big hit.  Tastes just like the one you find on the salad bar at Ruby Tuesday's.  I use a bacon ranch dressing for mine.

HOORAY, HOORAY HOORAY!!!!
What a hit this was.  I tasted this salad at a party and decided to look up the recipe.  We had a salad luncheon at work and every one had to bring a salad.  We had a contest for the best salad at the luncheon, and this recipe won hands down.  I found this recipe the day before and did not change a single item.  Everyone loved it and they insist that I bring it to all the functions.
Thanks

Left out the rasins and the sugar. I mixed some lemon juice and a bunch of minced garlic with the mayo. Turned out so tangy, yet creamy at the same time. LOVED it! :)

Good but not great.  I expected more after reading all the glowing reviews.  The taste was similar to a Waldorf salad which I thought too sweet for the broccoli.

This was very good. I left out the raisins as we don't care for them. My husband says " It's a keeper" Thanks for sharing it

What a great salad! I've been making a different version of broccoli salad for years; but with that one the dressing has to sit for at least several hours. I was short on time and decided to check Allrecipes.com. This one went together so quickly and everyone who tried it at my party made a point of telling me how much they loved it! I'll definitely make this one again.

All my guests love this recipe. I used 2 broccoli heads and cut the dressing in half. Still plenty to coat. I only added a half a cup of chopped onion.
Great recipe!

I found this kinda dry.  I would blanch the broccoli if I ever attempted this recipe again.  Fresh broccoli is dull green and unappealing looking.  Blanching brightens the color and makes the vegetable less dry.

Loved this basic how to Salad.  I am not a fan of rasins or seeds in my salad so I left them out and added some cooked carrot and a tablespoon of vinegar for some zip!  I did however blanche briefly the broccoli to really bring out the colour!

I thought it was a bit too onion-y for my personal tastes... but it was a big hit at Christmas dinner... even my vegetable-hating husband said that I should make it again.

This was the recipe I was looking for!!  I've had this at BBQ's and thought it was fantastic.  I used craisins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins.  I used half of a large red onion and that was plenty.  Thanks for the great recipe!!  I'll double it next time!

Exactly what I was looking for.  There seemed to be extra mayo and everything else.  So I will keep extra broccoli on hand to add to the mix. There really isn't a standard size broccoli head.

Excellent.  Taste the dressing before adding all of the sugar.  I think we could have done with a tablespoon or so less. Very good!

This was great.  I used Mayo and Splenda instead of Miracle Whip and sugar as some other reviews suggested.  I also substituted the slivered almonds in place of the sunflower seeds for personal taste.  My husband and I both thought it was delicious.  Will be making again.

Love it! I use real bacon and substitute mozzarella for cheddar. It's always a hit!  I sometimes cheat when I make this by using Marie's Poppyseed Dressing instead of what's in this recipe, the prepared dressing makes it easy to mix up a small batch.

Fantastic.  If you have the time, use real crumbled bacon...if you don't have the time, you can omit it completely and it still tastes unbelievable.

My grandma needed a recipe for broccoli and i found this one. She made it for a party she went to and it was a hit. She has made it again and my grandpa who doesn't really eat this type of thing really enjoys it. She just made another batch and it was my first time to try it and i took it all home with me. It was perfect. Now my husband is hooked on it. I will be making this quite often. Thanks for this recipe. It is one of my favorites.

This was good but I expected it to be a little creamier or....something.  I think I will reduce the amount of onion next time.  It was a bit overpowering.

Very yummy!  A great combination of flavors and textures.  Made this for a party (increasing the recipe for 30 people) and everyone raved about it, even people who said they don't usually like broccoli.  I did decrease the amount of onion slightly (called for about four onions for that many people which seemed like a lot) and chopped it very fine, but other than that, made it according to the recipe.  Many asked for the recipe and this one will definitely be a standard go to recipe for salad.

This is the recipe that has been in my family for years, sans the cheese!  I make it with reduced fat Mayo and splenda, and it is just fabulous!  Great to make a day ahead for church pitch-ins or family picnics!

I used the dressing from this recipe for my broccoli salad.  The dressing is delicious!! I used fresh broccoli florets, finely diced red onion, chopped pecans, golden raisins and topped with some crumbled bacon.  This totally hit the spot!!!!!!  It was extra good when I made it this time because of this dressing!  What a pretty and yummy salad!  Thanks

A very delicious broccoli salad; the first that I have ever made, and I will certainly make again. Instead of using sunflower seeds, I used sliced almonds. Next time I make it, I will use less red onion.. I only used half of what the recipe called for, and I still thought it was overpowering!

Delicious. I made a couple of changes, based on personal and family tastes. I left out the sunflower seeds, only used 1/2 a red onion and used crasins rather than raisins. It was a hit! I will make this again with my changes.

This broccoli salad was great.  I changed the recipe a bit by blanching the broccoli florets and omitting the sugar.  Instead, I mixed the mayonnaise with a few tablespoons of Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar which added really great flavor.

This was truly delicious.  I took it to church tonight and there was none left over. However, my dressing broke down and was almost like water.  I added some sour cream to try to thicken it some, (which gave a fabulous flavor by the way), but it didn't help.  I'm giving it a 5 because it truly is tasty, and I know the runny dressing was totally something I did wrong.  thanks

Delicious and quick brocolli salad!!  I didn't add onion at all( pregnant and can't stand them right now), but you will need to double the recipe if you are feeding more than 2 people!  Love this recipe.

Awsome recipe, especially if you adore fresh broccoli as I do (although, I'll soon have to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford it!)  I may be the only person on earth who dislikes bacon right?  Anyhoo, I added a big handful of diced turkey ham, can't imagine it getting better than that!

Love this recipe, it was a hit at our recent potluck!  Quite simple to make and ever so yummy.  I modified it by cooking my own bacon in lieu of using bacon bits and also found that I could reduce the amount of Miracle Whip.  This is a favorite for sure.  Thank you!

4.5 stars.

I made this salad with a few changes:
- doubled the broccoli since my first head was a bit on the small side
- cut back the sugar by 1 Tbsp
- reduced the amount of onion (I had a really large onion so I only used half)
- added just under 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar
- added pepper to taste

All in all, it was great! The sugar reduction really helped as the fresh broccoli and raisins were plenty sweet, and the ACV added just the right amount of acidity. Will add to my rotation, thanks!

Always a hit. The combination of sweet, sour, salty and crunch is just delicious. I always add just a pinch of cayenne to spice it up.

Im a vegetarian, husband isnt, so I used baco bits for me and real bacon for the hubby. I omitted the sunflower seeds but did everything else exact. I really enjoyed it but my husband didnt. It came out good, just not his cup of tea.

Amazing taste! I'm just now growing out of my fear of raw onions, and this was a good way to get used to them.  I didn't use all of the mayo and sugar, either.  Basically, I just put in the ingredients eyeing what I thought was good.  It's a great combination of flavors and I'm going to make this regularly!

Always looking for new, tasty ways to serve veggies when I came across this in a Ruby Tuesday's. This receipe tastes exactly like it and my family loved it! Will probably make it again.

Very good! Did the low carb thing like others (mayo & splenda), but also used dried blueberries instead of raisins. (not a big fan) I also only used 1/4 cup since they have sugar. I love the crunch of the sunflower seeds & the slight sweetness of the random blueberries! Thanks!Oh- it's much easier to just use the real bacon bits. (Hormel) I also recommend MUCH less onion.

I watch my carbs so I changed this recipe just slightly. Instead of miracle whip I used regular mayo and instead of sugar I used Splenda. This is one of my favorite salads!
