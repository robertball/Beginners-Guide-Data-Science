This was some great soup! Just one note; The recipe says to add the garlic cloves to the pot....should they be roasted with the potatoes? I roasted them and the soup was delicious!

Thought this was was really good. I think it would be even better the longer it sat but it didn't have time to sit very long before it was all gone. Even my son the picky eater ate 2 bowls. Personally i didnt put it in a blender til smooth. I used a potato masher, left everything in the pot and mashed it up some in the pot. I used larger chunks of potato so i was able to just mash those up into smaller ones. Topped it off with light cheddar, bacon bits and chives. I didnt hold any of the potatos back in reserve. I didnt even use any oil as it said to do so i could cut the fat count down further. Great recipe and great base for other things. Thanks.

I've made this twice & I really like it.  I added the garlic to the potatoes & roasted them, too.  This time I just mashed the potatoes, so it would be a little bit chunky and added some ham and colby/jack cheese.  YUM!  Don't forget a nice loaf of crusty bread!

Loaded with flavor.  Easy up on the milk for garlic mashpotatoes, then add milk to any leftovers to complete this as a soup.  Nice and hearty!

This is a great soup for such a simple recipe!  It's even easier when using the potato masher instead of a blender (less clean-up, too).  I always end up using at least 4 cups of chicken broth, but it's really up to your preference for how thick you want your soup.  Definitely roast your garlic in the pan with the potatoes (I always throw in a couple more cloves than called for).  Also, I like to sprinkle some oregano or thyme on the potatoes & garlic mix before roasting for additional flavor.  I've done this recipe with peeled potatoes and with skin-on and it comes out great either way.  When we have leftover ham, adding it to this soup really kicks it up a notch. Serve w/ homemade garlic parmesan bread.  Yummy!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This soup was prety good. Very easy to make. I followed the recipe as instructed, but I omited the milk (we don't drink milk) and the taste was good. I think it will taste better tomorrow for left overs once the falvours have more time to settle. I used white potatoes and left the peel on them.

Easy & quick. Variations abound. Increase health factor with small amount of baked cauliflower & a sweet potato completely blended in. Great to chase the Winter chills.

This is a really good base for a soup, and I was surprised that with so few ingredients it had such a good flavor. I used red potatoes (leaving the skins on for a nice color), roasted the garlic with them, and sprinkled some oregano and salt in with the pepper and olive oil.  I used red onions also.  At first, the soup was quite a bit thinner than I normally like my cream soups, but I was able to solve this by simply adding in the potatoes I had reserved.  For this I just used a hand mixer (not a blender)  to keep some of the chunks in tact, and garnished with shredded parmesan and crumbled bacon.  Overall, I was pleased.  I'm even looking forward to leftovers for lunch.

Awesome and EASY!! I used about 8 new potatoes, increased broth to 5 cups and used heavy cream instead of whole milk. Also added a little Cayenne Pepper and this gave it just the kick it needed. Will definitely be making this one again soon!!

I thought this was pretty good and would make it again. I used red potatoes and didn't peel them, because I'm lazy and who likes peeling potatoes anyway?! =) The peels mixed right in after the trip through the blender, and they gave a little color to the soup.

I doubled this recipe. Instead of adding the cup of water, I added another cup of chicken broth. I also added in a good amount of crisp, crumbled bacon and a few spices (dried dill weed, fresh chives, little hot sauce). My family ate this whole pot in two days--we loved it.

Delicious!  With a couple adaptations we thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It took a little longer to roast the potatoes. I added a bay leaf along with the broth. To serve, a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese was added on top of the roasted potatoes.

It's okay. Nothing great. It is, though, fairly easy to make. A good last resort if there's nothing else around.

This soup was amazing!  I took the advice of some other reviews and I roasted the garlic cloves with the potatoes, I also used a roasted garlic olive oil to roast the potatoes in, and turned it vegan by using veggie broth and almond milk.  My husband who is not vegan said it was my best vegan soup to date :)

I really liked this recipe. I did as the others did and roasted the garlic with the potatoes. Also I added a bay leaf while it simmered.  But I did have to add more liquid because after mashing the potatoes, it was more like mashed potatoes..lol.  So I added about 2 cups more chicken broth just before adding the milk. It was wonderful though. Just watch how thick it can get.

I made a vegan double-batch (veggie broth, no milk) and it turned out really well - the potatoes themselves were enough to thicken the soup and it was still surprisingly creamy! Followed other users' advice and roasted the garlic with the potatoes - good choice. I also left the skins on the potatoes and instead of reserving whole cubes for garnish, I just reserved the crackled skins that stuck to the bottom of the roasting pan - delicious!! We'll definitely be making this again.

This soup had great flavor. The only problem I had was the extra potatoes didn't get bakeed long enough. They were somewhat hard. I will lengthen the baking time next time.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this soup.  It definitely requires all of the liquid that's listed in the recipe.  At first I tried using only 2 cups of chicken broth (1 can) and it was too much like mashed potatoes.  I added the other cup and it created a great, thick soup.  Also, roast the garlic WITH the potatoes.  Will be adding a dollop of sour cream and some bacon bits on top.

Tasted great, but needed to be thinned out tons!!  It was like mashed potatos. I'd say add at least 5-10 cups of broth.

Worked out to my surprise. First thing I have cooked in 15 years. My wife and daughter do most of the cooking.  I decided to give it a try. Used 24 tiny potatoes unpeeled, both white and red. Baked potatoes at 400 for 16 min due to size. My wife loved it. Given green light to use kitchen again!!!!

Oh, my god. This soup is amazing! I made it in a vegan version (no, I'm not a vegan, but let's just say it is necessary). 

My vegan version: Use 4 cups of vegetable broth (skip the 1 cup water in the recipe)

Stir in a 1/4 tsp tumeric and 1/4 tsp paprika (smoked paprika, if you have it) to the sautéed onions. 

Substitute coconut milk (8 oz in can) in place of the milk. 

I doubled all ingredients and it made 3 quarts of soup) Yum! Yum!

It was a great starting point for soup! I changed it up a bit. I boiled potatoes till almost soft, then roasted them. Great outcome. Also I roast 2 full garlic heads with top cut off and drizzled with olive oil, wrap up in aluminum foil and roast  for 425 for 30 minutes, depending on size of garlic. We love garlic and it sweetens up. I also did my onions (4meduim sized),added 4 stalks celery, with half a bag of carrots (8oz)? .   I chopped them up in food processor, and simmer them together with olive oil. I used more potatoes,the small different kinds, probably 4 1lb bags. And I used 4 cups chicken broth instead of water. I processed potatoes after roasting, we do not like puréed soup. I also added 2 tablespoons of sugar to balance flavor. Also 1 teaspoon of garlic salt and coarsely  ground black pepper. Followed rest of directions and also added 6 pieces of crumbled cooked bacon. And for serving, dollop of sour cream and rest of bacon bits. Delicious! I forgot the most important ingredient to thicken..8 ounces of room  temperature cream cheese, cut in small cubes Added at end. Do not boil.

SO GOOD. You should definitely roast the garlic and even the onion with the potatoes. I didn't peel my potatoes because I like a more rustic feel. Oh, to die for.

Good recipe, good flavor... Just not sure what happened to mine. I used 6 potatoes as the recipe calls for, not sure what size potatoes they used, but I used regular bakers. when i added the 3 cups of stock and 1 cup of water it didnt even cover the potatoes ( I did not reserve and for serving) so i added another cup of stock (a whole box of organic stock is 4 cups btw). I also roasted the garlic with the potatoes. After simmering for 20 minutes I used my immersion blender and the consistency was like mashed potatoes, I ended up having to add over 6 cups of water to bring it down to what I would consider a thick chowder (kids compared it to gravy). I also added a bunch of salt, didnt measure, but each time tasted it needed more. I topped it with shredded cheddar, bacon and chives. Could have done without the chives. Flavor was really good though, i will make it again.

Really good stuff! My children asked me to make it again.  The only thing I am going to change is the blender.  I'm just going to mash it with a potato masher instead.  The puree from the blender made us all think of mashed potatoes that had too much liquid it them.  I guess we prefer something with more texture.

Although there wasn't anything wrong w/the recipe my husband and I did not love this. I think it had something to do w/the consistency. If I make it again I would try mashing it instead of blending it like some of the other reviewers. Other than trying that I wouldn't make it again.

I made a vegan version of this recipe (Using veggie broth & plain soy milk). With those changes, I thought this made a wonderful soup. Thanks for posting the recipe, I'm looking forward to making this again!

Gooey mess until I added extra milk. We ate it once, the rest went to waste in the fridge. I don't think I'll make it again.

I'm not sure if the potatoes I used were too big but I ended up needing 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of milk in order to get a texture more like soup than mashed potatoes. With those changes however it was excellent! Very filling!

As suggested I roasted the garlic along with the potatoes. I used half and half because I was out of milk. I did let it sit overnight and we had it the next day, with salad and crusty bread. Very Tasty event he 5 yr old loved it.

Made this with already roasted garlic--just tossed in a number of cloves.  It's very good, but I think I'd add ham or bacon next time.  I used smaller red potatoes and halved the recipe, so used 6 potatoes.  I don't have a blender but I used my trusty food processor and it was fine. Although I generally like larger chunks of potato, I actually wasn't a fan of putting the reserved potatoes on top; didn't like the chunks that way.  I think I will process it all next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with those who used a potato masher, using a blender turned my soup into a gummy mess! And, it was way too thick. However, the soup had great flavor. I sauted my onion in bacon grease which added a great deal of flavor. In an effort cause a distration to the starch, gummy nature of the soup I added some chorizo sausage. Next time around I will use a potato masher, or force the soup through a tamis to avoid getting such a gummy result.

A little thinner than i like my cream soups. And i didn't add the water with the broth at the end. Good flavor but it needs something. I will keep working on it. It is a good starter base for a soup.

This soup was just alright! It was ridiculously thick and i could only eat a half bowl after adding more water to it!  Probably won't make it again!
