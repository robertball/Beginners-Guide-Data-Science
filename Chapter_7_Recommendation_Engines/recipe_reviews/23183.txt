I rather like this.  It's great on those new flat wraps.  I would just like it "taken up a notch." I added some finely chopped ham and it was great.  A very handy recipe for parties.

This is a great recipe.  I love it on pita wedges.  It's a great filling for wraps. Just cut the filled wraps into spirals.  Very yummy.

Easy to make. I used carrots that were already shredded for easier prep. The sandwiches were great.

I was looking for a recipe to use as a substitute for the Philadelpia Cream cheese garden vegetable product to eat on bagels.  I made this recipe as is except I finely chopped the carrots instead of shredding them and also I used finely chopped celery instead of zucchini since that is what I had on hand.  Delicious on crackers too!

I am allergic to onions so I deleted the onion powder.  could be used as a dip or spread.  Great for vegetarians!

I had to blend the cream cheese before adding it.  "Softening" it by sitting out for an hour still wasn't enough to make it mixable with other ingredients.  Taste was good but not great.

Blended and used half Tofutti vegan cream cheese and half regular cream cheese.

Delicious! I halved the recipe since I only had one package of cream cheese, and I also mixed in about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. My kids love this spread on tortillas with a few slices of ham and rolled up, it's so good and makes a quick and yummy lunch. Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

Good, quick, and healthy. Especialy if you use reduced fat or fat free cream cheese. Great as a carrot dip too!

I made this with Neufchatel cheese to reduce the fat content, with finely chopped carrots and green onion.  No zucchini this time, but I like the idea.  Rolled the spread and some leaf lettuce in a flour tortilla for a very tasty light meal.

Yum!  I made using light cream cheese and left out the garlic salt.  It was really good - tasted just like a vegetable cream cheese you get at a bagel shop.  I served with crackers and veggie strips.

Way too soupy....not sure what I did wrong.  Ended up throwing it out.  Honestly, slice of cucumber on a piece of bread with mayo is just as satisfying with much less trouble.

I thought this was a great idea to use up some of my zucchini. You must press as much water as possible out of the zucchini if you don't want it to be watery, especially after it sits in the fridge awhile. I made half a batch, and after tasting, I added 3 green onions and a few drops of worcestershire sauce. I would probably add a few less carrots next time, as the whole spread turned orange. I spread it on a wrap and added turkey slices for lunch yesterday. And today I ate it with crackers. It was good both ways.
