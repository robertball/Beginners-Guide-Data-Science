Delicious.  I chopped sage and parsley into soften butter and refrigerated it. I put small pats of the herb butter under the skin. The bacon added more flavor, there was none of the bacon left and barely any turkey.

I used an 8 pound bone in turkey breast and that worked just fine too. I didn't really taste the bacon in the turkey meat but it sure kept it moist. I had to cover it with foil in the last hour to prevent the bacon from getting too done but other than that I made as written.
