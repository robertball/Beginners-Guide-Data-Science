I haven't made this version on the stovetop in particular, but we make this exact recipe in the crockpot all the time. Can use any cut of meat (tough -- no problem!) Add the whole jar of peppers, juice, peppers and all to the crockpot over the top of your meat. Set the crockpot on high and let it go to work for 8-9. Yes -- on HIGH. The meat is pull-apart tender, very nicely flavored and the peppers just melt in your mouth. Serve it on hard rolls like a philly cheese steak with provolone, american or even queso. Yum!!!

The cherry pepper juice made this recipe very salty, and not spicy at all.  This is not a true London Broil -- not marinated enough by any means -- and is tough and salty.  Use this recipe if you would like to make beef jerky.

Instead of cooking the meat in the juices, I took one cup of the pepper, the olive, 1 clove of garlic and made a paste of it in the food processor.  I poured this over the sirloin and marinaded for one night.  Cooked it on the grill over indirect heat until done.

All I can say is this is excellent.  I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out because I was always taught that London Broil needed to be marinated overnight so that it would be tender, but this was tender and had just the right amount of spice to it.  We served it with rice and poured some of the juices over top of everything.  I now have another recipe for London Broil and what a treat it is.  Thanks for sharing it.

This brought back to mind a similar recipe I used to make with cherry peppers.  First I saute in oil and butter onions and fresh or canned mushrooms, when tender add 1/4 cup of juice from cherry peppers and some sliced cherry peppers heating through and reducing some of the liquid - move to bowl - over med to high heat cook steak of choice for 4 min. on each side (depending on meat thickness).  Remove and keep warm - deglaze pan with a bit of red wine if you have it - add onions, etc. to reheat - pour over steak.  Serve with mashed potato.  I season the veggies with goya seasoning while cooking and also season the steak with it.

Something a little different.  I was afraid braising would ruin the meat's texture, but it did not.  Also, I did't have cherry peppers so I used pepperoncini instead -- it worked fine.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I recommend using a more tender cut of beef than flank steak.

I gave this to my boyfriend to make.  We love trying different ways to do London Broil.  This was pretty good.  Just a hair too spicy for me, but the flavor was great.  A little tough too, but we'll try to cook it a little slower next time.  He added a couple of gloves of garlic, which I would definitely recommend.

Sorry, but this wasn't a hit at our house, and we won't make it again.  Very hot.  However, it made a great Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich the next day.

Excellent recipe.  Spicy but not too spicy.  I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  There is more than enough sodium in hot pepper juice. Also sliced onions paper thin and simmered them along with the meat.  Served all over rice.  Served left overs with mashed potatoes.  A new family favorite!!

To Vneal,  What type of steak to you recommend instead of london broil.  I use flank steak all the time and it comes out very very tender.  You may need to cook it longer and slower.

Cooked as is, and used leftover liquid mixed with water to cook some rice.  The meat wasn't tough like some, but not really tender either.  Mostly, I thought it a bit hot and just too much pepper taste that seemed to over-power the entire meal.

I followed the recipe exact, and cooked on very low heat, and still is turned out very dry. This recipe works if you like your beef very well done, but we like ours more tender, more medium-rare. I will not make this again.

anyone having problems with this recipe,  you must not be adding enough hoit pepper juice,  or you may be cooking it with the flame to high.

It must cook very very SLOW

This one just didn't turn out for me at all.  The meat was so tough I could barely chew it, and the flavor didn't really soak into the meat- it was just noticible on the outer edges.  After cooking & tasting it initially, I tried slicing the meat, combining it with the juices, and simmering it in a soup pot for a while longer, but it was still very tough.  I wonder if it would work in a crockpot??    I think I'll stick to more traditional ways of cooking a London Broil in order to get a more tender piece of meat.

I made this exactly as written and the meat was so tough that it was not edible. I gave up and tossed it in the fridge. The next morning I decided to give it  one last attempt and so I stuck it in the slow cooker, turned it on high, and forgot about it for 6 hours. I was pleasantly surprised. It was so tender that it fell apart when I stuck the fork in it. I did not find this too salty or spicy at all but that might be because I cooked it to death. I think the slow cooker is the key here or either start it on the stove and finish it in the slow cooker as I did. Although I intended to make and eat it as is,  that was not possible. In my attempt to save it, the  end result was the texture of a nicely prepared brisket which is something we love so all was not lost.

The whole family really like the flavor and tenderness of this dish.  I liked how easy it was and how quickly it was ready to serve!  London Broil has never been so appealing for a weekday meal!
