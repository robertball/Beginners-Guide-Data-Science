This has been my absolute favorite treat since I was a small child. This recipe has been passed down from generation to generation and I love it! Although, the recipe my family has is a little bit different than this one...

Tips - Mix the margarine/butter and graham cracker crumbs together to make a firmer "crust". (My family also melts the margarine in the pan in the oven.)

- Pour the condensed milk on the graham cracker crumbs BEFORE adding the other ingredients. It seems to make everything stick together better and it makes it so much more presentable!

- Use more than 1 cup of chocolate chips. Especially if you're a chocolate lover. 1 cup just isn't enough!

Also, I like the recipe better without the nuts. They seem to kind of take away from the other flavors. But I'm not a big fan of nuts in desserts to begin with.

Hope you enjoy these as much as I do! :)

These are great.  I would suggest mixing the graham cracker crumbs and butter together first and pressing into your pan.  Pour Sweetened Condensed Milk over crust, then layer with remaining ingredients.  Makes it all stick together better.  You can substitute chocolate chips or nuts with dried cranberries, raisins, mini marshmallows or butterscotch chips.  So many variations to use.  Always a crowd pleaser.......

Very yummy!  I made a few modifications after reading the reviews - I used chocolate graham crackers and doubled the graham cracker/butter base since a few of the reviewers said the base was a little skimpy as it is - I liked the thickness of the base but would probably use less butter next time.  I put the milk on top of the base since other reviewers said it made for a more attractive bar (I might do half under and half over next time though, to help the toppings stick better) and instead of just semi-sweet chocolate chips I mixed white chocolate chips and chocolate/peanut butter swirled chips. Since the base was thicker it took longer to cook.  I check them after 25 minutes and they were not even close to being done so I covered it with foil to keep the coconut from burning and had to bake it for about 20 additional minutes.  They were awesome once the cooled and set up a bit, I'll definitely make this again!

This is very similar to a recipe I used to make at a bakery I worked at years ago. It's great for people who don't like exact measurements and who like to experiment. At the bakery we used white chocolate, milk chocolate, and butterscotch chips, coconut, walnuts, and sweetened condensed milk. I have also tried peanut butter chips, almonds, and M&M baking pieces, all with great success. The only trick to this recipe is not baking it too long or the sugars in the milk will harden after cooling. Gooey-ness is the key!

This is so delicious! The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the recipe calls for sprinkling the crumbs.  You have to create a crust on the pan and I poured the condensed milk with each layer so everything was nicely layered together without falling apart.

This is such a classic...we always called them 'Hello Dollies.' I poured half of the can of sweetened condensed milk over the crust, then the other half over the enitre thing before baking. I omitted the nuts (going to be serving for a large group, omitted just in case some don't care for/are allergic to), also - I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I just chopped up some Easter chocolate they we have over from Easter this year - used a bit more than a cup. Great recipe - everyone loves it, a lot like Mounds bars.

I totally agree with doubling the crust. I made two batches, the first as the recipe says and the second with a "crust and a half". I wish I had totally doubled it! I have had these bars from a local bakery and I am trying to get them to taste like theirs with no avail. Perhaps a bigger crust? The chocolate chips were a little over-powering. I am wondering if I put less in, or if the consistency of chips changes from brand to brand? I'd love some feedback.

Whenever I make these bars for my college friends, they disappear like crazy!  Out of everything that I bake, these seem to be everybody's favorite.  The only suggestion I would make is to combine the graham cracker crumbs and butter together in a bowl instead of sprinkling the crumbs over the butter.  This makes the crust firmer, and the bars do not break as easily.  Other than that, these bars are excellent, and definitely a crowd pleaser!

This has been a favorite of mine for several years.  Quick, easy, sooo good.  I also recomend replacing the graham crackers with 1/2 of box of yellow cake mix - creates a much richer bar.
ENJOY

Double the crust, but not the butter.  You really only need about 3/4 C. butter/marg if doubling the crust.  Thoroughly mix, then press into pan.  Pour 1/2 can condensed milk on crust, layer remaining ingredients as directed, and top with remaining 1/2 can of condensed milk.  I also doubled the chips and did 1/2 chocolate, 1/2 butterscotch.  These disappeared almost immediately at my company's holiday bake sale.

I made this classic bar cookie when I was in my teens. I made this recipe with my daughter and son. Now I just made this recipe with my grand daughter. It's that good. Absolute best dessert comfort food.

Very versatile recipe!! If you're finding it too sweet, I put Old Fashioned Oats in mine, and it tames the sweetness a little bit. Great recipe, because I was able to put a bunch of random items that have been sitting in our cupboard for a while: stale graham crackers, chocolate chips, chopped pecans, oats. Left out the coconut because we didn't have any and it's still delicious!

These were so delicious!  We couldn't stop eating them.  I mixed the margarine and crumbs before adding it to the pan. I added some more graham cracker crumbs, about 2 1/2 cups total and didn't pour the entire can of milk, just left about a quarter out.  it took me some strength to cut these up into bars and take them out of the pan.  Will make these again, for sure! thanks!

These were delicious! The only change I will make is, next time I will melt the butter and mix graham cracker crumbs first and definitely pour milk over top. My crust fell apart where there was not enough butter. Overall, everybody loved them!

I have been making these for as long as I can remember around the holidays. These were definately a staple in our house! We did, however, use a slightly different recipe.
We used semi-sweet chocolate and peanut butter chips. This gives it a not so in your face chocolate taste. 
We also used more graham cracker crumbs and packed it to make a thicker crust and poured the condensed milk over that, THEN added the toppings.
If you decide to make these, I highly recommend using the peanut butter chips!

I used these tips from another reviewer:
Tips - Mix the margarine/butter and graham cracker crumbs together to make a firmer "crust". (My family also melts the margarine in the pan in the oven.)
 
 - Pour the condensed milk on the graham cracker crumbs BEFORE adding the other ingredients. It seems to make everything stick together better and it makes it so much more presentable!
 
 - Use more than 1 cup of chocolate chips.

I made these today for a camping trip we're taking this week. I used about 2 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs to make more of a sturdy crust. I also poured half the can of milk over the crumbs and the other half over the top once everything was in. They came out great. After cooling for an hour they cut easily and look really great. Thanks!

I've been making this recipe for at least 50-years, and everything here is correct EXCEPT that the condensed milk is poured over the GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS and then the chips, nuts and coconut added. DO NOT put the condensed milk over everything at the end!

Delicious and very easy to make!  I decreased the coconut to 1 cup and added 1 cup peanut butter chips. I even used FF sweetened condensed milk because it's all I had. Will definitely make this recipe again because it uses things I normally keep in the pantry.

This is a can't miss recipe! I used two cups of graham cracker crumbs and combined them with the butter to make a firmer crust. Used pecans because I prefer them to walnuts. I used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips which may have been overkill, an overflowing one cup is probably perfect. These are delish! Will definitely add to the party dessert rotation.

I grew up calling these "hello dollies".  a good basic recipe.  I mix chopped pecans, coconut and chocolate chips together to get even distribution.  I melt the butter and mix it in with the graham cracker crust and then press it into the bottom.  pour half of the can of evaporated milk on top of the crust, then add the coconut mixture and then add more evaporated milk on top.  it is ALWAYS a hit and if you make it for people who have never had it before people will think you are a culinary genius.  ;)

This is a great recipe, but I make some changes and get great raves every time.  For the crust I mix together the graham cracker crumbs and 3/4 cup coconut (processed fine in a food processor) with the melted margarine or butter.  For the chips I substitute a 2-cup mixture of the milk chocolate, white chocolate, and butterscotch chips.  I sometimes drizzle caramel or sprinkle the caramel chips on top.  With the chip flavors made now you could try other variations as well.  Try it!

This recipe is very sweet and addictive. I was introduced to it by my college roommate, whose family has been taking it to get-togethers for years, and the pan is always devoured. However, she mixes all of the ingredients together so the result is like a brownie/blondie square. It is REALLY good this way too. Just wanted to suggest trying that variation!

These were awesome!  I made them for our New Year's Eve party last night and they were gone in an instant!  I've had many similar versions but this one was so nice and moist and crumbly -- not at all hard or dry or sticky.  This one is a keeper!

THESE are AWESOME!! The only reason the person a few ratings below me only gave it 3 stars is because she didn't follow the recipe at all.....duh!

This was very rich, good and easy. The crust was a little crumbly, so next time I will press it before adding on the toppings.

A favorite of mine growing up--I was so glad to find the recipe again. This is easy and delicious, just don't overcook--undercooking is better.

Love these.  My mom used to make them when we were kids, so I searched and searched for the recipe, and found it right here.  I made them for a bridal shower and had at least 5 people ask me for the recipe, and even more people were asking around to see who made them, then complimented me on them.  Easy to make and came out perfect, just like Mom used to make.

Sweet Moses!!! This was SOOOOOOO GOOD. It's really sweet though. I eyeballed the time it took to bake and it's crunchy on the edges but THAT'S THE BEST PART! As someone suggested, I added oats and used a combination of mini dark chocolate chips, regular chocolate chips and some peanut chips on the top as well as substituted some oats I had on hand for the portion of coconut -- all in an attempt to reduce the sweetness. Also used a smaller tin of milk. It was ridiculously easy to make. It's not the healthiest thing I've ever made but for one tray, I made 16 bars so I could even make it bite-sized. I wonder what would happen if you mix everything together and do a la macaroons? hmmm....

I substituted animal cracker crumbs for graham cracker crumbs. Just zipped them up in my chopper. I also subbed evaporated milk with 1/4 cup of brown sugar (shaken together in a closed clean jar) for the sweetened condensed milk. I used almonds instead of walnuts, as well. Turned out fine.

I throw the stick of butter in the pan while the oven is heating and then mix in the graham cracker crumbs.  One less dish to dirty.  I've also made these with white chocolate chips, cranberries and slivered almonds.  They are always a hit no matter what combo is used.

My mom made this when I was a kid.  I have made this twice so far.  The first time by-the-book, yummy.  The second time I followed the advice and doubled the crust...it rocked.  But I also added peanut butter chips...great.  those two  changes made a great recipe even better.

This is a great simple recipe. I have been using it for years. I accidentally used cinnamon graham crackers. It added a great flavor to these bars. Will probably make them this way from now on.

I have been making this recipe with rave reviews for years. Here are my suggestions: (1) Mix the graham crackers with the butter to make a firmer crust. (2) Use pecans instead of walnuts (3) Add the condensed milk last to help everything hold together better. You shouldn't need the whole can, just most of it. Enjoy!

Just made this tonight and my husband has half the tray gone. I used crushed Vanilla Wafers since I didn't have graham crackers and the flavor was the same. I also used an 9x11 pan and they came out a bit dense but still very delicious. Great easy recipe!

Easy and delicious! Because I read it before and found it helpful: 1 package of grahm crackers will be enough for the crushed amount. I personally like mixing half a bag of chocolate and half a bag of peanut butter chips.

The first time I had these was in 1973 when I went on vacation with my girl friends in San Clemente.  Nancy's mother had made these and left them in the refrigerator for us to have when we got there.  Oh My God, they were so good.  Hers also had marshmellows on top. I got the recipe from her mother, and made them a few times, but over the years, the recipe got lost in moving. I am very glad to find it here.  The other thing that I do differently is mix the butter and crackers together with a tablespoon of sugar - it helps the crust stay together, and the crust is good in its own right.

Great recipe! I used the boxed graham cracker crumbs along with lining the bottom of the 9x13 with parchment paper, which keeps it from sticking (for those who have problems with that). I also added marshmellows to the mix as well. Turned out great!

This is my favorite layered bar as I don't like the butterscotch or toffee found in other recipes. I doubled the bottom layer as well and also, after about 8 minutes of baking, sprinkled marshmellows on top.  This was an awesome addition I definitely recommend it!

These are so yummy.  I like these better with butterscotch chips.  I've also made them with almonds and I liked them better that way, but they are also delicious without nuts.  For the crust I use butter instead of margarine & an extra cup of crushed graham crackers.  They stay together better with the extra graham crackers.  Also, I don't really measure any of the toppings, I just eyeball it, as I sprinkle everything on top of the crust.  Yum, they are so good!

We experimented with these bars. Some of the best variations are 1) graham crust with cherry baking chips, chopped marachino cherries, mini marshmallows and coconut.2) graham crust, butterscotch chips, chopped pecans, mini marshmallows and chopped skor bar.

Can you say YUMMY!  These were fantastic!  As some reviewers mentioned, I also skipped the nuts.  No problem. I also didn't have a full cup of chocolate, so I substituted a handful of butterscotch chips instead (and, while I was at it, threw in some toffee bits). I'm telling you....these were good warm right out of the oven,  and the next day for a little indulgence with my morning coffee.  The longer they set, the firmer they got and they indead were magical!  They almost tasted like a candy bar.  I will have to most definately make these around the holidays for our friends and neighbors.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are rich and delicious and better yet, easy to make.  I did change a few things.  First I crushed Oreo cookies in the food processor until there was enough for three cups.  I mix the crumbs with half a cup of melted butter and pressed firmly into the bottom of the pan.  As suggested, I spread half of the sweetened condensed milk on the crumbs and then added the toppings.  I used chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and a little bit of coconut (normally I hate coconut but it tastes nice in this recipe).  I spread the remainder of the milk once the toppings were in place and baked at 350 for almost twenty minutes.  I added additional chips once I pulled the bars from the over for a nicer presentation.  Even though my husband was desperate to eat some, I waited for at least 40 minutes before cutting the bars.  They were amazing!

I started making these several years ago.  Our FAVORITE combination though is to use all butterscotch chips and slivered almonds.  I use 2 cups graham cracker crumbs too for a thicker crust, chips, coconut, nuts then top with the condensed milk.  Everytime I've taken these to a party or potluck, they disappear faster than the chocolate ones.

They came out a lot flatter then I expected but they were good like that. We left out the nuts and put the milk under the coconut and chocolate chips so everything would stick together better. It worked quite well and had a much nicer appearance. We froze them after the first day and we are eating them straight out of the freezer. We're liking them better cold then at room temperature.

This recipe is always a hit.  We don't like nuts in our baked goods - so I used choc chips, butterscotch chips and white choc chips in addition to the coconut flakes.  After I assemble, I give the pan a slight tap on the counter to settle the condensed milk.

AGREE with the members who said the instructions are faulty - do not pour the sweetened condensed milk over all at the end! It is the FIRST layer after the crust, then you build up the layers on top of the milk.

I followed the recipe and wished I had doubled the crust as some reviewers have said. Also, it was very sticky and did not set, even when cool. The taste was OK. I won't bother doing it again.

thi cookie bar is easy and sooo rich and good. I always include this quick recipe when making desserts for holidays because almost everyone remembers this from childhood.  I have also used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscoth chips which is really good, as well. A must for any holiday platter or tin of cookies!!

I made this recipe for the first time and it turned out awsom. Everyone loved them. I added a crumbled up heath bar to half of the batch and it turned out yummy. I had to double my crust to fit the pan.

Superb!  I mixed the crust with butter and then packed it down.  I also used cashews, which is what I had on hand.  My family can't keep out of them! We're giving to teachers this week for a gift.

This is a great addition to your arsenal of desserts and is good for any occasion with a little modification to fit the mood. I agree the crust would be better if made "one and a half" the amount in the recipe and one can the condensed milk on top of the crust and one on top of the chocolate chips and etc. I switched marshmallows for the walnuts, making this into a yummy s'more bar that is sure to please!

I took the advise of other reviewers and I doubled the graham cracker crust; however, I ended up with a very crumbly crust even though I doubled the margarine too. Should you bake the crust by itself first maybe? Add even more margarine? Otherwise the coconut, walnuts, and milk chocolate chip topping was great! They tasted like those somoa girl scout cookies! Will try to make these again, but will play around with the crust part.

These are amazing. I used the search engine to find a dessert that used all the ingredients I had on hand and this popped up and thank goodness it did!  I mixed the butter and crumbs together and pushed them into the bottom and then topped with walnuts , white, milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips , then coconut and then sweetened milk on top of everything and they turned out perfect. I brought them as the dessert to a dinner and the host wouldn't let me leave with the few leftovers there were lol Which upset my husband and which is why I'm making him a double batch this weekend !

/this is the way my mom used to make them.  You pour the milk over everything where as some recipes do just the crust. I like this way better the coconut gets sweetened this way.

So easy and a big hit!  I read the other reviews and stirred the crust in the pan and packed it down, then poured the SC milk, then everything else.  If you chill them and then cut them with a hot knife they stay together really well.  I also doubled the chocolate and used 1.5c of graham crackers for the crust.

This cookie tasted great...my only problem was that the graham cracker crust didn't form.  I think next time i make this i will make sure the butter and crumbs are mixed (like with a cheesecake) before i add the additional layers.

These are such a quick and easy slice to make that is sure to be a crowd pleaser!

I adjusted the recipe slightly - I used Skim 99% Condensed Milk (it's all I had) and followed the other suggestions of mixing the gramcracker/butter before putting in baking pan.

These were so good!  Next time I'll follow others' suggestion to mix the margarine and graham cracker crumbs together and pour the milk over the crust because my crust fell apart in places that didn't have enough margarine to the crumbs were too thick.

I have tried many variations of this recipe and this one was my favorite.  I stirred the margarine and graham cracker crumbs (1 1/2 packages) together, and assembled the remaining ingredients as instructed (minus the walnuts because my husband doesn't like them).  I also added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips.  Baked 20 minutes and came out perfect!

Ridiculously Good!!!!  Haven't made these in years; so glad I found this recipe again.  I mixed up the graham crackers and butter in food processor, then dump in pan & pat down, and baked about 5 minutes extra so they were evenly golden brown.

Soooooooo yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and these were delicious!  I have been putting off making these and now I am so glad that I finally did.  The whole family loved these.  I made them today and they are already half gone! This is a nice departure from the usual cookies/brownies.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Great recipe! I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Some of the graham cracker crumb did not stay on the cookies when I cut them and placed them on a plate but recipe was still delicious. Tastes sort of like you're having an almond joy cookie bar.

Delicious!!
A few tips:
Instead of margarine use 1/2 cup butter.
Add butterscotch chips to the layer.
Use 2 cups crunched graham crackers for the base.  
Be sure to melt the butter in a separate bowl and then mix the crunched graham crackers completely before adding it to the pan.  (This avoids crumbs when cutting it).
I made this for Easter and my brothers said it tasted like a party in their mouth!  Huge success.  I will definitely be making this again!

I substituted the butter for 4 oz. of non-fat yogurt and mixed it in with the graham cracker crust which cuts down dramatically on fat(over 100 calories less per serving).  I think the amount of graham cracker crumbs should be doubled to 3 cups for more of a base.  Also I put the condensed milk on first and then sprinkled the coconut flakes and finally topped it off with the chocolate chips and then baked until the coconut flakes were brown and the milk color darkened.

Makes me relive my childhood. I have ALWAYS loved these bars. When I make them, I always use butter. You can also get away with using regular milk with a little sugar instead of the sweetened condensed milk.

Mine turned out a little messy but tasted amazing. Maybe needs something a little more to bind them.

this class cookie bar is an absolute favorite around our house! I use all chocolate chips (sometimes a combo of semisweet and milk chocolate) because no one here likes butterscotch. A total treat any season

I made these as a surprise for coworkers (because I'm cleaning out the cupboards and needed to use that can of sweetened condensed milk!) As others recommended, I mixed the graham crackers and butter together (in a food processor) before pressing into the pan, and I actually used two 9x9" pans instead one of 9x13" without changing  the proportions of anything. I used pecans as the nuts, poured the condensed milk over the crust first and pressed everything else into it. It overbaked a little in my oven so the coconut was a little too brown, but it was still pretty good in that salty/sweet/crunchy taste and they disappeared quickly at work.

I loved these bars!  But mix the crumbs and melted butter thoroughly.  I've never seen a recipe telling you to sprinkle the crumbs over the melted butter. For the topping, you can add a little more of one and a little less of another.  It  all depends on what you like.  For mine, I added more chocolate and decreased the nuts.  I also poured the condensed milk directly on the crumb base.  After adding the toppings, I pressed the toppings down gently.  After baking, the bars seemed so soft.  I thought  it maybe didn't turn out.  But it firmed up after cooling.

I will definitely make this again. It was a little soggy, but that was probably just from adding to much evaporated milk. Overall these are a favorite!

I’ve been making these for 50 years. They were my favorite college care package - travel well. The only difference with my recipe is that I was taught to mix everything together (no need for the butter then); they are stiff to mix but you avoid that cloying sweetened condensed milk layer. They stay moist and hold together well. Oh, I do add a little vanilla when I mix the milk in.

Followed the reviewers and put in graham crackers first, then margarine, chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, sweetened evaporated milk.  It was really good.

This is an all time favourite of my family from years ago.  We called them Christmas Bars,  which were our special treat at Christmas.    I definitely would agree with the other reviews that you should mix the margarine & crumbs together.  This bar is definitely a keeper!

They were yummy, but the crust came out a little uneven. I think next time I will mix the butter and graham cracker crumbs together then spread into the pan. Other than that they were really good.

Everyone loves these. This recipe is great. I also like to use crushed Oreos instead of graham crackers when I want to add a different flavor. The Oreo ones always disappear faster than the graham cracker ones.

This was very easy to make, I added 1/2 c of chocolate chips, and 1/2 c of butterscotch chips. I added coconut flakes to the mixture, and saved some to put on top mixture so it was brown. My husband, kids and me loved these! Very rich and yummy.

Very quick and easy. I put a sheet of parchment in the bottom of my pan and the whole sheet lifted right out for easy cutting and serving.

No changes the recipe is simple and easy to make. The results are raves from all who taste it .  I always get requests for more.  This is very rich but great tasting. It is effortless to make.  I can see bringing this to a potluck dinner and being the star of the night.  I made it for my son in the Navy and his fellow officers can't get enough of it. It is there #1 request of all the sweets I make and send.

These bars can hardly help but be delicious, considering the ingredients.  But I completely agree with others that a firmer crust is needed.  I made them exactly as directed here, and found them much too gooey when cut to hold together well.  I will make them again, but will take others'  ideas into account!

its easier if you mix graham crumbs and butter first then push into the pan. I also put the coconut on last so it gets toasted. (I didnt have any milk so I found a substitute using eggs and brown sugar that was amazing)

I followed the instructions but used 3 cups of graham crackers and two cans of milk in the 9x13. Then I read the reviews but I think mine came out great.  I will combine the cracker and butter and press in the pan next time.  I think you can alter this anyway you would like...pecans, peanut butter chips etc.  I loved the coconut in them.  It puts you in the mind of the Girlscouts cookies.  I also used a 1/2 cup more of chocolate. This is GREAT for any occasion and especially for a QUICK dessert!!

I have made these for many years, they are so yummy and addictive.. the only difference I do is I only add the chocolate chips which is milk chocolate and I chop the nuts to small pieces but its addictive that I have to make another batch before they are all eaten up...

Excellent! Have made these many times for years, but just wanted a refresher on the amount of graham crackers and  coconut, etc. I remembered that I always add more graham cracker crumbs, about a half cup additional with a bit more butter and just a few Tbsp sugar. Then if you press it down firmly it actually sticks together. Also I use different nuts, today macadamia nuts and pecans... it turned out extraordinarily well. And finally, I do use a bit more coconut and a bit more chocolate chips. But I use a combination of bittersweet and semisweet, it cuts the sugar a little and you end up with a lot more chocolate flavor. Even though I add extra ingredients, the pan size and 1 can of sweetened condensed milk is plenty. So, this is a great basic recipe that can be modified  to personal taste without any ill effects. :)  That's my favorite kind of recipe!

Great recipe--made my own changes--I poured about 1/4 a cup of butterscotch ice cream topping over the crumbs and then for chips I did half butterscotch and half chocolate chip. Poured the whole can of condensed milk over the top-Awesome!

Just like I remember as a kid!  I poured the sweetened condensed milk over the crust and then layered everything else and THEN took the back of a large spoon and pressed down on it all.  It stayed together that way, as some of the reviewers were having problems with the toppings not sticking.

These are fantastic. I can never make enough. I mix the melted butter and crumbs in a separate bowl, then press them down in the pan. That just seems easier.

These are my most favorite holiday desserts to make.  I however decreased the butter from 1/2 C. to 1/4 C. as I found it too greasy.  I also added one small bag of butterscotch morsels along with it.

YUMMY!  These are really good except I started with too much butter by accident and tried to double them but didn't have another can of sweetened condensed milk.  I tried to use milk and sugar but they came out much more mushy than the others.  They were all good though and I'd make them again!

These were always a Christmas tradition in our house growing up.  We made them a little softer and moister though by mixing 1/4 of a can of milk with the sweetened condensed before pouring it over the other layers.  Yum!

They tasted great, but were very flat and didn't look remotely attractive. A good 'around the house' bar, but I wouldn't take them to a pot luck just because of their appearance.

These cookies are really you don't have to measure the ingredients.  A little more or little lasts does not make a difference.

these cookies were a favorite of mine growing up, so I decided to make them for a party my boyfriend was having with his friends.  They were a hit, and gone within minutes!  Now I am getting ready to make them again for another party, and I am making more just to be safe!  This recipe is great, although I do not use the nuts...no need to guild the lily, in my opinion.  ;-)  A+++

I've made these for years and love them.  I don't even like coconut, but I can't get enough of these.  Try them!
