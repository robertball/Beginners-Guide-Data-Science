My friends and family LOVE this recipe.  However, I found that when you reduce the sugar by half, the flavors become more alive.  I have now tried this recipe using lemons, limes, grapefuit and tangerines...and it is all fabulous.

This is worth the effort. It's much easier to peel the lemons and use the peels than to zest them. Just, make sure you leave the pith (the nasty white part )on the lemons. It will make your Limoncello slightly cloudy and bitter tasting.

I am currently stationed in Naples, Italy.  I took a class on how to make Limoncello, trust me on this, use 1 Liter of Everclear, and 1 Liter of water.  I have talked to people that said Vodka does not do it justice.  We were taught to use a potatoe peeler, you don't want any of the white, it makes it taste bitter.  Other than that, follow the recipe wrt sugar and the time line.  Remeber to keep this in the freezer prior to drinking.

Great recipe! I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups (also 2.5 C of water), and I boiled lemonzest with the sugar/water mix to add a stronger lemon flavor to the whole thing. (Note: leftover lemon syrup is great for flavoring other drinks or making Italian sodas as well)

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a veggie peeler on my lemons, which made this much more manageable. I used organic lemons, since I figured it's the one time where the part of the lemon I'm the most interested in is the outside! After peeling off chunks of peel, I flipped them over and scraped them with the side of my knife to remove all of the pith. The end result made enough for x-mas presents for a few people and some for me to keep as well! My recommendation for drinking this: mix with pomegranite juice or cranberry juice. The flavors work so perfectly together, it tastes like you're drinking candy!

Good if you prefer the 'clear' limoncello. I personally prefer the creamy version and have a recipe from a native Italian that is delicious.

Some suggestion. Since you are using only the outer skin of the lemon, look for organic lemons that have not been treated with nasty stuff.   Look for lemon varieties that have a thick skin and are high in essential oils.  Try peeling thin strips with a potato peeler.  A zester will prematurely release the oils in the skin.  Try to avoid the pith (white part) as this is what causes bitterness.  Also try an alternative sweetener such as agave instead of refined sugar for a warmer palate feel.  This recipe will create a Limoncello that is a little low in alcohol over traditional Limoncello. If you are using Vodka (40% 80 proof) the final alcohol will be less that 20% instead of 30-35%. It will freeze at this proof.  A higher proof alcohol will extract out the oils and color faster. We love Limoncello so much we started a company in Sonoma to produce it commercially.

Limoncello is a really good drink. This recipe has worked 2/4 times I tried it. You have to be really careful to get just the zest or it will ruin it.

Love this recipe, I made a few changes to make things easier for me.  First I poured off just enough Vodka (100 proof) out of the bottle to fit the lemon peel directly into the Vodka bottle.  I then aged this for three weeks.  After combining the simple syrup with this mixture, I poured it back into the Vodka bottle and an emptied, cleaned wine bottle (or two if needed).  I let this age for three weeks as well, then strained.  I think leaving the zest in the mix for the second aging increased the lemon flavor and helped balance the sweetness.  Thank you for providing the recipe, its so much better than storebought.

Try mixing this with Italian Blood Orange Soda for a gorgeous as well as over the top cocktail !  I get my soda at Target but many grocery stores have it.  Put the Limoncello in a tall glass over ice cubes and then slowly pour the soda, which is a dark red orange color, down the side of the glass.  Beautiful color combo as well as flavor....ENJOY !

I love this recipe!  I have chosen to age the Zest a little longer (2 weeks) and then once the simple syrup was added another month.  I have also taken a Vanilla bean or two, slice them open and added them to the second aging process.  It's called Mellocello...fabulous over ice and boy does it sneak up on you!

Terrific and so fun! I made a double batch & gave it for Christmas gifts. I started the process in late October with homegrown Meyer lemons. I too peeled them instead of zesting-wasn't hard at all.  After 3 weeks I strained that and added the lemon syrup (boiled more peel with the sugar and water) I only used 2 cups of sugar after reading other reviews.  I let this sit another 3 weeks and then decanted it.  Everyone loved it at the holidays- and it will only get better as it sits.  Kept a little for me for this summer!

this drink is so incredibly sweet. Is there a mixture that anyone has tried to cut the sweetness? A drink made with the Limoncello as a base? As I have three bottles of it in the freezer, I would like to be able to use it. Thanks in advance for any help.

Absolutely wonderful.  I have a year round loaded lemon tree so this will become a staple at our house.  I adjusted the recipe for a 750 ml bottle--8 lemons, 3 cups water & 2 cups sugar.  Going to try the creamy version next.

The limoncella was good, but it took ages to make.  By the time I was finally done making my huge Christmas batch, I didn't want to try any of it myself.  This is definitely not an endeavor for the impatient or faint of heart!

First time too sweet and too weak. Second time dropped the sugar to 2 cups and changed to Grain Alcohol... now we have a crowd pleaser!

I used a potato peeler to peel the lemons.  I added a few more lemons and used about 15.  Afterwards, I juiced the lemons and saved it.  After the melding process was completed, I used two cups of water and used the other two cups using the fresh lemon juice I had saved.  It gave the Limoncello a very lemony flavor, sweet and sour, and a beautiful yellow hue.  Looked beautiful in bottles and gave as gifts!  A huge hit!  My mother loves a generous splash in homemade iced tea to give it a little kick!  Bon Appetit!

Sorry, but I honestly do not think you you should call this limoncello. Perhaps lemon vodka would be better.  Limoncello is made with grain alcohol, and is a bit of a process to get a great product. To those of you who like this, I suggest you made real limoncello, you will LOVE it!

We all make limoncello in my family. May I suggest the following:
#1 Use Everclear. Unlike vodka, Everclear is virtually tasteless and won't compete with the lemon flavor.
#2 I use a sharp potato peeler and circle around the lemon and usually end up with one long continuous peel. Never zest the lemons!
#3 You want a good 2 weeks of soaking the peels in the alcohol and every couple of days turn the bottles to mix.
#4 Squeeze the lemon juice and pour into an ice cube tray, freeze, then store in a zip lock freezer bag. Defrost a cube or two when you need lemon juice for salad or whatever.
#5 Part of the Limoncello experience is to proudly serve your liquor in a fancy clear or frosted bottle. Patron brand tequila bottles work really well once you get the labels off.
#6 Limoncello competition  in my family can be fierce, and rumor has it yellow food dye gives an unfair advantage lol.

Super easy and wonderful beverage. I used a vegetable peeler to peel the lemons and it was quick. The first mixture filled one one-quart mason jar (I used a 750 ml bottle of vodka, not a liter) along with the peels. Then step 2 with the simple syrup filled two large mason jars perfectly. I enjoyed this mixed 1:1 with cranberry juice in a martini glass - similar to a cosmo. If you like sweet cocktails this recipe is for you. IMPORTANT: Be sure to cool the simple syrup as stated in the directions or your alcohol will burn off - and you wouldn't want that! :)

This is a simpler version of my recipe. My limoncello ages for 80 days but is well worth it. The more it sits the smoother it is. Donot skip on the aging and make sure to keep it in the freezer. Wonderful

Buy and use a Microplane zester - it's the best tool for zesting lemons and making Limoncello!

I've been making this for the past 4 years. I use a potato peeler, too, as it is much easier.  I let it steep in the fridge for a month, stirring occasionally.  Mix with half and half for a creamy drink or pour over vanilla ice cream for a great quick dessert.

I agree that this recipe is a bit sweet, so I just used 1 1/2 cups sugar. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. The extra lemon zest added to the simple syrup is a great idea! So is using a vegetable peeler.  I would also remind everyone that most store bought lemons are coated with wax, so make sure you let them sit in VERY hot water first and rub off the wax. I use 1/2 a jigger of this in my Cosmopolitan drink and also make a sorbet with it. LOVE IT!

We mix limoncello, about 6 juiced lemons, vodka and fresh mint in a quart pitcher with ice.  I never really measure anything, just do it to taste. Shake vigorously, then serve over ice and garnish with a sprig of fresh mint.  

This recipe makes delicious limoncello, but drinking it straight isn't to my personal taste.

Good recipe, but it would be more like an Italian commercial product and better if you use Everclear or any other grain alcohol (95% alcohol) vs 40% for Vodka.

5 cups water to 3 cups sugar is not as sweet and I think a better ratio.

I found this easy and delicious.  I used a small flat hand held cheese shredder.  I have made it twice and also made a small lime test batch.  I did not use glass with corks but old peach jars (and an old sauce jar which had a hint of sauce scent and the limoncello overpowered it).  Next time I will step down the sugar as suggested above.

Perfect lemoncello! I had some in Italy last year and this is even better! Very important not to get any of the white pith in it. I use a potatoe pealer and peal the skin off instead of scraping the pith out. Works great!

I used Everclear which is grain alcohol @ 190 proof so when it gets  diluted it is closer to 35-40 percent abv like it is supposed to be.  Plus I use organic lemons then clean them with fruit and vegetable cleaner before peeling them.  I use a veggie peeler to peel skins so it leaves most of the pith behind.  If you want a more refine clearer drink when you strain off peel use a coffee filter with a strainer to catch the fine pieces.  Then re filter before bottling.  I let peels ferment for 3-4 weeks then strain with filter. Then add simple syrup then let it ferment a couple weeks then bottle. I have also made it with oranges and limes as well they are just as good.  As far as sugar and water some like it sweet and some don't plus depends on fruit bitterness so you may have to adjust to your liking

In reading all of the reviews beforehand, I thought that I had this recipe down pat.  1/2 of the sugar, use everclear, let steep for 2 weeks with lemon peels, 1 week with simple syrup then freeze.  I should have done 3/4 of the sugar for personal preference.  I had to do 1 1/2s time the recipe as I was only able to buy everclear in 1.75L bottles.  I have four lovely bottles of this in my freezer and more than enough taste testers to make me want to start on my next batch.  Let me play with it at 3/4 sugar and rate again!

I'm about to add the syrup today, and will post back after I let it sit with the sugar for (only) a week.  I used limes instead- a fun green color after only sitting for 6 days.  I can drink it as is right now- ha!  Why does the mixture have to sit for so long after adding the sugar?  It's not like it is fermenting it.

This was spectacular!  We will definitely make this regularly.  I didn't use a particularly expensive vodka, but it didn't matter.  Also, I got busy, so the zest sat for almost three weeks before I strained it and added the sugar water.  I used a grater-type zester...took a little time, but was worth it.  I used a 2 quart mason jar for the zest part...that made almost 3 wine bottles worth when mixed with the sugar water.  We're buying small wine bottles and making a couple batches to give as Christmas gifts.  Basically, I was able to make $70 worth of limoncello for about $15.  Great recipe.

Very good, I had a grater that worked perfectly for the lemons(zester/grater by microplane), came out a little too sweet for my taste but still great. Next time I am going to try and find some whole grain alcohol.

So far, the receivers of the bottles I gave as Christmas gifts say that this was good!  The limoncello I've had before was not as bright of a yellow color as mine turned out to be... unfortunately, I'm not in a state that grows lemons - perhaps fresh off-the-tree would have been best.  Very fun to make!

WONDERFUL!!  I read all the reviews and so for the first batch, I used grain alcohol and 1/2 the sugar.  It was WAY too strong and not sweet enough.  Second batch I made exactly according to the directions except instead of water, I used the juice of the lemons I peeled and added enough water to make up the full liquid.  Oh yes, I peeled with a veggie peeler and it worked great.  This batch was wonderful!  I wouldn't change a thing except I would use the juice of the lemons.    I've never tried limoncello before, so I have nothing to compare it to but this was great!  I have a friend who's Italian, been to Italy and tasted it there.  I'm going to have her try it and get her opinion.  I will  re-post after her taste test. Thank you Michele for a wonderful recipe!

I've made Limoncello many times, can also use Lime or Orange, whatever is available and most reasonably priced.
Changes I make because my family love Lemon ... is 4 cups water, 4 cups sugar and 1 cup of the squeezed lemon juice:  pulp, seeds and all.  I only use a lemon zest, any white will ruin the sweet tart aftertaste to bitter!  I throw everything into my 4 Litre container right off the bat, and let it stew a week or so until the flavor is right!  Strain and bottle, storing in the fridge ... transfer to deep freeze before serving!

Absolutely loved this! After returning from an Italian vacation, I regretted not purchasing any limoncello to bring home. This recipe pretty much duplicates the limoncello I tasted in Sorrento and Capri. I put it in the freezer and serve it right away.

The recipe in itself gives correct indications for making limoncello in general, but here are a few steps to seriously up your game.

Already, you shouldn't "zest" the lemons, since it requires pressing them, grinding the peel and basically pouring part of the  essential oils out of the rind, which are what gives the limoncello its incredible flavor (more oils in the rinds = better limoncello flavor). Just peel the rind as you would an apple or a potato, make sure you get little to no white pith on them, and just put them in the jar to macerate.

Second thing: a week of macerating is good, but you can get a better limoncello than the store version by *really* waiting. Between a month and three months of the rinds staying in the vodka will let the oils completely mix to the alcohol. Don't fear for the rinds, they won't rot or go bad. Just keep the bottle in a dark place (as long as it's out of direct sunlight and about room temperature).

FInally, you probably shouldn't go directly for the amount of sugar and water recommended by the recipe for the sugar syrup. It's a good way to make a sweeter limoncello, but it also may be way too sweet for some people. As Emma Christensen puts it: "You can play with the ratios of water to sugar. Start with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar, taste the limoncello, and add additional sugar syrup gradually until you reach a flavor you like — up to 4 cups of water with 4 cups of sugar. More water will dilute the alcohol base, making a less alcoh

While I'm not an expert on limoncello, this isn't anything like Pallini, which is my gold standard.   It is too thickly sweet, not lemony enough and not potent enough.  It won't go to waste but I will try another recipe next time AND use Everclear.  I will also use peels instead of gratings.  I used a vanilla bean as recommended by a reviewer and while not bad, I didn't like the color tinge or the lack of citrus kick.

the Recipe works, However I have to add some common sense and flavor here that I found to be an upgrade in luxury so to speak. 
I add one half of a fresh split Vanilla Bean to the Vodka and MEYER lemon Peel stage. 
then I can not see any reason not to use the juice from the MEYER from 10 lemons you will get just about 2 cups of juice, (its not as acidic) I incorporate this floral juice into my simple syrup (meaning I use it then only 2 cups of water and 3 cups sugar) then continue with the layout of this Recipe. 
 you will really enjoy this.

I think you have to use Everclear/grain alcohol, not vodka to make a true Limoncello. Give it even more steeping time, (4-5 weeks) for the best lemon flavor. This helps to create that cloudy look you see in Italian made Limoncello. The shorter steep time works and it's extremely tasty but that's why it isn't as cloudy.
It's easy pizzi! Perfect aperitif for a cool fall evening and a wonderful gift for Christmas!

Cut the sugar in half. Nice!! Can't wait to try it with oranges. Definitely peeling the lemon skin is the only way to go.

This was VERY sweet.  I would agree to cut the sugar by about half for a smoother drink.  I used a microplane zester for all the lemons and it went very quickly.  I'm going to go with 4 stars, with the sugar cut down this would be very nice, as is, it's crazy sweet (even for me!)

This is incredible! Thanks for the recipe. I started outwith grating the zest. My arms started hurting, so I did what another reader suggested and lightly peeled the rest. It was time consumming, but worth it!

I made this and it turned out great, however, I did make a change or two.  After reading a few reviews about using vodka, I chose to use Golden Grain so it wouldn't have a vodka taste.  I also let the lemon peels sit in the Golden Grain for 40 days.  I then strained it and added the simple syrup mixture and let it sit for another 2 days.  I poured the limoncello into cute bottles I found at the store and put them in the freezer.  My friend went to Rome and I asked her to taste their limoncello and compare it to mine.  She said mine taste just like there's did in Rome!  I am very happy with this recipe....  I'll try making meloncello next.

This is a very good recipe.  Does anyone know why you boil the syrup 15 whole minutes?  Or why it says to not stir it?  Both seem to extend the process.  Its summer you know.  I hate to heat up the kitchen.

My neighbor & I made this recipe and loved it. We followed the instructions pretty closely (we added the zest of a couple of additional lemons), and the flavor was excellent; it has a nice lemon flavor, not boozy at all. We used Eureka lemons from my neighbor's tree. For the vodka, we used Tito's. I have recently been to Sorrento, Italy (the home of limoncello) and this recipe was as good as or better than any of the many limoncello's I tried there.

I use the zest of 6 large lemons, & 3 cups vodka, let steep 7-10 days, then add simple syrup. But basically this recipe...I tried making it a TINY bit less sweet, and it made it more refreshing for after dinner in the summer. I never had "real" limoncello, so I can't compare. But this is very nice on occasion!

I made this and followed direction, but some of the bottles (actually most of them) ended up with a brown foamy, yucky stuff on the top and stuff floating in it.  Any thoughts?  I filtered it through a coffee filter, but am afraid to drink it.  Anyone have that happen to them?  My sister made a different recipe and her’s did not do that.  HELP!!!

You should use everclear grain alcohol for this recipe. You'll have much better results. Also when buying lemons make sure that you buy only organic lemons! You don't want pesticides in your limoncello. Washing them won't remove it completely and scrubbing them will remove essential oils.

I discovered this refreshing nectar on a recent trip to Italy.  It was very simple to make.   This recipe is much sweeter than it's Italian neighbor.  But it's still very good!   I cut the sweetness by adding 1 cup of citrus flavor vodka to the finished batch.  It cut the 'syrupyness' and gave it quite a punch!  :)

Decent. Too sweet. Next time I will look for a recipe that calls for Everclear instead of vodka and that also includes milk.

This is my first time making Limoncello. I wanted to try the Limoncello cake. I kept the lemon zest (part 1) for over 2 weeks. Then I made part 2. I just tasted it! after mixing the two, before letting it sit at room temperature for 2 weeks and it tasted good!!! Can't wait to finish this process and chill. Maybe I won't use it for that cake, or maybe I will make another one for the cake! so easy. But time consuming of course. Update: so the limoncello is done and I guess I just realized I do not like limoncello!! I'll give it to my sister who says she loves it :)

I agree with using the Everclear instead of vodka and reduce the amount of sugar to 2 cups. For the person requesting a less sweet mixed version, I love pouring about an ounce of the lemon cello into a Champaign flute and then filling the glass with a dry Prosecco. It’s my favorite special occasion drink (and I keep coming up with more special occasions).

I've used lemon peels before, so this wasn't new to me. The zest doesn't match up with peels in flavor, and ease of prep.  I'll stick with the peels.

I give this recipe a rave review for ease of preparation and flavor.
The syrup is not too heavy or overly sweet. The yellow color was just right. I was proud to give as a Christmas gift to friends who were delighted and gave rave reviews for flavor.

Excellent Recipe! I cut the sugar by 1 cup as I like my Limoncello a little tart (and use Organic Raw Sugar which comes across sweeter than refined sugar). 

Pro Tip #1: Invest in a really good quality, super sharp vegetable peeler and use that to "zest" your lemons. The results are the same but it saves you a ton of time (and your knuckles!) It needs to be VERY sharp though, so you don't get any of the white pith under the skin.

Pro Tip #2: Buy good quality Vodka! If you cheap out on the Vodka, your limoncello will not taste nearly as smooth.

This recipe will work with anything really.  So if you want home made Galliano (Vanilla Liqueur), Amaretto, Cherry Liqueur (or Kirsch), etc. this will work! Just make sure you strain it well into your storage bottles.  this can be used to replace "Extract" in recipes as well, so makes a fantastic gift for the baker and cook in your life! And the leftover lemons can be juiced and the juice kept in a tightly sealed bottle in your fridge for lemon curd, hummus, Any recipe calling for lemon juice, or your favourite boozy lemon cocktail (think Lemon Gin Collins!)

Your batch of Limoncello will only be as good as the lemons you use, so purchase Meyer lemons if possible. The longer you “steep” the lemon zest, the better the lemon flavor. I usually give it 30 days. If you can not use the best lemons, buy your Limoncello at a liquor store

Do not use Vodka which has sugar already in it.  I used Everclear instead.

I had a recipe from someone in Positano, Italy and misplaced it.  I was able to use this recipe but I substituted a liter of Everclear (grain alcohol) for the vodka.  I also used organic lemons just because.  Meyer lemons are also good.  The simple syrup was what I needed the most.

I cut back to 2 cups of sugar. I scraped the white stuff from the lemons and used whole peel.  I let it sit 5 weeks in a cool spot with no sun. If gives it a more intense lemon flavor!  Very refreshing mixed with 7 up!??

I made this for my sister and best friend for Christmas one year. I let the whole, zested lemons sit in the vodka for six weeks. It really made the lemon flavor come through. I strained the vodka and squeezed the lemon juice out as well.

I use a half and half combo of 80 proof vodka and grain alcohol. I make 3L and adjust the lemons and sugar for this. 
I have also made a batch where I have put 2 vanilla beans into the mix of alcohol and lemons. The Vanillacello is a big hit.

I ended up zesting the lemons to get the most oils from the peels. That makes a "cloudy" Limoncello which you want. I'll try it with Everclear next time and use a tad less simple syrup.

Excellent, but here's a much faster method. BTW lemons have pesticide residue so scrub them under running water before zesting.  Meyer lemons are amazing for this! (Peel is much thinner so use a sharp razor knife to avoid getting white pith, which is bitter.) 
Into an ISI half-liter whip siphon, put all lemon zest and a good vodka to the fill limit. Charge with NO2 cartridge. Let it sit for at least 2 hours. Overnight is better. Slowly release pressure with the whip upright and a glass over the nozzle and another below to catch any spray.  Proceed as directed in recipe.  Store in freezer and serve in frosted shot glasses.

Excellent Recipe. Have tried Limoncello here and un the Amalfi coast and this is a good one.  Ensure you substitute the vodka with Everclear. Also be careful when pealing the skin of the lemon not to include the white pith of the lemon.  

I used 151º proof Everclear and used the full recommended amount of simple syrup and it came out great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great but potent.  I made it with everclear and Meyer lemons, I also added the lemon juice in with water to equal the cups of water and put in all the sugar.  It is absolutely amazing and tastes just like the ones I drank in Italy on the amalfi coast.  Can't imagine it without the juice.  Can't wait for another batch of Meyer lemons.  We peeled the lemons and scraped off the zest. Time consuming but absolutely a necessary step.  Had some a friend made who skipped scraping the pith off and it was so bitter it was undrinkable.

It turned out delicious but it wasn't cloudy (didn't get the Ouzo effect) which is typical of traditional Limoncello.
