the flavor was ok, but the texture no... I make a lot of zucchini bread this time of year.. this one sounded good...  it took 10 minutes longer to cook, the top never browned any, it was way too dense â€¦  The Birds liked it....    I will stick to my recipe I use, and if I want it to have the lemon flavor I will add it. ..

It was easy to make but hard to resist. Both my husband and I are diabetic so I substituted sugar substitute for the sugar.  I used agave  instead of the sugar.

My granddaughter and I made this for dessert last night for our houseguests and it was a total hit. My brother ate three servings!! Everyone put this in my bake often box. In my house, that's a huge compliment.

I did not have cornstarch so I had to double on the flour amounts and I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup it called for....came out amazing!

This is VERY tart!! I should have realized it when the sugar and lemon juice are equal amounts!! The cake topping was delicious.  At first I was very upset thinking I wasted 7 cups of blueberries but then told my husband to lift off the cake part and just sprinkle more sugar on the blueberry part.  Would I make this again? No.  However, I like the almond milk idea instead of regular milk.

I haven't made it, but would like to.  I'm not really a baker and would like to use coconut flour.  Would that work?  Thanks in advance.

Okay -- I made it with regular flour.  Never have I ever made a cobbler.  This was AMAZING!!!  Now I want to make a cobbler every week.  Fresh ingredients and the almond milk probably helped my baking skills.  I've been inspired.
