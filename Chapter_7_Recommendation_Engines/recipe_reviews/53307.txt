To counteract the "mushiness" complained of by a previous reviewer, I simmered the potatoes and cauliflower together for about 20 minutes. Then I added the squash and garbanzo beans and simmered for 10 minutes.  This decreased the cooking time by almost half to prevent the veggies from becoming mushy.  However, the stew was far too spicy, to the point hubby and I weren't able to eat more than a few bites. (If served over rice like an Indian entree, this amount of spice might be acceptable.) Also, the texture of the squash seemed incompatible with the other ingredients and didn't seem to belong. Recipe sounded delicious but needs some big adjustments.

I loved it!  Based on other reviews, I cut the spices in half and it was perfect, but I don't like anything too spicy.

I had fresh squash and just put it in with the potatoes.  I also added some garlic to the onions because I like garlic :-)

I also added 2/3 cup quinoa for added protein and nutrition.  

I'd say this is a new top favorite of mine, especially as I am trying to limit my meat consumption for health reasons.

This was a huge hit at a party I had in the fall, and when I asked my boyfriend what he wanted me to make for Valentine's Day dinner, this is what he requested!  Don't  make the potato pieces too small or they break up - I like to have the texture of the potatoes, so I'll remember to make them a little bigger next time. Also, start with a potato masher on the garbanzo beans - it will speed things up and then you can use a fork on the ones the masher didn't get. The stew is quite spicy but my crowd seems to like it that way - serving over rice would probably help if you don't like this much spice.

Thoroughly enjoyable, and extremely easy. I ate it over whole wheat couscous with a few raisins sprinkled on top. I'm curious to see what some coriander and cumin might do to the recipe for next time--it really is JUST curry. But it's a great start!

This was REALLy good.  Next time I think I will add some raisins and sliced almonds in the last step. Just to add a little sweetness to it.

This is a really delicious way to use up fresh farm produce.  I cut back on the potatoes and added extra summer squash (because I had a lot).  I also cut up a half of a fresh cayenne pepper instead of using the dried.  The only change I would make is to decrease the amount of liquid a bit (by about a cup).  By the time it thickened up nicely with that amount of liquid, the vegetables were a bit too soft.

I substituted mushrooms for cauliflower, and added shrimp closer to the end. Also added a splash of milk and honey to cut down on the spicy (because spicy, it was!). Not sure it needed the shrimp, but the stew was delicious over rice.

I really liked this recipe.  After reading some of the reviews I tried mixing and matching some of the ingredients others had used so....I also substituted mushrooms lightly sautéed in butter, for the cauliflower and instead of squash, I used a big yam cut into big pieces and I used a vegetable broth to simmer the potatoes and chick peas.  I also cut back on the curry and the cayenne pepper by about half and added one large clove of garlic that I chopped and sautéed in butter then mixed in to the final pot.  I also mashed the chick peas slightly before adding them to the potatoes.  It was a delicious and hearty meal.  My first foray into vegetarian fare which honours one of my New Year's resolutions to transition to vegetarianism.

We loved this recipie! We cut the spices in half as other reviewers recommended, and also added 3/4 Cup of quinoa. I did not have garlic on hand or I also would have added it. Instead of adding cayenne I added a fresh de-seaded jalapeño. This did not come out spicy. My Husband does not like spicy food, I actually added more spices to my own dish. Worked out excellent every last morsel was devoured!

Very bland, maybe my fault 'cause I left out the onion and cayenne (though I added garam masala instead).  Not mushy, though - I mashed half the garbanzo beans and left the rest whole.

I made this last night and DH and I both agreed that it was a great tasting and flavorful vegetarian dish and definitely a 'keeper'!  We LOVED the spiciness and texture.  Mine didn't turn out mushy at all. I cooked yellow crooked neck squash separately and added later but next time, I will just throw it in w/ the cauliflower!  I like the idea of serving it over something...maybe WW couscous?  Delicious and great comfort food for a cold winter night!

this was an awesome winter meal made with things I always have on hand in the winter.  My kids don't often eat winter squash unless it's mixed in with other stuff.  This was perfect!

Spicy and Delicious. As in other reviews, I found that the potatoes did not need to cook quite so long. Also, I added a bunch of garlic. It is delicious, but the plain yogurt makes it fantastic.

this was okay.  the overall texture needed something.
i did not want it to be complete mush, as others have commented on, so i varied the cooking times & steps.  i cooked the potatoes for about 10 minutes, then added the other veggies.  i noticed that there wasn't much liquid, so i cooked them while covered.  this took about 15 minutes, where i then added the mashed up garbanzo beans.  overall, the cooking time was about 30 to 35 minutes, not 55.  once all stirred up & blended together, the flavor was nice, but the texture was confusing to the palate.

Very flavorful and tasty but "mushy" - I added cooked chicken pieces.

This was a good recipe, I just made some minor changes to it!

Left out the squash, honestly, zucchini would be much better! Also replaced the Yukon Gold potatoes with sweet potatoes. 
Added fresh ground ginger, cinnamon, and lime juice. The Greek yogurt was a great addition but the cilantro did not add anything so if you want to save prep, skip the  cilantro!

Flavor was good, but it came out way drier than I expected.  Had to use quite a bit of yogurt just for its liquidness.

We used acorn squash, frozen cauliflower and a different kind of potato.  

This is really good for a vegetable soup/stew.  As with all curries, the food is better the second day.

We decided to put this into breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs, sausage and cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved them and we are looking forward to more leftover burritos tomorrow, too.

Holy , this made so much stew!  When it says 8 servings, these are 8 big servings!  If I were to make this again, I'd cut the recipe down.

That aside, this was good but not great.  I wish that the dish had a little more color to it--it's visually quite boring.  It tasted just fine though.  I would eat this again if I had to, but instead will look for a different curried squash recipe for next time.

We loved it! A great way to use the squash from the garden. I like the heat, but I do recd lots of yogurt and a chocolate chip chaser. B-)
