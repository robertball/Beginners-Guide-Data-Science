Great recipe! Because I'd been baking sooo many cookies, I ended up preparing  the dough and then putting it in the fridge and forgetting all about it for a couple weeks.  Baked it anyway, and it turned out great!  Looks much more difficult than it is...actually takes less time than most cookie recipes.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I give it 5 stars, but I suggest using semi sweet chocolate instead of the unsweetened for the chocolate layer.  I used unsweetened and can detect that in the cookie.  I tried using tin foil to line the pan, but it kept tearing, so I ended up using press and seal.  I greased the press and seal just to be sure the dough was easy to remove.  These are SO EASY to make!  Thanks!!!

Very bland - after I made these I looked at other Neapolitan cookie recipes on this website and found they called for 1 + 1/2 cups sugar. Did like the maraschino cherries but not sweet at all if you follow this recipe exactly.

Just mixed these up and notice the other two neapolitan cookie recipes call for 1 1/2 cups of sugar, while this one only calls for 1/2 cup.  Is this an error?  Oh, well, I guess I'll find out. Just thought I'd alert other people who may be drawn into making these because of the purty picture like I was.

These turned out good flavored but mine aren't as pretty as the ones in the pictures....will maybe make a double batch next time and layer in a larger pan before cutting.  My pink layer was barely there.

These were really tasty.  Just a little sweet and semi cakey. I will definitely make this again

I made 6 dozen of these for my Book Club cookie swap, and got rave reviews!  I used strawberry flavouring, vanilla, chocolate for the three flavourings.
My grandson is asking me to makeover just for him!  Great texture and taste!

This was a nice cookie, but lacked flavor; for as putzy as it was, I'll stick with regular butter cookies.

Really enjoyed these! They are a type of butter cookie. You may need more time to bake them if you cut them too thick. 1/2" is best for the 10-12min baking time.

These were buttery good.  I added extra sugar, about 1/4 c., but they could have used twice what the recipe calls for.  Also both hubby and myself thought they needed more after baking so I made a thin cream cheese glaze and dipped each cookie.  As is, 4 stars, with the glaze, 5.
