I made this recipe using gluten-free flour so that some of my family could enjoy it.  This flour tends to be a little fragile in cookies like this, but the flavor comes out.  I think it needed a little salt, so I'd probably make it with salted butter.   Out of the half recipe I made, I got 36 cookies (so 72 for the recipe), so I'm not sure about the 120 servings.  The amount of vanilla sugar for coating the cooked product was spot on.  This was easy to make and would appeal to those who prefer their cookies a little on the side of being less sweet.  Thanks from one Marianne to another!  EDIT:  My g-f family said that they really LOVED these cookies (including the one who can eat gluten), so I felt I needed to update my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  They can't wait to have me make some more soon!  So YAY!
