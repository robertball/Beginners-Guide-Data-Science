I made this recipe as a marinade using the juice of two limes, about 1/3 cup olive oil, and a teaspoon of garlic paste for grilling four salmon filets.  I was unsure of how good it would be when I tasted it before adding the Old Bay... it was really acidic... but the seasoning made it work beautifully since it had a little sweetness to cut the acid. Just brushed about half of it on as soon as they hit the grill, and added the rest about halfway through cooking.  Light and fresh.... we loved it!

Very tasty.  I did not slice the ginger, but grated it very finely over the top of the fish.  All the flavors work well together.  Will definitely use this again!

tasty! Simple and healthy. My only issue was that I didn't have seafood seasoning and wasn't sure what to use in it's place. So I just used salt, pepper and paprika.

This was pretty good but it was little too spicy for me. Next time I will use less ginger and pepper.

I did this recipe for Faceless Frenzy Endeavor Sept 2013.Followed  recipe exactly with the exception of the skinless salmon. I wish I would have squeezed some lime directly on to the fish as the lime taste wasn't really there, but we did love the ginger. This was a nice change for us. Thx janaluwho

Yum!  My husband I (and one of our boys) really enjoyed this.  I will make it again soon.  I'm also inspired to pair ginger and lime more often.  Love them both!

Very good and easy!  I grated garlic and ginger together.  I also squeezed half a lime on the fish before broiling, then topped with remaining lime slices.  The taste of the fresh lime, ginger, and garlic was perfect. Will definitely make again.

Family raved about this!  I used coconut oil instead for a more tropical taste and higher smoke point, and I used lime slices and juice for extra flavor. Will make again !

My family loves this! I donâ€™t add the pepper because my boys are very sensitive to spice and we find there is enough with the Old Bay seasoning. I also pour some some fresh lime juice over the fish before cooking. I have used all sorts of fish with this recipe and all of them work well.

Tasty... Definitely grate the ginger (instead of slicing) and squeeze a little lime juice.
