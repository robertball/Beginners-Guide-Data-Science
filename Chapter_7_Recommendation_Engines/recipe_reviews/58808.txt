I give this recipe 3 stars as is, but with one modification, it bumps up easily to a 4 stars.  Do not bread the pork!  It makes the sauce turn kind of pasty and it's just not a good texture for this recipe.  If you omit the flour and just brown the pork in a spray of oil, I think this would be much much better.  You can still get the spicy flavor by adding some chili paste (such as Sambal Oelek).  I agree with other's comments that it could use a bit more salt than is in the recipe.  I also think that you can play around with what vegetables you use.  We selected red peppers, onions and bean sprouts and squeezed lime juice over it all.  I'd say if you're at all curious about this recipe, give it a try with the change mentioned above.

I am giving this a 5 star becuase of the changes we made.  1) Don't bread the pork- cut into a 1 inch x 1/8 inch slice, cooking in a dutch oven with the red pepper flakes; 2) Don't use mushrooms- intead we used thinly sliced red and green bell peppers and yellow squash (just because we couldn't find any zuchini), mixed into the pot with the peanut butter and coconut milk and added the meat back into the pot; 3) Don't even bother putting it into a baking dish, we just cooked it right on the stove in the dutch oven; 4) For taste, we used Real Lemon juice and red chili sauce (we only used the pepper sauce on our own plates, otherwise the kids, ages 7 & 5 wouldn't have like it.  We used light coconut milk to save on the fat and did not seem to think it needed any additional salt.  We cooked brown rice with chicken stock and spooned the mixture over top.  This is one of our family's new favorite dishes.  I plan to freeze the leftovers for later since we made 24 servings for that purpose!!!!!  Enjoy.

Excellent recipe, but next time I will either halve the pork or double the sauce - there was little or no sauce to ladle onto the rice, which we prefer. I will also increase the curry powder and add about 1/2 t salt, as there is none besides the beef boullion, and it was needed. The general flavor and ease of the oven prep are great. Thank you, Beckil.

Alright here is what I did.  As I say usually I give the recipe a fair shake but some things didn't sit right with me for flavors. I didn't even read the reviews until after I made the recipe.  I certainly didn't bread the pork..tenderloin is naturally juicy.  I cooked the pork first in a skillet with the lid on.  Then I let the meat rest with the lid on.  Second I didn't add the wine.  Mostly because we are a dry house and I am not big on wine flavor.  Mushrooms? nah..too earthy for this exotic dish...they get lost in all the flavors going on.  Since it was the day before grocery day I didn't have coconut milk in stock so I used a can of evaporated milk and put some pur coconut extract in it (1 tsp) I also added more curry powder, paprika, red pepper, and more peanut butter.  My husband said to feel free to make this any time.  There will be a lot of sauce the point is to put it over the rice. Also dont overcook pork because it is high in fat it will dry out. Like I said before put the lid on and let it rest so the juices dont come out.

I give this recipe 5 stars based on my modifications (I haven't actually made it exactly as the recipe indicates).  My modifications are as follows; first, I use cubed chicken instead of pork tenderloin.  Secondly, I do not bread the chicken, but I brown it in a bit of oil (and add the red pepper flakes later when making the sauce).  I substitute water for the white wine since I never seem to have any in the house.  I cut down the beef boullion to just 1 cube and use only a 1/2 tsp of the pepper flakes so that my kids will eat it.  I up the curry powder to 4 tsp and use whatever vegetables I have on hand (if I don't have mushrooms).  I skip the oven and just let it simmer covered in a large skillet for 30 minutes and it is FANTASTIC!  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

I made this for company, and everyone of us liked it.   The next time I make it, though, I will add more curry and liquid.  The taste was great!

This was pretty tasty - but I did play with it a good bit.  I added salt and curry to taste, and also some cilantro.  I didn't use mushrooms, instead I used peas, spinach, and squash.  Also, I didn't have any crunchy peanut butter, so I used tahini instead, and added some brown sugar.

Something else I thought while making this - most indian food would not use a beef product (bouillon cubes), right?

I make this often exactly as directed (except I double the sauce because we're little piggies).  I cut the pork thinner but that is just preference.  I follow the ingredient list and process and we love it.

This was good, but it did require a few modifications to enhance the flavor so this is why I am giving it only 3 stars.  I didn't flour the porkchops since I didn't want my gravy too thick.  I also seasoned my porkchops in season salt, black pepper and curry prior to frying. I added fish sauce and a tbsp of brown sugar to the sauce mix and substituted water for the wine.  Served over hot rice and squeezed fresh lime juice on top. YUM.

Soooo good!  I 've made it twice, and didnt save any for my mom (oops).  I reduced cooking time by using my electric pressure cooker instead of oven.  i cooked the pork and sauce for 8 mins, instead of in the oven.

This was good.  I didn't bread the pork and baked it in a dutch oven with the lid on which helped preserve the amount of sauce.  I added some lemon juice and a few splashes of fish sauce to give it more flavor.  Turned out great and a wonderful meal for a cold winter evening.

I added a tsp of salt and doubled the curry powder, added a 1/4 tsp each of ground cumin and cayenne, then added a heaping spoonful of vindaloo paste. Also added fresh tomato and red pepper from the garden. I asked my kids what they thought and they both liked it.  One said, "It needs to be a bit spicier!"

At the suggestion of others, we omitted the flour and everything turned out very well.  We also added more red pepper and garlic than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again.

Nice recipe but I am more accustomed to Indian curry so the flavors were very mild but blended nicely over rice.  I used smooth peanut butter and skipped the flouring of the pork.  Also, I seared the pork first.

I made this last night and it turned out great!  I wouldn't use as much flour next time, ended up throwing so much out.  I skipped the mushrooms but used a red bell pepper.  I'll tweak it for our tastes but Well Done and Thanks!

I agree that the recipe needed more salt.  I would also eliminate the flour, as it ended up too pasty with not enough sauce.  I threw the leftovers out, which was a shame considering how expensive pork tenderloin is.  I won't be making this recipe again.
