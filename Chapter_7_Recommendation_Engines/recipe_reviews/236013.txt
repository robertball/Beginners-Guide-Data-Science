Changed it up a little: layered rice on the bottom of casserole dish, spread 1 cup of sour cream on top of the rice, left out the ranch dressing and the corn in the meat mixture.....very very good!

Easy peasy. No one left hungry. 

Easiest gut filler out there. Add hashbrowns for even more leftovers. Didn't taste half bad, either! Added peas, onions, carrots, and greenbeans into the mix as well.

(Used about half the ranch that it called for... and it was still very ranchy. Would not advise using the full amount unless you want to swim in ranch)

So nice to find an easy-to-make, inexpensive, healthy recipe which my kids actually love!! I used half the salsa and half ketchup; and half the ranch dressing and half sour cream. So fast and yummy!

Giving this 5 star for how it's advertised to be....quick, easy, family friendly meal.  Took others advice and used half sour cream and half ranch.  Used lime and shredded cheddar as topping.  Husband ate his over tortilla chips.  As a warning....this is not eye appealing!  If that bothers you, I'd plan on mixing it with the rice and rolling it up into tortillas to serve.   ;)  I sent this to my two college aged kids to try because of how fast and easy it is

Very tasty and super quick. I used chopped garlic, threw in onions and jalape√±os and switched the ranch to creamy Parmesan dressing (cause it's all I had). Came out delicious!

I was really surprised! It doesn't look pretty when it comes out, but it really tastes good! I used low fat ranch, and next time I will use quinoa to make it healthier, but we really enjoyed this and it is very quick! Will make again!

My family is lactose intolerant, so I did a 1 for 1 swap of coconut milk with a dried pack of italian dressing mix instead of the ranch dressing.  It was still very creamy and flavorful.  I'm glad I doubled it.

This was a delicious and easy meal. Be sure to add salt, it really makes it better! Also, I put the cheese on top after cooking it because it didn't really explain. Turned out great!

The only problem I see with this recipe is that it doesn't say how much cheese and whether you should mix the cheese inside or put it on top.  I also added 1 onion and 1 clove garlic to the meat when I browned it.  I put about 1 cup of cheese on top and melted it.  It tastes good and is fast and easy.

I did not have corn in the can, just added garlic powder and italian seasoning and hot salsa which was an error although it was delicious but to hot. I am making it again today and will add mild salsa, oh and I added macaroni. No rice. Loved it

The only substitution that I used was half ranch and half sour cream. This dish was just ok...the kids didn't really care for it.  As others stated, it's not the best looking dish.  I'd definitely skip the rice and serve it on tortillas...IF I make it again.

I've made this a few times, and I love it!  But I use black beans instead of corn.  And instead of putting it on rice, I just put it in flour tortillas.  And it really is quick and easy!

I was leery to try this recipe but it was easy so....It is delicious! I made it in a casserole dish with wild blend rice on the bottom. So yummy! I followed others advice of cutting back the ranch dressing, and I didn't have salsa so I used taco sauce. I would NOT omit the corn. We all thought that made it perfect.

I doubled the recipe, using 2 lbs lean ground beef, then sprinkled in some garlic sea salt and black pepper. I diced up half an onion and added that to the beef when it was close to being fully cooked, and I also added a couple squirts of minced garlic. I used one can of corn and one can of black beans (drained both.) I then added about 1.5 cups of salsa, one cup of ranch, and a half cup of plain Greek yogurt as a substitute for sour cream that some others had mentioned using. After it started bubbling, I sprinkled a Mexican style four cheese blend on top. I served it over white rice with warm flour tortillas on the side. My husband and son added sriracha sauce to theirs for more heat. I really enjoyed it and am glad to have leftovers! Thanks for the recipe.

I tweaked it a little. I added more seasonings and used sweet peas instead of corn because I am allergic to corn and added a bag of frozen carrots, celery and onions. Also I added green onions, sour cream and tomatoes as a garnish. My husband called it a Mexican Shepard‚Äôs pie.

Wonderful alternative to boxed dinners, and for the same price. I made the recipe as written for two people and enough leftovers to make it worth two meals. I love the flavors, and everything came through in a tasty mix. Will definitely make it again when I‚Äôm short on time and I need leftovers for the next day.

I fried the hamburger in the skillet and added that to the other ingredients in a 9x13 glass dish and popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350 to heat it up.  I also use only half a cup of ranch and half a cup of green goddess which is a salad dressing for more flavor.  I don't use regular salsa all the time either.  I use totinos orange cheese dip and salsa mixture.

I used bison, doubled the recipe and substituted, as many suggested, sour cream for half the ranch dressing, all to great effect: everybody at brunch loved it. This is a very filling dish, so there was, fortunately, plenty of leftovers. We have found that this dish is good over mashed potatoes, hash browns and toast, as well as rice. Freshening the leftovers with an infusion of more salsa, sour cream and ranch dressing also worked well.

A quick and easy alternative to the usual hamburgers or taco usual I might have with ground beef.  While I had difficulty obtaining garlic pepper, both added in the right amounts serve as a good alternative.  

I also preferred Sour Cream over Ranch Dressing as I'm not a fan of Ranch Dressing on/in too many things.

I didn't think this was a main dish whatsoever.  I ended up grabbing chips and using it as a dip.  Threw some jalapenos in it and served with avocado.  It really is a good base with some flavor but needs a lot of tweeking to make it a dish

I really liked it. Easy, quick, and very flexible. There are a lot of flavors going on in the original recipe, but I could easily see myself experimenting by adding in different peppers, beans, etc. Also, I will probably serve it over a small pasta noodle next time. Will definitely make again.

I used 3/4 cup of ranch.  I didn't have rice (which I thought I had and meat was already cooking) so I used egg noodles and put them on the bottom of the pan, then added the meat and a lot of cheese and baked it.  It was yummy and both my picky children ate it and said to make it again.

Instead of a whole can of corn, I added 1/2 can of corn and 1/2 can of black beans.  Also threw in some saut√©ed peppers and onions.  Big hit at my house!  :-)
