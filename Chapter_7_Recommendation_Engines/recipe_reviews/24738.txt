This recipe is not for a fancy cheese dip which includes gourmet cheeses and special ingredients. There are a thousand recipes for that. This particular recipe is for that fake tasting NACHO CHEESE that we all love. The cheese that we get poured over chips at a ballgame or at the movies. I repeat...this is NACHO CHEESE... as clearly mentioned in the name of the recipe. I am a nacho connoisseur and i take offense when people confuse nacho cheese with cheese sauce or simple melted cheese.  Anyways, I made this cheese, and it gets my stamp of approval as homemade nacho cheese- ESPECIALLY since you can't get nacho cheese tasting nacho cheese from the grocery store- only Costco. Not even velveeta tastes like it. Get to know your nacho cheese, and you;ll understand what i'm talking about- Chef Boyar-G

This is a good "standard cheese sauce" recipe.  My kids said it was not cheesy enough, but would eat it again if I made it.  For Nachos I added a small can of chopped green chilis, it gave it a little kick with out making it too hot.  My kids would not go near a jalapeno if their life depended on it! My kids said the version with green chilis was like the version they eat at school.

I have been looking for a good cheese sauce for a long time and I have finally found it.  This sauce was so good served over broccoli.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best nacho cheeses i've ever had! A bit of mustard gives more zing and colouring the cheese is fun

I only give this three stars because it had a nice consistency, but it really only deserves two because it had no flavor. I even used the sharp cheddar singles. I had to throw in green chilies and taco seasoning to try and give it some life. I think I will stick to Mexican Velveeta.

DELICIOUS. I have been looking for a nacho cheese recipe similar to Velveeta, because here in Australia they eat nachos only with grated cheese, and this recipe is perfect. Love it!

This is wonderful!  I needed a cheese sauce for a recipe.  It deosn't need the salt.  I love mixing it with rice and brocoli then baking it. 
I love this as a dip too!  White American cheese and pimentos is heavenly.[/color]

This sauce was very easy and quick to make.  This is one of the best cheese sauces that I have ever tasted for nachos and jalapenos!
Highly recommended!!

I was very pleased with the consistency of this sauce.  I used 2% singles which didn't have too much flavor, but nonetheless, this was still a good, basic sauce.  Next time I might play around with different cheese to see which I like best.  I served this over broccoli.  Thanks Mary.

This was excellent. For those that who have a hatred or dearth of processed cheese, use 2-3 cups of your favorite shredded cheese. For a little kick, add some Tex-Mex seasoning. Or Jalapeños. Because the ones with Jalapeños are the ones that are ruling.

Very good for an easy nacho sauce, I added juice from a jar of jalapenos which gave it the perfect kick.

This is an excellent cheese sauce!  I think that the ppl that rated it lower had unrealistic expectations.  If you want NACHO CHEESE SAUCE, this is it, if you want Fondue, or to use a tastier cheese than American, keep looking or modify the ingredients.  Putting low stars and saying it's not cheesy enough or it's not gourmet, or it did not have the flavor of your fav. cheese it makes the author look stupid.

We thought this was a good nacho sauce.  I will make again but only for nachos as is intended.  Many reviewers complained of a flour taste--be sure to cook your flour and butter mixture (roux) at least 2 - 3 minutes while stirring constantly; this will cook out the flour taste.

the people who rated this pourly obviously have never been to authentic mexican resturants, with the jalapenos.  This is the cheese dip they use for their tortilla chips.  It is supposed to be thick! If its gets lumpy, you probably boiled it, which is NOT in the directions!

This is a great cheese sauce recipe.  You can use it with any cheese you want.  I've done American, cheddar, mozzarella and brie.  I haven't actually made nachos with it but I've used it on eggs, steak and basically anthing I want cheese on.  1 slice of American cheese = 1 oz of any cheese.

This is a great, basic nacho cheese recipe.  I made some substitutions/additions: I used sharp cheddar cheese.  I added some taco seasoning, hot chili powder, red and yellow bell peppers, jalapenos, and some ground turkey.  Delicious over some Tostitos Hint of Lime chips. :)

If you want to make it gluten free use 2 TBSP of corn starch instead of flour. I also used 1 cup of shredded cheese instead of processed cheese. Good basic cheese recipe

Fantastic! This is about as close to the ballpark/movie nacho cheese as you can get at home, without buying a can of cheese sauce. Very good. I had a little heavy cream on hand that I added in addition to the milk called for - it was a pretty thick sauce. I added several drops of hot sauce and a little bit of dry mustard, but really, this sauce was very tasty to start with. I will definitely use this again for a variety of things. Tonight, tots dipped in cheese. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I really want to like this sauce...but  just can't.  I'm so sorry.  The recipe says nacho, but there was nothing nacho about it.  It was a thick, creamy white sauce with melted, processed cheese.  It tasted like flour sauce on my chips.    I'm in search of a nacho cheese sauce with zing, with a little nibble to it, with some character and dimension.  I never like to say anything bad about anybody's recipes...but this sauce was very bland.  It might be a good recipe for those who can no longer eat spicy foods.

This is great basic cheese sauce recipe.  I made it last night for taco nachos but used 4 slices of american cheese and 4 slices of cheddar.  It was creamy but a little processed-cheese tasting and sweet.  However, today I made nachos and used 8 slices of cheddar and it was very cheesy and delicious.  Last night I added a chopped serrano chile to half of the sauce for my husband and I and that made it FABULOUS!  I think it would be perfect over macaroni for a great mac n' cheese!  Anyhow, this is a recipe to keep close at hand! A++++ (By the way, if sauce thickens too much upon standing, you just need to add a tiny bit of milk and rheat over the stove)

This is a great nacho cheese sauce! I made it as written with the exception that I used heavy cream instead milk, which gave it a richer and a more "luscious" taste. I wouldn't hesitate to add a few extra slices of cheese next time for a cheesier taste. :-) Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing, Mary Ann!

This did the trick! I made mine in the mic. 30sec melt butter, stir in flour, stir in milk, cook 1 min, stir, 1more minute to thicken, stir in cheese, I left out salt. Ideas for future: add taco seasoning, add jalapenos, green chilies, add taco meat etc.

I *loved* this recipe.  I thought it was going to be really hard to make a convincing snack-shack nacho cheese sauce, but this was perfectly easy, and I already had everything I needed to make it.  I've made it twice in the last week!  From start to finish, it took about 5 minutes.  Be prepared that it cools/congeals pretty quickly if you pour it out over chips -- but the texture will stay presentable and it won't last long anyway.  It's not spicy, but it's still very flavorful!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

This was a really good cheese sauce! I only used 2 slices of cheese and about a cup of shredded cheddar (didn't plan ahead and thought I had enough cheese).  It still turned out great, we loved the texture of this sauce.  Served with tortilla chips, but I bet it would be great on broccoli or as a mac and cheese sauce!

A good quick, easy (and cheap!) cheese sauce. I originally made as a "nacho" cheese and was dissapointed. I thought it was too thick and lacking flavor. On veggies, however, it is terrific! MY VERDICT: great for veggies; not so great as a nacho cheese.

I really like this cheese sauce but it does need some heat to be added to it for it to be a nacho cheese, I'm gonna play around with it to find the right heat.

This is a very good nacho recipe.  I found that adding chipotle chedder, mild chedder, and pepper jack cheese really make this the best recipe.  I still added the american cheese slices and the rest of the cheese was added a bit at a time to get just the right taste.

I just made this. Sooo yummy. I halved it and used velveeta and pepper jack cheese, added a little salsa, no salt.

This was OK.  Nothing special.  Hardens very quick.  I still think the big cans of nacho cheese or cheddar cheese sauce from Sam's Club tastes way better than this.  But if your in a pinch and craving cheese, this can serve as a base.  You will have to mix stuff in to serve your taste though.  Its a little bland for my taste.

After a weekend of travel, I decided to chill & make a hotdog bar tonight for dinner.  My son requested cheese sauce to dip his fries in and well here I am.  This is a great sauce, I cut the recipe in 1/2 & ended up using 4 slices of cheese and it was a little thick, so I added a little more milk (skim) and it turned out perfect.  Thanks Mary Ann.

Hands down the best NACHO sauce. Don't skip the hot stuff, it's makes a world of a difference. try adding 2 tsp of Harissa ( Le Phare du cap bon) it's hot paste made with hot pepper, garlic and coriander. Price wise cheaper than jalapenos (a dollar and change for a tube) and gives that perfect heat!

It was quite an excellent recipe. I added a little salsa for spice and texture and everybody just LOVED it. When I first made it, my sister thought it was loaded with salt (because my grandmother who lived with us wasn't allowed too much salt), until she looked at the recipe card, at which point she became surprised that it was made with american cheese, and not package mix nacho cheese, which made her decide it would be good for her, and it was. But i'm starting to ramble. The nacho cheese was a very good recipe, especially with the enhancement of salsa.

Thanks Mary Ann! This recipe worked GREAT for us. I followed it except we added about 1/2 cup Pepper Jack at the end with the chese slices. We used it for broccoli since that is the only way my daughters like it. Very simple, fast and I can't wait to try it with other foods...especially nachos. It thickened really well. The added cheese almost made it too thick, ALMOST! We'll be using this often. : )

I realize that I am in the extreme minority here.  This was to be 'nacho cheese sauce' not 'cheese sauce' for veggies or other things.  Strictly for chips, jalapenos, etc.

I made it just as written and cannot say that it was tasty or overly enjoyable.  Won't make this again but am glad 99% of you like it!  :)

This is sooo good! I'm a sucker for getting nachos at the movie theatres and this cheese sauce is very similar. Also I used velveeta instead of kraft singles.

I poured (yes, poured!) this sauce over broccoli and it was fantastic.  I've been looking for a really good cheese sauce and this is it.  I'm going to try it over nachos and on chili dogs soon.

Great basic nacho cheese sauce.  I sprinkled in a couple of dashes of chili powder for a little more flavor.  Great on tortilla chips, and many other kinds, too!  My kids inhaled this!

This recipe is much better than the can nacho sauce I tweaked it a bit by adding about 1/4 cup of jalapeno juice (from the pickled jalapenos that I love to eat with this recipe) after the cheese is melted and prepare cooked hamburger meat seasoned with salt and pepper to taste and place it in a bowl on the table beside the nacho cheese sauce and tostitos for added flavor and texture.

This was perfect, like other reviewers stated this isn't fancy cheese sauce.  This is the nacho cheese sauce you get at the ballpark!  You can add salsa, jalapenos, or a dash of ground cayenne pepper to give it a kick if you like.  American cheese is a must in this recipe, I tried using some cheddar cheese and it didn't turn out as good.

Delicious! The perfect cheese sauce! We didn't have sliced American cheese though so we added 3/4 cup of Costco's 80/10/10 blend cheese (mostly Mozzerella cheese) and 1/4 cup of Mexican Blend Cheese. It turned out fantastic! Thanks!

I thought this Nacho Cheese had a gritty aftertaste. Maybe it was because I used cheddar cheese instead of American? I liked the simplicity of the recipe though. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was great for the broccoli I had prepared for lunch today.  I actually used cheddar cheese instead of american and was very impressed.  I can see adding chopped jalapenos and hot sauce to it when made as a chip dip.

Consistency and texture were excellent- next time, I'll add some hotness in the form of hot sauce or peppers.  Don't overcook, as it will become thicker with time.   Thanks Mary Ann!

Wow!  This was awesome sauce.  Didn't make any changes and my son loved it.  He loves to make El Presidente's, which are his specialty. But tonight he started cooking and we both forgot that I didn't buy any nacho cheese sauce. :(  So I told him to look up a recipe to see if we could make it at home, and he came across this easy and simple recipe. So much better than store bought sauce without all the extra additives and SOOO much cheaper.  I will never buy store bought cheese sauce again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.!!!! Five stars and two thumbs up.

This is simple to make and is very good. I always use Kraft sliced cheese and add salsa for extra flavor. I have found Tostitos brand salsa is the best tasting in this cheese sauce. I also always omit the salt and I love salt, but it just doesn't seem to need it. I have made nachos for our guests using this recipe and always receive compliments!

This is a great base sauce I made it once as is but we didn't care for it made exactly according to recipe. So now I make just a few changes to zip it up and we LOVE it. I use Velveta for the cheese slices and then we add some jalapeno juice (from the jarred jalapeno rings). This makes it a perfect nacho cheese in our mind! We make it often for nachos. LOVE!

This was a great recipe.  I used white american cheese rather than yellow american and it was soooo good!  The only problem was that it dried out too fast and got chunky.

Easy and delicious! I used freshly-sliced American cheese, and not those gross pre-packaged singles.

After melting and simmering the sauce with 7 slices, my sauce was too milky, so I added 1-2 more slices, which also makes for a thicker consistency.   

I know this recipe is for nachos but if you add a tsp of dijon mustard, it's also good with soft pretzels, and as an alternative to cheese in a ham and cheese sandwich.

This truly does taste like the cheese you get at softball games and other concession stands. It's wonderful. The only complaint is that it was much more liquidy than I was expecting, so I'll be cutting down on the milk to 3/4 cup. Other than that, the recipe was perfect and it only took 15 minutes to prepare and cook. Oh, instead of cheese slices, I used 2 TBS of 2% Velveeta block.

Yeah, didn't care for this at all!  I could taste the flour and it tasted very artificial and I LOVE nacho cheese from the theater and such.  Sorry.

Great recipe! Had to stir in a little more milk at the end to thin it a little, otherwise, didn't change a thing. Also, it took more like 15 minutes, not 25. Will definitely use again!!

I made this for my very picky 10 yr old son and he is a tough critic when it comes to any recipe where he see's milk in it. I made a half a batch for his dinner tonight (nachos) and It was very smooth and creamy.  For me it was a little on the bland side, but that could be easily solved by throwing in some mexican hot salsa or as OP suggest Jalepeno's. (although, I think I'd like the idea of a little more of the tomato flavor along witht the heat, I think I will try this recipe next time something calls for a bunch of Velveta cheeses, I'm thinking Rotel tomatos with green chiles and this sauce and bingo, we are ready for a fiesta!  Nice basic sauce!

Very good!! Instead of 7 cheese slices, I used 1 cup of Kraft Mexicana shredded cheese (A mix of cheddar, colby, and monterey jack cheeses). I also did not add salt. Turned out amazing. Just as good, if not better, then the cheese sauce you get at the movies.  : )  Thanks for a great recipe

I think I didn't add enough salt, and maybe I'd add more cheese slices next time, just for personal taste. Definitely a very good recipe!! Can't wait to try it with jalapeno peppers to make it spicy! Also, I didn't use it all. It congeals a lot, but if you want to use again, just re-heat. Or! Use it as a cheese spread. This is also good for any recipe that calls for cheez whiz or something. Would work great if you're making chili fries!

I liked this recipe a lot. I used 6 oz of velveeta (block cheese) and then I added ground beef seasoned with taco seasonings and then chopped a jalepeno pepper (from can or jar) and mixed into the nacho sauce. It was excellent as is or with other items added. Nice consistency and flavor.  Next time I will use this recipe on baked potatoes with bacon or beef. Yummy.

I do in fact believe, that this is a fantastic voyage through the human orifice, known as the mouth. it was a magnificent flavorful montage appearing in my mouth. Thus, i feal obligated to congratulate you, on your heartwarming discovery, a mix of jalepenos and a substitution of the cheese, to chedder, would be an amazing differencial.

Pretty good stuff...I like that it doesn't get extremely thick after a few minutes (like processed cheese does).  Closest thing to nacho cheese I can find on here.  Would like a bit more kick, but great for what is included....had everything on hand.  Thanks for the post.

Simple and delicious! If you want it spicy, just add some jalapenos or cayenne. This is a great basic nacho cheese sauce that I will be using again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Some people who've posted bad reviews about how gooey and lumpy it is ... my suggestion is to add more milk next time you make it. Also, if it is too bland, add salt. And you could be spontaneous by adding different types of cheese. Common sense people!! It won't hurt to experiment~.
I liked the recipe and will make again. What's great about this is, if you add more milk to it, you can make it into Macaroni & Cheese. Add some onions, a little garlic, hint of dry mustard... Wah~la! If you want to go gourmet... mix together fine dry bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and melted butter together... sprinkle on top and bake for 20 minutes until golden.

This recipe was the perfect base for the perfect ballpark nachos! I made a few changes to the recipe. I find American cheese to be pretty salty already so I chose not to add any salt and we didn't miss it. I added 2Tbl of canned diced jalapenos, a dash of cayenne, 1/4tsp of cumin, and black pepper to taste. It was the best spicy nacho cheese I have ever had! My football Sunday guests went back for thirds!

I've been trying to make nacho cheese for a while, duh wish I would've looked it up first here on the site. This is great for us, I will not buy velveeta or any of the fake artificial ingredients we can't pronounce.  I only wish I would have added less salt or none,the chips we use were salted, and the seasoning for the ground beef had salt in it.  Very happy with the recipe, was looking for the stringy nacho cheese consistency and that's what we got.

This was super easy.  We were out of cheese sauce and family wanted cheesy nachos for lunch so I tried it because I had all the ingredients.  It was good.  I wouldn't exactly say great.  I added green chiles and it added a little taste.  I think withouot them it would be incfredibly bland.  I gave it 4 stars due to how easy it was and it actually wasn't that bad with the peppers.

Don't add any salt.  This tastes just like that cheese you pump at concession stands, but it definitely needs some jalapenos for kick.  I added some taco seasoning which made it taste kind of like Fritos Chili Cheese Dip.  Add some salsa.  This recipe lends itself to a lot of versatility.  If you don't like the taste of American cheese, don't expect to like this.

Just a basic cheese sauce, NOT a "Nacho" cheese sauce. Nacho Cheese Sauce is made with Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper or, Cheddar and Pepperjack cheese.

Great Cheese Sauce! A helpful hint in making cheese sauce... the less heat used, the more stable the consistence will be after sitting for a while.  I also stirred in a bit of cold milk at then end to stop any residual rising heat.

I followed the recipe exactly. But I wanted a hot cheese sauce so I added some hot sauce after trying it. It was great both with and without the hot sauce.

I am HIGHLY allergic to dairy, so when I came to this recipe, I was looking for one I could easily doctor for mac 'n cheese and nachos or whatever I feel like at the mo, lol.  

Anyway, I also can't have soy, and since I use hazlenut milk, in order to keep it from overpowering things, I used 3 parts chicken brother and one part hazlenut milk, or all hazlenut milk depending on how sweet/creamy I want it.  

Since I can't have "normal" cheese, I use Daiya Cheddar Flavored Shreds. 

When I used the sauce for mac 'n cheese, my bros, my bff, and my hubby all thought it tasted like the real thing, so woohoo!!!

Keep in mind, I am not vegan, and for flavor, I use half lard and hald organic vegetable shortening so the lard flavor doesn't overpower, to replace the butter.  :)

Awesome base recipe, works perfect, even if you are allergic or vegan.  :D

God Bless ~Amy

This is close but not quite there without a few added ingredients.  I added 3 additional slices of cheese for a more cheesy flavor, I also added chopped jarred jalapenos for some heat and some finely chopped roasted red bell pepper.  I put the cheese in the crockpot to keep warm made up my ground beef and zesty salsa beans mixture and set up the nacho stand so everyone made there own

The cheese sauce we have been looking for! Added diced jalapenos and some jalapeno juice, along with a slice of sharp cheddar to increase the cheese taste.

AWESOME!  my kids asked for seconds on their asparagus and cauliflower!  The only change I made was that I used 9 slices of cheese instead of 7 (we like things REALLY cheesy) I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I rate the cheese sauce a 3, but the cheese sauce w/ some minced jalapenos a 5.....so overall average of a 4.  The cheese sauce was smooth and creamy.....but not much of a "cheesy" flavor.  The addition of about a tablespoon of minced jalapenos really made this recipe pop.

Excellent.  I layered refried beans, seasoned ground beef and a little shredded cheddar.  Baked till warmed through and topped with this sauce.  We were then just able to dip the chips in it getting layers with every bite.  Served with jalapeno's and sour cream. The hit of the Packers party.

This is pretty good and super easy to make. I made some for chips and then made some another time for broccoli. Made with the orange American cheese, It is similar to the cheese dip at the pretzel stands, which is a plain cheese sauce not the spicy kind! Made with a good white American cheese it is similar to the white cheese dip at the Mexican restaurants. To speed up the process I have,  whisked all the ingredients in a bowl and, put in the microwave for 45 seconds. Thanks for submitting a quick and easy to make cheese dip!

This is the real deal. Now I don't have to spend major $$ at the ballpark or the movie theater to indulge in one of my favorite snacks, nachos with liquid cheese! I cut this recipe in half and used Velveeta IPO (in place of) cheese slices, about 4 oz I would say. I also added a few drops of yellow food coloring to make it look authentic. Lastly, I added a splash of pickled jalapeno juice.

First time making nacho cheese and it turned out great. I used white american cheese and made loaded nachos. Not only did it taste great but it looked great. I had to add a little more milk to make it thinner but that wasn't a big deal. Great recipe, I imagine you can use any cheese you want. This is perfect for fondue.

Yep, like others have said, it's like school lunch cheese.    Perfect for nacho night.  If you make a cookie sheet full of nachos like we do, I recommend making one and a half of this recipe.  Add taco meat and have some sides to sprinkle one top and you've got really good macho nachos!

This was awesome! I used half american and half cheddar cheese and it was delicious. I also added salsa while it was cooking, and we used it in nachos, with refried beans and taco meat and sour cream, all over tortilla chips. I had to add a little more milk before I served it because it had cooked to be so thick. I think next time I just won't heat it for quite as long. Thanks for the recipe! It sure beats Velveeta!

Very good for a quick, simple cheese sauce.  I was able to make it in a glass container in the microwave.  Melt the butter first (30 sec or so on high), then add the flour.  Mix well.  Then slowly add milk, mixing well. Nuked on high 3 - 4 minutes, stopping each minute to stir.  Once the milk was hot, added the cheese, stirring to melt.  No need to cook more once the cheese is in.  Easy, and no chance of scorching!

I made this to dip breadsticks and veggies in for lunch.I can't get my hands on American cheese so I used this strong flavored cheese i had on hand. It came out perfect and was not at all bland except that it started to lose its liquidity after a while. Definitely very simple since I was able to make it even though I'm 14 and lousy at cooking things in a saucepan.

Great basic chesse sauce. Makes the kind of nachos that started at the concession stands.  To all those that said this was bland.  Do you see any ingredients that would make you think any other way.  Give me a break.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was far from too thick.  Hope you enjoy it too.

I followed all directions as stated and it just wasn't exactly waht I was looking for. I even tried adding some different cheeses and salt and hot sauce and who knows what else by the end! But I'd have to say I'll keep searching for a different one.

I have to agree with Chef BoyarG that this was pretty good for what it is.  I liked it.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I will do differently is leave out the ½ teaspoon salt. It is a great base for so many options.  I will serve it in a small crock pot to keep it warm at the super bowl party.  Thanks Mary Ann.

I was craving nachos and had next to no ingredients in the house, but had enough to make this.  It's a good, very basic cheese sauce.  I added hot sauce to mine, and it satisfied my nacho craving!  I think it would need a lot of tweaking to make it something special enough to serve to guests, however.

This is great!  Just what I was looking for -- the kids love this with their nacho chips.  Not too spicy for them, just right. And so-o-o much cheaper than the nacho cheese dip you can buy in the can that you have to microwave.  So easy, teens can make this themselves!

Very good sauce but a little too thick.  I used 2 cups of milk and instead of american cheese, I used about 2 1/2 cups of pepper jack cheese.  This added the spice my husband and I love!  Thanks MaryAnn!

I was in the mood for some cheese sauce to drizzle over my fries, but didn't have any. So I figured I would look on this site to see if I could find a recipe, and I'm glad I did! Very good and easy.

This is a good nacho cheese recipe, but I made some changes just for fun. I made the sauce as directed and added the following. 12 slices of cheese, 1lbs Hamburger that I browned off with diced Onions and minced Garlic. Diced Jalapeños “to taste” and 1-2 tablespoons of the jalapeño liquid. 1/2tsp Garlic powder, 1/2tsp Onion powder, 1/2tsp Cumin, 1/2tsp Spicy Paprika and S&P to taste. My version lasted all of about 5 mins before my family devoured it. Some ate it on chips and some ate it on Tater Tots. My brother even wants me to make it again tomorrow with tacos.

I liked this. It was simple and quick to make. My daughter loved it! I don't really know if the kind of milk you use makes a different - but we use almond milk in my home. And the cheese came out tasting like white cheddar cheese. My daughter is begging me to make this again!

This is a good starting point for a yummy cheese sauce. I used velveta brand (not sure how it would taste with a different brand). I didn't like it as the recipe describe, it almost tasted sweet. After adding green chilis and some tapatio and serving it wIth some canned chili it was really good. Tasted like that convenience store junk that I love but am too scared to eat for fear of food poisoning. Now I can make it at home!

I wholeheartedly agree with the review from Chef Boyar-G. This is that classic, theater/ballgame saucy nacho cheese. I added some Sriracha to give it some heat and it was amazing!

Absolutely wonderful! I was surprised that something so simple would be so delicious. Mine turned out a bit too thick but I didn't really follow the cheese amounts exactly so that may have been why. If you are looking for something a little more original with some more kick I would suggest adding some extra ingredients to spice it up!

I tried American Cheese as suggested and thought it was a good start, so I began to try other cheeses.  The real winner, IMO, is any Jalapeno flavor cheese slices.  You can use Velveeta, Kraft or anyone else and personally I think it comes out the best that way.  Also I generally cut the butter and flour in half or else it can get too cakey the next day.  

But I love this.  I make it all the time with my adjustments.  I'm glad this was posted so I can get the nacho cheese sauce i crave so much

This came out too sweet, and with not enough spice. I'd recommend trying it with different cheese and maybe a tiny bit of pepper.

So easy!  I used 2 (almost 2.5) cups of shredded Mexican cheese.  When it was done I poured in the juice from a jar of jalapeños.  I stirred until it was a good consistency and added just enough to make it perfectly nacho-y spicy!

I followed the receipe exactly and found the sauce to be very bland. I was looking for the type of nacho cheese that you would get with chips at a ball game, or 7-11. This is not that type of cheese sauce.

Super clever!  Kiddo loves plain old cheese sauce on nacho chips.  She loves this!   I cut some tortillas into triangles, fried in 350 degree oil, lightly salted and drained them.  She had a great snack without having to go to the local fast food taco place.  I bet it would be good and kid friendly over veggies, too.  As promised, not fancy, just tasty and quick.

I substituted a cheddar jack mixture for the American cheese. Since it was shredded cheese, I used about 3/4 cup and the cook time was considerably less.

I just made this with sea salt and it turned out great. The only modification I did was add 1/8 cup of water. It was a little too thick for my liking but after adding water it was perfect!

This was good but I thought it lacked in flavor and did not taste like the nacho cheese that you get at a stadium.  I will make again but add spice or something to it.

I really enjoyed this quick little cheesey sauce over some tortilla chips.  I added some pickled jalepenos and it quenched by hankerin' for some yummy nachos.  Thanks for this simple, yet tasty recipe.

This recipe is excellent for a quick nacho cheese fix and I think it would do well for mac n cheese too! If you want a spicier version, add pepper jack cheese instead, along with some hot sauce. It can also be a great, natural alternative to the fillers and chemicals you find in Velveeta. If you really want to get gourmet, sub the American singles for real cheddar cheese slices. My only critique is that it really doesn't need the salt. If you think this is bland then you need to stop smoking cigarettes. 

I put this on top of a baked potato with bacon, broccoli and green onion... so good for anything that needs cheese topping!

This isn't quite the same nacho cheese I was hoping it would be, but it's very close.  I was expecting a flavor identical to the kind of cheese provided at movie theaters, events and so forth; although it isn't identical, it's very close. And very easy to make!

Looking for a sauce to use with the pretzels I made (recipe from this site) and glad I found this. It was super easy and quick to make. The only thing I changed was the cheese. I used this Colby jack shredded cheese mix (all I had)and it was still good. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I didn't have to try this recipe. It is the exact recipe my mom and I have been making for years. We use it as a mac and cheese sauce or great for broccoli and cheese also. I feel for a nacho dip it as little pizzazz. Maybe at the juice from a jar or jalapenos to your taste.

This turns out perfect. Exactly what I was looking for! It's a great base to add flavors in. After I added the 1 cup of milk, I let it thicken and added about a 1/4 cup of dark lager/stout beer. Then added the 7 slices of cheese. I also added 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1/4 cup diced jarred jalapenos. Turned this nacho cheese into Spicy Beer Cheese Dip.

I've been looking for a recipe for my own nacho cheese sauce since the store bought varieties are never kosher. We like a spicy cheese sauce, so I add a bit of cayenne and crushed red pepper.

This sauce is great for a quick mac and cheese.  Just cook up some noodles and mix with this cheese sauce recipe.  Try adding a little dry mustard for extra flavor.

This is a good recipe as you can add whatever you like to it to give it zip and more flavor.   American cheese is good in this recipe. 
Someone mentioned using Velveeta which  is made from Whey and is a liquid left over after milk has been curdled and strained.  Velveeta is a by product of cheese.
I wouldn't think it is as healthy.  I usually avoid it.  Again, it is a matter of taste.  I stick to the more healthier products.

I gave this 3 stars because though it is a nice cheese sauce for broccoli or even pasta it is not a nacho cheese sauce.  I was looking for a sauce that resembled the cheese sauce you get with nachos.  I thought that's what it was going to taste like because of the picture but that's not the case.  The color will be significantly lighter and the taste is that of macaroni and cheese not "nacho" cheese.

As written the recipe has a nice smooth texture and a robust cheesy flavor.   I adapted it by changing out slices for 1 1/4 inch of Velveeta.   Sauteed onion, garlic and jalapenos in the butter and eliminated the salt.   Wonderful cheese.   Definite keeper.

I thought this was just like the stuff you get when you have just tortilla chips and cheese sauce. I had to use 2 extra pieces of cheese to get it the consistency I was looking for but other than that, it was fantastic. Served on top of nacho casserole.

I wrestled with how many stars to give this and finally settled on three, because it has a nice consistency and is very easy to make.  I didn't feel like I could give it more stars because, as written, it isn't very flavorful for a cheese sauce.  I added a chipotle bouillon cube, which helped a bit, but I think it needs the benefit of being made with cheddar AND American cheeses.  I'll more than likely make it again, adding the chipotle bouillon and substituting cheddar for half of the cheese.

Easy to make and my 12 year old son loved it. This is great for kids who don't like spicy nachos! I used 4 oz of Velveeta instead of processed cheese singles. I made it first with the singles and it tasted bland, then I tried Velveeta and it was great.

I loved this cheese sauce!  I was looking for something easy that didn't require Cheddar since I didn't have any on hand.  This recipe was perfect.  I followed it exactly as is.  The soft pretzels I made tasted like heaven dipped in this sauce!

Mmmmm... I'm eating nachos right now!  Since I was only feeding myself, I cut the recipe in half and used 4 oz Velveeta, cubed, instead of the sliced.  I also added some food coloring (try 1 drop red, 6 yellow to start) to make it look even MORE like the fake cheese sauce we all love!  It tastes JUST like the nachos I bought at Target a couple weeks ago!  If only I had the ICEE to go with it!  :)

Warning: it's a BIT salty, and I didn't even put the entire 1/4 tsp of salt in.  If you're eating this sauce on salty chips, you might want to cut the salt out entirely.

I made this for my husbands poker night and added some diced jalapenos for kick, the guys all loved it! I kept it warm in the little dipper that came with my cork pot and all I saw this morning was, what appeared to be, a licked clean container! Thanks so much for such an easy, yummy, recipe!

This is a great cheese sauce! One big suggestion though, buy the Kraft Deli Deluxe sharp cheddar slices in the 8 pack. Just use the whole thing. It makes it wonderfully cheesy and creamy. I'm eating it right now! I mixed about 1/3c fresh salsa with it and it made a great nacho sauce. This was definitely worth it!

I thought this was really good, especially with the tortilla chips from Costco, probably the best I've ever made/ate! ;)

Definitely on the blander side, but you can always change this up with different cheeses or by adding peppers and spices while cooking.

This is good but you won't find a strong cheese flavor. I was looking for a 7-11 cheese sauce and this had the texture but not the pungent cheese flavor. I don't like Velveta cheese, so this recipe is worth tinkering with! Thank you!

Made this tonight using all the left-over cheese in the fridge (American, pepper jack, asiago, romano, mozz). I also added a spoon of Tones chicken base (instead of salt) and some green chilies for a little more flavor.  This was exactly like the cheese at the ballpark! Exactly what we wanted!  Thanks for sharing!

I omitted the salt because I didn't feel it was necessary and added 2 tbsp. of the juice from a jar of pickled jalapenos to give it a little kick. I could still taste the processed cheese slices despite the added heat, but it was a decent sauce for so little effort. Very kid friendly!

I found the sauce to be too powdery.  I followed the directions as stated and the look of the sauce was lovely, the actuall tast of the sauce was good, but it was as if I could feel the flour on my tongue while I ate it which definately took away from the enjoyment of the sauce.  If there is a way to make that not happen I would love to know how, because the recipe is so simple that it would be wonderful to be able to use it and have good results.

Love it! Just made it for the family and everyone is chowing it down! I added garlic powder and also dry mustard for added flavor. I also used shredded cheese instead so that the cheese could melt quicker. I also tried adding in some mozzarella cheese because I had some in the fridge. I also added a little more milk to have a thinner consistency. This is an easy and delicious cheese sauce and I will definitely make this again!

Great consistency . . . nice and thick with the added salsa.  But, yes, it is quite bland even when made with sharp cheddar and jalapenos.  Make sure you serve this piping hot over nachos otherwise it starts clumping (I, unfortunately, let it cool too much).

great idea! I have tried using cheddar cheese, but you just can't beat the processed stuff when you are pouring over chips. I added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese, another 1/2 cup of milk, and about a teaspoon of taco seasoning. Yum! I had to make a second batch. =)

A good basic sauce - I've used this base for other things before also.   I tried chili powder, cayenne, cumin, and cilantro...still felt like it needed more.

This recipe was really easy to make, and the consistency of the cheese sauce turned out really well. That said, I found the flavor really lacking. I did not add salt because the sauce already tasted very salty to me due to the singles. Honestly this sauce just tastes like melted kraft singles, because it is. Next time I'll just use a couple of singles and add the rest as normal cheddar, to see if that helps.

The consistency of the sauce was perfect.  However, the taste was lacking.    I ended up adding 2 hands-full of shredded cheddar cheese, a squirt of mustard, some salt and 3 tablespoons of tabasco to give it that bite that nacho cheese usually has.    Over all, this was a good starting point for us.  I will definitely keep this handy as a base when I make this again.

Giving it 5 stars because it is a great base. I made a couple changes but nothing drastic. Used 1 tbsp flour and 1 tbsp cornstarch. Used a shredded mix cheese (mexican type). Used 1 1/2  cups milk instead of 2. Wasn't as orange as the typical nacho cheese but it didn't matter. Could have used a seasoning like chili powder or jalepenos. But that's up to you.

It was alright. First time making nacho cheese sauce, and I thought that it was very blan, and tasteless. I added a little more milk, and that helped make it creamier, and I also added a little pepper jack cheese to add a little kick to it. Other than that, it was very easy to make.

Hmmm, this is just OK but it was sufficient in a pinch.  I had some cheap singles to use up and my husband wanted cheese sauce on broccoli so this recipe did the trick.  He had to whisk it for me because the singles wouldnt melt and we ended up adding approximately an additional 1/2 cup of skim milk because it was extremely thick.  It really didnt taste like anything so I added a few shakes of garlic powder and a pinch of onion powder.

to really add some flavor, I suggest adding a few tsp onion powder & garlic powder. I also added Cumin for a distinctively Mexican flavor-not quite the typical "nacho cheese" you get from a can, but homemade is always better!

I MADE THIS TONIGHT FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND, IT WAS REALLY GOOD......BUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE TO SALTY FOR MY TASTE. SO I RECOMMEND ADDING A LITLE SALT AT A TIME.

I have been craving nacho cheese sauce for months, I'm so glad I found this. I added a good 4 big tablespoons of diced jalepeno's. It was perfect.

Melted easily, the only reason I'm giving it two stars. Didn't taste cheesy at all no matter how much strong cheese I added in, still tasted flourly. Got gluey and clumpy before I even got the chance to get it out of the saucepan. Do not recommend!

So this was good while hot but after it cooled off it was bad. I added way more cheese that the recipe called for because it wasn't cheesy enough but in the end it was just too floury. Next time i'll reduce or even take out the flour completely.

This was really good. I added 2 slices of pepper jack in addition to the american, just for a little kick. Served it over broccoli, and my husband used the leftovers to dip tortilla chips. Thanks, I'll be making this again!

I was very happy with this recipe. The creaminess from the American cheese is great, better results than you can get with "real" cheese I think. I served it with fries, but sampled a bit with a tortilla chip and liked it that way too. It didn't blow me away with its amazingness (maybe just more cheese was needed?), so not quite 5 stars for me but very easy and all the ingredients are basics which I love. I think I will try this with salsa added next time.

You should eat this quickly as it will harden go weird. Delicious when hot. I reccomend adding the same ingredients, but in proportions that you think are suitable while you are stirring. My friend insisted on adding more butter, so it was more of a butter sauce than cheese sauce. It worked out well, as we ate it with cheese flavoured nachos. The sauce brought out the cheesy taste. Will DEFINITELY use again.

This really wasn't anything fantastic. It worked for dipping pretzels, but I didn't really like the taste - I did have to use medium cheddar cheese instead of the american slices, as that was all I had. Probably made a big difference.

Not what I expected at all. Not like the ball park. Too thick. Maybe I did something wrong but it was more like a fondue than nacho cheese. I will not make again. Sorry! The search continues...

Delicious - I was also looking for a "ballpark" cheese sauce recipe, and this one is REALLY good!  As suggested by others, I 1) added a little mustard (~1 Tbsp?) and 2) left out the salt - there's enough in processes cheese to start with!!  It was exactly the taste and consistency I was looking for... highly recommended!

good recipe.I was a little apprehensive because of some its reviews, but it came out nice and creamy. I used a mild Cheddar which turned out fine. I added a bit of Mexican seasoning and that seamed to do the trick.

This is a quick and simple recipe.  The recipes says 25 minutes but we made ours quicker.  My children who are 5 and 3 LOVEd the cheese sauce i consider them to be picky eaters and they ate all their food and asked for seconds.  I think next time we are going to use a sharper cheddar and see what happens.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks Mary for a great cheese sauce. I added chopped black olives, green chilis, diced pimentos and diced jarred jalapeno slices with some of the juice. It tasted similar to the expensive nacho cheese sauce you buy in the jars. The colors of the addition made it look good too. ;) Everyone loved it. Will make again this week for my son's nineteenth birthday party.

Really good, but not as flavorful as I thought. I added a few drops of yellow food coloring to make it look a bit more cheesy. Funny thing is that the placebo actually worked.

i thought this was really good, i made the recipe just as follows and it was not too think, i also measured the ingrediants exactly, if you put too much flour it will get to thick,  4 stars cuz it is a good base, i dont think it tasted like nacho cheese sauce, i added 2T of jalapeno juice, a dash of cumin, chili powder and a little more salt and then it tasted like nacho cheese sauce thanks very good.

I took the suggestion from from another user and made this sauce for the Easy Mac 'n' Cheese recipe on this site.  It was amazing.  I agree with other users, not really the sauce I would use for nachos, but it really was simple and can be dressed up any way you want.  I used velveeta instead of american slices and it was super cheesy.  Rave reviews from the whole family!

very quick and easy and hit the spot.  especially becasue store cheese sauces are so expensive.  I added green chilis and will use jalapeno's next time for a spicier cheese.  We had it on nachos, taco salads, and baked potatos.

It was a great started recipe. I loved the begining concept However for my house hold it was going to be a little too bland. So I thought I would share what I did to kick it up a notch (I love Emeril) First I doubled your recipe because we LOVE cheese then I added about 1 Cup of shredded mexican cheese Oh and I used 10 oz of Velveeta instead of American cheese slices. Then I added about 1 1/2 Tablespoon of Diced Jalapenos,6 teaspoons of Jalapeno juice,and one whole packet of taco seasoning. It did not even turn spicy we had it with some homemade chili and turned it into chili cheese nachos. So i just wanted to say thnk you for your recipe it was a great base!!!

You can use any kind of cheese in this recipe, it doesn't have to be American cheese. I used part of a bag of Mexican shredded four cheese blend, and some Colby longhorn cheese because that is what I happened to have on hand and it turned out wonderful.

This was a very easy recipe for cheese sauce - I wanted something to dip pretzles in, it taste great!  I did not add the recommended salt I only did a shake and then I added some pepper too.  I'm going to make broccoli tonight and use the rest for a cheese sauce - yummy!  Next time I'm going to spice it up a bit with homemade salsa and home grown peppers (you have to love this time of year), I think my family is going to love it!
Thanks for the great recipe - I plan on making this a lot more, with different twists!

Not that great... I'm back to using the store bought nacho cheese in my quest for stadium style nachos.  My family found this to be bland, not very cheesey tasting, and just not that close to what we get at the Philadelphia Flyers games.

A little too grainy for me.  I'll cut back on the flour and add more cheese next time.  I used colby-jack cheese instead.  Sorry, I don't eat American cheese.

Great for Pretzels! Mild Cheesy sauce. Could use a little kick for Nachos though. I appreciated the suggestion to use a little more milk, as this is a thicker sauce that hardens quickly. I will make this often!!! Thank you!

If you're going for movie-theater style nachos, go with this! After reading other reviews saying it was bland, I sprinkled in a good dash of chili powder, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, and a little cumin and omitted the salt...still came out great even though I used store-brand 2% milk singles. Thanks!
Edit* I also use this on veggies and mac and cheese, and will use today with a turkey/rice/veggie dish...yumm!!

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe.  We've made it a ton of times "as is" and other times we've added leftover taco meat or fresh salsa to add a different dimension.  Very tasty!

Excellent and easy - great base for any flavor you might want to add...  Added mild cherry peppers and the vinegar and bit of heat was the perfect addition.  We will be using this base again for many more recipes to come. Thanks!

This was a great base.  I tripled the recipe and used a whole huge block of Velveeta.  It was very bland though, so I added two cans of green chiles, a packet of low sodium taco seasoning, tabasco sauce, and pickled jalapeno juice.  It was the jalapeno juice that really put the flavor over the top and made it absolutely delicious.

LOVED IT!  Lol.  I actually made this tonight just because I was seriously craving nachos.  

The only thing I changed was that I put a little bit of cold water in it while I was baking homemade tortilla chips.  I happen to like my nacho cheese a little thinner.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  The boyfriend didn't want to try it because it didn't come out of a can, but I liked it.  :)

Terrific starter!  With no spices this is a great cheese sauce for mac and cheese.  Add jalapenos for nachos.  I doubled the sauce and added 1 tablespoon of sriracha hot chili sauce (Huy Fong Foods, Inc brand) and tossed it with a mixture of cooked penne and elbow macaroni (what I had on hand) and WOW it made for a nice cheesy, spicy pasta dish.  Very rich, so serve with a nice cold salad and crusty bread, but very filling and easy to do with items usually in the fridge and pantry.  On a second trial (again, a pasta dish) I added some crushed tomatoes for color and flavor.  It's a mild flavor and the color is nice, usable on nachos as well as pasta.  Another success.

As written, I give this 3 stars - I thought it was pretty bland, and not very creamy. However, I feel compelled to give it another star for its versatility - when you experiement with different cheeses, add garlic, hot sauce etc, it really is absolutely fantastic! I made it last night to eat with chips, but I'm going to play around with it today to have with dinner's brocolli and cauliflower. Thanks, Mary Ann!

We used Pepper Jack and Cheddar - about an inch of each and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  It still needs more "zing" to it, but the consistency is exactly the same as the kind you buy!!  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for the tip about NOT boiling it as we always have before and it always clumped!!  No clumps this time!!

This sauce is great!!!  Good bye processed cheese in a box.  I used this sauce over Macaroni noodles to make a quick Mac & Cheese.  I saw a suggestion to use half American cheese slices and half Cheddar cheese slices and it was very yummy! I also added some salsa to the cheese sauce to make it a bit more zingy and thought it tasted wonderful!

Wonderful. Saves me a ton of money, I will never buy Velveeta again.  I whip this sauce up usually twice a week it's so easy and made from ingredients I always have in the house. Great over veggies, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, and of course tortilla chips.

It was ok, but i rather use cheddar for a nacho dip. American is not the right flavor for a nacho dip, or even to use on veggies.

I give this recipe 3 stars for the base of the recipe (flour, milk, and butter). 
To give it the color and consistency I added more singles ( about 10-12 in total) and a 9oz can of "Fritos" cheddar cheese with a pinch of garlic salt and Chipotle salt, with this added this cheese sauce became top tier.

This was a quick and easy.  Easy enough to not buy a jar of cheese sauce.  I love that I can make it in small batches and its just enough.  My kids don't like any spice, so this is perfect for them.  It could use just a little bit more cheese flavor.

5 stars because it’s exactly as awful as it’s supposed to be. We add in a can of diced green chilies to make it more fake. It does not reheat too well.

Very Good! I did a half batch, added black pepper, garlic seasoning, and a couple teaspoons of Trader Joe's Jalapeño sauce. It was the perfect dip for taquitos!

Love this.  I just add a few spoons of diced tomato with green chili, and a splash of the liquid from the can.  It gives it a great flavor.  I use it on breakfast burritos, chicken tacos, soft pretzels...  you get the idea.

I stirred in salsa for more flavor and easier  dipping (for my 5yo and 2yo). Also, I used about half a block of regular mild cheddar cheese. Next time maybe try medium?

This is super easy and quick. The first time I made it, I used the pre shredded cheese as that was what I had on hand at the time.  The second time, I used the block and shredded the cheese myself, it was less grainy but still tasty, bottom line this is good sauce and it is easy. I hope you try it!

Good basic recipe for nacho cheese sauce. I don't like processed cheese food so I subbed 2 cups / 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese and added a dash of taco seasoning instead of salt. Pretty tasty. Next time adding some jalapenos.

It was delicious much better than the canned cheese sauce in the grocery stores. Fresher and better ingredients. I will continue to make it at home from now on. Very simple and it only takes a couple of minutes to make.

Add a little sharp cheddar & it's close to perfect. First, I made 1/2 the recipe to test it. I remembered wrong, and used olive oil instead of butter. Don't do that. I was disappointed with the flavor, so I added mustard, as suggested by reviewers. Don't do that either! Yuck! TODAY, I made 1/2 the recipe as written, but used the 4 American cheese slices I had, plus a slice of sharp cheddar I had. SUCCESS!!! Make a rue with the flour and butter before adding the milk. It was thickening up too fast, so I added a splash of water before adding the cheeses.

So delicious! Was able to wow my girlfriend who loves cheese with a nice homemade nacho dinner. I did double the recipe (better to have more cheese than you need vs not enough haha) added some taco seasoning as another user suggested, black pepper, and a small can of green chilis. Just wow! The texture was amazing, and with a couple add-ins very flavorful and a good spicy but not overdone heat as well. Thank you for sharing, loved the idea of using American cheese. Gives it that nice "fake cheese" taste that you're SUPPOSED to have with yummy nacho cheese. 5 stars from me!

This is the nacho cheese dip like you get at ballgames, not the Mexican restaurant dip. This is a near perfect, yet healthier version. Very good for what it is.

This is a great nacho cheese sauce! It’s was delicious prepared according to the recipe. The second time I didn’t need the salt but added only half. Maybe it’s because I added two extra slices of cheese since my son wanted an even more cheesy flavor and a little thicker texture. LOVE this recipe! Maybe next time I’ll add some spicy salsa to it. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Though this recipe was simple as suggested, it lacked taste. It was very bland to me, so I doctored it up with some japs and spices...but it still had that "floury" cheese taste. The consistency was quite smooth, but it had almost a chalky taste. I give it two starts because this is basically a mild cheddar cheese sauce. It's not that sharp cheddar cheese sauce you get from the ballpark with your $3 nacho chips.

This is ridiculously easy to make (I did it in my microwave)! I love it! However, I didn't use any flour. After my first try, I added some left over taco meat and diced jalapenos, it was drool-worthy! I did the same in a huge crock pot and took it to a party, (probably went through 50+ cheese slices, 6 or 7 jalapenos and a pound of taco beef). I didn't have any left-overs :( Next time I'm gonna try to add some sour cream to keep it more melty for longer. Crock pot is definitely the way to go!

I didn't really like this nacho cheese. It was really thick, waaaaay to rich, and tasted like macaroni. Some people might like this, but I prefer the not as thick, classic nacho cheese that you find at Costco. It also uses flour, which isn't convenient seeing as people (such as my family) can't eat it because it contains wheat. It wasn't kind of horrible.

I poured this over a tater-tot, one-dish supper, which I then topped with bacon bits, chives and a little chipotle-garlic seasoning. This didn't need additional salt in my view, because of the cheese (used Velveeta). It would go great over vegetables, natchos, as mentioned, and as a dip. Easy and versatile recipe!

I made it like the recipe and I don't know what the issue is, but I didn't like it at all. It was definitely too thick, not the texture I was expecting with the title and picture. I tried to thin it out but it didn't work.

This is the first nacho cheese sauce i have tried making, and i won't need to look for another recipe! Tastes just like the real thing over nachos, I  didn't change anything at all. It's so easy to make and we all loved it.

When the directions say "thicken", do it! I had only thickened a little and result was a tasteless sauce with the same consistency as stadium nacho cheese. After I thickened the sauce more by keeping it on medium heat and stirring *constantly*, I had reduced it to a much thicker consistency, which resulted in a great flavor coming out! (It's definitely easier / less prone to burning if one thickens the milk mixture before adding cheese.)

Plain and simple and that’s what I was looking for this time. Just like you would get at a ball game. This could be doctored up to be fancier if that’s what your looking for too. We got compliments and it was all gone!!

This recipe is amazing!!! I made this just one night with my family and it was wonderful.  For me though, I didn't add any salt because i used salted butter, and it still came out perfect. I also added 2 or 3 more slices of cheese, just for my preference. Definitely recommend this!!

The instructions on how to make it weren't very detailed but when I made it using what I knew it came out a creamy thick cheese. It was very good and my family and friends enjoyed it!

Perfect nacho cheese and very easy to make. I added green chiles. It also doesn't go hard after refrigerating. It can easily be re-heated and still tastes great!

Brilliant base recipe for a truly delicious sauce. I used 5 cheese slices, 2oz of red leicester & 1.5oz of white cheddar. I also added 1t cayenne pepper & 1T sriracha cos we love spice. Was perfect poured over wedges, Thank you Mary Ann :)

The flavor is good but when it starts to cool it gets super thick really fast. I had to add quite a bit more milk to thin it it to a proper nacho cheese consistency.

It's an okay recipe, it's basically cheesey pasta sauce.

I wouldn't recommend using cheese slices, processed cheese etc. it totally ruins the taste and isn't that cheesey!

I suggest  Cheddar and Monterrey Jack along with a pinch of chilli powder, tastes just like cinema nachos :)

This recipe was exactly what I wanted it to be: a very bad for you, high calorie, creamy processed cheese sauce. We used it for an NFL playoff gathering which featured a build your own nacho/taco bar. We added a can of mild diced green chili to give it more flavor. Everyone loved it!

I loved the consistency of this cheese sauce but the flavor was kind of bland using craft singles.  The last time I made this, I tried using a jar of Old English (5 oz) and some shredded sharp cheddar (3 oz) instead. The flavor was much better!  Also, the proper amount of salt is key to this recipe.  Add salt then taste and adjust as needed.

I made this with a few adjustments, due to the fact I was short 4 cheese slices and wanted to kick it up a bit for ground turkey nachos. So what I did with the three slices was weighed them and subbed the rest of the cheese (estimating it) with a finely shredded Mexican cheese blend. I liked it a lot, but not loved it, although I can't fairly rate it, since I didn't have all the right ingredients. I eyeballed about a Tbsp of hot dijon mustard (I think I added a little too much) and a little of the jalapeno liquid from some canned jalapenos.  My dad and mom loved the nachos I made, which I added some of the whole sliced jalapenos to, the turkey taco seasoned meat and fresh homemade salsa.  I realized this would make a great cheese sauce for soft pretzels (which I love) also!

I tried with cheddar as opposed to American cheese and it didn't turn out with a good texture. You have to use processed cheese but it's worth it! I usually add a few chopped jalapeño slices too.

This makes an amazing base sauce, perfect for adding spices and peppers of choice to it.  I'm not usually a fan of that sliced cheese, but 1/4 teaspoon of paprika made it perfect!  ^^  I will certainly make again.

I used ghee in place of butter. The sauce was OK. But i think it depends the quality of the cheese slices you use. My sauce came out a pale yellow. Creamy enough. calling it nacho cheese is a stretch.

I found it to be not quite nacho cheese sauce. It had a bit of Velveeta flavor to it. I added turmeric for some color and cayenne for a little kick. I will be experimenting some more to see what spice is missing. It is very close! Thanks for the great base!

Even though this recipe is not for a "fancy" sauce like some people say, I changed the cheese and it worked out perfectly for me and my family loved it! I used what cheese I had which was about 1/2 lb mozzarella and 1/2 lb mild cheddar (because I doubled the recipe). I also added a little paprika and seasoned salt for a little extra flavor to bring out the cheesy taste and a little extra milk at the end so it would be creamier.  And if you want to spice it up you can add chiles, peppers or your favorite hot sauce.

This is a good base to start with, but definitely double or triple the recipe for a large group. And add more cheese since it needs more cheesy flavor because the recipe is all flour and milk.

Good except we replaced the cheese with freshly shredded Colby Jack, Muenster, Parmesan and Asagio blocks. That's where the real flavor come from ;)

This cheese sauce went fast at our Daytona 500 Party. I'll add some cayenne next time for some kick.

Did not work with Velveeta cheese. The cheese got dry and thick quick and was not melty or liquidy at all.

It is exactly as described: a basic "Stadium Cheese". Cook your rue for a good 3 min. Add the milk 1/3 cup @a time to avoid lumps. I cooked the milk down a bit too much so it was really thick (my fault). We are this w soft pretzles. We liked it but weren't wow'ed. It pretty much tastes like Melted Kraft Singles.

When I made this dish it was a little blan so I made a few additions. If you want a little more taste add some shredded Mexican cheese into the pan and keep stirring. I used a handful. And added half the amount of salt it originally called for and I like my dipping Cheese a little thicker so I added another tablespoon of flower. Overall it as a very good dip

Turned out well. Used Kraft singles, but I also added a few other ingredients. Half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and sriracha sauce. Great texture to the cheese sauce and it didn't last long.

It just tastes like melted American cheese. I tried it as is first and then added a chopped up Jalapeno pepper, then salted it more, and it still isn't even close. If I was looking for a cheese sauce for like broccoli, it would be 5 star.

This is a good, basic cheese sauce. I used cornstarch instead of flour. I used 8 oz of shredded cheese. And I added about six drops of tabasco sauce once the cheese was melted. I served this with some homemade soft pretzels, and everyone loved it. My kids especially liked that it wasn't too spicy. If it had just been hubby and I eating, I would have added some jalapeño peppers to spice it up!

To me this sauce is for Mac n cheese..not nachos...not enough taste...I added some dried hot pepper, some garlic powder, it zipped it up a bit..you could also add the small can of diced green chiles or jalapeños ...makes much better cheese for nachos

Very bland, tastes nothing like nacho cheese. If you are looking for something like the kind of nacho cheese that you get in a ballpark, which is what I was after, this is not even close whatsoever. It wasn't inedible and I did eat it, but very disappointing.

My daughter loved this. I thought it was a little bland but for those who don't like spice this will be perfect.

I tried it, used sharp cheddar as opposed to cheese slices, and added chili powder and ground red pepper to flavor it with. Might adjust the recipe to use less flour and more cheese, cause the sauce really tastes like it could be a roux-based cheese gravy.

I made this again to see if some of the suggestions in the comments helped, and they actually did. Still used sharp Cheddar and some chili powder and ground red pepper, but this time I used two tablespoons of corn starch as opposed to the flour and it came out much better than it did before. Yes, to those reviews saying that if it tastes like flour, then you should cook it longer, but there are people that happen to have a more sensitive palate and taste more of the flour even after it's been cooked thoroughly. I myself have been making roux-based gravies for decades now, and the result was I tasted flour. There are perfectly valid substitutions that do help a recipe out and don't detract from the original.

For those that happen to be getting lumpy sauce, the trick is to add the milk slowly and continuously stirring. It's like a gravy in that regard. The more you stir it, the less lumps you'll have.

This is a super-easy cheese sauce that is great with tortilla chips!  My family loves it.  I love how easy it is to make and that it is made with ingredients I always have on hand :)

Yummy - Just Oozing with Creamy Cheesy Goodness! 

I make a Veggie Pizza with Ranch dressing on Pita bread & this worked great for an alternate Cheese topping.

The main reason I wanted to try this recipe though was for my kids, so they would stop bugging me to take them to the convenience store for Nachos! Geez.

This Cheese sauce is perfect for the base of the dip but it needed something more so...adding a lil' Jalapeño juice would've probably done the trick but I wanted more than that (nor did I have any on hand - we're not a spicy family).

I decided instead to add some garlic, cumin, taco seasoning, & mild Picante sauce.

The kids (and Mom) wound up liking it even more than the store's dip, plus I'm saving money too!

Mission Accomplished and then some.

I have been making cheese sauce like this for a long time, but I use cheddar cheese instead of American. I also use it on broccoli, cauliflower and other things.

AWESOME! Followed the recipe exactly. I was a little concerned with how much flour was in it because I didn't want a congealed, gloopy, cheese sauce. The cheese turned out smooth, creamy and delicious! Just the right consistency. Used it in a nacho bar at a party and everyone loved it! Definitely my go-to recipe for nacho cheese.

Would have been 5* however I'm quite practised in making a rue but I followed this recipe against my better judgement and sure enough I got lumps! It probably should suggest that the milk is mixed in a bit at a time to avoid getting lumps. I also couldn't find any American cheese slices being from a small town in the uk but I substituted them for dairy lee cheese slices which are white and slightly tasteless in comparison so with a little help from a touch of Parmesan and Mexican cheese wow was amazing brill recipe for measurements really morish  and addictive very happy with it my partner made me hide it cos he couldn't stop eating it.

I love this recipe! We wanted a nacho cheese recipe to replicate the type you get at the cinema! This actually beats the cinema one! 
Since making this I have adjusted slightly and now I add a little cayenne pepper and also some jalapeno pepper slices which have been blitzed in a chopper. Delicious!!!!

This recipe as is, is a good basic sauce. I thought the flavor was mild and with trying different cheeses and such, you could keep it simple or do a whole lot more. TY

Pretty good! While I don't think this tasted *exactly* like the nacho sauce at the movie theater or ballpark, this was yummy nonetheless. Admittedly, I did lighten this up a bit (fat-free milk, 2% cheese) so that is likely the reason my sauce wasn't as tasty as it could have been. Either go all out or go home on this one. Make this with the GOOD stuff. It's that simple. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mary Ann. You made nacho night extra special!

Wow, what a disappointing recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was just...not good. Not awful, but not good. It just tastes like American cheese, period. I guess adding chiles or jalapenos would have given it a much-needed kick--but I wanted to try to recipe out as-is, and it was just meh. Also, the second it was no longer molten-hot, it got strangely thick and gloppy. Not a keeper.

Very good but it needed kick to be nacho.  I grated half a jalapeno pepper into it and added a dash of black pepper and some red chili powder to give the kick we like.  It was a hit, I will be making this with broccoli in the near future.

Halved the recipe and since I live in Canada we don't have american cheese slices so I used 2% singles. It was ok but not the movie theatre nacho sauce I was looking for. I'm guessing the american cheese makes or breaks this recipe.

Very good. I used piggly wiggly brand with much more success! A shake of jalapeno powder added depth to it, but I could still serve it to my kids. I can imagine you would save $ doing this, rather than buying cheese whiz or velveeta. I added ground beef cooked with taco seasoning to make a meal. A keeper!

Gets the job done, but really salty and not like the cheese sauce I was hoping for. Will use this again until I can find something better tho, as we always have cheese slices on hand.

I use this cheese sauce all the time for just about everything:  Pour over broccoli or baked potatoes, mix in with noodles for mac & cheese, and of course for cheese dip.  Add some green chilies and HOT salsa for better color and flavor.
I've made this at least 30 times.  I LOVE IT!!!

Came out perfect the very first time! Super good and super easy. I did out in a dab of yellow mustard after reading one of the reviews. It was the perfect with homemade sesame grissini.

I liked the consistency of this sauce but did not love it.  I used cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses instead of American and like other reviews felt that it still needed a little something. Not cheesy enough.

This IS NOT the cheese dip you find at gas stations, concession stands, movies, etc. Not by a long shot. It was awful. I made it exactly as called for, and while the consistency was correct, there was no flavor, almost like a plain Mac and cheese sauce. Afterwards, I tried jalapenos,  cayenne, and chalula seperately and nothing helped. This was horrible.

I read all the reviews and made accordingly. I used a mixer as it cooked to avoid said lumps. It burned a bit on the bottom of the pan so after I gave it a good mix. Some of the burnt part sufaced and was incorperated into the sauce so my pic is a bit speckley. I didnt give it 5 stars because a skin formed as soon as I transferred it into another bowl. Still good though. Similar to the nachos you would get from a bowling ally. I used it to make cheese fries for my boy after he watched Fred3. He craved them! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious and addicting! Very simple and easy to make! It was a hit at my last party and disappeared right away. I really liked the creamy texture and I'm tempted to use this cheese sauce for other dishes, such as mac and cheese.

I'm rating this recipe loved it but I did make quite a few changes to it - just adding spices, leaving out the salt, etc. Next time I'll be adding even more spice since it was still a little bland but I want even more of a kick to it! (I was going to add a little can of green chiles but was OUT! Next time I'll add them or maybe some diced jalapenos!) 

Definitely a great starter recipe for someone to play around with and do whatever you want with though!

I just finished making this and I loved it! I'm forever craving nachos and now that I have this recipe it's a little dangerous;) I did how ever tweak it a bit I added about half a cup of cubed cheddar cheese and 4 kraft slices but next time I wont add as much salt other then that this recipe was quick and easy.

This is a great base recipe. It's very easy to add lots of different ingredients to personalize for your own taste. I personally liked it the way it is, I would definitely eat it on chips. My husband thought it was kind of bland so we added a jar of salsa and shredded pepper jack cheese, and it was amazing. This is definitely going in my recipe box!

I am on the fence about this. It had the consistency of a queso dip, but had no flavor at all. It was good.. we ate it all up once I added some left over chili for a kick. It just didn't have any flavor on its own. Next time I'm going to try real cheese and see if that helps with the flavor.

This recipe didn't work well for me; i don't know, i was expecting a better flavor/taste.  It was easy and all and not bad, just not for me. Maybe it was just too bland.

A bit too salty. Next time I'll only add 1/4 teaspoon. I didn't use process cheese. I used a medium cheddar, with a bit of Gouda. I served the cheese sauce with homemade Mall Pretzels, that I made from this site.

I loved this recipe.  As the original recipe it would be great for veggies/mac'n cheese.  For myself I didn't add any salt(there is enough in the cheese, & dietary restrictions).  With the addition of red and green tabasco sauce, an extra cheese slice, and a couple of squeezes of prepared yellow mustard it rocked as a nacho cheese sauce.  

I read in a review something about being runny.... this could be because the person didn't use the right and/or enough cheese.  The floury taste goes away if you melt the butter and add the flour and cook it by itself for a minute or two before adding in the milk.  
This is a great basic recipe that I will keep using now that I finally found exactly what I was looking for in a cheese sauce recipe.  Thanks.

Bleh, way to bland and the consistency gets really weird after a few min of being out. It served its purpose but I think I will keep trying for the perfect nacho cheese that uses realish cheese.

This was so good and so easy to make, even my husband could make.  I used sliced cheddar instead of the processed stuff but even shredded would work well.  We had it with nachos and it was good!

Sauce had a bit of a grainy texture even after reducing the amount of flour to 1 Tbs.  I used 4oz of shredded sharp cheddar and added a bit of hot sauce to give some more flavor.  Delicious!

This is a good base recipe. I modified it based on how much I wanted to make and the consistency that I desired by adding more/less cheese and milk. I used shredded sharp cheddar and slicess of white american, added some chunky salsa, and a little chili powder. Yum!

This recipe was quick and easy... Due to my dairy allergy, I used soy butter and milk and 2 cups of vegan cheese. I also added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles. The sauce turned out great!

MADE HORRIBLE NACHO CHEESE, BUT WONDERFUL MAC&CHEESE!!!  
I made up some pasta to go with the remaining cheese sauce (see below's comment), and it BEATS VELVEETA!! I'm never going back to boxed Mac & Cheese again!!
This was good, but it was almost like a cheese soup. I used 2 Tablespoons of butter, 1 cups of milk, 6 slices of American cheese, and around 5 Tablespoons of flour. It's going to take me a while to alter the recipe enough to make "nacho"cheese and not cheese soup...

I had high hopes from the reviews that this would be a great base for a nacho cheese sauce. The use of American cheese in the classic sauce base is a good idea, but in my opinion it fails to deliver. It's okay, but not above average.

This was a decent cheese sauce as written.  I found that it wasn't cheesy enough for my taste though, and I used a more expensive brand of cheese slices.  Nonetheless I poured it over brocolli and cauliflower and the kids ate it up!

This was easy to make and I've replicated this technique many times to make other recipes "cheesy".  I was looking for a recipe that had the nacho cheese sauce similar to that fake stuff you get over the nachos at the movies - this is a great substitute and I love the fact that I know it's cheese.  I'll always use this when I can.  Thanks!

Not bad, not great. Better with Velveeta-style cheese. Much better with some seasonings, also. Very basic, which has its own merits!

This is perfect. It's on a fairly regular basis that I like to have this kind of cheese sauce for homemade mac and cheese, broccoli and rice, or a cheap and easy dip. This costs, like, 1/4 the price of store bought nacho cheese, and it has so much less sodium (especially if you nix the salt in the recipe). As far as earlier flavor complaints go, I recommend adding about a tablespoon of white sugar, plus the previous suggestion of a little yellow mustard (I used a small squeeze - about 2 tsp.). Awesome snack idea for this: 1 package of store bought frozen tater rounds, seasoned with taco seasoning and baked as per package directions, then use this sauce for a dip. Fantastic snacking! Wonderful recipe, Mary Ann!

Made as per recipe only omitted the salt.  Cooked the flour in the melted butter 2 to 3 minutes before adding the milk.  Added 1 tsp hot Chinese mustard for a little depth of flavor.  Turned out excellent served over tortilla chips with jalapeno slices.

Sorry, but this was really tasteless.  Perhaps using regular cheddar cheese would be good, but the processed slices just ended up tasting bland.

the consistency is great for easy nachos. a little bland without an extra spice, so I recomend the jalepenos, green chilis or 1/4 cup of el tapatio or tabasco sauce to give it a slight kick. very popular with the kids...even our toddler!

Very Yummy! Tastes just like nacho cheese sauce at the stadium - but better and more cheesy! For those of you watching your calories/fat intake - I used 2% American cheese and 1% milk. It was fantastic! I also sauteed some morning star farms crumbles with taco seasoning (always mccormick) - it was such a great combo! Have it with some jalepenos, shredded lettuce, and sour cream and you're set! But even just this cheese alone with chips is out of this world! Yay! Thanks for this great recipe! :)

This was very good on my tortilla chips, you can also use it on cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and tacos. If you like spicy dips add 1 tsp. of hot sauce and 1/2 Tbsp. of chili powder. Although I never knew that nacho cheese was made of American cheese. However there is a lot of fat content.

I made this last week and I think the cheese was too overpowering. I think it was just the type of cheese slices I used, so next time I will play around with that. I would think the better the cheese you use, the better the sauce would turn out. Nonetheless, this is definitaley a keeper and I will make this again. We used it to make chili cheese burgers and fries and it was fantastic!

This recipe is very good. The only thing I changed is I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and the jalepenos to the sauce at the end. I like things spicy.

I wanted a cheese sauce similar to what you would buy in a can and this was it!  The mixture didn't thicken enough for our tastes, so I dissolved some cornstarch in water, added it to the pan, and brought to a boil for great taste and consistancy!

Loved it. I was trying to find a recipe to copy that would get me close to nacho sauce from a sporting event or @ Taco Bell and this was pretty close. I used Velveeta and added some Frank's Red Hot to taste to spice it up just a touch. The first batch disappeared quickly and I had to make more. :) Also, I served it in a small dip crock pot to keep it warm which worked really well.

This was the best cheesy cheese sauce I have made! It was such a huge hit with the family. I used it over homemade pasta and vegetables, and the kids even ate it the next day!! I think though, If I have to double the recipe I would do half of it with proceesed cheese and half brick cheese and add some worchestershire sauce and tobasco sauce. Thanks so much, great recipe!

It was great cheese to use for macaroni. We doubled the recipe and added half a taco seasoning packet and a slice of swiss cheese just to mix it up and it was delicious! Cheesy, smooth, and lovely! Would make it again for nachos, cheesy bread, or to put on fries or hot dogs.

Made this for my husband's broccoli and he thought it was really good. He wanted me to just use cheese whiz but I told him I wanted to try this recipe, and good thing I did, I saved money, all the ingredients I had on hand. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the directions weren't too clear to me, was I suppose to stir the whole 15 minutes?? And I had to add milk to it when reheating. So overall, not the easiest but very good taste!

Wonderful!  A cheap and better tasting alternative to store-bought nacho cheese.  Plus, I usually have all these ingrediants on hand at all time so I all I need are the chips!

I added cumin, black pepper, extra salt (because the cumin sweetens), and chili powder to add over Nachos.  Turned out well.

I was looking for a healthier version of velveta because my husband was craving nachos.  This was great.  I made half of it for him with the processed American cheese and didn't think it could get better until I made mine which was with Fat Free Cheeder cheese and it was awesome!  I'm hooked!

This was really simple and easy. It wasn't griddy for me at all. In fact it was very smooth. What affects the flavor is the cheese you use. So try different varieties if it wasn't good the first time and if you want, add some of your own touches. This also taste a lot better mixed in with some macaroni then on nachos. :)

This is not too bad, easy and inexpensive as all ing. are usually on hand so in a pinch it seems great for a veggie or soft pretzel topping, I also tried white cheddar and it was pretty good too.

was pretty good. I didn't have the american cheese so I used sharp chedder cheese (2 C.) and mixed 1 Tbs of corn startch, and 1tbs of flour in cold milk. It was fine but a little watery because I added another 1/2 cup milk. After it cools it tastes a lil grainy. I will try adding less milk next time and take out the flour and add another Tbs of corn starch. YUM!

AMAZING!!!  We were on the hunt for that lovely fake cheese sauce that they serve with your chips at the ballpark, and this is IT!  I didn't have any American cheese around, so we used a combination of mild Cheddar, low-fat Cheddar, and a little bit of sharp Cheddar... totaling about 2 cups, I'd say.  The key to this is to taste, taste, taste!  You'll know whether to keep adding cheese or if it's done.  We served this as a dipping sauce for the Buttery Soft Pretzels from this site, and it was to die for! Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I added some drops of hot sauce at the end to add some spice. Never would have expected this to come out so good. Even re-heats great! Just like being at the hockey game! If you don't get great results, check your cheese.  I used good thick slices of yellow american cheese food (not product.)

This recipe is a keeper. I made it like it told me to but I decided to do half american and half sharp cheddar. WOW! Everyone in my family loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it got really thick while standing. I will have to add more milk to the sauce. You must at least try it if you are looking for a nacho sauce. =)

It was pretty good, but not as good as I expected. It was missing something; I added a bit of mustard to try get the flavor that I wanted. It helped a bit but there is still something missing. I guess I will have to experiment a bit more next time.

Excellent sauce!  I made it with sharp cheddar instead of American (not a fan of American cheese) and it was fantastic!  We had chili cheese tots and the sauce is very similar to what Sonic uses.  This is a keeper!

My fav local Mexican place serves something called a soft cheese taco. Never understood that, it's a cheese enchilada with cheese sauce if you ask me. Anyhoo, I used this sauce for a homemade version of the same. Skipped the salt and added a dash of garlic and onion powder. Pretty darn close. I will definitely be playing with this, maybe add a touch of jack next time.

Delicious cheese sauce! While cooking, however, the sauce did not thicken until after blending in the cheese and simmering for quite a while. Served it over a bed of restaurant style Tostitos Nachos! A repeatable snack!

This was the best nacho sauce I have found. I added a small amount of mustard and a dash or two of cayenne pepper and it was fabulous. Excellent dip for soft pretzels!

This was a pretty good standard cheese sauce, nothing fancy, but it's good for whipping up some quick nachos for lunch or a snack. I forgot to add the salt.

Was looking for a base recipe for cheese, that I could tweak to our likings. Perfect base, but as written it would be WAY too bland. I used white american cheese slices, doubled the recipe, used FF 1/2 n 1/2 and added diced green chiles and diced jalapenos! I have also Rotel diced tom w/grn chilis or jalapenos before. I have added meat as well. Basically, this recipe is a good starting poinT! These GO great with the buttery soft pretzel recipe on this site.

Great starter recipe for a million and one cheese sauces. I used white cheddar cheese slices and added jalapenos, crushed red pepper and then mixed it with left over taco meat for what I call "drunk nachos".

I thought this was great and easy.  I only had 3 slices of cheese so I added a good helping of shredded colby blend and it was still turned out fine.  I used it in the Nacho tator tot recipe from this site to replace the can of nacho cheese it required.

Actually about 4 1/2 stars.  I used about 7 oz of velveeta as I was out of American slices.  I added a tad more kosher salt and then jalapeno relish to give it some zip.  It was pretty good, basically it's what "it is".  I will make it again with American next time and will use this for those nacho cravings. Definitely will experiment with it on my bbq nachos!

EDITED:  I did make it with yellow american cheese, think I'll try it with white american and green chillies to make a white cheese dip.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, following ALL instructions TO THE LETTER. The sauce was PERFECT! I took it to a potluck Mexican dinner and the kids and adults alike proclaimed it outstanding! It is a simple nacho cheese sauce that was a wonderful complement to the taco salads, tortilla chips and enchiladas that others brought. I will make this again and again!

We brought home the little bit of leftover sauce, warmed it up later that day, and enjoyed an "encore presentation" of those yummy nachos.

Please note that the directions are very specific about how and when you combine the ingredients, and that it takes CONSTANT attention and stirring to get the consistency right.

Great for that processed-cheese-sauce craving.  Don't use this as some gourmet cheese dip - it tastes similar to jarred cheese sauces or the kind you get at ball games.
I stirred in salsa to the milk mixture, and next time will add some chopped jalapenos as it was still a tad bland.
I'm thinking topped with ground beef would make a nice dip for a crowed.

A great base to play with...I made the recipe as written but needed to add a little more milk to thin the cheese out.  After tasting the original recipe I added some taco seasoned ground chicken and black beans.  Those additions added some extra flavor.  Next time I may add some salsa or diced jalapeno...I'll also play around with the cheese, perhaps a white American instead of yellow!  Overall a great start and super easy...my roommate approved!

I didn't care for this, but my husband thought it was very good, so I gave it 4 stars. I thought it was a bit bland as written. I was looking for a recipe more like the ones you get at baseball games, sauce with a kick. If I make this again, I'll have to add some spice to it.

It was pretty good. I added some garlic powder, jalepenos, and crushed red pepper. I like that I controlled the ingredients over something like velveeta.

My 9 year old daughter loves nachos so I decided to try this for her. She likes the flavor but said it is hard to eat because it so thick. If I make again I will add more milk.

This was actually really good for how simple it was.  I gave it 4 stars because it was pretty bland.  I added some enveloped taco seasoning and salsa and it came out with more flavor, and it looked a little more authentic.

I LOVE this recipe!!!! I made it for a fundraiser at school last May and my nachos were the biggest hit!  I admit, the cheese sauce was kind of bland but I hate spicy food, so it was perfect for me. For the pot I served at school, I added some mild jalapeno juice, about 5 teaspoons full. This recipe is great because it's soo flexible. lol I'm even making it for a Thanksgiving treat!

This was just "ok" for me.  I like that its creamy, but I needed to add some sharp cheddar and seasoned salt to give it some zazz.  
Pretty good over nachos.

I have been looking for a nacho cheese sauce for my husband. I substituted 1/2 powder cheese for the real cheese. Not the best, but I'm sure it taste much better with real cheese.

This is a tried and true recipe when you use Land Of Lakes Bulk American cheese found in the Cheese section of the butcher case.  I shred my own and use quite a bit for that "cheesy" taste.  Great with cauliflower and other veggies.  Great for potatoes too.

Very nice. I used this last night over a big gooey plate of "deluxe" nachos. I took another reviewers tip and added a bit of cayenne pepper to it. I also subbed a bit of velveeta in place of 3 of the cheese slices. Thank you for posting.

Absolutely Wonderful!!!  We cut the recipe in half, then added only two slices of american cheese slices and a cup of shredded medium cheddar cheese.  We also added garlic powder, onion powder and a little pepper to taste.  Would have been perfect for serving with veggies or having with chili dog as recommended by other reviewers.  We added 1/4 cup salsa....YUM!!!  Wish we would have had some cilantro on hand to make it perfect!!! : )  This recipe is already a family favorite...so simple that my sweet husband (a beginner cook) was able to make it work first try.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

Really easy to do.  To help kick it up a notch, I add a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper (or chili powder) and some chopped up jalapenos.  Tastes great over broccoli!

We used cheddar cheese in place of American cheese. The consistency was perfect. It was bland as other readers said, but we ate it on nachos with guacamole, bean dip, sour cream, and pico de gallo, so it was delicious and perfect! I will try to post the picture.

I was craving nachos last night, and this did the trick.  However, I think I just used this recipe as a base.  I didn't have any American cheese on hand, so I used half pound of velveeta(may have been too much, had a very thick sauce)  Then added some salsa to add a little flavor.  I did the milk flour and butter as the recipe stated, then kinda went on my own.  Thanks for giving me the idea of how to make my own nacho cheese sauce!
