This is definitely our favorite stir-fry recipe. I do modify it a little, though, as follows:
 
1. I use stir-fry beef instead of round steak. It comes out much more tender.
2. I double the marinade, but put half in a separate container. This will be the sauce for the stir-fry veggies. 
3. First, I put on the beef with its marinade, and let it cook until done. Then, I remove the beef, and add stir fry veggies and pineapple with the other batch of marinade sauce. Once those are crisp tender, I add the meat back in to warm it up, as well as the sesame seeds, and serve over rice or noodles. 
It's one of my favorite things to eat!!!

OUTSTANDING!!!  My DH and kids were in utter heaven eating this meal!
I, too, doubled the recipe, & doubled the marinade. Then cooked the meat quickly, removed it to large bowl while I stir fried fresh broccoli, julienned carrots and onion to tender-crisp, then added the beef back to the skillet and simmered it a little longer in the sauce, thickenening it with a small amount of cornstarch.  This was a fantasic one-dish meal!  THANKS!!!

I doubled the marinade, and replaced the vegetable oil with one and a half tablespoons of sesame oil so it's a lot less oily.  Used half the marinade for the meat and marinated over 24 hours.  Then I stir fried the meat for a few minutes, added broccoli and rehydrated dried shitake mushrooms, and the rest of the marinade.  Covered and cooked til the broccoli was the way we like it, then added some cornstarch to thicken.  My husband said, "You weren't expecting leftovers, were you?"  (There are only two of us)  Next time I would omit the sesame seeds, as the oil gave it plenty of sesame flavor and the actual seeds got lost in everything else I added.  I know some people get upset when you change a recipe and review it the way you made it instead of the recipe, but we like what we like and this was easy and delicious to make the way you like it.  Neither of us found this too sweet, but it if you don't like slightly sweet main dishes, you may want to cut the sugar a little.

Hubs and I really enjoyed this, just as we do most stir fries.  However, the amount of sugar called for is about four times more than you need – so I did reduce it to just a fourth of what was directed, and used brown sugar rather than white.  It was just right.  As for the meat, I wanted something more tender than round steak for this quick cooking method so I used sirloin (No Name Steak, to be exact, that I always keep on hand for this very purpose).  I also included some good-sized shrimp and, to make this a complete meal, I stir fried some vegetables as well - baby bok choy, mushrooms, bean sprouts and onions.  I sprinkled on the toasted sesame seeds and green onion just before serving, in an amount that seemed right to me rather than measuring.  What I loved best about this recipe was its simple, clean flavors, not bogged down by lots of different spices or “heat.”

What a great recipe and not at all labour intensive! However, I would recommend a few changes:

- Instead of using 4 tbsp each of oil, soy sauce, and sugar... use 4 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp oil, and 2 1/2 tbsp sugar. (If you stick to the original, it may be a little too oil and sweet for your liking.)
- Add 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce
- If you want to add veggies (I added asparagus and steamed broccoli), double the sauce.

Absolutely delicious and very simple. Like a few others I sprinkled in a touch of red pepper flake. I also stir fried with very thinly sliced onion and served over steamed rice - might add some carrot next time. Made some snow peas to accompany. Very good, very easy meal.

I marinated the meat for about 4 hours in the fridge and it was tender, but the sauce was disappointing and there wasn't nearly enough of it, despite the fact that I doubled the recipe for it.

Great flavor but a little too sweet.  Will use 1/2 the sugar called for next time I make it.  I also added broccoli which we found a nice addition.

For working moms, this dish is so easy and super fast!  I made this last night and my husband loved it.  I didn't have any green onions, but it was still tasty.  Also, before cooking the beef, I sauted some asparagus spears cut into 2 inch pieces in canola oil and soy sauce with some sesame seeds.  Once that was done (about 5 minutes), I removed the asparagus from the pan and cooked the meat.  When it came time to add the sesame seeds to the meat, I threw the aspargus in, too.  Delicious!!!  I served with store-bought egg rolls to round out the meal. We will definately make this again!

I just wanted to make a quick, flavorful dish that didn't require me buying more than 2 items from the grocery store.  Mission accomplished!  I ONLY had to buy the green onions and the beef.  Everything else I had in my cupboards. The result...I now have a recipe for an "oh-so-tasty" dish that I can make in a short period of time.  

ONLY CHANGES - I remembered reading what one reviewer said about decreasing the sugar so I cut that in half, down to 2 tablespoons and I added 3 green onion stalks instead of two and also added an extra gralic clove. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED *****

This was very good. The sauce is similar to a marinade I use for shish kabob's. It was a winner with my family!

This was really good.  Next time I would add some onions and maybe pea pods and a little chili paste for some spice.  The flavor was wonderful and so easy!

I've made this recipe many times--it is my "go to" summer vacation recipe when I have to cook for 20+ family members!  I recommend marinating overnight if possible, and buying thin sliced top round steak.  Freeze it a little (not all the way through) and then cut really thin slices with a good pair of kitchen shears.  I can't imagine using a knife to cut all the beef--use a good pair of kitchen scissors!  It is really fast and easy once you get the method down.  You can also add almost any fresh vegetable but beware of frozen vegetables--they can add water/sogginess.

Made it at the fire station. I was worried that the round steak might be too tuff so instead of just marinating it, I put the meat and marinade in the crock pot on low for 4 hours. Then I stir fried the meat with pea pods, broccoli, mushrooms and carrots. I recommend using low sodium soy sauce.

This was very good. My husband loved it. After the meat had thoroughly cooked, I added some green pepper and cooked it until the green peppers got a little soft.  In a seperate bowl, I combined a little soy sauce, white sugar, garlic, water, cornstarch and added it to the meat until it thickened up and put everything over rice.

Fantastic and easy!  I used stirfry beef and only marinated for about 15 minutes.  I omitted the green onions since I didn't have any.  Stirfried the beed in the marinade, removed from the pan and then cooked frozen stirfry veggies and crushed pineapple in another batch of the marinade.  Added cornstarch and sesame seeds and put the beef and marinade back in until the liquid thickened.  Hubby and I agreed that this is the best stirfry recipe I've tried, and I've tried quite a few.

This recipe made a very good dish. I must admit I was a little bit disappointed, but only because I had very high expectations, I guess. I love this kind of dish at Chinese restaurants, and had never made anything quite like this. I made the recipe pretty much as written, using sunflower oil instead of generic "vegetable oil", and marinating the steak for about 24 hours. For the steak, I used a little over a pound of bottom round. This also marked the first time I'd ever cooked with sesame seeds. Marinating time aside, this gets points for being a very quick and easy recipe. I had half of this on a bed of boiled white rice, to soak up the sauce. For the other half the next night, I just spooned up the extra sauce, which was very tasty by itself. I do recommend this recipe; I just wonder what it would take to transform it from "very good" to "fantastic!"

For a science class project, we had to find a recipe and make it. Something about comparing and Photosynthesis... ugh. 
But I found this, thought it looked heavenly, and decided to try it. 
Was the best thing I've ever tasted. 
My taste buds thank you very much, and so does my report card.

I changed this recipe a bit, but I might try to do it more like the recipe next time!  I really liked the flavor, but I cooked onions, zucchini and green pepper right in with the meat, and it caused the meat to over cook (while I was waiting for the veggies to soften).  Next time I will pre cook the veggies and add them in at the end.  I also added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce, because with the extra liquid from the veggies, it was a bit too watery.  Otherwise, it was a great recipe and super easy!

I made this with chicken instead of beef and took the other reviewers' suggestion about changing over to brown sugar instead of white. I also halved the sugar and it was plenty sweet. I would actually consider dredging it in flour before cooking to get a better texture, but the taste was good. I think some veggies wouldn't hurt either. Maybe some brocolli?

I have had something similar at PF Changs...  I too doubled the marinade.  To get a thicker sauce with more intense flavor laddle most of the marinade into the pan and reduce prior to cooking the beef.  Place the reduced marinade (syrup like but not too thick) in the serving dish and then cook the meat.  Add it to the reduced marinade and mix to distribute.  WOW!

I substituted 2 T fish sauce + 2 T water for the soy sauce. Then before I cooked the meat, I strained the liquid off it, added a couble tablespoons of cornstarch, and then cooked in a pan with hot oil. This helped the meat get a little crispy on the edges instead of steaming. Then the reserved liquid I cooked with extra veggies, and I mixed it all together and sered it over rice.

This was an absolute delight to prepare as well as eat.  My husband and I could not stop picking at the leftovers.  This was a really inexpensive meal to make for those of us who need to watch the budget a little more closely.  And not being able to use the stove in the middle of this heat wave just made this a recipe I will cherish for years to come! Thank you Lynn!!!

Awesome.  I doubled the marinade and omitted the green onions (4 yr old refuses to eat them).  I also used flat iron steak since I had it on hand.  I have made this several times, and it always turns out great.  I usually steam some broccoli and stir it in towards the end.  Serve over white rice.  Great as leftovers too.

Four and a half stars. Easy and delicious with a few changes. For the marinade I mixed one tablespoon sugar, two tbsp minced garlic, six tbsp each soy sauce and toasted sesame seed oil. I added 3/4 tbsp chili garlic paste. Added one pound thinly sliced beef until well-coated and let marinate in the fridge for about 2 hours. I cooked the beef first, about 5 minutes; I then added in a bag of frozen California vegetables (a mixture of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and let cook for an add'l 2-3 minutes before adding in julienned red and yellow bell pepper, sliced green onions and a pinch of sesame seeds. At this point I added in another tbsp of soy sauce and about 3/4 cup chicken stock; brought to a boil and then added 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken. This tasted delicious on jasmine rice. Thanks for the recipe.

We really love this recipe at our house!  Its the closest to restaraunt style chinese I have made.  I only give it 4 stars though because as is its too oily and there is not enough sauce.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce but I also replaced most of the oil with chicken broth.  I actually only use about 1 tbsp of sesame oil and then about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I also add a bag of cooked,  asian style veggies (which I buy frozen - it has water chestnuts, carrots, peppers and brocolli) into the finished mixture.  If I have fresh veggies on hand I'll add them in too (like red peppers or asparagus).

This dish goes well with most veggies so just add in whatever you got!

This was pretty good.  I used top sirloin instead of round.  Next time I will separate the meat from the marinade before I cook it so that the meat sautees instead of boils in the liquid.  I will also use some brown sugar in addition to the white sugar.  I did add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken a bit. I think this would be very good with broccoli and red bell pepper added to it.

Very good. My kids request this at least once a month. I like to add extra broccoli and I double the marinade.  Also, add a chunk of mashed kiwi to the marinade. Its a trick I learned from my Korean neighbor, it makes the beef extremely tender.

This is my first review.  I have tried many recipes from this site but this one really was very simply delicious.  I read the reviews first and cut the sugar to my taste (a little less than half) used olive oil in the marinade, added orange bell pepper, zucchini and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS! Doubled the marinade as per previous reviews.  Hubby devoured.  This is now a staple.

Wife gave it 5, me 4.  It was sweet (using 3 TBS) but that made it different.  It could use veggies.  Very easy to make, if you can remember to start it the day before.

These are good, quick and easy. Sometimes I would use this sauce for stir frying vegetables without meat/poultry. Yes, double the sauce. Half for marinating the meat and the other half when your ready to stir in the vegetables.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes: only had time to marinate for 1/2 hr (still took on flavour) cooked the beef without the marinade, then added cornstarch with the sauce after.  Reduced sugar by half and used half white and half brown sugar.  Also added carrots and broccoli to the stir fry and served it all on egg noodles.  YUM!!!

This recipe was great with my following changes: reduce sugar to 1 1/2 tbsp, substitute 1/2 tbsp of vegetable oil with sesame oil, add 2 tsp freshly crushed peppercorns, and reduced soy sauce to 3 tbsp. (used Kikkoman brand soysauce, saltiness of soysauce definitely varies from brand to brand). Was only able to marinate the meat for 45 mintues but t was fantastic!  As an appetizer, try wrapping strips around asparagus stalks and bake at 350 degrees celcius for 20-25 minutes, broiling the last 5 minutes.  The sauce becomes a little glazed on the meat! yum!

This was very good.  I gave it four stars rather than five as it was a little on the bland side.  I did add some sesame oil to the marinade but I only added 1/4 tsp.  I couldn't taste the sesame at all.  Next time I will add more.  After stir frying the meat I transferred it to a covered bowl to keep warm.  I then stir fried a mixture of broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, yellow and orange peppers, beans and mushrooms (what I happened to have at the time) in a litte oil.  I added about 1 tbsp of water to the wok, covered and let the vegetables steam for a few minutes.  I then added the meat back and added a sauce made from 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of beef broth, 1 tsp. white sugar, 2 tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce and 2 tbsp of cornstarch.  I then stirred to thicken.  I served this over a bed of chow mein noodles.

This recipe was excellent! I first cooked a package of frozen stir-fry vegetable mix and removed it the skillet. I then cooked the marinated beef in the same skillet and when close to done, I added the vegetables back in to reheat. It was so much better than take-out. Will definitely make again!

I used this marinade on chicken rather than beef.  I didn't have scallions or garlic so I replaced these ingredients with 1 tsp. of both garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes because I couldn't help myself. (love the zing it addded) It now looks like I have a new sesame chicken recipe as it received all thumbs up from my family of 9.  Thank you, I will fix this recipe again and again, and again.

I subbed brown sugar and doubled everything else but the sugar. We have lots of beef in the freezer (just got a cow)so I use round, sirloin, even chuck steak. Marinate over night. Serve over rice. I also stir fry any combo of veggies I have, onions (or green onions), carrots, snow peas, broccoli, cauliflower, green peas, green beans, bok choy etc. (whatever I have on hand!)and add to the dish. My kids LOVE it!!!

I have been looking for a good stir fry recipe that did not involve teryaki (not a fan of it) and this was just what I wanted!  I doubled the marinade like many suggested and made it with zucchini and mushrooms on top of white rice.  I didn't have green onions and I forgot to use the sesame seeds, but it was still delicious!

I'm amazed by how easy and delicious this was.  This is probably the quickest meal I've ever made.  I cut up the meat and threw it together with the marinade before I went to work.  When I came home, I stuck some rice in the rice cooker and fried up the meat for like 5 minutes and done!  I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch stirred up with some cold water to the meat and marinade sauce to thicken it up and it was perfect.

This is excellent.  After reading all the reviews I doubled the marinade, did not use onions as my daughter and boyfriend won't eat them, and STILL it was delicious.  Be sure to stir the marinade WELL so all the dry ingredients dissolve properly.  This one is a keeper!

Hubby and I both loved this.  I added some asparagus for hubby (I don't like the stuff) and served it with a side of sesame rice and crab rangoon.  Delicious.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks for the post.

Truly wonderful & easy!  I used 1 tsp sesame oil w/olive oil, all brown sugar & tamari sauce instead of soy sauce.  Added fresh asparagus...yum! Made a small beef broth slurry w/cornstarch to add at the end.  I served over jasmine rice and sprinkled w/sesame seeds.  Very elegant looking & delicious.  Thanks for the post.

Very good and very easy recipe.  I made this recipe for a weeknight meal and it was delicious. I marinated the steak for an hour and a half and it was very flavorful. I did as other reviewers suggested, however, and doubled the recipe for the sauce (it was nice to have extra to drizzle over the meat when I was serving). In addition, I only added two tablespoons of oil instead of four (and I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil for extra flavor). After marinating, I drained the sauce through a sieve and put it into a saucepan to warm, and stirred in 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken it. I served the steak with jasmine rice and sauteed red peppers and onions. Yumm!  I will be putting this recipe into weekly rotation.  Next time I make it the only change I will add is to put only half the sugar called for in the recipe, as it was a tiny bit too sweet for my taste.

Very good.  I doubled the sauce but added red pepper flakes and 1-1/2 to 2 Tbs of fresh, minced ginger and corn starch to thicken.  Added asparagus, red bell pepper, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.  Turned out very good.

Oh my gosh - this is TOO tasty! The liquid marinates very well into the meat... just be sure not to over-cook, as the meat will dry out. I chopped a green bell pepper and added it to the skillet, which was a great compliment to the sweet flavor. When meat is done, I removed it from the liquid and added a small amount of cornstarch to thicken (be sure to mix the cornstarch with luke-warm water first, in order to avoid lumps). Cook this on high and stir until liquid thickens a bit. Pour over meat and store. This dish is great when served with fluffy white rice. Thanks for this "restaurant quality" dish!!

Very flavorful and easy to make.  I've made it twice, once only marinating 30 minutes and once doing it 20 hours (overnight).  Definitely marinate overnight.  The meat is much more tender and holds more flavor.  I added some sesame oil and a pinch of red pepper flakes for additional flavor.  I served this over Black Japonica (black and mahogany) rice which was the perfect accompaniment.

I thought this was just too plain tasting. It needed some more spice...well it at least needed something else. Sorry to say I won't be making this again.

This dish was excellent! I added some broccoli and used brown sugar instead of white. The sesame oil really adds to the flavor! I added it to the marinade and drizzled a little over the dish when it was done cooking. I only marinated 30 min and this was plenty. I will make this again!

My son asks for this every week and he is a picky eater. The only tweaking I do is add a touch of red pepper flakes for a little spicy kick and occasionally, I wil throw in some fresh broccoli.

This is a variation of one of popular Korean dish.  I added a bit of black pepper, used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, decreased amount of sesame seed in half, and marinated over night.  I also grilled with sliced onions in a cast iron pan.

-this recipe was pretty good, however, 4 tbsp of oil was too much- it tasted very oily and greasy- i think 3 tbsp would be perfect-
-i followed a suggestion by others to use sesame oil- the strong taste of sesame wasn't our cup of tea- perhaps regular vegetable oil would be better after all like is recommended in the original recipe- i am going to give this recipe another try with the ammendments i mentioned and i think it will be a hit!

Like this recipe. It is simple and flavourful. Like the other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp and the vegetable oil to 1 tbsp, and used stir-fry beef strips instead of round steak, which is more expensive. I stir-fried the beef strips in 1 tbsp of sesame oil together with julienned ginger because I love ginger in everything. Definitely will be making again.

delicious! Last minute decision to make it, so I only had 30 minutes to marinade it. Still delicious! I cut the sugar to 3 Tablespoon, will probably only use 2 next time. I wilted some spinach in it, just because I had it.  SUPER GOOD!  I also added some hoison sauce, also good.

This was a great recipe and easy to make for my family after a full day at work. Definitely marinade the meat overnight. The only thing I would change is cut down the amount of oil for the marinade and increase the soy sauce. It was a hit with everyone!

The flavor of this was excellent, my kids loved it.  The only change I made was to use sesame oil, since I had it and it seemed to make sense to use it in a sesame dish.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written (but did mix in cooked asparagus before serving).  Marinated for about 20 hours and the meat was still tough.  Also found it to be a bit too sweet.  The overall flavor was very good though, and I will definitely be making again.  Next time will either tenderize the meat first or try a more tender cut of beef (may also try with chicken at some point).  Will also see how it turns out with a bit less sugar to see if we cant keep the great flavor and the sweet notes without quite so much.  Overall, though, this is the absolute best "Asian" meal I've ever made at home. P.S. This fed three of us, because the kids wanted seconds, so make a double batch!

Great core recipe!
I adjusted the sauce a bit (ratios, this is doubled): 8 tbsp soy sauce, 6 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 3 tbsp brown sugar (add or subtract for desired sweetness) - and mixed it in small blender.  this made about 8 oz (4-5 of which i put on the beef to marinade with a small amount of baking soda and about 1/2 tbsp chopped garlic)
added carrots, celery, pea pods, mushrooms, and onions with rice or stir-fry noodles

So, yummy even with the modifications.  I used low sodium soy sauce. 2 TBS white sugar and 1 TBS Splenda. (I think I will go one TBS each just to make it less sweet).  Used my Foodsaver marinate container and it was ready to cook in 30 minutes.  With the extra sauce I stir fried cabbage, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms, cauliflower and noodles.  There was not a teaspoon left.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this for my family and we all loved it. I did exchange the onion for some fresh green beans (lots!) and served it over white rice. Doubling the sauce makes enough to spoon over rice. I didn't have time to marinade at all, just cooking the beef, (using only enough oil to brown & stir fry, not what the recipe called for) adding the green beans, and sesame seeds & then adding the sauce mixture at the end. Super quick, & delicious. Will make this again.

Cooked this today using beef flank but I reduced the marinate slightly after reading that sugar might be too much.  Used only 3T soy sauce, 3T sugar, 2T olive oil, garlic powder with no green onions and omitted sesame seeds,  Taste is good but still too sweet to my liking.  However, I like how easy it is to prepare this dish, so I'll reduce sugar to 2T next time.

I cooked this with onions and French beans, my daughter loves it and asked me to cook for her lunch again tomorrow.

Made this as is except left out sesame seeds (not fond of them) and added sesame oil instead. My picky son ate 3 helpings, so I know it was good.

Awesome recipe, I made two changes I added water chestnuts (1 can) sliced thinly. I like the crunchiness of the chestnuts and that's the main reason I threw them in. I cut the sugar down to one tablespoon, I am not a big friend of anything sweet. Thanks for sharing.

This was a huge hit with everyone!  I modified it to use what we had on hand.  I doubled the marinade and only used 1/2 of the sugar and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. I didn't have enough soy sauce so I added teriyaki to make up the difference. The kids don't like green onions so I minced part of an onion instead and added it to the sauce before marinating. When the meat was almost done, I added red, green, and orange peppers.  Made some brown rice-Awesome meal!

Made this today but didn't have soy sauce, so I used teriyaki sauce.  Subbed green onions with red onion, and didn't have sesame seeds.  Ate it with brown rice and it was delicious!  Will definitely make again, and will try it the way it's supposed to be made.  :)

I did not read all the reviews before I put my beef into the marinade.  It is REALLY sweet.  I didn't even use regular sugar.  The splenda was probably a little better than if I actually used sugar, so I can't imagine how white sugar would taste.  So next time I will lessen the amount of sugar in half and use a different cut of beef or tenderize it.  The round steak was a little too chewy for me.

This has become a staple recipe in my home. My boyfriend and I make this recipe exactly, and it makes enough for dinner for 2, plus 2 lunches for the next day. We make stir fried rice to go with it. Delicious! It is also a dish we have made for friends, and it is always well recieved.

This was really good, but I modified it some. I used stir fry beef and I only used three teaspoons of sugar. It was a nice salty and sweet flavor. I also served it over egg white noodles. Perfect combo.

I am not a fan of reviewing an altered recipe. That being said...the ONLY alteration I made to this was using some sesame oil because we love sesame flavor in our house. This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I get requests for this from my very picky husband all the time now. Definitely a keeper!

I used 2 TB olve oil in place of the veg oil to keep this on the healthy side.  I marinaded for about 4 hours and then grilled the steaks.  Hubs forgot to put the sesame seeds on and we really didn't miss them but next time I will def add them.  Great flavor for all the venison round steak we still have in the freezer

I love using this recipe but of course I do it to my family's liking.  First I use a bottom round roast but I have the meat guys slice is jerky thin.  I also don't use green onions since I don't have them most of the time.  Yesterday I made this for some guests so I made 8lbs of this and used 1 cup of onion powder and it still turned out great. I also used reduced sodium soy sauce and it still turns out fine.  But the biggest difference I do is that I actually put it out on the grill. It turns out so much better in my opinion.  We usually do the meat, jasmine rice, and then I make up veggie skewers of mushrooms, zuchini, and red pearl onions  marinated in panzo sauce.  It's always a hit even with my 6yr old. It was a hit yesterday

This was good but I agree with others a little too sweet.  I will make again but I will use less sugar and a little red pepper flakes to diffuse it a bit.  Other than that it was a good recipe and I will make it again.  I added asparagus at the end.  Thanks!

I have to go along with many of the previous reviews....this dish was excellent, yet a bit too salty.  I'm also not sure why the meat came out tough?  Maybe someone has some helpful tips.  The flavors for this dish are great though...and I  bought real rice wine (saki)...maybe that's why it was a bit salty.

Excellent.  I used 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup sugar, vegetable oil plus a couple os splashes of sesame oil to fill 1/3 cup, 3 cloves of garlic and 3 green onions.  I had "beef round sliced thin for milanese", which is what it said on the package, and it worked GREAT.  I marinated the meat for about 4 hours.  After I cooked the meat in the pan, I removed it, then stir fried some broccoli, carrots and mushrooms in the sauce that was left in the pan, then added the beef back to the pan.  Served over white rice, and it was wonderful.  My family loved this - no left overs!  Yeah!

I've made this recipe many times at our house.  I find that you really have to use a good cut of meat for it to be tender enough, so I use boneless sirloin.  The round steak is just to tough. I also add red pepper flakes, broccoli and mushrooms and serve it over plain ramen noodles.  It is delicious.

this is my "go to" recipe - great for company as well as for last minute meals (since I freeze this.)
although i never make it the same way twice - here are several modiications.
Triple the soy sauce 2/3 cup(LOW sodium), double the oil (half sesame 1/4c and half veg. oil 1/4 c), 1/4 c of sugar and couple tsp of honey.  Add sliced onions and ginger.  Add any type of veggies I have available and marinate / freeze.

This recipe is one of the best stir-fry's I've ever had.  When you make it, make sure that you make double, because you will end up eating it all [the recipe calls for 4, but my boyfriend and I finished it all last night between the two of us].
I did modify it.  I don't like things too sweet, so I used 2.5 tbsp. of sugar.  I also used a good, low-sodium soy sauce [Kinkkoman's].  I didn't have green onions, so I finely diced about a half of a regular onion and added it.  I also added a pinch of onion powder and a few red pepper flakes.  As for the sauce, I noticed that there wasn't a lot, so I increased the amount of soya sauce and oil [NOT SUGAR] to 7 tbsp each [or 1/4 cup and 3 tbsp].
Outstanding and thanks for the recipe!!!

Very good.  I put a bit of chili paste in it and that made it taste great.  Also used corn starch like another review said and that made the sauce really stick to the beef.

This recipe was wonderful.  We will be making it again and again.  I may cut down the sugar some though because I found it a touch on the sweet side.  My husband loved it that way and thought it was perfect.

This was such a good recipe! I turned it into a good stir-fry by adding one tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in a little bit of cold water after cooking the beef and removing it from the wok. I then added vegetables. DELICIOUS!

Excellent!  I added mushrooms, broccoli, red & orange pepper and water chestnuts.  Also, I doubled the sauce since I added so much extra things.

We really liked this dish!  Per previous reviews, I changed the sugar to brown sugar & I dredged the beef in flour.  I'm not sure if the flour dredging made a difference or not for us.  I also added extra garlic and, to cut the sweetness a bit, added some hot pepper paste.

My boyfriend loved this, but I only had 3 or 4 bites and that was enough.  It was so salty and had way too strong of a soy sauce flavor for me.  And I like soy sauce; I usually drown sushi in it, but this was too much in my opinion.  I added fresh broccoli about 5 minutes before the meat was fully cooked and the broccoli tasted wonderful; perhaps because it hadn't marinated overnight.  Maybe brown sugar would add more depth and counteract the saltiness.  I'll try this again, but with some changes.  My awfully disobedient dog got to my plate when I stepped away for a second and she seemed to really enjoy it. :)

Tasted good, but not any better than a store bought marinade.  The cooking time for the meat should only be around 4 minutes, not 7 as the recipe states.  Because the beef was in strips in got too tough when cooked for 7 minutes.

This was awesome. I used already cut up meat from the supermarket, for ease. I also used shallot in place of the green onion because I didn't have any. Excellent, can't wait to make again!

I have made this twice with great results.  The first time I followed the instructions exactly.  It was very good but I thought it needed some veggies.  The second time I used chicken (because I had it on hand) and added broccoli.  It was even better!  I will continue to make the sauce in this recipe and try different meat and veggie combos.  Easy recipe to adjust to personal taste.

Excellent and easy! I confess that I did add, in addition to the green onions, quartered yellow sweet onions, yum! I only marinated this for one hour and look forward to an overnight marinade next time; even with the short marinade time it was outstanding. Also next time hubby wants me to also add green peppers. I doubled this and used stew meat (all that I had and the wind was raging outside at 20mph) and this turned out wonderfully. Next time I will make with the thin strips of beef as the recipe calls for. My 15 year old went for seconds and tried to eat his brothers portion also! Made this with House Fried Rice sans meat from this site. What a fun Chinese meal at home. Thanks for sharing!

I made only the sauce and used it to stir fry prawns and vegetables.  I left out the sesame seeds, used only 3 tbs of vegetable oil and added 1.5 tbs of sesame oil.  It was really good on top of jasmine rice.  Note: This will only taste good to those who like their stir fries sweet.

Loved this recipe! I used 2 lbs tenderized beef and therefore, I used 3 TBLS sesame oil, 1 TBLS veg oil, 5 TBLS sugar, 5 TBLS soy sauce and added garlic/green onions until I felt they looked right. I think what made this recipe better was a mistake I made: I misread the recipe and used brown sugar instead of white! But this was a good opps!! About 3 minutes before the meat was done, I added a thawed pkg of broccoli stir-fry veggies. Served all over white rice. This was great! There wasn't alot of "sauce" but it was still delicious! I will make it this way again! Meat was both tender and flavorful! Thanks Lynn!

Very easy and very good!  Used about 1/4 of a medium regular onion instead of green onion.  I just chopped it up really small.  Only marinaded for about 45 minutes and the flavor was still great. Served it over rice - YUM!  This is going to become an old standby.

Added crushed red pepper and used sesame sauce instead of cooking oil.   Per other review, I bought the thin cut casserole beef and cut sugar by 1/2.   Served with stir fried rice, 1 cup snow peas, 1 cup broccoli slaw and 2 asparagus.   Great meal!   

- Next time, marinate the meat the day before.
- Double the sauce to account for the veggies.

Outstanding recipe!  My granddaughter licked the bowl clean after I made the sauce for the meat.  I put the meat in a large zip-lock bag and poured the sauce over it.   The next time I make it I will make TWO of the marinades (one for the meat and one for the stir-fry veggies).  I put it over rice which soaked up quite a bit of the sauce.  While we loved the meal, we decided it needed more sauce.   I used 2 pkgs of frozen 'steam in bag' stir-fry veggies and pre-cooked in the microwave for 4 mins. before adding to the stir-fry.  It's a keeper of a recipe.

I made this last night and used sirloin and chicken breast.  It was FABULOUS!  This is the best Teriyaki recipe that I've ever tried.  I cooked these over charcoal for that authentic Japanese flavor and they were just wonderful.  This is now one of our favorites.

Made some changes based on other reviews - I used 2T sugar, 2T olive oil (didn't have any EVOO in stock), about 2T garlic, used lite kikkoman soy sauce & half a cup of green onions. I accidentally added the sesame seeds w/ the marination which I think didn't disrupt the flavor & marinated the meat for 15-20 mins which still had tons of flavor. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I will definitely try the original submission the next time I prepare this!

This was great! I added a little cornstarch (with water) to make more of a sauce that I could add over the rice and it was delish! Thanks!

This is THE BEST stir fry I've ever eaten! I used stir fry beef in place of the round steak. Also, I doubled the marinade, using 1 and one half tablespoons of sesame seed oil. I also used half of the sugar. I steamed some fresh broccoli and added it in. Served with white rice and vegetable egg rolls, it was simply amazing!!!

This was a good recipe for beef. I added stir fry veggies and fried egg noodles to complete the meal. I had run out of soy sauce so I added two tablespoon of teriyaki store bought sauce for stir fry. flavours were good and everyone enjoyed at home including my picky eater 7 year old.

I made this tonight and my husband loved it! I marinated the meat strips for about six hours, adding ginger because we like it but half the sugar. I also had a bag of frozen stir fry vegs/noodles and it was super. Thanks for providing a solid recipe we can use for a springboard.

We loved this recipe! It was a bit sweet but we'll most definitely do it again with less sugar, using brown sugar as others suggested and adding some green peppers and onions to make it go further. We left it marinating for 24 hours and it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe :)

To die for! Used double soy sauce and half sugar, but otherwise kept things the same. Not a scrap was left over, and my husband praised me all night! Will definitely repeat.

Such a simple recipe, but SO good! I made the recipe as written except I substituted sirloin for the round steak because I had some in the freezer. I forgot the sesame seeds, but I think they would have added some nice texture to the dish. We combined it with steamed asparagus and Chinese noodles (ramen noodles would probably be good, too) and it made a quick, delicious dinner.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and my Husband declared it an absolute 5-star recipe! To make this a bit healthier of a dish, serve with a side of steamed broccoli or other vegetables. I marinated my meat for 24 hours and garnished with additional green onions! Delish and a real weeknight hero!

Tasty goodness.  After reading some of the other reviews, I also doubled the marinade, with a slightly different ratio:  1/2 cup soy sauce : 3 Tbs brown sugar : 3 Tbs vegetable oil : 4 cloves garlic : 2 bias-sliced green onions.  After marinating the steak for several hours, I drained and reserved the marinade to add and cook later as a sauce.

I also added some mushrooms and onions.

I loved this recipe. I used stir fry beef, as per other reviewers, it came out so tender. I did double the sauce and added more vegetables (broccoli, mushrooms, and red peppers), fantastic. The whole family loved it.

Loved this! I sliced the beef to make skewers, marinated for an hour and grilled 5 mins on each side over medium direct heat.  Doubled the marinade to use as a sauce afterwards, and used sesame oil instead of veg oil.  Will make this again and already shared the recipe with family.

This is an easy dish to make, but it needed a few changes for me. I followed the recipe the first time I made this - I would probably give it 3 stars - way too sweet as other readers mentioned. The second time I made this, I doubled the sauce ingredients except the sugar - used brown instead of white, and 3 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil instead of the vegetable. Half of this was used for marinade, the other half reserved for later. Added 2 tablespoons cornstarch to the reserved sauce. Stir-fried the meat, removed it from the pan, then stir-fried sliced mushrooms, chopped red pepper, and sliced carrots. Put the meat back in the pan to heat it back up. Then added the sauce and let it thicken up some. Served this over steamed rice with steamed pea pods and asparagus on the side. Awesome! My husband said it tasted like he was at the local Chinese restaurant - but without all the MSG! This will probably be served at my house at least every other week - I love it! Next time, I may make it with a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies.

I made this tonight and it's so good.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of skirt steak and doubled the sauce.  The steak marinated for about 2 hours.

I cooked the steak to a medium rare with the marinade and removed it.  I added the second batch (to that I added ginger and sriracha) and cooked asparagus, red bell pepper, snow peas, mushrooms and water chestnuts.  I added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce (1/2 cup warm water/1 1/2 tbs cornstarch), put the beef back in and let it warm through.  Just a wonderful dish.

I served it with peanut noodles (this site) but rice would be great as well.  Plenty of sauce to spoon over.  

This one's a keeper.  Loved it.

Had no green onion so I added some onion powder instead. I also used broccoli as the veg and a strip steak for the meat so that I wouldn't have to venture to the store. I thought it was a bit oily and would double the sauce next time so there is some to use on the rice.

This is one of those recipes that you read all the reviews and run out and get all the ingredients!!  It didn't disappoint.  I didn't change the recipe, I just added more vegetables.  I also did as many others suggested and doubled everything and used 1/2 the sauce to saute the veg in.  You can add whatever you like, but I added mushrooms, pea pods, broccoli, onion, and water chestnuts.  It was fantastic!!  You can have it over chow mein noodles,  rice, or nothing if you prefer. Oh, I also used beef shoulder tenders from Fareway.  It's the best for stir fry, stew, etc. I did marinate it overnight as well.  It was great heated up the next day too.  AWESOME STIR-FRY!!  YOU MUST TRY!!

The marinade was wonderful but the steak was so tough we couldn't chew it.  I will definitely make again but I would use sirloin instead of round.

Five stars for a great basic recipe. I just love this but I always use some cooking sherry and freshly grated ginger in my marinade which gives it a very good flavor. I also leave out the sugar. You can use just about any fresh vegetable you have around to mix in with the meat. Serve over jasmine rice and make some hot green tea...and you'll think you're at your favorite Asian restaurant. ;)

4 Tablespoons of sugar for 1 lb of round steak- really?   A teaspoon, if any, to smooth out the pungent flavors - who needs the calories?  This is a very basic recipe - there are more detailed ones online.

I used two Tbsp sesame oil + 2 Tbsp veg oil per suggestions of others. It was delicious and tender, after marinating for only 45 minutes and cooking with all the liquid in until the end. Then I poured the excess off and finished cooking.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I had 1/2 lb pre-cut beef for stir fry I had bought, so I just cut the recipe in half. It was as good as any sesame beef that might come from a restaurant. I did add a spoon of vegetable oil to the pan and heated it before adding the marinated beef. I was worried about the liquid amount, but after the sesame seeds were added it thickend it up. Don't leave them out. For a more a filling meal I would definitely serve with rice and some vegetables. TY

Fabulous flavor!  Per another review, I used 1.5 Tbsp. of sesame oil & omitted the sesame seeds.  Quick & delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Easiest, best tasting beef stir-fry I've made.  I cut the sugar in half like a lot of others.  I added bok choy at the end, because it cooks quickly like spinach, so its a super easy vegetable to add.  I will be making this often.

Really good!! Husband and my sister who was here for dinner loved it. Very tasty it was all gone no leftovers! I did change the recipe a bit taking the advice from someone else's comment. I doubled the soy sauce, vegetable oil, and the garlic. The sugar in the marinade though I only put in 6 tablespoons instead of 8 tablespoons. I also did what another person had mentioned and cut the marinade in half and put each of it aside then cooked the beef separate from the vegetables, then together towards the end with the sesame seeds.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I did differently was I doubled the marinade, added some green & red peppers to it. I also added alittle cornstarch to make the juices more of a gravy & served it over a bed of rice. Absolutley Delicious!!! Next time I will cut the sugar in 1/2 and add some water chestnuts.

Wow, this was to die for!!  I used boneless sirloin because I know round steak can be tough.  I marinated it for about 2 hours (luckily my husband had to work later!)  I used Kikkoman low sodium soy sauce, and kept adding a little sugar at a time until it was sweet enough - I guess it equaled to a little more than 1/2 the amount called for - I didn't measure :-(   I cut back on the oil - I only used about 1/4 the amount. I doubled the marinade and used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.  Served over white rice.  My husband and I liked this a LOT!!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

This is AMAZING! Tasted even better than most beef entrees at the Chinese buffets! The only thing I did different is used splenda in place of the sugar and as other people mentioned, I doubled the sauce and used one batch of sauce to cook the meat in and one batch for the veggies and then added it all together. YUM!!! I will make this over and over again!

Good, but this did get mixed reviews here... I found the beef overly sweet, but my husband (who usually is more sensitive to sweet food than myself) really liked it. The sauce had a great flavor, but it was like the beef just absorbed too much sugar for my tastes. I added broccoli and water chestnuts. Might try again with less sugar and less marinating time. Thanks :)

This recipe is actually similar to something I made up at home. Instead of making the sauce, I found a product called "Iron Chef Garlic Sesame Sauce" at Wegmans (a store you probably only know if you live in NY or PA) but I'm sure they sell it other places, in the asian food section. I just stir fry the cut up steak with that sauce and a couple dashes of teryaki sauce if I feel like it, add whatever vegetables I want, and serve it over noodles mixed with the leftover sauce from the meat. Basically the same thing, but less steps.

Good recipe, but made a few changes. I used gluten free soy sauce, about 1 tbsp of honey instead of sugar, added 1 tbsp of tahini to the marinade and used a small onion instead of the green onions.  I let the meat marinate in the sauce for about an hour.  I cooked it in a wok, sprinkling about 1/2 tbsp of ground ginger on it and then set it aside. I made another batch of the sauce to cook the vegetables in. I started with broccoli, carrots and celery.  Then when they were starting to get tender I added zucchini, red pepper and mushrooms. I sprinkled some more ground ginger on it and then about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I added the meat back, added the sesame seeds, cooked a bit longer and then served over brown rice.  Will make again.

This was awesome.. my family was begging for more and I even doubled the recipe and served over leftover rice.  Simple and easy!!  One thing I changed was that I used Splenda instead of sugar because it was all I had.  I don't think it made a difference at all.. except in cals/carbs.  Will make this again and again!  Better than take-out!

Scrumptious!  I didn't change much but I added a smidge of chile paste to the marinate because we like our asian food with a bit of heat but it didn't alter the flavor much. I also wanted to make this a stir-fry, so I marinated the meat as directed but before cooking the meat I cooked up some bell peppers, carrot, onion and broccoli to tender-crisp, then I removed that from the skillet.  I then cooked the meat, as that cooked I added about 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch to about 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth I had in the fridge. Once the meat was cooked, I added the entire marinade (which I tripled by the way) let it simmer for 2 minutes then added the cornstarch mixture.  Once it thickened I added the veggies and served immediately over jasmine rice.

I prepared this for dinner last night.  It was amazing.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have any beef, so I used chicken strips instead.  I added broccoli, julliene cut carrots and sliced mushrooms for the vegetables.  I think just about any vegetables would be awesome in this sauce.  I could even eat it without any meat at all, just veggies.

We liked this a lot.  I think next time we'll add 32 oz of stir fry veggies (used frozen kind to save time) instead of just 16. I used regular onions instead of green and forgot to put in the sesame seeds. Also used sesame oil.

This was delicious!  I mixed in some frozen broccoli and mushrooms, and doubled the sauce.  my sliced round steak was only marinating for about an hour and it turned out really tender (to my surprise!).  I served it with Brazilian White Rice from this website - next time I think I'll try egg noodles.

This was a true hit with myself and my children!  However I did make some additions. Insead of flank steak I used Beef stew meat.  Instead of green onions I used yellow onions that is all that I had at the time.  I used a bag of frozen "Sugar snap peas stir fry" (which included the following vegetables, broccoli, sugar snap peas, yellow squash, green beans, red peppers, carrots, yellow peppers, water chestnuts, delicious!) from the store in addition, I cut up more carrots and also cut up some green peppers. I did follow the directions by adding the soy sauce, sugar, oil, garlic, and onions, but I added the sesame seeds to the marinade instead of cooking it at the end.  Prior to cooking the beef I seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little minced garlic. Since the garlic was going to be in the marinade, I used very little on the meat itself.  I put the meat in with the marinade for about 45 minutes-1 Hour.   Everyone loved this, the meat was very juicy and there were absolutely NO LEFTOVERS!!!

Delicious! My husband never eats Asian and he actually really enjoyed this dish.  Both times I've made this dish I only had time to marinade the meat for about 45 minutes and it still turned out great.

So easy and so tasty.  I used a better cut of steak and purchased thinly sliced.  It made it so easy to slice.  Marinated it for just over an hour and it was full of flavor. Served it with brown rice and steam broccoli - delicious!  Even my kids ate the whole thing and for the first time...did not pick out the green onions!

Didn't have the full asian flavor I was hoping for.  Only marinated the beef for about 30 mins so that might be the reason.

Very tasty recipe. Just what I was looking for in a sesame stir fry. We substituted chicken instead of the beef and it was very tender. The longer you are able to marinate, the better! We added mushrooms, diced carrots, broccoli florets, adn extra onion. I served it over steamed brown rice...delicious!

Good side dishes with this are quartered boiled potatos (with chopped dill added after boiling) and rice. You can also add some asparagus to the sesame beef

My family enjoyed this recipe. To me, it was a bit too sweet, and I steamed some fresh broccoli and peppers and added it. I can't imagine it without veggies in it, as the juice was qutie runny. Overall a decent beef recipe.

Extremely sweet, I would use less sugar. I doubled the recipe and I also added in some cooked asparagus and carrots at the end and added cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. Overall it was good and everyone liked it, it was just too sweet for my liking... but very easy to make.

I'll admit, I didn't use the meat in this recipe, I just made the marinade/sauce for use with a stir-fry... And it was excellent! I used a tiny slice of yellow onion instead of green (maybe 1 tsp, diced fine), and I sprinkled the sesame seeds over the veggies. It was so good and exactly what the stir fry needed. Thank you for sharing, Lynn!

We LOVE this recipe.  I double the recipe and marinade my veggies too.  I use sesame oil instead of seeds.  I also add water chesnuts and peanuts at the last minute.  I use tenderized stew meat for something different.  Always easy and always delicious.

It smelled great.  I used sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil and doubled it!  However.. the taste was a little bland.. it might taste better with some crushed red pepper and ginger to kick it up a bit.

Excellent! I used pepper steak meat (it came cut up in pieces so that saved me a step) and I added thawed frozen broccoli to the mix. Very easy to make and good. I will for sure make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly except adding 1/4 cup white wine.  I marinated the beef overnight (maybe 12 hr), and it's true that this is too sweet.  I should've probably cut the sugar in half and adding red pepper flakes as others had suggested.  This recipe is missing something because it's not all that flavorful. Chunks of sauteed onions helped some, but it was still lacking in flavor.

I dont know why it tastes good--there's nothing in it! No wine, no ginger... but it was tasty. I skipped the green onions and used yellow onion chunks and added snow peas to the stir fry. Definitely a winner, though I'm still not sure why!

YUMMY!  I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious!  I added 6 T of soy sauce instead of 4.  I added sesame oil too.  I stir-fried it with Asparagus and served it next to pot stickers and sticky white rice!  Next time I will cut back on the vegetable oil and add more sesame oil.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My family loved this dish.  I used a 1 and 3/4 pound sirloin steak.  Substitued onion for dried minced onion.  Marinated all day.  Stir fried for 10 minutes as I like red meat well done,  then added fresh sno peas until tender.  Next time I will try this with sliced pork tenderloin.

Deliciou! Very quick and easy. I used Splenda instead of sugar, used low sodium soy and added a TBSP each of rice vinegar and sesame oil. I also used a regualr onion. Marnaded overnight. Cooked the beef, then added the onions, some broccoli and mushrooms. To thicken the marinade I added a TBSP of cornstarch and then added the leftover marinade to the stir fry. Lots of flavour!

The marinade had a great flavor.  I marinated the beef overnight.  The taste was great but the round steak was very tough.  I will try again with another cut of meat.  I am rating the marinade only.

This recipe is superb. I use the same ingredients except I substitute maple syrup or honey for the sugar. I usually double the marinade and soak my beef for 30 minutes. To thicken it, I use a bit of water and corn starch mixed together and add it right before the vegetables are ready. When done, I top with sesame seeds.

I loved this, even though I didn't have any sesame seeds! I didn't find a need to double the sauce, the recipe was perfect as is.  Since I didn't have sesame seeds, though, I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  It IS a sweet recipe, but that's what Sesame Beef is supposed to be - and it's delicious! Thanks!

Very tasty!  I added lots of fresh veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, peppers, onions) and thickened the sauce using a little cornstarch.  My kids loved this recipe.  Will definitely make this in the future.

This is my wife's favorite recipe.  I add chopped broccolli, green peppers and asparagus.  It's great served over rice.

We thought that this was good but not great. It was too sweet.  I should have decreased the sugar.  I also wish that I would have added a little corn starch to the sauce as some of the other reviews stated.

This was very very good. The flavor was fantastic, and everyone asked for seconds (next time I'll make more!) I doubled the marinade, and seperated it from the beef before stir frying. As suggested by others, I added a bit of cornstarch to the marinade and thickened it up a bit. I also added water chestnuts when I returned the marinade to the wok. Super, super recipe and very easy!

Not flavorful enough for me. I marinated over night. Stir fried without all the liquid (thought it would just boil the meat). Removed meat and put nappa cabbage and the reserved sauce in to quickly cook. I mixed the two together and so I am not sure why the flavor was so weak. Will probably made it again because it was still good just not great.

Loved, Loved, Loved this beef. I also steamed some broccoli and red peppers and served over rice.One suggestion do not cook with extra marinade, instead add some cornstarch to it and simmer for a couple of min. and then drizzle over rice.

Okay, my husband and I almost have a problem with this stuff-we cannot stop eating it.  It is so good and so quick to make and the sauce from the meat is so light that it goes wonderfully over egg noodles.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!

Delicious!! My family ate every last bite.  I used top sirloin.  Next time, I may add some red pepper flakes to give it some spice. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy, and the flavor was good. I doubled the recipe and served it at a dinner a few hours later. I just didn't think the taste was something that I felt 'wow' about. Great for a quick meal, though. Update: I made this a second time (didn't double it this time) and served it immediately (also tossed in fresh broccoli I had cooked for a few minutes before)--much better!

This recipe is AMAZING! I have never had any luck making stir fried beef until I found this simple recipe. I double the recipe but only used half the recommended sugar amount.  I used sesame seed oil (tsp). I also added red pepper flakes. I had a  teriyaki marinade that i added a tablespoon of just for an extra touch. I also added extra garlic.  Anyway, point being that I thorougly enjoyed it and it was a big hit. This will probably be a family recipe forever!

I made this last night for dinner not really knowing what to expect from it.  I was thrilled with the result (as was my husband!) I marinaded the meat for about 6 hours, though next time I'll probably marinade overnight. Just make sure you get good quality meat!  It makes all the difference!

Good tasting sauce and real easy to make.  But don't expect this to taste like what you get in a Chinese restaraunt.  I used round steak as stated and it wasn't very tender.  Next time I'll use something more tender such as sirloin or a flank steak.  The sesame seeds didn't stick to the steak, so next time I'll sprinkle a few on the finished dish.  Can't wait to try it with chicken!

I recently served this recipe at a function for a little over 100 people and it got rave reviews.  I had no less than one dozen people come to me and ask for the recipe.  My daughter informed me tonight that she was coming over for dinner Saturday night and I was gong to make her this Sesame Beef.

I used 1.5 pounds of beef, marinated overnight. I doubled the sauce, except for the oil, which i left at 4 tablespoons, but used sesame oil instead of vegeatble. I didn't have sesame seeds, so left those out. I also added 2 bags of frozen stir-fry veggies and served over rice. The sauce was very good.

Fantastic flavor, just like the carry out down the block!  I did miss the gooey texture so will dredge in flour before stir frying next time.

This was very good and easy to make.  My family liked it very much - I did too but thought it was missing something in flavor.  I used sirloin, and the meat was nice and tender.  As we like a lot of sauce, I also tripled the marinade ingredients except for the sugar and oil. I was afraid it would be too sweet, so I used about half the sugar, and used half white & half brown as other reviewers suggested. Also used only about 2 tbsp veg oil & 1 tbsp sesame oil. I added steamed fresh green beans, broccoli and some fresh snap peas at the end.  All in all very tasty and healthy dinner and I will make again.  Maybe add some chile sauce or paste next time?

This is pretty good! I followed the reviewers' suggestions of doubling the marinade and using brown sugar instead of white, and it worked great! Had enough marinade to make a big vegetable stir fry with as well. A tad sweet, but definitely good!

Good flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes as per a previous reviewer.  I think next time I will add a little bit more for even more heat.  I also increased the garlic (that's what I do...gotta love the garlic).  While cooking I cooked the marinade and meat together, brought to a boil and cooked covered, rather than stirfry.  I then thickened the sauce with cornstarch/water.  The meat turned out very tender.

This was delicious.  I added red and green peppers, as well as snow peas at the very end of the cook time.  It was excellent on brown rice.  I used less sugar, and substituted half sesame oil for the vegetable oil, it added much more flavour.

I thought this recipe was very good, the flavour was wonderful.  I added a couple Tablespoons of hot sauce.  Next time I make it I'm going to add some veggies into the stir fry.  Thanks for the great submission!

Very good.  I added a little it of sesame oil and was glad I didn't do all sesame oil!  I added snow peas and it was great!

This was pretty good, however when I added the sesame seeds, they did not stick to the meat for some reason which was disapointing.

I really enjoyed this recipe and the marinade was marvelous.  I cooked sliced green peppers in the wok for about 3 minutes before I added the beef.  Thanks, Lynn :)

Yum yum!!!! Wow, I was SO surprised by this one. However, I didn't quite get to eat sesame beef, as I didn't have sesame oil or seeds. I doubled the recipebut still used only 4 tbsp sugar and 3 tbsp oil. I simmered about 8 tiny dried red chile pods in water to soften them and added to the marinade. I also julienned 3 carrots and 1 bell pepper, sauted each separately, and added in just before serving over rice. Cornstarch thickened this up nicely. The next day it was even better spiciness-wise!!!!!

i followed the recipe with exception of splitting oil with half sesame and i have to say...just ok.  i even added broccoli for some veggie but it was certainly nothing like anything restaurant style.  def needed more flavor for me.  it was easy, just wish it had more taste.

This would have been amazing except it was TOO sweet.  Definately worth doubling every ingredient in the marinade except the sugar (I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown).  I also added cubed red onion, red and green pepper.

This was very good, but did not compare with other 5 star recipes I have found on this site. I sliced the beef thin but it was too thin the thicker pieces were much juicier. Also, I stir fried half a spanish onion and half a red pepper and add them along with steamed broccoli. Iwill make it again. Husband and I really liked it, my picky teenager thought it was ok.

Wonderful flavor!  Great with rice or reheated the next day on a salad with crispy lo mein noodles.  Tastes like Mongolian Beef at PF Changs.

I definately thought this needed a bit more for a truly robust marinade.  I added about 1/4 cup of beef broth, a touch of sesame oil, and 1/4 cup beer (last).  Also about 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of pepper really helped.  Great base though!

I tbought the recipe was okay. I used round steak as called for, but the meat was a little too tough for my taste.  I thought the marinade had great flavor. I might try this again using top sirlion as oppossed to round steak.

Easy and tasty too! I used thinly sliced sirloin that I marinated for a half hour. Because sirloin is so tender on its own, I only cooked it for about 3 minutes over medium-high heat. The sauce is on the thin side with only three minutes of cooking, but there was plenty of it and my husband loved it. I look forward to trying this with chicken!

This was awesome!  The sauce was the best I've had in a long time and it was SOOOO easy!  I read some other reviews and will try the chicken too, this is definitely a family keeper!  I get so tired of ready these reviews where people get so nasty and whine about "wasting" their time, get over it people, it's a RECIPE!  Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad!

This recipe was good. Also, when I make pizza I also use this recipe for my topping (chicken). I cook the marinated chicken, cool it. Than I spoon it on top of my pizza and throw the cheese on top it. I served it w. salad. Great and healthy.

Very good.  I think the key to keeping the meat tender is slicing it very thin while it is partially frozen.  I used 2 lbs. steak and tripled the sauce.  It was enjoyed by all.

Per others recommendations, I doubled most of the sauce ingredients (but only used 3T of oil and white sugar) and added crushed red pepper flakes.  Marinated for 24 hours.  My husband and I enjoyed this dish so much that we finished it off in one sitting!!  This was so FAST and easy.

If you like the sweet, syrupy fare found at most chinese take-out places, you'll probably like this.  Sweet and flavorful with a nice thick sauce (if it's not thick enough, add a little cornstarch)

Ok this was a hit. I quadrupled the sauce because I added parboiled broccoli and mushrooms.  I also added some crushed ginger.  Very good.

This recipe was delicious! I used a 1.5lb sirloin tip roast and sliced it paper thin while semi-frozen. This always makes the meat very tender and reduces cooking time. I doubled everything except the sugar and the taste was fabulous! My family devoured it! The next time I may add a bit of corn starch to thicken the liquid. I also added frozen broccoli. GREAT recipe!

I give this 5 stars because my husband absolutely loved it.  Although I think the recipe is great, I think it needs some adjustments.  The first time I made it, there wasn't enough sauce.  The second time, I doubled the sauce and used flank steak and my husband was in heaven.  I however think that more fine tuning was needed.  The flavor was a bit too strong when all the ingredients in the sauce were doubled.  Regardless, its a great recipe to work with.

Will definitely be making this one again!  I decreased the oil to 1 Tbsp. and let it marinate from early morning to early evening.  Cooked it a bit longer than necessary, so it wasn't as tender, but that was my fault.  Excellent over rice!

This has a wonderful flavor!  I decreased the oil to 3 T (2T sesame, 1T vegetable) and it was just right for my taste.  I also let the meat marinate for several hours.  I just wish I could make ANY of my stir-fry meats "fork-tender" like they do in the Chinese restaurants.  Even though I try to not overcook, my meat never gets the right texture.  Any hints?  But do try this recipe because it simply tastes great...might even try it with chicken!  Thanks Lynn for sharing!

Delicious! I reduced the sauce so that it glazed the meat before adding the sesame seeds.  Even my kids, who don't often care for Chinese-style foods thought this was yummy.

WOW! My Fiancee LOVED this! THe only thing I did different was use Terriaki sauce instead of soy sauce. I hate to cook and I actually enjoyed making this.

When I first read this recipe, I knew I had to try it!  However, I used venison in place of the beef round steak!  My husband has always enjoyed his venison plain, but you should have heard the raves he gave this recipe.  He said it should be put on Page 1 of my personal cookbook.  It definitely is a #1.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I would highly recommend this if you're short on time and want something different.  I highly recommend it with the Sesame Chicken Pasta salad on this website, (ommiting chicken)as a wonderful side dish and with steamed oriental veggies.  Also I used a sirloin instead of round steak and had wonderful results!

I added only half the oil to reduce the fat and used sesame oil.  I also added some ginger and a couple of tablespoons of water.  I ran this through my WW points calculator and the sauce is about 2 points per serving!  I didn't include the meat as I served it as a sauce for stir fried veggies.  YUM!!

We loved this, especially my husband.  He couldn't get enough of it and has asked that I make it again.  I cut my meat into strips and marinated them for about 30mins and then cooked them in a skillet.  We had some extra sauce leftover which we used to dip in.

Based on the suggestions of others of you, I used 1/2 cup of soy sauce and 3 cloves of garlic, plus a large dollop of apricot preserves.  To reduce the fat and oil content it only needs 2-3 T of oil.  I like how it turned out with these adjustments.  Makes up quickly.

I love this recipe!  My whole family adores it.  When I make it, I skip the green onions and add regular onions, sliced.  I let it cook for a long time, and the sauce carmelizes.  It is very sweet, and we love it that way.

Used lite soy sauce.  Doubled all sauce ingredients except the sugar and was generous with the garlic.  My picky kids loved it!  Slice the beef thin and small for best flavor, as the thicker pieces were tougher and less flavorful.  Would be great with a vegetable added.  We served peas and rice on the side.

I have been making stir frys for several years.  These simple ingredients was probably the best tasting meat we've had.  I did add broccoli and slightly cooked the vegies, and served it over chinese noodles.  This is a keeper.

I made this in the instant pot. Used the sear function for searing the onion and meat. I dumped everything in on top of the meat & onions. I added the gravy mix, but not the extra water for the mix. Phenomenal. Going in to the rotation.

Delish. I did the recipe for 1 and 2/3 pound meat. After the meat was cooked, I removed it and put in stir fry Vegas and extra broccoli. I then served all that over brown rice.

The beauty of this recipe is not just the taste, but the simplicity of preparing the dish. Cut the beef against the grain and marinate for as long as you can (no more than 24 hours) to tenderize. Sweet tasting and quick to prepare. Serve with rice, green veg, and fresh strawberries. Next time I make it I will add red pepper flakes to my serving. The contrast of heat to sweet should be amazing. The whole family loved it and it's rare to get all five of us to like the same dish. A real keeper!

Lovely, basic recipe!  I added some sesame oil because I love that flavor.  Will not cook the meat as long next time, so it stays tender.

The sauce did not thicken as much as I thought it would but I used top sirloin beef. Also found the taste to be a bit bland. So now I would know to add more flavor.

A little too sweet for me.    After i put the rice and stir fry together i added a teaspoon of Kimchee sauce.... that made it better.

Made as is - great option if you are feeding kids or people who don't like spicy food. I served with the garlic edamame from the site to get some veggies in the meal.

So yummy. I made just a few changes per personal taste.  I doubled the sauce. I added a little corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce and added some green bell peppers and Sriracha for a kick. Family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

It's good, but it needs something. I forgot the onion, but other than that, the only thing I added were carrots & broccoli. I stir fried veggies separately & added them back in with the sauce & a little corn starch. Maybe chili flakes? More garlic, more soy?

I bought the meat I buy to make steak tips and used that. It was really really good! Served it with white rice and snow peas though I would have preferred sticky rice if I could have gotten it.

So simple!  I served with rice and steamed and seasoned broccoli.  I put the beef and the marinade together the night before and I think marinating for 24 hours made the beef incredibly tender.  I cooked in a wok and added a slurry of 1 Tbls cornstarch and 3 Tbls water to thicken a bit.  Not a necessary step, I just like it that way.

Really tasty!  I did as suggested and doubled all the ingredients.  I did not have vegetable oil so I used half sesame oil and half olive oil.  It came out super tasty.  My beef though was a little more chewy than I’d like.  Served this with broccoli over rice.

Very Tasty! I did not have green onions so I used white. I cooked the meat in batches so it wouldn't  steam it in the pan but brown. Also I used slightly less oil and cooked the remaining 
sauce pouring it over the meat and rice.

I made it but added ginger (about two teaspoons) and about a tablespoon of minced jalapeño to the marinade and omitted the sesame seeds altogether. It could of used a little more jalepeno. I served it on jasmine rice and some sautéed mixed veg. Amazing and the family loved it!

Sooooooo good and so easy!  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I doubled the sauce incredients but not the sugar.  I also used half sesame oil and half olive/canola oil.  I marinated the meat overnight .  I used sirloin steak and cut it into thin slices.  The meat was tender and the flavor was incredible!

I made this dish exactly how it said to make it but I must be missing something because it wasn't a creamy texture nor did it have the same texture in the video. I don't understand what I did wrong, the steak was basically in a oil bath I only could eat two bites.

I am not a great chef but have been trying to learn. This was an easy recipe and tastes amazing!  I added 1 top of saki and a top of sesame oil as I had no seeds. The left overs were even tender when reheated. Thank you for sharing!

Too much sugar, needs red pepper flakes and GARLIC.   Much more garlic.  Oh, and where is the fresh ginger.  Can;t have garlic w/o ginger in Szechuan cuisine.

Excellent sauce and I did cut down the sugar.  The recipe made enough sauce to coat the meat and the veggies I added; which is all I need for a stir fry.

Followed suggestions for a double batch for the veg. My husband actually said "it tastes better the next day". That made me laugh as many here have mentioned the same. I used it on salmon steaks last night, plates were cleaned!

This is a very easy recipe.  I did add a tsp of chile garlic paste in place of the plain garlic and that definitely kicked it up a knotch.  Will make this again & again.

This was a great dinner for me and two other people, I added extra soy sauce, and a little more sugar to add extra sauce, and it turned out great! The sesame seeds really adds to the flavor and I only wish I made more. This recipe also goes great with broccoli so I would recommend you also add that.

I made this with a few substitutions and like how it turned out. I used coconut oil instead and cut the sugar in half. I had plenty of marinade to also cook broccoli, onion and peppers, plus I threw in some zoodles at the end. I think i'd use a little cornstarch to help thicken the sauce for veggies next time.

Stars for easy but that's it. I made as directed and found the dish very bland and oily. We ate it but had to add more soy sauce to flavor it up.

Restaurant quality meal- made double the sauce but same sugar quantity.  Made with flank steak.  Didn't marinate ahead of time but let steak marinate in sauce first while prepared the rest of meal.  Used flank steak instead of round steak.  Prepared with kale peanut salad from this web site.

I made it with double marinade and soaked the meat for four hours. I cooked the meat very rare and set it aside. Stir fried carrots, broccoli and onions keeping them a bit crisp then added the meat to reheat. Toss in the seeds and served it over rice. Quick and easy and delicious.

Good standard recipe. Definitely double it so it can soak up into the meat. And marinade at least 24 hours! I made a second batch (not doubled) and added about 3 TBSP flour into it and poured that over the veggies after I sauteed them. Made a nice thick, delicious sauce that wasn't too salty (most jarred stir fry sauces are!).

Super easy and delicious! During the last few minutes of cooking, I threw in broccoli florets and they absorbed some of the flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as written.  I let it marinate for 30 min. and substituted  part of the oil for sesame oil as suggested. The sauce is delicious.  Will make this one of my weekday recipes.

Recipe was a bit sparse on details for me, I really don't know what I'm doing. Would be nice to know what temperature setting, do you use marinade while cooking?  Regardless, turned out tasty and even the picky eaters ate it.  I guess I didn't mess up too badly.

Doubled the sauce and paired it with a veggie stir fry over rice, I think next time I'll actually tripple the recipe and use it as the veggies sauce. I only used half the veggie oil and added in some sesame oil.

The recipe was amazing and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. And that's why I made it again a three days later but with a few differences. I used chicken breast instead of beef, cut into large slices, and before marinating I covered the pieces with salt, pepper, and flour. I then marinated the chicken (with the suggested amounts) for about ten minutes, I was in a hurry to make the food and thought it couldn't hurt to take it out before hand. Then I cooked the chicken and for the last ten minutes I added about five small mushrooms cut into slices and a small handful of celery. The sauce thickened nicely, because of the addition of the flour, and the dish went over very well with my family. My cousin actually asked me to make it again soon, and I've been trying for quite some time to find out what she likes. I will definitely look for other stir fry recipes similar to this!

This was really delicious. Next time I make it I will likely not add the sugar but that is just personal preference.  I marinated it about 10 hours (while I was at work) and it was wonderful.

I loved this! It definitely needs to marinate at least a few hours. I only marinated for around 45 minutes and was very good, but I can't wait to make it again and let it go maybe overnight!!!

Marinaded the round steak for 24 hours. Served with rice and Chinese veggies.  This was an easy, fast and tasty dish.

Hubby and I actually really enjoyed this.  I didn't have any green onions and I only marinated for 1/2 hour and it was fine.  Next time I'll get a nicer cut of beef  so that it's more tender.  Served over a bed of rice and steamed broccoli.  It was super yummy!

I read a lot of the reviews and it seems everyone did something a little different with this one.  I too, made a number of changes as follows:  I started with almost a pound of flat iron steak that I cut into thin slices while it was still partially frozen, which made it much easier to slice.  I doubled the marinade using half to marinade the steak and the other half to make a sauce after the meat was browned.  For the marinade/sauce I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar instead of white, and used 1 T. sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil.  When I was ready to cook, I drained and discarded the marinade from the steak.  Then I browned the meat and removed it from the pan.  To the hot pan I added the second half of the marinade and added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it.  I added the meat back and threw in some extra green onions that I had cut into 1” pieces, covered the skillet and let it simmer a couple of minutes, until the onions had softened.  I served this over rice topped with some toasted almonds instead of sesame seeds, and both Hubs and are were very happy.  He said “be sure and make this one again!”  I guess that says it all.  Five stars!

Couldn't eat it - through it all away.  Recipe didn't specify if you are to cook the beef in the marinate or not - I did but the meat was over done, tough and not flavorful. I also tripled the marinate to have enough. Just read other reviews that they used a better quality beef with better results so I may try this one again.

I agree with others and  would decrease sugar to 2 tablespoons and use stir-fry meat instead of round steak.  I only marinated for an hour. Definitely double the liquid recipe and add some cornstarch to thicken the liquid.  Very easy recipe

Modified it by doubling the sauce and added lots of red chilli flakes. Was very oily so ended up draining the sauce. Also added steamed broccoli and served on white rice! Delicious !!!

Easily 5 stars as made, but too sweet and too vague as written. I halved the sugar, stir fried the meat in vegetable oil and a little sesame oil, and reserved the marinade. Boiled marinade a couple of minutes in a saucepan, then added a slurry of 1 tbsp each cornstarch and water. Added back to the meat in the frying pan and simmered a couple more minutes. Will make this regularly!

Decent recipe as a guide line, i did a separate marinade with broccoli, mushrooms and celery. For the sauce i added ginger, paprika, some other tweaks.. And just a pinch of cornstarch. No sesame seeds they were not necessary. With some white jasmine rice turned out well family enjoyed it.

I Triple the marinade and use a bit less sugar... I also use blade steak and stock up when I find it on sale just for this recipe.  We marinate over night  with fresh garlic added to the recipe and after cooking toss in steamed broccoli and serve over fried rice.. Easy to make with STELLAR FLAVOR!

This is so simple and delicious. I didn't add the onions (because I was out) and cut the recipe from 4 to 3. It was perfect. The meat cooks so well and it's amazing flavor. Will make again!

Super easy and very yummy. I used half the sugar, 1 tbsp white sugar & 1 tbsp brown sugar. I used low sodium soy sauce.  Also doubled the marinade and used half for the beef and half for veggies. I cooked the beef and took it out of the skillet then cooked up the veggies and then added the beef back in.  At the end I added one more tbsp dark soy sauce with some flour to thicken up the sauce a bit.  Delicious and quick!

DELICIOUS!!!!! Thank you to the poster of this recipe. And I can't believe how quick and easy it was. I added green beans (thawed from frozen) - just plopped those in at the end when it was time for the sesame seeds. It was delicious. We had a ton so I was happy that we'd get a couple meals out of it - but between my husband and myself there were actually NO leftovers. I guess that would be my only complaint - that it was too good! We kept going back for seconds, multiple times!

I actually made this with venison (it's so hard to find good recipes with!) and added carrots, peppers, and snow peas. I tasted the sauce/marinade and thought it was a little bland, so I added a couple Tlbs of honey. Probably didn't need all the oil, but otherwise delicious!

I really loved this recipe.. It's simple and quick. I would reduce the oil a little next time and I added little flour to thicken sauce.

This was very good and we didn't find it too sweet.  I used top sirloin and marinated the steak for several hours.  I am making this again tonight and adding mushrooms, zucchini, and broccoli.

I thought it was too sweet and I only used 3 of the 4 tbsp. of white sugar called for, my husband thought it was fine. I also added two tbsp. of sesame oil and two tbsp. of canola oil which gave it the flavor I like ( 1 hr. in the marinade). The amount of sesame seeds was too much, I would cut it in half next time. I did toast the sesame seeds which added to the flavor. There wasn't the amount of sauce you normally have in Asian food but some added low sodium soy sauce will fix that! Over all great flavor in the marinade and I will make this again.

I made this recipe one and a half times and had plenty of sauce. I marinated the beef for 4-5 hours in the sauce ahead of time and added some veggies in the pan. The beef was tender and flavourful, but the dish overall was too sweet and way too greasy. If I were to make this again, I'd halve the oil (at least!) and lessen the sugar as well.

Recommended changes: 
Use sesame oil (and reduce by 3/4 to 1 tbsp)--and fiancé still said it had too much sesame flavor.
Reduce sugar by half to 2 tbsp. 
Steam half a bag of frozen sugar snap peas, onions, red and green peppers in the microwave. Add a few slivers of sliced fresh ginger. Add everything to meat/sauce combo and heat till warmed.
Maybe next time add something a bit sweet like pineapple or mandarin oranges? The beef needed something to lighten it up.

I made the marinade almost as in the recipe, only used 1/2 sesame oil and half veggie oil. I added a little bit of fresh ginger into the marinade. I used a lb. of flank steak, excellent meat for this. you want a meat with a lot of marbling. I added the green onions towards the end of cooking the meat. I did not use any sesame seeds.  I liked the sauce but do think if you want it to go over rice and veggies it needs more. the sauce kind of evaporated and reduced while stir frying the meat and got absorbed into the meat so not very "saucy." But I liked it. I made veggies in a seperate pan on the side: baby bok choy, sweet onions, baby zucchini and portabella mushrooms. served with white rice made in my rice cooker (my son does this he is 11yo).

This recipe popped up in my inbox last week. I had my 90 year old FIL coming over for dinner today so I doubled up the recipe and used round roast rather than steak. I cut back a wee bit on the garlic using the minced stuff from the bottle. Marinated 24 hours and I cooked the rice with beef broth and served the beef on top with a bit of the sauce. It was a hit, so tasty and everyone had seconds. It was a good thing I doubled up.

I made this and it turned out with a really nice flavor! I let the steak sit in the sauce overnight and then stir fried it for dinner and served it with white rice.  I used round steak as it was what I had on hand and the steak was tough. I would suggest using a different cut.  I should also mention I added some boiled sake and mirin to my marinade because there was not enough to completely cover the beef.

Super quick and easy! Awesome weeknight recipe. My family loved it and everyone I've padded the recipe on to has loved it as well. I found it a bit salty but switching to a low sodium soy sauce worked. I also reduced the sugar by adding 4 drops of liquid stevia then slightly thickening the sauce with 1/2 tsp of corn starch.

I made this tonight and had mixed feeling on this recipe. I didn't use round steak due to it being a tough meat. Ended up with 2 1/2 lbs of sirloin type cut. I came close to tripping the recipe and added about 1 tablespoon of sesame seed oil. I marinated just under an hour since I didn't have time to marinate it overnight. I used a big skillet and cooked it on medium heat at first and cooked in batches. The second batch, I ended up cooking it on medium high to get a better sear to it and smaller batches. Worked better but watch out for splattering. Here's where I have the mixed ratings for this. I wouldn't call this sesame beef since it closely taste like my mom's Korean Bulgolgi. The only thing that was missing is the beer to tenderize it. I'm also use to it being more crispy. I personally would rate it a 4 but bumped it up to a 5 since my husband and son devoured it.

We both really liked this dish. I made the dish as written - just enhanced it by doubling the sauce so that I could use half of it to cook julienned veggies in to serve with the meat. Will definitely make again. Perhaps next time with chicken or shrimp.

Great recipe after I modified it a bit! I added a little garlic powder, ginger and teriyaki (sorry, no  exact measurements). I served it over quinoa and I think it was better because of it.  Definitely  going in "tested best"!

I would definitely make this again...my kiddos just ate it UP!   I made a few adjustments to the recipe that were recommended in the reviews, i.e. purchased the pre-sliced stir fry beef from the grocery store, doubled the marinade and held some back for the veggies, used 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 4 in the marinade and used cornstarch to thicken up the sauce at the end of the cooking process.  I served it all over rice...wonderful tasting and so easy!

This was wonderful. Definitely a keeper. I did reduce the sugar. I also replaced some of the oil with sesame oil. I fried some green pepper, onions, to add to the meat. I had couscous in the fridge already so I used that in place of rice. Would be great with spring rolls, can't wait to do that. Some broccoli would pair up well. Thanks.

I doubled the recipe because I had almost 2 lbs. of top round but it was to oily for me.  Also I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp. and it was enough for me.  The flavor was good.  I usually sear meat in 1 or 1 1/2 tbsp. olive oil then braise for about 10-15 minutes in 1 cup of broth then add vegies then thicken with a little corn starch and water.  You don't have to braise if you use sirloin but round needs to be tenderized.  Also there was too much soy flavor for my taste.

Delicious!  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the marinade to use half as a sauce.  Sauted some chopped yellow pepper, onions & bean sprouts for a veggie side.

I was very happy with how good this was! Did a few tweaks to the marinade. Doubled it for one. And used coconut oil and a dash of red pepper flakes. I also kept the sugar at just 4 tablespoons. Sauteed one yellow and red pepper with it too. Served over white rice and it was amazing. Will make again.

This lacked flavor for us. We like a richer stir fry. Thanks for sharing.

Didn't like the marinade at all. I tried to follow the recipe exactly and we really didn't care for it. Won't be trying this again.

I followed everyone's advice and both doubled the sauce and cut the sugar way back.  Flavor was excellent and was an exact match to our favorite restaurant except it was too salty.  We ended up sprinkling sugar on it and stirring it in which made it much better.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.

This was pretty good, I did make a couple minor alterations.  I used sirloin, because thats what I had and i wanted to use it up.  I had 1.5 pounds of it, so I 1.5x the recipe (using 4 tbs regular soy sauce and 2 tbs low sodium).  Marinated it overnight with half a yellow onion (I forgot to get green onion).  Then when cooking it, when it was mostly done, I threw in a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.  And I guess I can't really call this sesame beef, because I didn't want to put any sesame on it.  Will be making this again.

This was pretty good, and I liked how easy it was.  I did add in some sesame oil, as the description suggests (though I would have preferred it mentioned directly in the recipe, since it wasn't on my printed version, and I don't take my computer to my kitchen to cook). I cut the sugar in half, which was the right sweetness for me (I don't like overly sweet main dishes), but the marinade was too salty, even using low-sodium soy sauce.  Some may argue that adding the correct amount of sugar would have remedied this, but so far, the only thing I've found that successfully lowers saltiness when the salt has already been added is marjoram (NOT sugar), and I didn't think marjoram would go very well with the rest of the flavors.  Overall, I liked it, but if I made it again, I'd alter it quite a bit.

Made this last night - it was very good, though I did add a splash more Worcestershire and soy once I tasted. The top round I used was fairly chewy, so we let it simmer in the sauce for probably an hour at least before it was getting tender and then we served with broccoli over rice. For quick stir frying I would probably use a more tender cut of meat, or cut the meat VERY thin next time (my husband diced the meat into fairly thick slices, so I think that's why it took so long to get them to where they weren't so chewy)!

Thank you!  I read reviews and reduced sugar by 25% and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I also did not have sesame seeds but did have sesame oil, so substituted 1/2 of the oil with sesame oil.  I imagine this duplicated the flavor.   Added fresh green beans at the end, although any fresh veggie would do.  Yes, round steak can be a little tough and needs longer simmering for tenderness.

Absolutely fantastic made AS IS. There is no need for all these changes- try the recipe as written- it is absolutely delicious! I doubled it (I have two teens!) and it was scarfed down. Hubby saved some for work the next day and continued to rave about it. I marinated it for about an hour and it was just great!! Reminded me a bit of bulgogi.

We really liked this.  I did use the stir-fry beef as some reviewers suggested.  It came out very tender.  I also doubled the marinade and used some to stir-fry the veggies.  I cooked the beef first and then removed it to a bowl, then cooked the veggies and added the hot veggies to the bowl with the beef.  This warmed the beef but didn't overcook it.  My picky kids liked it.

I used Ponzu in place of soy sauce because somehow I am out of soy sauce. I used 1 Tblspoon of splenda instead of the sugar and followed the directions other than that. I didn't double the marinade and I loved it as is. I served over Jasmine rice with snap peas.

Use boneless short rib thinly (1/4") sliced in long strips cross grain.  To marinade add some black pepper, thinly sliced green onion, exchange the vegetable oil for toasted sesame oil, exchange white sugar for brown sugar, add an equal amount of Sprite or little more than the soy sauce and marinade over night up to two days, you'll end up with a very tasty Korean BBQ.  To get the full flavor you'll need to BBQ it.  Don't forget the garlic!

I doubled the marinade as others recommended. The beef needs to be drained after cooking before adding the sesame seeds. The beef made a lot of liquid when cooked but I used flank steak instead. I also added baby corn, pineapple and julienned peppers to make this a more rounded meal by itself. Everyone loved it!

I think this kind of recipe needs to go with a certain kind of meet. I used top round steak and it dried a bit too much. I used one shallot instead of green onions and the flavor was very good. Thank you for sharing!

delicious.  we ended up marinating for 24 hours.  next time I'll probably add some red wine vinegar to help tenderize the meat.  we did use extra sauce but a little less sugar.

I ended up tripling the sauce to get enough to suit my liking.  I also added shredded carrots, broccoli, and sugar snap peas to add color and freshness.  Next time I will use a little less sugar in the sauce.  Very good, fast, and easy

I fixed this per the recipe except the sesame seeds at the end, my husband didn't think that sounded good so I figured I would see how it went without. Also, I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, I always think its better for chinese food and I spent quite a bit of money on a large container months ago and intend to actually use it! I didn't realize the meat needed to be marinated ahead of time so I only had it marinating for the 30 minutes. I began by stir frying a bag of stir fry veggies in peanut oil and then I added the beef and sauce. Yummy, we had a guest who really enjoyed it and wanted the recipe too.

Very delicious!! I did not have time to marinate overnight but 1 hour was good enough. I used sirloin that was on sale, sliced the meat thin myself - VERY TENDER! Added bokchoy because i need veggies with my chinese meal.   The beef was so tasty and we were so hungry that I didn't get a chance to take a picture. Picture posted was after the leftover sat on the fridge for hours - it still looks pretty good! Love this recipe!

I found this recipe on allreceipes and have been using it for around 4 years. It's absolutely delicious! My daughter was 3 when we gave it to her the first time, we told her it was "meat candy", because the meat is so soft and sweet. I use a lot less sugar, around an 1/8 of a cup based on a serving for 6. I have added ground chilies and sweet onions for a variation.

Exceptional, easy to cook meal.  I added stir fry vegetables with the same sauce (however, added some extra soy so the vegetables wouldn't overdo the flavor), and served it all over hot plain brown rice.  My girlfriend said that it would impress any date.  I am a very picky eater, and this one gets five stars for simplicity and taste.

I used vegetarian beef because my boyfriend and I don't eat red or white meat. I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and I added some sliced onions in addition to the green onions. Because I didn't have any sesame seeds, I replaced 1 tbsp. of the vegetable oil for sesame oil. I marinated the "beef" for half an hour. Towards the end of cooking the beef, I added some black pepper and it tasted great. Next time I will add some vegetables.

I don't know if it was the round steak or if I didn't marinate it long enough, but the meat was tough.  I thought the sauce was pretty boring. I just should have made my usual stir-fry sauce. I won't use the recipe again.

Just not the flavor I wanted. Don't know exactly what would have gotten it there. I prepared it with fresh snow peas and a little onion, still no help. Thanks anyway, this one just isn't for me but I'm glad some people like it.

This is excellent. I followed another recommendations and substituted 1 1/2 tbs of semsame oil for the vegetable oil and it was amazing. I used round steak and marinated yellow onions. I added some water chestnuts which added the finishing touch. I doubled the sauce recipe and thickened it with a constarch mixture. Will definitely be making this again. Can't wait to try it with green onions.

Needs something else to give it a bit more kick. We added asparagus and that was good, just need a bit more spice.

Absolutely delicious.  I used steak that was already cut up for stew.  Instead of scallions, I used 1/2 onion and i added asparagus.  Served over white rice, delicious.

Really good stir fry sauce. I TRIPLED the recipie (changed servings from 4 to 12) and I added fresh steamed broccoli, and there was plenty of sauce. I used regular onions instead of green onions, and much less sesame seeds than called for. Since I dont love beer, next time I'll try it with chicken.

Very good - I marinated the beef overnight, and also added steamed green beans for the last few minutes of stir-frying.  I served it over brown rice and it tasted like take-out!

This was delicious (although silly me forgot to add the sesame seeds at the end..oops!) I will definitely add them the next time I make this. I also added broccoli for a little added crunch and served over noodles. Hubby loved it too! Thanks for the recipe!

Try cooking some pea pods along with the beef. It adds some much needed green to the dish, plus they taste great. Make sure you let the meat marinate for a longer time, I only let it sit in the fridge for about an hour and the sauce separated back into oils and waters.

This recipe is awesome!  GREAT flavor and my husband even liked it even though he doesn't like homemade chinese.  My 3 year old ate so much of it I had to stop her!  It is really an easy recipe and with such a great taste it's a keeper!

My boyfriend really liked this recipe.  He said it reminded him of a dish his grandmother used to make.  I liked it, too but wasn't as enthusiastic.  It was a little too sweet and had a strange after taste.

this was pretty good as written. Next time I would do as others had suggested and add some cornstarch to make a thicker sauce. The sauce as the recipe is written is very watery.

I made this as a stir-fry with tofu (instead of beef), broccoli, snow peas, and carrots. Very simple, and better than take-out. I'm just wondering if there's a way to cut back on all that sugar and oil?

Great flavor.  Don't let marinate too long or the salt in the soy sauce will be overpowering.

this was really tasty.  i didn't think the beef turned out too tough.  i cooked the beef total about 5 minutes instead of 8.  i also used one T. less of sugar and it was still very yummy.  fixed with jasmine rice....delicious!

I liked the flavor of this marinade with beef very much, and I typically do not go for anything at all sweet with meat. I cringed a little, but added the sugar called for and was very pleasantly surprised with the results! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but didn't have sesame seeds. I substituted sesame oil for between 1/4 and 1/3 of the vegetable oil in the recipe. I let my beef round pieces marinate around 45 minutes and they tasted great! Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll probably double everything but the oil for more of a sauce for my vegetables/rice, and I'll try tenderizing and "velveting" the beef.

The beef came out a little tough but it was still good. I added steamed broccoli at the very end. Served this with Brazilian white rice from this website.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I like that I can use it with just about any type of meat.  The recipe does not call for it, but we add asparagus and eat it over white rice.

I followed others advice and doubled the sauce~ marinade, I also on advice of others halved the sugar for half white sugar and half brown sugar. I just wish I would have listen to the other reviews which told you to use a better cut of meat, I used the top round the recipe stated and even after marinading for almost 8 hours still found it tough. Next time I will definitely use a better cut of meat. The recipe was Delicious though and my husband and 14 year old loved it. My son made a point to tell me how much he loved the dinner which is unusual in this house. The younger three 10, 8 and 8 though turned their noses up at it and refused to try a bite, but most night they refuse to try my cooking unless it is pizza, chicken nuggets or mac & cheese so don't let that sway your decision to try this recipe. A must keep recipe! Delicious just following the recipe exactly or there is so much to work off just using the basic ingredients!

Delicious!  I will make less sauce or use more meat next time.  I probably didn't have quite a pound, it was in grams here.  I dumped all of the marinade in the wok, it was so runny, the sesame seeds didn't really stick to the meat.  So I would probably just take the meat out of the marinade and stir the seeds into the meat while in the wok.  It tasted great!  My whole famil LOVED it.  My husband thought it was take out!

This is one of my favorite beef stir fry dishes to make.  Its easy and very tasty.  Just dont overcook your beef! Another thing I like to do is make extra sauce and stir fry my veggies seperate and then add them at the end with the beef when they are nice and tender.

We loved this recipe.  The only complaint I have is that it is very oily.  I left out a bit of the oil and added some lemon juice to the marinade.  I also left out one tablespoon of sugar.  I doubled the sauce for veggies.  I cooked up the meat, then stirfried some brocolli, sugar snap peas, onion, and mushrooms.  I also added some sesame oil to the pan for flavor.  My husband loved the sweet sauce.  I prefer spicy, so I added spicy chili sauce to mine and served over brown rice.  Will definently make again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

It is good if you are looking for a sweet stir fry. I cut back on the sugar by 1 Tbls, and it was still pretty sweet.  If you are looking for spicy (which apparently I was), you may want to add garlic chili paste to the marinade.  Thanks for sharing.  Definitely kid friendly.

This is very good. It's not like the sesame beef you would get in a restaraunt, but it makes a great basic sweet stir-fry sauce. I marinated the beef overnight but didn't see much difference (the meat itself was kind of tough and not too flavorful). But, I made a seperate batch of the marinade and stirfried the veggies in it and that was awesome. I would deffinately use ther marinade as a sauce for stirfry again.

Very simple & very tasty.  Next time we will double or triple the sauce & marinate.  We made this with chicken, brocoli, carrots & onions.  It was excellent & so easy!  Thanks!

This was good.  My 9 y/o daughter even said it was the best dinner I ever made.  I, too, doubled the marinade for the veggies.  I added broccoli which I blanched first.  It was a huge hit and I'll definately be making again. Thanks for the great recipe

Like someone else said, it smelled great to cook but I thought the flavor was overall pretty bland.  If it weren't for mixing rice into the mixure at the end i would say I definitely wouldn't make it again, but the jasmine rice soaked up a lot of the spicy and was quite tasty.  Great for lunch the next day too.

Very good--I added cornstarch to the sauce, which makes it just like chinese food you get from the store, but don't use too much or it gets sticky/chunky.  (Maybe about a tablespoon).  I also doubled the soy sauce and oil to make sure there was enough sauce for the veggies I added, and next time I make this I will not add more oil--it was too oily.  I might even try less oil than the recipe calls for.  But this is a very simple recipe for a delicous meal!  My husband says, "YUM!"

This recipe was real close to what I get at the restaurant, but made some changes... took our the sesame ... sorry i know that's what it's called... but i don't like the flavor much... kept everything else the same... just added shallots, mushrooms, red and green bell peppers.  I loved it, just found it too sweet and oily.  I think next time I'll cut the sugar and oil down to 2 tbsp. to take out some of the oiliness and sweetness of the dish.  Otherwise great recipe... will cook this again!

I agree with some of the other reviewers-the sugar makes for a flavor that I don't really care for.  I prefer my stir-frys to taste salty rather than sweet. I also thought the meat could have used some tenderizing beforehand as well.

Wow! This is good! I added sesame oil during the cooking time and also used low sodium soy and it turned out great! I added asparagus and broccoli(the old stand by's)and also served it over brown rice. It is a keeper.

We make this a lot - usually marinate it overnight and I always use Splenda rather than sugar. Like another reviewer, I also throw some asparagus in to the stir-fry towards the end. Fabulous!!

This recipe was great, no leftovers and family asked for it again. The marinade is perfect and the beef comes out tender.

This is totally delicious. I didn't change a thing, except I added fresh green beans. Next time I will try to add corn starch to the marinade at the end. Very good!

The marinade made the round steak very tender and flavorful. This is a good asian dish I will make again.

my husband is a huge fan of sesame beef, so I thought I would try it out home.  This is such a simple recipe!  I can't believe I haven't tried this before.  I let it marinate for about 1 hour and I think it should really have been over night.  But it still tasted great, even my kids ate it!

I made this recipe with chicken instead of beef and asparagus instead of green onions (hey it's what I had in the fridge!) and it was so good.  I thought the sauce could have been a little thicker, so maybe next time I'll thicken with a little cornstarch, but it got raves at my house.

What a shame this can't be rated higher than 5 stars.  We absolutely loved this recipe, one of the best stir fry recipes I do.  I also did as some other reviewers suggested and doubled up on the marinade and used half to stir fry the vegetables, this is finger licking good sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This meal was perfect! I made it for my fiancé and I, it was Yummy.  My fiancé brought the leftovers to work, and his coworkers smelled it and said "I didn't know your wife was Asian." (I'm not).  We took that as a huge compliment!

When making this I added the ginger, and cut down on the sugar, as per some suggestions by other reviewers. I was glad I did both! Unfortunately, I still found this to be more bland than I expected. This recipe would be handy if you want to make something that's fairly quick and easy, and if you like a simpler tasting beef dish. It just wasn't what I was looking for; I will continue searching for a sesame beef recipe that really wows me!

This was quick and easy. I followed a lot of the other suggestions, ie halved the sugar, added ginger, sesame oil etc and served it with a variety of lightly cooked green veges. Impressed my VERY fussy husband, who said it was all right, then promptly cleaned up any left overs, including all veges, as well as the bowl!

Good recipe for a quick meal.  I substituted some sesame oil for the vegetable oil to truly make it taste like sesame.   Next time, I will substitute some honey for the white sugar as some suggested.

I found this recipe at allrecipes about a year ago, prior to the Chinese New Year.  It is truly delicious, easy and tastes entirely authentic.  I passed the recipe on to some friends and got rave reviews.  One friend of mine grills the marinated steak during the summer months and it is great as well.  I am getting ready for our at-home Chinese New Year celebration for this year and the sesame beef will be the centerpiece!

My family loved this recipe! I did take the advice of buckwheat05 and used 2 tbsp of honey in place of the white sugar. Also, I added a touch (1 tbsp.) of rice vinegar to the marinade as well. I let the meat marinate for about 4 hours. Also, I sliced the meat into strips as well to help penetrate the meat. MMMM....good!

Wonderful dish-very easy.  Lacking time, I only marinated 20 minutes, and it still turned out well.  Also added julianned carrots and yellow onions.  Broccoli would also be good.  Definitely recommended!

This recipe was good - easy to do and tasted great.  My husband gave it 5 stars but I rated it 4 - felt it needed a little more punch.  Maybe some more garlic or some ginger - something just a little stronger.  It smelled great marinating and the meat cooked up tender.  I served it with some stir-fry veggies and rice.

I personally loved this but my husband said is was "lacking a flavor" but failed to tell me what.  Definatly a 5 star for simplicity!  I added some chicken stock/ cornstarch slurry to the sauce after removing the meat to make a gravy and cooked some frozen vegetables in that. Delicious!  Even kids loved it.

This was wonderful!  Everyone loved it!  I didn't have green onions or sesame seeds and it was still terrific!  I tried it with chicken, too, and it made probably the most tasty, tender chicken I have ever had.  Yum!  I made an extra batch of the marinade and added about 2T cornstarch.  Then I threw it in with frozen stir-fry vegetables after the meat cooked and let the vegetables get crisp-tender.  It makes a very tasty sauce.  GREAT RECIPE! Thanks!

Pretty good.  Made extra marinade to serve with rice and lots of veggies (mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, onion, & bell pepper).  I had some trouble telling when the meat was done because the marinade turned the raw beef into the same color as the cooked meat and so some of it ended up under-cooked.  I was making an extra pound and cooking in a wok so the beef was not all touching the hot surface at the same time.  Just an FYI to keep in mind.  Good flavor, will try again.

The sauce is so delicious.  I only used 3/4 of the sugar that it called for because I didn't think it needed so much.  Also since I'm vegetarian I used a bag of Morning Star "Steak Strips".  My non vegetarian friends loved it.  I also added broccoli and bell pepper.  You can really add any vegetables you want.

I really liked this, but I don't think my husband cared for it that much.  He's not a big fan of sweetened meat.

Tasted good, tender. Only changes I made were garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, and I used sesame oil, omitted the sesame seeds. The sesame oil brings a unique flavor to the meat. I might try it again, since it uses items I keep in the kitchen anyways.

Delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the marinade and sesame seeds.  I stir fried the meat in the sauce and I added 1/2 box of frozen broccoli along with the sesame seeds to the stir free for the last two minutes of cooking.  Next time I'll add the whole box.  Yum!

Very good! I doubled the sauce to serve over rice. Next time I will try a little less oil. I skipped the seeds because we didn't have them and added snow peas..YUM! We ate it again as leftovers the next day and it was delicious :) Thank you for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe about 6 times.  My favorite way is with pork.  I usually double the sauce and add steamed broccoli.  Sometimes I add mushrooms and steamed carrots too.  GREAT!

Excellent!!!  I added the green onions as a garnish at the end because I like fresh green onions.  I also put the beef on top of a bed of stir fried bok choy.  Easy and delicious.

I thought this made a great marinade/sauce.  I did use chicken (all I had on hand) and skipped the sesame oil/seeds (just not big fans). Also, added California veggie mix at end. Will use again. Served with fried rice. Thanks!

My husband loved this recipe. I sauteed the beef (and sauce) in 1 Tbsp canola + 1 Tbsp sesame oil for about 4 minutes, then removed the meat. I then sauteed some red peppers, and broccoli for about 3-5 minutes, then added the beef back. I then added the sesame seeds and cooked a couple of minutes. I served it over steamed brown rice. Over all a good meal, but for me it was WAY too salty for me. next time I will use a low sodium soy sauce.

This was pretty good.  I did increase the sauce but reduced the sugar and it was still a little too sweet, but overall we enjoyed it.  When I cooked the meat, there was a little more liquid then I expected from the meat so I added a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also sprinkled some sesame oil on top for flavor after it was cooked.  Also, next time I will probably toast the sesame seeds a bit before adding them. Just to intesify the flavor.  Served with white rice, broccoli and red peppers.  We will make this one again.

HIGHLY recommed following the recipe exactly!  I used 4 tbl. brown sugar and 4 tsp white sugar to marinate the beef.  The brown sugar kept it from becoming too sweet but without the additional white sugar it would carmalize the sauce.   My husband ate it but wasn't overjoyed with it.  It came out eatable.  I am going to try it again but I think even with all the white sugar it's not the restaurant style recipe most are probably looking to prepare.

This recipe is really tasty, and pretty simple to make.  I marinated the meat over night, and I think the soy suace might have darkened the meat, but other than that, I'd make this again, maybe just not marinate the meat for quite so long next time.

If you really like intense sesame flavor, I'd suggest using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil with is really light and neutral.

This recipe was actually very good.  It did have a bit too much of a sesame taste to it so next time I will decrease the amount of seeds in the dish.  As others have said, this sauce would work well with chicken and, I think, pork.

Well, this was just okay.  I ran out of soy sauce, and ended up using stir-fry sauce instead, then cut out half the sugar.  I also think I made the beef pieces too big.  I think next time, I'll try adding some veggies and making it more according to the recipe.

Yummy! This was a tad on the sweet side, but we love sweet (especially my 6 year old)
I did substitute one tbsp of the oil for Sesame oil. 
I served it with steamed white rice and brocolli. IT was really easy to prepare, too.. which is always a +++

This was fabulous!  Literally the only change I made was to throw in some dried minced onion instead of the green onion.  I let it marinade overnight in a plastic bag and cooked it up the next day with some broccoli.  It was wonderful and I liked it even better than the local restaurant's version because I know exactly what is in it.  Hubby even enjoyed this and he's super picky!  Thanks for a GREAT and easy recipe!

I make this recipe with chicken instead of beef, omit the seeds but replace a bit of sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil and the kids love it!

This recipe is a big hit with my family - including my 3 year old!  I use toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and half brown sugar, half white based on the recommendations here.  The meat has a great flavor - especially if you have the time to let it marinate over night.

Absolutely delicious!  It was so easy to make and so quick yet tasted gourmet!  My husband loved it.  Next time I will double the recipe though because we had no leftovers!

I used sirloin and rib eye steak so the meat was really tender, the marinade was really tasty.  Enjoyed it.

I used sirloin steak thinly sliced and it had good flavor but turned out somewhat dry by the time it arrived at the table.

Very good!  You can add almost any kind of vegetable to this.  The sauce was very good.  I added fresh mushrooms (sliced) and I didn't have any broccoli but I added some asparagus (cut into 1 inch peices).  Served with egg rolls.

This was quite good.  I sauteed some snow peas and water chestnuts.  I then used seasame oil instead of regular oil and followed the rest of the directions accordingly.  I added the snow peas and water chestnuts right at the end.  The meat was nice and tender and the sauce was excellent.  Thanks Lynn.  We will be making this again!

I doubled the sauce and used 1 1/2 lbs of steak, stirred in a head of chopped, steamed broccoli and steamed baby carrots at the end. I also made one more batch of the sauce in case anyone wanted to spoon extra over thier rice. (I just boiled the sauce ingredients in a skillet until it was incorporated.) I gave it to my husband to take to work to feed "the guys".  They loved it.  One guy ate so much that he said his stomach hurt, so perhaps this should only be served to friends with self-control :).

I enjoyed the taste but was not pleased with the texture of the meat.  I usually have problems when it comes to round steak and always find it a little too tough.  I really like the marinade and would consider using it on other cuts of meat.  I wonder how chicken would work?  Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best beef recipes I've tried.  It is so fast and easy.  I have the recipe memorized because I make it so much.  I use light soy sauce and reduce the oil to 2 tbsp.  No need to measure the onions or garlic. . . there can never be enough.  My husband's friend requests this whenever he is in town.

Great stir-fry.  Used brown sugar instead of white and added broccoli.  Next time will cut back on sugar and oil.

I've made this a few times and it's always great. I double the sauce to pour over rice.  Overall a great, quick, affordable meal that everyone I've served it to agrees is delicious!

This was great!  I used 1 1/2 lbs of steak, one entire bunch of green onions, and it was excellent!  Just enough sauce for that amount of meat.  Thanks!

I also did as some others suggested and doubled the marinade/sauce so there would be extra over the rice.  I also took two other suggestions and used half brown sugar and half white, and also added a package of oriental style veggies for the last 2-3 mins of cooking (but without these differences it still would have been delicious).  This recipe was very good, and my hubby and kids even liked it and they aren't usually into this type of meal.

I wound up adding a little extra garlic, that was my only change, and everyone in the family liked this dish.
