I just went apple picking with my kids a couple days ago, and this recipe saved the day. My kids somehow talked me into getting way to many apples, and I had no idea what to do with them until I came across this recipe. I had already made apple pie, apple jelly, and applesauce, so I was looking for one more creative thing to do with the leftover apples! This was a perfect match, and was fantastic!! I was able to make these tart-like treats pretty quickly, and even my pickiest eater was satisfied with them. These are something I'm planning on making again and again and I would highly recommend them! Just do me a favor and try this recipe, you'll be amazed at how good these desserts are!

I have to admit, I used this recipe more for the method than the actual recipe, however, these were DELICIOUS! Instead of using fresh apples, I used apple pie filling and just added cinnamon and walnuts to it, which worked out fine (though it turned a weird color for some reason, lol, but still VERY yummy). I'm gonna warm some later and top them with ice cream and caramel sauce....mmmm.  I can't wait to try other fruit fillings in these. A super simple warm pie~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
