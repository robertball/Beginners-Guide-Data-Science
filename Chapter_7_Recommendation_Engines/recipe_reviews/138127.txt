This was really delicious. Due to the comments of others, I reduced the tomato by half and I found that proportion tasty. I used about 2 cups of ricotta in place of the paneer - it was very creamy but delicious. I also didn't find I needed to simmer the tomato sauce for an hour - I did just about hald an hour.

This was a great dish! The only things I had to change was to add more vegetabes-I think the spinach could have been doubled. This recipe is also different from the palak paneer that I usually have in the restraurants, as it has a tomato base and is not creamy. Overall, a good dish with authentic flavors. thanks!

"Rosy" is right... as in red and tomatoey! Palak paneer is green, right?? We've never had palak paneer that looked or tasted like this in a restaurant. It was our first time trying to make palak paneer and it is hard to imagine how this recipe can create GREEN palak paneer! With all the tomato paste and ginger called for, we ended up with a very red gingery dish that tasted good... but not really like palak paneer.  Suggest really cutting the tomato, cutting the ginger, and upping the spinach! Still tasty though!

This recipe was delicious.  I made paneer using buttermilk and milk and it really made the dish.

The recipe calls for too much tomato. I even added another package of spinach, because most reviews say that the recipe could use more spinach, but it still didn't cut the tomato taste. Could have used a little more spices too. It's a tad different than what I've had at Indian restaurants.

This gave great basic form to the palak dish.  I followed other reviewers suggestions regarding ratio of tomatoes and spinach and made these changes: used canned chopped tomatoes (15 oz.), a whole box of fresh spinach, veggie broth instead of water, made the garam masala from scratch.  The results were fantastic and perfect over fresh homemade naan.  Give it a try to grill your naan and it tastes like fire roasted indian street food!  Delicious.

Made the dish as directed, but found it a little bland. Something was missing but I'm not quite sure what it was... less tomato? add some cream? more spices? I doubt I'll make it again, it just wasn't as good as what I get at the restaurant.

I completely agreed with bmotzbmotz. This was tasty but didn't taste (or look) like any Palak Paneer I've ever gotten before. I couldn't find paneer so I used ricotta. This could be a factor so I'll try to find it (or maybe to make it) and try the recipe again.

This was awesome.  I made it as listed, except I only added 1/2 lb. paneer, as that was all I had.  I was great on basmati rice.  Yum!!

This is so good! I rushed it because I was starving, but it was still delicious! Next time I will let it simmer for the hour as suggested. Follow the directions well, I can tell I didn't saute the onion long enough and the spices didn't have time to blend as well as I know it could have. Next time, I will get this ready in advance so I have enough time. I would also reduce the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon, because it was way too salty. I also added two shakes of cayenne pepper. This was perfect over basmati rice.

This was really good! I modified it by using vegetable stock instead of water, made my own garam masala (couldn't find it), added 3 T of it, too, used fresh spinach (1/2 of which I used hand-blender on for better consistency), 1/2 of tomato paste (afraid of it being too tomatoey), a bit of chicken stock (sorry vegetarians!) and that's about it.

I used butter and ground dry cumin and ginger as well as dehydrated crushed up onion. Simmered for about 1/2 an hour. Delicious! I had never had tomato based palak paneer but it is just as good in its own way as the creamy based one. i used homemade paneer -adding it at the very end and heating it only briefly as not to melt it- might try frying it first in butter next time to help hold it up.

I generally like this, but will probably make several adjustments next time I make it. I do think the proportions are a bit off. Definitely could use more spinach and garam masala and less paneer (if only to cut the fat) and maybe also tomato paste. I also added some red pepper flakes for extra flavor, which I'll keep in future editions.

delicious!  we love indian food and this seemed very authentic.  i didn't know how to clarify butter, so just used plain butter.  less tomato, more garam masala, lots of spinach, and chicken boullion (i add this to almost everything to add more flavor).  i also added cayenne and a bit of cinnamon.  the cinnamon somehow balanced out the tomato flavor a bit.

I found this needed about twice as much spinach and half as much paneer, but it was otherwise delicious!

fresh spinach would have tasted so much better.  it tasted nothing like the palak paneer from the store.  The store bought frozen ones probably did better justice.  Sorry.

I reluctantly tried this recipe thinking there was no way it could taste as good as at the restaurant.  It turned out excellent!  Thank you very much Rosy.  The only change I made was to put Panela cheese because I can't find Paneer.  It melted quickly, so I would recommend refridgerating it first, and then sticking it in just when serving the dish, so the cheese stays in cubes and doesn't melt.

This was absolutely delicious!
I always order palak paneer when I go out, but I've never made it myself before and I'm so happy I finally did! The spices combined with the ginger turn out to be wonderfully fragrant and beautiful. The only changes I made were that I used butter instead of ghee, I used fresh spinach, and I put everything in the blender right before adding the paneer, which made it look and taste much more like the restaurant dish. Yummm

Be sure to use ghee. And don't try to get fancy and use fresh spinach. You will save yourself time by using the frozen. Oh and I use a bit more tomato paste because my frozen spinach comes in a 16 oz. package.

really liked this recipe. had all the ingredients in-house which is always a big consideration. I used crushed tomatoes instead of paste (didn't have paste). like many others mentioned, the spinach is not enough so I added some frozen peas which went well with the spinach and paneer. I also added a can of coconut milk which made the dish creamy and rich -- much like in restaurants. my two little girls loved it!

This recipe is perfect as is.  If you're feeling especially ambitious, try to make the paneer from scratch too.  The only ingredients are milk and lemon juice.

I agree that this has different coloring than the typical palak paneer.  Also other versions  I have used call for blending the ingredients in a blender once flavorshave married.  No a bad flavor, just a different appearance and texture.

Good with a bit of adjustments. As per other reviewers, I halved the tomato paste and double the amount of spinach in the recipe. Omitted the cilantro cus didn't have any but still tasted great. Served with saffron rice and curry!

Not an overwhelming list of ingredients and easy to prepare. Delicious on a cold day with a warming dahl and rice, or naan if you're a northern food lover. I am.

WOW! terrific! I substituted the paneer for a can of chick peas and we really liked the flavor and heartiness of this side dish. I suppose you could just throw your diced grilled chicken in for a one dish meal. I loved it!

Fabulous! I have found that when I use a recipe with cumin seed (or ground cumin) I heat the seeds in a dry pan on the stove until they brown lately and release their fragrance. Then pour them in a mortar and grind them. Well worth the effort!

Very delicious and authentic tasting. It tastes like the food that my bf's indian family serve when we go to their house. At first i thought that putting in a whole bulb of garlic was too much, but it really isn't, i guess simmering it all for one hour mellows out the taste. I minced the garlic in an electric chopper, which was a really good idea i think so you don't bite into little bits of garlic, it just melds into the sauce. Also, I followed other reviewers' tips to add only half the tomato sauce, the flavor was just right. Also before serving, i adjusted the taste, adding one tsp salt with the garam masala.

A great easy recipe to introduce my family to a new dish, with new flavors (for us). I used half the tomato paste, and bought real Paneer, but I totally think firm tofu could be substituted easily in a pinch. Really had to watch the water content when the sauce was simmering, and the spinach soaked up even more, so I had to keep adding water to make it nice and saucy. Wonder if veggie broth would help to not water down the spices? I didn't realize until the end that I forgot the cilantro, but it went over great without it! Served with warm garlic naan.

I felt the end product was bland. I added regular curry powder and chili powder. I added milk and like another review 4-5 extra C of water. It is a great one to build off of. I would have had no idea where to start and this put me in the right direction.

This recipe was very good.  Although, I agree it is different than palak paneer in a restaurant. I added the two dashes of cayenne pepper as recommended by someone else as well as a bit more spinach.

This. Is. The. Best. Recipe. Ever!
It was so easy and sooo good.
I thought the texture of the cheese was better than at our local Indian carry out!
Only one thing- maybe I was simmering the sauce at too high a temperature, but I ended up adding 4-5 extra cups of water, and it was still quite thick (which I like.)

Followed suggestions of reducing the tomato paste, pan fried the paneer cubes before adding, and I'll admit I did not simmer the sauce for a whole hour but it was still quite tasty IMHO.

It was great! I made it according to the directions, but next time I will add more spinach as other reviewers recommended, and that way I'll have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch, too. I added my homemade paneer to my plate at serving time in order to monitor how much I actually consumed so I could count my calories accordingly.

Following other suggestions, I halved the tomato paste,  added less ginger, coconut milk  for creaminess and chicken stock.  I also added peas instead of spinach, due to preference. This is a very flavourful recipe but it needs more sauce!  I added quite a bit more water and liquid (coconut milk) than suggested and it still needed more - something to keep in mind if you're letting it simmer for a long time.

The basics are almost all there but some big things needed tweaking. Usually when I make curry I put the cumin seed in first and then the onion.  Cooked that until golden brown.   Then the garlic. I also added some chilis because I like it hot. Then I added some more seasonings like cumin, coriander and chili powder but that is personal preference.  I usually put the garam masala in with two minutes cook time left but doing it this way did not make much of a difference.  The paneer I usually prep by cooking for a minute in oil or soaking in warm water until soft before throwing it in the curry.  But the biggest thing is the tomato paste.  I am not sure if this is what your friend meant but usually when Indians say tomato paste they mean tomatoes than have been blanched and pounded/processed in to a paste.  A can of crushed tomatoes would have a closer consistency to what it sound taste like.  The tomato paste just ruined the whole dish in my opinion.

I doubled the recipe minus the tomato paste, just put in 1 can. I also made my own paneer. It was okay, nothing great. I don't think I would make it again. For as much work as I put into it making the paneer, and then having it come out so so, it wasn't worth it. Like others said there was something missing but I dont know what it was. I'm not a stranger to cooking Indian food but I still couldn't figure out what this dish needed.

Tasty! I didn't have ghee so just used butter, and instead of tomato paste, used fresh tomato chopped and a little V-8 juice I had on hand. I used frozen spinach in the bag and left out the cilantro (none around) and the extra tsp. of garam masala. It is deliciously gingery. I don't know understand the criticisms about the tomato flavour - I have seen other paneer recipes using tomato and spinach.

I thought it was a great recipe. I changed a few things though. Instead of ghee, I used olive oil to be healthier. I doubled the spinach and cut the tomato paste in half. I also cut the simmering time in half. Served over rice it was delish :)

This was good, but there was an ingredient missing.  Maybe my modifications were at fault?  But I doubt it.  I used margarine for ghee, about 3 tablespoons of ginger, only half of the required tomato paste, only 1/2 tsp salt (though I think 1 tsp would have been better), only about 3/4 cups water, fresh spinach, and chicken instead of paneer.  With all these modifications you might blame me for thinking the recipe wasn't perfect, but really, there was something missing in the spices.  It tasted great but next time I'll experiment with perhaps some curry and coconut cream.  Thanks for a great base recipe though!

Wonderful! My first attempt at Indian cuisine and it was exactly like my favorite restaurant! I followed the recipe completely and wouldn't change a thing. Served over basmati rice with homemade naan and paneer (also from this site). Will definitely make again!

Fantastic flavors!  I have never cooked with cumin seed before, and thought about just using ground cumin (because that was what was in my pantry) - I stuck with the seed the way it was written.  I only needed to add about 2 cups of water while it was cooking to keep it at the right consistency. Some reviewers said they needed more like 4-5, but I did not find that to be the case for me. I did use the whole 6 oz can of tomato paste, and it tasted delicious.  I used fresh ginger, but wondered what it would taste like with ground ginger, as I don't normally have fresh on hand. Anyone try that?  Excellent recipe. Thanks for posting!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!   I added more spinach, but other than that it was perfect.  I love Indian food and this was very authentic tasting.  Thank you so much.

Oh yes!!!  I wish I'd had the homemade paneer but had to use large curd cottage cheese.  Per another reviewer I used half the tomato paste and used 16 oz. of spinach.  This tastes just like the export package I used to use and is absolutely delicious.  Even hubby, who is not a spinach fan, loved it as did my 10 year old finicky granddaughter!

This was an easy recipe to follow and the result was a big hit. The flavors were rich. I added two chilis because I like hot and spicy. They didn't overwhelm the dish either. I liked this a bit better than the Palak Paneer we get at our local restaurant as it wasn't as greasy.
