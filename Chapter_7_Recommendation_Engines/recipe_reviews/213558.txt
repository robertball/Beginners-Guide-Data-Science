I took the suggestion of using individual tortilla chips. I used Tostitos scoops. They were perfect .

Pretty, Simple, Tasty! I made as stated and put them in mini muffin tins. I also added shredded imitation crab meat (1 cup) so this made 18 filled tarts for me. The crab meat and the peppers were great together and very attractive and gave it a little more filling. They were gone in an instant.  Can't wait to serve them again.

I thought 2 jalapenos would be too hot, but it needed both. I also found it needed a little garlic salt as it was a lacking a little something. I usually love phyllo shells, but for this recipe, I think I would bake on individual tortilla chips next time. A wonderful foundation...and the mixture was even better after refrigerating for a few days. The bacon is a great bonus (I used real instead of bacon bits). Thanks for a fun idea!

We LOVED these!  The only phyllo shells I can buy come in packs of 15.  I doubled this recipe for 60 tarts and had just enough filling.  It can be a bit tedious filling the shells, so next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I'll pipe the filling in.  I made these ahead of time w/no issue.  We didn't use them all, so I froze the extras in the Phyllo tart trays in a Ziploc for future use.  Good stuff!  Surprisingly, I actually preferred the tray I made bacon-less to the ones topped w/bacon bits.  THANKS, for a great appetizer recipe, Jessina!

Awesome recipe! I ended up using phyllo cough and using a regular side cupcake pan. Therefore, I doubled the recipe. I also added more Jalapeno's. Everyone LOVED this recipe! Will  make many more times. Thanks for sharing.

This is the most fantastic appetizer I have ever made. I have to make double the recipe (it's more convenient since cream cheese comes in 8 oz instead of 4) but in order to accommodate, I used 6 peppers, and 2 cups of shredded cheddar over 30 cups (the packs come in 15 where I buy them) and just left out the hot sauce. Even will all the changes, it still turned out GREAT. And unlike store-bought jalapeno poppers, these require not ranch to serve with.

These were so easy and EVERYONE loved them! I even had 3 people ask for the recipe before I left the party! Anything with less than 6 ingredients is on my list of the best recipes to have, and with the rave reviews, you can count on me doing this one over and over again! I made the filling the day before and kept it in the fridge overnight. I took it out to get to a "spreadable room temp" and just before the party popped it in the oven! EASY!!!

Absolutely delicious (from a traditional popper lover)! I had a jar of diced jalapenos in my fridge, so I used those instead of fresh jalapenos. I wasn't sure of the translation from fresh jalapenos to jarred, but I used too much (5 tablespoons) and they were delicious but just a tiny bit too spicy for my (and a few others at our party's) taste. Will definitely make these again, probably with 3 tablespoons of diced jalapenos. I wasn't sure what "hot pepper sauce" was (hot sauce?), but we had an open bottle of Footy's wing sauce and I used that, and it was great. We served it with habanero jelly (not very spicy on its own), and the sweetness combined with the spiciness is amazing! Love this recipe - they are addicting and definitely beware of the molten factor when they first come out of the oven!!

I love this recipe! It is the second time I've made them this week. So easy and less messy than actual poppers.  The first time I made them I could not find pastry shells so I got phyllo dough sheets and made pouches instead. Worked fairly well, a few overflowed and the pouch did not hold. But this is a great recipe. I also added a tad bit of garlic powder, but I am a huge garlic fan.

The filling was very good, but they do not set well for a party, because they must be eaten hot. If you plan on eating these within 10 minutes of pulling them out of the oven, then you’ll enjoy them.  I doubled the recipe, so I had left over filling.   I baked the left over filling and served with chips the next day.  This was much better!  Also, I substituted some smoked Gouda cheese for the bacon bits since I am a vegetarian. This gave I a very nice Smokey flavor without the meat.

My husband and I thought these were to die for!!!!  I also used the tostito scoops b/c I already had them on hand and prefer the taste to phyllo cups.  I made two batches, one with fresh jalapenos and one with jarred and preferred the jarred ones because they were hotter and not "crunchy" and they were perfect ;) thanks for a great recipe thats delicious, spicy and easy!!!

Very nice indeed.  I liked not trying to stuff peppers but having a neat to eat snack to have when people come over to watch the game.  Thanks Jessina!

Loved them... made them in phyllo tarts as written.  I think putting them in regular scoops tortilla chips would make this great appetizer just ordinary.  Just my opinion, try as written first!  Thanks for sharing!

We put this filling into wonton cups rather than phyllo tarts. Ours could've used more heat, but that varies on your jalapenos, and there's no way to really be sure til you taste it. Don't be tempted to overdo the jalapenos trying to make sure you get plenty of jalapeno flavor -- the cheese flavor is sufficient to make these fantastic even if your jalapenos are weaker than anticipated :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for family a couple weeks ago. Everyone loved them, and they were a breeze to make. I'll be making them again this weekend for snacks leading up to our family easter dinner. I've been using phyllo sheets though, since I can't seem to find the tart sheels anywhere. I double up the sheets per popper and hold them together while they bake with toothpicks!

This recipe is fabulous! I tripled the recipe and filled 45 phyllo cups, then used the rest of the filling for a mini (toaster oven-sized) pizza for a friend who eats a gluten free diet. The only modifications I made were adding about 1 t. garlic salt and using about 1 1/2 t. adobo sauce in addition to the hot sauce, because I only had 1 T. hot sauce. I will definitely make this every time I get a carry-in request. THANK YOU for sharing!

FANTASTIC!!!  I made them as stated except I put them in Tostada Scoops!  Recipe for 12 actually made about 30 with the Scoops.  Fantastic! I baked them a bit too long at 10 minutes so I will bake them for only 8 minutes next time. Not too too spicy.  They are more taste of heat then true heat.  Even my daughter had some!

This is a great recipe!  We really loved this just as written, though I like the suggestion of one of the other reveiwers and think I will add crab meat next time.  The other thing I have done is used wanton wrappers when I didn't have the phyllo cups and that worked equally as well. This is definitely a keeper!

I thought these were a fun idea for our superbowl potluck.  I put the filling in a baggie, snipped a corner and piped filling into scoops chips rather than phyllo cups.  Most people enjoyed these but thought the hot sauce made the filling taste more like hot wings rather than jalapeno poppers.

I have made this appetizer twice now and both times it was a hit! I would recommend trying to use jalapenos that are not crazy spicy otherwise you have a lot of mouths on fire! Because the main ingredient is the jalapenos, these can get a little spicy! Love the use of the phyllo shells and how quick and easy they are to make. They also can be prepped before-hand and stored in the frige if needed. Great quick app!

Keeper! Chopped up 4 jalapenos for this recipe instead of 2 called for by the recipe, as I really like it spicy! I also used real bacon (just a preference). Easy, perfect, and delicious!

Great recipe.  I took it to a superbowl party and everyone loved it.  Much easier, faster and so much less of a mess than maing regular poppers.  I used 2 more jalepenos than recomended and it was perfect for us.

I couldn't find phyllo tart shells where I live in Mexico, so I used potsticker wrappers and molded them down into the mini muffin pan. Worked great and tasted great! Also used Chihuahua cheese with a tiny bit of cheddar, instead of all cheddar. Turned out great! They were gone in minutes! Next time I make them, I'm going to make my own tortilla chip "scoops" and see how that turns out!

I used the crescent roll dough without the seams.  I just spread the ingredients on the dough square and rolled the dough.  Then sliced to make cute little pinwheels. Placed on cookie sheet face up.  Baked according to crescent roll dough directions.  Might try next with puff pastry.

2 peppers was just a tad too spicy for me, even without using the hot pepper sauce, but hubby thought them perfect. They disappeared quickly! I will make again, but a double batch, less peppers & no hot sauce in one batch for me & the recipe exactly as stated for the hot hubby! I did eat two...so they are yummy. Piping the mixture in using a corner-cut baggy was key in not breaking the mini cups. I baked them first for about 5 mins, piped the mix in, then baked again another 5 mins. They were good at room temp & not at all soggy.

Awesome.  Next time I'm blending in some fresh sausage though.  I upped the cheddar a bit and can easily double or more the hot sauce.  OH and you can put WAY more jalepeno in to get the flavor right.

These cook up so nice and taste fantastic. I did add a little parmesan cheese to the tops of some and these ones were a little bit better. I will make these again and again.

I made these for an appetizer for Thanksgiving and they were the first things to go.  These were so delicious and so much easier than making an actual popper.  I did skip the hot sauce because I didn't have any (even though I could have sworn I did), but I can't wait to try them with.  These will be on my regular rotation for appetizers, because they are that good.

I will definitely make these again.  They have a gret (not too hot) flavor and the bacon bits really bring it home.   Nice thing about these is that while they are fabulous served warm, they also stood up very well to being baked early in the day for an event late in the afternoon.

These are wonderful!  I made them with diced jalapeno in the jar and added a little minced garlic.  I let the mixture marinate together for the afternoon before usisng it to make the cups.

These were fabulous!  I actually liked the use of the phyllo tart shells in this recipe.  I used canned diced jalapenos and added 3 tablespoons worth into the mixture.   So good!  I also left off the bacon, I don't think these really need it, but i'm sure they would be just as tasty with.  Thanks!

Love this recepie! When serving adults I don't change a thing!
My kids don't like jalapeno so when I am cooking for them I substitute the jalapeno for chives, double the cheese and incorporate extra bacon along with a dallop of sour cream. Cheesy, creamy goodness!

Firstly, our local WalMart no longer carries the phyllo cups... so I used the frozen sheets of puffed pastry. I also doubled the recipe for 24 servings instead & it was a HUGE hit.  I baked the pastry first for about 7 min. then I spooned the mixture on top and baked another 10 min.  So good!

Amazing! I used Tostino's Scoops and put the mixture into a ziploc bag and cut a tip off to easily pipe into the scoops, otherwise it would have been difficult/messy to spoon in there. I also added S&P and used microwave bacon and turned out great!

Great!!!  The tart shells come in a 15 count package and the recipe makes them all.  I double the recipe, make two batches and freeze them.  Perfect for when company drops in.  So much healthier, too.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Perfectly Delicious!
Used Tostitos Scoops (not any other chip brand of "scoops" because they have round bottoms that won't sit upright on your baking sheet).
Used Diced Jalapenos in a jar (3 tablespoons DRAINED for average adult taste).  I think fresh jalapenos might be too crispy in this recipe.
Any hot sauce should be fine, but I used Tabasco since it was the only one labeled as "pepper sauce".
REAL bacon bits in the zipper pouches found near the salad dressing and croutons in the store (do not use "imitation" bacon bits...totally different product).
NOT good for potlucks or large parties where several dishes are set out buffet style.  These are not good cold or reheated as they will be chewy or scorched by a chaffing dish.  These are perfect for a few dinner guests served as an appetizer at a barbecue or to a hoard of teenagers as a snack.  Thank you Jessina!

These are fantastic prepared as written! I did leave out the bacon bits since I didn't have any and used sriracha for the hot sauce. Use the phyllo cups, they add a delicate crisp texture and fresh jalapeño so they don't taste pickled. My 23 year old nephew popped one in his mouth and said "these are amazing". They were demolished in minutes! Definitely recommend this recipe ??

Super easy!  I doubled the recipe and used 2 red and 2 green jalapenos since they were Christmas appetizers.  I combined the ingredients in a ziploc using reduced fat cream cheese and a blend of full fat and reduced fat cheddar.  I microwaved the bag about 15 seconds and snipped off the corner to pipe the filling into the cups.  I got side tracked and didn't bake them until an hour later and they turned out fine.  Will make again!

I love this recipe but if I want to make something for those people who arent a fan of spicy foods, I use chopped pimentos instead of jalapenos. Very good!

Delicious!  Big hit on Thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and I used Tostitos Scoops instead.  I went light on the jalapenos because I was afraid they'd be too spicy, but they ended up not spicy enough so I put a few drops of hot sauce on each one before serving.  Will definitely use the recommended amount next time.  Thanks!

These were delicious, although next time I will saute the jalapeno first as I don't like biting into crunchy jalapeno.  Big hit at the BBQ!  UPDATE - Sauteeing these is a MUST...these are gone within minutes...they are good in the phyllo dough cups, but they are also incredible in Tostitos Scoops...they might actually be better in the Scoops because they have a little salt added.  These are my new go-to apps, they are so delicious!

I've had better popper recipes...the phyllo cups gave them a crispness and the texture just didn't taste good to me with the filling.  The filling was good, but I would do something else with it, maybe bread and fry?? Not sure.  But the phyllo doesn't work for me.  Sorry.

Excellent recipe, and very easy to make. Like other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and used two packages of 15 phyllo shells. I avoided the hot sauce for the first batch, and it tasted great with "medium" heat. I used real bacon pieces instead of the "bacon bits" with excellent results.

These are now my go-to summer appetizer! I have tons of jalapenos in my garden and found this to be the tastiest way to use them. Have made it twice now exactly as the recipe states. Wouldn't change a thing. So easy too.

Love at first bite.  I baked in toaster/convection oven and that put my on top bacon a little too close to the heat. I mixed most of the bacon into the cheeses and will put it all inside next time, many more next times. The delicate brittle crisp of the phyllo contrasts so well with the creaminess  of the cheeses. I had a bit of filling left and used that as a spread for a turkey roll up.  If serving more than a few people you will want to make more than one batch, no one can eat just one of these.

They were great, I couldnt find mini phyllo cups, and I wanted to use whole grain phyllo so i just stuffed phyllo sheets into mini muffin pans and filled with the mixture and pushed down. They were delicious, made them for 3 different parties, they were gone quick

Used Pillsbury Crescent Roll Creations Sheet, reduced to 1 jalapeno, added canned crab, and forgot the bacon bits. This was delicious!! Crowd pleaser. Will make again!! Will try with both jalapenos and bacon bits next time - and of course the canned crab.

Excellent! I didn't have any bacon, but they were tastey anyway!  Brought them to a pot luck and didn't have ANY to take home.  I highly suggest doubling the recipe.  I had left over filling that I just popped in the oven and served with chips.

I made this for my husband's birthday and doubled the recipe because I had a total of 9 people . The doubled recipe filled 15 phyllo cups perfectly. This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! The only change was I used real bacon insted of bacon bits. My husband thought they were great and he is not too found of spicy foods. Definitely a keeper. You can easily prepare the filling a day in advance. I'll be serving these at gatherings for years to come!

I followed the helpful suggestions of others and these came out great. I doubled the recipe to make 30 poppers; our shells come in packages of 15 each. I used real bacon, two tablespoons of diced jalapeño from a jar, and made the mix a day ahead so it had time to get happy. I cut the corner off the ziplock bag and piped neatly into the phyllo shells. They took about 25 minutes to bake and were gone in 5 minutes.

I couldn't find individual cups so I used a sheet instead. Cut them with a biscuit cutter. I was unsure how they would turn out, but they were a hit! Definitely a keeper.

Can we talk about all the friends I made at the Nascar tailgate last weekend because of this recipe?! I doubled it. I made 30 phyllo cups with homemade bacon bits, fat free cream cheese, and some seeds from the jalapeños. I also did the piping from a bag trick to make it quicker and easier. I will make this again and again and again.

So simple to make, but, packs a flavor punch!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, substituted ground Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the bacon.  The sausage worked perfectly with the cream cheese and jalapenos and really kicked these tasty jalapeno cups up a notch. I used Cholula for the hot sauce.  If you can't find phyllo cups you can use regular phyllo and form to your mini muffin pan or even pie crust would be great.  I will definitely be making these again.

These are excellent appetizers.  It’s a perfect ratio of cream cheese to cheddar cheese and the phyllo shells work great with it – crispy and light.  I try to find occasions to make this and I’m running out now that football’s over  :-)

Absolutely wonderful.  I like this idea much better than a whole Jalapeno stuffed, believe me.  Second time we left the bacon off and enjoyed just as much with cheese topping.  Had to watch carefully and broil the last minute or two.  Careful is the operative word!!! Burn easily.

My guests thought they were great! When I'm by myself, I make the filling recipe and microwave it. It makes a great hot dip for corn chips!

I've made this both in the phyllo cups, and doubled it and served in a casserole as a dip - much preferred as a dip with Scoops, it went over much better that way.  I diced up bacon and added most of it in to the cream cheese mixture, reserving just a little bit for garnish to sprinkle over the top (used the already-cooked kind, 1/2 package when I made a single recipe in the phyllo cups, and a whole package when I doubled the recipe and put it in a casserole as a dip.)

This is a great recipe for people who not only have just a few peppers but also for those people who don't like too much heat. The crunch of the phyllo adds wonderful texture. This isn't my favorite popper recipe but it is a great one regardless!

This was really good and very easy! I've tried this in phyllo cups and scoop chips and the scoop chip are definitely the way to go!  Definitely use two seeded jalapeños, as the heat is largely reduced by the cream cheese.  The last time I made it I accidentally added 8oz of cream cheese and a little extra shredded cheese--it was a happy mistake!  Doubled the recipe without reducing the flavor. These are even great the day after!

This was a good quick snack. I used scoops instead cause that is all I had and they turned out great. I also sprinkled a little garlic salt in them mix. Will make again!!

The entire family loves these.  Have them when we want a nice snack or when we have guests for dinner.  We never change a thing besides roming the seeds sometimes in the jalapenos and sometimes not for some extra heat.

Super simple and gone in a flash.  Used 15 phyllo tarts, as that is how mine come packaged, and there was more than enough filling.  Great way to use up the last of the jalapenos from my garden that I still had in the freezer.  Used Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits (in the yellow bag) and they really worked well.  Definitely a keeper.

Yummo!  This was a great app to bring for a game night get together with friends.  I doubled the recipe & it made 30 mini phillo cups.  I used the frozen mini cups from the freezer section.  I also you fresh turkey bacon, but only put it on half of the apps.  On top of tasting good (& a bit spicey), it was a nice presentation.

This were really good. I didn't use bacon and forgot to add the hot sauce but they were still a make again appetizer. In fact the kids were probably happy that I forgot the hot sauce because they loved them. Definitely will make again, but I like the idea of using baked tortilla cups in place of the phyllo tarts (although I thought the tarts were quite good).

These were so delicious.
I used almost a whole tall jar of jalapeños instead of fresh...a box of cream cheese, 1 cup shredded cheddar  and two boxes of phyllo cups. (Plus dash of hot sauce and bacon bits on top of course)
Turned out great!
Next time I want to try everyones scoops corn chip idea! (Phyllo is expensive!)

I recently took this to a Superbowl party and it was a huge hit! So easy to make too. I had everything at home but the jalapenos and phyllo cups. FYI they are in the freezer section if anyone has a hard time finding them at the grocery store! 

Lastly, I had a lot of leftover filling because I doubled the recipe (..and some), so I used the rest to make stuffed chicken. SO GOOD.

This was an amazing recipe.  My husband really liked them.   Only issue is dealing with the phyllo.   Couldn't find phyllo tarts so cut small squares and used mini muffin tins.  Made 24 and makes great appetizers!

WOW! These were amazing. I did put my own spin on them and took advice of other reviewers.
I sauteed the chopped jalapenos, then added a couple of tblsp of pineapple jam. added the cream cheese, the cheddar and about a tbsp of  apple habanero bbq sauce. Added half a pound of chopped bacon and put all that in a ziplock bag and let it sit over night. The next day, I let it warm up some, and piped it into Scoops. Topped with the other half pound of chopped bacon, and cooked at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes.  So good, had lots of party goers come up to me and ask to share the recipe.  Will definitely make these again.

My now 11 year old son and I have been making these for your years as he loves the crunch of the phyllo tart shells.  Easy recipe to make with kids as well.  I usually leave out the hot pepper sauce since he his younger and it is something we do not miss in the recipe.

Tastes great. I liked it just as much in a Tostito Scoop as in the phillo cup. I agree with a a previous comment that the 2 jalapenos were needed.

These disappeared quickly! Delicious and easy. I didn't use bacon because I had vegetarian guests but I didn't feel like I missed out on anything.  Also used pickled jalapenos as our grocery store didn't have fresh. Definitely a hit with everyone.  Thank you!

These were delicious and they were a big hit at the super bowl party!  I doubled the recipe and it made 30 cups.  I followed the recipe, except I left out the hot sauce because I was afraid that it would be too hot.  I did also add a dash of garlic powder.  Everyone enjoyed them and I even got requests for the recipe!

12/20/18 - some changes per reviews, I used wonton wrappers instead of phyllo shells, added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup cheddar, these were delicious but a little spicy for my taste.  I did use 3-4 jarred jalapenos instead of fresh, might try fresh next time.  Flavor was good.

I used wantons for the cups. Did not use hot sauce and used about a cup of sour cream. Added some garlic, salt, and Tajin. Spray the pan to keep from sticking.

This rating is for the filling only (- the bacon bits).
I didn't have the phyllo cups, so I used some tortillas chips, the scoop kind, and some mushrooms. Also used only about half the jalapeno to make it kid  friendly. I baked the filled chips for 15 minutes and the mushrooms for 20 minutes. 
Both were good. The kids liked the chips ones better,  of course  !

I made it originally as posted, loved it. In future batches I omitted the hot sauce and added scallions.  I have been freezing batches as I harvest my jalapenos from the garden.  This will make great appetizers for the upcoming holiday celebrations. Thank you for an easy, great recipe that everyone loves.

Made double batch as directed in the phyllo dough cups (15 per package found in the freezer section at my grocery store) and they were a hit. Had enough with double batch to fill 2.5 boxes or make ~36-37. 12 minutes is all they baked and they went VERY fast.

I made these exactly as the recipe said. Delicious! The only thing I did different is when I took them out of the oven, I put them in a slow cooker without the lid on. They stayed hot and crispy! Many people asked for the recipe!

I have now made this 3 times!  I've doubled the recipe each time.   It's fantastic in phyllo cups, but also really good in tostitos scoops and tonight I'm making it in a pie plate as a dip.  When I doubled it I only used 3 jalapenos because they were bigger peppers.  I put the bacon on top so it wouldn't get soggy.  I brought them to a couple of parties and they disappeared quickly!  I would definitely recommend this.

These were great, and disappeared within minutes of coming out of the oven!  Next time I will double the recipe!  I used diced jalapenos from a jar.  I did 2 tbsp of jalapenos and 1 tbsp of juice.  I then skipped the hot sauce and left everything else the same.  They were great!

I used a little more cream cheese and only 1 jalapeno.  I used Tostitos scoops, and put the dish in the microwave to heat it up.  Delicious!

These were perfect!  I didn't have bacon bits so just omitted that step.  My only complaint is that this didn't make very many.  I used pasty puff sheet and pinched them up at the top.  The recipe only made 10.

Recipe needs more jalapeno and is too creamy, one or two is good, but then it is just too much.

I didn't like this recipe.  I didn't get any spice out of it and very little flavor.
