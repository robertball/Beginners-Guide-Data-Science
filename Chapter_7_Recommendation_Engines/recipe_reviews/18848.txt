This salad was delicious.  I did make a few changes:  used wild rice instead of white, add 1 tsp. curry powder and minced ginger to vinegar sauce for the salad.  At the time I made it, I only had red onions, so I minced 1/2 of one instead of using green onions, but I think either would be fine.
For the meat, I had roasted a whole turkey breast the night before & used 1/2 of it for the salad.  
Very, very tasty - indeed!

I made this for a local "iron chef" competition with the ingredient being coconut.  I didn't win but the dish is delicious none the less!
