It was easy and delicious. Even my husband liked it, and he's hard to please.

My family loved this recipe!  I used extra Classico sauce on top at the end and it was so tasty!

I think what made this dish for me was preparing my own polenta from scratch. It is a biut challenging to make your own, but well worth the taste of home made and not packaged, which tends to be bland and have a weird chewy texture. Plus, it is fun to watch your polenta firm up and have it be your own. Otherwise, great idea. I am going to try making my own pesto as well, since the jarred pesto does not have the flavor I am looking for.

This was OK.  The pine nuts really added the flavor.  The kids did not like the polenta at all though so I will probably not be making it again.

We LOVE this recipe! We make it in an 8x8 pan though so that it's thicker.  We serve it with grilled Italian bread with olive oil and rosemary and its a favorite combo. Highly recommended from my crew!

This was just okay for my family.  I won't make it again.  It had a lot of flavor but the polenta texture was just too much for my crew.

Deeeelish!
We used Trader Joe's Polenta (shaped like a 3-4" diameter sausage) and TJ's Marinara.  Made our homemade pesto (standard recipe) then threw in some raw mushrooms and spinach...Fantastic except that the veggies added so much moisture we ended up having to bake at 280 degrees for about 2.5 hours to get rid of moisture (grimace).   It ended up to be one of THE best things I've ever made casserole-style in terms of flavor.  It was still really soupy (so the presentation was not what it could have been) and I am not sure if that is the dish or my additions that turned it into such wetness...but it was definitely worth the spoon.  I think we probably also were more liberal with our Marina Sauce (we love sauces).  Polenta was gummy despite the long bake and the cheese and spinach (did 2 layers of the veggies, just like the polenta) was crunchy on top (Spray the spinach with oil when baking before the broil to keep it from charring).  Thanks Allrecipes for this one!!!  Alison
