Yes, these amounts ARE approximate!  In the marinade, the amounts of wine to oil should be equal--a quarter cup of each is fine.  The oil to the acid should be equal.  There shouldn't be NEAR that amount of wine for the sauce--more like a couple of tablespoons.  The base of the sauce shouldn't be wine, but instead chicken broth, water, or even apple juice.  The roll-ups themselves are very tasty--the brown sugar added great flavor.  To continue this flavor through the meal, I made it with mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar.

This was just ok.  I omitted the brown sugar.  I poured all but 3T of marinade over chicken when cooking and the sauce that it made while cooking and the sauce I made stove top (honey, mustard, wine) were completely different.  The two mixed ok...but the honey, mustard, wine sauce had a strange flavor.  This recipie needs some work before it is "perfected".

We loved this! The submitter is right, the measurements can be changed to suit. I used a 1/2 cup olive oil to 1 1/2 cup wine in the marinade. Fresh herbs are a must! Be sure to add the flour first to the sauce and let it brown to a roux, then add your liquids. Add them slowly and whisk to desired consistency. I probably added about 1 1/2 cups wine to the sauce  but did it slowly to let it blend and thicken. I simply slit the chicken breast and secured the cheese wrapped in ham inside. Also, don't leave off the brown sugar! I adds a nice hint of sweetness that balances with the sauce. Thank you! I would make this again!

This was great. I left out the sauce & sugar because I am on a low carb diet.  This did not change the great taste of the chicken.

Really good, but I'm confused about the number of servings. How is it that two chicken breasts are 8 servings? And each is 400
