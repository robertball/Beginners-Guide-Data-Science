This was ok, nothing special but nothing bad either.  Probably would not make again.

I used Kentucky Wonder beans and fresh tomatoes from the garden, 3 cups of chopped cherry tomatoes! This was delicious. It does take a long time to cook, compared with other vegetables (needs all the time the recipe says). I also added 1 teaspoon of salt because I thought it was really bland without it.

Yum. I like to consider myself something of a green bean expert because they are my favorite, and this recipe is excellent. I used frozen beans because I didn't have fresh. You can vary the cooking time depending on how well done you like your beans. Perfectly tomatoey! Thanks!

This was full of tomato flavor, and I normally wouldn't mind that, except I wanted to taste green beans.  If I make this again, I will add more green beans, I think, and a bit more garlic, since I could hardly taste it.

My husband and I liked it very much! The combination of garlic, tomatoes (I used fresh ones) and beans was so delicious. Definitly a keeper!

I tried this for the ease of it. It was ok, but I do a much better version and wont take the short cuts again.

This was great.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes with chilies - which added a nice heat to the dish.  I also replaced the pine nuts with black beans.  A new favorite.

Yum! I didn't have any pine nuts but I can only imagine that they would have added to this great recipe. I used frozen green beans because i din't have fresh. Very good. My toddler ate the tomatoes and asked for more.

Wonderful recipe! Lots of flavor. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and added a little extra olive oil and about 1/4 cup water.

This recipe is a good but it definitely needed some tweaking to get to that craving factor. I added a small fennel bulb to the recipe which I cut into thin strips and sautéed in extra olive oil with the garlic at the beginning. The dish needs more fat to balance the acid of the tomatoes and lemon juice. You can do this by adding a little butter (a tablespoon or two) or grated Parmesan cheese or both. I did this the first time and it greatly improved the dish.To be truly decadent cover everything in Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese and butter and bake in the oven until the topping is crisped up a bit. Some agave nectar or sugar could be added for sweetness if you aren’t counting calories.

This was very good. I particularly liked the lemon flavor. Didn't have any pine nuts and I had to use frozen rather than fresh green beans, but it turned out well regardless. I always appreciate a good, healthy, easy side dish that doesn't take much effort to prepare!

Used frozen green beans. With cooking so long, beans turned dark green & were soft. I prefer crisper, brighter green beans. But flavor was okay.

This is very good and refreshing.  I make this in the summertime when tomatoes are more prevalent.  My aunt-in-law has a giant veggie garden so I am always looking for new recipes for fresh veggies.

I substituted fresh roma tomatoes  for the canned and added an extra clove of garlic as well as about 2 tablespoons of flax seed.  The green beans maintained their color and crispness. This is a delicious recipe!!
