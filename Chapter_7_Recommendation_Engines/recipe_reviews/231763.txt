I am rating this with only 4 stars because I altered the original recipe a bit.  I doubled the broth and also added 1 thinly sliced carrot and 1 cup frozen peas.  It was tremendous.  Hearty and healthy.  I also used mushroom tortellini and great Northern beans because that was what I had on hand.  I absolutely loved this soup and it will be fun to try different ingredients with this soup.  I will definitely be making this a lot during the winter!

This had a lot of flavor.  I added some garlic granules.  I put everything in the crockpot at once and cooked on low for 4 hours.  Will make this again--it is so easy and so flavorful.

This is excellent healthy comfort food!  As we are not zucchini people I tore spinach leaves in the soup.
We also added another can of italian diced tomatoes so the tortellini was a little less dominate. Will be a keeper in our home:)

This was awesome!   We added hamburger as well as garlic and onions.   It was so tasty and perfect for a cold night.  I did add more broth and had black beans just because that is what I had on hand.  We will definitely have it again. It was extremely easy

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I sautéed the zucchini with fresh garlic and added sliced mushrooms before adding it to the soup. I also chopped up  whole peeled plum tomatoes instead of Italian diced and just added Italian herbs to the sautéed veggies. When it was almost done, I threw in some green onions. It was full of flavor and the whole family loved it.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I added corn and a little brown sugar.  My entire family loved it.  Even, I, who don't like spinach.  This recipe is a keeper.

Hey, this was great! Very easy too. I added some frozen kale, onion powder, oregano, and garlic powder and substituted the beans for green peas. The red wine vinaigrette just made this. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that was a snap to make on short notice after a walk on a 12-degree F night! Warmed us up right.

I like this recipe a lot.  I doubled the amount of chicken broth because I like more broth in my soup.  I also omitted the red wine vinaigrette because I had none on hand.  But it tasted good and was quick and easy to make.  Will definitely make again!
