I love this recipe.  I use chopped walnuts though and skip the celery, and sometimes just a touch of sourcream.  I get rave reviews every time!

I omitted the celery and pimento peppers and added marshmellows.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I will be making this again.

My mother used to make this recipe during Christmas.  The only different thing she did to it was substituted maraschino cherries in place of the pimento.  It's so yummy, that it's more like a dessert than a salad. :)

Very good.  My 11 year old daughter made this for me for Mother's Day!  She did a great job.  I would have left out the celery and added mandarin orange instead.  Everyone picked out the celery.  It was a bit bitter but we liked the crunch.

My grandmother made something very similar.  She used coolwhip instead of heavy cream and cottage cheese instead of cream cheese and drained pineapples as the fruit... fabulous

It is a very good recipe. What I did in the place of pimento and celery was used walnuts and i topped it with marshmallows which it is wonderful, depending on the occasion i change the flavor, but it is a wonderful treat to have

I made this for Easter. It was a big success, everyone loved it! The pimento gives it a very nice flavor! Seems an odd thing for a jello salad but it blends beautifully in a cold jello salad. I am making this again next week for a large party.

Wow, this takes me back to holidays at my grandparents house.  Every Thanksgiving & Christmas we had one of these (and it tastes even better than I remember) and also a strawberry cream jello dessert.  After searching several recipes, this one was the best by far.  Make sure to follow the 1 hour pre-chilling before putting in the other ingredients so they don't fall to the bottom... this is key!

I made this for a book club meeting. Everyone enjoyed it and I had no leftovers. It is very similar to a recipe my mother made every Thanksgiving. I will be adding jello salad to my holiday meals.
