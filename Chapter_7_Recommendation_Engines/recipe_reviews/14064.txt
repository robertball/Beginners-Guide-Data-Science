Good Recipe! Rather than the adding the onion & tomato, I use a couple of tablespoons of salsa.  I mash the salsa in with the avocado.  Add a teaspoon of sour cream at the end for a creamier texture.  The sour cream also helps it from turning that ugly green-brown the next day if you have leftovers.

I think a helpful hint for this recipe, or any avacado recipe, is that instead of peeling the avacado with a veggie peeler (it can be slippery and difficult, cut it in half length-wise and separate the halves. Then, take a knife and cut down through the inside down to the inside of the skin.  criss-cross the cuts to make little squares. You can then easily scrape the avacado chunks out or simply invert the skin so that the inside is pushed outwards. The pieces will just pop out! This works well if you want chunkier guacamole. Reserve some chunks and mash the rest.

This was a yummy recipe!!  I love guacamole and never thought I would be able to duplicate or better a popular Mexican restaurants recipe!  I added some chopped cilantro, green scallions, a splash of olive oil and a capful of white vinegar ( a trick from the restaurant) Delicious!!!

This is the ***BEST*** guacamole recipe! ==> After scouring all suggestions from other reviewers, here's what you can do to make people continue to beg for more: Use only the juice of 1/2 of a lime.  Add  chopped cilantro, green scallions, a splash of olive oil, a capful of white vinegar, Pace salsa and 1 tbsp sour cream (for creaminess).  I haven't bought guac from a store nor eaten it in a restaurant since I started making it this way!

This is "way too much onion for 2 avacados!" If adding the lime juice more than a squeeze will make this very tart to. I normally just mash the avacado, with a potato masher, and add a little salt, chopped tomato, cilantro, garlic, and just a tad of onion with a very light squeeze of lime. When I worked at a mexican restaurant that was how they made it to. The avacado taste should not be overwhelmed by the onion.

Great guacamole recipe! Guacamole is easy to make, and altough it's very simple it's always a matter of taste.  When a recipes states one small onion diced I use only 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped red onion for 2 avocados.  I de-seeded the tomato (used 1 roma) and added 1/4 tsp. of cumin and 2 cloves of minced garlic from a jar along with the rest of the ingredients. Always delicious served with warm tortilla chips!

Good recipe Denise. I absolutely love Guacamole.  This is definitley a good starting point.  I like to add a little Pace Picante to mine and mince the onions instead of chopping them. Lime is definitely a must! Sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I'll add some onion flakes or powder instead.  Some people say that "real" guacamole has either sour cream or cream cheese.  I've  never heard of that...but I might add some next time I make this, just to see how it tastes.  A word of advice...if you keep the avacado pit in the guacamole..it will help keep it from turning brown as fast.

Very good recipe, I dd however make a few slight modifications. Since we like it spicy I added 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced to the recipe. I also added onion powder, garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes and used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1. I also dice the onion instead of mincing to add a chunkier texture to the guacamole. It always turns out absolutely delicious!! I now make this recipe on a regular basis as it is often requested :)  Great on tacos, burritos, chicken breasts, hamburgers or to simply just dip with chips for snacking!

Once you start making your own guacamole you'll never buy it again!  I have made this many many times but with a couple of changes.  I only 1/2 a lime's juice, otherwise I find it too acidic.  I don't put in the tomato but I do add extra garlic (at least one extra clove) and a good sized handful of chopped fresh cilantro (makes a huge difference).  I also add a tablespoon of  sour cream for creaminess and a little drizzzle of olive oil to help preserve it.  Leftovers do not keep well but if you make sure your container is absolutely airtight you will get a couple of days before it turns brown.  Try this with Black Bean soup or your favorite Tortilla chips-YUM!

Hi :) we are South Korean students. This review is an assignment in English class.   I think that this recipe is so easy;   I'll make it again and again.  Rather than adding the onion & garlic. I would use a couple of tablespoons of salsa and more tomatoes.   I disagree with other people’s suggestion to add white vinegar and sour cream.     This is because, we don’t like sour taste.   I think that more salt and pepper would be good.  We have never seen a food like this. This is because there aren’t tropical fruits such as avocado in Korea.  When we ate it first, this taste was weird for us. But if you eat it with chips it is good.   Also, we recommend to eat it with beer.  I hope that our review will be helpful to you. Thanks for reading.

Very good and very chunky! Make sure your avacados are not too hard and not too soft. I usually have to wait 2 or 3 days after buying the avacados. If you can't easily mash the avacado meat with a fork then they are not ripe. Guacamole is one of those things I'm always tinkering with. There is always room for improvement to reach avocado nirvana! So, on the second or third time I made this, I used a can of drained, diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. Just make sure they are well drained otherwise the water will pool on the bottom of the dish in a few hours. You can't eat just one...bowl!

This is a great guacamole. A helpful tip: when storing in the fridge, keep covered in a non-clear dish, covered with foil or a solid color lid. The reason is the light from the fridge when you open the door causes a reaction and browns the guac faster. Mine lasts 4 days or so this way. Stays green.

Put the pit back into the finished Guac until you are ready to serve. Helps keep it from discoloring. I've been making this recipe for ever, and am well known for it.  Might have to make a batch right now. yum

I usually make guacamole without a recipe and this was by far the best one I've made. I used more garlic, less tomato, and added a little soymilk. I blended the avacado, onion, garlic, lime juice and soymilk in my magic bullet before adding the tomatoes. It was awesome!

I generally make my guacamole with several more add-ins, namely fresh cilantro or parsley, minced jalapeno pepper and cumin. (I also prefer lemon over lime juice)  However, I really wanted to try something different, with cleaner, simpler flavors, particularly as I planned to use it as a condiment for a main dish rather than as a dip with tortilla chips.  This MIGHT have been it had it not been for an overload of both lime juice and onion.  I cut both back by half and, while the lime juice now seemed to be just the right amount, the onion still was dominant.  Wish I could take some back out!

This was (past tense because I've nearly ate it all already) AMAZING.  Best guacamole ever.  Taste very authentic.  I added sour cream and substituted salsa for the tomatoes.  A win!

This recipe was good. My husband is mexican and alot of my friends. Non of them had ever heard of adding cream cheese or sour cream so i didn't. I also only added half a fresh squeezed lime and even that was a bit much. (my lime half had a lot of juice) I used 2 tomatoes because my husband loves them, 2 gloves of garlic, 2 finely chopped jalapenos, 1 small onion and a tiny slice of ginger. The recipe provided is a great starter recipe.

All I can say is, "Wow!"  The family thought I was the best mom ever for making the best guac ever.  And nothing was so simple to make.  I'd definitely serve this again, and would proudly serve it to guests.

Yum! Simple and delicious! I made this to have on its own and to out in a seven layer dip for a party... it was great both ways! I doubled the recipe and added a little garlic salt and a dollop of sour cream which helped the consistency a lot. Great recipe.

Really great. My only dislike was it had too many onions on it. I think next time I will use a food processor to really cut up the onion smaller and maybe only use 1/3 or less of the onion.

I've been using this recipe for about 5 years, and everyone loves it. One can be quite flexible with the amounts of everything. Sometimes, to make a bigger dish of it, I add sour cream -- not true guac then, but people still love it.

This is the most delish guacamole I have ever had, and is very simple to make.  I took another reviews advise and added cilantro, sour cream, salsa.  This is a keeper.

got rave reviews from this: I had a guest who's been to Chile for a while and he told me that mine is better by a long shot.
It kept really well, thanks to the avocado stone I left into the dip, perharps? I had a very heavy hand with the onion, really, and I think I'm going to go easier next time, but nobody ever complained about it!

SOOO good, and yes, was SO easy!  I only give it four stars because I added some dried cilantro to my guac, and I think that's essential in a good guac recipe!

But this is a good starter recipe for guacamole.

This is the same recipe I've been using for years. I have a very hard time eating store-bought guac now. So easy and yummy, and takes 5 minutes to make! :)

Delicious! I added garlic and would have added fresh cilantro if I had any because I always think that takes guacamole up to the next level. Great tip for anyone using avocado - if you leave the pit in the container with the guacamole, it doesn't turn brown. Really!!!!

Excellent! I do not really care for guacamole, but had some ripe avocados laying around.  This recipe was simple and yummy.  I didn't have a tomato, so I used a few dollops of canned crushed tomatoes...worked just fine ;-)

Oh man is that good!! I did make a few changes, I used my food processer~ so much faster~ I also added about a half a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis (well drained) and a couple of tablespoons of sour cream as suggested, and only half the lime juice. I only used half a small onion and added a bit more garlic. After blending in the food processer I added another couple of spoonfuls of the tomatoes to add a little chunkiness. It came out SO good, I could eat it by the spoonful!!!!

Yep, it's easy! If I'm in a rush or feeling particularly lazy, I'll leave out the onion and garlic. I'll use grape tomatoes a lot, too -- I just chop them in half or quarter them, depending on size. Oh, and I always add cilantro; I don't measure it, but it's more than a pinch and less than a full tablespoon.

This recipe is VERY close to the one I've made most of life. I usually leave out onions for personal preference and will use garlic salt for convenience (I like mine with just a bit of salt). But, here's a hint that I figured out about 20 years ago. I don't even remember where I read it, but, it REALLY works. Save 1-3 of the pits from your avocado and simply place them on the top of the dip before putting it into the fridge. It just won't turn brown. And, it works better than anything I've EVER tried for keeping the brown from forming. (including the sour cream, mayonaise, lemon juice---yes, I've tried them all. I've even been able to eat it 2-3 days later with this method.

If u mix in a tsp or 2 of mayo it won't change the flavor and the preservatives in the mayo will keep it from turning brown so fast.

This needed a little tweaking. I added a hot pepper sauce ( chile Habanero) and cilantro. No garlic, a bit too much, and for excellent flavor or a spicy kick add chopped peppers. My manager hates guacamole and now pays me to make his own personal bowls.

Simple, quick, easy, delicious! Made it as stated first, loved it, and then added a bit of chopped up pickled jalapenos and loved it even more. But it definitely is a five star standing on its own as well. Yum!

Great recipe. This easy has been in the family cookbooks for almost 50 years. To get the most flavor from the aditions finely chop the onion and tomato. We do not put Lime or Lemon in as it is gone in a very short time and we do not to lengthen the guacamole life.

My next contribution will be Chili Ancho Tamales.

Very simple, very easy to make.  I only had one avocado, so kind of winged it.  Added some chili powder for a bit of a kick.  It was a spontaneous thing, so I didn't have lime - went with lemon...wish I had a lime.  Will have to make this again.

Great, simple recipe for delicious guacamole. I, too, added a jalapeno to the recipe, as well as a few dashes of Red Hot, for some extra kick. I made this to use on lime shrimp quesadillas, but it's equally tasty as a snack alone with some tortilla chips.

This was great. I used minced garlic from a jar and more lime juice than was called for, and it turned out awesome and there's none left over.

This is nice and simple, with few ingredients. I subbed cilantro for the onion and lemon juice for the lime juice. Guacamole is always a great snack!!!

Great Recipe !  Although the first time I made it I skipped the garlic and substituted it with Cilantro and used a Lemon instead of a Lime - only because I already had those  It came out so Delicious !   The second time around I did the Garlic & the lime but added a little Olive Oil from a suggestion from my Husband and it came out really good as well - I couldn't tell that much difference except with the Garlic which made it even more YUMMY  I just LOVE Guacamole and NOW I can have it whenever I want - I LOVE how easy this recipe is - definitely a KEEPER

Great for Guac lovers! Very similar to the Best Guacamole recipe on this site, but this one uses lime instead of lemon, adds tomato and garlic which I like. If you like guac, you won't be disappointed. If avacados are in season and you want to try it out, go for it! Update: Found that I could replace the onion, garlic and tomato with 3 tablespoons of whatever salsa I have in the fridge (more or less for personal taste). Don't forget the lime is still needed. I skip the salt, but still like to add a little pepper.

Raw and fresh are definitely best! I use one key lime (small) and add some fresh cilantro. Then I use fresh carrot sticks, jicama, and celery to dip! More nutritious and better to the tummy. Yummm!

Guacamole has always seemed like one of those mysterious dishes that I would never be able to prepare at home.  Wrong-O!  This recipe made me feel like a pro and was actually better than most guacamole recipes I've had in restaurants.  It's versatile, easy to do, and unbelievably tasty.  Bravo!

A easy and delicious recipe for guacamole.   I usually add chile pepper but may add cilantro also next time.  This is great as a dip for tortilla chips and as the dressing for "Baja Bean Salad".

Haven't tried it with the onion in it yet, and we always have lemons on hand, not lime, but still it's very good!  Added some cilanto and fresh jalepeno peppers for more flavor. 5 stars

This guacamole is soooooo good!!  I added 2 tbsp. cilantro and it turned out perfect.  Never got around to chilling it because it was gobbled up too quickly.  Will make again and again.  Thanks.

Made Guacamole for the first time using this recipe. It was so good that we didn't even chill it we just ate it straight from the bowl. The surprise was after staying in the fridge overnight it was even better the next day. I would put this up against any Mexican Restaraunt's so called "fresh" Guacamole dips. It's just that good. For a twist add a little tobasco.

This recipe is so simple, and you can customize your guacamole to match your style. I used 3 avacados and 2 cloves of garlic. I am not much of an onion lover, so I only used half of one. Here's a tip. When you juice your lime, use the zest of it to give it a nice flavor. Once all your ingredients are combined, serve it up with some chips. (Sometimes I just eat it from a spoon!) I hope everyone can enjoy this recipe. Happy Dipping!!!!

Love it!  Easy to make & quick. To add a little kick, I substitute cayenne pepper for black pepper.  Used 3 avocados & 3-4 fresh minced garlic cloves.  If you like it spicy!

This is the best recipe.  I made a few changes however.  I added a tbs of fish sauce and a 1/2 chopped mandarin orange. I garnished it with a bit of cinnamon and shaved chocolate.  Yummy!

I can't get enough of this! I buy avocados every time I grocery shop now just to make this guac. It's so fresh, so tasty, and healthy! I have a tough time not eating it all! I don't add anything else to this because I like the simplicity.

This was fast and great. The only thing I did differently was add a little fresh cilantro. Rather than tortilla chips, I served it with Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps which was a tasty twist.

Good guacamole...I used salsa in place of the onion and tomato.  Maybe my avocados were overly ripe because the guacamole seemed to immediately turn brown.

Only thing I added was a little pickled jalapeno juice, and only because the can was already open on the counter.  It gave it a little extra zing!  But it was fabulous before I put it in--thanks much for the recipe!

Excellent taste and very easy. The texture was a bit grainy, however, so next time I will try mashing the avocado with the back of a spoon rather than the fork that I used this time.

This was good but I prefer Best Guacamole from this site just a little bit better.  Not sure if it is because the other recipe has olive oil added to it but this was worth making also.  Thanks

My first time making guacamole. It was an good entry-level recipe, but it left a lot to be desired. I did add sour cream, used a teaspoon of cilantro, a LOT more lime, and blended everything in a food processor, but the taste was still so-so. Something was missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it. My search for the perfect guacamole recipe will continue!

My sister gave me a recipe just like this and I love it. It isn't the same as in restaurants but it's fine by me. I add cilantro and use lemon juice instead of lime juice. I made it today with 3 avocados and 1 roma tomato. Also, to make it last longer, put the avocado pits in with the guacamole. It helps it to not turn brown so quickly. Even when just using half an avocado, put the pit back into the other half that isn't being used. It will keep it from turning brown. I have made this a few times and will continue to make it in the future.

Easy to make.  Be careful not to use too much lime juice.  I used bottled lime juice and I added too much- 3 tablespoons.  I should have used 2.  Otherwise it was great!  Next time I'll try adding sour cream for variety.

Very flavorful guacamole. I cut up the tomato very very fine and added 2T sour cream for a creamier texture. Thanks Denise. This was very yummy.

Good, but seemed to be missing something.  Perhaps a little sour cream to thicken it and some hot sauce or jalapeno to give it a little kick.  Very easy to make and will try again.

I have a bit of aversion to green slimy foods, and so I'm fairly new to guacamole. But we're trying to add some healthy fats to our diets, this was simple, so it was the first version I ever tried. It's delicious! I don't normally have tomatoes on hand since I don't care for them on their own, so I use a bit of salsa in its place, and add a bit of chipotle powder since I like that warm smoky flavour. We use this to dip crackers or chips in, or as a sandwich spread.

I replaced the lime with 1-2 tablespoons on lemon juice (2 T = very lemony, if you like that) and 2 tablespoons of salsa for the tomato.  I also used 1 tablespoon of dehydrated onion to control the onion strength a bit better.  Fantastic!

If you want a little kick- try adding SERRANO peppers for spiciness. Cilantro is a must and kosher salt instead of regular salt. I used to work at a Mexican restaurant where we had to make tableside guacamole :-)

Good!  Add a heaping tablespoon of sour cream; a small can of green chiles and a few shakes of tabasco and you might like it even more.

Fabulous!  Love this for both taste and ease of prep.  I added 1 can of green chili peppers or a half of a jalapeno (de-seeded and with white membrane removed) chopped fine, because we like it spicy, but for guests, I leave it out.

My husband declared he didn't like guacamole, then  he tasted this.  He LOVES it!  We like ours chunky, so I chop the onion instead of mincing it.  We love garlic, so I use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1.

This is my basic recipe.  I do not use garlic as it takes from the avacado.  I do, however use jalapenos to taste, chopped fine.  OR, you can use just a little jalapeno juice if you are serving younger children.  Leave out the garlic and you'll have a great recipe.

Fantastic! Have used this for years, cilantro for me, but exactly as written for my husband. Here is a "tool tip" for avocado receipies. Cut the avocado in half, around the pit. Hold the half that contains the pit in one hand, and "chop" your knife to the pit (kind of like a hi-ya motion) with your knife now "stuck" in the pit, just give a gentle turn and the pit will release easily from the avocado. Run your knife through the avocado one way and then the opposite, and use a spoon to run between the skin and fruit to scoop out perfect chunks! Very quick, very easy!

This guacamole tasted great! I don't like the crunch of onion in my guacamole so I substituted some onion powder. I also used 1 Tb of lemon juice instead of lime since that's what I had on hand.

The recipe seems bland and after reading the recipes I agreed. I halved the amount of onion, used 3 avocados, a little sour cream and added cilantro> The cilantro gave it the flavor it needed and added a nice little kick!

Awesome guac!  Made it for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was gone in a flash.  I used a little less lime, used a red onion (a little more than what was called for), and home made pico de gallo instead of tomatoes.  It was incredible.

Great and simple recipe!  I think I will add a little extra garlic and jalapenos next time for an extra kick!  Great for movie nights!

Very simple recipe but it needs more spices to deserve 5 stars. I added fresh cilantro, ground cumin and half a yellow jalapeño.

Thanks for a delicious recipe, my 4 year old and 18 month old ate it with spoons, didn't even need chips it was so good!  I used the recommendations to add vinegar, sour cream, salsa and cilantro.  I also saved 1/2 an avocado and just chopped it for a chunkier texture, delicious!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have a lime on hand so I used lemon....It was great! I also didn't have a masher, so I used a fork to mash the avacado. The onion and garlic gave it just the right amount of kick. I cut the recipe in half and used about 1/4 cup of onion, and I actually mashed the onion and the avacado together a little before adding everything else. This was a real treat compared to restaurant guacamole (which is usually made from powder). I used all organic ingredients, as usual, and this guacamole really made my nachos taste great! So delicious! Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This was so easy and fast!  It did taste best after it sat in the refrigerator for an hour or so.  It is great on tortilla chips and with carne asada!  I'll definitly make it again.

This was just ok, I would suggest not to add the entire juice of the lime. It was a bit much. It did not have the punch I expected. Will alter it a bit next time.  Thanks!

I used minced yellow onion instead of white onion which has a little more "bite". Also added cilantro. Lime juice does perk up the flavors.

Wonderful! This has a great taste without the added fat of mayo or sour cream. I made this for vegitarian night at our house. We heated some corn tortillas in olive oil then put shredded cheedar cheese, gaucamole, sour cream, black olives, and hot sauce for the adults. This is a great full-proof recipe that can be adjusted to suit your own tastes. THANKS!

This was really really good. It didn't last at all even though I doubled the recipe. We were all full and could barely eat dinner. I added cilantro and hot peppers to give it a little twist and got a lot of compliments. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for submitting.

Excellent recipe!  I've stopped buying guacamole at the store since finding this recipe -- this tastes so much better!  Remember to leave in one avocado pit to prevent browning.

My guests really liked it and were trying to guess what made the avocado so good! Simple ingredients but great taste. I substituted onions with minced shallots (commonly available in Asia) and use lemon juice which was at hand. VERY VERY quick to do.

Absolutely stupendous.  Just remember to read the directions completely, especially if you don't enjoy a limey taste.  I never thought I could make a decent Guacamole.  Thank you very much for this recipe.

Depending on what you prefer, you may want to add less onion and less lime/lemon (I find that either lime or lemon tastes great). And if you like a bit of kick, add a pinch of Cayenne pepper.   Other than those little adjustments, this is a pretty solid recipe that would please most!

I never knew guacamole was so easy to make. I followed the recipe as written.   Definitely way, way too much onion.  I'm almost think onion powder would be a better choice, but that's for next time's effort.  Otherwise  I'm a homemade guacamole convert.

Very fast, very easy to make!!  I added some lemon juice as well to help with the coloring so it's not so brown. I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt.

I was looking for a quick and simple recipe to use up an Avocado that had been forgotten about. This was perfect right up until I realize it assumes all fresh ingredients. I am not a pro chef, so I do not just know how to convert fresh to bottled ingredients. It would be awesome if you had at least measurements for all the add-in ingredients if one is forced to use, onion powder, garlic powder, bottled lime juice, etc....

I made it without the onion as I had none, and I doubled up on the garlic to compensate. Wow!

Last night I realized I did not have enough guacamole so of course ran to AllRecipes for some help. I came across this recipe and had everything on hand. I did everything but add tomatoes and it was awesome! Not only was it very easy but much better than store brought which I will never buy again.

I cut down on the onion and instead of diced tomato I drained a can of Rotel with green chilies.  It was "gone" in no time.

There was way too much lime juice for just two avocados.  The recipe was fair, but less lime juice would have definitely been a plus.

It blows my mind how many guacamole recipes have 20+ ingredients.  This recipe is simple and perfect.  I followed it exactly and I wouldn't change a thing!  I'm and American living in Berlin, and Germans aren't very familiar with Mexican cuisine.  I made this for a party and I got tons of compliments (and recipe requests) for my "Avocado Dip".  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have never made guacamole in my life before and this was great!  I followed a few hints from other reviewers, using salsa in place of onions and tomatoes and jarred minced garlic.  And I threw in some fresh cilantro.  I also put about a tablespoon of sour cream in at the end. Had to run back to the store to pick up some limes, but it was worth the trip, this was as good as I have had in Mexico!  Made it this afternoon and had it with nacho chips and chicken wings for a quick dinner.  ( I omitted the salt as on a sodium reduced diet, but it still tasted great)

This came out great. I did leave out the onion. My three year old extremely picky eater actually liked this! and she is very anti-green foods. She calls this wack-a-moleee and says it's super good.

I am a korean student and made the dish because of assignment. It was my first time making Guacamole I loved it.  If some people at the party didn't like avovados, so I suggest some changes to make the dish better for someone who dosen't like them. It will be better if you add nuts like almond and more chopped tomatos. If you like fruit, add ftuits like apples, oranges and something like that.

We loved this. I used onion powder instead of fresh onion and lime juice from a bottle. This got eaten immediately and was a hit. I tossed in some dried cilantro after tasting it and a splash of cayenne pepper sauce too.

Absolutely fantastic.  I did add just a bit of cilantro and it was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

I have been trying to make guacamole for years and finally this recipe made it happen. One secret, I put the chopped tomato in a salad spinner to get rid of all of the liquid and that helped a lot so that the guacamole isn't too watery. This is delicious!  Really yummy!

Good recipe, but I added a few ingredients after trying it "as is" first. First, 1 chopped, seeded jalapeno. Second, I use red onion instead of white. Third, add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, more chopped garlic and more lime juice as needed (I use the squeeze bottle of RealLime). I also add a splash of Crystal hot sauce, but that is personal preference 'cause I like the heat! After these additions, it was 5 stars!

Fantastic! I used green onion because I had it on hand, and I tripled the garlic because I'm a garlic fiend (although, it tastes delicious with just the recommended amount!). I will definitely be making this again.

Yum!  This was great!  If this is your first time using avocado, be aware that they should be slightly mushy when ripe.  I did't know that at first and bought hard avocados which I was not able to mash up!  The second time though, it was tasty!  I will make this again.

To avoid peeling, just cut the avocado in half, take your knife and whack the pit, the pit should stick to the knife and you can pull it out, then scoop avocado out of the peel using a spoon!

I was asked to bring guacamole to a party.  I personally don't like the taste of avacados, and I made this recipe exactly, since I didn't know what would taste good.  So many people complimented on this, many of them love guacamole and were asking for this recipe

I used al the ingredients shown above. Instead of the garlic, I used powder and the sour cream and the jalapenos give in a greater taste then the original bland taste. Also the oil and vinegar help adding flavor. I heated my guacamole so I mixed nicely then let it cool for 30 min in the refrigerator. This guacamole turned out great and tasty I highly recommend it. It also goes great with tortilla chips that are put in an oven for slightly less then 1 min so the chip are crisp, warm and tender. Also experimenting with different types of ingredients makes it taste better if in right amount.
4-5 stars

Really good basic guacamole recipe!  Just the right amounts of everything.  I minced the onion in my mini chopper, and it blended nicely.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  The first time I made it I squeezed the recommended 1 whole lime, but the taste of lime was overpowering.  The second time I used just one half of a lime and it was perfect.  This guacamole tastes just like it would at a restauraunt!

This has become a house favorite!  Dh isn't keen on avocados but I could eat them by the truck load!  And it's not *really* guacamole unless it has tomato in it!!!  We altered it a bit but it is just devine!  We added onion flakes instead of an onion; added fresh minced garlic that you can buy in jars and added a fair more than that equal to a clove; used 2 whole peeled canned tomatoes and chopped them; used juice from half a lemon (instead of lime); pepped up with some cayene pepper and a bit of chile.  YUMMY!!!!

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe for guacamole saved the day!  I thought there was some of that guacamole mix stuff left, but there wasn't and the grocery store by my house didn't have it.  I rushed here to find a guacamole recipe, and I found this one.  Thank goodness!  It tasted sooo good!  I omitted tomatoes though because my mom's a bit picky with her guacamole.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!

This is really good, but the more I make it, the more I change. I use the lime juice in the little container, and just a sqeeze or two. I also add a few cloves are garlic and use spicy Rotel canned tomatoes. Excellent recipe just the way it is though. Thanks!

This recipe is will do if you're in a hurry, or don't have more than the simple ingredients at hand, but if you're going out to buy avocados, go ahead and buy a little bunch of cilantro--it gives it a wonderfully fresh flavour.  A little too much lime for me in this one--slightly overpowering.  I definitely prefer the guacamole by Bob Cody.

Yummity yum yum!!!  I love, love, LOVE avocados, and guacamole is one of the best ways to use them.  This was a very easy recipe (I used a bit less onion and tomato than called for, because I didn't want either to overpower the delicious-ness of the avocados).  I was polite and gave a little bit to the guys for their fajitas (1T each, Ha!!), but the rest was alllll mine!

Fabulous, especially with the sour cream.  Maybe I'll add some black olives next time.  Unfortunately, avacados are a little pricey, otherwise I'd make this all the time!

WOW! Bought Avocados about 1wk prior, put in paper bag to ripen. All you need to do is invert skin.  This makes is VERY easy to mash.

I substituted LEMON for lime juice.  SUPER easy and GREAT tasting .. The left overs are great on sandwiches.

This was good.  I added a bit more lime, and a bit less onion and tomato.

A great quick Guacamole!  This was very quick and easy! I also had no idea the lime juice would keep the avocado from turning brown! I added a little dash of Garlic Power and Cilantro to it and it tasted great!

Once I modified the ingredient amounts, this was the perfect guacamole for us. I use 1/4 to 1/2 of an onion (instead of a whole one) and 1/2 a lime's worth of juice. Salt liberally; avocadoes love salt!

It’s decent but it was a bit bland for me, second batch I added some jalapeños to give it a small kick.

My first attempt at quac (my brother has been making it for years, swears his is the best).  We both took a batch to the Super Bowl party, mine was gone rather quickly, he took some of his home!  Sibling rivalry at its best.

Best Guac ever.  I had never made guacamole before and I needed the basics.  This was perfect.  I did leave out the garlic and the whole thing tasted super fresh.  Topped my best nachos ever.

First time making guac, and it was a hit!!!  looked for a recipe without cilantro (BIL HATES IT) You either love it or hate it I hear.  Will be making this again and again.  Will add jalapenos &  cilantro when he isn't around??. Thank you so much for a great dish.  Always use fresh ingredients!!!

Overall great combo and flavor. Too much lime juice and onion. I used about 1/4 red onion and should have lightly used 1/2 lime vs a whole. I added a little cilantro but will bring that down a bit too. Might take a few times to make it where it suits my taste buds.

A little too much onion and maybe a tad too much lime juice. I would make this again but I would cut the onion in half and maybe a smidgeon less lime. My lime did have a lot of juice in it. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was not bad. I do prefer a chunky guacamole but depending upon the ripeness of the avocado you could make a smooth or chunky texture.

I used one small onion and it overpowered the entire recipe. I added a third avocado in an attempt to resurrect the guac,  to no avail.

It was good but I made some modifications. The recipe calls for too much lime and a bit too much onion. I made it with 2 avocados and half a lime (instead of the 1 lime the recipe calls for) and it was still too sour. I ended up adding a 3rd avocado and some garlic salt into the mix. I used about 1/4 of a large onion, which is likely about 1/2 to 3/4 of the small onion the recipe calls for, since last time I made it I was told there was too much onion. I also used cherry tomatoes, estimating how many a large tomato would be. Overall it was pretty good.

Perfect guacamole! The only change I made was to use 2 shallots instead of the onion. It reduces the amount of onion, plus shallots are a little milder.

We love guacamole in our house so I chose this based on the ratings. This is way too much lime juice for the amount of avocado, and the avocados I used were quite large. I usually go by taste after putting in a little...should have done that with this instead of tossing it in...and I didn't even use the full amount called for. After there was so much lime juice, I kept trying to add other things to tone it down (onion, salt, tomato, sadly I had used all of both avocados!), and after all that stirring, it was way too creamy for our tastes. (My fault, not the recipe).

I left out the onion, and it was DELICIOUS. The lime juice really brings it all together. Serve this dish immediately, as it does brown quite fast.

Followed the recipe exactly and tried it. I love it as is! My boyfriend on the other hand wanted an additional lime! Then, he was happy with the recipe! I wouldn't change a thing and he would just add an extra lime! All in all, GREAT RECIPE!

Good base recipe to start with; I especially like the addition of the garlic.  I've made this recipe several times and always adjust it the same way.  Everyone asks me to bring it at get togethers and this recipe amount will serve two in my group!  I use about a half of a red onion (I love onion, but one whole one is way too much.  The red onion is a little sweeter than others.).  I add some fresh cilantro to taste.  A nice firm Roma tomato works best, but I'll use another type if that's what I have on hand and will simply omit the slimy inner segments.  Use a good tomato that is fresh to get the flavor benefit.  I often use a second lime, just depends on flavor.  Since my lime tree is pretty frozen, I used the mini cubes of juice that I'd frozen a month ago.  Even my picky son, who doesn't care for avocado or tomato, wolfs this down.

simple, easy, delicious.  after you core your avocados, slice each 1/2 in 1/2 and you can easily pull the skin right off

This is a delicious and easy recipe. Put plastic wrap along the guacamole and then a lid or second piece along the top of the bowl to keep it from turning black.If you know how to choose a ripe avocado you are all set!

This was a very simple recipe for my son, 13, to follow. The only thing missing was a little jalapeno, which I forgot to buy, so we added chili powder.

It was, indeed, easy, but not great tasting. I used about 2/3 of my lime juice and it was way too much! I like my guac to still taste like avocado and this didn't.

Wow! My first guacamole ever and it was great!  I have never found a store bought guac that I liked and was determined to find an EASY recipe to try at home. First one was a charm! Looking no further! Probably will ease up on the onion and add a tad more garlic per my anti-onion husband, but I thought it was perfect.  Thank you!

The one and only guac recipe I'll ever use.  It's seriously dead simple.  If I'm pressed for time, instead of chopping a small onion, I just use dried onion flakes, which rehydrate while the dip is chilling in the fridge.  So easy, so fresh, so good!  :)

A very traditional guac recipie.  I  use garlic salt for a more consistant flavor.  The lime juice will keep the guac from getting brown.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would.  It is the best guacamole ever.  I make if for my fiancé at least once a week for lunch or snack and he can't stop raving.  Really good large avocados work best, and I use the small plum tomatoes.  Also, I skip the garlic because there is such a little that it is hardly noticable.  Perfect!!!!  Try it once and you will be hooked.

My guests enjoyed it. At first it was difficult to find avocados that weren't hard so I had to go to another grocery store. I used half a large onion. I chopped it and most of the tomato in the food processor. The rest of the tomato I hand cut so it was chunky. Keep the avocado pits in the guacamole when you store in the refridgerator to keep it from turning brown. I liked that this recipe didn't have sour cream or cream cheese because my husband is lactose intolerant.

Everyone loves this guacamole!  It is so simple, nothing too fancy ... just perfect the way it is.  

But I do have to say that the last time I made it my avocados were slightly less ripe than they should have been and I was having a difficult time mashing them so I blended them with a couple of table spoons of cream cheese to help bind everything together and my guests all raved.  I may be adding cream cheese from now on since my husband thought it was the best guacamole he ever had.

OUTSTANDING! My husband thinks this is the best - better than at a restaurant!  I've been using this recipe for several months now.  I only use about 3/4 of a lime, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.

Made enough for two. Used only one avocado - wasn't enough - had to add sour cream into the recipe. Overall, a very satisfying nacho dip. Would suggest leaving in fridge 12-24 hrs to really mix up the flavors.

Too much onion! I only used two thin slices of a large onion, but that was too much for us! Next time, I'll cut back. Granted, the onion taste mellowed the next day, but if you're eating it soon after making, you might want to try with a smaller amount of onion (unless you're an onion fiend!) to begin with. I added two small tomatoes, with the juice from dicing, and I started by only adding half the lime, juiced. It needed more lime so I added the rest after mashing everything (except the tomatoes) well in a bowl. If you mash the avocados and then mash in the onion, garlic, lime juice, and salt and pepper, the flavors end up that much stronger and well-blended. But don't mash in the tomatoes unless you like it that way.. Personally, I prefer chunks of tomatoes. Thanks, Denise, it was really good. :)

I was never a guacamole fan until I started making my own.  This is awesome recipe!  I did add a chopped jalapeno, and used chopped green onions and left the mashed avocado a little chunky.  Took it to a BBQ, and everybody wanted the recipe.

I didn't have the tomato, so I simply put in 3 tablespoons of salsa instead. I also thought it wasn't tangy enough, so I added a couple of sliced jalapeno peppers. This is a great recipe, and a keeper.

This is awesome!  I didn't have any fresh limes, so I used 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of bottled lime juice, which worked just fine.  The bowl was empty by the end of the night!

Absolutely perfect guacamole!  I used a little less onion..just what I had on hand and added a dash of cayenne.  Husband raved about it and he's not a raver usually.  Will make again often.

I've never bought an avocado, let alone made guacamole as I'm not much of a guacamole fan. It must be because I've never had guacamole this way! This was excellent. I halved the recipe and used about 1/4 c salsa instead of the tomato since I didn't have one on hand. I also added 1 tsp of olive oil and used my food processor to blend it together. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent!  The flavors are fresh and simple, but not bland.  I mashed one avocado and chopped the other to give a chunkier texture.  A big hit at my potluck--will definitely make again and again.

This recipe turned out to be green flavored onion dip for us!  Then it turned into iron chef as we started just throwing things in to try and tame the onion flavor.  I thought I was using a "small" onion, but I guess not.  Could be a good recipe.

Yum!  The best guacamole I've ever had.  I just mash the avacados with a fork and then stir with other ingredients and it has such a wonderful texture.  I do add more garlic.  My family can't get enough.

I make similar guacamole, but with 3 avacados, about 1 tsp. garlic salt instead of a clove, and I add less than a 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro.  Sometimes I add a dollup of no fat sour cream if the avacados arn't ripe enough.  This is low fat and yummie :)

very good, easy, basic recipe that worked well in my food processor.  the garlic overpowered the avocado, so luckily I had an extra one on hand that I could add.  I also used half a small onion and half the lime.  Next time, I will definitely try cilantro.

Originally was very inspired by this recipe.  I have since added twice the garlic, more tomatos, twice the lime, a generous amount of my favorite hot sauce (Tapatillo) and cilantro to arrive at a very chuncky and delightful dish.  Great spread on sandwiches instead of mayo.  Get your veggies the tasty and healthy way.

Great!  Waaay better than store bought, super easy, too.  I used too much lime juice with the one lime, though but was still good. Love the cilantro.  Will make again.

This was a really yummy guacamole.  I've never made guacamole before, but I love restaurant kinds, and this is just as good!  Mine as a bit on the sour side cause I think I added too much lime juice, but it's still awesome.  Thanks!

This was the best guacamole.  I grew up on Mexican food in California & ever since moving to the midwest I have had a hard time finding good guacamole.  The store bought kind doesn't taste right.  But this was wonderful!!  I am so glad I found this recipe & that you shared it.

My goodness, this was so simple and so good!  My partner is of Latin descent and LOVES guacamole but often complains that the store-bought guacamole is lacking something.  This was lacking nothing!  It was so good that even after we ate, my girfriend sat on the couch just eating the guacamole plain!  Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe!

The only thing I changed was I added 2.5 table spoons of fat free sour cream and salt and pepper. There were 4 of us who tried the guacamole, 3 out the 4 of us thought it was the best. My husband who really doesn't like guacamole thought it was o.k. I will make this again.

This is a great guacamole recipe. Just how I like it.  I did not have any lime juice on hand so I substituted lemon juice.  My mom says this beats every store-bought or restaurant's guacamole.

SO GOOD.  I tweaked a couple of things to fit my taste.  Two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Omitted the tomato, although it would have been fine in there.  Added Ortega green chillis and cilantro.  So easy and delicious.  Good with chips or tortillas.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I think it could have used a little more kick, but I got no complaints.

I impressed my friends with this recipe!  They all thought it was great and couldn't believe it was my first attempt at making Guacamole.  Yum!  Definitely double if you are making it for a party, etc.

Yum!!  I absolutely love guacamole and this was the first time I tried making it myself.  My 7 year old loved it too.  Very easy to modify to suit individual tastes as well.  Definitely a keeper!

This is wonderful! My husband and I loved it!  Our kids, ages 7 and 4, wouldn't even attempt it so I guess that's the only place where this guacamole isn't 100%, but they're kids and that just means there's more for me!

This is simply the best guacamole I have had!  I've made it several times over the last few weeks and everyone wants the recipe.  The lime and salt are what makes it so yummy.  So EASY too!

I cut the onion back to 1/2 cup and make sure it's chopped fine.  I used a large Roma tomato and added 2 tbsp of chopped fresh cilantro.  You can add a pinch of cayenne if you want.  Great for dipping or with fahitas.

This was excellent. I used all the lime juice listed in the recipe and thought it enhanced it but wasn't overpowering. I had a bunch of fresh cilantro and threw that in. My daughter always orders the tableside made guacamole at our favorite Mexican restaurant and she thought it just as delicious. Thank you!

I made this. I found that the ratio of ingredients was off. Luckily, I had two extra avocados, so I used 4 avocados to balance out the onion, etc. It turned out really well!

Good recipe, but I would use only half the amount of onion recommended (otherwise it overpowers the taste), a half lime instead of whole (especially with only two avocados!) and a pinch of cayenne pepper to add a little "punch."  Also, to avoid browning, press some plastic wrap onto the top of the guacamole before you put the top on your container.  Some people use a little extra lime juice on top - which works - but I think that the plastic wrap works better.  It's all about avoiding exposure to oxygen until you are ready to serve.

Great simple recipe. I wasn't exact with the measurements and used dried chopped onions rather than a fresh onion, but it turned our really delicious.

I used 3 avocados, I added a little raw elephant garlic and plenty of lime juice, fresh lightly spicy peppers and on serving, left the seed in middle of dish.  It looked special and I believe it keeps the guacamole from turning colors so fast.  I probably won’t buy store bought guacamole again.  Sooo good!

Make sure avocado isn’t over ripe or the guacamole won’t last. I used lemon instead of lime, and tomato paste instead of tomato...don’t recommend these substitutes!

Very good recipe. Just what I was wanting. I did sauté the onion in a little olive oil and added a little cilantro, but just because of personal preference.

Amazing.  Great flavor and really easy!  
I only had one avocado, so I had to tweak it a little.  One avocado, 2 tbsp. chopped onion, 1 tbsp lime juice, 1/4 cup tomato, 1 tbsp sour cream, a tsp chopped cilantro, and some salt and pepper.  It was just great.  Next time, I will do everything the same as this, but double it, because my kids will devour it.

At first I thought this might not have a great flavor without cilantro, but I was wrong! I also normally use onion powder, but the fresh onions were great! I will use this again. So simple.. Great flavor!

Made my own delicious version. Thank you for the inspiration! I used a bit over half of a  lemon instead of lime, and used 3 crushed garlic cloves instead of one. I also added a good dash of both regular and green Tabasco sauce. It was fabulous with a small chopped head of romain lettuce, 2 big (3 small) seasoned chopped cooked chicken breast, and about a cup of crushed nacho chips. It fed two adults a delicious salad meal.

Great guac recipe! If you don't like that much onion, just use less. That's the beauty of sharing a recipe (not everyone has the same tastes, so you just adjust). I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love the simplicity of this recipe!  However, I used fresh cilantro instead of onions and garlic as I thought this would be more authentic.   Everyone loved it!   Sorry, I did not measure the cilantro so can't share that detail.

I would cut the onion out totally, or just use a tablespoon full of minced onion.
Added a dash of salt. This will be amazing next time, with less onion!!

I would not have liked an entire onion in this guacamole, so I didn’t add it. I also discovered that an entire lime was too much for my taste as well. Other than these two things, this guacamole is how I like mine...simple, with no cayenne or cilantro or other added ingredients.

I have tried to make  Guacamole before but with never much success, taste is never right and then it turns an ugly color if left for more than a day. This was amazing! Super easy to make although for my personal taste I did cut back on the onion. Had leftover for another day and it was still the nice green color it should be. I did like another reviewers suggestion of adding salsa instead so might try that just to cut time preparing.

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe cuz I only had one avocado but I think I added a bit to much lime juice. It's still yummy.  I did add some cilantro (1/2 tsp) as well cuz I noticed most other recipes had some. I'm not sure if it made that much difference though.  I give this 5 stars easily!! 
Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I didn't have a tomato, so I used a little bit of a jar of salsa. Turned out great!

It is easy and taste good but it's really just avocado dip. When you add the cilantro,. cayenne and ground cumin it's still easy but then it's guacamole.

I used 1/2 the onion and 2 Tbsp of lime juice. Otherwise, we loved this recipe.  Very easy and quickly prepared.

I would make this again. It was simple to make and it was delicious.  Next time I would probably like to add a little more seasoning.  It was as good or better than anything I have purchased at the store and it has zéro mayonaise...

It's just as it says - easy guacamole - ingredients are simple enough. It is definitely a 'make to taste' recipe as avocados, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and limes can vary in size.

I added some fresh chopped parsley (since I didn't have any cilantro) to give it more flavour, and made sure to use some very ripe and soft avocados for a smoother texture.

I washed out the seeds and juice from the tomato before dicing it so it would not over power the taste of the avocado.
Tip: the more finely chopped the onion and garlic is, the better so it is not as pungent and the flavours blend better.

Simple, easy recipe for a great dip/ snack.
Would make it again.

This guacamole is delicious! Don't change the recipe. It's simple and perfect. If you like spicy, I'd add a FEW finely diced jalapeños. Otherwise perfect and great with the Pico de Gallo quesadilla recipe.

I changed it up a little bit, but it was pretty good.  A whole onion would have been too much IMO.  I put in less onion, added some cilantro and used a fairly small tomato.  It turned out good, but I felt like something was lacking in the flavor (I suspect I should have used a lot more salt).  My whole family really liked it though.

I tried this because of the speed, simplicity, and the fact my wife does not like cilantro.  We both enjoyed it.  I will be working on variations, but the basic recipe is great.

When I made this I didn't have a tomato so I tossed in some salsa in place of it.  It turned out very well.  I'll for sure make it again, hopefully with an actual tomato next time.  I may also add a couple of dashes of hot sauce.

Will definitely make it again. Just too easy to modify up on the flavor crank.

We added some frozen chopped jalapenos that we had from a previous recipe, another whole avocado and about a 1/2 t sea salt. For the tomatoes all we had in the house were cans of diced organic tomatoes, regular sized can. Added about half that can after draining.

The trick though is storing as long as possible without the oxidizing color change. Even limed guacamole can go brown early. We placed the rest in as small a storage container as possible and right before sealing, placed some cellophane airtight right on the guac, not stretched over the plastic container rim but laying airless on the guacamole that we spread flat with a spoon, like icing a cake for a smooth surface. This greatly reduces browning from trapped air.

Overall great but I would make adjustments. Adding the whole lime was too much for two avocadoes. I'd use half.

I'm not a guacamole guy so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like.  I found recipes thagt n called for everything from cayenne to salsa but when deciding on a recipe to make for my chick, I decided simple was better.  I made this recipe as written leaving out the tomatoes (she's not a fan and I've not seen them in locally made guac) and it turned out delicious.  I don't know where I picked up my aversion to guac but my chick loves it and she's asked me to keep this recipe on hand and in regular rotation for mexican style dinner nights and as an occasional snack with chips.  Give it a try.

Great, easy base recipe! I made the changes of other reviewers: Use only the juice of 1/2 of a lime. Add chopped cilantro, green scallions, couple T of salsa (instead of chopped tomato onion), and 1 T sour cream (for creaminess). Family loved it! Will make this again!

I often add fresh cilantro this is a very basic and great tasting . I think the easiest thing is I don't chop the avacodo much just use my spoon to stir and slice with the side of the spoon. GREAT TASTE often add a fresh tomatoe for color taste also.

I didn't follow exact measurements because I used like about 8 avocados but I used all the ingredients and it was a big hit.  I was told it taste like chipotle guacamole.  Not sure if that's a compliment but it was easy.

This was very good. I did use dried onion flakes and since it could sit a couple hours they reconstituted and didn't take away from the flavor. Everything else was as stated.  I have stored the recipe as a go to for guacamole.

Simple, easy and delicious.  Everything you need to make great tasting guacamole without over powering the taste with other ingredients.  Important to let recipe rest in refrigerator for at least 39 minutes to allow the flavors to blend together.

Easy and fast.  I adore tomatoes, so there's no way I'm skimping on them.  I do prefer using onion powder, instead of real onion.  I've used freshly squeezed lemon juice, instead of lime juice, in a pinch and it's still good.  This is the kind of recipe one can play with and customize, so enjoy!

So easy & simple, and allows for you to add your own touches; I love it. I've used this recipe twice this week. The first time, it was ok (I think my avocado was slightly past its prime), yet definitely edible - I gobbled it; but this second time, whoo! The avocado was in a great state and I added more seasoning (salt & pepper, garlic powder) and it was fantastic. The only alterations I made was a little extra tomato (b/c I love tomato) and I subbed out garlic powder for fresh garlic, since I had none. I also added fresh hand-chopped cilantro - probably about a tbsp (I think I used less the first time; this was for "8 servings"). I will definitely come back to this recipe the next time I'm craving guac. It's a great base for those new to making it!

It was awesome even before I let it sit.  I didn't measure the onion or the tomatoes.  I made it on how much I wanted of each.  I did use 1/2 squeeze lime and one large clove of minced garlic.  This is the best guacamole I have ever tasted and so easy.  I wouldn't change a thing!!!

This is very close to the recipe I have used for years.  I have always used fresh lemons instead of limes.  But 2 Tablespoons of juice should be enough for 2 avocados.  I, also, use salsa instead of tomato, but a good tomato is heard to beat.  I want to comment on how to store leftovers.  Just put a light layer of salsa on top to cover all areas of the guac or cut up a small tomato and spread with the juice from the tomato over the guac.

This is very similar to a table side preparation I learned in San Antonio decades ago.  But this recipe lacks heat so add a seemed, minced jalapeño and/ or Tabasco to taste. Another hint - add a squeeze of fresh orange juice...the sweetness makes it!

I use mayo, salso and onion salt to taste with a small half teaspoon of lemon juice. Put all iteams into the blender for 20 seconds and it's so creamy for chips, burritors, tacos and etc.

This is good. I love onion.. But it's too much. I used a red onion and only used about a quarter. Also ended up doubling the garlic.

This was very easy to make, which was good for me since I'm not a veteran cook.  The flavors were just "good".  Nothing spectacular.  I followed the recipe exactly but something was just missing.  Maybe I didn't add enough salt?  But I didn't want to add too much for sodium reasons.  I'll probably make it again because it was good but I might just add something else to give it more pizzazz.  As for the portions, I don't see how this would feed 16 people.  It would be about 1-2 tablespoons per person for 16 people.  I made it for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 young kids) and we barely had any left.  And we didn't eat a lot each, just a handful of chips each to dip in the guac.  My avocados were normal size.    But thank you for the recipe!  I'll try again.

Very simple and super delicious. My personal addition was like 3 large Serrano peppers blended to a pulp and mixed into the guac. Would only recommend if you are a spice fanatic.

It was amazing and sense I didn't have actual cloves or onions the onion power and garlic seasoning worked really well especially it would be a waste not to use all of the onion and garlic sense this was the only time I would use this. But it tasted absolutely amazing!!!

My go to guacamole recipe. I have made this countless times. You can easily modify based on what you have on hand. I don't always add lime juice. I've used canned diced tomatoes or garlic powder. It's always good.

I have made this more than once.  Sometimes I add a little hot sauce to it, but most of the time I just like it the way it's written.  I often use it as a "spread" for sandwiches.  Very fresh, and yummy!

I added a 1/2 cup of chopped jicama.  It adds a sweetness and crunch.

Easy and tasty. Can add other items easily such as spinach, spices, hot sauce but this recipe is very good as presented.

I didn't use black pepper and add in chopped up cilantro. For some spice, I chop up some serrano or jalapeño peppers!

I love the final product with some changes. Instead of a small onion I used green onions, I added a dash of olive oil, I used a whole lime because that's the taste I love, and  fresh chopped cilantro. This is the best guacamole I've ever had.

This is way too much onion for 2 avocados! When I make it I use 1/2 of a small onion or 1 shallot. I also use 1-2 cloves minced garlic, and about a tablespoon of canned chopped green chilies. Depending on how juicy the lemon or lime is I use 1/2- 1 lemon/lime, whatever I have on hand. Salr to taste. We don't care for tomatoes in our guacamole so I omit it. The canned chopped green chilies just add a good flavor and makes it taste so much like the guacamole in the Mexican restaurants in our area!

I made this the first time following the recipe and turned out great! Made the second time with red onions to give it a kick.  I made it with  very crispy crumbled bacon and it was gone at the party I took it too.
So a great party dish, and too keep it sprinkle lime juice over the top the same day you make it so it doesn't turn color.

Nice and easy recipe. Maybe the onion is a bit too much, but I guess it depends on how small is the onion..
All and all very nice

I've fixed this same recipe many many times - it's perfect! When you're limited to what's in your fridge - you can use lemon juice vs. the lime. A great addition is adding some cilantro, but it's great without it too!

Quick and easy guacamole, that is delicious.  I only needed a small amount of guacamole to go with chicken enchiladas.   I scaled the recipe down using only one avocado.   Served the guacamole with chicken enchiladas and sliced peaches.

This is perfect!I didn't have any onion and we like it spicy so I added some red pepper flakes and I used lemon juice (about a tablespoon, next time I'll use less) and using garden fresh tomatoes made it just awesome.

I have made this guacamole at least three times since discovering the recipe. It whips up quick and tastes great, plus I can control the salt which is a must since my husbands heat attack. Its so fast and easy I couldn't believe it, plus as someone who swore they hated avocados all my life I've now developed a taste for them thanks to this recipe.

This is a good basic guac recipe. A friend of my son's told me next time to leave the guacamole seed in the dip, and it won't turn brown. I had already thrown out my seed or I would have tried. He also suggested using green onions and vidalia (sweet) onions.

The only reason I gave 4* because you don't need  a whole lime juice. Try with a quarter and if you need add more. I put a whole lime juice and it ruined the whole thing. Before I put the lime in it was great. And maybe add some cilantro. Otherwise a good one

Simple guacamole, this was the second time I've made it and it was very good. I will use the Hass avocados in future, although the regular green were fine, the Hass are IMHO better.

My 9-year old made this almost entirely by herself - needed a little help cutting the avocado because they were not ripe, which made me worry, but the guacamole still turned out awesome.

Enjoyed this recipe. Cut the onion in half which was a good idea because it was a potent onion.

Great recipe, but I did tweak it a bit.  Instead of putting in the onion and tomato like recommended, I bought some fresh pico de gallo from the store produce section that has onion, tomato, jalapeno and cilantro in it and I put in two heaping Tablespoons.  I added a little more lime juice and it was astounding.  I will make this from now on.

i accidentally forgot about the onion and had to substitute lemon for the lime juice, and it was still more than delicious. i never thought that it would be so easy to make guacamole at home.

This is DELICIOUS!!! I took the advice of another review and used about two tablespoons of salsa instead of the tomato and onion. I didn't even wait for it to chill and it was still really yummy! Definitly will be using this recipe when I need a guacamole recipe!

Easy!!  Delicious!!  My daughter was so excited she said, "Let's never BUY guacamole again!". Of course you need good avocados but it WAS amazing. 

I use avocados a lot ... Just slice in "half" (will stop at pit), twist-and-pull to separate, smack kife into pit to anchor in pit and twist-and-pull again to get pit out of second half, then quarter and peel by hand.  If avocado is remotely ripe enough for guac, the skin will zip right off easier than a banana peel.

Anyway, I followed all of "Annie's" recommendations ... Added cilantro, only juice of 1/2 lime, capful vinegar, garlic salt. I skipped sour cream, scallions and salsa in favor of one slice of onion in tiny dice and 1/4 - 1/2 Roma tomato for color (went light by kids don't like tomato, heavier if you like it). Basically, flavor to taste and you can't go wrong. And, although it was delicious immediately, I was surprised and delighted that  was even better after 30 min in fridge. YUMMY!!!  First time making guac and I've found the perfect recipe!  Thx for sharing!!

Great side dish, too much onion in my opinion, makes your breath reek so maybe half of one is enough and make it very finely chopped!

Excellent recipe. I used a red onion and only one slice chopped. It really was perfect. I seasoned it with sea salt. It would probably be great on pasta too. I have some spinach noodles so I may try it that way, adding some of the pasta cooking water to loosen the mix.

Pretty darned good!  I used 3 avacados (recipe calls for 2), though, and that ratio to the other ingredients, seems to suit our taste well.  Easy and fast recipe, too.

This was perfect for spur of the moment guacamole.  I substituted some garlic salt for the minced garlic and added half a jalapeño that I had leftover from Refried Beans Without the Refry.  My family gobbled it up and we wished we had more!  Next time we will add a bit of cilantro and see how that tastes.

Tasty and easy recipe.  I added quite a bit of salt and a couple dashes of cumin.  I think next time I will add some tabasco or cayenne for a bit of kick.

Now this is Guacamole!  Only I chop a few Jalapeno's.  Also to keep from turning brown, just leave in one of the pits.

Good recipe. I use Roma tomatoes (seeded), 1 Jalapeno (minced without seeds), and juice from half a lemon. Easy and delicious appetizer for get-togethers!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars except I changed some things a bit.  I used half an onion, the juice of 2 limes and no garlic. Delicious.

Our friends didn't respond as positively as we hoped- This recipe only got 2.5 stars. It was easy, but was missing something. It seemed a little bland to us.

A good base, but didn't really care for the chunks of garlic and onions. I would recommend running the entire thing through a food proccesor to blend and evenly distribute the flavors more.

Oh my goodness, this is so good.  This tastes like the guacamole we had on our trip to Mexico.  As other reviewers did, I added a teaspoon or so of olive oil and a splash of vinegar.

Tasty! I left out the onion and added 3 tablespoons of minced fresh cilantro, a dash of olive oil, and a dash of white vinegar. I also used bottled lime juice instead of fresh.

Left out the tomato and onion (I like a fairly simple guac) and it turned out fabulous!  Everyone loved it on Mexican night with the lime chips, chicken enchiladas and margaritas!  Definitely a keeper for me, this is the ONLY guac recipe I'll ever need or use! Thanks!

This was really good and easy. I used salsa instead of a tomato and lemon juice instead of lime. The great thing about guacamole is you can fudge on some of the ingredients.

Excellent recipe! I modified this slightly for the ingredients I had on hand: i used two small avocados, 1/4 red onion, 3tbsps or so of salsa, a splash of lemon juice, a small clove of garlic and a few twists of ground sea salt. Delicious and Quick!

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is always a hit and always requested.  I use red onion instead of regular and sometimes some tabasco sauce.  I usually find it needs more salt after it comes out of the refrigerator.

I think this is a great, simple recipe.  I have tried many different guacamole recipes, some that are more elaborate than this one, but this recipe consistently gets the highest marks from guests even with its simple, few ingredients.  I think the simplicity of the recipe really lets the natural flavor of the avocado come through.  Love it!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  My only suggestion is to add some cayenne pepper, which can be adjusted to taste.  It adds that little extra flavor.

This was great! I made it exactly as suggested and it was perfect. My mom thought it was a little too lime-y, so I added a TINY bit of mayonnaise for her and she loved it too. My first guacamole ever and I am very happy.

Though not a guacamole connoisseur, I thought this was pretty good.  However, when my husband tasted it, he thought something was missing so he kept adding stuff to try to add more "oomph" to it.

I don't eat guacamole, but made this for a dinner I went to last night.  Everyone seemed to like it enough.  The only difference is that i chopped in a little bit of cilantro.  Will be making this again for my guacamole eating friends.

Best guacamole ever, and so simple! This recipe makes a ton, I usually cut it in half. Great on chips, and fajitas.

This was pretty good...but not the best guacamole I've had.  I also found it to be a bit bland as someone else stated.  The problem may have been the size of avacadoes...I had really large avacodoes, so it probably needed a little more of everything else.

Definitly an easy recipe, but I personally found it a bit bland. Also I found that the onion was a bit much and would only use half a small onion for this quantity next time.

Very easy and a great basic recipe. I wouldn't recommend upping the garlic without upping the other ingredients.... I put two cloves in, and it was VERY garlicky!!!!

Wonderful taste:)  I used 3 avacodos and added a seeded jalepeno to it as well as 2 slices of red onion as that is what i had available.  Can't wait to make again.  Will double recipe without hesitation.  10 Stars IMHO.

I gave this a four because I'm grateful that it was so easy and the ingredients are all there to make perfect guacamole!  I would have given it a five but I had to change a few things.  I used 4 avocados and only 1/4 of an onion.  I also only used 1/2 a lime and only one slice of tomato chopped.  It's a good thing I doubled the avocado.  I tasted so much while I was cooking that it would have been gone!

This was really tasty and easy to make.  My husband ate the whole thing in one sitting! I did make some slight changes, though.  I took some others advice and cut back on the onion and only used 1/2 a small onion, and it was still pretty oniony, which is fine because we like onions.  But, if you aren't a big onion lover, I'd cut to about 1/4 of an onion.  I also added cilantro, which also added some great flavor.

This is a really good guacamole recipe and so easy to make.  The only thing I would change is maybe adding a more cayenne pepper.  As suggested in other reviews, I cut back on the salt (about half) and it was plenty salty.

I made this today and it turned out great! I omitted the onion and added a few tablespoons of homemade salsa (which had onions in it). If not adding salsa I would advise to add some cilantro and chopped tomatoes. I found the salsa added a nice contract in texture and flavor addition.

I just finished making this recipe for a cookout we are attending tonight.  It only took about 10 minutes to prepare and the initial samples taste wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The tomatoes add just enough color to make it festive looking.

This was FANTASTIC!!  So easy to make, too.  I used garlic salt instead of regular.  Also, I didn't end up using the lime because I felt like it was fine without it.  I'm sure the lime would have been yummy, but I was so pleased with how it tasted before hand, I didn't want to risk ruining it.  This is DEFINITLEY going into the recipe book!  :)

I ommitted half of the lime as suggested. But then I felt like it needed something, so I squirted in a tablespoon or so of lemon. Tasted great!

Easy to make, but needed the cilantro as others suggested to make it very good! Don't mash the avocado in the food processor though or it will brown up even faster!!!!

At first I labeled this recipe with 3 stars, however I have to change my recipe to 5 stars because everytime I make guacamole I use this recipe.

I had never made homemade gucamole before, so I wasnt sure what to expect...I think for homemade it was pretty good...but it wasnt like you can get at carlos o kellys or something like that. But I would try to make it again. Make sure to let the flavors blend!

Excellent!  Very easy and very tasty!  I've never made guacamole because I thought it was difficult, but this actually took less than 10 minutes to prepare.

I've made guacamole before - it took forever and never turned out as good as our favorite mexican restaurant.  This recipe is fast, easy to put together, and tastes wonderful.  Will definitely be making it again for parties or just for us!

I wasn't in love with this recipe.  I'm wondering if I possibly used the wrong kind of avocadoes.  I'm still searching for something as good as what I can get at Mexican restaurants.

This is the easiest and best guacamole recipe I've found so far. I usually put quite a bit more garlic. It's perfect.

Very good recipe. Great to use as a base and then add in your favorite stuff. I added some cumin, red pepper flakes and cilantro, wonderful flavor. Also, instead of salt and pepper, I used a cajun seasoning called Slap Ya Mama. Great recipe Denise. Thanks for sharing.

My husband doesn't usually like guacamole but absolutely loved this one. It truly is amazingly good and will replace all other recipes that I currently have for guacamole.
Quick, easy, and wonderful - thank you!!

Awesome! I couldn't wait to let it sit in the fridge, but I forced myself to.
