I made this for Christmas Eve, which is when we have our turkey and it was my favorite of the variety of stuffings I made. Lots of flavours and nice and moist. Thank you for the recipe

This is an easy and fun Thanksgiving stuffing that can be made sweet or salty depending on your feasting guests.  Kids love the sweeter version and it's nice to know that's no added sugar.

I made this for Thanksgiving and no one really liked it. It was a little too tangy.

I thought a fruity stuffing would be yummy but guess it is not my thing.

was good, but very different.  My family was hesitant to try it, but they enjoyed it very much.

I used garlic bread chunks and added dates as I was short on raisins. And I didn't peep the apples. It was so good, sweet and crunchy, though I made it for a large thanksgiving meal and there were lots of leftovers that looked a bit grey and unappetizing after the day. Maybe I over cooked it, but with apples it's not going to preserve well. But yummy with gravy and lighter than most stuffings.

Our family enjoyed this stuffing a lot although I made the following changes. I added 1 cup of the apple cider, 1 cup of the cranberries and omitted the raisins and walnuts. I also added some chicken broth to moisten it more.
