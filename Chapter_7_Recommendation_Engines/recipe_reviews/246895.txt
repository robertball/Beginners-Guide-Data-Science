I made everything as written, except used shrimp instead of chicken. Next time I'll add even more veggies! Water chestnuts, peas, bean sprouts, all of it would be amazing in this. I also mixed them all together in the end and topped with sesame seeds. Delicious! The sauce is what makes it, and it's super easy!

This dinner was amazing and so easy to make!!  I try not to make any changes to the recipes, but because our local food store did not carry peanut oil, I changed that out and used Olive Oil.  Also, I did use Udon noodles (as one reviewer suggested) rather than Ramen noodles, which I am glad I did.  These noodles are more expensive, but the package contained three bundled servings, and one bundle was perfect for the meal.  The flavors in this dish were a treat to the taste bud's and my husband even commented that this meal is a keeper.  In addition, I did velvet my chicken, which I saw on this site, Velveting Chicken Breast, Chinese Restaurant-Style.  I will be doing this to my chicken from now on. It was so moist and tender.  Thank you Shelley for an awesome meal!

This is really good. I made it with udon not Ramen and added Suracha, soy sauce, and a few different veggies but it was really good. I had to add some water to the base sauce so it would coat everything as it thickened. This is a keeper in my book for sure!

very tasty. I made it as the recipe direct and we really enjoyed the fresh flavor.
this time was the first four ramen noodles for us and thus from now on it'll be rice.  I'll also reserve some of the sauce as there is enough for 2 or 3 dinners.  I figure it would be just as tasty with about 1/3 the sauce.  

very good though

Fantastic! I substituted broccoli for asparagus and added soy sauce. Used Japanese buckwheat noodles instead of the ramen noodles. Truly amazing.
