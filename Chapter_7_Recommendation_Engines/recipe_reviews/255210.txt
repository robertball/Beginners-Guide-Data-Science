I didn't want to take time to roll out a bunch of balls for dinner rolls, so I scaled the recipe to 18 servings, thinking it would make one large loaf. The dough more than doubled in size--it more than tripled from all the yeast! I made a 9X5 loaf and an 8X4 loaf, and they doubled in size before the 30 minutes was up. The bread is very light and yeasty. It was very soft yesterday when I made it. However, today, it is rather crumbly and losing it's softness. I'm thinking that's probably from using the coconut oil. I spread unsalted butter on the tops instead of using coconut oil. On the 3rd day, I had to throw out the extra loaf I had made. The flavor was not very good after sitting, and it dried out quickly. This really was only good the day it was made. The submitter says it can be made into a loaf, but maybe rolls would have held up better.
