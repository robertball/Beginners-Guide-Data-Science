This is a fabulous recipe that I use each year when making holiday cookies.  These cookies always are the first to go!

I made these cookies for a Christmas cookie exchange party! They are great!  I used a 1 inch scoop/baller. When the cookies were done baking I had  perfectly round 2 inch cookies.  Warning::: This recipe made exactly 72. If you are counting on 72 cookies there is no extra dough for nibbling on. I needed exactly 72... Phew!!!!  These are really really good cookies. My friends all loved them. How could you ever go wrong with eagle brand recipes???? This is a keeper in my book!

Yummy! I used a whole cherry instead of cutting them in half. I also drizzled the frosting on top instead of covering the cookie. That way you could see the cherry.

These were very yummy and easy to make.  I made 13 dozen for a cookie exchange.  I also used my 1-inch scoop, and since the dough's not sticky, it was really quick & easy.  To make the frosting, I found mine turned out better if I made it in the microwave.  Heat condensed milk and chips together for 1 minute and stir - chips should be melted.  Heat for 3 more minutes, stirring after each minute.  Also, I didn't frost them all because they were pretty and tasty without the frosting too.

this is an old favorite recipe that my now grown kids have enjoyed for years.  I lost the magazine that I found it in originally and was so excited to find it here. Each year I host a Cookie Exchange party at the holidays and am so excited to find this recipe so I can make them again this year.

I have made these cookies for the last couple of years.  They make great gifts and are often requested around the holidays by my family and friends!
