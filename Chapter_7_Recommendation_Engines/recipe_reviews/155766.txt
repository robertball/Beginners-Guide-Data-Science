The taste is okay but nothing to brag about so two stars for taste.  The chicken had a purple and gray cast to it from the marinade but it ruined it too. I'm a pretty good cook but I just didn't like the looks of this dish and it really made it hard to even try to eat it.  My husband wouldn't touch it but the brave girls at my office all tried it and that's how I got the taste rating.  I would not make this dish again nor would I attempt to fix it.

Very good. Next time I will use less salt though.

This was pretty good. My chicken breasts were pretty thick so I poured the marinade over them and sprinkled the shallots and thyme on top and baked them in the oven. The chicken turned out moist and delicious. Next time I will use a little more balsamic vinegar.

This recipe was just ok. I was able to use the leftovers in a wrap with hummus, spinach, and red onion. As far as it turning purple, yeah, it does that. Its a marinade, it happens. The flavor wasn't very pronounced, just ok. In the future I might try some other seasonings to help develop a more complex taste. I also think I might prefer this marinade on beef.

It's decent.  I used Paul Newman's balsamic vinaigrette and just a basic cooking red wine.  I ended up marinating it for 5 hours as they were big thick chicken breasts.  For that same reason, I ended up cooking it in the oven with the marinade.  The marinade does taste like it would be better suited for red meat.
