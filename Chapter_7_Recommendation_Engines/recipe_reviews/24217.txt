Well, I had to change a couple of things, but it came out swell.  First I didn't put in the bell pepper, because I'm the only one in the family that likes it.  Second, I upped the chicken to 2 cups (I made two quiche) and so I also doubled the egg, milk, sour cream amounts.  I added extra cheese to both quiches (probably an extra 1/2 to each). It came out beautifully, loved it, will make again.

About the ONLY thing to change was the cooking time - after I reduced the heat and continued cooking it, it was not done in 35 minutes, took an extra 15 to 20 minutes extra.  I would put it on the top rack and cook it the entire 50 to 55 minutes at 400.  Very yummy recipe.

I was having trouble deciding whether to make my standard quiche lorraine or to try this recipe. After reading the reviews and learning that this recipe needed more salt, I thought i would try combining the two recipes.  I used this recipe (minus the nutmeg) and added crumbled bacon.  Used the bacon grease instead of olive oil and used more cheese. I didn't use a crust (I always make quiche crustless) and served with a tossed salad and buttermilk buscuits. Got rave reviews.  This may become my new standard quiche.

The sour cream makes this recipe. It was delicious. I omitted the nutmeg as putting it in would not have made me popular with my family. I'm glad I left it out, as I don't think it would have been a good fit in this recipe. This quiche is creamy and cheesy and has a pleasant tang to it, likely because of the sour cream and cheeses. I used red pepper instead of green, and had to add another cup of chicken. One cup alone was nowhere near enough.

I made this for dinner. I doubled this recipe for 2 quiches, leaving out the nutmeg, but adding in garlic and onion powder. I also had leftover egg mixture, since I used pre-made shallow pie crusts. It tasted wonderful. The sour cream is a nice touch. I like it best the next day, cold.

Good! Tasty and it helped clean out the fridge.  I used one cup diced ham instead of chicken and omitted the salt since ham has enough. Skipped the nutmeg as per other reviews.  Used 1 cup mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar & swiss and added 1 large chopped tomato.  Oh!  And I did not layer the egg mixture on top but rather mixed it together with all the other ingredients.

This was very good.  I made it for dinner & everyone really liked it.  I had to make a few changes since I didn't either have enough ingred. or none at all.  Didn't have green pepper, so had to omit (but, I think it could of used it--even a red pepper).  Didn't have enough cheese so sub. some grated asiago & cream cheese--tasted really good anyways.  Served a veggie on the side.  I think this may replace my old tried and true quiche recipe!

I love this recipe.  I skipped the nutmeg because I don't have any, but it is still delicious.  I made it for my parents while I was visiting, and they made me make it again the next day!  Thanks!

This was a great dish. Also my first time making quiche.  I added mushrooms and bacon into mine.  Didn't have any Swiss cheese so used all Cheddar as well as using Lite Sour Cream (cut the calories).  It came out fantastic. Could have used a deep dish pie crust because of the extra ingredients.  Also needed to bake longer than the recipe called for or at a higher temp the whole time. Overall great recipe though.

I did make a few changes, used my own pie crust instead of frozen, as I had read other reviews that said there was not enough filling I used a 7" pie plate, just enough egg mixture for that... Left out the nutmeg, added a little garlic to the onions and pepper, also added a little diced tomato to the quiche.  Very pleased with this quiche, I am sure that I will be using this recipe again.

Surprisingly very good. I always have quiches for breakfast so I had a hard time thinking chicken and quiche but made it for dinner and it was very good. I added garlic and chopped carrots and celery. It tasted a lot like chicken pot pie. Yummy!!

It was a success amongst my Turkish family. They dont eat pork, so Im always in the search for non-bacon or sausages recipes. They loved it...Im not Turkish but I enjoy cooking for them.

This recipe leaves a lot to be desired and needs major tweaking.  I followed the recipe too a tee and it was pretty bland.  I won't be making this again.

Creamy, fluffy, consistent mixture (when you mix the first layer ingredients with the milk mixture). Just mix everything together Not eggy as most quiches are.  We used whole spelt flour and baked it in a spelt pie crust  (store bought).   No par baking for this one. Very very good.  Sour cream was a good add as it made it very creamy without actually tasting the sour cream.  Will totally make it again.

This recipe has become a staple for me.  I was totally new to making quiche and this recipe was easy to follow and delicious.  I now get creative and modify it for many different meals.  My husband and friends LOVE it and you will too, the nutmeg definitely adds another dimension to it!

This recipe is delicious, but the egg/sour cream/milk portion needs to be AT LEAST doubled in order to make a substantial quiche!  Mine was way too thin to be called a quiche.  Also, taste the chicken mixture before adding more salt--I added more salt based on other reviews and the quiche ended up too salty for my family.

I made my own pie crust (I am not fond of the frozen ones).  To make the roux I added a 1/2 Tbls. of butter because after sauteing the onion & pepper in the oil, there wasn't enough oil for a good roux.  I think also that one could add another 1/2 cup (max.) of liquid as the amount given was  not quite enough.  Am not sure if the 9-inch crusts you buy are the exact same size as a homemade one. I think the pre-made are a bit smaller so this recipe would be fine for the frozen one.
The taste and texture of the end result is EXCELLENT.

This was delicious!  I modified it just a bit by adding a little bacon (pre-cooked) with the chicken.  Also, I used egg substitute instead of eggs, light sour cream, fat-free milk, and 2% milk cheddar.  I baked it in a stoneware pan, so it took about 5 minutes longer at the higher temperature, and about 5-7 minutes longer (than the 35 minutes) when it was switched to the lower temperature.  Overall, it was very easy to make, and very tasty.  I will definitely make this again!

This was my first quiche.  I used leftover turkey instead of chicken, and used a combination of shredded taco cheese and laughing cow cheese wedges, because that's what I had.  I omitted the nutmeg and added an extra egg, and then mixed everything together instead of layering it.  It came out just how I wanted it to!  Will definitely make again, and probably make my own variations.  
EDIT -- Made it again with leftover turkey this year, my boyfriend had me make it twice, he loves it so much!  I keep using different cheeses, and it's still turned out great.  His complaint is that it's not eggy enough, so I've been adding a couple more.  But I love how well it comes out each time!

Very yummy and the sour cream gives it a great texture.  I added bacon bits and lotsa cheese.

I love how easy this dish is. If you have leftover chicken then it really is super fast & easy. It had a really good flavor from the sour cream. The only change I made was to substitute fresh minced garlic (which I sauted with the peppers & onions) for the nutmeg. I just didn't think nutmeg would go well in a quiche.  It was a nice change from traditional quiche and made for a great weeknight dinner.  I paired it with a green salad and my whole family really liked it.

Exceptionally easy and delicious!  I added some Spanish olives before pouring in egg mixture, and it added a good flavor.  I also baked for 1 hour at 400 degrees, covering the crust with tinfoil after 35 minutes to prevent further browning.

I did not like this at all.  My first taste was the top, which is only sour cream and eggs. My husband like it but said it would be even better if you mixed all the ingredients instead of putting them in layers

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is a quick and easy meal that doesn't feel like it is fast food.  I took the advice of others and just cooked the quiche on 400 degrees for about an hour.  I had a hard time telling when it was done but after the top begins to brown up you need to watch it carefully.  I would say that I enjoyed the quiche after it set up in the fridgerator the most, leftovers are the best!

I can't give this a high rating because I really just enjoyed the chicken..it's my fault because I hadn't had quiche before and didn't realize it tastes mostly like egg...not my favorite!  I think it'd be better without the entire top egg part, though I know that's what makes it quiche.

I'd give this a 4.5. Thick when mixed together, but turns out fine. Make sure not to overcook. (top gets a little brown, so watch it.) I used a 6 oz package of pre-cooked, chopped chicken!

Yum! Made quiche almost according to recipe - omitted bell pepper and nutmeg - made everything else as stated. Husband and kids - who aren't big fans of eggs and egg dishes asked for seconds! The chicken I used was from the rotisserie chicken I had in the fridge. Fast easy and yummy! Will make again!

Good recipe. One change I would suggest is to make your own pie crust. Not hard and SOOO much better than store bought! Folks seem to think it's hard, but it's not!

Very easy and most people have all ingredients always on hand. I also just threw in about a 3/4 cup of cooked rice because I didn't want it to go to waste, it didn't add or detract from the taste.  I also served waffles on the side but that was merely because I wanted a waffle and knew my kids would eat those. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Had family in town.... they haven't had quiche before. This was such a huge hit by everyone they all are going home living quiche!
That being said, I have made several quiches and thus is by far my favorite!

I'm actually making a double batch for my @in the go" breakfast (or any other meal) so I can pack it the night before I go to work. 

Awesome awesome dish!!!!!

Changes I made:
Used bacon crumbles for the meat and switched red pepper instead of green. 
More mild for my palate!
Didn't use all the seasoning listed as I didn't have them. 
Still. Great dish!

Great dish!

This turned out to taste like a dry chicken pot pie with egg on top.  Next time I'll add way less chicken and way more egg and veggies

This was easy to make.  I used left over roasted chicken, added an extra egg then topped up the measuring cup to 2 Cups with the sour cream then used a combo of milk/half&half cream.  I didn't use the nutmeg, used a garlic pepper combo instead.  Sprinkled a little chopped broccoli on top of it all.  I put it under a hot broiler to brown the top nice just before taking it out of the oven.....serve with a salad and Voila, a very nice dinner.  The hubby loved it, so yes, I'll make this again!

Delicious! .I thought the nutmeg tasted fine and so did my family. I didn't have green bell pepper so I used red and yellow combination. Also I used a 10 oz can of chicken breast and that was plenty of chicken. Perhaps, because I used can chicken the salt was fine. Very tasty. I will be adding this to my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. Nutmeg really makes it for me. I did it crust less and left out the flour. Also subbed cream for the milk. All for dietary reasons. I will make again but might mix it all together next time. Chicken is on the bottom and everything is on top

I made a few changes. I didn't use the bell pepper or nutmeg or milk. (I was out) So I used 1/2 cup chicken broth for the milk. I also added 1/2 cup of canned corn. Very tasty!

Yummy! The whole family loved it. I made some changes per other comments. I left out the nutmeg and cooked it at 400 degrees for 50-55 minutes. Came out perfect! I also added a little garlic before I popped it in the oven. This will be a regular at our house! Thanks!

Yummy!  I was a little nervous about the nutmeg, so I left it out also.  I agree with another reviewer that this is really good the next day.  I added shredded cheese, heated it up just a little, and topped it with sour cream.  It made a delicious lunch!

Love, Love, LOVED it! I doubled the recipe so we'd have some leftovers & am so glad that I did. My entire family thought this was divine. I used a rotisserie chicken from my local deli & doubled the salt like someone else suggested.  It was perfect. My small family of 3 ended up eating this for every meal & managed to eat both pies in 2 days.  My son is already asking that I make it again. This one is a keeper for sure! Thank you so much!!!

I think it had the potential to be really tasty however, the nutmeg ruined the entire dish.  I ended up throwing out over half because we just couldn't eat it.  I'll never make this again but if you do leave out the nutmeg!

I made this last night and it was quite delicious! I left out the nutmeg, but added in some mushrooms and crushed garlic.
I cooked it in a fan-forced oven and didn't need to have it in there for longer than suggested. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious! This was a nice variation from the ingredients that I usually put in my quiche. Maybe next time I'll throw in some diced red pepper for the added color.

Very good.  Great way to use leftover chicken/turkey.  Rather than add the flour to the vegetables, we used it to dredge the cheese.  We'll make this again.

Wonderful recipe. I've never made quiche before, but will continue to try different recipes after this one. My boyfriend ate almost the whole thing by himself. I, like many of the others who rated this recipe, didn't use nutmeg, as I didn't have any. Also, I added garlic salt when cooking the chicken. 10 stars!!

Very good!  I'm not a quiche lover, but was asked to make one for a church women's meeting.  I logged onto allrecipes.com and found this recipe.  Very easy, very good...and my quiche was gone in no time.  Thanks for helping me out Katherine!

I made this exactly like the Recipe called for. And it turned out gorgeous and tasted great. It is now one of my favorite quiche recipes. I did include the nutmeg as I do in much of my cooking, it’s an Italian trick that add something very special to food, but you don’t even know that it’s there!

Added more chicken and plenty garlic. It didn't last long in my house.

The only change I made to this was to omit the nutmeg as many others suggested, and I subbed in garlic and onion powder and added half a jalapeño to the green pepper and onion. The boyfriend gave it a thumbs up and went back for seconds. I liked it,  but I think adding another half (or maybe even another one entirely) jalapeño, more onions & bell pepper and mixing it all together rather than layering it would make it more flavorful. I found it to be a bit bland, even with the garlic and onion powder added.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I made it as listed with the exception of leaving out the green pepper (didn't have any) and adding a bit more cheese.  It was easy, flavorful and would be great for breakfast, lunch, dinner and for company!
