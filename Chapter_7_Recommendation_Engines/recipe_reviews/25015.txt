This recipe is very dense and creamy, but pretty awesome. You do have to love peanut butter. I particularly like the frosting, and will be using it in other recipes as well. Thanks!

Followed recipe exactly and I got a greasy, hardly cooked, flat pan of batter. While making this recipe, I'm wondering why they are even called brownies.  There is no chocolate other than the chocolate chips you sprinkle on top.  Not even the topping was that great.  Won't be making again.

I'm not sure what went wrong but I had to bake the brownie part a really, really long time to get it to set up in the center. The edges got really done and it made for a funky shaped dessert.  It tasted pretty good, but I think I like a little more chocolate with my peanut butter.  I'll probably make a custom version of this, it definitly has potential.

I don't think I could have loved this more! It was like a party in heaven in my mouth haha. I wasn't too sure about having just the peanut butter brownie, so I layered it with a chocolate brownie (I really liked this one: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Katrinas-Best-Ever-Chocolate-Brownies/Detail.aspx) and layered them both in two pans. The cook time that worked for me was around 25 minutes at 335 degrees. The peanut butter layer was more the texture of a soft cookie but it worked wonderfully. After it was done I added the toppings of this recipe as called for. If you love peanut butter and chocolate, I have no doubt you will love this.

I use the peanut butter cream from this recipe in combination with my own brownies but trust me, the peanut butter mixture is amazing! Worth 5 stars!

They were ok but I guess I like a lot more chocolate. I drizzled melted choc. chips over topping just to make it a little more chocolately.

It was pretty good, although with a few flaws. This is definitely for peanut butter lovers, but the picture is way off. It really just looks like an ordinary old brownie. Otherwise, however, it was very good. I also put a picture showing what it really looks like. It looks a little...unappetizing but it tastes better than it looks.

Made it without frosting, still tasted great when I added extra chocolate chips and cocoa powder on top after it was baked. Perfect for peanut-chocolate loving dads!
