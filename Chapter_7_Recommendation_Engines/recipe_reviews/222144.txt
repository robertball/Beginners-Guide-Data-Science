After adding an extra 1/2 cup milk, these were truly delightful, healthy crepes!
The original recipe makes a batter that's too dense.

(A side thought: "Whole Wheat Crepes" would have been a much better recipe title.)

I forgot the butter altogether, used skim milk, otherwise used the recipe exactly as stated and they turned out beautiful and quick.  I got 7 crepes and a mini crepe out of this recipe

Used 2% milk, regular whole wheat flour, no butter, and put the yogurt into the batter. A bit of flour clumps, but overall a solid recipe.

It's a good basic recipe to use, I added a tsp good vanilla, 2 tbsp of cane sugar and some dried lemon zest to add flavor since I don't like syrup.  Tastes great with fresh fruit.  It really does make 8 crepes exactly.  My daughters enjoyed them too.

I'm actually surprised that it turned out to be tasty even without the fillings and syrup.

I used butter flavoring instead of butter,I also used whole wheat flour and SF syrup. They didn't exactly taste sweet I don't know how  sweet they should taste but it was a great recipe and they were definitely crepes! Next time I will add a packet of stevia.
