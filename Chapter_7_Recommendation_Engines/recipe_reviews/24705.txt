Awesome!!!....and so simple.  Be sure to only "warm" the bananas in the sauce, otherwise bananas wil be too mushy.

Incredible! I made this for friends and they raved about it! One friend said this was the best dessert she has had in her life! I used rum extract in place of rum. I looked up the substitution on the web and found out 1 Tbsp. Rum = 1 tsp. rum extract plus 2 tsp. water. I used these measurements and it tasted perfect!

I've made this twice now, first time used rum flavoring and 2nd time used Meyer's Dark Rum. I thought it was a little too liquid using 3-1/2 T of rum, but my family loved it just as it was. It served our family of 3 generously. The flavor is rich and addictive.

Made this dessert for 36 people and got rave reviews. Instead of using rum, used rum extract
(1/8 tsp. with enough water to make 1 tablespoon).
Scooped ice cream into 36 plastic tumblers, put them on a cookie sheet and put them back in the freezer early in the day.  Served the bananas fosster in a chafing dish and let my guests help themselves.  Could not have been easier!

This was very tasty. I skipped the rum and walnuts and only had light brown sugar. I also combined it with another dessert since some people (like my husband) aren't big on bananas. It's called crunchy ice cream and isn't on this website. You need 4 scoops of vanilla ice cream, honey, cinnamon sugar and about 2 cups of crushed corn flakes. Drizzle honey and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over each scoop. Then cover each scoop with the corn flakes. Place bananas foster around the ice cream and enjoy!.. I know we do!!!

Good and impressive!  I thought you were supposed to light the rum on fire though??? This way the alchol burns off and even the kids can eat this dessert :)

I've been using this recipe for about 8 months as a nice dessert after dinner.  All of my guests absolutely love this! Great recipe! As an extra I add 5ml of banana liquer, it really brings out the rum and bananas.

Wow, this could not be easier to make!  It is also delicious.  I eliminate the walnuts for serveral reasons.  First, I do not believe that Banana Foster typically includes walnuts, and secondly we just prefer a smooth texture.  I have also made this with brandy as well and then flambe the desert, dramatic!  Use dark rum, it adds a little more flavor.

Oh my goodness...this was really good!!  Hubby brougt home some Breyer's extra creamy vanilla ice cream after work, so I whipped this up to serve on top.  I cut my bananas in half and then split them lengthwise...I'm sure it doesn't matter how you slice them..they will all taste the same.  I also used regular brown sugar since I didn't have the dark and it came out great.  Will definitleyl make again.  Thanks Buttermebread.

Made this recipe for myself and my parents...I would recommend twice the amount of walnuts and to make sure the sugar actually dissolves, otherwise instead of a caramel-type sauce, it's grainy. It's a very sweet recipe, reducing the amount of sugar may help as well. Using bananas that aren't fully ripe adds a touch of acidity that was very welcome in this sugary dish.

Absolutely amazing!  I too cut down the amount of sugar quite drastically to about 1/3 to 1/2 of what was called.  I made the sauce without rum, so I added water instead and just cooked it a little longer to thicken it up.  I also cut up my bananas so they were bite size... WOW!  Ice cream never tasted so good.  I will certainly be making this again!

So easy yet so fantastic! I used rum extract as I didn't have any rum on hand. I only added a tbsp of extract because I didn't want a fake rum taste to it. I made one other little change and that was to use pecans instead as I am not a big walnut fan. I made this twice and the only suggestion I have is that if you're going to go to the trouble of making this sauce, buy good quality ice cream. The first time I made it, I used just regular, inexpensive ice cream and it was great. The second time I made it, I used premium ice cream and it was out of this world.

Simple and delicious.  I actually let mine bubble for quite a while to thicken in up a little more.  The next time I make this, I think I'll reduce the rum for a little while, and THEN add the butter.  I also used spiced rum, and that gave it a nice kick.  I doubled the recipe so I think we'll have it with pancakes tomorrow.  I tored it by separating the bananas and the liquid so the bananas wouldn't get mushy.  They'll be SO good over pancakes, and after boiling it for a few minutes, the rum mix is thick enough to use as syrup. Yum!  This might be my new favorite pancake syrup.

This was a really delicious and EASY dessert to have after dinner. Took under 10 min to make this.
I did not use walnuts and instead used chopped pecans. I did not have any rum on hand so I left that out. *TIP* If you decide to make this without the rum it is important to still use 3 1/2 tablespoons of some OTHER liquid (rum extract+water, banana liqueur or banana extract, water, etc.).
If you remove almost 1/4 cup of liquid, and do not add something in its place, you wont end up with a caramel sauce. You will end up with a pan of separated blobs of melted brown sugar, swimming in a pool of melted butter... If you add that on top of ice cream, the molten blobs will instantly seize - and eating these blobs would be equivalent to eating brown sugar taffy (not appetizing in my opinion - and will get glued to your teeth).

I wish I could give this one more than 5 stars--it was SO easy to prepare and the result was nothing short of fabulous! I omitted the walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T". My family can't wait for me to make this again!

I'm not a desert person, but when I came upon this recipe I decided to give it a try cause it sounded good. I was very very impressed! The big plusses w/this recipe are that it is easy to make, and it is absolutely delicious. I didn't change anything except add a touch more rum. The combo of bananas in the cinnamon-brown sugar syrup and the icecream is fabulous.

This has become a family favorite but we've never had it on ice cream!  I slice the bananas crosswise instead of lengthwise and we eat it over pancakes for a special weekend breakfast.

Are you kidding me?? You know a dessert is good when you serve it to your family and they take a bite and give you a speech-less wide eyed look (like they can't believe you made it yourself). This dessert rocks! I omitted the rum and substituted pecans instead of walnuts. I served over warm crescent rolls. It's like something you would taste in an upscale restaurant. Yeah! My husband was amazed.

I don't particularly like bananas...and this was INCREDIBLE!!  I also made steamed buns stuffed with the bananas and served over ice cream with the extra sauce drizzled hot over the top.  Fantastic!

Excellent! I made it for my sons birthday, using only butter, brwn sugar & cinnamon and it came out excellent. I served it over vanilla ice cream on a piece of pound cake came home w/no lft ovrs. I do recommend that you use apple banana if availabe, it doesnt get mushy, and it balances out the sweetness with its tartness.

I can't believe how delicious this recipe is! It literally took me 10 minutes to make this desert and everyone was very impressed. I served these inside of crepes with some whipped cream on top and they were DEVOURED! This is better than any banana's foster I've had at any restaurant. I used some name-brand rum, I almost got no name, but I'm glad I got the name-brand, you can taste the rum, but not in an unpleasant way. It adds a depth of flavor.

This was good for a 5-minute recipe. We didn't have any ice cream on hand, and I have to say it lacked a little on its own. Definitely on the sweet side, but a time-saver.

This was really tasty! My husband and I found it too sugary the first time I made it so I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar the next time I prepared this. It was much better the second time. Also, I cut the bananas into rounds to make it easier to eat, which is important because you have to eat it fast before the ice cream melts.

This has always been one of my favorite "up my sleeve" recipes when I'm in a bind for a quick dessert that needs to impress.  I serve it over icecream in wine glasses.  The only thing I do differently is after I cook it over the stove for a few minutes,  I add the bananas and pour it into a baking dish and put it under the broiler to give it a nice browning.  Then add a dollop of whipped cream too!  It tastes like it took forever, but goes together in a flash!

Just make sure to stir a the sugar mixture until smooth before putting bananas in.

We skipped the walnuts (one guest had allergies) and it was still exceptional. You could have heard a pin drop during dessert. A big plus was using homemade rhum from St. Maarten (that had bananas soaking in it). I don't think it would have been as good with plain light rum.

OH MY Amazing!  We LOVE this recipe and it is SO easy!!  My husband is very particular about what he considers 5 stars, and he thinks this is better than any version he's had in any restaurant.  We use Kilo Kai Rum, which is so good you could do shots all on its own (though we don't.)  Didn't have any dark brown sugar, so we substitute with light brown sugar.   Beware - this desert can be addictive.

This was a hit! My husband and I served this to his parents this evening, and we all wanted more! I would recommend keeping the sugar mixture at a low boil for around 2 minutes before adding the bananas. Had I added the bananas as soon as the mixture began to bubble (as called for in the directions), I think the sauce would have been gritty from the sugar.

I made this for a group of 10 people. It only took a few minutes and everyone was scraping their bowls they enjoyed it so much. I made it the next night for a different group and they loved it, too. VERY VERY easy and VERY good.

I watched a cooking show on television, & saw Bananas Foster prepared.  I thought that I would try it myself.  I went into the allrecipes website, and found this delicious recipe.  It was so easy to make.  We were having friends over for dinner, and as I told them, they were my guinea pigs.  They loved it!  I will definitely make this one again!

Definitely an excellent recipe.

However, I browned a flour tortilla and used a bit of butter and cinnamon to flavor them.
Then, I cut back to two bananas. Three seemed a lot. 
Plus, I decided to put some caramel syrup on top of the bananas foster once it was finished.

It was absolutely delicious, however, the caramel really added to it and the tortilla was definitely a nice way to balance out the richness of the banana foster.

Very easy and delicious.  I've made a similar version before and it always turned sugary--this one didn't.  Ice cream is a must, but leave off the nuts.

Love this recipe.  Great as is, but if you don't have any rum or rum extract on hand you can just add in some extra vanilla.  The taste isn't that much different-- just a little sweeter.  (I actually prefer it with just the vanilla.)

Everyone loved this.  I paired it with homemade pineapple ice cream and shredded coconut, but this is what made the dessert so incredible.  I didn't have any rum on hand and it tasted fine without.  I also prepped it the night before and reheated on low on the stovetop and it was fine.

I've made this a couple times, each time differently.  The first time, we had it as per the directions, and with ice cream.  The second time, I used chopped bananas and rolled the bananas foster in fresh homemade crepes and served warm with ice cream.  Both were yummy!

Wow, this was amazing!  My husband turned up his nose at first watching me make it, saying "what are you making?  Have you had that before?"  But when we tasted it, it was absolutely heavenly.  I added about 1 tblsp lemon juice and cut the Meyer's Dark Rum back to 2 tblsp per another reviewer.  I don't even like bananas very much but this was wonderful.  I also saved the leftovers (there barely were any between 2 of us although we ate way too much) and cooked them in a mini muffin pan lined with lite crescent roll dough for about 11 minutes on 350 (per crescent roll instructions - spray the pan with cooking spray first).  Wonderful and easy, with a good "wow" factor!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Very strong rum flavor.  Next time I will use light brown sugar and omit the rum.

My husband loves Bananas Foster, so he asked me to make it.  He loves the recipe so much that he's willing to be the one to make it.  We follow the directions exactly and use vanilla ice cream.

I made this for Father's day and received rave reviews!  I printed off the recipe and scaled for eight servings.  In my rush to get this made and served I only added 1/4 cup brown sugar (should have been 1- 1/4 cups!, I missed the "1" in front, and it was still terrific and had plenty of sauce for eight glasses.  So I can safely say you can cut down the sugar if you like! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and served in martini glasses with whipped cream and a cherry. Very impressive presentation and easy!

In a word, WOW!  This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.  It tasted just like the bananas foster my husband and I had at a 5 star restaurant. I thought about trying to Flambe it but decided not too and it was just as good with out it. Oh...I did add a dash of banana liquer, but I don't know if that really made it any better.  A tip for all of you that were worried about the ice cream melting so quickly, it's bananas foster!  It's supposed too :)  Thanks for an AWESOME and SIMPLE and QUICK desert recipe!

My family wanted to give this ten stars. Great
recipe and it just doesn't get any easier. I 
measured everything before dinner and simply
prepared it after we finished eating so it would be hot. It couldn't have been better!

A wonderful recipe with phenomenal results!  I added more rum and let the bananas soak in it for some time before cooking.  We then drizzled the finished concoction over vanilla bean ice cream.  It was divine!

Terrific! This is a great recipe that is so simple and quick. My dinner guests loved it, they were so impressed. A keeper, for sure. Just make sure your bananas are ripe, one of my bananas was a tad green and you could tell.

This only gets 2 stars because my husband liked it.  Even with the reduced sugar content and making sure my sugar dissolved, my 'sauce' came out like chunky shards of sugar with a little liquid.  I will keep looking for a better sauce recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!! I made some changes: 1. Added a tablespoon of nutmeg 2. Of course I put much more cinnamon than the recipe called for b/c I love cinnammon 3. Instead of using dark brown sugar I used Panela (which is unrefined sugar that you can buy at Latin grocery stores usually in the shape of a cone or brick) 4. I used Malibu Rum b/c I felt a tropical rum would compliment the bananas. Not sure if I would use walnuts again- b/c they kind of get in the way. Meaning, you want to taste the rum, the ingredients, the sweetness of the banana but when walnuts get stuck around your teeth as you chew with their strong flavor, it takes the wonderful experience away. The banana was SO sweet and the rum was not offensive at all (didn't taste like alcohol whatsoever). I will definitely be making this again. I was excited that I didn't have to flambe in this recipe b/c I've never flambeed anything

Really quick and easy! Impressive enough for company too! Followed the recipe to the letter (which is rare for me) and it was a very yummy dessert for my DD and to share over vanilla ice cream last night after dinner. Subbing out pecans would be delicious too. My only change for next time would be to use a dark or spiced rum (which I didn't have this time), as I think the flavor it would impart would bump this up a star for me. Yum, yum!

Oh my goodness this is a great recipe.  I did however tweak it a little.  (No Rum - Nut free guests)  I cooked the butter and sugar then added the bananas (actually 2 large ones) and skipped the vanilla.  At the end when the bananas were cooked I sprinkled the cinnamon over the mix then plated the crepes I used them in.  Amazing flavor and texture ... so much better than fresh bananas.  I would use this sauce to cover fresh bananas though ... it is that good.  (Cinnamon can burn out on the stove and taste funny ... thus the sprinkling later!)  A go to flavor and taste for later baking adventures.  :)

This was outstanding.  I used 2 tsp of rum extract and 3 tsp of water as a substitute for the rum.  I also used 4 banana's.  It was gone in a flash and they were licking their bowls.  Thank you.

These were good.  The recipe made a lot of sauce and there was too much alcohol for my taste.

Delicious! I had an almond theme going for dinner so I used chopped almonds instead of chopped walnuts. And instead of rum I used the almond based amaretto. Excellent recipe. 

For dinner I had the almond crusted tilapia and the green beans almandine off of allrecipes.com

Great flavor! Followed the recipe, except used the rum extract measurements provided by another person (1 tsp rum extract : 2 tsp water).  Substituted pecans for walnuts. I would recommend to put the Bananas Foster into the servings bowls first, then add the ice cream. We did the opposite and ended up with a soupy concoction--albeit delicious!

This is one of the tastiest desserts I have ever tried!  I found the ingredients to be a perfect mix.  I added one more banana because I had 5 people to serve, and it worked out just right.  My guests mmmm'd and awwww'd through the whole eating of the dessert!  They asked me if they could have the recipe so I wrote it out for them.  Then I raved about it on my facebook page and ended up sending it to a few more friends, along with a link to this website.  lol  This is definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing Buttermebread!

I gave it four stars since the sauce was so good.  It was VERY sweet but good.  I used rum extract in place of rum (didn't want to waste alcohol if this didn't turn out).  I love the bananas foster cheesecake from a local restaurant, so I thought this would be a big hit.  Not for me.  I am not a banana lover and felt the consistency of the warm bananas was off.  I think I may have left them in the hot skillet a little too long.  They were still in tact but the inside was mushy.  I am planning to try this again but take the bananas out after about a minute.

This is heaven in a bowl!  I found the recipe when looking for something to make with some bananas before they went bad.  I can not believe how good it is!  I followed the recipe exactly, minus the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand, and I wont change a thing next time I make it.  My bananas were really ripe and did not turn to mush like someone else said.  It was perfect!

If you throw cinnamon at the pan while the bananas are flaming, you can get the flames to change colors!  Makes for a great effect!

SO good and SO quick and easy!!! I subbed 1TB frangelico for part of the rum (used Cap. Morgan's) and it was awesome. Instead of adding nuts and using vanilla ice cream I did butter pecan ice cream and spooned some of the warm sauce over it all. It made too much sauce to serve it all, but you really need that much to cook them in, so I saved it to reheat and have over ice cream at a later date. Will definately make this again and often.

This was just AMAZING!  I was a little thrown off by the fact that you don't set the whole thing on fire, but decided to try it anyway.  I needed a quick dessert I could serve to my father's business associates, and this fit the bill.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter to cut the calories, and none of our guests liked walnuts, so I left those out as well.  I served it with a generous heaping of *good* vanilla ice cream (using a cheap brand really diminishes the dish), and everyone loved it.  

I tried this again a few weeks later over French toast, and my husband couldn't get enough of it.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks!!!

Great recipe!  I put the rum in the skillet, caught it on fire with a match and blew it out after about 35 seconds.  I then added the rest of the ingredients.  I don't think it is too much rum or sugar, maybe I will use light brown sugar next time though. This would be great for 6 servings as the bananas are so sweet, you don't need much per serving of ice cream.  I would recommend 3 scoops French vanilla ice cream and 1 large scoop of bananas on top.  Not much bananas needed for the ice cream ratio though.  It is plenty sweet to get away with this serving amount per person.

Ok yum! This was sooo good! I have never had bananas foster and this was so easy to make, I loved it! I didnt have any nuts or rum (I know thats a big part of this recipe, but I didnt have any and I wanted to make this anyway!) So since I didnt have any rum I just added a little more vanilla and a little water. Still very tasty.

This recipe is one of my favorite desserts to make. It is so quick and simple and also unbelievably delicious. I like to serve it in an over-sized martini glass to make it look fancy.

These are absolutely DELICIOUS! We used spiced rum instead of normal rum for a bit more flavor. They didn't take me more than 10 minutes to make. SO quick and easy. I know I'll be making this recipe time and time and time again.

THE BEST!!  My grandson, who is a dessert connoisseur at age 5, declared this dish "better than brownies and brownies are the best things in the whole world".  High praise indeed!  I followed the directions to the letter and it was perfect.

this was incredibly good! I kind of eye-balled all the ingredients, but it turned out excellent.  I put a little too much rum in it, but I think everyone was pretty forgiving ;)

Delicious, easy and fast.  You cannot ask for more.  I made it for brunch.  I did not have rum, so I substituted coffee liquor.  Also I am allergic to nuts so I had to omit the walnuts.  But the recipe came out sooo....YUMMY.  I served it over french toast made with Challah (braided bread).  I also increased the bananas to 4.  My family loved it so much we ate everything, practically licked the plates. Thank you for posting such a GREAT recipe.

I used very ripe plantains, used only 2 1/2 tbp. of rum (didn't want to mess w/ flambe & didn't want too strong a rum flavor) & then added one tbp. of banana liqueur. Srved it over Blue Bell's french vanilla ice cream...YUMMM! Thanks Buttermebread!

This recipe is a winner.  I excluded the rum.  I have made it several times and we've enjoyed it every time.  The last time I made it I used "just purchased" dark brown sugar.  The sugar was so dry that it never melted, but rather got hard and overcooked.  I threw that out and used soft regular brown sugar and it was the great result I had achieved before.  So, make sure your brown sugar is soft, regardless of whether you use regular or dark brown sugar.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

wonderful! I tossed in some extra rum and used pecans instead of walnuts! I sliced the bananas into small pieces rather than serving sliced lengthwise/crosswise and served the ice cream in desset cups, with bananas heaped on top. Also, I made the sauce ahead of time, left out and then heat it all up quickly in the pan. Thanks so much!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  The creaminess of the ice cream cut through the sweetness of the brown sugar sauce.  I used rum extract instead of rum and it turned out fine.

Really easy and really tasty. I would let the sauce cool before serving, that way the ice cream doesn't melt.

So fast and easy!  I mixed the sauce before my guest arrived.  When I was ready to make it...I added it to the butter then finished it with the bananas and nuts...took only 2 minutes.  Impressive and delish!

Very simple, very easy- made this for the 2nd time last night and we all really enjoyed it! Tweaked it a little - cut the serving size to 2 for the sauce but used 2 large bananas and it was PLENTY for the 3 of us, with leftover sauce (the sauce is super rich so you really don't need much). Delicious and so fast to throw together!

Amazing recipe ! I always like to use light brown sugar instead of dark. I doubled this recipe and it turned out beautifully ! Everyone loved it! Will definitely make again. I love the simplicity. (SN: don't forget to flame it for an extra bit of fun for your guests)

This was delicious and simple. I don't care for walnuts so I substituted pecans. Next time I'm going to add an additional banana and a few more pecans since there is plenty of sauce. My new favorite ice cream topping!

Very delicious and quick and easy to make, using light or dark rum. Adding a pinch of salt also helps take some of the sweetness off.

This is so good my husband calls it 'sex in a bowl'! It is so easy to make and quick.  I use the Splenda brown sugar blend and a touch of extra bananas and rum.  Your guests will think you spent hours on the dessert.

Very tasty.  Make sure just to warm the bananas.  Any longer and they are too mushy.

Excellent!  I made it as written except added water in the amount of rum then when cooked/lightly boiling, removed from stove added the rum and flamed.  Very good indeed!

The recipe is a good one, except they forgot to add fresh squeezed lemon juice from half of a lemon.  This really enhances the favors and makes a huge difference. If you think it's good now.....just wait till you try it with lemon juice!

The  entire family loved it!  We are going to try using left overs for French toast tomorrow.  I only had lt brown sugar and vanilla flavored rum on hand, but was still the best ice cream we've ever had.

I made it without the nuts and rum--it's the kids' favorite dessert now! I put the ice cream in martini glasses and leave them in the freezer until ready. When the bananas are done, I scoop them onto a plate and continue cooking the sauce until it caramelizes. Then I put the bananas over the ice cream, followed by the caramel sauce.

Can you believe I never had Bananas Foster before? This was a first and it turned out great. I made this to go with my homemade vanilla ice cream. I followed the recipe as written but left out the rum since I don't keep it on hand.

So simple to make and sooo good.  I did use 1 tsp rum extract and used half butter and half smart balance to make a little lower fat for my father but still tasted so rich.  Also served with Bryer's 1/2 the fat ice cream.  We all loved it.  Will have to indulge in the full fat version in the future.

I made this exactly as directed and it turned out great! I couldn't really taste the rum flavor at all and I did use Meyers dark rum so I might add more next time. It is also possible that I over cooked the syrup. In the future I am going to slice the bananas cross sectionally so there is more sauce per bite. Awesome Recipe!

I'm a dessert aficionado....and I have never tasted ANY dessert more heavenly than this. I was out of rum, so I used Di Saronno Amaretto. OMG!!! I don't even care much for bananas but I will be using this to top MORE than just ice cream! THANK YOU BUTTERMEBREAD!!!!

Easy and Quick! A fun showboat thing to do is light the rum on fire (add a bit more rum, and use a long handled lighter), and then sprinkle the cinnamon into the flames......looks fabulous and so much fun!!

It was pretty tasty but I have tasted before where you can't taste so much  banana. It was still a simple topping for ice cream so that was great.

I made this dessert for the first time & it was the first time I have had Bananas Foster. It's my new favorite dessert. My husband and step-son loved it as well. However, I believe next time I'll omit the cinnamon, it was a little overpowering for all of us. I also did not add the rum as I thought my 13 year old step-son would not like it. Overall, great recipe, will make a few adjustments to suit our personal tastes.

I used light brown sugar because that's all I had on hand, and used only 2 Tbsp of butter to reduce the fat content a bit.  Per other reviews, I did not cook the bananas long, leaving them in the pan only until they were warmed up to prevent mushy bananas.  It was wonderful!

This is super delicious!! The only thing I didn't like, was that my husband scooped out way too much ice cream for me to pour it over. It ended up being a huge soup bowl. But the bananas foster itself was soooooo good! Next time I will only add one small cup or half a cup of ice cream.

Absolutely delicious!  Very few ingredients and easy to make.  In place of the rum, I used a banana rum which added a little extra flavor to the sauce.

I made it twice, and no one ate it except me; 1 out of 7 people.  They didn't like the flavor.  I didn't either.  I didn't care for the warm bananas.  Quick to make, but does not beat chocolate topping.  I won't be making this again.

This was simply amazing. My best friend asked for this instead of a birthday cake. The first time her nephew came to the house and made his version, a few nights later, the last night of her and her family's visit, I made this version....OUTSTANDING!!...far superior to the nephew's version (sorry macky) LOL!!

I didn't have any ice cream on hand so I made the bananas and threw some granola on top. DELICIOUS! Good idea if you're trying to avoid dairy. Or if you just don't have vanilla ice cream in the house!

This was great! Definately too much for 2 people though. Kept the walnuts but didn't chop them up. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I will be making this again on Sat for my sister. It looks really fancy but is super simple. Thanks for the recipe!

Favourite dessert ever!!  Love how easy it is to make and it tastes GREAT with vanilla ice cream.  Simple enough to make while tipsy (no measurements, of course) and it's ready to eat in less than 5 minutes, too.

Awesome!  We substituted one pear for one of the bananas (you have to cook to soften and remove before you start the butter/brown sugar).  Also topped with whipped cream.  Mmmmm!

Used two large bananas and sliced them on an angle at varying thicknesses. I used a bit more butter towards the end to give it another gloss. Excellent recipe.

A great recipe that I decided to try on the grill!  I put a skillet on the grill to make the sauce. I brushed the bananas with honey and put them on the grill for 2-3 minute each side. I finished the bananas in the skillet with the sauce for 3-4 minutes.  Everything over ice cream. Rave reviews from the family!

Took less than 10 minutes. Truly wonderful. Thanks. A $1 mini bottle of rum from the liquor store worked out great. It was the only ingredient I didn't have on hand.

Used Coke Light instead of rum!  I didn't have rum or rum extract or any other suitable alcohol, so my eyes lit upon the Coke.  It sizzled up nicely and added a nice undertone.  (I'm not a big fan of alcohol on desserts anyway.)  I only had macademias, but they were a nice touch, and I must say I'm unconcerned if nuts are not original to the recipe or not. I love nuts, and sometimes change is good.  I served over chocolate chip ice cream.  Yum!

This sounded so interesting, I gave it a try even though I had some reservations, ...I expected the cooked bananas to bring up a gag reflex, cause usually I can't eat even slightly soft bananas...but this is such a great, fast, easy way to use up overripe bananas, when you're just sick of banana bread. I used this recipe as a guide, but seriously lightened it up. I used about 1/2 TB of butter, I packed TB of brown sugar, 2 bananas, 1 ts vanilla. No cinnamon, walnuts, or rum. I really want to try it with the rum. This is so great with so many things...I know I wouldn't like it with ice cream cause I dislike ice cream( I know I'm weird) but with plain yogurt...yum! It's actually great with bread, and I'm sure pancakes too...it was amazing with my oatmeal. I actually cooked it on high for a good 3-5 mins so the sugars could caramelize...and after taking the bananas out, I swirled the hot pan with water to get all the sugar left over, and pured that over as a syrup on the bananas. I'm sure it must be mind-boggling delicious the original way, but I was making this for breakfast and wanted it lighter. Can't imagine adding anymore sugar or butter...perfect the way I made it:) 2out of 3 family members liked...one refused to touch it after seeing it was cooked bananas...still consider that a success.

This is such an easy, tasty recipe! I made this for four kids and four adults and the recipe was just fine. The "sauce" part made plenty, I just added more bananas as we needed them. I skipped the nuts and only used about 1 1/2 Tab. of Malibu Coconut Rum, still turned out perfect.

The sauce for this recipe was amazing. I would recoment not putting the bananas in the sauce wile you are cooking it. it said to cook for one to two minutes. When you cook the bananas it makes them very stringy. I think that it would be much better if you pour the sauce over top of the bananas,and them added the ice cream. It would make the bananas alot less stringy, and make them have a better texture. This is a very an awsome recipie and i will make it again soon.

Great taste. Just as I remembered. I would suggest cooking the bananas a little longer. Maybe about 5 mins.

Love it love it love it! I used tatoo rum by captain morgans and a squeeze of lime for an extra kick. I served it all with a jamaican rum spice cake and it was delicious. Great recipe.

Made it for my family. I had some ripe bananas that had to be used up. I added some nutmeg and it went very well with some apple fritters. Though my sister did find that there was a slight bitter taste from the alcohol, maybe I'll put less for her next time.

My mother has been craving this, so I made it for Mother's Day Brunch, to serve with Challah French Toast. I've been looking for a recipe that I don't have to "ignite", because I didn't want to light the house on fire. I doubled the recipe, but didn't double the rum--since this was a breakfast dish. Everyone loved it and it's long gone. Thank You!

Delicious! Can't taste the rum really once it's cooked but it was great! I didn't have any ice cream on hand so I served it with some sifted icing sugar and shaved chocolate! It was a hit. The only problem was that my banana halves didn't want to stay in one piece!

This has got to be the best bananas foster recipe EVER!  It's better than ANY restaurant that I've ever had it in. Everyone I've made it for (and we make it often) has said it is just to die for.  It's so quick and so easy anyone can make it easily!!  We don't use the nuts just because I don't like them.

OMG!!!  This is the best thing I think I've ever eaten.  It was so gooey and delicious.  I didn't have rum so I omitted it.  I also forgot the cinnamon but it wasn't missed.  Super good even without ice cream.  Great recipe to use up those browning bananas.

This recipe was sooo easy and practically fullproof. Tastes just like something from a restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly but I used Captian Morgan's Spiced Rum because it was what I had on hand. Perfect! : )

OMG!!!  Delicious!  I can't wait to make this again.  So easy, and fast.  I was going to make fried plantains last night, but my supper guest mentioned Bananas Foster.  I just so happened to have ice cream, and all of the ingredients, which weren't many!  I'd never eaten it, seen it, or of course made it.  I came to this site for a recipe, and here was HEAVEN!!!!  LOVED IT!!!!!  Thank you so much!

Five big ol' sparkly, diamond-encrusted stars for this one!!!  So, so good.  Made it for company last night, and my husband begged for more tonight, so I just halved the recipe and it was just as good.  My new favorite dessert undoubtedly.  Thank you!

This was so easy and very delicious! Its one of those desserts that will fool others in thinking you spent lots of time making it! I think this is one of the best recipes to make if you have extra bananas. I tried adding some banana rum I had on hand and it turned out just as great. Enjoy!

I had bananas foster once before, years ago, and have been looking for a good recipe ever since.  This one is it!  Very easy and turned out just wonderful.  I will cut down a little on the brown sugar next time, the family said it was a little too sweeet for them.  Very easy, tasty and elegant.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Over all, this was pretty good. I served this over vanilla bean ice vream and it was well received. It did, however, melt the ice cream very quickly.

Quick and easy to make and tasty on French Toast for breakfast.  I think next time I would ease up on the rum a bit. We only had a dark rum, maybe that was the thing? Still, all and all, pretty yummy.

Edits that I made, but you don't have to: I doubled the vanilla, I used light brown sugar, I used 4 ounces of very expensive wheated Kentucky bourbon whiskey,  I allowed the mixture to bubble for 6 to 7 minutes instead of just a few (stirring frequently), and I allowed the bananas to remain in the skillet (turning a few times to coat) for 4 to 5 minutes. This was an amazing dish. I highly recommend it!

Delicious and oh so simple.  Made as written, except reduced the sugar by about half and didn’t add the nuts. Elegant dessert to make with short notice! Thank you!

I have used this recipe many times, with great success. I usually leave out the walnuts, just because I don’t have them, but if I have them, I add them. I think it’s a great recipe, and I couldn’t believe how easy it was to make bananas foster! I usually serve it over French toast, but you can put it on anything that suits your fancy. I’ve gotten compliments every time I serve it.

A very old fashioned New Orleans Treasure. I made it exactly as the recipe says. Perfect.  Now for some changes, instead of rum ues strawberry Kool-Aid so the kids can eat it instead of chocolate ice cream, instead of bananas use cucumber for a less starchy substitution, and use rice wine vinegar so the diabetic aunt won't be left out. It'll taste awful, but hey.

I halved the brown sugar (to 1/3 cup) and it was still exceedingly sweet (though we tend to eat smaller amounts of sugar than average people). Otherwise, VERY GOOD. Banana liqueur would definitely add to this, but it's not necessary.

The recipe called for way too much sugar.   I cut back the sugar in half and it was still sweet.   Bananas are already sweet so I don't think much sugar is needed.

OH MY...This was fabulous! I didn't use this as dessert...instead I made it for breakfast and used it to top some wonderful cream cheese stuffed toast with the vanilla ice cream and some powdered sugar.  It was beautiful and was gobbled up by the family in mere minutes.  The recipe for the cream cheese stuffed toast was not from this site, but I encourage trying it this way.  You will not be disappointed!!

Let me just say that bananas foster is one of my favorite desserts and this recipe is Absolutely divine! I'd give it 10 stars If I could. I prepared just as recipe said, using a Jamaican dark rum and Yum. My husband and I gobbled it up. I will definitely be making this again perhaps using the sauce over some French toast.

This is a fabulous recipe! The rum cooked out perfectly. My husband would have like a thinner sauce, but I thought it was perfect. I will try it with pecans next time! Absolutely delicious! Make sure your bananas are on the greener side. It will help them to stay firm.

Yummy! 
Made it dairy free with earth balance soy free butter instead didnt have any vanilla extract so I used less of almond extract and instead of rum used amaredo. And was able to make 5 bananas out of it with, but everyone loved it! definitely will make again!

LOVED IT, will certainly do again, but very rich and not something we will eat often, but for a treat really good.

The alcohol did not burn down enough and it was like a shot of rum in every bite. Next time I'll use the less expensive rum and let it boil down a little more.

I gave this a 5 star review because my husband and son just loved it and devoured it.  For my taste, I found it a bit too sweet and sent me running for a large glass of water.  
I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was really good, just really sweet.  I will make again because the boys loved it so much but I think next time I will try it with crepes or pancakes and use it as a syrup.

My entire family enjoyed this dessert. I ended up substituting roasted almonds for the walnuts, since none of us are keen on walnuts. I would say that a good quality ice cream really helps.

Great quick recipe...just lovely!! I decided to skip the walnuts, use less butter and served over butter pecan ice cream and topped it with a handful of semisweet chocolate morsels... Each spoonful was mouth-watering decadent bliss... Highly recommend!!

Absolutely yummy! I took another reviewers advice on how to use rum extract (since we don't drink, we don't have real rum handy). Perfect!

This is a delicious recipe. You definately need the vanilla ice cream because it is so rich but it is sooo worth it.  I will definately be making this recipe again. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had Pineapple rum(tropical, eh?) and it was wonderful. Thanks for a wonderful, easy, inexpensive recipe.

This is my favorite recipe for guests. I can make it quickly after dinner and everyone enjoys watching it made. I use light brown sugar, unsalted butter, dark rum and a little banana liqueur. Sometime I will add some finely chopped roasted pecans. This dessert never fails to satisfy even the pickiest dessert person

This was really good. We used banana rum instead of regular/dark rum, skipped the walnuts, and added a flambe of Grand Marnier at the end. We cooked the bananas in the mixture for about 5 minutes so they could get a little candied. The key is to use green bananas - they are a little tougher since they aren't yet ripe, and they don't turn to mush.

Fabulous! When I made this dish I sliced the bananas short way so it was easy to eat with the ice cream. For the rum I simply got one of those one shot bottles at the liquor counter. It was the exact amount needed for the recipe :)

OMG!! This really takes me back. My husband and I had this in a little restaurant on our first date 10 yrs. ago and we thought that it was amazing. So this looked to be a pretty good comparison to try at home and we were right! It is FABULOUS! We have made this 3 times and the only advice I would give is to wait a few minutes to pour the mixture over your ice cream. Otherwise it melts all of your ice cream and turns it into a delectable liquid. So if you don't mind the liquid version, pour it over immediately, if not wait a few mins. By the way a little more rum doesn't hurt.  Thanks for sharing! Enjoy!

Good, but not the best Bananas Foster I've ever had. We used pecans instead of walnuts. It was a bit dry.

Wonderful and so easy to make!  My 14 year old did it.  I had eaten at Brennan's in New Orleans so the only modification I added was 1/4 cup of Banana Liqueur.

Don't change a thing on this recipe.  It is perfect the way it is.  It doesn't get too thin like some fosters recipes can be; I've tried many recipes for banana's foster and this one is tops.  Just make sure you cook the brown sugar long enough to take the grittiness out.

Totally delicious! I took this to a church event in a crock pot. Because of this, I cooked the sauce in the pot longer and then added the bananas just a few minutes before I headed out. Everyone raved about it.

This was awesome.  When you put it over pancakes, it's the closest you'll get to a Pecan Cinnabon you can get!  My only changes are add a little water to thin it out and the bananas probably only need 30 seconds on the burner or they get very soft.  Awesome

Great flavor!  I reduced the recipe to 2 for my husband and I and used 1 banana.  There was a little too much goop for us (too sweet), but we'll be making this again with less sugar on top of our ice cream.

Very good! And very very simple! I didn't add the nuts because of an allergy and it was still delious! This took longer to gather the ingredents then it took to acually make it! I served it with vannila frozen yogurt. My bofriend ( the advid hater of bananas foster) has asked me to make this many of times!

Very tasty. I omitted the nuts since I didn't have any on-hand.  It would have added a nice texture contrast, though, so hopefully I have some next time.

My family and I adore this recipe. It's turning into a Sunday night tradition. I was leary of the walnuts, but they add a wonderful texture. I am under orders from the family not to make a single adjustment to the recipe.

Overall I had to say that this dessert was good, but not great.  The sauce is delicious and the presentation even looks good, but you don't get a taste explosion in every single bite.  It's pretty easy to make and I'll definitely try it again, but it wasn't good enough to get all five stars.

This was FANTASTIC, and SO quick and EASY! We didn't use the walnuts, as we aren't nut people and I don't think they're usually in bananas foster, but otherwise this recipe is great, and so elegant for guests, too! Use good quality darker rum like Appleton Estate, not silver/white rum, for the best flavor. And I think we increased the cinnamon to our taste.

Really good, and super easy. I forgot the walnuts entirely (left them right on the counter!) and it was still delicious. Have made this in pie form before from another recipe--these bananas on the precooked crust, then instant vanilla pudding & cool whip on top. This way was less work & just as tasty :-)

Thank you!  This was great.  I had an urge for something sweet, and this hit the spot.  I didn't have vanilla extract on hand, so i used the same amount of maple syrup and it came out great.  I'll have to pick up some vanilla extract for when i make this again.

WOW! This is so yummy :) The best part is that it is SUPER easy to make; with prep and everything it took me about 8 minutes and the results were fabulous!! The only substitution I made was using pecans instead of walnuts. And I cut the bananas in to slices (diagonally for larger slices) so that it would be easier to eat.   I made this to go along with the banana foster pudding also from this site. The results were superb *BUT* I wouldn't do both again. Both desserts were good enough to stand alone and the results would have been just as impressive (and much cheaper) had I only made one. Definitely give this one a try you won't be disappointed!

Holy COW this stuff is good!  I also used rum extract, as I didn't have any rum, but WOW this is yummy!  I'll definitely be adding this to my dessert repertoire!

made it for my boyfriend and his roommates.  I used rum extract instead of real rum (because I'm lazy and didn't feel like making an extra trip to the liquor store), and not nuts because I like my foster to be smooth.  Very nice taste, great texture.  I'm sure the nuts would have made it taste great as well!

I made this recipe tonight for a family dinner.  It was delicious and everybody said it was great.  We had 7 people and I cute up 6 bananas but 5 would have been enough.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts and used 3 1/2 tsp. of rum extract instead of the rum.  This is something that I will make again and again.  My five year old said it was the best!

This is a great recipe!  It took about 15 mintues from start to finish, so it was great for a dinner party.  Keep in mind that it's rich and nobody was able to consume more than half a banana with sauce, so I had some left over.  I also considered leaving out the nuts, but I'm glad I didn't because one friend specifically commented on how good the nuts were.  So I could have easily served 5 people with the recipe for four, and the nuts are worth it!

Delicious.  I used light instead of dark brown sugar, and added a couple dashes of ground cloves and ground cardamom.  I used Gosling's Black Seal Rum.  I served it was some fresh hot breakfast pastries.  An excellent breakfast!

There was silence at the dinner table when I served these... no one wanted to stop eating, not even to compliment the cook!  I had leftover rum cake, so I served it over that with Dulce de Leche ice cream.  My husband curses my Business degree now, saying I missed my calling to become a chef :-)

I only found this recipe 2 weeks ago and have made it 3 times already. It is quick, easy and very impressive as a dessert. My husband LOVED it and he isn't really crazy about bananas. I used coconut rum and pecans in mine. Simply devine!

Very rich.  Might be a little better with less sugar.  It was okay to try, but i would let te stuff cool a little, i poured it straight on rock hard ice cream and it turned into soup.

WOW!! This was way too easy to taste so good!! I made this after having a late night craving.  I found this recipe and was eating in about 5 minutes! I used some pineapple coconut ice cream and didn't bother with the nuts.  Heaven in a bowl!! I can't wait to make this again.  Only one problem...I don't want to share!!!

WOW, THIS IS AMAZING! I kind of made a "dummy" version of this but it came out delicious anyway. First I scaled it to 1 serving and used a full banana. I followed the recipe except instead of rum (don't have any) I used whipping cream. Then I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts because I had some on hand. It took about 5 minutes to make and it tasted SO GOOD!

Perfectly simple dessert.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and pre-scooped the ice cream in bowls and put them in the freezer before prepping the sauce.  The extra chill helped the ice cream hold up to the warm topping.  I also used spice rum, which compliments the cinnamon.  Delicious, and sure to be made many times in our house.

Loved the texture of the banana once it is cooked. Next time I'll have to use real rum instead of extract.

1 word.....AMAZING!!! This was so suprisingly good and sooo easy, I had eaten this at the Hard Rock Casino and fell in love with this dessert and came on here and found this recipe and decided to give it a try, my hubbi and I both devoured it. I served mine in a waffle cone bowl which added a nice crunch.Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and so easy!  I cut the bananas into round slices instead of cutting them lengthwise.  I spooned them over ice cream, and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

I converted the recipe for a  serving of 4 and i will next time cut down on the rum and brown sugar, it was just a little too much for me, but my husband and 7 year old and 4 year old children liked it as is.

Yum!  I made this for dessert for 5 people (had more than enough even though the recipe says 4) and everyone loved it.  I didn't want the rum flavor to be too strong so I mixed it in with the sugar and ignited it in the pan for about 10 seconds before adding the vanilla, cinnamon and bananas.  Served warm over french vanilla ice cream.

Easy to make and tastes great!  If you are concerned about presentation; this may not be the desert for you - a little sloppy in appearance.  However, it tastes wonderful!!

Oh. My. GOODNESS!!!  Made this for company and had all the ingredients measured out in the pan so it only took a couple of minutes to get it ready when the time came.  Beautiful texture, fabulous taste, and SO easy!

Yummy!! I made a double batch of this and served it for dessert at a dinner party in big wine goblets. The presentation was beautiful and to this day people are still talking about how good it was. I also used pecans instead.

Excellent!  This is an extremely easy recipe to make.  I didn't have any rum in the house, so I used brandy.  I made this for dessert one evening, and had some leftover.  I heated it in the morning and had a it was just as yummy over french toast.  Thanks!

This was really good but had a much different texture than the bananas foster I've had before.  I think its because you normally are supposed to flambé them.  Id rather not do that however because Id probably burn my house down.

It was delicious, but somewhat runny.  Not sure what you could do to thicken it up other than caramalize the sugar by cooking longer.

This is a delicious,  SUPER EASY topping for ice cream. Mine seemed a little thick so I added about 1 Tbs more rum ...perfect! And I agree, Spiced Rum (like Captain Morgan's) is the best for this recipe, but a dark rum would be good too. I would not recommend a light rum, but would do OK in a pinch.

Excellent recipe. I have always felt intimidated by Bananas Foster, but now I make it all the time. I serve it over ice cream or cake. The kids love it and ask for it often. It is also simple because I always have all the ingredients on hand. The kids think it is very novel that they get to eat something with rum in it!

Easy, fast and good. I'd let the mixture cool a little before topping ice cream next time so it's not all melted when I'm only half way through. I'll definitely make again.

Pretty good for a last minute dessert.  The only thing I changed was I added 2 extra bananas which then gave me 6 servings.  This is one I can definitely serve at the next dinner party.

I guess this recipe is good.  I have never had bananas foster before, so I am not a good judge.  It just tasted like bananas over ice cream to me...nothing special, but maybe that is what bananas foster should taste like.  On the plus side, it was extremely easy to make.

Great dessert. Super easy, super fast recipe.  Made this for my boyfriend last night who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth and before he could finish his first serving he was already asking for seconds.  Thank you for this.  I, too enjoyed it very much.

Very good. Very easy. Add only a little of the sauce at a time on your icecream or it will turn to soup!

I made this, start to finish, including retrieving & measuring ingredients, in 5 minutes.  I made 2 bananas, halving the other ingredients...  And I left out the walnuts.  Just didn't have 'em.  Used coconut-rum, and it was one of the better bananas foster recipes i've tried.

I had a dinner party the other night and this was a huge hit!!!  It did not take me away from my guests for very long either.  I was out of the kitchen and enjoying this great dessert with them.  Again, I would highly recommend this sweet treat.

I used this recipe with light brown sugar (because I didn't have any dark) and Kraken Black Rum instead of dark rum. The flavor was very deep and rich, like molasses without all the metallic notes. It melded beautifully with vanilla ice cream. As a matter of personal preference, I would leave out walnuts next time.

Wow! Delicious and easy to make!  None of the ingredients were overpowering-just  the right blend. My bananas were a little too ripe to begin with so next time I’ll use perfect-to-eat bananas. If the sauce appears too thick before adding the bananas don’t worry as the liquid in the bananas makes it the correct consistency.

Awesome!!! I used 151 Proof Rum. That is all I had. I had to be really careful as it is highly flammable. This recipe is as good as you would get in any restaurant.

Ooooooooh my goodness! BETTER  than Perry’s Steakhouse! I used light brown sugar ( I don’t know if you’re supposed to, but I packed it) instead of dark brown. I used 4 Tbs. of rum, which I added last and didn’t cook too long. DELICIOUS!!

OMG this is to die for!  Make it flaming to impress your guests. 1st tell them to get their cameras ready; stand back just a bit, you don't want to burn your long hair or the sleeve of your favorite blouse.  The last ingredient to add is the rum and a little banana liquor is great too. Increase the rum to 1/4 to 1/3 cup and tilt your pan enough to catch the flame. Wola, you have flambe!

I made this for 11 people last night tripling the recipe.  I had pre-measured everything so that when it came time to make it the wait wasn't so long.  My sister cut the bananas while I got the sauce going.  IT WAS SO GOOD!!  Everyone was quiet while eating it and then raved about it!  I am going to make this any chance I get.

The only changes I made were using 4tbs rum instead of 3 1/2 (it was the very end of the bottle and who saves 1/2 tbsp of rum, anyway?? Lol), 2 bananas instead of 3 (all I had on hand, but it was a dessert for only two so that didn't matter), and pecans instead of walnuts (because I prefer them). It came out lovely, buttery and decadent and I saved the leftover sauce to have in a day or two. I'll take pictures next time. I forget to prepare to do that before the food is ready. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this for years.  It is so delicious!  The only thing I do differently is substitute brandy for the rum.  It’s a favorite at my house.  I usually make a double batch and it will all be gone that night or the next day.  Yum!!!

It was good, but I was surprised that nothing tasted like bananas. Other recipes call for banana liquor and this is probably why. The rum sauce is delicious over vanilla ice cream. I also wanted to have a flambé  experience so I added the rum at the end and lit the skillet on fire which was cool!! I’d make it again with the banana liquor as other recipes suggest and I’d try dark rum. I just used regular rum because the grocery store didn’t have dark rum.

This was tasty but reminded me more of french toast with bananas than of Bananas Foster.  Maybe next time I would not add as much cinnamon.

So delicious and easy to make! Even overly ripe bananas work here. I had one of those and just sliced it regular and scaled the recipe down a bit. In place of the rum I used rum extract (less than if using rum). This time, I also added a few shakes of salt, which I liked. Cooks up in a minute or two, as the recipe states. I just have to have this with vanilla ice cream! It's creamy coolness really complements the banana mixture. Just like something you'd get in a fine restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times and love it. I don't make any substitutions, although I don't always add the walnuts if I don't have them or am feeding people who don't like them. I do use real rum and don't burn it off, though I've seen that done in restaurants, and it's really beautiful. I'd probably just start a kitchen fire, though. Cooking burns off the alcohol, too. My favorite way to serve this recipe is over french toast for brunch, and it gets rave reviews!

Made this on the weekend with pecans and had to omit the vanilla (because I ran out) but it was so good.  Used the remaining little bit on pancakes the next morning and I now have a new favorite pancake topper.

Made for friends last night to rave reviews!!!!   Such a easy recipe for such a big pay-off.  Literally took  less than 10 minutes.
Only change was I used the sm. bottles of spiced rum  from the grocery store that sell for a couple of dollars.
Very yummy!

I served this on Belgian waffles, and it was DIVINE. Just on the tasty edge of too sweet--a little of this goes a long way. I subbed one tablespoon of rum for banana liqueur because another reviewer suggested it and I happened to have some on hand. This is so easy and so tasty, I'm sure to make it again and again.

I made this for my wife on her birthday...she's in love with Banana's Foster. This recipe was easier than any I've done before and tastes great! Instead of ice cream, I coupled it with Belgian Waffles and Whip Cream (I made it for brunch)...it was the hit of the morning!  Thank you!

This recipe for basically banana, walnuts, and vanilla ice cream was excellent. 

The bananas used for the recipe were just ripened. Bought the walnuts chopped. a little on the pricey side, but convenient.

Also used softened ice cream for presentation purposes.

Saw this dish on an infomercial and just had to make it. I came across this recipe and the whole family really enjoyed it. Make sure your bananas are a little firm, otherwise they get a little mushy and mess up your presentation.

I've made this more than once. Easy and delicious! We use it over Belgian Waffles on a Saturday morning when we have time for a special breakfast, and too many bananas in the house :)

I really liked this but found that the sugar significantly overpowered the banana and rum flavours. I will try it again with just a couple tablespoons of sugar. I agree that you should invest in some good quality ice cream. We used Madagascar bourbon vanilla - yum!

Delicious! Easy! Super sweet even when using bananas that were not ripe. I wouldn't serve over ice-cream as soon as done cooking, it melted faster then i could eat it. Just let it cool for a few minutes.

made this for 12 people. I cut the recipe in half and still had left overs . everyone liked it. Personally I thought it was too syrupy.  I will make adjustments for next time. It is a good recipe that is easy when making for a large group of people.

Came out awesome. I whipped this up in less than 30 minutes. I doubled the recipe and added only 1/2 a cup.... Ok 1.5-2 cups of rum. Cooked without bananas on high till it bubbled reduced heat to low added bananas then brought to a boil once again. Reduced heat to simmer for about 5 minutes. Added over vanilla ice cream and it was fantastic. Cheers!

Yum - and easy - my 2 favorite things! Made it exactly as written except for using coconut rum (that's what I had - couldn't taste the coconut) and left out the nuts since I was using it over pancakes. It was super easy & amazing. I let the sauce simmer a few minutes before adding the bananas to make sure the alcohol was cooked off. Added whipped cream& sprinkles & it looked like a restaurant meal. It tasted great. Love this!

Oh My Gosh!!! I made this just for me.  One banana,  1 TB brown sugar, 1 TB butter, 1 TB dark rum, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Heated up well, turn off fire,  and quickly stirred in sliced banana.   Put over ice cream and topped with pecans.  WOWOWOWOWOW.   It was enough for 2 servings, and I ate both!!!!

Easy and delicious.  Made on an electric stove top.  Poured in the rum and lit it with long grill starter flame.  It burned nicely.  Don't cook bananas too long as others have stated.

This is a pure Bananas Foster.  I think that the keys to making this dish is to sample your bananas as you cook them.  My bananas were fresh from the store and still somewhat green and took more cooking, ripe bananas would take less time to cook.  Do not be afraid to add more rum as you cook to keep the sauce the right consistency.   It will reduce down.  Use a good dark rum and not some cheap white rum.  I also cut my bananas smaller so that pieces would fit on a spoon with some ice cream without having to cut the bananas in the serving bowl.  If I were presenting this in a banana split bowl, I would only halve the bananas.

Loved it!!!! New favorite! Extremely easy. Slight changes: used 1/2 the butter, followed tip and dissolved sugar well before adding the 3 very ripe bananas. Let bananas cook longer, about 5-7 min. My son said it was THE best compliment to vanilla ice cream he's ever had. Thanks!

This was like a sophisticated ice cream sundae!  I made this with half a cup of brown sugar, half a cup of toasted walnuts, and the full amount of a dark spiced rum.  Served up over vanilla ice cream.  Great dessert while watching the Superbowl

Easy and delicious!  I used a cast iron skillet and boiled the sauce a bit longer to burn some of the alcohol off.  

Even overcooked - with slightly mushy bananas - this was delicious!  Served on top of Waffles with unsweetened whipped cream.  Divine!

I made it without the walnuts and I saute the sauce for several minutes longer than suggested to thicken the sauce and evaporateteh alcohol. Rather than reduce sugar, I simply add more butter to adjust thickness to taste.  I've also added banana liqueur  to thin the sauce if desired. I've topped a plain cheesecake with it adn it's very good.  Lots of likes around the table.

It was fast, easy and came out delicious. I get all kinds of compliments when I serve it to guests - they think I went 'all out'!  A scoop of ice cream on the side is a must.

I had this in Cuba for the first time, where the rum and bananas are plentiful and delish! I recently remembered it and was impressed by how yummy it is! Simple recipe, almost always have the ingredients on hand. I should note, the last bananas on the pan were a bit mushy and the sauce thickened into a candy-ish sauce, so when the bananas are warm, take everything off the heat.

Awesome and easy to make! I used Bacardi Oakheart spiced rum since it was what I had,  and it was very good. Somebody mentioned lighting on fire so you can serve to kids... The rum I used was 70 proof, the same proof as kirkland vanilla. Cooking for 2 minutes will cook out almost all, if not all of the alcohol.

Reduced the butter to 3 tbs and sugar to a half cup. Added 4 tbs of rum and this recipe came out great! Was worried with the original amounts that it would be like putting sugar and butter on ice cream. With the alterations the taste wasn't overpowering, but still really good.

Amazing! I didn't have any rum so I just excluded it. I also used Pecans instead of walnuts. My husband and I loved this. However, it is SUPER rich. I recommend only one scoop of ice cream with a little of the bananas foster. Delicious! I will definitely make this again for a dinner party.

Loved it.  Made it with rum extract, added a splash of half n half and left out the cinnamon - still awesome.  Even without the vanilla ice cream.  We just ate a bowlful of bananas and happiness abounded.  Can't wait to make it again!

Amazing!  I made this for friends and for my mom.  Both times the pan was scrapped clean with a spatula.  Everyone loved it!  I highly recommend it!

Super easy, measurements can be approximate.

Butter + sugar + liquor + heat = yum!

Great recipe!  I sliced 4 bananas into the pan and we used it on pancakes for breakfast.  It's a great way to use really ripe bananas when you don't have time to make banana bread.  I already knew Bananas Foster is great on ice cream.

Outstanding! Found this recipe last week and have already made it three times. This morning I served it over Belgium waffles and my family loved it. I don't have rum and used banana flavor instead. Thank you!

This was amazing.I made it for dessert following some spicy jambalaya, and all my guests asked for seconds. The recipe is easy to follow,I didn't even really measure the ingredients so much as eyeball the amounts and it turned out fine. The only caveat is that you need to serve it with good quality ice cream, without that it probably would have been just above average.

Used imitation rum extract but didnt reduce the portion so the sauce turned out on the bitter/sour side.  It actually worked out because I used apple-bananas and drizzled the dish with honey at service.  I left out the walnuts and used vanilla bean gelato.  Tasted wonderful =)

Came home from a restaurant that makes this but the manager was not in to make it for us so I made it myself and I am sure mine is better... skipped the walnuts and the rum and it was still darn delicious.. Never had this before now and it will be a family tradition to have this often.

It's incredible.  What can I say.  Make sure you get the dark rum, I bought the little sample bottles.  Guy at the liquor store helped me.  I was making two small servings, 1 bottle was fine.  This was to DIE FOR.  Will make again.  I had some bananas that were overripe and I wanted to use them, I hate throwing produce out...  Delicious!

I tried this recipe on a whim and it was delicious. Simple recipe, quick to make, and the flavor is great. I had it with chocolate ice cream because it was all I had, but I do believe it will be even better with vanilla. It it reminiscent of banana bread.

I liked this, but it wasn't as good as I expected. Just tasted like bananas in a caramel rum sauce.  I loved how quick it was to make, though.

It was great! I used Orange flavored Rum because that's all I had but I really had a taste. Turned out great. A little different from what I am used to since I used to eat Bananas Foster made by a Louisiana native. Yummy! So fast to make too!

This recipe was great.  I haven't had Bananas Foster before, but it will be a regular at our home now.  It's easy to make yet it really impresses the guests.  Highly recommended.  :)

My family loved it!! My only concern was not burning off the rum! So I cooked it a little longer until the taste of alcohol had disappated. I put the bananas in too soon and they were mushy. Next time I will cook longer and then add the bananas.

rum adds a nice kick - don't leave it out.  i think it could use a bit of orange zest or lemon zest.

Hellooooo Everyone! This is so yummy. I thought it sounded a little wierd, but I was looking for an ultra-quick way to use up bananas. Gasp! I found a recipe that will be used over and over. This is easy enough for a quick late-night comfort snack, but nice enough for a formal sit - down dinner. Thanks for the great recipe! Yum.

This is delicious! I made it to put over French toast so I omitted the rum and I used pecans because I don't like walnuts. I can't wait to try with the rum for dessert!

I was craving something sweet and this definitely hit the spot. In my house bananas don't go as fast as they should, so I decided to search for a quick and easy recipe. OMG did I come across the right one. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of run, because I didn't have any. It was perfect even without. The combination of the hot bananas and sauce and the coldest of the ice cream (vanilla bean) made my night. Thanks Buttermebread for posting!!

This was awesome! My Boyfriend has requested it every night since I made it the first time...it taste just like what we get at the restaurants. I used Malibu Rum and pecans instead of walnuts, it came out great. Thanks!

This was pretty good, I was a little disappointed that I could not taste tyhe rum however, it seems to have evaporated. All in all tasted pretty good.

This is so good and so easy. I didn't have rum, so I took another reviewer's advice and used 1 tsp imitation rum flavor and 2 tsp water for 1 Tbls rum. It was excellent. I also used pecans in place of the walnuts.  I didn't have vanilla ice cream, so I used whipped cream. Yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was OK. Easy to make, but not fabulous. I have had bananas foster that I have liked better. Maybe too much sugar was the problem, as they did seem too sweet.

Yummy! This is a great dessert to serve for company. When I have them on hand, I like to use pecans instead of the walnuts.

Delicious! A little too runny and saucy for my taste, though. I may not have let it thicken enough before putting bananas in though, so could be my fault. the vanilla and cinnamon gave it a little something extra that I haven't tried with bananas foster before. Very good! Oh, I used coconut rum instead of regular and it tasted really good :)

Yum yum yum!  I'm kind of funny about bananas (thanks to banana-flavored medicine as a kid; I still gag thinking about it), but this was incredible!  The only thing is I wanted to flambe it, but the rum wouldn't catch on fire.  Just as well, I guess...  It was truly delicious, though.  Don't skip the walnuts; they're essential.

Fantastic!  Oooh La La!  My husband does not eat dessert, unless it is either bananas foster or creme brulee.  This bananas foster recipe ROCKS!  Thanks for helping me put a smile on my sweetie's face :)

This was so easy to make & it turned out great.  I didn't have enough vanilla (maybe only 1/2 tsp) so I put water in the empty bottle to make it 1.5 tsp & it still turned out delicious!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is delicious!  I reduced the butter by half and the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup to help cut the calories a bit.  I also like to catch mine on fire, so I add a bit more rum than the recipe calls for.

So, so YUMMY, absolutely delicious. Very easy and a fast dessert to make but yet it would seem as though it took forever! It stays well in the fridge for the next day. That's if you have any leftover!!!!

Very good recipe. Only difference is that I found my hidden bottle of rum had been emptied and the kids had filled it with water and coke! I substituted cognac, and it basically tasted the same as if I had used rum.

Slowly heated the sugar/rum/bananas to the perfect texture, bananas still firm.

Serve over Banana Pancakes
reduce butter to 1/8 cup
   add 1/8 cup applesauce
reduce brown sugar to 1/3 cup
increase vanilla to 2 tsp
reduce rum to 1 tbls
Applesauce changes consistency and lowers fat and calorie count, but not flavor.

Delicious but way too rich for me.  My husband gave it 5 stars, though so I compromised with 4. The boiling gave it a very dark molasses flavor (I used light brown sugar), and even though I love molasses, it was a little much.

WOW!!!  This was the BEST!!!  I'm a Diabetic so tweeking this was essential, like substituting the white sugar for SPLENDA'S Brown Sugar Blend and I used Rum Extract instead of Rum. FANTASTIC!! I've made this a few times and Bourbon works as well.  Thanks, Laureen Marie

Scaled down the recipe to 2 servings (2 bananas) and used 1/4 c of brown sugar. Only had Neapolitan ice cream, but it still tasted great.

My husband absolutely inhaled this dessert.  It was divine, decadent, delicious, and quick & easy to make.  A suggestion - if making this for more than two people, better double or triple the recipe to ensure there are enough servings, as nobody will want to miss out on this one; it's a winner.

Had some friends over for dinner tonight.  While they were eating this dessert they kept saying "oh, this is so good".  They took copies of the recipe home with them.  I followed the directions exactly.

This recipe is excellent. The cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar flavors intermingle beautifully. Paired with vanilla ice cream, the sauce is just killer! I made mine without rum and it was scrumptious. The only fault with this recipe is that the heat from the sauce melts the ice cream within seconds. Perhaps when I make this recipe next time, I will serve the ice cream and Bananas Foster sauce in different bowls. Bottom line: Delicious, elegant, and unique sauce that is wondrous with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe was great and so easy to prepare. We served it over frozen Haagen Dazs vanilla yogurt and loved it. My husband thinks it would be a great topping over French toast. Next time I'll try it with pecans instead of the walnuts, and we will definitely make this one again.

Very good. Very sweet. I used it as a filling in crepes and topped it with whipped cream. Hubby doesn't usually like banana desserts, but was impressed with this. I agree with the other reviewer who think it needs more banana. (Maybe 1 more?)

Yummy but SWEET! Really really sweet. I have made it with rum extract (for non drinkers) and also with real rum. Either way, it's pretty tasty and people seem quite rapt with it, but I don't like it personally. It's just insanely sweet. I suppose that's the point, and the vanilla ice cream helps to cut the sweetness, but it's just so sweet. We have bananas in our yard, so I try to use a variety of banana recipes, and will continue to serve this to my family and to guests. It's also nice to use the leftovers as a topping for buckwheat banana walnut pancakes (which aren't as sweet to begin with, so can handle the sweetness of this). Pretty good stuff, and super easy to make.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used pecans instead of walnuts and it was perfect.  Use organic bananas since regular bananas are one of the worst sources of pesticides.

This was fantastic - not too heavy, not too sugarry or sweet. Chopping up the bananas nice and small make them slightly more tender and really compliments the whole dessert. We made it without the rum and loved it - I've made other versions with the rum and it was too alcohol tasting. This was perfect.

Wow, what a way to jazz up Sunday morning pancakes!  This was a perfect topping/syrup for buttermilk pancakes!  I had everything on hand and it was so simple to whip up!  Not a drop leftover, can't wait to try it over ice-cream!

If they had a 10 star rating, this recipe would definitely get all ten stars!!! This was the BEST bananas foster I have ever tasted in my life!! I used pecans in place of walnuts, and I used the rum extract with the water.  It was DELICIOUS!! I will be making this all the time.  Thanks sooo much for this recipe!

I tried this on the bbq and it gives it a more distinctive flavor. I substituted the rum with bourbon and cooking on the bbq eliminated the alcohol. I also substituted the walnuts for pecans. Delicious.

This was yummy! My husband and I loved it. Our kids weren't crazy about it, but ate it anyway. I didn't add walnuts, but when I told my husband they're supposed to be in there he said "yummmmm". So, next time we'll add those. Thanks for a quick and satisfying sweet treat.

UNBELIEVABLE dessert! I've been making this for over five years now after finding it posted on another recipe site. It is an EXTREMELY easy recipe and is as good or better than something you'd order in a trendy upscale restaurant. Like another reviewer, I've always presented it in pretty margarita/martini glasses and have received RAVE REVIEWS every time I've served it.

This is a definite keeper for your recipe archive. Thanks a million, Buttermebread!

This was awesome!  I made it for the first time last night for my parents and boyfriend and they were licking the plates.  My boyfriend said it was the best dessert he has ever had in his life.  I made the recipe as it was stated and I wouldn't change a thing.

I didn’t hate it but I couldn’t find anything special about this recipe.  I love bananas, rum and ice cream and I thought this would be a perfect combination for me, but it turned out to be just “okay”.  I tried it twice and I added some lemon juice for the second time and I liked it better than without it.  Since everybody is giving it 5 stars and it is really easy to make, let me try to make this for my friends and see what they are going to say.

Wow!  This recipe is super simple and quick to prepare and yields fantastic results.  I improvised my own variations.  First, I adjusted the recipe to only one serving and it called for 3/4 of a banana but I used a whole banana.  Next, I didnt have any walnuts so I used a 50/50 mixture of pecans and pinenuts.  I also used Flor De Cana Dark Rum from Nicaragua (this is a high-end rum).  I followed recipe for the rest of the recipe.  Instead of serving over ice cream I served it over a slice of apple pie and I craved more.  Next time I will serve the pie a la mode then top it with the bananas foster!  5-STAR RECIPE: quick, easy, succulent

FANTASTIC..oh my gosh, just like at a restaurant. I added 99 banana liqour and mmmm mmmm. Everyone loved them, even the people who are not the biggest banana fans. I have become addicted. Great over vanilla ice-cream, I find myself licking the sauce from the pan off my finger, so good. I definately am keeping this recipe close. So easy and very quick, and no mess. Adults, and kids love this...perfect for a dinner party...A+A+

This was a great recipe.  I always wanted to make it and finally, for Thanksgiving, I did.  It was a big hit even though everyone made fun of me for adding to the dozens of desserts we already planned to serve.  I highly recommend.

Excellent recipe. My 15 year old daughter requested "Bananas Foster" and in 20 minutes she was eating it. I'm not sure who loved it more her or her father! If you have bananas you're there!!

Wow! I made this last night. I used pecans only b/c I didn't have walnuts. What a wonderful recipe. It's so easy and fast. If you want to impress guests, or your spouse, but don't have a lot of time, go for this one. I went back into the kitchen and started eating the leftovers out of the pan.

Very good.  My boyfriend LOVED it!  If he were rating he'd give it 5 stars for sure.  I thought it was ok, it was missing something, I'm not sure what...  I will make this again, he wouldn't let me not make it again, hes already raved to his friends and requested it again.  Thanks for sharing this yummy dessert with us.

Fantastic recipe!  Simple, quick, tasty, easily scaled down (I made it for 2), and different from your standard chocolate cake or pie dessert.  Definitely a dish to impress company.  Also like that I didn't have to light the sauce... much less scary.

This is the BEST dessert ever!!!!  We have served this for company lots of times and have never had a complaint.  It looks good, tastes sinful and is oh so fattening.  This isn't a recipe for the faint of heart.  This is a keeper!  It is so fast and easy to whip together too!
