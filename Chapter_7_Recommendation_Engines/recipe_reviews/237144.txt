This is a very moist and delicious pina colada muffin.  I made these into mini-muffins and baked for 12 minutes.  I used pineapple chunks (well-drained) and overly ripe bananas. Even though the recipe did not call for them, I added 1/2 c. of finely chopped walnuts. Since we are lovers of coconut, I sprinkled some toasted coconut over the top of the muffins when I removed them from the oven. This would make an excellent muffin for a brunch or shower. This was the AR Buzz Recipe Group selection for the week of 4/5/14.  Thank you, EatCookLove90 for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper for me!

Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I cut the pineapple chunks so the kids could eat them easily and cut the rum extract in 1/2, which was perfect for us. Mine only needed 20 minutes to bake, so keep an eye on them. Oh, and I got 16 muffins out of the recipe. Moist and flavorful, these are a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were very good. They turned out very moist and not overly sweet. I used over ripe bananas. These looked so nice; I liked the way the coconut toasted a bit on top. I used pineapple tidbits instead of chunks, and I think crushed pineapple would work nicely also, just drain really well. I didn't have rum extract, so I used real rum, but I couldn't taste it in the finished prouduct. I need to buy some rum extract and try these again sometime. I got this from Recipe Group but made it a couple weeks late.

Recipe Group Selection:  05, April 2014 ~ Delicious and simple muffin.  I baked in my mini muffin pans and got 36 from a single batch.  Like Shearones, they were done in 12 minutes.  Because my guys aren't crazy about coconut, I put the 3/4 cup in the batter, but only added it to the tops of 12 before baking. Since I was making smaller muffins I used tidbits rather than chunks.  I drained the pineapple really well and used the pineapple juice to make a batch of gelatin. My DH must have really liked them, coconut included and all, because 2 minutes out of the oven and he was eating his first one.  Five minutes later and he had eaten 3!  Thanks, EatCookLove90 for sharing your muffin recipe.

Delicious recipe! But I changed it a tad bit:
- Used pineapple tidbits instead of chunks so they were chopped smaller
- Used sweetened coconut
- Baked it in a loaf pan to make French toast out of it. The most AMAZING French toast ever!!! Made it for Motherâ€™s Day brunch and everyone raved!! :)

These rank as one of the best muffins I have ever made!  Followed the recipe exactly excepting for using pineapple tidbits in lieu of chunks and I added an unmeasured amount of chopped walnuts which I thought was a great addition!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made these with the addition of an extra egg and 1/3 cup of milled flax, and used coconut oil in place of butter. Sticking with the given 12 muffins had me a bit worried that they'd overflow the tins, but (maybe because of the extra egg) they just domed beautifully in 25 minutes. Delicious at first try - I chopped up pineapple rings and made the chunks a bit too small, but the coconut topping adds nice texture. Hopefully they'll overnight well in a sealed produce container.

These are a very good breakfast muffin if you're looking for something not overly sweet.  I cooked them for 25 minutes in my toaster oven and then let them sit 10 minutes in the warm oven after it shut off.  Perfect!
The second time I made these muffins;  I added 1/2 pecans- delicious!

This is the second time I am making this recipe as written,
these are delicious and moist - a nice change from regular
banana nut muffins.  Another great way to use
up those overripe bananas!

Very good, made mine with whole wheat flour and fresh pineapples. I did find they were a bit soggy the following day but could have been the use of fresh pineapples instead of canned. Flavours were great.
