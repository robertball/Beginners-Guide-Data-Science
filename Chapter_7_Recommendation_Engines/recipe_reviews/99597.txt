We've been making these since we were kids.  The egg/rice balance is really important - we generally mix the egg and milk, then add rice a bit at a time to be sure we keep things from getting too dry.  It needs to be a little soupy for the egg to hold it all together when cooked up.  I think day-old rice is better here (just like with fried rice) because of the change in consistency.  Also, try leaving out the onion, putting a bit of salt on them when frying, then top them with syrup.  We've always done this as a sweet breakfast and not a savory snack.  mmmm (either way)

I doubled the recipe and test-tasted the first one off the grill.  Really nice flavor although I had trouble getting the "pancakes" to stay together in the pan.  I stacked the rest of them with plastic wrap between each one in the fridge so they can be a quick breakfast or snack later.

This wasn't bad, the finished product reminds me of potato pancakes. So topped with sour cream and salsa was a thought to try with them. But I went ahead and sweetened this pancake up with raisins cinnamon and some stevia. Which I enjoyed just eating plain.

I had left over brown rice and added leftover frozen veggies that were already cooked.  I also added sauteed diced onion. I added a little flour to bind and a little baking powder for lightness...FABULOUS!   Brown and crispy outside and light and creamy and fluffy inside.  I am not a fan of brown rice(that is why it was leftover) but it worked beautifully for this dish.

I was expecting this to be a lot more flavorful than it was. It's pretty plain, but it's the kind of mellow flavor where it's still really tasty to eat. I had mine with some ketchup to liven up the flavor a bit. I will make these again. :) But next time I'll find something to add that will really bump up the flavor. I was thinking some garlic salt would be nice. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great idea.  I've found that adding a little flour to thicken it helps a lot.  Some fresh onion instead of just powder is great as well.

I cooked my rice the night before and added grated parmesan and some italian seasoned bread crumbs, which really gave this recipe the little flavor kick it was missing. I also browned the butter pretty good before I put the rice patties in. Delicious!

A little bland as is,  but held together much better than expected.

These came out nice. Tasty and light.  

I had made some very bland and slightly underdone rice last night, and there was plenty left over (imagine that).  I was looking for something to do with it, and came across this.  Because my rice was so bland, I added fresh onion, garlic powder, and some curry powder as well.  

Next time I will try a sweet version.

Thanks, Jen.

I had leftover rice I wanted to do something and after reading the reviews decided to make more of a breakfast cake.  I left out the chives, onion, salt/pepper and added cinnomon, honey and some panko bread crumbs for consistency.  I think they turned out perfectly and could be eaten plain, with syrup. honey or fruit topping.
