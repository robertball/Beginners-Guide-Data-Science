Crispy Oven Beef & Bean Tostadas Haiku: "Well, I liked the beans, but they were just from a can. Could be simplified." I followed the recipe submitter's notes for "if you like your ground beef a bit more spicy", and truthfully, found that all of the seasoning didn't do a whole lot for us, and that we had to add alot of salsa and hot sauce (along w/ typical garnishes of lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese) for more flavor. I think AR's Bill Echol's taco seasoning blend, or a traditional packet would've been much more flavorful. Tostadas were just fine, but to me, they're just the vessel for getting food from plate to my mouth, and I would've been OK w/ a box of taco shells. I will say that I've never schmeared refried beans on b4 adding taco meat, so that was the most positive aspect that I will take (and recreate) from this recipe; yummy layer of refried beans squishing under the weight of the other ingredients was super, thanks! :-)

This is my recipe and there is an error on the beans. It should read  2 cups of refried beans you make yourself (or 16 oz. can of refried beans.) However, the published version does not state you can cook your own beans. We love to make our own homemade beans, then mash into refried beans for tostadas. Also, some corn tortillas labeled as soft don't seem to crisp up in the oven.

Warning: These tostadas will spoil you. Try one, and you can't stop eating them.  I used the spicy mix for the meat and it was very nice. I used handmade tortillas and homemade refried beans. These are perfect for buffet style lunches so everyone can build their own tostada but using the beans as "glue" for all the other ingredients is genius. Once you try these, you won't accept restaurant tostadas ever again! Thank you for sharing the recipe  with us.

Wondering what you do with the bowl of garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder and cumin?  Does not say what to do with it.  I spiced it up a bit with jalapeno chunks, chipotle pepper and sliced avocado.
