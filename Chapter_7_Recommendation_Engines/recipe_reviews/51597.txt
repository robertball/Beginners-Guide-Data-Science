Made as written, using creamy peanut butter and topped with Reeses Pieces because I had them. THey are tasty! Quite a hit with a few who have tried them. I mailed most of them, so we'll see how they travel in 2-3 days... will update later!

These were OK, but a little harder than I like - I'm a chewy/cakey cookie fan. However, the combination of chocolate and peanut butter was delicious.

Loved these!  I doubled the recipe and used part semi-sweet (for melting), part milk-chocolate (for mixing into the dough).  Yes, I used a LOT of chocolate chips today!  They were pretty easy to make.  I ran out of peanut butter as I was filling the thumbprints, so I used some Halloween M&M's in some, and in the rest, I used leftover white chocolate ganache.  For the ganache-filled ones, I waited until they were completely cool to fill.  (I made an indentation with a wooden spoon for those ones).  I liked the pb filled ones best though.  Will make again!

The cookie base itself is pretty tastey but once you add the peanut butter in the thumbprint fashion, it was too rich for me.
