I did not have heavy cream on hand but I did have fat free half-n-half, which I used instead. I did not use the full pint, just enough to get the potatoes nice and fluffy. VERY good--it reminded me of the mashed potatoes that Grandma made when I was little. NO leftovers, the boys ate it all.

Great idea!! I used Yukon gold and the results were 'golden'! (The steaming time of 20 minutes listed seems a little short, especially given the size of most russets. After 25 minutes, the smaller Yukon golds were not quite fork tender yet.) I mashed mine with the skins - that's where all the nutrients are! Hands down, the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever made!! And I hate instant potato flakes, but what a great way to save runny mashed potatoes! (For those making comments about the instant potatoes: Please READ the directions: she says to only add them if needed for consistency! A better option than runny potatoes, in my opinion!) Thank you for the GREAT idea!

Loved these--made them last night and they came out delicious.  I did not end up needing the instant flakes, although I have used them before as a backup.  The heavy cream is soooooo perfect in these!  Thank you Susiq2!

Could be worse. It just didn't have any bacon in it. That was a downer.

I think I messed it up, but mine were way too thin. I usually make thicker hand mashed potatoes with much less liquid. I'll try it again, but I'll be careful to reduce the amount of liquids.

I chose to make these for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe with the exception of the instant potatoes and unsalted butter. I just added the cream a little at a time to keep them from getting runny. I used salted butter to give it a little taste. I also transferred to an aluminum pan and put them in the oven on the top rack at 400 for 10 min to brown the top a little. I got great reviews from the family. (I also had to triple the recipe).I will make these again for my family.
