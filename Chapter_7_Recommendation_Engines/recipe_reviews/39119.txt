If you like thick clam chowder, this is for you.  I made mine with low fat turkey bacon and non-fat Carnation condensed milk and it still turned out thick and rich.  It was delicious!

This recipe was very easy to follow, and quick to put together.  The addition of evaporated milk added a special touch.  It was a very chunky and tasty chowder.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

This is a great chowder! I like it thick.  I used frozen clams my family dug on the Washington coast. Our new favorite!

Recipe was delicious but a little too thick. It also makes a lot! I added water the following day to thin it a little. It was still yummy.

Very thick and creamy, but very sweet, which could have been due to the red bliss potatoes.  I substituted fat-free half & half for the milk, and clam juice for the water.  I also doubled the potatoes and sauteed them with the onions, celery and carrots in butter.  Also added white pepper, garlic salt, a pinch of celery salt and thyme.

Really enjoyed this recipe. For my taste, it could use more clams to compensate for the other ingredients. But the flavor was great. My wife loved it too.

This chowder is very easy to make (I'm sixteen!) though I doubled the amount of pepper for more flavor. It was excellent! My family loved it!

I used fresh clams. Changed the cooking a little.After cooking the potatoes for 7 minutes, I added the juice from the fresh clams and the water. I let that cook about 10 minutes, until the potatoes were tender. Then I added the rest except for the fresh clams, I cooked it for about 5 to 10 minutes, till it thickened a little, then I added the fresh clams and cooked for about 5 minutes, it was out of this world. Both my husband and I loved it, will be making this again for sure.

This was pretty good.  Turned out very thick and creamy.  Almost too thick, in fact (for me at least).  When I eat the leftovers maybe I'll thin it out with some milk or something.  Instead of the water and salt, I added a cup of chicken broth that needed to be used.  I also increased the carrots, celery and onion to 1/2 cup.  The evaporated milk made it a little yellow-ish.  I would give this recipe 3 stars, but my hubby liked it and said 4 stars.

This was my first time making clam chowder and loved how easy this recipe was.  I took some suggestions from others and added more veggies and spices.  I think the trick to making it more flavorful was I used 6 slices of bacon and fish stock instead of the water.  Will be saving this recipe!

I usually base the recipes on whether my husband has more than one helping and has it the next day.  He ate it for supper, and that was it.  It was good but ....I don't know...very milky.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Great soup, I would add more clams because it's definitely not clammy enough.  Taste was really good! Potato cooking took longer than noted on this recipe.  Will make this again, but I'll add more clams to give it more punch!

Excellent. My son used this recipe for a dutch oven cook-off with Boy Scouts. He needed to make it user friendly for camp-outs, so he used frozen cubed southwestern potatoes, and he ground up peppercorns at home and omited the carrots and onions.  He quadrupled the recipe and no less than 50 people tasted and tested this recipe. They raved over the flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe a bit too "bacon-y"  and not "clammy" enough for us.   I will try again and use less bacon, and more clams.   Texture was good, just a bit thick.  Very easy to make.

This was my first attempt at making clam chowder, and while the soup was good, we found it very rich - a little goes a long way.  I recommend this soup as an appetizer, but as a main course, you just can't eat a lot of it.  I did not find the soup to be too thick as other reviewers have suggested.

This was awesome!  It was my first try at a clam chowder and I am glad I picked this recipe.  Rich, thick and hearty....and beautiful, too.  Hubby thought the veggies should have been cooked more, so you couldn't pick up the texture, but I really liked the little bit of textural variety.

pretty good as is. we added more clams, more spices, old bay, tarragon, thyme more pepper. turned out great! not sweet at all, i think maybe some people added CONDENSED milk and not EVAPORATED milk. big difference there:) 
made a batch of cheddar bay biscuits and had a happy family:)

Agreed with other reviewers. It lacked the clam flavor (I even used a bottle of clam juice instead of adding water). It was a little too thick and creamy for my taste - would use Half and Half instead. The evaporated milk also gave it a slighly yellowish tint.

This is a great recipe...I think because of the sauteed veggies, it just had extra flavor. I used whipping cream instead of the milk. The result? 'Ivar's' or 'Anthony's' chowder!

I thought it turned out too sweet and it pretty much just tasted like potato soup that happened to have clams in it. Not sure what went wrong. I perfer my clam chowder to taste a little clammy, this didnt at all. I will find a different recipe or just buy a can of clam chowder soup - that would save me money.

I added a pound of white fish (any kind will do).  It made the soup heartier.  I think the next time I may add a pound of shrimp, too!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was OK.  The flavor was alright, but it seemed to be missing something.  I did add clam juice, which helped.  My husband really liked it though, so I'll probably make it again, and try to find out what's missing.

I like this recipe


















I've made a very similar recipe all my cooking life.  I prefer thin chowder so I omit the flour.  Leaving out the worchestershire sauce, I season with celery seed, dried thyme leaves, crumbled and a torn up bay leaf that is removed at serving time.  The Carnation milk makes a rich-tasting but lower fat and lower calorie version.  Yummy!

Overall, good basic clam chowder recipe.  I will add chopped or whole clams next time though.  It was too easy to miss the minced clams.  I also added a jar of clam juice and extra bacon to add more flavor.

Loved this!  I used 3 cans of clams and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk (because that was what I had on hand).  It wasn't salty enough for my taste so added 1/2 T Janes Crazy Mixed-up Salt (a staple in my kitchen) and a generous pat of butter right at the end.

This was so good my roomate who doesn't like clam chowder ate it and proclaimed it very good.

This was my first attempt at making clam chower.  my husband  didn't like how chunky it was but that is personal preference. My kids 12,11,9 and 3 liked it as well. I would say it's a keeper =) Thank you for the recipe!
