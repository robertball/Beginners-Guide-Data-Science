Cooking the chicken in the Sauvignon Blanc makes it very tender, moist and tasty. HOWEVER, if anyone thinks that a 3.5 pound chicken is going to feed 6 people, especially 3 men, you've got another thing to think about! After considering this factor, I used a 7 pound capon and roasted it instead of cooking it on top of the stove. I basted every 25 minutes which kept it moist. I served it with varigated wild rice, and the end results was rave reviews by all!
