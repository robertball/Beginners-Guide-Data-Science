I loved this! I was looking for a recipe to use up 2 ounces of mushrooms and I found this. There are  a handful of recipes that I make more than once and this one's going into my rotation. As a side it makes 4 very tasty portions, thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy, but even though I tripled the recipe, it wasnâ€™t enough for my family of five.
