My first time making a pie crust from scratch. Very easy and quick. I doubled the recipe to make a bottom and upper crust for a chicken pot pie. I baked the bottom crust at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. I added the salt and dry mustard as suggested by the submitter. I will never buy a frozen pie crust again! Thank you for the recipe.
