What a simple, and delightful new way to eat poached eggs! You wouldn't think the addition of a bit of lemon juice and olive oil would make that big of a difference, but it really does! There's a nice brightness added to egg when it's made this way. And did I mention it's insanely easy to make too?! This is something I will definitely make often--thank you so much for the recipe!
