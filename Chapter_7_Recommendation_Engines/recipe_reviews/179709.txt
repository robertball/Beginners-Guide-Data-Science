A good recipe to throw together quickly while cooking supper. I can see the potential to make many alterations to the dish as well but I made it just as the recipe called. Will make again.

I love this crisp recipe. I made it again this morning and mixed a can of cheries and a can of apple pie filling. Just tasted it and it is fantastic. Other then using different fruits I would not change a thing.

Hubs was a much bigger fan of this than I was, but then I donâ€™t care for oats in my crumble toppings.  Still, he enjoyed it, albeit with lots of whipped cream.  For an easy dessert he enjoyed that took only a couple of minutes to throw together with not much more than a can of pie filling, four stars.

This is yummy!  I added 2 tsp. of pure almond extract to the cherries the first time I made it.  The next time, I did 1 can of cherry and 1 can of apple pie filling!  Also yummy!  The crispy top is so good!  Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for a real treat!  :-)
