this is a really good recipe, but I did make some changes.. I didn't use the steak sauce at all, and I used the sugar twin brown sugar, and one carb ketsup to cut the sugar, and carb content. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, and a ton more liquid smoke. Good stuff!

Great flavors!  We like it a bit sweeter, so I added 2 Tbsp. honey.  Didn't have any Jack Daniels, so used Hieneken beer instead.  Thank you Natalie for sharing this recipe.

My wife said that this wasn't sweet enough, but I loved it.  Next time I'll add more brown sugar if she's a good girl.

This has got to be the best rib sauce I have ever had.  Even beats out restaurants.  Thanks

We're the opposite of all of the other reviewers - this was too sweet for us!  Slid off our bs chicken breasts while grilling too.

I made this recipe recently; just did not add the liquid smoke as I did not have any. The recipe was good and a little zingy! Excellent on Kielbasa! Would definitely make this one again!

Very good sauce, I only made a couple of changes to spice it up. Instead of 4 drops of hot pepper sauce and 4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce I upped it to a tablespoon each. I also upped the whiskey from 2 tablespoons to a full shot. Lastly I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

this is our go to ribs sauce!  I have made this several times and it always turns out awesome!  I just recently picked up some liquid smoke in the states so we will see this weekend if it adds to the flavor or takes away!
