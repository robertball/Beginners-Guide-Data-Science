This was what Mom called Shepherd's Pie. She varied the ingredients depending on what she had on hand--any kind of condensed soup or canned/frozen vegetables will work in the pie. Us kids always prefered it made with cream of mushroom soup and canned corn. When I make this now, I add a few spices to the "gravy", like fresh ground pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and basil or oregano. There's usually no leftovers.

I know everyone hates when people change the recipes; but it was sooo good! ok so I used instant loaded potatoes (2 packages) added sour cream, butter, cheese, & 1/2 cup crushed up frenchs fried onion strings the mashed potatoes (just like if you were going to eat it by itself) didn't use any kind of veggie in it. I also used chucky tomato basil soup (another time I used regular tomato soup but added a can of diced tomatoes and some basil). we like spices so I added zesty seasoning (kroger brand) about 1-2 tablespoons while I simmered the meat and onions. followed all the other directions, but added 1 cup of cheese on top and sprinkled about 1/2 cup of semi crushed fried onion strings. I only cooked it for 15 mins and it was sooo yummy!! this is such a basic recipe you can change so much to fit your tastes. ive included a pic of what it looked like done. ENJOY!

Very good. We know this as shepherds pie. This was the very first thing I ever made for my husband back twenty something years ago.  The rest of the family enjoys it as well. The only thing I do different is use corn in place of green beans because that's what we prefer.

I made this exactly as written.  The only thing I didn't like was the addition of garlic to the mashed potatoes.  It really never gets cooked so the potatoes had that raw garlic taste to them.  Perhaps it would be better to add it to the hamburger/onion mixture and cook it instead.  Overall pretty good.

My granddaughter and I love looking at all the recipes and we decided on this one because it seemed relatively easy with ingredients we had on hand. Followed the directions to the tee and it turned out great! It will go into “family favorites”!

The adults in my family enjoyed this dish, however, the grandchildren did not (ages 5 & 7).  They said it was because they didn't like the tomato soup.  It takes a little prep time because of having to peel, cook, and mash potatoes.

I hate when people change the recipe and then rate it but that's exactly what I'm going to do because I was i a rush and had to use what I had on hand. I kept the sauce part the same except I added about half a can of cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have another can of tomato soup and needed to make the meal go farther. Then I used cheesy instant potatoes because again I was crunched for time and that's what I had on hand. This still turned out super good. It isn't exactly pretty to look at but it's just awesome comfort food. Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and my family really enjoyed it. There's no left overs!  The mashed potatoes were really moist and held well with the egg as a binder when it was baking.  I did not add the tomato soup or any other soups but I did add a can of sweet whole kernel corn with no liquid.  A keeper for my recipe book for sure!

This is our favorite and have been eating it for 50 years. We don't use onions - just brown the ground beef , stir in the tomato soup spread it in the casserole dish, top it with green beans, then shredded cheese if you like, spread mashed potatoes over the top minus the egg, put pats of butter on top, bake it until it gets bubbly. yum yum yum

This was really good.  I made this as directed except for the mashed potatoes.  Last night I made the slow cooker mashed potatoes by BWAYE ( Delicious) on Allrecipes and used the leftover mashed potatoes for this recipe.  It was really good.  Everyone really enjoyed it and asked that I make it again.

Loved this!  Great family friendly, comfort food!  Kid approved too. The only things I changed were because it was what I had on hand- corn instead of green beans, and instant instead of fresh potatoes. Excellent!

Great for a cold day! Sprinkled paprika on top and just threw in what veggies we had - snap peas do the trick. Used veal and sharp cheddar and of course Tabasco sauce.

Pretty good.  I added garlic salt in place of salt and minced garlic since it seemed odd to add garlic to potatoes without sautéing the garlic first.

It's a meal all by itself!  My teenaged boys are more about the meat and less about the potatoes, so next time I plan to double the meat and halve the potatoes.  This time,  I added corn instead of beans, but may try the beans in the future.  I was skeptical about the tomato soup, but it added a surprisingly delicious flavor!  Will add this to my repertoire!

My family went back for seconds!  I will make this again.  I used a slightly larger can of green beans, a dash of Worcestershire and garlic powder , and had to make instant mashed potatoes for the top, sprinkled with Mexican 4 cheeses.  Delicious!

I made this tonight. The only change I made was substituting fresh green beans. It's very tasty and satisfies men and children alike.

I had the box of hashbrowns Hungry Jack so added water to box then poured over potatoes.  So easy!!!!!!!!!! I only had corn so thats what I used.  It was incredible! I hope someyone finds the box of potatoes to save a ton of time.  They are located near the instant ones.

I made it with the mushroom soup and corn variant that others mentioned.  Threw in some extra chopped mushrooms.  Everyone loved it!

This was a great meal. The only thing I disliked were the green beans, I think a different vegetable would be a better substitute, like perhaps peas. It was a lot of prep work as well. Other than that it was delicious and filling.

Gotta say that I really didn't like this. Not traditional Shepherd's Pie at all, too sweet in the meat layer, not enough proper spicing.

I used to make this recipe for my family years ago and have since forgotten all about it.  The only small insignificant change was that I added parsley to the potatoes and spread them over the meat mixture (my kids called it green potatoes). A great cool weather dish.  Brought back a lot of memories. Thanks!!

Best thing ever! I've made this weekly since discovering it!! I made it a little easier by using Betty Crocker brand "Loaded Mashed" instant potatoes.  It was a 5 star recipe prior to that though...

My family enjoyed this. I had to sub peas for the green beans, due to a picky 7 year old. Had no leftovers.

Easy and really good. Comfort food on a cold winter day.
