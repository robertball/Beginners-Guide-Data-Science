This was a terrific quick bread. I added cloves of garlic, chopped. I took this to dinner at a friend's house, where I was told " this tastes like a bread from a gourmet shop." This was served with a crab linguine with spinach and fresh vegetables. Another keeper in my allrecipes recipe box.

This bread was okay, but I was hoping for the flavor of the basil to come through more than it did. I could taste the sun dried tomatoes much more than the herbs. Oh well. Not a bad bread, but just not what I was expecting. If nothing else, thanks for the opportunity to try something new!

This bread was quick, easy, and wonderful.  I used about 1/2 & 1/2 w.w. flour and white flour to make it a little more hearty.  I also baked it as a round loaf on a flat cooking sheet to give it a crispier crust.  YUM!

I am totally hooked on this bread!!! I have made it about 3-4 times now, and I love it more each time.  I used leftover homemmade pesto instead of basil and olive oil since it was so close, and it turned out fine.

This bread is very good with some additions.  I think it needs more salt and next time I would increase this to 1 tsp.  I added in chopped garlic and Parmesan cheese with the basil and sun-dried tomatoes as other reviewers suggested.  It turned out great and I used rapid rise yeast as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

If you grow basil, make this bread.  The smell alone is worth it, but the taste is equally wonderful.  Simple, easy, and delicious.

I blended the sun dried in with the basil and oil in the food processor to get them finely chopped.  I preheated my pizza stone in the oven, rolled the dough into a ball, and baked in the oven for 35 minutes.  Make sure you watch it so that it doesn't get too dark.  If using sundried tomatoes packed in oil, at least half the oil.  It's a bit greasy if you keep the same amount of oil since some stays on the tomatoes.  I think I'll also add some garlic and parmesean into the food processer when mixing the basil and tomatoes.

Very good, with a very prominent flavor from the sundried tomatoes.  Brought this to a breakfast yesterday and at least one coworker really enjoyed it--she asked me for the recipe and is having the leftovers for breakfast today.  This is a bread you could eat by itself with just some butter or cheese, as it's very flavorful.  I left off the butter and used dried basil since I have no fresh at the moment; very easy to make, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is really awesome bread. I've made it a couple of times now, following the recipe exactly. It really isn't a batter, but a regular bread dough, so I use my KitchenAid and dough hook as I would any other bread. The first time I used the recipe I made pizza dough out of it...SO GOOD!

This bread was very good and easy to make.  Like another reveiwer suggested, I used basil pesto in place of the basil.  I think next time I will also add chunks of garlic and try making breadsticks or rolls instead of a whole loaf.

Delicious!  I only used about 1/4 c. sun-dried tomatoes (because that's all I had on hand), and there was plenty of tomato flavor.  I don't think you need to use the full 1/2 c. in the recipe.

I also had trouble pureeing the basil in my blender with so little liquid, so next time I'll try using a food processor instead.

Awesome bread! Mine took a little longer to double in size both times (more like 45 minutes) and took only 30 minutes to bake. This will be great dipped in some tomato cream sauce!

This was terrific! I made it with the Tuscan Bean Soup from this site. The one thing about my bread was it was done baking about 15 minutes before the rquired time.`

I made a few minor changes: half chopped kalamata olives, half chopped sundried tomatoes. I used the olive oil from the sundried tomatoes as my olive oil so it still has a good sundried tomato taste. I omitted the salt due to the amount of salt in the olives and tomatoes. I used half whole wheat, half AP flour and I tripled the recipe for 2 large loaves. I had no fresh basil so I used 1/4c dried. All in all, delicious. I probably could have added the salt after all, without any harm.

This was an easy first bread to make. I had fresh chives and basil from my window box that I chopped up and baked into it instead of the tomatoes. Came out great.
