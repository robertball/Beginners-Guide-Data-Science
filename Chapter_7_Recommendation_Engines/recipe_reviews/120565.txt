So yummy! I was looking for a sweet potato recipe without alot of added sugar and my hubby and I thought this was really good (although I might reduce the sugar a bit next time).  I used tin foil in the bottom of my baking pan and am so glad I did as everything caramalized into a very sticky mess.

Very tasty! Definitely sweet with a nice touch of spice and a little kick from the cayenne - not your average sweet potato...  You can adjust the cayenne to your tastes and watch your cooking time. These potatoes were done in about 30-35 minutes.

It exceeding our expectations (even our 1 and 3 year old loved it). I used half of the brown sugar and put in a 1/2 tsp of curry powder instead of Cayenne (I was out of Cayenne).

The best ever.  Was so enjoyable.  I found they only needed to be in the oven for about 30 mins... they cooked very fast.  I lowered the temp at about 25 mins to 200 and waited until my food was ready.  They were perfect.  I just like to add these did not come out crunchy if thats the taste your looking for.  YUM!

AMAZING! I was looking for a sweet potato recipe that wasn't sweet. To kick it up a notch, I used 1 minced hot pepper instead of the dried or ground stuff. I cut the sweet potatoes into smaller chunks and left the skin on so it would cook faster (ready in 30 min) and have more fiber. I will definitely make this dish again!

I love the fact that this recipe is slightly spicy!  The slight heat lends so much to the sweet potato - they go perfectly together.  I do add a vidallia onion and some fresh rosemary to the mixture.

I absolutely loved these, I think next time, I will reduce the amount of oil and turn on the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes to make them crisp.

This was delicious. I doubled the recipe and used half yams and half regular sweet potatoes and it turned out great. All of us enjoyed the yellow sweet potatoes best, so I will probably just use those next time.

Great side dish with just enough kick!  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  I did line the baking dish w/ foil to make clean-up easier!  Thanks for a super recipe!

These potatoes were delicious! I really loved the unique combination of sweet and spicy. I left the skin on, and lined the pan with tin foil. I also found the 40 minutes a bit too long, took them out at 30 minutes. Will definitely be making this again!

This is my new favorite way to fix sweet potatoes.  I loved the spicy, sweet flavor! I needed to add a little more salt at the end, but other than that, these potatoes were perfect!

Great taste, but you really have to keep an eye on them in the oven ~ when they start to burn on the bottom they go fast! Also absolutly use foil lined pans, even if the pans are non stick!!!

This was very good, the word yummy comes to mind. I used all the ingredients except I substituted turbinado brown sugar and used black pepper instead cause I didn't have white, the cooking time I changed; about 20 minutes into the cooking time I smelled a burning smell and it was the sugar causing the potatoes to darken, it only took 20-25 mins. to cook and I even reduced the oven to 350. Thankfully it added to the flavor and the dish was great and tender. As a suggestion to make it even healtier reduce the oil and sugar.

This was a very tasty dish, good for thanksgiving and christmas dinner...It put a different spin on things, aside from the normal candied yams we have each year. However, a few suggestions: First, I used butter instead of oil, as it gave it a richer flavor. Second, I cut the potatoes a bit thicker than 1 inch...probably 2 inches, as I enjoyed more of a texture than the 1 inchers could provide. Third, if you are going to put marshmallows onto this dish, you need a more extensive amount, as only a few just cooked into the dish (though it made a wonder candy coating!). I omitted the pepper, though it was good...but just wasn't for thanksgiving. Both ways are good in different ways, though!

My guests loved this dish!  So simple to make.  My modifications were the result of not having enough sweet potatoes: I had to use one large red potato (with skins) which did not disrupt the dish's flavor (may have added some eye appeal). I also lacked the cayenne pepper so I substituted chili pepper (cayenne would have added a little more 'heat' to the dish which I would have liked).  I must admit I liberally greased the pan with butter!!  Yum yum... My wife wants me to make it for her and my daughter again, and soon!

I followed the recipe exactly.  These were delicious.  My whole family loved them!  My 4 year old dipped them in sour cream because she thought they were a little spicy.  This is my new favorite sweet potato dish!

Excellent change from sweetened sweet potatoes.  I chunked an onion and tossed it in with this recipe and left out the brown sugar altogether.  Yum.  This will be a keeper.

OK, The 5 stars are because the people at the Easter dinner I took this side dish to all loved it (or at least said they did)! I wasn't that excited but probably not the fault of the recipe. The recipe is for 8 servings and I needed a dish for 12 people. I had almost 5# of yams and it made a very full 9x13 pan. I tripled the ingredients  called for but when it was baked I couldn't feel any of the heat and I'm a wimp about hot stuff! I do like candied yams but this was a nice change and will make it again. I will add more of everything even if it is a small dish for "8". BTW..... Took a lot longer to bake too!!

I was baking something else and so couldn't turn the oven up as high or bake the potatoes for as long as the recipe specifies, so I blanched the cubed potatoes briefly, then drained them and tossed them in a large bowl with the olive oil/brown sugar/spices.  That worked really well because everything melted and thoroughly coated the warm potatoes without much effort from me!  Then I only needed to bake them about 30 minutes at a lower temperature.  Excellent recipe.

wonderful, simple and quick to do. It was tasty, the sweet potatoes didn't come out crunchy but i was fine with that. Sweet and with a slight kick to it.
I found the recipe/ spices in perfect proportions- the heat didn't overpower the sweetness of the potatoes and the sugar.

I love sweet potatoes and have a similar recipe that has no sugar at all but with spices like this.  This one was good too; i cut back on the sugar a bit because hubby likes the spicy flavors better.  The combination of sweet and spice is really good.  They took about 30-35 minutes to cook, so it was a nice side dish for a week night.  Thanks for sharing!

Addictive.  Oh my God.  Increased all quantities a bit, had to sub white sugar since I was out of brown, and still was tempted to beat my family off it so I could eat it all myself.

These were a big hit - I didn't put the cayenne pepper in; I was afraid it would be too spicy for our young kids.  Make sure to line your pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up!!

YUM!!!  These were delish!!  Brought them to a friends' for a cookout and both couples raved and asked for the recipe.  I did find, as many other reviewers mentioned, that 40-45 minutes was way too long, as my potatoes tasted amazing but they turned mushy.  They also do not crisp up.  Next time I will try baking them for 20-30 or so (just until tender) and then place them under the broiler for a few minutes, flipping once, to brown all sides.  While we LOVE spicy, they are a smidge spicy for kids, so I would do a tad less cayenne next time, but not much less.  The heat is near perfect!

Excellent recipe if you want something different that the usual sweet potato casserole.  I usually add more cayenne as we like our food on the hot and spicy side.

This recipe is a perfect and healthy alternative to the typically unhealthy casseroles for sweet potatoes! No complaints or suggestions--it's great as is!

I have made this recipe several times now, it is hands down my husbands favorite.  The heat of the cayenne and the sweetness of brown sugar play off each other well.  My husband is on a strict low sodium diet, so I omit the salt all together and it is still delicious!

Yummy spicy mix.

I omitted the sugar and used a mix of sweet and normal potatoes.

I used chilli seasoning, cayenne, minced chillis, minced garlic and minced coriander along with onion and garlic  powder. Had with microwaved salmon and steamed broccoli. God quick meal and so healthy.

A wonderful savory twist to sweet potatoes.  I broiled the last 5 mins. to caramelize the top. So fantastic.

This is a great receipe. The sugars come out of the potatoes and mix with the brown sugar to caramelize the potatoes nicely. I cooked this dish amidst home renovations with all my spices tucked away, so I used just an all in one chilli spice in place of the chilli powder and cayenne pepper. I cooked them at 375 on convection bake and they only took about 20 minutes. A very yummy side!

This recipe was a little sweeter than I was hoping for, I have been making something similar to this for years.  I cut the sweet potatoes ( use the more yellow than orange variety) coat with a little spray olive oil, garlic pepper,salt, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes.  I cook them at a high heat until done to the right crispness, about 20 minutes at 450.

This is a great way to try sweet potatoes that have a kick instead of sweetness.  I used some dried and some minced pepper and increased the amount because I like my food especially spicy.  For the same reason, I reduced the amount of sugar.  Still delicious!

I just made this, and I have to say, it is my new favorite way for sweet potatoes.  I did change it just a little though.  First, I added a sliced green pepper and 1/2 slice oniot to the bag when I mixed it with the spices.  Then I sprinkled a little extra of everything on top before I put it in the oven.  I left the skins on like one other member recomended, and I cooked them on a foil lined cookie sheet so they would be a little crispy.  Yummy, Yummy, and did I say Yummy.

These were good, and very easy to prepare.  I followed the directions exactly, although when I reheated a bowl for myself later on I added some more chili powder and liked that flavor a little more.  The spice in these is subtle, and you're still  going to get mostly a sweet potato taste, so if you're looking for something a little more palate-shocking, this probably isn't it.

These were all right. I probably halved the recipe, because I didn't have so much potato, and used it on both white and sweet, but the potatoes turned out soggy, even though I followed the recipe. The only difference was I didn't use cayenne, just extra chili powder. I probably should have used the cayenne because the chili powder wasn't very strong (for me) by itself and the potatoes didn't have asm uch flavor as I would have likedc. Probably would have helped if they were crispy! Next time I may not even use the olive oil.

Love this recipe-it was so easy and a nice alternative to your typical "sweet" potatoes.  I also added a splash of hot sauce because I was out of chili powder-it gave the potatoes a nice kick without leaving my mouth on fire!

SO GOOD! Made it a couple of weeks ago with a turkey meatloaf and I'm making it for Thanksgiving! I think it'll be a nice change from the sweet potato with marchmallows that nobody eats!

The sweet potato was caramelized very nicely by the brown sugar and the spices worked very well.  I thought the balance between sweetness and spiciness was just right.  If you want to "spice up" your sweet potatoes then give this recipe a try.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish. Next time I will cut the pieces even bigger - I cut them pretty small, and they were a bit mushy. Overall, an excellent flavor combination!

My husband loves sweet potatoes and this was a big hit.  The chili powder gives the potatoes a subtle heat, which is pleasant with the sweetness.  I served it with plank-grilled salmon and it was terrific.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't too impressed with the result.  None of my guests complained or anything, but no one raved either.  Definitely add some garlic salt or salt and garlic powder.  By the way, if you are looking for spicy, these are not the potatoes for you.

YUM!!!!!!!  I lined my baking dish with foil for easier clean up and then I went light with the chili powder and cayenne pepper because we were feeding a crowd for Easter.  These potatoes got RAVE, CRAZY LOVE reviews from everyone.  I believe I was told about 30 times to only make sweet potatoes this way from now on.  BTW, I covered with foil for the first 30 mins. and then uncovered for the rest of the cooking time.  YUM!  Thanks!

i made this recipe with yams instead of sweet potatoes. no changes were needed aside from gently rounding off the spices (personal preference). my rock hard yams were cooked through right on schedule ~ in 45 minutes. serves well with cubed steak cheeseburgers. many thanks for your tasty potato recipe lynn!

So tired of every sweet potato recipe being loaded with marshmallows and piles of sugar!  This was wonderful.  Even my heat-phobic husband really enjoyed it.  Not cloyingly sweet, really nice.
I did put it on non-stick foil after reading others' comments, but didn't find any caramelizing, no sticking at all.
Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Really easy. In my oven needed the whole 40 minutes @ 400. Maybe because I kept the sweet potatoes in large chunks. Used full amount for just two sweet potatoes and turned out delicious! My husband says sweet potatoes aren't his favorite, but he liked them!

I have never cooked sweet potatoes before, but the reviews were great. This was amazing! It only took 30 minutes and the seasoning pleased all my picky eaters. I will make use a little less cayenne next time, though, as we don't like spicy things. Great recipe.

Used olive oil.  I didn't have cayenne so used 1 teaspoon chili powder and 1 teaspoon cinammon.  Also used 2 teaspoons brown sugar (not tablespoons).  They are delicious! Took about 35-40 minutes to cook.  I cut the pieces fairly small.

Personally, I thought this recipe was too sweet. I loved the spice, however, the sweetness was over barring. I am willing to try again, but will definitely cut down on the sugar.

These were so delicious!  The only complaint was taking time to peel and chop the sweet potato during the workweek.  I omitted the cayenne and added regular pepper. The chili pepper gave it a nice flavor. Also used splenda brown sugar mix and an omega3 mix oil.  Just keep and eye on them when cooking.  Mine only took 30 minutes and were perfect.

Wonderful.
I couldn't find sweet potatoes, so I used Japanese Yams instead. And instead of chili powder, I smushed so frozen thai chilis into the mix.
Baked for 40 minutes, raising the temp up to 500 for the last 5.

I've never been much of a sweet potatoe fan -- until now!  I can't get enough of this recipe.  And I've made it for many friends who also thought they didn't like sweet potatoes, only to rave about these.  Perfect mix of sweet and spicy and goes great with grilled meats, pork and poultry!

Absolutely loved this! I didn't measure any of the spices though, just kinda eyeballed it. You can add more or less of any of the ingredients to tailor it to your specific tastes. Line your pan with aluminum foil to make for a super easy cleanup!

We tried this recipe for dinner tonight and LOVED it!  The sweet balances out the spicy nicely. I have to admit that I kicked up the cayenne a bit (rounded 1/4 teaspoon) and wished I hadn't.  I love my food spicy, and I think I will stick to the original recipe next time.  These sweet potatoes will be a regular part of our dinner menu.

Thanks to Lynn T. London for the great recipe.  

Also, thanks for Tasha for letting people know they can use a container; instead of plastic.

Followed recipe as directed. The only exception was using a washable container.

A side note:  This is a side dish of sweet potatoes and is 5 ***** quality.

I really wanted something new for sweet potatoes.  This was awsome! ! ! I used chipotle insted of red pepper and the bit of smokeness was a great addition to the sweetness.  I served these with a honey mustered glazed ham.  Thanks

I used this idea to make another version of spicy sweet potatoes. I used 2 cans sweet potatoes, 2/3 c. brown sugar, 6T butter, 6T flour, 2T Dole pineapple orange juice, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. I also topped with chopped pecans. This was delicious and not too sweet! Marshmallows will be optional for next time. :) Thanks for the spicy inspiration!

Good, had to cook longer than stated, so I had my main meal done. Could have been because I cut them thicker?!?! I thought I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks.

I used the basic recipe as a springboard and emptied out my spice cabinet on this one. Next time I will microwave my potatoes first to make them alittle softer and roast some hot peppers in with the potatoes.  I served them with BBQ's pork chops and a veggie.

After reading all the previous reviews, I wonder if my expectations were a little high.  I thought this dish was just kind of ok.  If made in the future, I will stick with the traditional spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.

Considering that I don't care much for sweet potatoes, this was a nice, incredibly simple and healthy way to serve this veggie. Cut 2 potatoes into chunks for two of us and had just a small amt left over. Will use this one again!

These were good but mine came out slightly mushy- I think it's because I was in a rush when I was making them and wasn't able to really pay attention to time. Got lots of compliments though- loved the flavor because it was something different than "sweet" sweet potatoes.

Delicious!  I also added some freshly ground black pepper and cinnamon to the potatoes to give them a little more flavor.  Loved the spicy sweet flavor.  I cooked them on a baking sheet sprayed with olive oil spray and didn't have any problem with them sticking.  Clean up was easy.  I will make them again soon!

This is now one of my favorite side dishes!  I love the flavor of the spices with the sweetness of the potatoes.  I lined the pan with foil for easy clean-up, but that's the only change I made.  I highly recommend!

Oh yum. These are amazing. I also use the spice mix on normal potatoes, which goes really well with fish dishes. This is in my regular side dish rotation.

I used chipotle chili powder and it added a great smoky note. I will use less oil next time.  I tossed on the cookie sheet rather than in a bag so all the oil and spices stayed on the potatoes.

I thought this was very good; the combo of slightly spicy with slightly sweet was great.  It seems like it could do with a little something else though.  Maybe a little carmelized onion? Or a little sticky-sweet, like honey or maple syrup? Still, it's very tasty and I will definitely make this again.  I'd like to see what other people come up with as far as customizing this recipe.

Perfect combo of sweet and spice.  Delicious and will definitely make again.  I did need to adjust the oven temp and time but I have a very hot oven.
