I made this for dinner tonight and served it with a sour cream and feta cheese dipping sauce.  I did add some onion powder to the pepper sauce, cut the chicken amount in half but kept the amount of the sauce the same. I served it along with a salad with Asaian cucumber vinaigrette and bleu cheese.  I was surprised it  wasn't as spicy as I expected.

Great recipe. I served some as written and some with the sauce on the side for dipping. The sauce is really good over rice and veggies too. :-) Thank you for the recipe.
