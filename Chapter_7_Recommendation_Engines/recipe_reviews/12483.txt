Wow!  I made this for Christmas...soooo tasty.  I really love walnuts, so I added 2 cups of walnut halves (not chopped).  Pie was heavenly, and everyone commented on how it had the consistency of pecan pie without being sickeningly sweet.  Definitely better when warmed!!!

Oh yeah, these are good.  I made small ones in a muffin pan and baked them only for 25 minutes.  I should have made a double batch, because when they were gone, people still wanted more.

Tasted excellent. I didn't have a full cup of corn syrup so I used what I had, which was a little over 1/2 cup. I feel that using less corn syurup made this pie "not so runny" so I suggest to Mrs. Angulo to use less syrup and that will definitly firm it up. Great taste and not too sweet.

We used this recipe for our family Christmas potluck.  It was a hit with those that love pecan pie or fudge.  I had to substitute unsweetened chocolate for the semi-sweet chocolate and increase the amount of sugar, but it was great.  Half of a normal piece of pie was just the right size -- it was very rich!

This pie was great! Mine turned out interesting because the chocolate rose to the top, and the caramely filling sunk to the bottom making it half of each, which was great actually! We used pecans instead of walnuts, but I think walnuts would be appropriate because it ends up tasting like a brownie on top, and pecan pie-filling on the bottom. Very rich, give it a try.

I changed this recipe and it turned out great. I was just playing around and lucked out. I only used 1/3 cup karo. I added 1/3 cup coffee liquor. Since the quanity of the filling is reduced I should have used a regular pie shell instead of deep dish. Also much better flavor on day 2.  This one is a keeper for us.

WOW! Just wow. I was looking for a way to use up a ton of chopped walnuts that were given to me. I figured this would do the trick, but I didn't expect to like it better than a pecan pie. And I usually love pecan pies above all others. This was excellent! I used an Amish "Pat in Pan" pie crust and the crumbly texture was perfect with this walnut pie.

I made this in a 10" springpan with nut crust, cooked 35mins - turned out very yummy.  Next time I might add more chocolate :)

What a rich pie this is.  Too rich for me actually.  But, I do like the texture of this one; "gooey cake" is the best way for me to describe it.  I did have to bake it much longer than the directed time because it would have been chocolate soup otherwise.

While this pie was delicious, I didn't realize I was essentially making pecan pie until it came out.  I guess the "move over pecans" description should have clued me in.  I served this pie with cool whip topping and got many compliments.  Very rich and delicious!

Fantastic!  The only change I made was a little less corn syrup (3/4 c. instead of 1 c.), and a little more semi-sweet chocolate.  I used chips - much cheaper than baker's chocolate!  5 Tbl. of chocolate chips = 2 ounces.  I also used the Amish pat-in-pan crust.  It held up very well, and is super easy and fast to make. 
 Outstanding!  I served with unsweetened heavy cream poured on top.  Perfect.

This was a giant hit at thanksgiving and I had requests to make it for Christmas as well. The only changes I made was that I used real butter and I used 12 ounces of ghiradelli dark chocolate chips instead of what the recipe suggests. If you are a chocolate lover this is for you.

Great pie. I only went looking for this recipe because I had no pecans, but it is so so good.

I had no corn syrup so I used the same amount of agave syrup and no sugar. Normally, to substitute, you use half as much agave as corn syrup.  

I doubled the receipe because I had a 9" deep dish pie. It was maybe a half cup too much, but no one seemed to notice the  overfill... 

A real hit.

The inside is a little too runny. I tried making it twice and both times it was messy, but sooooo tasty. My husband thought regular pecan pie was his favorite until he tried this pie! Now if I can figure out how to firm up the filling...

It really does have a good taste. It's so compact with nuts and corn syrup though so I'm not keen on devouring it. Still ok for me anyway.
