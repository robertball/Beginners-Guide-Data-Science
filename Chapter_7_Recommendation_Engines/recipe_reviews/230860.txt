On the surface it doesn't seem like this would be anything special...but it was.  Not too boldly flavored, but not too plain or wimpy either.  Just perfect in my mind (tho' I did use regular, long grain converted rice), and I loved the additions of the red pepper and mushrooms.  Hubs called this "a work of art."  And speaking of Hubs, in consideration of his sensitive innards, I left out the red pepper flakes.  I doubt we could have enjoyed this more had I included it.  An excellent choice paired with chicken, fish or other seafood.

This rice recipe was a wonderful change from plain rice. I used my food processor to chop up the veggies so this was easy to prepare. I liked the flavor the chicken stock gave the rice and of course adding mushrooms always makes rice taste better.

Deeeeeelicious! Eating it as I type. I used red onion because I had one huge yellow and three small red. The only thing I will change next time is less stock. I also added some fresh parsley from my garden for the pic. LOVE the mushrooms in it!!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  A great alternative to plain rice.  We added more mushrooms than recipe called for so reduced the amount of chicken stock.  Didn't boil for 10 minutes as recipe described. Instead brought to a boil and then reduced to low heat for 10 minutes. Will make this one again!

This was very good!  I followed the directions exactly, using a boulion to make the stock.  I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand but loved the red pepper flakes, it gave it a bit of zip yet not too hot or spicy!  Great quick recipe with the use of instant rice.

Tried this last night. I modified to fit what I had on hand meaning I don't use instant rice. I only used 1/2 roasted red pepper, added 1 small zucchini diced. Did everything else according to instructions but threw it all in the rice cooker with the chicken stock to cook on its own. Was perfect with grilled salmon. Would go very well with shish kabobs or anything else really.

This was a nice side dish to our dinner of: 'Southwestern Egg Rolls' and 'Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce' both from AR.  I did omit the mushrooms, due to personal taste, but kept everything else the same.  My guys are huge rice eaters and they both really liked the dish.  The next time I would like to try this with long grain rice as opposed to the instant rice.

I was so excited to try this as the main picture looks delicious. This was pretty bland and boiling instant rice for 10 minutes turned the rice to mush. This was a let down and a waste of ingredients.

Loved it! I used the crushed pepper flakes to taste b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy. Really nice flavor and super simple to make. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This rice is fantastic!  My family really enjoyed it.  I love flavored rice dishes and the flavors of the mushroom, onion and garlic with the hint of heat from the black and red pepper flakes just wakes up your mouth.  I added basil and a little oregano.   Great recipe, I will definitely make this again!

Oh ya. Good stuff. Of course I put stuff in that I had around. 

Cooked brown rice, 3 smoked poblano peppers in some sauce, mushrooms, 1/2 small yellow pepper, 1/2 onions. Garnished with a scallion. 

Cooked rice and added all veggies. Whooo hot and good.

Tasty meal. Everyone loved it. I didn't have instant rice so it took much longer to cook, but it was worth the wait.

Pretty decent but cut the salt back and maybe add veggies as picture shows
