I brought some in to work for a friend of mine (who happens to be a gourmet cook) to taste.  She said it was fabulaous & one of the best pasta salads she'd ever had.  I used whole wheat shells and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I think it would be good with whole wheat angel hair pasta & I'm going to try adding some broccoli florets cut up & a little grated carrot for color next time.  Shrimp would probably be a nice substitute for the chicken as well.

I gave the original recipe as written 3 stars; but 4 stars with adjustments and additions I made to “jazz” up the salad. I boiled tri-colored rotini pasta in salted water. Chopped up some leftover rotisserie chicken and set aside. For the dressing, I used 3T low-sodium soy sauce, 2T sugar and 3T white wine vinegar. I seasoned the dressing with Hawaiian sea salt, black pepper and some fresh grated ginger. I also put about 1T of toasted sesame seeds to the dressing. Instead of veg/canola oil I used 2 T of sesame oil for flavor; and, fresh cilantro in place of parsley for another layer of flavor. Once I drained the pasta, I poured half of the dressing over it and chilled in the refrigerator for 4 hours. I tossed in fresh baby spinach, chicken and the remainder of the dressing. This needed some color and texture so I added sugar snap peas, carrots, julienned, and cherry tomatoes, quartered. I garnished with green onions, sliced, more cilantro and a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds. This was the most delicious and hearty pasta salad-perfect for a hot summer meal!  The dressing has the right amount of soy sauce, sugar and vinegar-not too sweet or too tart. The pasta soaked up the dressing giving it lots of flavor. It’s a very colorful salad full of chicken, greens, vegetables and fresh herbs. The addition of cilantro, ginger and sesame oil gave this the “Asian” flavor I wanted in the salad.

I tried this over the weekend to accompany our BBQ and this was excellent.  It could even be the main course as it got the most compliments of anything else served.  Nice and fresh and perfect for the hot day we had.  You may want to double this recipe, I did and it still went quick.

YUM.  I was put in charge of brining a salad to a weekend BBQ and I got the most compliements of the day with this one!  I did add some water chestnuts for some crunch (without changing the flavor of the salad). I will be making this time and time again this summer as I am sure everyone I gave the recipe at the BBQ will.  This can be served alone as a main course too.

Delicious!  I didn't have white wine vinegar, and the store I shop at does not carry it, so I used plain white vinegar, it was still delicious, though I'm sure the white wine vinegar would have been even better.  I added a few chow-mein noodles for extra texture.  I am only giving the recipe 4 stars, becuase I do think its lacking something.  Grapes?  Strawberries?  Pineapple?  Not quite sure which extra ingredient would make it perfect, but it could use just a little extra "zing".

Good, but needs more veggies!  I scaled the recipe back to 3 servings and it still made alot!!  I added fresh picked grape tomatoes and didn't add the full amount of spinach.  There seems to be too much dressing, but after refrigerating the pasta  absorbs it.  Next time I will make extra dressing and pour on the salad before serving.

This was pretty good, especially served cold the next day; I had a bunch of random ingredients and no clue what to do with them, and this was perfect for cleaning up my fridge!  Thanks.

This is a delicious recipe; it does need the "crunch" of celery or water chestnuts, as others have suggested; but BEWARE! This recipe is NOT prepared in 30 ins. as stated - you need to chill it for 6 hours - not obvious from the time frames listed at the top of the recipe page. Make sure you have time...

This was just ok. I made it with shrimp as someone else suggested and whole wheat pasta. I think my parsley was a bit sour. Something just didn't taste quite right.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and did not care for the result. The soy sauce dressing turned the chicken and pasta brown and just looked unappealing.

This was very good. I used radish greens for the spinach and it worked great. They were pretty mature so I cooked them with the sesame seeds to eliminate their prickliness. I also used spaghetti instead of radiatore. This would be even better with a few more veggies.

When I first made this, I found myself wanting to make it Italian style, e.g., add basil, tomato, olives ... that sort of thing.  So, I pushed and went decidedly Asian in flavor:  Cilantro, rather than parsley, added shredded carrot for color, and edamame.  Used rice wine vinegar rather than wine vinegar and even a touch of hoisin sauce.  To make it pretty, make sure to slice the green onions vertically, then chop.    This was really good.  I just keep on thinking about that Italian/mediterrean version.  I guess that's next (no sesame seeds then, right?)

This was really good - I didn't have the spinach or parsley so I used some yellow sweet pepper and fresh cilatro instead. I also used slightly less soy sauce and rice vinegar instead of white wine. My 12 year old son loves it and has made it his new lunchbox favourite!

This is an amazing salad!  I made it up this morning for dinner tonight and realized as I was making the dressing that I only had half the required soya sauce and it still worked out great.  I also used olive oil for the salad oil.  I'm making this for a potluck this weekend!

Bf said he would like this better with Italian dressing.  I thought that it needed more color--when all the pasta and veggies are added, it's just white and green.  So I added some tomatoes for color, and tossed in sugar snap peas and some parmesan cheese just for the heck of it.  Bf also decided he wanted to add pepperoni to the salad.  We didn't have any defrosted, but we did have some crumbled bacon and that seemed to satisfy him.   It makes a ton, and I normally wouldn't have made the full recipe but I have a lot of spinach and I had the requisite amount of cooked chicken already.  Not bad, but bf is only willing to try it again with major modifications.  Thanks for the recipe!

I brought this to a cookout and everyone loved it. A couple of changes made just based on what I had on hand were to use whole wheat penne pasta and rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I also cut back the sugar by 1/2 tblspn. It was absolutely delicious, and even better the next day!

Yummy!!!  I was looking for a non-dairy/egg/nut pasta salad for my son's(who has severe food allergies)party and this was perfect! My store did not have radiatore so I used bowtie instead.  I also added water chestnuts like the other reviewer suggested.  Great idea!!

Yummy! I took the advice of past reviews and added water chestnuts. The missing fruit had to be mandarines because that made it all the more better. would not have mix it all together because the spinach does wilt.(not sure if its because it is a local Okinawan spinach and not states spinach) I would just marinade the chicken, pasta (I used the colorful spiral ones), and water chestnuts...then I would spread it over my bed of spinach, adding some dressing as needed. Definitely an adult taste because my 1 and 3 yr old did not care for it. Will definitely make this again.

There are other versions of this salad that feature more seasonings and less acid that I've enjoyed more on this site. This isn't bad by any means, no one will dislike it if they like these flavors. Thank you for sharing :)

This was great for me and my husband but not for the BBQ we brought it to. It was not a hit. I used a different pasta that had a mix spinach of and regular. They liked the pasta but did not like the spinach. Next time I would omit the spinach, it wilts and does not keep well. That is what others said they would do. I thought the same thing.

I don't normally like pasta salad but needed a salad to take to a picnic & didn't want the usual.  This was very good, even my pickiest child liked it. I forgot to add the sugar to the dressing but didn't miss it.  Added some red pepper for color.  Will be making again next weekend for a bbq!

I'm giving 4 stars because top of recipe says 20 minute prep, 10 min cook and ready in 30. I put this together exactly as written (used rotisserie chicken) thinking it was a warm salad.  I purchased all the ingredients today and I wouldn't call it inexpensive. When I realized it needed 6 hours refrigeration it was too late. Served it warm and my 16 year old loved it. He said it was like Noodles & Co., a favorite of ours. Next time I will probably add a generous dash of ginger and garlic to the dressing. My husband and I are looking forward to the cold version tomorrow.

Wonderful flavor. I also added grated ginger, which I though I had seen in the recipe earlier but when I looked at it on my app it was gone. I as well, added snap peas and mini chopped sweet bell peppers and doubled the chicken. The recipe in the end had alot of liquid so next time I will cut back to not have so much, but it could be used as a marinade after!

It was the best salad on a hot day. Whenever  we have leftover chicken I will definitely make this again.

I cut the oil in half, added about a teaspoon of sesame oil and, just to lighten up the pasta salad a bit more, I used agave sweetener instead of regular sugar .  I also added cubed cucumber, grape tomatoes (cut in half) and cooked shrimps.  The salad came out delicious and so simple to make!  Enjoy!

I didn’t have any sesame seeds  and  I used shredded lettuce . Marinating  the chicken and pasta for a few hours really made the salad taste great.  We will be eating this often.  Thank you for posting!

I didn't have white wine rice vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  I also used Teriyaki Sauce rather than Soy Sauce.  Other than being a little too salty (and I excluded the salt in cooking), it was very tasty.  I would add some peanuts next time to give it more texture and flavor.

I did not make any changes.  Yuck!  The sauce turned the chicken and pasta brown.  Also, it is way too salty:  3/4 c. soy sauce?

This is a very tasty salad.  I was short on time and marinated it for only one hour before serving.  Then I marinated the left overs overnight.  We preferred the one hour marinade version because you could appreciated the taste of the soy and sesame.  Overnight the favors faded.

We made this yesterday as a last minute change for dinner; we were having company.  It is delicious. We had no walnuts so we roasted some almond slivers and added them.  It was perfect for a warm summer night.

very tasty.  I used a combo of baby kale and baby arugula instead of spinach.

Not our favorite. Husband liked it a lot. Kids did not. I added mandarin oranges to appeal to our children, but there was a weird after-taste and the vinegar content was too strong. It needed more color and probably needed to have the chicken cooked in the marinade/dressing.

Great flavor but just too salty.
