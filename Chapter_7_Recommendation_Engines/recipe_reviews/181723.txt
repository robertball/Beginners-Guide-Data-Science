I made this last night and it was a huge hit. My 13 year old daughter hates everything (even before she takes a bite!) and she ate the whole thing! I didn't have 3 of the key ingredients (green onions, bread crumbs or bisquick mix). I used two slices of bread that I tried to crumble up, about 2 T of regular chopped onion and just left out the bisquick mix. The patties were pretty mushy as a result, but after cooking in the skillet, they firmed up and were just awesome. The dijon mustard made it! Will definitely make again. So easy!

these turned out really well! I only had the regular Bisquick mix which worked fine and did not use as much bread crumbs as the recipe called for. I used up my left over cooked salmon and tweaked the spices by adding hot sauce and a lemon/herb spice thingie, a dash of salt and pepper and old bay seasoning..easy and tasty!!

Very tasty!!!  A little dry..  Not sure if it is the bisquick..  I know I didn't over cook them.  I will make again and try w/o that ingredient.

Good recipe! Used sundried tomatoes in place of green onions, added freshly grated fontina cheese, and citrus basil rub (Pampered Chef), and just ate patties no bun or anything on them. Cooked them in canola oil. Very yummy!!!
