I give it five stars b/c I like the way I made it.  I needed a low fat dessert for a party and thought this sounded good, but I was worried about all of the comments regarding a soggy cake.  For my first layer, I used a box of sugar free fudge pudding mixed with 1.75 cups of milk and 4oz. of lite cool whip.  For my second layer, I used a box of sugar free cheesecake pudding mixed with 1.75 cups of milk and 4oz. of lite cool whip.  Oh, and I used two candy bars.  I will make this again and a again b/c it is so light - will make a perfect summer dessert.  Everyone LOVED this "cake" - even non-dieters loved it.

I loved this recipe, but I made the instant pudding as if it were pie filling with half the tub of Cool Whip added.  The directions are on the box.  It made the whole thing a lot thicker since I can't stand mushy textures.  Over-all, it was so good and very easy to make.  It took be about 15 minutes and that includes cutting the cake up, too.  :0)

Yuck!  This tasted like chocolate and vanilla pudding.  I don't see what the big deal is about this recipe.  The flavors did not mesh.  I won't make this again.

May be a misprint but pudding mix on box calls for 2 cups ea - 4 cup total, not 6. I cut back even more using pie filling amounts. Topped it with whipped toppong and crushed candies and shaved chocolate. Looked as good as it tasted. Everyone loved it.

I wasn't really into this one.  It turned out very mushy.  By day two it was really runny.  I always seem to get that with instant pudding though.

I too made the puddings with less milk, following the pie filling directions.  A good dessert but best eaten the first day - the bottom cake layer was soggy after 24 hours.  Next time I will try it with toffee bars instead of Butterfingers; I think the flavors will blend better.

Very easy to make and went over well at the church dinner. It doesn't keep very well, though. After a day or two, it was kind of mushy.

I think this might be even better if you mixed cool whip into the pudding to make it more of a mousse.  I used 3 and a half Butterfingers.  It turned out pretty good.  I would suggest you make this just before serving so it won't end up soggy.

i made this dessert for my friends at work and they all thought it was very good, the only thing is that the angel cake was mushy, i believe that pound cake would have been better bc it's thicker but it tasted pretty decent
thanks...

This was a real easy recipe,  everybody liked it, but I think they liked it more than I did.  I didn't like the cake to get soggy,  but it was light and refreshing.

This isn't really cooking, of course, but mixing. Great for a quick dessert when in a hurry. Don't use six cups of milk. Use the four cups as written on the box. Six makes it too runny. You don't have to chop up the candy for the topping. Save some time and buy the candy already in tiny pieces. A real kid pleasing dessert.

Must be a typo: 4 cups (or less) of milk not 6! Why am I so intolerant of recipes with typos? GRRRRR.  Anyway recipe sounds like a quick trifle.  I'd use pound cake not angel food.  Angel food just too sweet for me.  Might try this if I were in a fix for a dessert.

I followed other reviews and used pie filling directions for pudding adding a 1/2 tub of cool whip to each flavor. used choc fudge and vanilla. used 4 butterfingers. got rave reviews at a potluck, not a drop leftover to take home.

Yumm!  We love this dessert and have made it using several different types of pudding (chocolate/banana is good).  We use fat free instant pudding and the end result is a very low fat and tasty dessert.

Good recipe, but you almost need to use 3-4 candy bars to make it noticable in the dessert.  Also, not a very good dessert to let sit out. Gets too mushy. But good for someone who doesn't have a lot of time, and needs something kids will like.

This recipie is really fantastic! I gave it to my kids for a party and they all loved it!  Especially the butterfinger bits. If you don't feel like chooping up candy bars, buy the Butterfinger Bites and it saves time.  Especially for working mothers.

I made this for 50 servings and all that was left was a small Styrofoam bowl! This is very good. I put cool whip in my pudding to make it more like a mousse mixture and it worked wonderful. You can turn this into a low sugar dessert, I did. I will be making this again.

I make this recipe in a trifle dish - it looks and tastes wonderful!  I have requests to make it every year for dh's work Christmas party.  I do purchase the Heath Bar pieces (already crushed) and I make the pudding according to the box directions.

I also used the pie filling instructions for the pudding.  It was good but it was lacking something.  Maybe something like Snickers would add a bit more.

I thought this was mushy, but everyone else who ate it loved it. I topped it with cool whip and Skor chunks. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it and neither could his family.

I made this for a dessert and coffee night and it went over well.  My husband especially liked it and was so glad we were taking home the leftovers! I made it with Heath bars instead of Butterfingers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used only chocolate pudding and layered it with Cool Whip and Skor candy bits instead.  I topped it off with more Cool Whip and candy. It was the first dessert to go at the cookout I brought it to; everyone raved.  Thanks for the idea!!  :)

Very tasty recipe that was easy to make. I added a layer of cool whip to the top before serving. Many compliments when I served it to coworkers.

Couldn't get much quicker than this.  Took this dessert to a work luncheon over the holidays and everyone just loved it.  One of the first desserts to be finished!

This is VERY good.  I topped it off with whipped cream.  My 3 year old loved it.

This recipe is very easy to make and really yummy!!  I added heath bar pieces instead, and it turned out great.  Doesn't taste too rich either.

Took it two occasions and it was a smash hit at both.  All adults! 14 at one and 11 at the other.

This was easy to make & would work for a gathering. I used the smaller size pudding box since it is what I had on hand. I imagine if the larger size is used it would be more like pudding with chunks of cake in it. It is not good as a leftover - way too soggy.

Just made it for Easter dinner.  Looks kind of weird but tastes good.  I'm going to have to add strawberry whip cream next time for a neopolitan effect.

Great recipe...I will definitely make it again, but switch up the pudding and candy on top.  I think fruity flavors of pudding would be very good.

Was very good for Christmad dessert.  Next time I will use Cook and serve pudding though, I like the taste better.

Used 1 3/4 cup whole milk for each pudding, sliced the cake, then layered it.  I thought it was pretty good, but had 12 people here for dinner last night and not even a third of it was eaten.  (And these are dessert loving people!)
Tried some today, and it was not soggy. Not sure if I would make again.

Took this recipe to a church potluck - everybody thought it was really good.  I topped it with a layer of cool whip and a few more crumbled Butterfinger.  I thought it could use even more candy to give it more crunch.  Yummy.

I love making things that are easily put together and don't require much time.  This is one of my favorite desserts and this recipe is too.

I made this for a cookout on Sunday.  About half of it was eaten, (and compliments received) but on Sunday, it was a runny mess that ended up in the garbage.
It was JUST ok.  Not worth the time, ingredients.  I was very disappointed.
I did add a few blueberry's on top which lightened the sweetness and added color.

I have taken this several times to family functions because it has been requested several times.  I tweak mine though, I don't like thin pudding, so I only put 1c milk with each pudding, with 1/2 of a regular sized tub of cool whip & about a quarter of a cream cheese bar.  Then layer as directed.  much better!  I see there is no pic, I wish I had took one, I just made it this morning!!

My family all love pudding, so this was a hit.  Unfortunately, there weren't enough of us to finish it in one meal.  The leftovers weren't as wonderful as the first time (soggy layer), but we still enjoyed it.  I also used the pie filling version of the pudding, rather than straight pudding.
