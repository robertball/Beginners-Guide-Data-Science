I only had two cider donuts to use so I reduced the recipe using one whole egg.  As much as I hate to admit this, I made it for breakfast, topped with vanilla ice cream and maple syrup.  What a fabulous way to start the day!

I didn't have cider doughnuts but I did use pumpkin doughnuts and it was fantastic.  I am sure with the cider doughnuts it would be great too.  I drizzled it with caramel sauce instead of the maple syrup and it was awesome!

I made this for a cat rescue potluck. It was easy to make and everybody liked it. We usually have a ton of leftovers at our potlucks, but people were scraping out my bowl when I made this.

Great use of stale apple cider donuts.  Next time, Iâ€™ll add a bit more half-and-half to make it moister and bake 10 more minutes to achieve a golden crust.

This was a quick and easy recipe, next time we visit the orchard, I'll grab and extra dozen of apple cider donuts for sure.
