I tweaked this recipe a bit and it turned out great!!  Instead of the canned cheddar soup, I used 2 cups of shredded Mild Cheddar cheese, mixed in 8 ounces of sour cream, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup, undiluted.  Also just before serving time, I threw most of it into a greased baking dish, put crushed cornflakes doused in butter on top of that, and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes or so to crisp up the top.  Fabulous!  Will make this again.  Very easy.

These were bland, so I called my friend who has a recipe that I had made before for these type of potatoes. So I added part of her recipe to it and what a difference this made. Wow. I added to this original recipe 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 green onion (diced),and 1 stick of butter. Wow, This gave it so more flavor.

It was a hit at the pot luck.  I did add 8oz. sour cream and 12oz shredded cheddar cheese.  It was really good. I will start making this one instead of making it in the oven. Thank you for sharing your recipe

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I tried a couple variations based on other's reviews.  I ended up with a mixture of the orginal recipe and other's suggestions.
I added 1/2 c sour cream, 6 oz. evaporated milk, 1 stick of butter, and 8 slices of bacon (chopped).  I omitted the sliced onion.  This final recipe got rave reviews.
**UPDATE-5/18/10**
I still continue to make this recipe when an oven or oven space is not available!!!  There are never any leftovers.  :)  In an attempt to make it more healthy, i made the following adjustments.  I used lite sour cream, skim evaporated milk, and omitted the french fried onion.  I replaced the bacon with 2T of "Tastefully Simple" Bacon Bacon.  even with these changes to my recipe, it got rave reviews.  I just love this recipe!!!!!

Good base recipe. I used 8oz evap milk, 8oz sour cream, 1 can cream of chicken, 2 cups shredded cheddar, 1 stick butter, also some paprika. Wow...it was good...and fattening. :-) Perfect for a holiday when oven space is limited.

I took the advice of others. I added 8oz of sour cream, a bit of cajun seasoning, salt, pepper and some 'extra hot' seasoning. I also added a can of golden mushroom soup, a can of cream of chicken soup, a small can of mushroom bits and twice the amount of the french onions. My crockpot runneth over LOL but the potatoes were all gonein no time at all. Excellent!!!!! 
Since then I have added ham cubes and bacon bits to it and it was an even bigger hit!

Just served this today at our company's holiday potluck and it was a hit.  They were creamy and tasty.  

I took some suggestions from others and added sour cream then diced some ham and added that to make it more of a main dish.  There's hardly any left!  I will definitely make this again.

This came out nice and creamy for me. (It wasn't swimming in cheese but it wasn't a thick lump either.)  While it's not a "wow" recipe for flavor it's a good basic recipe.  Served it at my niece's baptism and everyone enjoyed it.   Will make again.

Word to the wise: GENEROUSLY grease/butter your crockpot for this recipe.  I sprayed mine down with PAM  pretty well but obviously not enough because since then I have had to soak my crockpot 4 times before a scour pad could finally pick up the rest.  I also gave  it one star for taste.  Having a quick recipe and/or more oven space is something we are all looking for and therefore we sometimes cut corners.  For myself (my husband enjoyed the recipe), I felt like it tasted overly processed and that shouldn't be a surprise by viewing the ingredients--none which are fresh.  Using fresher ingredients would of made this taste a lot better and I could of felt better about what I was putting in my body.

It came out ok but not very good. I had a big lump of potatoes to which I kept adding more milk to keep it from being so lumpy. Still though, it came out to thick but a couple of people did eat it and like it.

This was very good, but I didn't do the recipe as is.  I took other's advice and added 8oz of sour cream, 8oz shredded mild cheddar cheese, a small can of mushroom tidbits, cajun seasoning, salt and pepper.  I would've liked to try one person's suggestion of golden mushroom and cream of chicken, but I'm thinking she meant in place of the cheddar cheese soup and I had already put them in....maybe next time.

I am planning to make these potatoes next week-end for a friend's graduation party to celebrate her Master's Degree and decided I'd better test them out first.  I also modified the recipe slightly: I added 8 oz. of sour cream, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 4 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and I added the entire can of french fried onions instead of dividing and using as a topping afterward.  These potatoes are AWESOME!

This was good in the slow cooker.  I used the recommendations listed in the comments.  I didn't have the cream of chick soup, and I think it would have been better with that.  needed salt  I used cheddar cheese instead of the condensed cheese soup.

I made these for the Allrecipes Allstars faceless crock-pot recipes challenge. The recipe basically makes a cheese flavored  "mashed potato" recipe not hashbrowns. They just start as hashbrowns. I bought a 3oz (larger bag) of french fried onions. I am glad I did, because they need the extra flavor. Instead of doing half, I just cooked 2/3 with the potatoes and did 1/3 on top. For the greasing the inside of the pot I used a butter canola oil blend. I am glad I did that, because that more likely added to the flavor to. The biggest issue I had is it is really salty! Although, it was somewhat expected with the condensed soup. I cooked the potatoes on low for 7 hours overnight.

I thought this was a tastey recipe that could be changed according to tastes with more spices. I loved that it turned out so well in the slow cooker. It was a good side for a dinner I hosted.

My husband & I were really looking forward to trying this recipe. Unfortunately, we weren't impressed with the results. The 1st time, we made according to directions. We both agreed, They Were Bland! Last night, we made another attempt. This time, we used: Campbell's "Fiesta Nacho Cheese" soup, a few dollops of sour cream, evap milk, French's onions, half bag of shredded chedder, a TBSP! red pepper flakes, garlic cloves and diced up a few fresh jalapenos from the garden. How could anything with So Many zingy ingredients turn out So Tasteless?!? Even with careful mixing, it had the look of vomit and was thin-tasting. I've had better tasting potatoes out of a box. May try 1 more time, using the cream of chicken a reviewer suggested...Otherwise, I am giving this recipe the boot!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I did as others had done -- used more shredded cheese.  This has been a big hit with everyone whenever I make it (since I found this recipe last year).  Thanks again!

Made this as directed except used one can Southwest Cheddar Jack soup instead of the plain cheddar, and added some grated cheddar jack on top at the beginning.  I also ended up doing this in the oven, because I ran out of time for the cooker!  I think doing them in the oven might help avoid the "mushy lump" problem someone had.  These were just great, the 9x13 pan was emptied.  I will definitely make again.

I love this super easy recipe! I have a large crock pot so I always double it. I sometimes substitute one pkg of hashbrowns with onions and peppers and/or a can or two of nacho cheese soup to kick it up a notch. It is always a crowd favorite. I throw it together the night before and then wake up to its amazing aroma in the morning. It would be great for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. Yum!!

I liked it, although it was a little bland. My husband wasn't thrilled with it. My daughter's boyfriend said it was fantastic. And there was none left. I followed the recipe exactly. Don't you think adding sour cream and cream of chicken soup makes it a whole other recipe as suggested? I can see where you can play with it, Nacho cheese soup, jalapenos, chopped green chilis extra cheese on top, etc. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I followed other's advice and added about a cup of sour cream and some shredded cheddar cheese. 
Everyone loved this dish and it was great since you could make it and not worry about it being ready too early or too late.  Several people asked for the recipe!

Everyone who tried this enjoyed it at my Christmas Eve buffet. I did add some sour cream and grated cheese based on others' recommendations.  I also added a liberal dousing of Old Bay seasoning for flavor. I cooked it on the low setting for 6 hours and it was plenty done. Kind of the consistency of chunky mashed potatoes.  Will probably make again.

This was just kind of eh. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor and could really have used something. Maybe some salsa or someting? I even used O'Brien potatoes (with onions and green peppers) and it was still pretty blah. Also, cooking this on high for four hours was way too much. The potatoes were almost mush by the time I got home.

I found this recipe to be too bland in flavor for my families liking. I docotored it up a bit by adding a can of cream of chicken soup, grated cheese (lots), sour cream and spices. This made for a wonderful taste

Not impressed! It was mushy and bland. I added a little chili powder and a few thinly sliced green onions, it still was far from good.  The edges from the crock pot were crispy so the sides was the only edible part.  I was really looking for a good crock pot potato recipe, this is not it.

I think this recipe is wonderful, and I think you, Renee. After reading the reviews, I took it upon myself to see about adding more 'something'. I do a lot of cooking not measuring anything...and just going for it. With that being said, I added a scoop of sour cream (looked like maybe 2/3 cup). I also added cut-up squares of a variety of cheese that I wanted to use before going bad. Then I saw that on the shelf, I had a small bag of real bacon bits...and I used all of that. And then, hoping it would be too much liquid, I added a can of cream of chicken soup. NOTE: I did use everything in Renee's recipe. I just added to it.

Our company said it was REAL good. I asked my hubby what he thought, and he said he won't change anything. Even my real picky son ate it (I was really surprised and happy :) )So, I guess it was definitely a hit. Thanks again, Renee.

I made this for Thanksgiving but had revamped the recipe using the tips from other reviewers. Having it in the crockpot freed up the oven for other dishes and made it super easy. Instead of cheese soup, I used 2 cups of shredded cheddar and I used more French onions than the recipe called for (I don't know exactly... the bigger container). I added 8 oz of sour cream and a can of cream of chicken soup. I also added a can of mushroom bits and a can of golden cream of mushroom soup. I also added half a stick of butter and some southwest seasoning. It turned out too spicy and too mushy. What I would do differently next time is use regular hashed brown potatoes, skip the mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup, and use half a cup of sour cream. Then I would season with salt and pepper to taste rather than the southwest seasoning. Maybe also use 3 cups of cheddar too. Went really well with ham.

I changed this up a little by using a bag of Ore Ida Potatoes O'Brian and they were wonderful. Such a big hit for Easter dinner. So easy...throw everything in the crock pot on high and walk away for 4 hours. Next time I plan on trying a bag of tater tots.

These are always a big hit.  I put a bag of shredded cheese in with them and sometimes jazz them up with a can of diced green chilis or sauteed onions.  I also ue 2% milk.

These were great.  I followed the directions.  I forgot to spray the pan first and it stuck bad.  Next time I will not make the same mistake.  I used cheesy french onions as that was all I had and it was great.  Will definately be a holiday favorite in our house.

Very easy to make, pretty tasty, too.  I plan on making it again but it lacks something to kick it up a notch.  I tried adding salt and pepper but it still needs something.  Next time I may try adding bacon bits or something like that.

I doubled recipe and made changes suggested by others. I used one can cheddar soup, one can cream of chicken soup, 3/4 cup of sour cream, 1 cup cheddar cheese and one full can of evaporated milk. I also added some garlic to potatoes for flavor. It was an Easter hit!

Delicious, with a few modifications: 

Replace cheddar cheese soup with one can cream of chicken soup (condensed)

Add 2 cups grated cheddar (I used a triple cheddar blend(

Add 8 oz sour cream 

Add diced green onion (I used the green ends of 5 bunches)

Add paprika 

Always a hit and incredibly easy!

I made this as is, and without the fried onions it would have been very bland.  I will make this again, but try to stir in some spices next time, maybe some corn too for texture.  I think it has potential.

I have made it several times for pot luck dinners. It is always a big hit.

I made this for 8 adults and the proportion was more than enough. Very easy and tastes great!

The first time I made this, I followed the instructions and it was REALLY bland. After reading other's suggestions; I added the shredded cheddar cheese, butter, and more seasonings the second time...it was a hit!

I make something similar to this but I use a jar of Queso Con Salsa, and I add sour cream. It gives it much more flavor, and I use two bags of hash brown, one regular shredded, and the kind with the peppers in it. Every time I make it, someone makes me write out the recipe for them. It's to die for, and super easy! FYI, make sure you thaw the hash browns ahead of time :)

I read several reviews and decided to use shredded cheese and cream of chic soup. I also replaced 1/2 of the evaporated milk with 8 oz sour cream. Not a drop left to put away. This will be a go to recipe

These were sweeter and less cheesy than I expected. I wouldn't add as many French fried onions as is says to. It all sort of turned out really mushy. I would make it again, but with a few tweaks

I tried this recipe, followed it exactly.  It was bland and horrible.  First time ever I've been disappointed with a recipe from this site.

This came out like cheese-flavored mush. I even did as some others suggested and added sour cream and shredded cheddar. I threw most of it out.

I usually do the first time by the book, but didn't on this one. Regardless it turned out really well with the changes. I only used a 5oz can of milk and then added the rest in shredded cheese. Did a can of cheddar cheese and potato soup (not cream of potato, potato), and leftover smoked ham from the holidays. It's very similar to what I do when I make it in the oven. It turned out great, and I think with just some dried spice additions it'll be the way I make this now. For a household of two, we put a hurtin' on this.

Tasted good - word to the wise, if you double it, make sure you have over 4 hrs of cook time. I took suggestions and added sour cream, green onion.

Used this recipe to bring to work for a side dish.  Fairly easy to throw together on short notice.  Kind of bland needs some salt and pepper at least, but otherwise good stuffs!

Wish I had read the reviews before making this.  While it's nice that it used the slow cooker, I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hrs and then turned to low... but it didn't even need the extra time... potatoes are plenty cooked.  It is very bland in taste.  Am taking to my sister's for Easter tomorrow and am thinking of stirring in salt, pepper & some Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Will definitely make it again but will try some of the additions folks have listed.
