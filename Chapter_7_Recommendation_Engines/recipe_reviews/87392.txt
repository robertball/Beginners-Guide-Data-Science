Awesome! I marinated a thinly sliced pork tenderloin for about 3 hours, then drained the meat reserving the marinade. Stir-fried the meat over high heat in a large skillet until nicely browned then added the reserved marinade plus some water to deglaze the pan (& glaze the meat!)
Served on a bed of thinly sliced cabbage that had been sauteed with onion in wok oil until tender (with a little dark sesame oil for more flavor). A bit of soy sauce was added to the cabbage right before plating.

Excellent dish, very easy and tasty.  For this recipe, I sliced up 4 pork chops and doubled the marinade with great results.  I added some extra ginger (big fan) and also saved some marinade to reduce and add as a sauce at the end.  

My Japanese mother-in-law has taught me a great trick for cooking meat like this.  It's best to cook in small batches that don't overlap in the (non-stick) pan.  After each batch, drain off excess oil and wipe clean with a paper towel.  This keeps the meat and marinade from getting to burned.  This works well for any meat that is cut into small pieces and saucy from a marinade.  Hubby says it was just like mom's cooking!!!

This is almost like the ginger pork in restaurants here in Japan, but the ginger flavor is not strong enough.  Next time I'll either add more ginger, or marinade for longer.  I only used 2 tbsp of oil but it still splattered everywhere.  I think I will just spray the pan with some oil the next time and cook the pork in its marinade (the sauce tastes so good on rice).

Definitely was better with a longer marinade. Really good, I just tend to rank 5 stars for the things that I taste in my dreams and wake up wanting to prepare more.

I loved this!  The flavors were delicate and it went well with rice.  You definitely have to be careful what else you serve so you don't overpower the flavor of this dish.

This is a great recipe!  I put it on top of thinly sliced cabbage and serve with rice.  Tastes just like it is from Japan.

Excellent! I knew I would love this as I grew up eating dishes flavored with Mirin, Sake and ginger. I doubled the marinade and added a little more grated ginger. I marinated the pork loin for about 6 hours before sautéing. I sautéed the pork on high heat stirring and cooking until brown and meat looked crispy. I cooked the meat in three small batches, drained the grease, wiping the pan clean with paper towel before adding the next batch of meat. The kitchen quickly filled up with the aroma of this marinade. This was quick and easy with wonderful results! The pork was tender and flavorful infused with the succulent marinade. Mmmm. The ginger is pronounced but it is not overpowering.  I paired this with hot rice, “Oriental Green Bean Salad,” and “Easy Bok Choy,” also from this website.

Hubby and I both loved this recipes.  I did , however, use probably 2x of the ginger it called for.  Be sure to use real fresh ginger root.  I grated mine.  It goes very well with steamed rice, steamed/boiled cabbage or lettuce. :)  Thank you so much.  I love the sauce as well.

Also, A word of advice if you are using cut up pork tenderloin.  It will work and very well, but make sure the strips aren't too thick.  With strips, the marinade needs to be stronger so the flavor would soak through.  If you don't have too much time to marinade it, be sure to beat it in a bag (tenderize) before hand.  I know some of us are trying to use the less fatty cuts, this tip and recipe is definitely good for those.

Delicious and tender. I added more ginger and doubled the mirin because my soy sauce is quite salty.
I marinated over for 24 hours, and put aside extra for sauce. Cooked extra hot and in plenty of oil as per instructions. :)

The pork was so tender! It absolutely needed double the amount of ginger and a little more soy. I served mine over a little bit of sticky rice and lots of shredded cabbage as suggested. Very nice.

I didn't have mirin, so I substituted using sake and a pinch of sugar. It was good, but because it doesn't produce much sauce, we found it a bit dry, even using all of the marinade.

Delicious! I marinated this for about 24 hours and it was amazing. I used a 2 pound pork tenderloin so I doubled the marinade. Next time I will triple it and reserve some to pour over rice when serving. I also used some of the leftovers the next morning for breakfast. I diced a little bit of onion with the pork and put used it in my eggs in place of ham. It was great!

This didn't have a lot of flavour. Kind of salty with a slight ginger taste but that's it.

LOVED this! I used a pork tenderloin, doubled the marinade and cooked in about three batches so as not to reduce the temperature too much when cooking. It took about 2 minutes to cook each batch as the skillet is so hot. I served this over white rice and with a red cabbage salad. Will make again!

Excellent  recipe. I substituted boneless chicken thighs because my family is not fond of pork, & it was extremely good. The only problem was not making enough so next time I make it, I have to double the recipe.

4.4.18 I had a pretty good-sized boneless pork chop that had been the freezer for a while, and that’s what I used for this recipe for two servings.  I made some mistakes in mixing up the marinade (too long to explain), the pork slices, were in the fridge marinating for about five hours, and this turned out pretty well.  Too late to take a picture, but next time I make this, I'll shoot a photo and post.  Nice recipe, think I’ll add some sauteed onion and  bell pepper the next time.

Delicious!  I used Kurubota pork, sliced very thinly for Korean spicy pork bulgogi.  Added more ginger, sliced some onions and added in the pan fry, and served with brown rice and steamed vegetables.  I also threw some chopped green onions on top and bought some grated ginger from the asian market nearby.  So quick to throw together on a weekday night.  Will try with chicken, but I'm sure I'll be making this recipe over and over!

My family and I really liked this recipe! Changes made: tripled the fresh grated ginger, added 1 large clove of garlic, chopped; doubled the liquid marinade ingredients, and added 1 Tblsp. agave nectar. Then I took about 2/3 of the marinade and sealed it up with the pork in a bag for 2 hours. Added 2/3 c. of chicken broth (low sodium), 1 Tblsp. good sesame oil, and 2 tsp. cornstarch to the REMAINING marinade. I only sprayed the saute pan, didn't use the oil in the recipe. After the meat was cooked, I threw in the reserved marinade. Cooked up saucy and so good! I would add a touch more sweetener next time. Excellent and no leftovers!
