My version of the balsamic glazed carrots is similar: toss the carrots with 2 T olive oil then roast in a 425 degree oven for 20 min or until carrots are done to taste.  Coat carrots with 2 T balsamic vinegar and roast for 2-3 minutes or until vinegar has evaporated.  I have found the addition of sugar to be unnecessary. I have passed this recipe to several people in the office and they all agree that it's terrific.

The carrots had a wonderful flavor; however, the saute cooking method took a LOT longer than 10 minutes.....and that was with the carrots cut in half lengthwise.  Next time, I plan to steam them, then I will finish them in a skillet with the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.

Wow...so simple & flavorful!  My tweaks: par-steamed (2 min) then sauteed in a little butter and olive oil...maybe another 2-3 minutes...finished w/equal amounts of brown sugar & good balsamic.  Exquisite!  Thank You!

Fantastic. I made slight changes. I first tossed the carrots in olive oil and sea salt then nuked for 5 min. Then sauteed on med high with 1 tbs Smart Balance, and the called-for amounts of brown sugar/balsamic vinegar. I sauteed until carrots were coated with a glaze. Perfect. And now the kitchen smells divine!

Thanks for the recipe.  The carrots tasted great!  Instead of baby carrots I peeled up regular carrots and sliced them in about 1/4 inch round slices.  Also, I used a little bit more brown sugar than what the recipe called for.  They taste great the next day too!

I thought these were great! To assure they were done enough I added water to my saute pan at the beginning and boiled the carrots for about 5 minutes, then drained them and returned to the pan to finish per the instructions. We thought that the glaze ingredients could be doubled. After reduction, there wasn't a lot of glaze and we would have liked to taste it more strongly. I didn't have any olive oil, so substituted butter, which worked very well.

Yummy way to cook carrots.  However, they need to be steamed first for a little...ten minutes is not enough time in the skillet.

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed these already.  These have become a family favorite.  We just love them.  I've also used this method with sweet potato chunks.  Thanks!

We thought this was pretty good. I used only 2c carrots and cooked them in only 2 tsp olive oil.  When they were tender, I only used 1/2 TBLS balsamic vinegar to 1 1/2 TBLS brown sugar. This way, no ingrediant dominated the others but rather, complimented each other well. Pretty tasty and would make again when in a pinch.

I made these on Thanksgiving as a nice alternative to honey glazed carrots.  They have a nice sweet but tangy taste.  To cut down on time and hassle I just used a bag of steamed carrot instead.  This ommitted the need for olive oil and they tasted great.

Excellent side dish for a roast!  I baked the carrots in the oven instead - at is much easier to leave them in the oven to do all the work.  I rubbed the carrots with the olive oil and baked in a foil lined dish at 400 degrees for 30 minutes; added the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar at the end and cooked an additional 10 minutes.  Easy and delicious (nothing extraordinary though).

This was okay.  Needless to say, my kids didn't like them, and my husband came home from the office late, so I fixed him "plain" carrots.  I didn't hate them, they were just kind of, well, carrots with a hint of sweet vinegar taste.  Hmmm, maybe just my taste though, I think I'm coming down with a cold.  Thanks Harry ;)

We like our carrots tender, but not cooked soft. This recipe is perfect. I followed instructions to the letter and the carrots were delicious. The recipe is so simple and delicious. What more could you want? The only reason to par-cook or steam is to make the carrots softer, a matter of personal taste. I must disagree with the reviewer who said the sugar isn't necessary, it balances the acid from the vinegar but still allows nicely. I served these as a side with Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast from this site. Dinner was a hit. This is my new favorite glazed carrot recipe. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

4.5 stars as I agree with others: steam, nuke or roast the carrots to begin with. Sauteing raw carrots in a skillet means constant stirring/monitoring, ugh. Anyway...I used regular carrots (peeled & diagonal 1/2" slices) then steamed for 10 minutes. I made the glaze seperately in a non-stick skillet adding 1 T butter. I have white balsamic I used. Added steamed carrots to glaze, sauteed & stirred for a bit. Dusted with fresh ground nutmeg/pepper & sea salt before serving. I liked the sweet with some tang. Used equal amounts brn sugar and balsamic. Even tho it's 'just carrots', I found them more interesting and tasty using this recipe. Thanks.

These got rave reviews from even the skeptical/picky at my office Thanksgiving potluck. This recipe is cheap and simple to make, yet looks, tastes and sounds (when you say it to another person) fancy! Instead of sauteing, I roasted the carrots in the oven and tossed them separately with the reduction sauce. In retrospect, a few scallions or garlic cloves roasted along with the carrots would've been flavorful additions.

I had high expectations for this one, since I love balsamic vinegar and brown sugar. But the carrots took much longer to cook than the recipe stated. I suggest steaming or roasting the carrots first. And marinating them for a while the juices marry before sauteing.

Needs some salt. I salted at the beginning of cooking and then at the end with some finishing salt. Really good and helped get the weekday meal to the table in 20 minutes. Can't tell you if they are good reheated as we gobbled them all up!

This was a nice twist to regular steamed carrots! The contrast of the vinegar and brown sugar was nice. I added red onions for some color and extra flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

These were THE best ever.  Did not have baby carrots so did a large dice of regular carrots.  Used much less oil and "Splenda" brown sugar with a good quality balsamic.  The type of balsamic used by others my contribute to their not likeing this recipe.  Will make this often and can hardly wait to get at them again.

I really liked this but my husband thought it was too much vinegar.  Instead of using whole baby carrots, to shorten the cooking time I julliened carrots, so they only needed 7 minutes.

I'd like to give this 4 1/2 stars.  My husband usually won't eat carrots, but he really liked these, even going back for seconds!  My five year old, though, generally loves carrots and really did not like these.  I think that next time I'll replace the vinegar with OJ for her and see if it goes over better.  We will definitely be eating these again!

I used regular carrots, peeled and cut into rounds.  I did steam them first, simply sauteing them for 10 minutes wouldn't have cut it ;).  It was easy, and tasty, and even the kids enjoyed it.  I'll make this again, but need to tinker around a bit with the ratio of balsalmic vinegar vs brown sugar.

Excellent! I cut regular sized carrots down to baby carrot proportions and it worked just as well. I've never sauteed carrots before, only boiled and/or mashed, so this recipe was a welcome change. Won rave reviews from everyone I served it to!

Incredibly sweet like a dessert.  I would scale back the brown sugar next time.  It also tastes very festive (read:  Thanksgiving).

These are pretty good! They took a while to get tender, but other than that, these came out great!

Simple but effective way to prepare carrots.  I would highly support the suggestion of pre-cooking the carrots unless you like them super crisp.  

I cooked mine in the microwave under plastic wrap for 3 mins prior to sautee.

I steamed young organic carrots.  In a sauce pan I then lightly heated the vinegar / olive oil (good brand) / and sugar until all was combined.  I then poured the glaze over the carrots.  It worked well and everyone enjoyed it.  I sprinkled the carrots with coarse Kosher Salt before serving.

Pretty delicious! Thinking about using this at a big family gathering as it did not disappoint. My only warning is to make sure you use the stated amount of olive oil, otherwise they brown...

These were AMAZING!!  The first time I made them I kept the baby carrots whole, and they just didn't cook right.  This time I cut them up into 1/4 in dime sized pieces and they turned out perfect.  It did reduce the cooking time a bit - sauteed for about 8 minutes with the balsamic vinegar/sugar mix in for about 2 minutes.  Definitely adding this to our staple side dish.

I really liked this recipie.  I steamed my carrots first as reccommended in several other reviews and only used about 1 tsp of olive oil.  I think next time I'll cut the vinegar down to 1 Tbsp, but was still very good.

These carrots are so easy to make, but they are delicious! Even my husband who claims he doesn't like cooked carrots liked them! I am thrilled to finally find a recipe for carrots that he will eat. My kids loved them too. Definitely a winner in our house.

I really liked these, but I think I'll start cooking the carrots first and then add the vinegar and sugar half way into the cooking to avoid burning the sugar. Very good.

Really good - it's much easier though if you bake at 400 degrees for 35 minutes.  The carrots come out very tender and you don't have to waste the time or space on top of the stove.

Flavor was good, but I wish I would have listened to my instincts and boiled or steamed the carrots first. I'll do that next time, though. Yum!

These were pretty good but did need to be cooked longer or buy the petite carrots.  The flavor was different enough and not too sweet.

Outstanding!!!!  Paired perfectly with the chicken and potatoes I had made, and while I LOVED them, my boyfriend was kind of disappointed that the carrot taste was nowhere to be found as the balsamic vinegar really shines through.  Only thing I changed was to steam the carrots before sauteeing them in the vinegar and brown sugar mixture.  Will make these again in a heartbeat - thanks!

We really enjoyed these - the balsamic vinegar along with the carrots was yummy!  I didn't have baby carrots, so I peeled regular carrots and chopped them at an angle into ~3 inch pieces.  Any thick chunks I also cut down the middle to make all of the pieces more uniform in thickness.  Then I tossed them with a little olive oil & salt and roasted them in a 425 degree oven for about 45-50 minutes (turning/shaking them twice).  I used the same amounts of balsamic and brown sugar (my balsamic was strong) and drizzled it over the carrots.  My husband, 4 year old son, and 2 year old daughter also enjoyed them!  Thanks for the recipe!

There was nothing great about this recipe.  It wasn't bad, but it's certainly not to-die-for.  The carrots remained firm and burnt because they were not in enough liquid.  I love balsamic vinegar and carrots, but this recipe just was not for me.

I was looking for a way to use up a bag of baby carrots, and normally I HATE cooked carrots of any kind. This sounded good, but I did make some changes -- I tossed the carrots in olive oil, sprinkled kosher salt on them and spread them on a cookie sheet in a 425-degree oven. After about 35 minutes (occasionally tossing them around) the started to brown up and roast nicely. I took them out, sprinkled some balsamic vinegar on them, and put them back in the oven to finish up for another 5-7 minutes. I didn't add any sugar,  and I do think the salt helped. I now will eat cooked carrots!

These carrots weren't very good. I generally love balsamic vinegar but they just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I made them for Easter dinner yesterday. Every one took a small serving to start and no one went back for seconds. I will not be trying this recipe again.

My family prefers their vegetables raw or plain for the most part, but they all loved this recipe and have requested it to be repeated often.  The carrots came out al dente, sweet/tangy -- they were just plain YUMMY!!!!

This recipe was moderate.  The carrots REALLY lack the flavor you expect from the mix of vinegar and brown sugar.  I agree with the rest of the forum that you need to boil the carrots till they are a little softer before you sauté them.  I had the left-overs for lunch today, they were better than the first time around because the vinegar and brown sugar flavor permeated the carrots.  Wolfgang said he liked them but I think he is lying.  I won't be cooking these again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is easy but the results are so tasty! The only thing that I did different was using honey instead of brown sugar. The only thing I would want people to know is that depending on how you like your carrots (mushy or still farily crisp)will effect how you cook it. I put it in a dish in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes while I was cooking another dish and they came out perfect my liking, still a bit of crisp to them.

I made these carrots tonight and they were absolutely delicious!  This will be my go-to carrot recipe from now on.  I used a 16 oz package of baby carrots and I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception that I added a about a 1/2 cup of water when I was first cooking them and put a lid on them so they could steam and cook for 10 minutes and once they were tender I then added the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.  I followed the measurements exactly as on the recipe but I added a bit of salt on them after they were done and feel that it complimented the flavor even more.  I think I will also try them some time without the brown sugar and see how that is.  I made them for dinner tonight with Mom's Best Pork Chops (also from this site), lima beans and fettucinne pasta.  It was a very delicious dinner!!  :)

I followed the suggestion of roasting the carrots in 2T olive oil for 30 minutes then tossing in balsamic vinegar and roasting another 5 minutes. Served with balsamic glazed drizzled over for fantastic carrots I'll make again and again.

These are great. I did change it the second time after discovering ginger carrots. 
I baked the carrots for 15 minutes at 400 degrees in a glass baking dish with a little oil. Meanwhile I mixed the vinegar (I used pomegranate flavored) and sugar with 1 teaspoon ground ginger and 1/2 teaspoon cardamom.  After the carrots were done I mixed in the vinegar sauce, stirred to coat and roasted for another 10 minutes. They were excellent.

I read the reviews beforehand and decided to skip the brown sugar since carrots are naturally sweet, and we added a sprinkle of pepper and salt instead. We cooked ours in the oven at 425 degrees, then added the balsamic vinegar and put it back in at around 350 degrees (because something else was cooking at the time). Came out pretty good. My man's a raw carrot-lover, so we opted to keep them relatively crisp. Made an easy side dish.

Had these tonight with chicken.  They were very good, my husband went back for seconds. Added a little more brown sugar then suggested.  Will make again.

I usually love anything flavored with balsamic vinegar, but for me this was too vinegary and just okay.  I think an added tablespoon of butter might have made the difference.  Unfortunatly, I did not read the reviews before hand.

So simple and easy! I usually have these lying around in the fridge and now can incorporate them as a veggie side at dinner. They get a nice caramelization at the end. Will make again soon!

These were very tasty, however, I too made a few changes. I used whole carrots, peeled them, and then sliced into quarter in rounds. I baked them at 425 for about 20 min and they were still slighty uncooked. I should have let them for just a few  minutes more. But recipe is great. Thanks!

I took another reviewers recommendation and steamed the carrots for about 8 minutes before sauteeing them till just almost fork tender. Flavor was quite good. I served these carrots with Orange Herb Roasted Chicken. I did add just a bit of orange zest, to compliment the chicken and I used butter instead of EVOO. I'll make these again.

I'm almost embarrassed to review this recipe because I changed it so much, but think others should know how versatile it is. After steaming the carrots first, I added onions and dill weed in with the olive oil to saute. The glaze was made using brown sugar (Splenda) and sun dried tomato vinaigrette salad dressing. This is really good and so easy - thanks for posting it.

As written these carrots were too sweet for us, also not cooked enough using the time given. The second time I made them I started by microwaving them with a little water for 4 min, covered. Then I drained the water off and put them in a skillet with: 1 T. olive oil, 2 T. balsamic, zest of 1 orange, and a dash of salt. I heated them through until the balsamic had evaporated.... delicious!

I boiled the carrots in one inch of water for about 15 minutes first, then I drained it off and added the vinigar and brown sugar (I used splendas mixed brown sugar)and let that simmer for about five minutes. It was perfect and everyone loved the flavor. I will use this often.

You MUST boil the carrots first!  I boiled them then added them to the sauce.  Hubby & I liked it...kids were 'ehh' about them.  My balsamic was strong so I needed more brown sugar and butter.  Play that one by taste as another reviewer mentioned.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I did what everyone else did and parboiled the carrots.  I mixed the balsamic and brown sugar according to directions, but my balsamic was very strong so I upped the brown sugar, added in a couple pats of butter and luckily I had a little (about a tablespoon, thanks to the kids leaving an "empty" container in the fridge) of OJ that I threw in.  I suggest to start with the recipe and then add to it as you need since balsamics vary so greatly.

Excellent recipe! I am not a glazed carrot fan and found myself and guests going back for seconds. The balsamic vinegar balances out the sweetness of the brownsugar nicely. I used equal portions of the two with great results. I also lightly tossed the carrots in olive oil and sea salt and roasted them in a 425 oven for 25 min. Then tossed them in the pan with some added  butter  with the brown sugar and vinegar..mmm also I threw in a cpl tsp of orange juice. I had a lot of carrots so I made extra glaze. These were a nice side dish,and different from the very sweet candied carrots. We loved them!

Very good, easy, and fast.  I made less, maybe about 1 cup of baby carrots, and just eyeballed the other ingredients.  The carrots were perfectly done (not mushy, not crunchy) and nicely browned after sauteeing 10 minutes in olive oil over medium heat.

This was a good variation to steamed carrots. I boiled them for about 2 minutes first and then followed the recipe.  I  used a pepper balsamic vinegar which gave it a subtle kick.  I also added a squirt of maple syrup.  Nice change for carrots, will make again.

A lovely sweet side dish to my turkey. My guests were convinced I had honey on the carrots. They loved them and they didn't last long on the dinner table either.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I've been using the usual vegetables for supper and wanted something different.  The only thing I added were wedges (broken up) of onion.  They got slightly carmelized along with the carrots and seemed to be a nice addition.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.

I boiled the carrots briefly, as suggested by others, then sauteed them, following the recipe.  Maybe this changed the final result, because the carrots were not "glazed" at all; the carrots absorbed the vinegar and the end result was less than spectacular.  Sorry!

I didn't have baby carrots so I used regular carrots and sliced them diagonally. I also boiled them for a coule of minutes before sauteying. Even my picky son loved them.  Good choice with garlicky mashed potatoes. Thanks for recipe.

Delicious.  I have made this recipe many times.  Once I added a little ground ginger and it was delicious.  I tend to cook the carrots a little more on the tender side too.

Great flavor. Made the following change: melt 1 tbsp butter in saucepan. Add olive oil. Add carrots and saute about 3 minutes.  Added about 3/4 cup water, enough to barely cover tops of carrots. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and start simmering. Add balsamic vinegar and increased brown sugar to one cup. Mix thoroughly and keep simmering til good and tender. Took about 30 minutes simmering for our tastes.

Very simple and a pretty good flavor.  However, I agree with some other reviewers that the carrots need to be steamed first, but this is a preference. I don't like my vegetables crunchy when they are cooked. I also used balsamic vinaigrette instead of straight balsamic vinegar. Nice recipe and something different!

sweet, but very tasty, maybe I will try a little less sugar next time.  i used coconut oil instead of olive and it added even more sweetness.  i also used frozen sliced carrots since i didn't have any fresh and it worked great.  i first defrosted them in the microwave for a few min.

Cut larger baby carrots in quarters lenthwise for faster cooking. Skipped the oil, cooked in a small amt of water, and slightly reduced the sugar. Def a make again.

This is awesome, although I agree with many other reviewers; either pre-cook the carrots or be prepared have to cook them in the oil a lot longer than 10 minutes.  I like them parboiled in a 1/4 c of water, with 1t ea dried parsley and rosemary.  The herbs stick when the carrots are drained and compliment the flavors of balsamic vinegar and sugar.  Shallots sauteed in the olive oil added before that sugar, are nice too, if you have them.

Really good!  I didn't think my fussy BF would like these but he said they were the best carrots he's ever had.  I did add a small squirt of honey because I was afraid he wouldn't like the tangy-ness, but it probably wasn't needed.  Oh, and I followed the suggestion to microwave them for 5 minutes first, good idea.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty and tender.  We love cooking with balsamic vinegar, but you have to buy a good quality vinegar otherwise it will taste too bitter.  We also used the sucralose/brown sugar blend to cut down on some of the calories, even though the amount of sugar is low...also because we added more than it called for.  The baby carrots that are pre-peeled and cut cook quickly.

This is our new favorite!! I didn't have "baby" carrots, so used regular ones and cut into semi-thin pieces. Par-boiled in water and then did the rest just as in the recipe!! Awesome! My non-carrot eaters now want these again and again!  Thanks for the recipe....

I loved these, but my boyfriend thought they "tasted weird." He doesn't really like balsamic though, and I didn't tell him that it was in the recipe :P So I guess he unknowingly kinda picked it out.  Anyways, I steamed the carrots shortly before sauteeing them, and used a touch more brown sugar (because, as I mentioned, b/f doesn't like balsamic). I personally really enjoyed these and would make them again had my b/f liked them.

I liked this.  It's hard to come up with something interesting and EASY to do with carrots and this is it.  It won't be the star of your dinner but it's a great supporting player.  I like the slight sweetness with the tang of the vinegar.   Not everyone liked this as well as I did but nobody disliked it.    Do steam the carrots for 10 minutes before frying, they will be cooked but still a bit crunchy.

Fixed these to go with TG Dinner.  They weren't exactly a crowd pleaser.  It may have been they weren't exactly as pleasing to the eye as traditional carrots or it may have been the distinctly different taste.   Probably won't serve to family or friends again but I thought these were okay.

These carrots were pretty tasty, but the flavor wasn't strong enough for my liking. Next time, I may even try doubling the oil/vinegar amounts. I agree with other reviewers that it works best to steam the carrots first

These were real good! I don't eat cooked carrots much, I prefer them raw but was looking for something a little diffrent. Yummy! A nice change I really liked them! I was a little worried that the balsamic vinegar would be a little overpowering but it was just great! The only change I made was that I roasted mine in the oven rather than stir frying them on the stove top. 10 min. didn't seem like anywhere near enough time to get them cooked. I like mine a little crunchy, not completley soft & I still think 10 min. would have not been enough. So I took another reviewers advice and preheated the oven to 425 degrees & tossed the carrots with the olive oil. Baked for 20 min. Then mixed in the balsamic & brown sugar & baked again for another 2-3 min. Turned out perfect! They were cooked & still a little crunchy just the way I like them! They maybe could have been cooked a little longer but they were still good! You could still taste the carrot taste & the glaze gave it a lightly sweet flavor! My only complaint was that the glaze was a little runny...maybe next time I'll add a little cornstarch in to thicken it up a bit. But great recipe, my hubby & I finished them all up, there were no leftovers :)

Very good! Easy and quick, though it did take closer to 15-20 minutes to saute the carrots.

These were wonderful!  I steamed them in the microwave for a few minutes and then put them in the oven like other reviews suggested.  Will definitely make again.

WoW ! My family really enjoyed this!!  I used regular carrots because I find the baby carrots when cooked have a funky taste. After adding the brown sugar and balsamic vinegar I cooked it awhile longer so the strong taste and smell of vinegar evaporated. Thanks!  :=)

Quick and easy.  Very Delicious!  I used regular carrots and cut them up into round slices.  I then sauteed them with some onions I was caramelizing.

I gave it four stars because the balsamic made the carrots a little too tart for my taste buds.  Added 1 tsp of honey & it was delish!

This recipe is special.  Carrots tend to be bland - the balsamic gives it a lift.
I've made this recipe on a number of occasions and each time hardly any leftovers, hence the 5 stars.

After reading the reviews I made the following adjustment: Pre boiled the carrots and then followed the recipe exactly.  These were great tasting! My husband was in full agreement that this is a five star recipe.  This is a great way to change up the boredom of plain old carrots.  Thanks, Harry for a great recipe.

These carrots are delicious! The combination of balsamic vinegar, olive oil and brown sugar proves to be an excellent one. Very tasty!  Cooking time to get the carrots tender (at least to  my taste) was substantially longer than 10 minutes, though, even with the carrots cut in half.

I like these; I received compliments on them. Some recipes will 'hide' the flavor of the carrot. This is not one of those. In my opinion, the carrots need to cook longer to be more tender. If I'm going to eat a warm carrot I want it cooked; I think it was too crunchy just cooking it 10 minutes. I liked the combination of the vinegar and sugar, as did my guests. I would serve this again, but would be sure the  guests liked carrots. Definitely not something one could sneak in on their kids!

good stuff... i like a little more brown sugar and a little less vinegar... my g/f thought the stock was a little to sweet and should use a little less of both.

I gave this 3 stars because the kids loved it.  However, the cooking time was defininely way off.  I sauted for 30 minutes and then finally finished the carrots off in the microwave in order to get them soft enough to serve.  The next time I will either start in the microwave or steam them for quicker results.

I want to be fair when rating this recipe. I thought that the balsamic vinegar over powered the taste. I followed the recipe exactly, the carrots came out tender (took a little longer to cook)made sure that I measured everything correctly. Next time I think that I'll cut back on the vinegar or add a little butter. I'll have to play with it.

These were delicious.  I don't know if it took longer to "soften up" the carrots because I doubled the recipe (it took about 30 minutes), but it really doesn't  matter, because they were a huge success at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I'll definitely make them again.

The taste wasy quite good.  I cooked them about 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for but they were still pretty crunchy.  I would definately cook them for longer before adding the other ingredients so that they aren't so crunchy.  Otherwise, quite tasty.

I hate to give bad reviews but I wouldn't want to lead anyone to believe these are great.  I read reviews and decided to cover while I sauteed.  I measured everything, set timer, and half way through could see they were going to be dry so I added just a splash of lemon flavored bottled water (also hoping it would add something)...it really didn't 'bring it up a notch' but after 10 min. they were done to my liking...not mushy not crunchy.  I added the balsamic and could see it running around in what seemed to be the little bit of the 1tbsp. oil that was left.  I tried doing a 'balsamic reduction' hoping that it would stick to the carrots (as also mentioned in the reviews).  What I ended up with were carrots and a few drops of balsamic oily mixture in the bottom of the pan.  I had to add some salt and added a hint of cinnamon.  I guess it is a good thing I like carrots since I will be the only one eating them.  Hubby won't touch them.  Back to search for another side dish.  All is not lost; barely any fat, healthy, and loaded with B-carotene; thus the 2 stars.

Very nice! i followed others advice on boiling the carrots for awhile. It helps to soften the carrots and allowed the flavor to infuse much easier. 2 thumbs up!

Good, but I think I will use more glaze next time to really get a strong flavor. Easy though.

I took some others advice and boiled the carrots first, then added onion slivers. Makes for a great side dish. We loved it.

A good recipe over all. I don't like my carrots to cooked so I did not steam them before I sauted them. I am going to try a flavored balsamic vinegar next time and see if that adds more zing.

Incredibly delicious for how really easy it is to make. The guests raved over this.
I cut the carrots lengthwise to decrease the cooking time just a bit.

You really must boil the baby carrots until soft. Not soft like mashed, but a step above al dente. I enjoyed this side dish. It has a nice sweet tang to it. A very nice alternative to the usual butter and brown sugar carrots and easy to prepare. Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as directed.  Sauteeing the carrots wasn't enough; they were still crunchy, long after the recommended cooking time.  I also found that the glaze didn't glaze the carrots, but kept on pooling at the bottom of the serving dish - therefore, the carrots did not have much flavour.  What flavour they did have, however, was a nice delicate one - I imagine if the carrots were tender, and the glaze stayed on the carrots, this would be a good recipe.

Thie turned out pretty good, my husband and I really liked it.  My children however had a different opinion.  I added afew pieces of chopped celery for a bit of color and texture to it and I think it went really nicely.  Good to try at least once!

These were a nice change of pace.  I didn't saute the carrots, boiled instead, then tossed with the sugar and vinegar (and a couple pats of butter). They smelled delicious!

Sorry to say, I did not add the brown sugar (I try to consume as little sugar as possible); it was delicious regardless!  I never thought of sauteing baby carrots; I can eat them raw.  But it brought about a completely different flavor and texture.  Now I have an idea for an extremely simple and quick side dish.

Served this to some close friends the first time. I increased the balsamic (use the good stuff) to 2T but everyone raved over them.  I will be making these again.  It may take longer than 10 min to cook the carrots depending on their size. 
Overall a great recipe and new twist for a veggie.  Yummy!!

Since I'm not a fan of the strong flavor of olive oil, I used a mix of coconut oil and butter. I also used a Fig & Walnut Savory Balsamic.

Excellent dish. I made a few modifications.  Definitely steam carrots until half cooked. I also roasted in 400 oven for 30 minutes in a well buttered dish with carrots mixed with butter only. I then removed, added my other ingredients and baked for another 15 minutes. I used butter instead of olive oil since I ran out. I also added a bit of garlic,  a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Absolutely delicious!

I softened the carrots on a griddle with extra virgin olive oil and then when done tossed in a bowl with balsamic and a little bitty pat of butter.  I substituted the brown sugar for organic coconut sugar.  Will make again!

Didn't need to change a thing. Great side dish with grilled steaks and mashed potatoes.  Even my husband, who doesn't care normally for cooked carrots gave this recipe a rave review.

It was deliciously simple. I just cut up some big carrots instead of using baby ones. 

By the way, I had a fair bit of glaze left over from the carrots, and it was YUMMY poured over my main dish of steak.

I made like the recipe, but it was more like 20 min sautéed.  Next time I'll take previous advice and toss with olive oil and roast!

Such a simple and splendid side dish to make.  The kids gobbled up the carrots thinking they were sweet potato fries.  Adults were fooled too.  I made a few minor changes. First, I used prepacked carrot sticks instead of baby carrots. All other ingredients were the same. As another reviewer suggested, I  tossed the carrots with 2T olive oil the roasted in the oven for 20 minutes at 425 degrees.  I then took the pan out of the oven and sprinkled 2 T Balsamic Vinegar and 2 T brown sugar over the carrots. I put the tray back in the over and roasted for 3-5 minutes or until the balsamic evaporates. Yum yum yum.

I made them and enjoyed the recipe!  They did need to cook a bit longer than suggested, but that will vary every time depending on the thickness of the carrots.  I served them with a turkey ham and the slight sweetness of the recipe complimented the main course nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple and easy recipe. Cooking the carrots takes longer than ten minutes depending on how soft you like them. A good one for taking as a side dish to share. Looks and tastes like it takes longer to prepare than it does.

Amazing take on carrots! First time I used diced canned carrots and the next fresh baby that I boiled and cut in half before sautéing. My BF and I agreed that the canned were better, they seemed to really soak up the flavor better.

I didn't have baby carrots so I just cut carrots up into chunks. I sautéed them with the lid on and they were done in 10 minutes. I added a little butter as well as some pink salt and fresh ground pepper.  Love the balsamic/brown sugar combo!I would make a much larger batch next time. So good!!!

The recipe can easily go either way on the good/avg side. I buy my carrots from the local farmer's market as long as I can. They are always sweeter than supermarket. I ended up deciding to try this for the 1st time with smashed potatoes and prime rib. I try not to buy "baby" carrots in plastic bags as they are just regular carrots that are trimmed down because they are not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. What I did was just use regular carrots and I added a tbsp of honey. I think the honey  just balances the flavor a bit. Balsamic can be an "acquired" taste to some people.

I never cared for carrots cooked, but I now have my new favorite side dish.  I followed the recipe, and I added garlic & herb seasoning, as well as thyme with the oil.  I roasted the carrots at 425F, sprinkled the balsamic vinegar over the carrots, and roasted another 10 minutes.  I omitted the brown sugar.  Easy prep and clean up...delish!

This recipe get 5 stars for taste and simplicity, but I give 4 stars to my review because, as others have stated, the cooking instructions aren't sufficient. I steamed the carrots for 5 minutes, sauteed 5 minutes, added the sugar and vinegar, then sauteed another 5 minutes. This got the carrots tender but still firm (just the way I like them!) and the glaze clung nicely. My husband would have liked them a little softer, though. He couldn't believe it when I told him I cooked them 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for!

These carrots were quick and yummy!  When I was sautéing the carrots I added 1/4 cup of water and covered with the lid, stirring occasionally for 10 min.  Then I uncovered and turned the heat on high to dissolve most of the water.  I added the balsamic vinegar and probably about 3 Tbs of brown sugar (I was too lazy to get the measuring spoon).  It was so good.  Wasn't too sweet, but then our family likes sweet things.  My 19 mo. daughter and 3 year old niece ate 2 helpings (and my niece only likes to eat bread).  Thanks for the recipe will use again.

These are yummy.  I let the carrots cook in the vinegar/brown sugar for a while.

Fast & easy! Great recipe! It took a bit longer than 10 min if you want your carrots a little softer.  I think next time I will cook in the microwave and then saute.

i love balsamic vinegar, but the sautee method does take quite a while.  next time i will steam them first and coat them in a skillet with the vinegar, sugar and oil.  great recipe for another tasty vegetable side dish!

Although my children are not the BIGGEST CARROT EATERS I needed a plan to accomedate them. SO when I found this recipe I seen that it may be worth a try. I used frozen carrots and i stauted and covered them to give them that same steam quality I also didnt have the balsamic vinger but I had balsamic dressing and butter and it turn out just as well.... the result from my children NO LEFT OVERS AND THEY ASKED FOR MORE! A DISH TO KEEP THAT IS EASY AND SATISFYING

This recipe was really good! I followed other reviewers' reccomendations to steam the carrots first before sauteeing them to cut down on the cooking time. I sauteed them with olive oil and a little butter ('cause that always makes things better) and instead of brown sugar, I stirred in some honey and maple syrup. Absolutely delish! I have already made it for Thanksigiving and Christmas and will definitely keep making it!

This recipe was good, but nothing to write home about. The sauteeing method took twice as long as listed and I doubt I will make again because I have found faster and tastier baby carrot recipes on this site.

This is fantastic.  Just made a little change. Doubled the sauce..only used 2 Tbsp balsamic..and 2 1/2 Tbsp sugar.  My 9 year old taste tester said she liked them a little sweeter.  Oh..and I steamed the baby carrots beforehand.  YUMMY!!

Took advice to steam prior to saute step. Used regular carrots cut up in sticks in place of baby carrots. It was a nice alternative to regular steamed carrots.

These carrots tasted very good, but as others noted, the time to cook them isn't even close to accurate. I boiled them for 10 minutes, then drained and sauteed them for another 5 minutes until they were tender.

This is a wonderful recipe! My picky one year old is big into carrots right now, so I was looking for a creative way to cook them. I used large carrots cut into 1/4 inch rounds instead because I was thinking baby carrots would take so much longer to cook. They turned out great! I even did this to cooked green beans and they were great too! My son, husband, and myself loved these and I now make them at least once a week.

A delicious way to include more carrots in our meals! I microwave mine until almost tender (to keep more vitamins) and then I added them to the rest of the ingredients and simmered all for 3-5 minutes. I've also made them with maple syrup in place of the brown sugar, and will be trying some of the variations others suggested. I can now grab a bag of carrots when shopping and know they won't go to waste due to lack of a good recipe.

These were pretty decent. I am not a huge fan of cooked carrots so I am still looking for the perfect recipe I can make that will help me enjoy them more, but every one in my family gobbled these up. I might use a little less brown sugar next time. I just used some whole carrots that I had leftover, sliced, instead of baby carrots. I also steamed my carrots before sauteeing them.

Pretty good- I halved the recipe and subbed the oil for butter.  After sauteing for a few I realized I should have pre cooked the carrots so I added a cup of water and let them boil down.  Afterwords I doubled the brown sugar and vinegar and added a dash of cinnamon.

The carrots were "alright" I liked them, but they were definitely not spectacular.  If I make them again, I will use butter instead of olive oil, and slighly less balsamic vinegar, and a little more sugar...it was a nice change of pace, but not something that I would make very often.  I normally love balsamic vinegar, but this just didn't do it for me.

Not a huge fan, and I LOVE glazed carrots and basalmic.  I guess I just don't like them together.

This recipe gave very delicious, tender (but not mushy) carrots. the flavor was good and not over powering, and the cooking process was very simple. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this with snap peas instead, and cut the sugar to 1tsp. since my mom doesn't like sweet vegetables, and they turned out really well. Good combo of flavors and easy to whip up.

delicious, just gave it 4 stars because the cooking time was off. i'd say on the stovetop it could take between 15 and 25 minutes. might try steaming in the microwave first next time.

These were kind of weird tasting, I don't know what it was because I usually like balsamic on most things! I boiled for 2 mins and then sauteed them to speed up the process. Edible though I don't think I would make them again.

I followed the advice of one reviewer and used honey.  I did not like that at all.  If could be, however, the type of honey we get here in Kenya.  I'll try again with brown sugar.

If you are looking for a sweet glazed carrot this is NOT your recipe!  I made this mistake and got a mouthful of raw carrot + balsamic vinegar = not my taste.

After steaming the carrots in the microwave for 5 min., I sauteed them for another 5-7 min. and they still came out somewhat crunchy.  By the time I got to work (for our Thanksgiving luncheon), they had shriveled up.  My coworkers said the flavor was pretty good but the carrots were too crunchy.  I thought the flavor was just okay (and I love balsamic vinegar), but overall I was disappointed in this dish.

These were very good!  Simple too.  Next time I will steam the carrots though as it took much longer than 10 minutes to cook and some of the carrots started to burn.  Thanks!

Could have cooked longer - a bit raw still. Tastey but seemed unfinished somehow.  Love carrots - I'll probably try one more time  but cook longer.

My husband loves this recipe...the boys..not so much.  I use regular carrots (cannot get baby carrots here in Asia) and steam them.  The fragrance of the balsamic vinegar fills the kitchen---my husband salivates!  (The boys say--what's that smell! So there ya go...)  I will make this again and again...

These carrots were just okay.  You do have to cook them longer then the recipe states, and the flavour just wasn't that great to me.

These carrots just ok. I don't see where it only takes 10 mins After 10 minutes they were as  hard when I started.  Took about 20 minutes or more. Next time I'm going to steam them first and double recipe of vinegar & brown sugar.  Only 1 star from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I modified for my own personal taste:  Cooked in micro for about six minutes to soften carrots, used less oil, and used a little more brown sugar.  I will cook again.  Maybe next time try them with butter.  A keeper.

My son and I don't like balsamic, but my husband loves it.  I made this recipe to be nice, but instead of letting the carrots sit in the leftover balsamic forever, I let them sit for a few minutes and drained the rest out. The carrots were wonderful!  They weren't overly dry (which I think they would have been otherwise.)

When I cooked these, I didn't use quite three cups (about 2.5), but I did use the remaining amount of other ingredients.  While they didn't taste bad, they were nothing fantastic, I much prefer plain carrots with just butter (or with honey).  I do want to point out that the cook time is waaay off for this dish....I cooked for 10 minutes and the carrots were no where even close to being done.  I ended up covering and cooking for about another 10 minutes.

Very good...I usually make my carrots sweet so this was a welcome change.  I'll reduce the amount of vinegar next time as it was a little too runny for my taste.  But excellent flavor!

Very good. I found it took quite a bit longer than 10 minutes to get the carrots tender, but still an easy and tasy recipe. My boyfriend (who is a veggie hater anyway) only thought it was so-so, but I enjoyed it very much. Will probably use again.

Good flavor.  All 3 kids enjoyed them as well (ages 5 & under).  Reminded me of a sweet & sour carrot.  Nice twist on candied carrots.

These did not impress me after cooked, but i had leftovers the next day and they were quite good...must have absorbed more flavor overnight. I also added italian seasoning to give more flavor.

Very good, very easy.  I boiled the carrots first because I like them more tender.  My coating stuck just fine.  These are also good at room temperature.  Could use a little spicing up but are good as is.

This is a great recipe.  I usually roast carrots in the oven, but this was much easier and quicker.  I did steam the carrots for about 10 minutes before putting them in the sautee pan, and they turned out PERFECT!

We loved these carrots.  Made them with parsnips and carrots and the parsnips really added a new flavor. If your in a hurry you can steam the carrots and parsnips than follow the recipe.

Not bad and very easy.  I just put a cover on the dish while I sauteed the carrots and they were done in about 15 minutes.  Sorry only 3 stars - nothing wrong with the recipe, it's just hard to rave over carrots!

Per reviews, I steamed the carrots, first.  I meant to just steam them 'al dente' (is that possible with carrots?) but cooked them completely.

So, I just gave them a minute in the olive oil, before adding the other ingredients.  Still, I liked them.  They were different, in a good way.  I'll be making them again.

I used large carrots, cut in half lengthwise then again to make smaller.  I will make again.

Easy and tasty.  I added a small chopped onion which I'm glad I did.  People really seemed to notice the flavor of the vinegar in the onions and commented positively.  I think it definitely added to the dish.

This was great for dinner with friends. Quick and simple. It went very well with the Rosemary Red Potatoes. The sweet and the musky flavors complimented one another nicely.

These were alright.  However, if I make them again, I'll probably just steam the carrots and put the glaze on them after.

Nice.  I followed someone's suggestion & boiled them first for about 4-5 minutes, followed by a brief sautee & then about a couple tbsp each of sugar & balsamic until it tasted right.  Will definitely do again.  EASY.

This was quick and easy-a must for a new mom!  The brown sugar complimented the vinegar perfectly.  I cooked the carrots longer than the recipe called for, but it turned out great.
