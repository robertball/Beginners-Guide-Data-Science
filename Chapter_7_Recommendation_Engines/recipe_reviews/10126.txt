These cookies were so easy to make and they looked as though I brought them at the store. My friends loved them as gifts.

The recipe is not clear that you need to make an indent with your thumb or finger on each ball of dough, THEN place the cherry on TOP of the cookie and bake. It sounded to me like I needed to put the cherries inside the dough--hubby looked at them and said "That's not the way my mom always made them!" Ooops! I had to find a picture online to see what he was talking about. :p

This recipe BARELY makes 24, if you make small-ish balls of dough. So don't cut 24 cherries in half, only cut 12. In my oven, they came out still white, but nice and cooked at 11 minutes, so watch to make sure you don't overbake.

This were lovely!  I skipped the nuts because my husband isn't a huge fan and I put nuts in the other "Make Ahead" recipes, so I figured I'd give him a break on this one. These would be really nice on a holiday cookie tray, very pretty.  So easy when you have a batch of the "Make Ahead Mix" already prepared!
