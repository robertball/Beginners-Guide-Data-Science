I can't say enough about this cake, it was excellent!  I didn't add the liquor, as I didn't have any on hand and I added whip cream into the layer and iced it with whip cream.  It was so moist, everybody had seconds.  I found my husband the next day with a fork and the leftovers.

Omagosh this is goooood!!! I made it once as the recipe stated with cherry pie filling & cool whip topping, and again with raspberry pie filling, topped with a chocolate glaze and mounds of fresh raspberries. MMMMmMmmm...it was so good. The cake itself is so moist and delicous, you must try this recipe.

I made this as a birthday cake and it  turned out wonderful.  Just rich enough without being too rich, very moist without falling apart.    Used cool whip as a topping, as the cake is fabulous enough without a frosting.  Only changes I made was adding a little cardamom to the batter and I omitted the liqueur this time (but will definitely try it next time.)  Will definitely make this cake again.

I barely made any changes to the actual cake portion of this recipe but did use 1/4 cup applesauce in addition to ¼ cup oil instead of a full ½ cup of oil.  I also used half of Hershey’s Dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa.  Using the cake as a base, I added the following, loosely following another recipe:

Once cake cooled, I poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake.  Then I used a mix of .5 cup creamed butter, .3 cup of /granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes.  I put one can of cherry pie filling (excluding juice) on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream.  I put the other cake on top then laid another can of cherry pie filling, sans juice, on top followed with more whipped cream.  I used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when I made the cream for the middle and top of cake, which was perfect.

I had one slice right away and, while it was good, thought it was missing something, but didn’t know what.  The cherries were somehow boring as well.  The next day, somehow, it was wonderful!  It was very moist and the flavors were enhanced.  I originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time; however, each day that passes (day 3 now), the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake!  

I will definitely use this recipe for any chocolate cakes I make from now on!

This is excellent - beautiful results with relatively little work. I whipped up a big container of Rich's Whip and put it in between the two layers with the cherry filling, and on top with a few cherries for garnishes. My company was impressed with the looks and loved the taste.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and baked it in 2 8-inch round cake pans. The batter was very liquid. After 30 minutes of baking, the batter had oozed out all over the oven, and what was left in the pans was still jiggly inside with a baked crust on top. What did I do wrong? Everyone else seems to love it, and it looked so good. :(

Great recipe. I did not use the  liqueur though. Instead, I bought the canned cherry filling washed off the liquid in it and mixed the chopped cherries with some of the whipped cream and layered the cake with it after drizzling with the cherry syrup. then topped with whipped cream. It was a super hit.

The chocolate cake itself is absolutely wonderful--moist, flavorful, and easy to bake.  I used low fat whipped topping to make a ring around the bottom layer, placed half the low sugar cherry filling in the center, and chilled the layer.  I then put the second layer on top and repeated the topping and cherry filling.  We decided it was too pretty to cover the sides of the cake.  It keeps beautifully in the refrigerator and gets better with time.  My whole family LOVES this cake. THANKS LOADS FOR SHARING YOUR RECIPE.

This cake was a delicious addition to a dinner I had with friends. I used soymilk to make it vegan. I also used splenda and no sugar added cherries to make it healthier. It was amazing and delicious! Def recommend.

Just made this cake and although I'm pretty confident it's going to taste great, it didn't rise nearly as much as I thought it would - there's no way I could cut the cakes in half!  I followed the recipe as closely as possible, so if anyone could offer some tips on where I may have gone wrong, I'd really appreciate it.  Black Forest Cake is my Dad's favourite and I'd love to make a perfect one for his birthday!  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent, and relatively easy to make! I used 3 different sixed layers, which worked great, and iced it with 1 and a half cups of cream, 3 teaspoons of cherry liquor and 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence whipped in to stiff peaks. It went down a treat!! Cherries, fresh or tinned, make great decorations as well

This is just plain great chocolate cake.  I've made many made-from-scratch chocolate cakes in my day that are worse than boxed cake.  Not so, with this one.  It's light, moist, and nicely chocolatey.  I, too, used the recipe for the cherries from Black Forest Cake I from this site.  And real whipped cream is a must.  The combination is stunning.

Yum....this cake was delicious.  I made it in a 9x13 pan, which worked out great.  I used kirsch as the liqueur in the cherry filling.  I also filled the centre and covered the top with a whipped cream icing made with 3 cups of cool whip, 2/3 cup icing sugar and 2/3 cup sour cream.  It is a nice stiff whipped cream that is very easy to work with and not too sweet.  I will definitely be making this cake again.  It got rave reviews!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and we all agree the recipe is our new go-to chocolate cake recipe!  For this particular recipe, I cut each layer in two, making 4 layers. I used 3 of those layers for the cake, putting a layer of whipping cream/powdered sugar mixture and a layer of cherries between each layer. I skipped the cherry liqueur altogether, and it wasn't missed. Great Black Forest Cake recipe and great go-to chocolate cake recipe!

My lovely daughter the Sporadic Cook made this lovely cake for her dad's birthday. Although she preferred not to use cherry liqueur, the cake still boasts of cherry flavor. The chocolate and cherries are a wonderful combination.  It is exquisite. She frosted the cake with whipped cream and garnished it with shaved chocolate and maraschino cherries.  I also give my daughter five stars for making such a beautiful cake. If you need a high altitude version please see the custom version.

I made this cake for my 1 yr anniversary in September and it was the best tasting cake I've ever had! Making it again for New Years Eve. Last time I used cherry pie filling and this time I'm using raspberry. Going to ice the cake with cream cheese icing like last time. It's delicious with the cream cheese!

Cake was amazingly moist and delicious.  May not be fair for me to rate this recipe because we did substitute 1 cup water with vanilla and cocoa in it for coffee since we don't drink coffee. And we didn't use any liquor either.  Was absolutely gobbled up!! I also used the topping idea from Black Forest Cake I recipe.  Yu-uhm!

I made this for Easter. EVERYONE LOVED THIS CAKE!!!!! It was so moist, so delicious, OMG!!! For cupcakes bake 20 minutes! I didn't have soured cheeries for another recipe, so I used this one instead. But I decorated it like the other one, layers and all. This was so good! I put the filling (from the other recipe) inside what I thought was thick, but once the cake was cut the next day, I think it actually absorbed into the cake, so next time, I will put more filling. Just a little more. But it was delicious!!!!! It was gone! I made a carrot cake too and there was a delicious Birthday cake there. This cake was the first to go! So good.
I didn't have cherry liquer, I just realized it asked for it! Oh well, it was still delicious without it and I didn't replace it with anything (another liquid). For the whipping cream (which you didn't really see or taste) I added a capful of vanilla extract and a little more powdered sugar to suite my taste. It tasted good on its own. I wonder if the cake was so moist because it absorbed all of the filling! Update: Made these as cupcakes! Bake for 20 minutes! still delicious....

Great Recipe. I did not change a thing. It came out super moist and was a big hit with friends. I topped mine with homemade whipped cream, shaved chocolate and maraschino cherries . If I make it again I will probably be a bit more adventurous and make my own cherry filling. However, it was still very yummy with the canned filling.

Moist, delicious and absolutely the BEST cake I have ever made! I made it for Valentine's Day this year and felt the love come back to me in abundance for this one! lol. Piped the edges with the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting (also from this site). Spectacular! Yes, it is NOT health food, but c'mon, it's also NOT everyday food. ;) Thank You Jenny! :) Yummm.

This cake tasted fabulous! One of the best tasting black forest cake recipes! Note: the coffee needs to be a dark roast and strong to taste it in the cake; used dark chocolate AND regular unsweetened cocoa powder (1/2 cup of the dark and 1/4 cup of the regular cocoa powder). Also, I live at a high altitude and had trouble with the center of the cakes falling and baking time was about 10 minutes longer. Need suggestions about baking cakes from scratch at high altitudes.

I'm not sure I would make this cake again, unless I use unsweetened chocolate, versus cocoa, more/stronger coffee (perhaps espresso), or etc., to give this cake a darker flavor.  I suppose I had expected a darker chocolate flavor, given the title "Black" and I have come to appreciate 86% (or higher) cacao, so that's what I was hoping for, but didn't get to my satisfaction. Then again, I think any chocolate lover would like this cake, to a degree.  The ingredients are the same as the recipe for Black Magic cake, except that this calls for less salt and making sour milk versus using buttermilk, that may make a difference.  This is also the same recipe as The Barefoot Contessa's "Beatty's Cake", except that hers calls for a buttercream frosting versus cherry filling/liquer.  I used the cherry topping but bought a 'No Sugar Added, with Splenda' version and the Splenda gave the topping such a sickeningly sweet taste I couldn't stand to use all of it.  So don't even try it! I opted to go with 'The Contessa's' directions to use hot vs cold coffee and feel that that was a mistake; on one hand, the hot temperature might have helped make a better syrup out of the cocoa, but it is probably what gave the cake more of a 'scrambled egg' texture, with the coffee not being tempered (I did add the coffee in gradually, but also took "hot" to mean "hot"); I do think using COLD coffee, as this recipe indicates, is a better idea.  Overall, I'm glad I gave this a try, but may not do it again.

This black forest cake was fantastic! we did everything in the recipe using organic cocoa powder, premium coffee. The only substitution we made was using chambord liqueur (black rasberry liqueur) in place of the cherry liqueur. I do have to say that it made a difference in the cake that was definitely to our liking :)

Good recipe, however, the batter is very thin. When I tried it with a spring form cake pan, it leaked and made a huge mess. I guess you should just stick with the regular cake pans when making this cake.

FANTASTIC!!!! Hubby requested a black forest cake for his Birthday and this is the recipe I decided on...everyone raved!!! Made as written, but did not use the liquor in the cherry filling due to the fact that kids were eating this as well, but I plan to try it that way another time. The cake is dense, but very moist. I topped mine with homemade chocolate/marshmallow buttercream. This cake will definately be made again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this cake twice, the first time without the cherry liqueur and the second time with.  I certainly recommend taking the time to locate the liqueur and using it (although it is a bit expensive)!! I did not use canned pie filling (I don't like the corn syrup base and it does not contain enough cherries) I used frozen cherries, sugar, cornstarch, butter & almond extract to make my own, it is far less sweet.  I also whipped up some fresh whipping cream and placed it in between the layers and on top.  The chocolate cake was excellent.  Great recipe--thanks for sharing!!

Wow, I've made this cake thre times and it has never failed to please. Fantastic, it almost has the taste of a red velvet. I highly recommend it with cream cheese frosting. I replaced the cherry liquor with raspberry schnapps and it was AMAZING.

I did my own recipe for the cherry filling so I'm just reviewing the cake.  Oh. My. Goodness.  This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  It's so light and fluffy.  I took it to my friend's birthday party and he could not stop talking about it and made everyone try it.  I got a lot of compliments.  Follow the cake recipe exactly.  You won't be disappointed.  I did do one thing differently though.  I didn't have round pans so I used one 9x13 sheet cake pan.  Baked about the same so you shouldn't need to adjust cooking times.

I made this cake for my fathers Birthday.  It was a huge hit and requested again for Easter.  I recommend cooking it alittle longer.  My cake was great, but too moist to cut into 4 layers.  So I just stacked my two 9" cakes on top of each other with cherries in the middle.  I frosted the sides of my cake with chocolate frosting to keep cherry filling in.  I then used homemade whipped topping on the edges and cherries on the top in the middle.  It looked as good as it tasted.   Its even better the next day after sitting in frig over night.  YUMMY!!

Husband liked it! (I accidentally added the Kirsch to the batter, so I added an extra egg and half a cup of flour.) He prefers the cake with the cherries baked inside.

I absolutely LOVE this cake. Made it on valentines day for the first time, its my boyfriends favorite so i was a little nervous because i thought it was going to be more complicated, but It felt so easy and effortless to make, and he loved it!! The filling with the kirsch is super good, but for me the chocolate cake is the best part, is so moist and fluffy, ill definitely use that chocolate base to create different types of cake in the future!

This recipe is wonderful, easy, quick, moist and not crazy sweet, but nicely! I mixed up cherry pie filling with the liquid of Maraschino's cherry and a spoon of vodka, because didn't find cherry liqueur, it came out great! Thank you!

I had the same problem as Jay-Nut with the 2 8"rounds overflowing in the oven but don't live at high altitudes.  I had a funny feeling when the pans were 3/4 full that it wasn't right, but doublechecked the recipe and my pan size.  Mine are the traditional 8" pan, not the deeper ones.  Will try 9" pans next time.  Everyone raves, so worth trying again.

This cake was fantastic!  I didn't add cherries or whipped cream, because I wanted to test the basic recipe for a German-themed party I'll be having.  Also, my son has an egg allergy, so I substituted the eggs for 1/4 cup of applesauce (takes a few minutes longer to bake when I do that).  The cake was so moist and flavorful and delicious!!  I can't wait to make it again WITH the cherries and frosting and serve it at our party later this month!!

This is definately a keeper!!!  I made my own birthday cake with this recipe.  I used the Cherry Pie filling recipe on this site (cut in half) and Sweetened Whipped Cream Recipe.  Used 2 cup heavy cream, 5 Tbs Confectioners Sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  The cake was moist, fluffy and really good!  It tasted like a bakery cake.  I will use this recipe again for the chocloate cake.  I did not use liqueur b/c I don't like liqueur on my cakes.  Update*** I used 1 1/2 cups cherries, 1/4 cup sugar & 1 Tbs cornstarch for the filling.  Follow diections for cherry pie filling.  It was the perfect amount.

The cake turned out nice and moist and tasty.  Next time I make it I will add a chocolate mousse layer to the middle.  Everyone loved it and thought it was delicous!

BEST chocolate cake EVER!  I used applesauce instead of oil and sour cream instead of vinegar and milk, it came out fabulous!  I topped with a cool whip frosting which I mixed a box of cheesecake pudding....YUMMY!

This was amazing!  I had to change it a little bit though, I took out the coffee and just added water (we don't drink/eat coffee in any form) and even w/o the coffee it tasted amazing.  It was so moist too.  Definitely a favorite we will use over and over.  

Instead of using canned pie filling I whipped up some cream and added cherry extract to it and added maraschino cherries.  Then used whipped cream as the outside frosting.  Chocolate ganache drizzled on the side and topped with more cherries.  It was delicious!

This cake came out wonderfully! So moist and great taste. For the filling I made the chocolate cream cheese coconut frosting, and on the outside, I mixed whipped topping with 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, and 1/4 cup unsweetened chocolate power, I think next time I will make this into cupcakes!

The chocolate cake recipe is amazing - it has a great chocolately taste, is extremely moist, and has a pretty dense texture. Would probably also be great as cupcakes. I've been looking for a chocolate cake that wasn't dry - and my search is over.

Great recipe! I soaked the cherries in orange liqueur and used the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" inside and to frost the cake. Finger licking good! Oh the chocolate cake recipe is exactly the same as the "Black Magic Cake" which is my favorite!!!!

I LOVED this cake. The batter was really thin when I poured it into the pans, but it turned out great! I didn't use the liquer, just a tart cherry pie filling and cool whip on top. My first attempt at this cake looked a bit of a mess, the cherry layer can kind of slide the cake layer if you don't know what you are doing. :) I will try to make it prettier next time with real fresh whipped cream.

My pans overflowed during baking, scorching the oven. A waste of expensive ingredients! I followed the recipe exactly. I used two 8" pans as directed.

Made this cake almost sugar-free with sugar free cherry pie filling, & lower in fat with egg whites. It was fantastic. Much better than a sugar-free box cake.
I used 1/2 splenda, 1/2 sugar, 3 whites whipped and folded in, but also used the 1/2 cup veg oil. Next time I will try adding applesauce instead of the veg oil and see how that changes the finished product.

Made this into a Portal-style anniversary cake for my bf.  Everyone who tried it had nothing but good things to say - three months later, my mother still raves about how delicious it was!  The only thing I would change in the future is omit the cherry liqueur - it made the filling a bit too runny and didn't add anything I felt I would miss.  Still - a perfectly yummy cake!

The cake was much loved by all at Thanksgiving.  I did not add the liqueur, because I could not find it anywhere, but it was great without it.  I also used 2 cans of cherry pie filling because I wanted to drizzle some on top.  I used a homemade whipped cream for my icing.  Great cake!

I was only having a couple of friends over, so I baked it in a loaf pan (half of the recipe) and the other half as cupcakes. Also I only used 1/2 C of instant coffee (the only thing I had in hand) and didn't use the liqueur... just whipped cream and cherry pie filling. Wow! My friends were impressed. It was really good.

I made this for a friend's birthday party that was held at our local pool hall. I didn't have any myself (because I added the Kirsch) but the cake was visually stunning. Acquaintances who were also at the pool hall approached our table and asked me for a piece of cake! I iced the cake with real whipped cream, chocolate fudge pudding, and the cherry mixture. (I also put the pudding on each of the layers-I had 4) I got rave reviews and people couldn't believe it was my first time making black forest cake.

Good cake.  I only made 1/2 the recipe and cooked them in smaller loaf pans because there was only 4 people to feed -way more than enough.  Worked great as a log shaped cake- ended up being four layers.  I skipped the brandy, but forgot to add the extra liquid in lieu.  The cake should have been a little more moist.  I will make sure to add it next time.

This cake was amazing.  I was skeptical about the no frosting thing, but it totally didn't need it, and probably would have detracted.

Delicious and moist! I made the cake into little 2-layer cupcakes, painstaking but soooo worth it! They were too cute! (see photos for this recipe--they turned out a bit messy but next time they'll be picture-perfect)

I thought this cake was going to fail as it was really runny and took about 50 min. rather than 30 min. to cook. In the end, it seemed quite moist but once I put the cherry filling (with rasberry liquer!) and whipped cream into 3 layers (cut each cake half in two) and then on top of it. It was delicious!!!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. Once for my sister's birthday, and twice just using the chocolate cake.  It is a very rich cake, so big slice are not needed.  This has become my standard chocolate cake recipe!  I will be making this again for my son's 3rd birthday cake this weekend.

I made my own filling for this, but the cake itself was fantastic!!!! I made it in 2 9inch springform pans. It didn't rise as much as I wanted it to so I made another 1/2 batch and ended up with a stunning 3 layer cake. Many of my guests said it was the best cake they'd ever tasted. My boyfriend has already requested it for his birthday (in November!) with a chocolate frosting. Thank you so much!!

I followed exactly the recipe for the cake. The cake is extremely moist, which is why it doesn't go too well with black forest cake. Black forest is also supposed to have whipped cream as topping so I added it in between the two cake layers and on top, before adding the cherry filling. This cake would probably be better as a normal chocolate cake used with buttercream frosting or something. It is a good cake, just not the best. "Black forest I" recipe from this site was a bigger hit with everyone. I will keep looking for the ultimate. Thanks!

I made this for my sister's birthday.  Added more flour, accidentally used less sugar and it was enough for two 9-inch pans.  The cake still turned out incredibly moist, and everyone loved it!  Thank you for this recipe!

This cake is awesome. Dont let the thiness of the batter fool you. This cake is so moist and very very tasty. Just dont brew the coffee to strong or it will overpower the other ingredients. I made this and iced it with a peanut butter buttercream icing. Sooooo gooood!

This recipe was so easy to make and SOOO delicious!  I followed the recipe except that I had to bake it for an extra 10-15 minutes.  Then I cut the layers in half to make four more thin layers.  I made some extra cherry filling and put whipped cream on with the filling between layers.  Then ice the whole thing in whipped cream and spread the last of the topping on the top.  It was GREAT!!  Also I didn't have any cherry liqueur so I used raspberry instead and it was riquisimo!  Thank you for the lovely recipe and I intend to make it again and again for guests.  :-)

I don't have two round pans so I baked it in a cookie sheet (approx 1/2 slab) for 25mins and it came out perfect.  Cut it in half, spread the cherries on one portion and placed the other half on top.  Covered with whipped cream and chocolate shavings with some cherries on top.  Perfect!  I am a cake box baker but not anymore.  This recipe was so easy and moist that I won't have to use a boxed mix again.

I made this into cupcakes, and it was tender, moist, & delicious--not too sweet & very chocolatey. I will definitely try it as a layer cake, using the cherries.

So good. So much glory. I made it for a party. I had never had it a day in my life, but everything pointed to trying out this recipe. Personally I'm not a radical chocolate cake person, but the recipe is phenominal. I recommend to anyone thinking about trying it, "DO IT." Follow the recipe and you're golden. People will experience God through your baking and your life may just radically change.

Like most of the others I didn't use liquor, instead I added a layer of cool whip to the middle mixed with homemade whip cream and did the same for the top and sides.

This is a wonderful cake and is definitely a keeper!  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of the kirsch (cherry liquor), I brushed it on top of both cake layers. This worked very well as you could taste the kirsh but it wasn't overpowering.  My only other suggestion might be to use parchment paper as well as greasing and flouring the pan as it was a bit difficult to get out.

Made this 3 times this summer. Recipe doubles & even triples well. If you run out of cocoa you can (as I did) substitute 150g melted dark chocolate whisked in at the same time as the sour milk. The result is more compact but still delicious.

Absolutely delicious. Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Made a couple of minor changes: the 1T vinegar wasn't enough to sour my milk so I added another T; I also made it gluten free by using 3/4c. brown rice flour + 1/2c. white rice flour + 1/2c. glutinous rice flour + 1t. xanthan gum in place of the wheat flour, everything else remained the same. I also found that it took 40 min total to bake, but i only had a 9x13 pan so that may account for the additional time. Will definitely make again.

Easy, quick and excellent. The texture was just right. I too, left out the cherry liquor, and at about 100 ft sea level I baked it about 40 min. We put home made whip on top, we decortated it with chocolate swirls made from melted chocolate chips that we drizzled on freezer paper and let harden in the fridge.

The only thing I skipped from this recipe was the cherry liqueur, because I didn't have any. I followed a reviewer's advice and used some whipped cream between the layers, along with the filling. It turned out great, moist but not mushy, and with a decadent chocolate taste. Absolutely wonderful!

The texture was amazing, but the flavor was only okay by itself.  Next time I'll add more sugr and vanilla.  However, with a little bit of cream cheese frosting, yum.  I want to add that I totally skipped the black foresting part and used the cake as base for chocolate cupcakes with cream cheese frosting.

My husband isn't a big cake and comfort food eater, but he ate 2 slices of this in under five minutes.  Fantastic recipe and I will definitely use it again.  I skipped the liqueur because I didn't have any, but it was still very rich.  Also added about a handful of dark chocolate chips to each cake afer baking for about 8 minutes, and finished the whole thing in whipped cream.  DELICIOUS!  Very worth the work.

Oh, Yum!!! This is the first homemade cake recipe that turned out as well as D.H. cake mix. Just perfect. The only change was I drained the canned cherries, and omitted the liqueur (since I didn't have it), and whisked a little butter, vanilla & powdered sugar and poured it over the cherries in the middle. Topped the cake with Chocolate Frosting I from this site - perfect!

Decent, but nothing to write home about. Its a very good basic chocolate cake recipe (and works fine with soy milk) but other than being an extremely aesthetic dessert, I was not overly wowed by the flavors.

I LOVED THIS!!!!!!!!!! I made it for my fiance's 29th birthday and it was perfect! Only thing i changed was the cherry filling. I blended about 2 cups of glacee (real)cherries and added some water and sugar and made the filling this way as i couldnt find cherrie pie filling. I made it into 3 layers and covered with chocolate icing and then set some melted chocolate into the same size as the top of the cake and used this to decorate with cream and then wrote in the middle with white choc jel. Was divine. I think next time ill make them into cupcakes though. LOL very unhealthy and sickning

This is a very moist, delicious cake! I doubled the recipe to make a larger cake for a birthday. I did not double the liqueur, because once I added the first half, the flavor was quite strong. Will definitely save this recipe to make again!

Very good cake. Used cherry pie filling with whipped cream a couple of times, real good. Favorite is cake with a scoop of whipped cream on top. One problem, every time I bake it the middle of the cake is collapsed, every time. Baked at least 6 times so 12 pans and everytime collapsed.

This didn't turn out so well for me.  I baked the cake in 2 9-inch springforms for 50 minutes.  Both the cakes collapsed.  I bought cherry liqueur but I don't think it's necessary because you can't taste it all.  If I make black forest cake again, I will use the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake" from this site as it turns out moist and delicious every time with far less steps.

Love this recipe. I made it for my husband birthday at church. It was so moist and everyone loved it. I used buttercream for filling and icing and chocolate chips for decoration. I didn't use cherry liquor but used rhum instead by brushing it on the cake before I put on the filling.

Very good! My first time making black forest cake and it turned out amazing! I followed the recipe to T except I left out the cherry liquer because it was too pricey and I used french vanilla coffee instead of regular coffee. Overall, everyone loved my cake and said it wasn't too sweet either :) Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time baking and tasting Black forest cake.  It was good and very moist, but I feel it was missing something (not that I have anything to compare it to).  Maybe because I was out of regular cocoa powder and used dark chocolate cocoa powder?  I don't know...I think if I decided to make it again, I'd tweek the recipe a little.

Fabulous! I took this cake to work with me and everybody ate it right up. I even caught a few people scraping the plate to get the leftover crumbs. A few people told me it was the best cake they'd ever had, and they didn't even like cherries! I didn't add the liqueur, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and used Cool Whip for the frosting.

This was a very good black forest cake recipe. But it just seemed like it was missing something. Either cool whip or a topping of some sort. Other than that it was a great recipe.

This is very moist yummy cake! It’s similar to the chocolate cake I always make that everyone loves. I didn’t have any cherry liqueur and it still came out wonderful. I used Irish Creme for the coffee and will use it next time too. I just put the canned cherries in the middle and cool whip all around the outside. Lets just say there were no left overs...

Fantastic!! I made this cake for a small dinner party and everyone raved.  I didn't use any liqueur but it was still delicious.  I frosted the sides with the Cool Whipped Frosting and it was perfect! Thank you for a great recipe.

Moist cake that is simple to make. I also used the whipping cream frosting recipe from the Black Forest cake 1 recipe and it turned out to be very yummy! I also used cherry pie filling but picked out the cherries so there was a lot less sauce but still some - that also worked well!

I substituted milk & vinegar for plain greek yogurt. Instead of cherries from a can, I made my own raspberry filling. It was a most delicious chocolate cake!

made this cake to recipe and it was very good. nice and light but still plebty chocolatey. I did NOT use cherry pie filling. I used 2 cans of red, tart cherries, in their juice with a lil sugar and thickened with corn starch. Also made a standard whipped cream to ice and brushed the layers with a kirschwasser simple syrup. Made a nice light, airy dessert with loads of flavor.

I LOVE this cake! The first time I made it I used a homemade cherry filling and topped with homemade whipped cream. The second, I didn't make it a black forest cake but instead made a chocolate frosting for it, from another recipe on this site. Both were very delicious. I took the second to a gathering and got a ton of compliments. I'm not usually much of a cake eater because they're often too dry for my taste but this one is SO moist. Just delicious.

This cake is delicious! I made it as directed. The only thing extra that I did was I added Cherry Liqueur Whipped Cream in the middle layer. I added 1/4 cup of Cherry Liqueur, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup white sugar to whipping cream. I also added the finished cream as a garnish on the side. Amazing!!!

I’ve eaten and made Black Forest cake my whole life ..from a box cake mix. This was soooo much better! The cherry cordial really made a difference in taste too, though it was expensive! Everyone gave it rave reviews! No problems with baking time or batter or filling being too runny either. It worked out just right as written!

This was an excellent recipe! The cake turned out very moist and had excellent chocolate flavour as well.
I made my own cherry filling from scratch though and used the assembly instructions from Black Forest Cake 1 however. This recipe will be used over and over again.

Great cake - moist and not too sweet, and so it blended so well with the sweet cherries and whip cream we added between the cakes and piped some dollops on the top.  

I would definitely make it again!

This chocolate cake was loved by everyone in my family.  Will never buy a box cake mix again.  This is super simple to make and delicious.  I used cake flour instead of AP by adding 
2 1/2 TBS extra flour but cant imagine that as written the recipe would result in anything different.  Thank you for this recipe!

I can't see why anyone would give a bad review on this cake! It is soooo moist and has abundance of flavor in every bite. If it is the baking time that isn't working out right, then just add 5-10 minutes more and keep an eye on it because that's what I did. It just takes common sense! Oh and if your cakes were too liquidy, it's because you didn't pay attention to the directions, meaning, it says to mix the ingredients until just incorporated. I have now made two of these cakes and without adding anything to it because it is very lusious and decadent without having to change a thing!

This was by far the best dessert I have ever made and eaten! I surprised my husband with this cake for his birthday and everyone was so impressed with how beautiful it looked! I didn’t have cherry liquor but instead used a few table spoons of almond extract. I am not a huge almond extract fan but it really added a delicious flavor to the cherry glaze.

I've made this recipe nomerous times and love it.  Looks like some steps are missing here.... like the assembly, whipped cream.  Maybe its in the video.

Yes I made it! This is the most moist and flavorful chocolate cake I have ever come across. It will be the only receipe I use for chocolate cake and I have passed it on to others.  I made it 'exactly' like the instructions said....but no alchol. I piped ring of chocolate frosting around each layer to hold the cherries in place. Finished it with dollops of whipped cream and chocolate butterflies with edible gold paint. Beautiful!

First time I made a cake from scratch in a long time, so I was a bit nervous.  I didn't have cherry liquor, but added the 1/2 ounce of almond extract.  Great reviews!  Cake was moist.  It was easy and prep went without a hitch.  I will get some cherry liqueur for next time.  Yummy!

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup and used light cherry pie filling.  Used rum as that's what I have. Garnished with freshly whipped cream and dust with chocolate powder.  Came out really nice.

This cake was delicious and moist! I used actual buttermilk instead of souring regular milk. And frosted with a whipped cream frosting. I never write reviews but this cake was worthy of one. There's always something I want to change about other recipes but this one is 100% perfect! You won't find a better more moist cake than this!

this is the worst recipe I have ever come across, the cake did not taste good at all, as a matter of fact it has no taste at all, it doesn't have any sweet flavor to it & it only taste like burnt coffee, I'm very upset with myself for changing my recipe at the last minute, it was the worst decision I made towards this cake, very DISAPPOINTED & UPSET. THUMBS DOWN, I'd rate this 0 if I could

One of the best cakes I have ever made! I did not have cherry liqueur so I omitted it. I also used buttermilk instead of sour milk, used a jar of homemade sour cherry pie filling, and made an almond-flavored whipped cream with almond extract, heavy whipping cream, and a little bit of powdered sugar for the frosting. To assemble I lined the layers with whipped cream, sandwiched the cherry pie filling, and decorated the top with the spare cream. Absolutely delicious--this recipe is a definite keeper.

Made this for Father's Day and the father's in the family loved it.   I followed this recipe, but I used the filling for the "Pretty Much a Piece of Heaven" recipe.  Turned out great and easy to make.  I agree that it should be made the night before because it tastes better the next day.

I make this cake every big event. It's become my family's favorite cake. It is rich and soft, but not too fluffy. Perfect. Plot twist:
I make a home made whip filling with seedless raspberry jelly and fresh raspberries. I also coat the cake with a semisweet chocolate ganache, and covered in fresh raspberries. The BEST way to enjoy this cake!! Enjoy !!!

This is the chocolate cake recipe I have used for the past 7 years.  Most of the time I just make it as a chocolate  layer cake.  I don't use the cherry pie filling or the cherry liqueur.  It is a moist delicious chocolate cake.  I have also made it as cupcakes and they turn out perfect.

Absolutely awesome!!! My daughter requested a Black Forest Cake for her 18th birthday and it was a hit! 
I did have the advantage of having a jar of homemade canned liqueur cherries which is what I used to flavor the cake (pouring the liqueur on the layers).  I added whip cream into the layers and iced with whip cream. Recommend!

I highly recommend for the cherry liqueur to use kirschwasser. This is the traditional liqueur for black forest cake as it's not sweet at all, and will especially help cut the sweetness of the canned cherry filling. Pie filling is much sweeter than tradition black forest cake cherries should be, and it will be much more so if you add maraschino liqueur and even worse if you use cherry brandy.

The cake itself was perfect, moist and rich without the butteriness or greasiness that many moist cakes have.

Good recipe. Nothing overly special. Taste better the next day, give chance for the cherry juice to soak into the cake. made with some fresh whip cream with a hint of almond extract.

Interesting idea and I followed the recipe exactly. Annnd it overflowed all over my oven and burned within 10 minutes.  I did taste some that had cooked on the side and it tasted good but not worth the hassle of cleaning my oven and not having any cake to show for it.

I make this once a year for my husband's birthday, and it is always a hit. :) I bought a bottle of Kirsch cherry liquor and soak cherries overnight in it. I also make whipped cream and top the cake with it. I think this cake tastes the best after it sits for a few hours in the 'fridge. It becomes super moist as the juice from the cherries soak in.

Made this for my first wedding anniversary. I didn't change anything about it, except I omit the cherry liquor, it was definitely the most delicious cake I have ever made! Husband and I have been thinking about it and talking about it for years! Our 5th anniversary was a few days ago. So, to celebrate, I have this cake in the oven right now. This time rather than use buttercream icing (which was very good with it!) I am going to use the cherry filling along with a layer of cool whip and cover the cake with cool whip as well and top with cherries. Can't wait! :)

Slighty difficult because I added 1 can of cranberry sauce. Thus increasing the volume of mix needed. I am doing a 3 layer cake for my father's birthday. I will everyone know how it turns out. What I mess I made in the kitchen!

UPDATE!!! Came out watery so I added some more flour, soda, and powder. Cooked the 3 layers in different sized pyrex pans. WOW!!! I am impressed with the skills. Taste was a little strong but close enough. Also had to leave in for 20 minutes longer. Really a gem of a project. Filling is not yet done.

I am not a big fan of cake but I loved this recipe.  So did everyone at the Christmas party I took it to!  Everyone raved about the cake and asked for the recipe, .  Cake was very moist and not too sweet.  I used 3 teaspoons almond extract rather than the cherry liqueur and added whip cream design on sides and top.

I adore this recipe. I have made it several (hundred) times over the past 3+ years and it has turned out perfect every single time! I am not a very experienced baker and this was one of the first cakes I made from scratch. It came out springy, spongey and moist...and I have been in love ever since. 

A couple of times I didn't have any cherry liqueur on hand - I used 1/2 cup of the liquid from the maraschino cherries jar, it worked out!

I tried this recipe last weekend using a 9X13 inch pan and the convection setting on the oven.  I was concerned about the liquidity of the batter (I am a VERY CAREFUL measurer.)but cooked it anyway.  It did not raise in the middle.  I found another recipe with a little more flour and buttermilk that turned out much better.

This cake was so easy to put together and absolutely delicious. There wasn't a piece leftover after serving. I followed another user's instructions and used a can of pitted sweet cherries and made a syrup from just a bit of the liquid, some white sugar, and a vanilla liqueur since I didn't have any Kirsch on hand. The cake batter was extremely thin going in to the oven but it baked perfectly and was one of the most moist cakes I've ever baked. I also made homemade whipped cream with a real vanilla bean. Guests could not stop raving about this cake!

I followed this recipe to a tee. Decorated it differently but kept everything else the same. This cake is so amazing I have made it 3 times in less than a month! It is so moist. Better than box cake and with ingredients I had in my pantry! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This is it!  This is the chocolate cake I have been searching for.    It's moist, sticky, and spongy. Since I don't have two 8 inch cake pans I used two 9 inch pans and it still baked well at 30 minutes.  I love how chocolatey it is.  It's intensely chocolate actually.  And kudos for the coffee addition, it does good things for the chocolate.  This recipe is definitely a winner.  My family enjoyed it very much and it didn't last long at all.  I already have requests to make another.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

I used the cake portion of this recipe and it was perfect. It was really chocolatey, moist, and not too dense. I didn't use this filling recipe.  I put cherries and whipped cream between the layers and frosted with a chocolate ganache frosting. I decorated the top of the cake with more cherries and whipped cream.

Thank you for this amazing recipe. I'd never made a cake from scratch before and this turned out perfectly!! It was seriously one of the most delicious cakes I've ever had.  I didn't use the cherry liqueur, just used plain cherry pie filling. I was in a hurry when I made it so I didn't try to make it look pretty but it didn't even matter because it tasted so good, everyone loved it! I also used real buttermilk instead of making sour milk. And I made whipped cream to frost the cake.

I love this recipe!  It is not like other black forest cake recipes:  no icing, no whipped cream.  It is dark and rich and full of the smell of Kirschwasser!  Very adult.  You can always add ice cream or whipped cream on the side for those who want more sugar, but I think it is just great as is.

A side note, I think the batter was kind of runny and so the cake was not quite done in the middle.  Next time I am going to cut back on the coffee, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 c. less.  But I don't think it hurt a thing in the long run!

Everyone loved this cake ! Very good recipe but I did make some changes. Used Buttermilk instead of the sour milk. Used 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon. Also used Cherry pie filling mixed with 1/4 cup Ki.            For filling . I used Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting recipe for frosting the sides of the cake. I filled the cake with the whipped cream but also put a little Kir.               And some Almond extract for a light cherry flavor. Loaded up the remaining cream and cherry filling on top and piped some cream around edges and tossed a little shaved chocolate on it. Beautiful and delicious!! From start to finish it took me about 3 hrs and 15 mins but worth it!!

The taste of this cake is awesome!  However, I live at high altitude and needed to add an extra egg, extra flour, little extra milk. Then placed entire batter into 8 inch cake pans. Thank goodness placed them on a cookie sheet. When I checked after about 20 minutes batter was bubbling out all over!  Once it was done and out of the oven I got to taste it and it's delicious if a little unconventional looking!

I Had followed every single step from this recipe and video as well.. except I add 3 table spoon of dark rum inside the cake batter and half cup.of rum into cherry fillings...doesn't look like the video.. moist cake...  mine look like hard like a rock chocolate rum cake.. .  took me 2 hours to make that cake plus spent another hour to make fresh chocolate whipped cream and cherries  to decorated the topping..

It was the first (successful) black forest cake I've made, and I was surprisingly pleased with the end result.  The batter smelled a bit burnt cooking in the oven (but the oven may have been on too high), and didn't wait long enough for them to cool before assembling, as I was in a rush.  I poached some canned cherries and poured the sugar syrup over the cake layers to moisten it, then layered and covered the cake in hand-whipped cream.  If I had timed things better, I think it would have been perfect!  It was delicious for the next few days, so I think I'd make it again.

The cake itself tasted good and was very moist.  Using 8" cake pans made the cake too high for my carrier. Next time I'll do 4 thin 9" cakes.  Of 11 people at the birthday party, no one liked the liqueur; everyone said they would have preferred just plain cherry pie filling.  We all agreed that we don't want this cake again.

I NEVER rate recipes on this site and I make at least one a week from this website but this recipe totally sucks! I wanted to use coffee in a recipe and came across this one. I LOVE black forest cake so I was excited to try it. I made it exactly according to instructions and the batter was  not cooked all the way thru when it came out. It fell apart and so I was not able to make it look nice...all I can really say is BOOOOOO! to this recipe

My family did not care for the cherries and liquor the first time I made it, so the second time I used chocolate mousse for the filling and a chocolate ganache for the top it was absolutely fabulous. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten!!! Really you can add any topping/ frosting you like and it will be good.

Hubby would like me to find a fresher alternative to cherry pie filling, and he would have preferred whipped cream in the construction of the cake.  Having said that, he had no trouble finishing off the leftovers.

This cake turned out to be the most delicious and easy chocolate cake I have ever made. I also didn't put in the liquor since it was going to be served to children. The filling I used was raspberry pie filling. I topped the cake with more raspberry pie filling surrounded on the edges of the cake with real whipped cream. The cake keeps very well in the refrigerator for a few days, too.

Made this and it came out real good.  I never made a multi layer cake before.  I goofed and added the kirchwasser to the batter, but was lucky i hadn't added the coffee, so I added less coffee.  I substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and lemon juice for the vinegar.  I had special dark cocoa, so that's what I used, but I ended up adding 1/4 cup more sugar to the batter to get it tasting sweet enough.  I think I cooked it for 45 min or so before it wasn't too wet inside.  I made a lower fat cream cheese icing, putting kirchwasser in it instead of vanilla, and it came out good, but I got bits of cake in it when I tried to spread it, and also had trouble with cherry from the filling getting into it on the sides where the layers join.  I added some whipped cream on top of the cherries on top, but don't do that if you aren't going to eat it quick because the whipped cream lost its fluffiness pretty quick.  I added mini chocolate chips on top so you don't notice the bits of cake in the icing.  Maybe I shouldn't have trimmed the top layer?  For a 1st try at making a cake it wasn't perfect, but tastes great.

OMFG, this cake is AWESOME. However, I added a tablespoon of almond extract to the batter. Also, I made my own improv filling with cream, frozen cherries, corn starch, and almond extract. Best cake I've ever made in my life. My 4 yr old got this as her birthday cake and she doesn't even know the awesomeness... :)

This is my favorite type of cake, and I wish I had more things to say about it. This is a hit every time, and if you like black forest cake, this is the one.

This cake was AMAZING! I didn't have any cherry liquor, so I just used a little Captain Morgan blended with powdered sugar, cream cheese and frozen cherries that I had.

I made this cake for my daughter but changed the icing for her, she wanted chocolate.  It came out wonderful.  The cake itself is so yummy!  Can't say enough good things about it.

Made for my husbands boss's birthday.  His boss love it, and requested that I make it for him next year.
