This recipe was great. I use gloucester cheese instead of velveeta type cheese. Very tasty way to serve brussel sprouts.

I'm on a mission to find a brussel sprouts recipe that convinces me to like brussel sprouts. This is the closest I've come so far:) The sprout loving family members DIDN'T like it, tho, because it masks the sprouts flavor. Go figure. This makes a lot of cheese sauce too-could maybe do half?!

Very bland. Reviews mostly added ingredients to address that, so I tried. I added sauteed onions and garlic with bacon to the Brussels sprouts, added some red pepper flakes and dijon mustard to the bechemel sauce, and even sprinkled a tiny bit of lemon juice over the Brussels sprouts mixture. I used an asiago/parmesan mixture in place of the Velveeta (I don't use processed cheese). Maybe an extra sharp cheddar instead would help. I ate this with oven roasted cherry tomatoes, which helped. I definitely will not make this again.

Good! Overall I liked how quick this was. I substituted bacon fat for the butter, added two broken up slices of bacon. I also used real cheddar cheese, and then broiled the mixture. I don't like my brussel sprouts quite so cooked so next time I think I will cook them for 5-7 minutes.

Just made this sauce for dinner - didn't have any cheddar cheese but i used half-n-half of Mozzarella and parmesan cheese instead.  It was wonderful and so easy.  Thank You.
