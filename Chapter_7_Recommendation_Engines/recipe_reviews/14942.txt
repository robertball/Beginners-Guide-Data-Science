Super easy recipe.  I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, and they always turn out wonderful.

I made this quick and easy recipe for a New Year's Party and it was great!
It was super easy and everyone liked it.  I doubled the recipe and used two types
of bbq sauce - one original KC masterpiece and one KC Masterpiece with hickory
brown sugar and the flavor was really good, not overwhelming at all.  I will 
make this one again, thanks for sharing!

This is a great and easy recipe. I made it for a Super Bowl party. I used 3 different BBQ sauces: Regular KC Masterpiece, KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar, and Gates BBQ sauce, and without the ketchup. Another way to do this is to cook the meatballs by themselves in the oven until hot and then put in the slow cooker with the BBQ sauces and keep warm until served.

I thought this was a delicious and easy way to whip up some meatballs. I used Simeks Meatballs, Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse BBQ Sauce (which has a little smokey flavor to it) and added the Ketchup and some Worcestershire Sauce and a sprinkle of Garlic Salt. Delicious.

I made my own meatballs instead of using frozen ones, so the cook time was a little longer (3.5 hours). These are great every time, and always seem to be the first thing  that disappears when company comes over. Great for the beginner, or those strapped for time. Add  2 table spoons of raspberry jam and a touch of honey for enhanced sweetness. Very good.

AMAZING!!!! I totally lied and said I made this from scratch!!! ;) This is a really amazing foundation for your own special customized bbq meatball recipe. I doubled the ingredients stated in the recipe and I also put my own twist on it. I think the brand of sauce is super important...I used Original Sweet Baby Ray's and Publix brand frozen meatballs...I also added an 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (un-drained), a tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder...AMAZING!! HUGE hit! The guys were licking their plates!... yum!!

This is a great, fast, easy recipe for the ingredients and cost.  It's no gourmet meatball, but the taste certainly outdoes  the prep work and time it takes to make, so I give it a 5 star.  The BBQ sauce is up to you, so choose well.  That ingredient will make or break your batch.

This one would probably be better with fresh meatballs.  The meatballs were mushy and the texture affected the taste.

Very good!  It is easy to see that you need to choose a BBQ sauce that is tasty to start with. Wonderfully easy.  This was not popular with children, however; it's more for adults.

We make these all the time for parties & family get togethers.  We just use the barbecue sauce with our's and let cook in the crock pot then turn down to warm during the party.  Everyone loves them.

These are very easy to make, and pretty good. The key is defintely using good bbq sauce. I also add in a couple packages of lil smokies, which turn out nice and juicy as well.

I was excited to make such an easy recipe, but I was disappointed to find the taste too tangy and too spicy.  The flavor was overwhelming (not in a good way).  Needs to be toned down somehow.

These were delicious. Next time I make this I'm going to use a different BBQ sauce. I used Jack Daniel's Spicy Original last time and the flavor was a bit too strong.

The sauce didn't taste the way I'd hoped, I added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce for a bit more flavor.  Turned out nice, very easy.

Yummy yummy! Couldn't do any stirring as my meatballs tried to slightly fall apart if I did. Maybe I need to do something differently next time? I'm a beginner cook so I'm not gonna beat myself up over it. Other than that it was great and I'll most likely attempt it again another day!

Made for New Year's Eve party---everyone praised me for such a great dish/appetizer! You don't have to use precise measurements---just do what you think is right and adjust the flavor to your preference!

These meatballs were fantastic.  So easy, I just added the bbq sauce, ketchup and meatballs into my slow cooker and didn't have to worry about them until the guests arrived.  Everyone loved them and they smelled wonderful while cooking.

for how easy it was it was absolutely delicious. The taste was around a 4 but the simplicity bumped it to a 5. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

These were good! They are super simple to make, and everyone liked them! I didn't give 5 stars just because I didn't think they were out of this world good or anything, it's basically just BBQ sauce on meatballs. But I can't complain! :) Will make again!

Could not be easier, I was looking for a quick slow cooker meatball recipe and this fit the bill! I used Foster Farms turkey meatballs, and per other reviews added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Leftovers are good cold in sandwiches. Thank you, will make these again!

I made this for my husband and he really liked it. I didn't use a slow cooker but instead let the meatballs simmer in a pot on the stove for 1 hour. I served them over white rice. Very easy.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce as my family did not want it to be spicy.

Very simple recipe. Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce based on other reviews. This was a simple recipe & people liked it, but they didn't LOVE it. I still had some leftovers at the end of the party. But for throwing a few ingredients in a crock pot, I was pleased.

People like my husband who don't mind pre-prepared food (which tends to be saltier) will love this recipe, since the ingredients really are all pre-processed. I usually prefer a more home-made flavour, but the easiness of the recipe more than made up for the store bought nature of it. I made it for the last family gathering at my house, everyone agreed it was tasty. Next time I will try the same technique with chicken wings instead of meatballs.

Easy and delicious. Followed the recipe - used bottled sauce from a local BBQ restaurant; guessed at the ketchup. Put in a pretty dish, grabbed the long party toothpicks and brought it to the neighbors. Everyone loved them!

I opted to do this on the stove for time purposes. I didn't have enough BBQ sauce so I added about 1/4 French dressing. Kids ages 2&7 gobbled it up. Served over white rice per someone else's suggestion.

I am sure this is lovely but Meatballs are the easiest thing to make! If you have to buy them packaged then it is not even a recipe imo.

The only thing I did differently is that I put everything into a large pot on the stove, low to medium heat at first and then down to low for about an hour and it turned out perfectly!  My kids and I LOVED it!
