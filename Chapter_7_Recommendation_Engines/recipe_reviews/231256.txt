I'm giving this 5 stars based on two criteria; first the spices are (largely) the same ingredients found in commercial pickling spice and secondly, I boiled some on the stove and the smell was wonderful (like a good pickling spice should be.) Not sure of the economics of making it, that would depend where you buy spices. I had ran out of the bottled variety and made this in a pinch.

Had an abundance of cucumbers in the garden and decided to make some pickles. I didn't have any pickling spice made up and this recipe was just the ticket!! Thanks for posting. Great recipe!

I used this pickling spice to make Pop's pickles (recipe also on AllRecipes.com).  The farmer's market was out of pickling spice, so I pulled up the first recipe I could find on Google and bought all the ingredients.  Two weeks later the first jar of pickles was opened, and my friends declared them "Christmas pickles" because they taste like Christmas.  This was a bit too cinnamon-y for both myself and the BF, so next time I'll try and leave out the sticks.  Overall, though, this is a pretty decent recipe.

I used this "Homemade Pickling Spice" recipe for making pickled eggs (Allrecipes, Popa's Pickled Eggs, bd.weld). They taste excellent! Thank you Mooseinthekitchen for sharing your recipe.

Fantastic ! My grocery was out of standard pickling spice so I used this less the clove- I figured enough goodness with cinnamon and ginger. Made 2 giant batches and combined with garlic, jalape√±os, fresh dill sliced carrots and white onion with the cucumbers.  Everyone is crazy for these pickles! Thank you!

This ended up working perfectly for the fridge pickles I made today! Very easy to put together, and a nice, small amount in the end(doesn't clutter up the cupboards this way).  Thanks for sharing, it was a lifesaver!

I found out I was out of commercially made Pickling Spice and as usual, Allrecipes was a saviour!
I will be making this from now on when I need it. I usually have all these spices on hand. It smells great in the beet and horseradish that is now simmering on the stove waiting to be canned. :)

Not bad, but the cinnamon was overpowering.  Will try again, with significantly less cinnamon.

Thank you for  sharing this. While it is  (or maybe) just like the store bought pickling spice,  it was just what I was looking for. I ran out of my store bought pickling spices and it  was a very snowy day, so no running out to the store for more, so I used this recipe. Perfect!

This worked! Handy, as I didn't have any pre -made pickling spice for another recipe I was making.
