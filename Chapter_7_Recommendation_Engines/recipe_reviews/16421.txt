This was the best bruschetta I've ever made! I made it twice, once with onions and once without. I think I'd go with half the amount of onion the next time since the onion dominated the other tastes. Overall, it was very delicious.

This is a great twist on the classic tomato-based bruschetta. The balsamic vinegar gives it a little extra bite, while the roasted peppers lend a savory sweetness. Definitely a big hit at parties.

Enjoyed this. My husband thought it needed some parmesan cheese on top so I experimented with some remaining pieces. Put shredded parmesan and popped back in the oven -- he liked it better this way but I liked it the other. Also dipped my French bread slices (one side) in the olive oil and then rubbed another slice with the first piece.

Excellent and easy appetizer.  Didn't have italian bread so i used texas toast and cut into 4 squares. Worked out nice. Added some chopped up black olives for color. Delicious and will definately make again and again. :)

This is absolutley delicious!! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using a couple teaspoons of dried basil, because I didn't have any fresh, and I added 1 Tablesppon of parmesan to the mixture. Be sure to top the bread right before serving because it will get a bit soggy if sitting for awhile. I may toast both sides of the bread next time. I'll be using this recipe often, I couldn't stop eating this. During the summer I plan to roast my own pepeprs, using a blend of yellow, orange and red. This would look beautiful on a platter for summer picnics and barbeques. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)

Although I did alot of tweaking, I still must say this wasn't what I thought it would be.  It was edible, but not irresistable.

If you go for the jar of peppers, don't be afraid to use the whole thing!  It seemed like a ton so I just added half, then mixed in a little more, then a little more...  ended up using the whole thing.  Next time I will do the roasted peppers myself but this time I ran out of time.  Great appetizer in a pinch!!  Definitely sprinkle with grated Parm :)

Yummy stuff. I roasted my own red peppers and used softened sun dried tomatos (no fresh on hand). We really enjoyed this on toasted french bread.

I followed the recipe almost exactly but roasted fresh peppers myself rather than using jarred. It was terrific as an appetizer before Christmas dinner. I spread some leftover homemade basil-walnut pesto on the baguette slices before topping with the bruschetta mixture. The combination of flavors was fabulous.

I'm generally not a fan of balsamic vinegar and it appealed to me even less here, so I left it out.  While these additions certainly weren't necessary to an already great recipe, adding a little mozzarella took this over the top.  (I sometimes add sliced black olives to this too!)

My boyfriend scarffed a whole plate of this stuff. I didn't use a whole onion though and I like mozarella a lot so I added a little shredded on top. The peppers are a fantastic idea. thanks.

Used a lot less basil and just a little onion.  Served this with "Paris toast" instead of the Italian bread.  It's all ready to go and makes this a quick and easy recipe.

Quite good! Received many compliments.  However, as a matter of preference, I think the roasted red peppers are too sweet. Would suggest increasing the ratio of tomatoes to peppers.

I used the directions on this site to make my own roasted sweet red peppers.  http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/roasting-peppers/detail.aspx
I used both red and yellow peppers.  I did use the onion, but forgot about the onion.  Very tasty and my bf went back for seconds.

This was a great appetizer.  I used only a bit of onion, used sweet Thai basil and did not put together until the absolute last minute so they wouldn't get soggy.  They were a big hit and I will definitely make them again soon!

I mixed ingredients from this recipe with another.  It turned out fantastic.  Everyone enjoyed.  Love roasted red peppers.  Yum!
