Great tasting dish, creamy, and full of herb flavor.  Only complaint is that it's hard to control the potatoes from getting burned, need to keep a close eye on them at all times.  Also, requires a very large pan in order for everything to cook properly.  Overall, it is definitely worth making this.

This recipe is easy and delicious--and I even used the 98% fat free version of the cream of chicken soup because it's all I had on hand.  This recipe was much better than I imagined it would be--my husband loved it too.  I made delicious homemade style biscuits to go with it and eating pieces of biscuit mixed in with this meal reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  The only thing I would mention is that it is not 4 large servings.  It was fine for my family because my two children are preschool age and don't eat a lot.  I imagine if you have four very hungry adults, you may want to increase the ingredients.

Instead of 1/2 cup of milk, use 1/2 cup of broth (canned, chicken or beef is fine).  Then, at the end, stir in 1/4 to 1/2 half cup of sour cream (low-fat is fine) and heat through.  Much more savory/tangy flavor!

This was okay, I thought it would be better considering the rave reviews. After I arranged the frozen veggies on top as the recipe suggested, I had to simmer longer than five minutes in order for them to become tender.  As a result, it scorched.  Rather than arranging them on top, I think it would be better to stir them in and keep stirring occaisionally through the end of the cooking process.  It would probably be a good idea to thaw the veggies first.  I skimmed the good stuff off the top and salvaged most of the meal.  Overall, I found it a little bland, but salt and more spices will fix that.  Also, next time I will omit the potatoes and use noodles.

This was delicious!  I used a can of diced new potatoes instead of slicing up my own.  That worked perfectly!  The spices gave the dish such a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Yummy recipe. I did a few changes because of what I had on hand. For seasonings I just used the parsley, Basil, garlic and onion powder. I didnt have the frozen vegi's but I dont think my picky eaters would have enjoyed it as much anyway. I used lots of grated chedder instead of parmasean on the top right at the end. My family really loved and the kids even wanted seconds. Wow!!

This was a really tasty dish that my whole family loved. I cooked the chicken breasts in the microwave, then cut it up. I also precooked the vegetables a bit. I used seasoned salt. I also used fat free milk to make it low fat. We served it over rice. Thanks!

This was sooo good! My husband and I loved it! I made some changes that I can recommend: I omitted carrots (personal taste), omitted potatoes and went straight to cooking chicken, using only 1Tblsp. oil., added another 1/2C onion (looks like a lot, but trust me!), and used one full cup of skim milk with healthy request campbells cr. of chicken soup.  It came out low fat and so delicious. We put it over wide egg noodles and viola. Thank you for a great, quick idea!

It has become a weekly recipe for our family.
I change the taste by changing the soup that I add to the recipe. ie: cream of mushroom, cream of celery...

I didn't make this the "fast" way, I used fresh carrots and broccoli.  But that was okay, because this was delicious.  I about doubled this recipe for my big family and it was nearly gone when dinner was over.
***I've now made this recipe three times, each time my kids tell me "You should make this more often!".  I've used frozen veggies and fresh, canned chicken, fresh chicken...all ways has been very good.  My note: LOAD up the vegetables...I use more than the recipe calls for.

This meal took over an hour to prepare, so there is nothing "last minute" about it.  I cooked the potatoes (4!) over 30 minutes and they still were not tender.  And one can of soup was not enough.  The potatoes absorbed all of the liquid and the chicken was very dry.  I even doubled the milk.  The flavor was good, but this recipe needs a lot of changes.

Uh, notsogood.  I guess it's a matter of creamofsomething soup dislike.  I've only found one recipe that's any good with soup in it.  It was good because you couldn't taste it.  Adding wine would improve it, I'm sure; but I'm not trying it again.

considering all of the impressive reviews for this recipe i didn't think it was all that great.  i used 4 medium sized red potatoes and three chicken breasts and it made a huge amount of food.  i doubled the sauce ingredients because it looked too dry, and i'm glad i did.  i added peas and cauliflower and that veggie combo was good with the sauce.  overall i just didn't think this was anything that stood out.

This recipe is great.  I made it for my family and they really liked it.  One thing I will change the next time I make it is, I will only use califlower.  The califlower mixed well and tasted best with this dish.

This was a hit with my (young) kids! This is a big deal for me! I had no potatoes, but I made it anyway and served it over egg noodles. Yum! I was disappointed that I couldn't make it with the potatoes, but I don't think the kids would have liked it as well with them! I will definitely make this again (one way or the other)! Thanks!

Easy, fast and flexible. Cream of anything soup, canned, frozen or fresh potatoes, whatever cheese you have open, and a bag of frozen vegetables. I made on the stove top then put into a casserole dish and crumbled crackers on top. It was fantastic and EASY! Will definitely fall back on this recipe again soon.

I loved this!  Made it for the first time tonight but didnt go by the exact measurements cause I just never do.  I used 5 chicken breasts, 2.5 cans of cream of mushroom and a can and a half of milk.  I think.  The milk I eye balled so I'm not sure.  And then the spices I added much much more.  I like lots of flavor so I quadrupled the amount.  Came out amazing.  Lots of flavor and so comforting.  Oh and I threw in egg noodles with it.  Family LOVED it!

I've made this recipe several times since we first found it. It is now one of my family's favorites! Sometimes I use canned, pre-sliced potatoes to save time. Also, I rarely have the exact spices called for, so I'll often substitute Italian seasoning which tastes great! The crisp golden crunch on the outside of the potatoes is a perfect compliment to the soft chicken and vegetables. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was truly delicious. The only thing that I did differently is add a can of corn, my daughter has to see corn amidst all those veggies. Needless to say the addition was awesome, so will definitely make this again!

Easy to make, nice texture, but not much flavor. Definitely needs salt and something else to give it some zing.

This recipe is creamy and easy to make. My husband really loved it. He liked it better than I did, but I did like it, and I will be making it again occasionally. I like the blend of vegetables and I did find it easy to make. I used fresh veggies, so I covered the pan for a while to steam the veggies because I had a hard time getting them tender otherwise.

The only reason I might make this again is because my kids ate it without a fuss, which is a good thing, particularly since it includes more than one food group!  It's bland unless you really play with the seasoning and the first step involving the potatoes takes at least 20 minutes.

I made it more like a baked caserole but i did fry the potatoes stove top, adding spices, layered on the bottom of a dish, added the rest of the ingrediants on top and popped it in the oven.

This was a very satisfying meal due to a few add-ons. I made biscuits to go along with the dish, which were delicious to dip in the cream of chicken soup "sauce". Also, I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese (sparingly) over the top of everything. This REALLY helped with the flavor. Next time I make this, I think I'll skip the milk. I'd like for the sauce to be thicker and not so runny. Adding some flour to the soup should help make it thicker. All in all, this was great.

I wanted to make something different for my son & me, but I'm not very creative.  I had all the ingredients needed for this dinner.  I loved it.  The only thing I did different was to add the onions with the potatos.  We like onion flavor, but not the actual onion.  Then I took the onions out and did everything else the same.  I even got my son to eat the cauliflower!  I had enough left over for lunch the next day.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste and ease. Great recipe!! I didnt have marjoram, and I added whole fresh mushrooms. Everyone went back for seconds. This will go into rotation at my house! I made homemade drop biscuits, and we tore them up and put them in the mix. This is a versatile recipe that can take whatever veggies and spices your family prefers.

I made thid tonight for dinner.  I changed it a bit.  I used mushroom soup, and a mix of broccoli and cauliflower, no carrots, and half a bag of frozen peas.  I tasted it and thought that it was quite bland.  So I added a little Red Hot, some worcestershire sauce and some ketchup.  That helped out a little!  I think that if I make it again I will not use the potatoes and serve it over noodles.

This was very good.  I only had brocoli and I did not have all of the spices so I improvised.  I did add salt and I baked it in the oven for 1/2 hour after I combined all of the ingredients.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

The family loved it! It was absolutely delicious!

I doubled the herb ingredients and added cracked pepper. I also cooked the chicken before adding it. And I simmered it for about 15 minutes instead of 5.

This was terrific!!! I read the reveiws before I made this. Most people said to try with Rice or Eggnoodles instead of potatos. I used eggnoodles, and I used garlic salt instead of powder and I had No carrots. took about 30minutes. My boyfriend even loved it and hes a picky eater too ! ^____^ tasty!

The husband and kids (7 & 2) enjoyed this recipe although I think if I made it again I would omit the potatoes, as they took to long to cook.  I would instead serve the dish wth rice.

My family loved this recipe, but I changed it up just a bit.  We didn't have condenced soup so I "made" my own.  I used aprox. 2 tablespoons of butter and melted and added flour for a typical cream sauce.  I added less flour than normal so that it was just barely a paste.  I added in milk to make it just shy of soupy.  2 chicken bulion cubes and a 1/3 cup of sour cream.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same.

this is a pretty good base recipe - i used cr. of potato, because that's what i had, so i used chicken bouillon instead of the milk. i sauteed the onion with the chicken, and used quartered baby carrots which i cooked along with the potatoes (i don't care for frozen carrots!), fresh garlic went in with the chicken and onions, and i skipped the parmesan entirely because it seemed out of place. it was enjoyed by all, including the 3-year-old!

This was great!  I did end up adding more of the spices by accident (not one to measure when cooking) and I added some roasted red pepper I had on hand.  I also used an 8oz container of sour cream instead of the milk.  I mixed the frozen vegetables in with it and added a bit of water and let it cook down so the veggies would cook.  I didn't realize I didn't have parmesan and hadn't put it in till we were already eating it and oooing and ahhhing over it.  My son doesn't like parmesan anyway so when I make it again, I will have it as an optional topping.  It is yummy!

This was a tasty and fast meal to prepare for those busy nights during the week! And it was hearty enough for my husband. I did change the recipe a tad by adding fat free cream of chicken soup and using skim milk. I also put mine over rice. I will definitely be making this again!

My husband & I thought this was great.  I used what I had on hand which was turkey breast & fresh veggies so I had to change the time I cooked it but the spices were delicious.  (I love salt so I had to add a bunch but that's just me)

I thought it was just okay; the rest of my family didn't care for it at all. I used marsala cooking wine in place of the milk and stirred in frozen mixed vegetables instead of topping with the carrot/broccoli/cauliflower blend. I thought the marsala was the tastiest part of the dish.

WOWZA! I was going through my recipe box and was like "oh i need t o review this" I click on it and there is my pic of the recipe!! My first photo scrap book it LOL. Anywho, this was soooo good, I cannot wait until I make it right! I accidently bought the mixed veg with green beans, corn, carrots, and peas. So it tasted kinda like a open chicken pot pie. It was tasty.

What an incredible dinner!  I threw this together at the last minute and it was totally worth it.  The only changes I made was not adding marjoram, parmesan, and I only used brocolli because it was all that I had on hand and I didn't have the other ingredients.  The only suggestion that I have is adding some garlic salt or plain salt to the dish when it's cooking.

Everyone I made this for raved about it!! Couple things - I had to add extra milk (quite a bit extra) to compensate for the amount of potatoes in the recipe and I didn't have regular chicken, so I used breaded chicken fingers chopped up. Otherwise it is fantastic!

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken because it was what I had on hand! I skipped the onion and garlic powder entirely and added 2 cloves of sauteed garlic instead. Right before serving it, I added some torn fresh basil and freshly ground black pepper. This is simple, delicious comfort food!

I tried this recipe for the first time after reading other reviews and didn't think it would be very memorable but to my surprise it was quite good.  I didn't make any major changes, just added salt and pepper during the cooking stages. My husband and son who are impossible to satisfy devoured it.  I didn't even have a chance to take a picture.  I will keep this one the next time I am stumped on what to do with chicken.

MY BUNCH DID NOT LIKE THIS VERY WELL. HAD A LOT OF LEFT-OVERS. THE NEXT NIGHT I ADDED A CAN OF MIXED VEGS AND A CAN OF CHICKEN BROTH. SIMMER IT FOR ABOUT 20 MINS THEN ADDED A CAN OF CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP. IT MADE A WONDERFUL POT OF CHICKEN STEW.

As is, this recipe is more like 3 stars, but if you use your cooking wit, you can make it into more of a 4. The idea is a good idea and therefore, I used the idea. But what I did with the idea and what I added is more like a whole new recipe! So, I won't go into detail, just quickly: probably wouldn't use potatoes next time. Steamed fresh broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in steamer and added to chicken and sauce a few minutes before serving. I think this makes it MUCH better. Those frozen veggies sometimes put off a weird taste into the dish they are cooked in. Added some cheddar cheese along with the Parm. Added some extra seasoning, too. All in all, after the changes, my family liked this. Thanks for the good idea.

I used fresh brocoli, instead of frozen mix, and garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  With a little extra salt and pepper it was a good meal.  Kids even ate it, which is saying a lot.

This is a very good meal, however, I think it lacks a little salt.  It also takes about 30 minutes just for it all to cook up - not 15 minutes.  But all together it's great.  Potato's, meat and your vegies all in one.  GOOD DEAL!

We liked this but to make this really easy I just threw some chicken breasts on the good ole George Foreman Grill and then chopped them up.  I fried up some frozen hashbrowns instead of slicing potatoes, and Voila! Easy and simple dinner that the family liked.

Great spices.  I found that it is better and less mushy if you boil potato cubes and then spoon the sauce over top instead of adding it in with the cooking.

I used a 16oz. package of frozen STIR-FRY vegies... I think they added more to the recipe.

my husband and i really liked this (and he never likes anything). I did make some changes though. 
i took a can of sliced new potatoes and i fried those in the oil. I wasn't sure how they would be in the mix so I kept them as a side dish (husband loved them separated). 
For the veggies, i had 12 oz of frozen broccoli so I steamed that in the microwave. I cut up 5 carrots and boiled it in chicken broth and drained them. Didn't have cauliflower.
I cooked the onions in oil until clear and soft. i also thought that was a lot of onion for the recipe, and I'm a big onion fan. i put about 3/4 of the onion in but i think next time i'd do 1/2 of an onion.
I didn't have marjoram so I used 1/8 tsp of oregano. I sprinkled on some more parsley as well. 
I didn't add the parmesan but left it as a topping that could be sprinkled over as an option. And i'm glad i left it out, although i'd like to try it in the sauce one day. 
Served over noodles. Took me about ~1.5 hours

Very good.  I used carrots and celery since I didn't have frozen veggies.  Just sauteed them in some chicken broth first.  I also used half more all the spices for extra flavor, and dbl the cheese. Yum!

Good with some extra seasoning.  I added no-salt spice mix to the potatoes and to the soup mixture.  I used veggies I had on hand (frozen broccoli, peas/carrot mixture.  Next time might switch to cheddar cheese soup and or add some cheddar on top.  Tasty, easy, and very adaptable!

Wow this is what I fantasize about when I'm truly hungry, like when I'm coming down the mountain from a long hike.  The prep time was more like 35 mins for me.  Most of the time is taken up by cubing the chicken and thinly slicing the potatoes.  Once you make it, you will understand that this dish could be made differently every time and still be fantastic.  (Alternate what kind of soup, what vegetables, etc.)  I put mine over basmati rice.

Ok........I like the fact that potatoes are used in this dish instead of pasta or rice which you seem to find in every chicken recipe out there.  That gets old and I like variation.  This dish is really good, but in my opinion, not good enough for all the time and effort it takes going into it.  My variations to this recipe:  Mushroom soup instead of Chicken (I had to improvise)....canned evaporated milk instead of regular (I am not a milk drinker so it just spoils if I buy it), I only used frozen broccoli and then I grated fresh Parmesan to mix in.  I also added pepper and some cajun spice seasoning to give it a little "flavor."  (If any of you have read my other reviews, by now you have figured out I like cajun spice seasonings).  LOL  All in all, it is good comfort food, but not something to make if you are in a hurry to put something on the table.

A very quick, one-dish meal. To stop the potatoes from sticking, I had to reduce the heat to medium-low, but adding more oil would probably work also. I used fresh broccoli and carrots as opposed to the frozen mix with no problem. Larger quantities of the spices helped, also.

Loved the idea! Just a few small changes on my part: I peeled the potatoes, sliced them about 3/4" & then cut them in half. I oven roasted them until done (separately seasoned). I personally feel about carrots the way most people feel about liver (which I love!) so I removed them from the veggie blend. I added sliced red bell pepper for color and diced Portobello for added flavor.
To me these were minor tweaks. The original recipe sounded so good I had to try it & so glad I did.

I had some leftover chicken breast and pork loin. I diced up both, threw in some diced Yukon Gold potatoes and a pack of frozen vegetables. I used cream of mushroom soup as that is what I had on hand. It came out really well. My wife declared it a keeper.

Very easy and fast!  I used a shortcut and purchased the chicken already cubed.  Doubled the recipe to feed 6.  Came out with a bit more sauce than expected.  Sauce is very flavorful! I will be making this again!

Great dish! Just made it for the fam. I would change just two things about the recipe. A whole onion is too much in my opinion (I will make it with 1/2 next time). Also, like another reviewer mentioned, it takes longer than 5 minutes for the onions and broccoli to cook through (make sure you have a cover big enough for your skillet).

this is an easy fast dish and it is super yummy.  I added a little Montreal steak seasoning to the potatoes as I cooked them and skipped the salt and pepper.  very tasty dish!  thank you for recipe.

Loved this recipe! I usually use a homemade savory "italian" spice blend, but it's great either way. I cut the potatoes a little smaller than the chicken so they cook before the chicken dries out.

Made a few changes....I used canned sliced potatoes after seeing comments about them burning because they took so long to cook, I used mushroom soup instead of chicken soup, added a pack of mushrooms, 1/4 tsp of salt, 1/8 tsp of pepper, and used different veggies. Oh and added extra shredded parm. Soooo good.

I cooked the potatoes and added some water to keep them from sticking, added onion then added chicken. I added salt and pepper lots of garlic powder.  Then added the rest. I mixed everything up so it wouldn't burn. I also added water because I didn't want it super thick. It came out lovely, definitely making this again!!!!

The taste of the finished dish is good.  The problem is with the potatoes; the instructions suggest high heat to start; it would be best to start with a low to medium to give the potatoes a change to cook and not burn.  Once the potatoes are cooked if you want them crispy turn up the heat and brown them.

I made this with some slight alterations. I cooked it in the crockpot. I also used 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2. I also used salt, pepper, and another grill time seasoning I have used on chicken before. Then, I served over rice. It truly was good, not fantastic though. Will do again because of ease.

I keep the ingredients on hand for those nights when we're rushed.  I make my own cream of chicken soup to go into it, instead of the canned, but that only takes a few extra minutes.   Family friendly, all of my kids like this.  It's a good basic meal that's quick to prepare.

Can control potato scorching if you saute in an oil like grapeseed oil...hard to burn things in this oil. Still have to stir! Veggies take longer than 5 minutes to soften!

Last Minute Chicken Dinner Haiku: "Just a bit more work than to call it 'last minute.' Not our favorite." Used all of the ingredients as written, only my chicken was from a large batch that I'd prepared, shredded, and frozen previously in individual portions. We all ate this w/o murmurs of "mmms" or any enthusiastic praise, so it's unlikely it'll make another appearance in the kitchen, but I was glad to try out a new dish anyways!

I am with the minority here that thought this was a pretty good jumping off point but not 4/5 stars "great".  A good base recipe to expand upon.

First off, it definitely was not ready in 25 minutes.  Allow close to an hour, which is still pretty good by dinner prep standards.  Secondly, for the size of portions we typically eat, it serves way more than 4; you may want to adjust the portions/ingredients considerably if you don't want to have a lot of leftovers.

I made the recipe pretty close to the instructions, with these variations:
 - fresh broccoli & carrots instead of frozen
 - chunky cuts of potato instead of thin slices
 - 1 tbsp oil instead of 2
 - more (unmeasured) parmesan

After the recipe was 'done,' I added the following:

 - several shakes of salt
 - several grinds of pepper
 - two cloves of pressed garlic
 - approx. 1 tbsp marjoram
 - approx. 1 tbsp sage

With 10 more minutes of simmering, this was good to go.  White wine would be a nice addition, as would rosemary and some butter. Thanks for posting and happy cooking.

Excellent dish.  However, next time I make it I won't used prepared soup.  I'd rather have less salt content.  I'll make a roux with my own chicken stock instead.

The recipe was great. My boyfriend and I could not stop eating! I made some adjustments of course. First I seasoned the chicken over night with seasoned salt, powdered jerk seasoning, and powder garlic. I sprinkled some dry parsley and powder garlic while they were cooking. I used fresh broccoli and carrots and omitted the cauliflower. I did the broccoli separate and then added it towards the end. I also mixed in the marjoram, basil, parsley, and seasoned salt while it was cooking instead of adding it towards the end. And to finish it off, made basmati rice to eat along with it.

My husband said this was a awesome recipe, I used garlic salt and Italian spices instead of the recommended one.  My son on the other hand is not a potluck kid.  He ate it but was not thrilled that everything was mixed together.  I told him too bad that I would be making it again.

This was pretty good. I didn't put in the onion because I don't really like it, but I think I'll put a little in next time for even more flavor. I put in  some extra garlic and I think next time I'll try some fresh garlic too. Very good though!
