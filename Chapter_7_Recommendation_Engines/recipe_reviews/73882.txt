I am a bartender, i have served a version of this drink with great results.  In order to get a real upside-down cake flavor, add amaretto.  watch out for grenadine.  Some complain of being too sweet.  I serve it as a cocktail with a splash of cranberry. (offsetts the sweetness, adds the color that grenadine does.) I named it pineapple upside-down cake because it totally reminded me of one of my favorite desserts.

A very, very good drink, but only if you make it right. First off, it MUST have Amaretto to make it taste like a real pineapple upside down cake. Usually a heavy splash or so. Second, use very good vanilla vodka. I've tried it with cheap vodka, and you can't taste the vanilla, which really makes or breaks this drink. You might be able to get away with regular vodka and a light splash of vanilla extract, but I really suggest the vanilla vodka.

Very, very good. I added a touch of amaretto and it was just like a pineapple upside down cake. I'd make this again and again.

HOOCHIE MAMMA! These little drinky-poos will have you licking your lips while watching the room spin in no time flat.  Delish but potent! I couldn't find pineapple juice (I live in the boonies) so used pineapple cocktail juice instead (pineapple, passion, mango)...also didn't have vanilla vodka so just added a couple drops of Watkins vanilla and as another review suggested, 1/4 cup of amaretto.  Wow! My girlfriend and I took one sip and knew we were in for trouble! Our hubbies found them too sweet - so this is definitely one for the gals.  Enjoy!

Loved it! I used some of the juice from the cherries instead of grenadine just because I'm lazy. ;o) Even hubby enjoyed one of these. Thanks for the recipe!

Holy cow were these good!  I had a girl's night out party at my house and decided to give these a try.  It's almost scary how easy they were to make let alone how fast they were gone! I agree, they do smell and taste like the real deal.

Not only did this not taste anything remotely resembling pineapple upside down cake, it didn't taste much like pineapple at all; its flavor almost totally obliterated by the grenadine.  I made this for my wife who said this would have been infinitely better had I omitted the grenadine completely and added a splash of simple syrup.  I have to agree.

This drink is the bomb.com!! LOL I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a splash of cranberry juice to cut the too sweet flavor.

I make sure to always keep the ingredients for this drink on hand!

I agree with the last reviewer.  Does not really taste like pineapple upside down cake but more like just pineapple.  Good but not one of my favorites.  Thanks

I made these and found the vanilla vodka a bit strong for my taste, but with the additional of more pineapple juice and grenadine they were very refreshing.  I love how they smell like the cake.  It is a really good idea, thank you.

As a another reviewer suggested (the bartender) I added a splash of Amaretto, only because I had some handy.  It's sweet and yummy...and yes, liquid cake!  My husband is a new martini drinker, and he says it's "interesting".  But he hasn't given it to me, so that tells me the sweetness is not over the top.  I will definitely make this again!

I have made this many times, and although I love cherry flavor, if you shake it with the grenadine, it totally takes over the drink. My fiance has a neat way (and some bartenders have done it too) of pouring the grenadine in and it will float at the bottom. that way you can kind of stir it in gradually so you dont miss out on the great pineapple and vanilla flavors! this also keeps the sweetness down! YUM YUM!!!!

Great HIT at parties * with one note:
Stir BEFORE adding grenadine, then drop in at the last minute to make it really 'look' like Pineapplie Upside-down cake in a Martini glass. Very cool!

We tried about 5 martini recipes from recipes.com and this one by far was the biggest hit!  Amazing how much it tastes just like a pineapple upside down cake.  My husband doesn't even like to drink and he liked this one.

I searched for this because I have this drink at a great beachfront restaurant in Long Branch, NJ.  They use amaretto.  It IS a sweet drink, but I love it. I agree with adding the grenadine last for the effect.

Good as it is, but with a name like "pineapple upside down cake martinis," I expected something a bit more decadent and authentic. I will work on this recipe, but as it is, it just tastes like a generic tropical vodka drink.

These were mighty yummy. Perhaps my friends and I are getting too old - but they also held quite a kick! I might take advice and "water" them down with some additional juice - cranberry or some other mixer.

These were very good!  I'm not usually a fan of martinis but this was more like a punch.  We made these for a party and instead of making individual martinis, we just put all the ingredients in a pitcher and it turned out really good and was very simple and all the girls loved it.

I really like this.  I only had regular vodka and it was fine!  Opened a can of pineapples, added some pineapple and marachino juice.  Added a bit of pineapple and a cherry.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this drink with 4 ounces of pineapple juice/2 ounces of vanilla vodka. I substituted MARASCHINO CHERRIES—along with some of the juice drizzled down the inside of the glass—for the grenadine, and added about an ounce of Torani almond syrup.  This is a DELICIOUS drink! (I do agree with the others, though, that an almond flavoring—I only had the Torani's, no amaretto—needs to be added in order for this to really taste like pineapple upside down cake. It has too much of a bite without it.)

I have made this drink several times for different gatherings.  This phenomenal drink is so close to a pineapple upside down cake taste that guys and girls actually wait in line for it.  I followed the basic recipe using  a higher end vanilla vodka, amaretto, and a snap of grenadine.  Absolutely fantastic and a real hit to my parties!  Thanks to the original contributor and the suggestions to use good vodka and amaretto!

This was a 3.5 in my opinion. I think others have hyped this up too much. I added the amaretto as others suggested. Some said a splash? So I added a half ounce. It smelled really good, but the taste was just okay. I will probably it again, but it would not be my first choice.

I had one a pineapple upside down cake martini last weekend at a local restaurant --- it was delicious!  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the bartender that made it   :(   I tried this recipe. It was delicious but did NOT taste like the cake martini of last weekend.  How much amaretto is used?  Anybody ever heard of trying this made with either fluff vodka or whipped cream vodka?  I think that may be what was used..... I'm still on my quest.  Again, this was a great recipe -- just didn't taste like the cake!

I first had this at a restaurant.  They dipped the martini glass in graham cracker crumbs, giving it a more caky taste.  This is a great martini.  I don't like martinis with gin, but like the martini glass.  So glad to find out about this.

I used a 1:1 ratio of  juice to vodka.  More like a  martini.  I will try the splash of amaretto next time.  Very good and easy.  It was a hit as a shot at my New Year's Eve Party.

This is absolutely delicious - - with one minor change.  I added amaretto to the vanilla vodka and pineapple juice.  The amaretto gives it a "graham cracker crust" taste, or the cake-like flavor in pineapple upside down cake.  The girls all love this cocktail.  Some guys too!!!  Thanks for the excellent recipe, Boilermish!

This was delish! We used the amaretto and loved the flavor. For presentation purposes, we would recommend adding the cherry to the bottom of the glass w/ a little grendaine. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but sweet. I think next time I might add a splash of cranberry juice like someone else had suggested.  Be careful with these because sweet drinks go down too easy. It does taste like a pineapple upside down cake.  Will try again. Others liked it as well. Thanks for sharing.

This is delicious!  We'd bump up the vanilla just a touch next time, I think it would completely hide any taste of alcohol...  It's  dangerous! :D  ...On accident, we omitted the vodka and subbed cranberry juice, if you want a nearly alcohol-free drink, it's delicious!

Yummy!  Inspired by my mini pineapple upside-down cakes, I had to try these.  I usually invent martinis on "the fly," so I just used this recipe as a guide.  I mixed up 2 drinks in my shaker by combining 3 shots of pineapple juice, 2 shots vanilla vodka, and 1/2 shot amaretto.  I used the amaretto instead of the grenadine.  I also ran out of vanilla vodka (I was about 1 1/2 shots short), so I used plain vodka and about 1/4 tsp. Mexican vanilla extract.  Wow!  Tastes exactly like the cake!  I put 2 cherries in the bottom of the martini glass and some pineapple on the rim.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for the idea!

WAS THE BEST MARTINI WE SERVED at our annual holiday martini party this year. HUGE HIT! Tasted fabulous, I did the amaretto version.
2/3 cup pineapple juice
1/3 cup vanilla flavored vodka (Stoli's)
dash of grenadine
1/4 cup or so of amaretto
an orange for garnish and we were set.
Tasted so  delicious..we ran out and started using pineapple/orange juice mix

everyone loved it. And we had some good ones this year. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

These were way too sweet!  I made them exactly as the recipe calls for.  I might try them again but I'll use regular vodka instead of vanilla vodka.

Holy Cow ! this was the best "girly" drink recipe. I made 2 huge pitcher's of it (upping the scale of the recipe meter ) for my bunco party ... everyone went wild over it.

Thank you .. it will be my signature drink next year too !

I LOVE THIS DRINK!!  I look forward to having this drink when I get home on Fridays after a long week at work!  I normally use equal parts pineapple juice and vodka so it has much more of a kick.  If you don't have vanilla vodka, I have had great success with plane vodka and a tsp. or so of torani sugar-free vanilla syrup.  But do include vanilla in some form - it really adds the "cake" portion of the drink's name.  I have also used orange and lemon vodka (when I ran out of plain/vanilla and needed my martini fix!).  Highly recommend.  Thanks for the post!

These are real popular at the bars around here and most places serve them as a shot with these same ingredients but different ratios...1 part vanilla vodka, 1 part pineapple, and a small drop of grenadine.  I give the original recipe 4 stars because as a drink, it pretty much just tastes like pineapple juice to me and the real key is to add in some amaretto to get the real taste of a pineapple upside down cake as a drink.  You can also add in some vanilla liqueur to give it more of a vanilla taste alone or with the amaretto added.  Either way its great!  Great girly drink with a nice sweet flavor!

Delicious! I served these at my friends New Years party and even the guys were asking for them! I used a tad less vodka than the recipe called for and it was perfect! Will totally make again. Thanks!

I had a party and made up 2 gallons of this stuff the day before to be refrigerated. Right before the party I put it in a beverage fountain and used it as more of a punch --  This was a super simple and delicious recipe. I will be having it again when I want to impress my guest.
