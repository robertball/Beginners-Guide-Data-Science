WOW - this is definitely a HOME RUN!!!  I shared the recipe with my family who are also full-blooded Italians and we absolutely loved it!  Thank you for sharing such a GREAT recipe, Melanie.

Flavorful, easy. I found it to be a bit soggy so next time I will add the tomatoes in during the last 5 minutes. This was great over pasta
