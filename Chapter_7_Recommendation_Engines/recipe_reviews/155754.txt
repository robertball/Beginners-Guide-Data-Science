The dried beef is made by Hormel and is sold in a small clear glass jar. Ask for help finding it. It's an old product that's been around for a long time.

This is a good, basic savory cheese ball.  I mixed everything together in a food processor and it was super-easy.  Just make sure the folks you will be serving it to like green olives.

This was so delicious! Everyone absolutely loved it and it was gone in no time. It tasted great on its own but I have also tried adding extra sharp cheddar cheese for some extra flavour and this was just as delicious. It gave it some extra flavour, making the taste of the cream cheese a little fainter (although, don't get me wrong, I love cream cheese). All in all, I loved this recipe (as is)!!! Will be making MANY times again. It's now a favourite for parties.

I make this every year but add 6 oz blue cheese, and add a couple of dashes of garlic powder and onion powder, diced fine green and red pepper and also diced black olives and a cap full of lemon juice. Easy on the olives as they can be over powering. I do not use nuts - just put it in a bowl and serve with several kinds of crackers. It is always the first appetizer to be gone. Chilling overnight is best.

I made this for two Christmas parties this year (2011) and it was a huge hit!  I don't eat meat so I substituted smoked salmon instead.  Amazing!

I couldn't find the smoked beef at the grocery store, which gave me the idea to use summer sausage from my husband's deer.  I chopped it in the blender, and it processed to perfection.  I also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I didn't get a chance to try to original recipe, but my what I did have was great.  Thanks for sharing.

I used two packages of Budig Pastrami and left out the green olives.  The olives can be just too salty.  I serve it with pretzels (which I know adds back salt).  The Worcestershire sauce really pulls all the flavors together.

The green olive is very prominent in this.  A little bit goes a long way.  The cheese mixture was very soft, I could not roll it so I just put it in a bowl and used a knife to put on the Ritz crackers.

This is the cheese ball my mother used to make every year, only without the olives. (They can override and change the flavor of everything.) I was going to add "but my mom used worcestershire sauce in hers" when I re-read this and saw it was in there!  Just add a little more of the sauce, a little bit of garlic powder (or Mrs. Dash garlic and herb) for a really great cracker spread. Yum!

This was really good, but I left out the beef, cause I didn't know if that meant "beef jerky type?" Still very good though!

For the smoked beef look for Buddig Beef in the lunch meat section of the grocery.  It comes in a bag, not a glass jar.  It is the traditional product for this recipe.

Absolutely awesome!  So delicious!  We followed the recipe regarding the olives, but did add some garlic powder.  It was gone in no time.  Now have to get busy and make more for the holidays (lol).

I love this cheeseball, make it often for parties, etc.  Frequently I will add about 1/2 can of crushed pineapple to it.  The combination of the sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the olives play off each other well.

I found the green olives to make the cheese ball too salty for our taste.  One tip from another reviewer was to add shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese.. this worked out great!  I'm making the cheese ball a second time, omitting the green olives and using diced green onions in its place.  Also, adding a bit more Worcestershire sauce and added a dash of garlic powder.  I think the second time around will be a winner!

Amazing flavour.  My guests all raved about it.  The mixture didn't firm up as suggested by the recipe, but stayed liquid, more like a dip.  Not a problem, as it was snapped up by everyone.  Very easy to make, and very tasty.  Good job Love2Cook87. Thankyou.

For those of you who can't find sliced smoked meat, go to your deli and ask for the smoked meat.  Same meat that is used in a smoked meat sandwich.
I am going to try it with a can of corned beef next time.  I think it should be good.

I was leary of using the whole onion so I only used a quarter and I think that was a perfect amount. The aroma of the cheese ball was great. I did make this for christmas and it was liked by all. It was easy to make with easy to find ingridents.

This is very good and easy to put together.  The only thing I changed was I used chopped green onions instead of the sweet onions and added a tub of blue cheese crumbles.  I also used 2 pkgs of cream cheese instead of the 1 1/2 pkg.    Delicous!

My mom made this for the holidays all the time growing up and today I'm making it for New Year's Eve. She didn't use walnuts and layered sliced green olives all around it -- but I am chopping up the olives and rolling it in walnuts which is easier, just as pretty and adds a nice crunch :) She served it with Ritz crackers and Chicken in a Biscuit crackers so I'll probably do the same, maybe a whole grain cracker also. It's definitely delicious and presents well on a nice cheese platter or plate.

I made this for my family last year at Christmas time.  The first comment out of my daughter's mouth was, "make this again next year". There wasn't a bit of leftovers.  Delicious and easy to make.

We liked it, but I like my mother-in-law's version better. It's similar, but has more beef, all green onions, and more Worcestershire.

Tried it - just as written (as I usually do).  Not good at all - It was just cream cheese.  I'm glad I tried it before wasting the nuts on it.  I guess I should have thought about it before mixing it up - just cream cheese in a cheese ball?

I made this without the green olives (though I did use pimiento on its own), and it was fabulous! Unless you and your guests REALLY like green olives, I would leave them out. They are a very over-riding flavor and only those who love them will enjoy them in this recipe. Great recipe that is easily tweaked to make it "your own"!

It takes all my willpower not to dive head first into this cheese ball. I have visions of eating it with both hands,  throw the  crackers to the wind.

It turned out great. I used black olives cuz my family prefers them over green. Also used sharp cheddar cheese.

I made this recipe because it was similar to a cheese ball my mom always made growing up. I used two philadelphia cream cheese instead of the 1 1/2 the recipe called for. I used a food processor to chop everything up and then used it to blend everything together. My cheese ball came out very loose; wouldn't even mold into a ball after it sat in the refrigerator all night. So, don't use the processor on the cream cheese! I saw another person used green onions which I think I may try to use next.

Totally loved this one!  It  was a huge hit with my family on Christmas Eve.  I thought about experimenting with crushed pineapple with it (leaving out the olives).

I made it as directed... and then, thanks to Denis, it became tolerable... and then I added MORE Worcestershire... and then some liquid smoke... (rolling my eyes...)  What I ended up with was NOT this recipe, and again, thanks to Denis, it can be rated a tolerable two star.  If my hostess throws this into the lake my feelings won't be hurt.

This was really tasty. However, it was too soft for me to make a cheese ball out of it... in fact, my family jokingly called it a 'cheese flat'! I ended up skipping the nuts and served it as a dip instead. I will definitely will make it again as a dip.

Love the way the olives,beef and walnuts all work together with the cream cheese. My mom use to make this for Christmas when I was a kid, in the 70's. Memories!
