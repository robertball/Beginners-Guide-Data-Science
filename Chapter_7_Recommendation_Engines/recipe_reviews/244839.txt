Just made these to taste test.  It was super simple and they were pretty good!  We used frozen peaches and the margaritas turned out a little boozy.  So we added about 1oz triple sec, and 1/4 cup sugar.  Yum!  Our next batch we'll replace sugar with more agave nectar instead.

I didn't  have a lime on hand, so I used some margarita mix instead. This was very good!!! Definitely will make this again!
