This recipe got many compliments at our dinner party. I toasted the almonds, used green onion instead of red, and used craisins instead of raisins. So, it was basically the same. Very good, thanks for the recipe.

I made this salad for dinner this evening and served it along-side a big slice of quiche - it was just fantastic!!  I modified the recipe only slightly by toasting the almonds (for added flavour) and I omitted the raisins as DH doesn't like them very much.  This salad is a winner for sure!!

Made this sald up for a fancy 4 course meal.  Did the apples up ahead of time and they were too mushy to serve!  Went ahead without them and it was awesome!  Made it the next day for dinner with the leftover ingredients!

Everything about this recipe was perfect.  I used Kraft Light Raspberry Vinaigrette, and it turned out really good.

Good -  just nothing too special, but a nice change from time to time.  I used green instead of red onions and walnuts instead of almonds ... next time I'd stick with almonds.

It was excellent.  I used a little less feta because I don't like a whole lot of feta, but I liked the different textures and flavours.

This is a wonderful salad! I use blue cheese in lieu of feta and I often add bacon. If I don't have almonds, I caramelize walnuts.

This salad was bomb-diggety. If you're trying to impress guests, definitely serve this salad! My parents raved about it! I left out the raisins and used the raspberry vinaigrette dressing from the allrecipes website and it went together perfectly.

Hubby doesn't like raisins, so I used seedless red grapes.  The salad was outstanding, but in my family it only served 3 (big portions), not 6.  If we have company we'll have to double the recipe!

This is a great quick salad.  The feta cheese balanced the tart applesa and sweet raisins, and the almonds add a really nice crunch.  A really good combination, and so quick with bottled dressing.  I will definitely make this again.

Delightful blend of flavors!  Instead of mixing the whole recipe in a serving bowl, I layered the ingredients on individual salad plates.  Very easy and no soggy leftovers.  Also added a few fresh raspberries.

This salad was a huge hit.  I carmalized some nuts for the salad.  A few tried the salad before the dressing came around and they enjoyed it plain too.

This is AWESOME. I grilled some chicken breasts (with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and added one to each salad to make this a real entree. Amazing!

Great salad!  Added extra raisins for taste and some sunflower seeds.  Even my mom, who is very picky, said she'd take it for lunch the next day.  Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!!!

Delicious salad!  I used Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing from this site for the dressing, and it was a great accompaniment!  I used Craisins rather than the raisins (preferences of guests I was serving), but either one works great for us!  Thank you so much for this recipe, SKETTYMAKER!

Good, except next time I'll add more raisins, almonds, & apple. It is such a nice change from regular greens, carrot, mushroom & tomato salad.

I had already made my own version when I found this recipe, so mine is a little different. I used spinach and romaine as my lettuce mix. I added craisins, chopped apple, mint, slivered almonds, feta, lite raspberry vinaigrette, and ground flax and tossed together. I really like the addition of the flax for a nutty flavor and extra fiber. Next time I will try adding the onion. Yummy and very healthy.

I made this for a party the other night and I think I loved it more than they did!  I was a little weary about the rasp vinagrette because I wasn't feeling the flavors meshing but it was delicious.  Some tried it with a balsamic vinagrette too! How do you keep all the yummy stuff from going to the bottom? Oh, and I toasted the almonds!

This is a great salad to put together at the last minute.  If you have raspberry vinaigrette on hand, it takes no time at all.  All you need to do is chop the apple.  On top of that, it is a salad that is a little bit different from the usual fare.  Everyone loved it, so I'll be making this one again!

Love this salad.  I used a bag of Dole Seven Lettuce blend, a Granny Smith apple, and Girard's Light Raspberry Vinaigrette.  I made it just as the recipe states and thought it was sweet and delicious.  While I think you could change some of the ingredients to match what you have on hand (ex: exchange Craisins for golden raisins) it is absolutely not necessary to achieve a great salad.  I will definitely be making this again.

I loved this salad.  I am rating it 5 stars because it is just amazing.  I didn't have all the right ingredients though, so I had to substitute.  Sub white onion for red, sub vine ripe tomatoes for raisins.  I am sure it would have been even better with the original ingredients.  I also needed to knock my bottled raspberry vinaigrette up a notch so I added 1/2 T dijon mustard, 1 t yellow curry, and 2 t brown sugar to 1 c bottled dressing.  Delicious! Slicing your apples julienne style makes a pretty addition as well. Texture with everything, especially the almonds can't be beat.  I will make this again for sure and i next time I'll have the raisins!

This was absolutely awesome. Flavors mix very well. If you are a fan of Panera Bread salads, try this one!

Really great salad!  I do not like to make salads, so I was very happy when this turned out to be so tasty.  All the components of the salad work perfectly with one another.  A must try :)

This salad was beautiful!  I went ahead and tossed the vinaigrette with the salad instead of with each individual serving.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to toss thye dressing in RIGHT before serving - I did a while before serving and then refrigerated it, and the greens were not quite crisp.  Other than that - wonderful!

This was ok.  I love salads with apples, but I thought the dressing made it too sweet.  I also only used 5 oz of salad greens because that's all that would fit in the bowl.

Fast, easy and very versatile. Add some spinach, change up the raisins for cranberries, add some mandarins, seeds, anything you want!  The raspberry vinaigrette is yum, but I like to change that out for the maple balsamic vinaigrette on this website in cooler  weather.  Leftover chicken or steak sliced into it makes a great dinner.
