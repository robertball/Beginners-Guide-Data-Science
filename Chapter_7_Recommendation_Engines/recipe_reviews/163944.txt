Very easy and delicious. Great with a simple salad (I used goat cheese and toasted almonds).

Depending on cranberry juice used watch your sugar lvls, I could of easily cut the sugar in half.  I also blitzed the Vinaigrette  to make a smoother texture and to emulsify it better. Smoothie setting on the blender  works well.

I loved it- of course, I did change some things. I used cranberry-pomegranate juice because it was what I had on hand. I eliminated the salt, used green onions from the garden instead of shallots. I also cut the sugar down to 2 tsps. I used slivered almonds which I ground just by chopping it up with a knife.  I had no parsley, pepper flakes so I didn't add those.  Also, I thought adding garlic might be odd- so I didn't add that, either. I used this on a very colorful salad: fresh spring greens, blueberries, strawberries, orange tomato, fresh broccoli crowns, sprinkled with sunflower seeds. I didn't use the garlic because the intended salad was fruit-heavy. Overall, it was great!

I had a spicy cranberry vinaigrette at a wedding I attended and loved it. This was the closest recipe I could find. The first time I made it, it was so salty... I didn't like the flavor at all. After trial and error, I have  come to eliminate the salt entirely and add about 3 tablespoons of sugar instead. It is amazing... seriously amazing dressing... like "lick your plate clean, cat fight over the last of it" dressing.

I really expected more flavor. This vinaigrette has no vinegar. I think it needs a bit to give it some tang. I cut the salt to 1 tsp, but still thought the end result was too salty. I can't say that I'll make this one again. It was a nice idea, but needs some real tweaking to be really good.

It sounded good but just wasn't what I expected.

So good! I made this to go over feta-stuffed chicken on a bed of fresh spinach. It was delicious.
