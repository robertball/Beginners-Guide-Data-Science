This is so good!  I've made it twice now with haddock.  Came out perfect both times.  It's a keeper.

My husband loved it!  I added some shredded parmesan cheese and it was great.

It was moist and crunchy and soooo good!  I am going to make it again for sure.  I added just a little bit more cayenne pepper for a bit more bite.

Thumbs up from everyone here.  I had to use chicken breast strips for this recipe due to allergies, but the corn flake crust, seasoning and mayo worked very well. My picky kids ate it up and even fought over the last piece.  Will definitely make this again.  This doesn't taste like mayo nor like corn flakes.  It has an easy crunchy coating that doesn't fall off.  Crispy and crunchy.  A very nice change from the usual corn flour or bread crumb coating as well as being made in the oven cuts out any frying.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was moist and flavorful. I used mahi mahi and dried dill (1/2 the amount called for) because that's what I had but otherwise used the ingredients as listed. I added the seasonings to the mayo thinking they would be more evenly distributed on the fish than if I mixed into the cornflakes. Thanks for a great recipe, I will be making this again!

My wife and I agreed that it was just remarkably unremarkable. It didn't taste bad or anything, it just didn't stand out in any way whatsoever. Made it after seeing it in the magazine.

I used butter instead of mayonnaise and it was delicious. I also used orange roughy because that is what I had. I will definitely try this again.

It turned out good, my husband was surprised when I brought out the corn flake crumbs but he did enjoy it. I didn't have dill but it still turned out good.

Used paprika, mustard powder, and red chili powder instead of dill and cayenne pepper. Also used catfish instead of halibut. Cooked this a little longer than 12 minutes just to be sure, about 20 minutes because it still seemed "gooey".
