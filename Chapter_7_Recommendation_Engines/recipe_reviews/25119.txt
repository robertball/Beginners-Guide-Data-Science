This is a great recipe.  The dough is very soft and I was afraid they would spread all over, but they didn't. The cookie part is almost cake like. I dropped them by tablespoonsful and baked them on a baking stone for about 14 min. They came out soft and stayed soft. Experiment with the amount of peanut butter and chips to find your "just right" taste. An excellent recipe.

Light, but crispy.  My son and his friend really loved them this afternoon.  Don't be scared of the orange juice (as I was) - you can't tell!  Thanks for a good basic recipe!

These were delicious. I ended up baking them for 20 minutes - don't know if it's because I live at such high altitude but they weren't cooked through at 14 minutes, nor at 16, so 20 was perfect. I only had white sugar so used that, but otherwise followed the recipe to the T and it was wonderful!

This is the first "by scratch" cookie recipe that I got that got a hearty thumbs up from my husband. I don't think he believes they are from scratch! I store them in a plastic container, and they stay soft as long as they're in there (3 days max. in this household). I didn't find that they were too cakey at all.

This was exactly the taste I was looking for combining Peanut Butter and Chocolate chips.  And the cookie texture is excellent.  Now, here's my take on the orange juice.  I didn't have any on hand, so I used apple juice.  But the real trick with the juice is this.  Add it one tablespoon at a time as you add each quarter of the flour mixture.  It keeps the flour dusting to a minimum.

These turned out great. I was a tad afraid of the orange juice, but if did no harm at all; if anything made them better! I will definately make these again and again.

Unfortunately, the cookies did not turn out "moist and chewy" as claimed, but were dry and cakey.

This recipe was GREAT!  I was skeptical about the orange juice until I read other reviews (still don't understand the purpose of the oj though).  Anyway, these cookies turned out perfect and the taste was excellent!

I think these are very good. . I used the fun chip mix instead of chocolate chips.Not sure what the orange juice is for but it doesn't hurt it.

A very tasty and moist cookie. My old school old country father that has never had peanut butter loves them. The recipe is easy to follow. The only thing I changed is I used salted butter, and left out the salt. Worked GREAT!!!

These cookies are so good. This was a great recipe. The cookies stayed firm and never spread out. Probably the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies out there.  They are easy to make and don't take any time at all. The orange juice must be for added flavor, I am not sure. I did leave them in for 18 minutes though.

Other reviewers are right; this recipe doesn't make 60 cookies, and I used my smallest cookie scoop.  At any rate, these aren't bad, they don't spread too much (with the consistency of the dough I was afraid that they would), and it's a nice flavor combo.  However, I think I would prefer less chocolate chips and more peanut butter, so I think I'll stick with pb cookies next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I halved the recipe and only got 18 smallish cookies, so I think the serving size must be a bit off. Anywho, very tasty. My fiance requested the chocolate chip/peanut butter cookies and he says these are fantastic. Thanks :)

Great recipe. Hands down, the best cookies I've ever made! Didn't come out flat like other cookies, and I could not taste the OJ in the finished product. The only adjustment I made was adding a little cinnamon.. I live at a high elevation (about 7000 ft) and I did not have any issues with cooking time. In fact, I probably could have pulled them out at 13 minutes and they would've been even better!

Not bad, a little dry but tasty. The family ate most of them in one sitting. I found 11 minutes to be enough baking time.

Great recipe!  I followed the suggestion on making it 1 cup of peanut butter and adding my own twist on it.

I added 3/4 Cup nutella and altered the chocolate chips to be 1 1/4 cup of chocolate and peanut butter chip mix.

I had enough dough left for 4 more cookies so we experimented by adding sea salt on top before baking and I wish I did this to all of them.  So good!

This is my go to cookie recipe! They always turn out so light, soft and round. The peanut butter adds a richness to the cookie without being over powering. On this particular occasion I halved the recipe. Also, I realized I was out of brown sugar and had to sub a sugar/molasses mixture making them darker than usual. I also never have orange juice and typically sub with apple cider vinegar.

Followed recipe to a Tee. Only issue I have is that the center gets very spongy texted which I know some people like but to me it made these cookies dry. Overall the taste is great though!

Great recipe that's a hit at home and work. I zest an orange into the batter before juicing it to add a little extra texture and zing! Going to make two batches now, one to eat and one to freeze for when my family visits in a week or so.

They turned out well.  I think I would recommend a bit more peanut butter.  They certainly had a hint of peanut butter, but not enough to live up to the name!

Looking forward to the next attempt!

I took this to work and to my wine group.  Everyone loved them. They have just the right mixture of everything.

These turned out great! I substituted the OJ with a splash of whole milk. I heavily greased my cookie sheets, and kind of pressed and shaped the cookies into biscuit shapes. They came out moist and chewy.

The amount of time 14 minutes was way too long, I left them in for 10 minutes and they still burned. Wouldn't do this recipe again.

I give this recipe 3 stars because I used it and the cookies are dry and cake textured, also if I had left them in for the 14 minutes it says they would be burnt hockey pucks. Not sure if I will use this recipe again.

These were cakey not moist and chewy, not overly tasty, found them too sweet and they burned to a crisp when we left them in for the 14 minutes.

A really tasty cookie recipe. Took the advice of some of the other reviewers and increased the amount of peanut butter to one cup rather than 3/4 cup and I'm really glad I did. May even increase to 1 1/4 cup next time but they turned out really well with the one cup. Baked them for 13 minutes at 350 as my first batch came out a little too crispy after 14 min. Definitely does not make 60 cookies though. I got 30 cookies from this recipe and would have been hard pressed to get any more. Will definitely make this one again.

This recipe was just as described. I was surprised that I needed to bake them for 14 minutes, as I usually underbake to keep the cookies soft. They are great for the first two days but don't taste quite as fresh after that. I am definitely keeping this recipe in my rotation!

Mmmmmmmmmmm....yummy!  Light and crispy, delicious peanut butter flavor..so good!  I used mini chocolate chips and threw in some Heath pieces that I had left over (about 1/3 cup).  SOOOOO GOOD!  Btw, you can't even taste the orange juice.  thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe was amazing!! The cookies came out very light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Like most other people, I was afraid of the orange juice and even accidentally put an extra tablespoon or so in, but they still turned out great! The orange juice seemed to really bring out the peanut buttery flavor that can sometimes be lost in a recipe.. Five stars, definitely a great treat!

Absolutely phenomenal! It's a great, somewhat healthy way to statisfy a peanut butter and chocolate craving. And surprisingly moist for a peanut butter cookie, which I'm guessing the credit goes to the orange juice. These cookies barely stayed on the plate in my office and were devoured by my family. These are a definte to make again!

These cookies are amazingly soft and chewy.  I use Reeces Pieces instead of choc chips though - a better complement in my opinion. 
As for the orange juice, I think it's there to make the dough/batter taste funny so kids won't eat it.  Once the cookies have baked and cooled that OJ flavor is gone!

Good inclusion of peanut butter with a [for the most part] basic chocolate chip cookie recipe.  Taste notwithstanding, the recipe produced a cookie with a gritty and dry texture.
