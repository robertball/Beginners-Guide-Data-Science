I liked the simplicity of this recipe, but after reading the reviews I decided to make a few changes. I changed the butter to a pat of butter, the rest olive oil, I used nine very large, ripe, meaty red peppers, roasted and peeled the peppers (and added one chipotle pepper). I used 24 oz of chicken and 16 oz. veg broth (Kitchen Basics brand) and added salt. Didn't sieve. Great results but I should have added another onion. Also, next time I think I would try adding a large pureed potato instead of the cream. The cream changed the color of the soup from a gorgeous red to a less-than-gorgeous orange. Tip: cook the vegetables, puree them, them put the puree in a kettle and add the broth--why puree hot broth?

This recipe is much easier if you puree the soup using an immersion blender right in the soup pot, before adding the cream.  Also, you can use chopped, frozen onions to save time.  Lastly,  for a nice flavor, roast the peppers ahead of time in a foil pan or foil-lined roasting pan in a 450 degree oven, turning once or twice until brown and puffy on all sides.  Cool, peel, remove stems, and as many seeds as you can.  Add to sauteed onions and garlic and proceed with the recipe.  Cayenne pepper is great in this, as suggested by others.  THANK YOU!

Just when I think that I can master easy recipes such as this, something happens that reminds me that I can be such a klutz in the kitchen! When it came time to "puree" the broth/peppers, I poured it into my handy dandy blender that has never failed me when making my morning smoothies and other tasty treats, and like a smart person should, I put my hand over the lid and turned it on and....WHOOSH!!! Almost half the batch exploded all over the kitchen (Keep in mind...this stuff is hot from the stovetop!)!!  It was on the walls, all over the countertop and I looked like a red pepper threw up on me! You should have seen the eyes on my family! After ensuring noone was hurt, (cuz that stuff was HOT!!) we all had a great laugh. What WAS left (about two bowls worth) was very good. In fact, the soup was VERY good. It has a tomato soup substance but with a refined and elegant taste. However, next time, I'll find my "safer" hand mixer...as this soup WILL be repeated and I'll leave my blender in the cupboard! Thank you for the recipe submission Judi...and the laugh! :)

This is the best Red Pepper Soup recipe I have ever made and my family loves it. I roasted the peppers first, and then removed the skin. I also added some seasoning salt and because I live with a vegetarian I used a vegetarian "chicken stock". I made it once with a vegetable vegetarian stock but found that the flavor wasn't as rich. For special occasions I usually plate this "restaurant style" using a technique that a chef showed me. I add a small dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche to the middle of each soup bowl. Then I add a drop of balsamic vinegar to the middle of the sour cream and put a small peice of micro green (baby salad piece) beside it. It makes it look super fancy and doesn't alter the taste. Thanks Judi for this amazing recipe

Great soup! My husband and I loved it! Some of the things I did differently from the original recipe were:

1. Broiled the red peppers
2. Added Thyme
3. Used chicken bullion cubes instead of cans of chicken broth (bullion cubes tastes a lot better)
4. Added sea salt

Excellent soup!  Note - don't put boiling hot soup in a blender with a plastic lid.  It will explode.  Ouch.  Regardless, the soup was phenomenal and we added a dollop of sour cream and some cilantro upon serving.  I also added cayenne pepper and a dash of thyme.  I plan on making it again tomorrow!

This was so perfect for stormy fall nights that I made it two days in a row. The second time I roasted the peppers on the grill and removed the skins to improve the soup's texture. The flavors were great roasted or unroasted. A wonderful soup!

Excellent, superb, fantastic, wonderful.  And I don't even LIKE bell peppers!  I had a bunch to use up from a friend, and went looking for a soup recipe.  This one looked easy and the reviews were good.  I doubled it (I had that many peppers), and added the cayenne suggested by other reviewers.  Now, I'm a changed woman - red bell peppers are GOOD when they're like this!

It was more work than I imagined, with the chopping, sauteeing, simmering, pureeing (with my stick blender), and straining, but man was it worth it.  I'm making this one again, and next time I'm making sure company is here to enjoy it - I look like a gourmet chef!

Mine turned out a little thin, so I cooked and added a butternut squash. It was so good, I didn't even need to add the cream. An excellent simple recipe perfect for bread dunking!

Absolutely awesome!  And so easy!  I added a dash of cayenne pepper (not enough to make it hot, just enough to flavor it slightly) and a dollup of sour cream in the middle.  It was great.

This is delicious with the proper adjustments.  First I roasted the red peppers which is so easily done by cutting the tops off the peppers, getting rid of the seeds, and cutting them vertically in half.  Then place them skin side up on a baking sheet lined with foil.  Place your oven rack closest to the heat you can, and broil at 450, for about 15-20 mins, until the skins are black and welting.  Then take them out and place them in a gallon ziploc bag, seal, and cover them with a kitchen towel.  This allows them to "sweat" for about 5-10 mins.  The skins will come right off then.  I sauted the onions and garlic in the pan for the amount of time listed in butter.  Then placed my roasted red peppers, onion/garlic mix in the blender until pureed.  Put it back in the pot, and then added the chicken stock.  I was contemplating about the straining part.  I went to strain it, and decided immediately to not continue!  To be honest the broth alone looks gross, it would just be orange colored chicken broth, and it leaves all the pulp (which is full nutrients, and healthiest part) behind.  I dumped it all back together put it back on the burner, and added black pepper, and Cayenne.  Please note that cayenne is a spice that the more time it heats up (tempature wise) the more th flavor comes out.  So please allow it to simmer for a few minutes before truly taste testing.  I also added a dash of chili powder to give it extra oomph!  Dished it up, put a spoonful of sour cream in a baggie,

This soup was FABULOUS!!  I loved it and will definitely make it over and over again.  I took the advice of my fellow cooks and stirred in some cayenne.  Yum!  Instead of using a blender I stuck my hand blender into the pot and went to town.  This soup was great hot or cold.  I can't wait to make it again!

This is a good soup base. I cooked little mini ground beef balls to add to this, because I have a meat loving husband. I decided to use ground beef because of the stuffed peppers concept. I only used salt and pepper in them before browning. I added  a pinch of cumin and paprika to taste. Careful with the cumin will take over the flavor before you know it. Next time I will add some cooked potato chunks. Definitely will roast and take the skins off the peppers before making this soup again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the extremely fussy Mr P absolutely loved it and has already requested it again at the weekend. However, I did make a fair few changes; used olive oil not butter, upped the garlic, added chopped chorizo, added red pepper flakes & added a jar of roasted red peppers (simply didn't have time to roast fresh ones myself). Oh, and I didn't strain the puree - no need that I could see. End result was utterly yummy - whole pot got finished between 2 people (and I only had half a bowl...). Thanks very much for the recipe.

Overall, a very tasty bowl of soup.  I made a couple of changes, principally to improve the healthy aspects of the soup.  I used light butter instead of regular butter, and instead of using the cream, I used half as much half n half and an equal amount of lowfat milk.  When tasting, I realized that the soup was rather sweet to taste, so much so that I added salt and pepper, as well as a dash of cayenne to balance out the sweetness.  Very good and very healthy with my minor changes!

Delicious! I roasted the peppers in the oven and peeled them. This soup recipe really should be doubled to make enough for 4 people. The servings were quite small, so I roasted 3 very large red bell peppers and it still was not enough. Next time I will double. I also used Lawry´s Garlic Salt instead of regular salt. I suggest topping with a little sour cream and chopped up shallots on top. It tastes like you are at a gourmet french restaurant. Yum!

This is a great recipe -- quick, easy, limited number of ingredients and not bad for you either!  I used half and half instead of cream and skipped the unnecessary strainer step, putting it in the blender solely.  I garnished with sour cream and bright red pimentos.  Also had some left-over bisquits and the soup was excellent over them.  Definitely try this recipe.

I hate straining, so I roast my red peppers, skin them, then puree 'til smooth.    To roast: rub oil on peppers, put under broiler until blackened on all sides (for me, roughly 8 min per side).  Put in a sealed tupperware container for 15 min, peel skin & core.  Cut into strips for pureeing.

Fantastic - just 1 tip and 1 suggestion:  roast red peppers whole on a foil wrapped pan for 40 min at 450 degrees - till skin is blackened, then, put them in thick ziplock bags for 15 min or so and the skin will fall right off.  I did not need to strain the soup by removing the skin and it added a lot of flavor and thickness

This is a great gormet-like soup.  Although instead of straining the soup I put it in my food processor and blend it well.  I also added a touch of cayenne pepper.

This is my kids long time favorite soup. I made a few adjustments. I grill the whole peppers and onion first. I peel the blackened skin off the peppers, but I first puncture the grilled pepper to drain the fluids that build up inside to use in the soup.

I changed this recipe...a lot!... but the end result was great.  I started by roasted 6 red peppers instead of 4.  Roasting makes the falvours come out and its very quick and easy.  I then followed the first steos of the recipes and used a sweet onion. after adding the borth and pureed red pepper I took a taste test and decided not to add any milk or cream and added the salt, pepper and thyme...the thyme is what made the soup amazing!!.  I simmered for a very long time and then strained it one more time, this time through a cheesecloth, making sure everything was completely smooth.  The little chunks that were caught were blended one more time and added back in.  It took a little more time but it made the soup all that much better.  Time and Thyme made this recipe a new favourite for me!  Thanks for the base!

*EDIT: I remade this again today and this time pureed the peppers, onion and garlic after they cooked.  This eliminated having to puree/strain again...a big time saver!

this was awesome.  I followed others with roasting the peppers.  I also, used my food processor and magic bullet to blend the items together.  I didn't have a hand held one.  I will be making this again.  Thanks again for sharing.

Followed other reviewers suggestion to roast the peppers before hand.  What a flavorful soup with so little ingredients!  I substituted half and half for cream....honestly it didn't even need that much.

This was delicious.  A friend gave me several red bell peppers and I came in here to see what I could do with them.  I used homemade chicken broth, so I ended up adding 1 t. of sea salt.  And I also chose not to strain this so I could keep the vitamins in the pepper skins.  Thank you for an easy and delicious post.

This soup was wonderful. I thought with no spices that it might be bland but it wasn't...it was full of good flavor. It's just a shame how much red peppers cost! Thanks for the recipe!

Great, but mild pepper flavor.  Followed other suggestions and roasted the bell peppers under the broiler first, and then followed the recipe.  Also used an immersion blender instead of putting soup into a blender, and after putting through the chinoise had a very silky, smooth soup.  Solid recipe, thanks for sharing!

So So Delicious - and low-carb/low-cal.  We made a double batch and took this in our lunches for a few days.  Made the recipe as stated, but sprinkled some cayenne in my portion to add a little kick.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Judi!

This was a very good soup that my husband and I both enjoyed. (My 9-year-old didn't like it. She doesn't care for chili and no amount of telling her this was NOT chili would convince her. Red soup = chili to her.) I felt like it was missing a little something until I stirred in some sour cream right at the end. Loved the extra tang and will use that instead of cream next time!

Really good. Followed recipe except roasted the peppers instead of sauteing them.  I'm not a big salt fan but needed to add a little due to blandness.  Next time I may increase the garlic instead of added salt.  This was a big hit with my husband and 4 year old.

Very good.  I didn't strain it, I roasted the peppers (would have been just fine unroasted), I added a dash of cayenne and a jalapeño.    Thank you for this awesome summer recipe.  I'm very proud of the results-- it would be delicious cold as well as hot!

Loved This!  We had this for a soup course at Easter and everyone thought it was great.  I first quartered the peppers and roasted them until soft and puffy - not black.  I used an immersion blender and did not strain the soup - unnecessary - it was perfectly smooth.  I also added some cubed cheddar cheese after the cream and it was fabulous!  I thought it was super easy with those changes.

Delicious.  The only things I did differently were to add a teaspoon of salt, and skip the straining.  I used an immersion blender instead of a conventional blender.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made 2 batches of this one with chicken broth and a smaller one with vegetable broth for my vegetarian daughter. Honestly there was no noticeable difference. Both tasted great. Will make again soon. Thanks

Wow This soup is too delicious.  I used a lesser salt variety of broth and it was delicious.  I tried it pre-strained and found it must be strained for maximum enjoyment.  Tasted even better the next day.

pleasant tasting but lacking some oomph. if I make again I'll experiment with additions to kick it up. make sure to strain, I tried to skip this step but it really needs it!

Great soup! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I actually made quite a few changes, which in my opinion, made it much better!
1. I roasted the peppers in the oven first- simply placed them whole on a tray at abut 400 degrees, flipping them over once. They're ready once they become a bit black and the skin starts to peel.
2. I used half the butter and olive oil for the other half- I sautéed grated carrot and celery along with the onion and garlic, then added the roasted peppers before adding the broth
3. After simmering, I blended it together right in the pot, no need to transfer or strain
5. Then add the cream (I used light cream, but more than the recipe indicates) and I also added some parmesan cheese
6. I added salt, pepper, thyme, oregano and a small amount of cayenne then let it simmer a bit longer so all the flavours can blend together 
It was a success!

I have to admit, I'm new enough to have never heard of red pepper soups, but indeed, the recipe is simple and easy to execute, and completely delicious.  The only addition I made were a few chunks of ham, mostly for sweetness and substance.  It came out amazingly well.

Outstanding soup, hot or cold. I always roast the peppers and add the skins to the blender for that smokey taste. 

When I serve it cold, I added a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt in the center of the bowl and then arrange thin strips of cucumber and sweet yellow peppers and diced celery to form a little 'nest', giving it eye appeal and a little crunch. 

I would omit those toppings when serving hot.

Also, rather than the heavy cream, oy, I used regular coffee mate for almost no calories and a great creamy texture, and it was still delicious. 

I did use the butter, but every little bit helps.

Thanks, Judi!

I'm trying to stay away from dairy so I used olive oil instead of butter and didn't add the cream. I'm sure that's delicious but the soup was awesome without it. I also didn't strain it just blended a little longer.  Big hit with a family who thinks they don't like peppers, and so easy!

Easy and Delicious! This soup is a snap if you have an immersion/hand-held blender. I blend the peppers/onions/garlic together before adding the chicken stock, and then again after to make it as smooth as possible. Didn't need to strain. Used a red onion, a bit more heavy cream  and added a dash of dill. Served with seasoned croutons. Excellent warm-up soup on a cold winter day! Wished I'd made more though! Really only makes enough for 1 bowl for each of the 5 stated servings.

Good, simple recipe.  My husband and I are trying to shed a few pounds after the holidays, so I used only a pat of butter, and substituted reduced fat buttermilk for the heavy cream (added 3/4 c. instead of just 1/2 c.).  We thought it was delicious!

What a delicious soup!  I made it exactly as the recipe says and I wouldn't change a thing!  :)  But I didn't get 4 servings....it was more like 3.  So next time, I will double it for leftovers!  And try it with cornbread...YUM!

This is a great recipe!  You can also use roasted red peppers in the jar.  I did this using one jar and cut the other ingredients in half.  If you were making a full recipe, I would use at least 2 jars of roasted red peppers.  The flavor was excellent!

Very easy and tasty soup.  Made it as is, with the addition of a few heathly glugs of Frank's Red Hot hot sauce and cooked with some thyme sprigs.  Seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.

I made the recipe exactly as written except for substituting light cream for the heavy cream and using my immersion blender instead of transferring it to a blender (always makes me nervous to blend hot soup!).  I've made it twice over the past few months.  A definite keeper.

This was good, but it wasn't quite red-peppery enough for me. I think this would be more flavorful with roasted peppers and maybe even water instead of broth (I used veg). Even though the broth adds flavor, to me it masked the red pepper. Nice, easy soup, though.

Phenomenal!  I roasted the peppers, skinned them, then added them to the blender with the sautéed onions and garlic.  Add the purée to chicken broth (or chicken bouillon) and then simmer.  Definitely add thyme.  Serve it with sour cream and a splash of balsamic vinegar (really adds to the flavor)!  Went well with asiago bread.

I made this last month with fresh peppers from the local farmer's market!  It was great.  I seared some dry pack sea scallops and served them right a top the soup.  Great meal!  Thanks!

A good basic recipe, but seemed to lack depth of flavor. I did roast the red peppers in the oven as others have suggested; also added some cayenne, freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of allspice and fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream. It definitely needed some salt, which I added. As others have suggested, I pureed the roasted red peppers with the sauteed garlic and onion in the blender and then added chicken stock to the puree in the pot. I think this was much better than trying to puree hot liquids in the blender. I also had an issue with the soup having a rather bitter taste to it.

This is a very nice soup and quite easy to make. I do agree with another review though, there is just a little something missing that would make all the difference, it is so very mild, very smooth

This soup is fantastic...had a ton of frozen peppers from last season and used those.  Doubled it and left out the cream but did add a couple of yukon potatos and added dried red chili pepper.  Used the immerson blender.  Sipping on it right now!!!

I loved this soup. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and fat free half and half instead of cream. I don't have a hand blender so I pureed it in batches in my regular blender with no problem. I also didn't strain it. Very yummy and simple, but not bland. We served it with salad and "Double Tomato Bruschetta" from this site and got rave reviews.

Great soup.  The changes I made are that I use vegetable broth, roast the peppers, add two carrots and two yellow roasted peppers to thicken and sweeten  the soup, and some herbs (basil and/or Italian) and use half and half instead of heavy cream. It's delicious!

This turned out well. I left out the heavy cream and added a yukon gold potato to preserve the beautiful red color of the peppers. I roasted the peppers on the stove over an open flame. And the dash of cayenne is a must!

This was a great dish. I followed others advice and roasted the peppers, and added some cayenne pepper. I thought it still turned out a little sweet for a soup, but the in-laws LOVED it! It has a good taste, looks great, and comes off as a gourmet dish.

My friend and I gobbled up this soup to the last drop. I roasted the peppers first.  I used more garlic cloves.  I added a 1/4 tsp cayenne with the pepper because it needed a bit of zip.  And I used 1% milk (the only kind I keep) instead of the cream.  Whatever soup was left over I used as a sauce over some leftover veggie lasagna - fantastic! A very versatile soup that can double as pasta sauce.

Great starter soups for red peppers...can be used as a base to add to other things. I didn't use the cream and still found it to turn out creamy without it, good for those watching their weight!

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe!  I have made it many times now at home and for other people.  Everyone is surprised at how much they like it.  I follow most of the directions, except I use a jar of marinated peppers and I don't strain the soup after I puree it.  I put it all back in the pan.  I also add red pepper to give it some zing.  A great recipe, especially for low carbers!

I have made this soup from scratch, roasting the pepers and straining the soup.
I have also made it using jars of roasted peppers and skipping the straining process.  I recommend the jar peppers.  Soup can be made in a flash and there is no taste difference and no hard work.  Love this soup..I had some hot sauce at the very end.

Absolutely delightful! I had 2 red peppers that I was trying to find a recipe for and this one seemed perfect (I was VERY doubtful at first). Because I only had 2 peppers, I halved the recipe and it was just enough for my husband and I (served with BBQ'd chicken and garlic french bread). My husband said it was "good but not excellent" (although I think he's still tainted from a butternut squash soup gone bad). Also - VERY IMPORTANT - I substituted evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream because I never buy cream and always have evaporated milk in the cupboard. I think it was a good substitute and probably cut down on some calories/fat. I did not think it was as time consuming as others (but I also didn't simmer for 30 min - I med boiled for about 15). Will definitely make again.

I was hesitant to try this, but it was delicious! Even my friend who does not like peppers liked the mild flavor of this soup. Do this on a day when you want to putter in the kitchen, as it's a bit involved. Next time I do this, I will triple the recipe. The original recipe was enough for two people, and I had seven to feed! I ended up throwing together a southwestern soup and a potato soup to feed the rest of the group. I know that sounds like a lot of soup, but I had the onion and celery on hand, and I used the pulp of the red peppers as the base for the south western soup. Just add chicken broth, a can of black beans, frozen corn and a cup of salsa and you're done!  For the potato soup I sauted onion, garlic and celery.  Added chicken broth, bacon bits and potatoes.  Simmer until tender and add cream, half and half or milk. Yum! We had corn bread along with this soup smorgasbord. What can I say, the fall weather arrived and I'm ready to cook!

After chopping and simmering half of it ended up on the wall. Warning, do not put hot soup in a blender, it will explode everywhere.  A hand mixer is the way to go.  What was left was bland and disappointing.  I love red peppers, but the soup wasn't very good.

Best soup I've ever made, Everytime I have guests over for a dinner party, they request this soup!! For extra zest, I add a touch of cayenne pepper and a table spoon of sour cream in the center and a sprig of parsley for presentation.

my family LOVED this soup and requested I put it in the meal rotation. I roasted and peeled the peppers days before making the soup. I also added a generous dash of cayenne and a pinch of thyme and cumin. Served with feta cheese. Fabulous recipe!

Roast 6+ peppers ahead of time in a 450 degree oven, 20 minutes on each side. Peel the skins off once cooled. Add a little thyme and an extra onion. Serve with feta, a touch of balsamic glaze and a good baguette.

I love this soup. Love it. I roasted the peppers first, let them cool a bit and peel them before adding to the stock.  
2 cans chicken stock next time.

I also have made this with 1 carton of stock,  and let it simmer longer to blend flavours and simmer off some water.

Super tasty! Didn't roast peppers long enough though - they need to be blackened, semi black doesn't get the skin all off!Plus I added too much spice & found it a bit spicy.

Awesome soup.  I didn't bother to strain it.  You CAN put hot soup in blender if you do it in small amounts.  Will definitely make it often.  Wonder if it freezes well.

I always hate giving bad reviews, but this was pretty terrible.  I made the recipe as listed and my boyfriend and I couldn't eat it.  The addition of butternut squash and extra half&half the next day made it somewhat more tolerable.

Fabulous!! The only changes I made were: I used roasted red pepper from a jar (all I had on hand) and I added about 2 cups of chicken broth in addition to what was called for. Easy and a must make! Will be making this again!

Im not a soup person but live this so much. I have made it a few times with this recipe and its just as delicious if you use regular cream that you would but in your coffee and then a tablespoon or cream cheese for every rep pepper you use. Soooo good.

Much like others I roasted the red peppers and added a touch of salt.  I also used Soya Silk instead of the heavy cream to make it a little more calorie friendly.  The consistency might be a bit runnier but the taste is awesome.  Great easy soup to make.

Tasty!  I only had 3 peppers, so I only used about 3/4 onion & tossed in 10-12 grape tomatoes that I needed to use up. I also peeled & diced a potato that I added.  I used vegetable broth, omitted the heavy cream, & added a pinch of thyme.  I like a bit of chunkiness in my soup, so I didn't strain it once I pureed it.  Will definitely make again!

Worth the effort!  I've searched, read reviews and chose this recipe...my family raved over it!  Even my picky kids ate it!  I used 6 roasted peppers and I roasted the garlic.  I added 1/4 tsp tyme, 1/2 tsp basil, 1 tbsp cilantro & 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  This will be a fall comfort food staple in our house!  Time consuming, but well worth the effort!

I roast the red peppers on the BBQ first (whole and blacken the outer layer and then peel the black off). Adds an amazing flavor. I will never make it without first roasting since I think it is much more tasty done that way.

This is an excellent recipe! I am not a fan of bell peppers but a had a bag of baby bells that I had to use up so I made this soup. The only things I did differently was roasting and peeling the skins from the peppers first and olive oil instead of butter. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. This soup was so sweet! I will definately be making it again!

This soup was amazing. However, I changed quite a few things. It is just hubby and me, so I used 3 red bell peppers. I roasted the peppers and the garlic, and carmelized the onion. After this step was completed I seeded the red peppers and put them along with the garlic, onion and one chipolte pepper in the blender. Then, I added my blended items to one can of reduced fat cream of jalepeno soup, and one can of vegetable broth. I let it simmer for about an hour and it was amazing! Left out the heavy cream and butter all together.

I love soups like these were you can really taste a single veggie instead of mixing many. I took the advice from other reviewers and roasted the peppers before cooking them. I also added 2 mashed potatoes and left the cream out as to make it more healthy.

I made this for my family a couple weeks ago and again this week and they absolutely loved it!! My parents are vegetarian so I substituted in vegetable broth but it tasted fantastic. It is very hearty and you never lose the red pepper taste. I actually didn't strain it and thought it gave the soup a nice texture. I also added a little ground cumin and some cilantro and one habenero pepper for a little kick! Great recipe...definitely one of my favorites!

Really delicious soup!!! :) I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I did add a little ceyenne pepper as well! :) I might even try not straining it at all next time, as I don't mind the little bit of chew and added texture to my soups!! Thanks for sharing, will be making this again for sure!

My husband and I both liked this soup.  I agree with other reviewers that the soup needed more flavor beyond the original recipe, so I added 1/4 tsp cayenne.  This definitely added some spice, so next time I might start with 1/8 tsp and then add more to taste.  I also added 1/4 tsp dried basil and used an extra clove of garlic.  I mixed 1/4 cup water and 1/8 cup flour and whisked into soup to thicken it a bit.  Like others, I roasted/boiled the red peppers as suggested, used an immersion blender and did not strain.  Soup is good served with a dense bread or grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was the worst recipe I have made from this website so far. The soup didn't really have any flavor to it. I added carrots, tomato, celery and mushrooms to make it a little tastier.

easy and tastes great. Easy on the stomach too if you have trouble eating peppers.  I used less cream out of preference and still tastes wonderful. I make this soup all the time.

This soup is AWESOME...but instead of using regular chicken broth I used Thai Coconut Curry chicken broth and it was SO flavorful!  I added shredded Romano cheese also.  It did the trick, my husband requested again the next day.

Love this soup as a base I can dress up.  I added a little dill, a little cider vinegar and a dash of splenda to make a great low-carb soup.  Didn't peel the peppers- just used my immersion blender and probably upped the fiber content a bit.  My husband can't get enough of this. And boy does it taste great the next day.  Just like stuffed peppers without the filling.

Fantastic recipe - the whole family loved it and my mom was flabbergasted!  I cooked the pepper for 20 minutes (until really soft) and only simmered them for about 5 minutes in the broth.  Then I pureed the soup, mixed in milk instead of cream, and served this with yummy homemade bread.  This made a very, very fast lunch & I'll definitely use this recipe over and over again.  Thanks!

Wonderful and easy.  I don't bother to strain it, I use half and half rather than cream, and I throw in some crushed red pepper for a little zip.  Fail safe.

I have several red pepper soup recipes, although I have not tried this one. I have one suggestion. Puree the peppers and tomatoes with about 2 cups of broth before cooking. Then, add the remainder of the broth and cook. I like to add a little Old Bay seasoning and taste as I go. I'd also skip the cream and add a 1/2 teaspoon of coffee creamer to each bowl. Stir and serve.

everybody in my family loved this soup! I did it almost exactly like the recipe said, the only thing being that I substituted basil for the bay leaf and added alot more cayenne pepper than called for.  I also meated it up with some grilled chicken chunks, but I don't think I'll do that again - the soup alone is awesome

Simple, tasty and inexpensive. Great soup! I highly recommend following other reviewer's suggestions of : pureeing with an immersion blender (no straining) and also, to add just a touch of cayenne if you like a bit of kick. 

Fantastic soup..Thanks for posting the recipe!

Awesome, easy to make soup.  I roasted my red peppers for a little over an hour beforehand.  I sauteed the onions and garlic and slightly burnt them, added the red peppers, and then chicken broth.  I pureed it in my blender and heated it back up and added milk and voila!  Delicious.  No need for extra spices or anything.  Yum.

Made this tonight for the first time.  It is FABULOUS!  Glad I read the reviews first.  I used red, orange and yellow peppers and I didn't strain it after blending.  I will definitely make this again as a first course for company dinner.

Very bland soup to me.   I don't think it had enough red pepper flavor.  I'm willing to try this recipe again but I will double the amount of peppers.  I did do it a little different than recipe though.  I actually roasted the peppers first and at the end of the dish I added crab.  Only after adding another pepper (I had one extra on hand), SALT, cayenne pepper, rosemary and more black pepper did I think it was ok.  I only wish I had more bell peppers.  I gave this four stars because it has potential, but as is  it only merits two or three stars.

Excellent taste.   Soup is on the thin side tho.   I used yellow, gold & red peppers as that is what I had in the freezer ---also added more than the recipe called for.   Usee a hand blender and didn't strain it.   Was a great dinner with some saltines.

This soup was awesome.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is b/c I made some changes after reading other people's reviews.  I added salt.  Also I used water instead of chicken broth.  I replaced the heavy cream with evaporated milk and added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I didn't completely puree it.  It was delicious and I can't wait to make some more.

Yum! I used 5 cups of red peppers and substituted fat-free evaporated milk for the heavy cream. The soup was perfect -- rich and delicious, but not too heavy and over-the-top flavorful/salty. It was really awesome. I kept picturing eating it during a fancified "ladies lunch" with elegant grilled sandwiches and a salad. Perfection!

Great Soup!  My husband and I liked it, the kids didn't.  I will make this again.  I was following the recipe when my husband tossed in some crushed red pepper flakes, while the peppers were simmering .  I don't know how much he put in there, but it turned out excellent.  I bit spicy but good.
I didn't want to strain out the healthy/hearty stuff so I just put about a cup or two in the food processor for about a minute, and it came out very smooth, pureed, and thick for a good soup.   Great served with crackers or sourcream.

This is a great recipe!  All of my neighbors asked for it.  The 2nd time I made it I pureed it in my food processor and forgot I had it running.  It ended up pureeing for about 10 minutes.  It required very little straining due to this and, too my surprise, was very smooth. It was beneficial because the first time I didn't feel that it made enough but with the extra pureeing it made just that much more.

This recipe is one of the best I have ever tried.  I made it for a soup course at my last Thanksgiving celebration and it went so quickly that I am making it a permanent staple of the meal.  In fact, my family and freinds loved it so much that I am going to double the recipe for this years dinner (which is amazing since the soup is the first in a 7 course meal).  My husband is such a fan of the soup that he has started to beg me to make it for everyday lunches and dinners.

Looved it!! Be careful to use a not so spicy broth, it doesn't let that nice sweet Red Pepper flavor take over. I took the advice of another review and roaseted them..mmmmm. Excellent!!

I made this for a luncheon party.  The women loved it.  It was light enough to start the meal.  It is a great color and flavor.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream that I mixed with purchased pesto. I also doubled it with great results.

This soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD good!  This is a very easy recipe... and it tastes terrific!  I do not drain it through a sieve though, we eat it as is after the blending...we like the tiny pieces and the consistency of the soup!  My whole family (young kids included)devoured it and want me to make more!  Great for a fall's evening dinner!

This turned out very nice. It didn't need any salt and was very creamy, slightly tart, and quite savory. I added one chopped habanero pepper and used an immersion blender. I also made this for my vegetarian wife so used vegetable broth instead.

The children said, it’s better than regular tomato soup. Muahahaha, that’s because it’s not. BTW, they won’t eat red peppers...

This was fantastic!! Like the other commenters, I roasted the red bell peppers before adding to the soup. I just used a little bit of canola oil on the peppers and tossed them under the broiler, turning every minute or so until a bit charred. Afterwards I removed the seeds and stem, and tossed it in the stock like the recipe says. 

I also listed to another commenter on here and used some fresh thyme. Immersion blender or  vitamix is the way to go to get the super velvety soup ideal. 

I 100% will be making this again.

This soup is my favorite! I always double the recipe and freeze some. The flavor really changes depending on the chicken broth you use, so make sure to get a good one!

I had bought too many red peppers for a vegetable tray, so I decided to give this soup a try even though I had never eaten red pepper soup before. Next time, I will go lighter on the onions since their taste seemed to overpower the peppers. I also added just a touch of sweetener. This was really warming and good on a cold, wintry day.

Awesome recipe and soup! Made it for Christmas dinner and had a lot of compliments. I made homemade croutons to add to the soup which was s hit as well. Definitely a keeper for future entertaining.

Used an extra tablespoon of butter and sautéed the vegetables an extra 10 minutes. I used unsalted butter and low sodium chicken broth, so had to add some salt. Also used an immersion blender while soup still in the pan and while adding cream. No need to put through a strainer. Perfectly smooth and delicious.

Really good!  I caught a great sale on red peppers, and was glad to find this recipe.  I had a few carrots and some leftover cauliflower, so I added them to the mix.  I also added some spices - curry powder and cayenne pepper.  And, truth be told, I did dump in a bit more than 1/2 cup of the cream, mmmm, mmmm.

Fantastic recipe! Personal alterations: broiled peppers in olive oil, salt and pepper, used half and half instead of heavy cream, and didn't strain the soup. Used an immersion blender. Topped with sour cream, salt, pepper and a few shakes of dried cilantro. Served with toasted whole grain bread. Delicious.

This was the BEST soup I have ever had!! I did make some changes but the base is so simple and delicious.  
I added basil and thyme.  I also separated the veggies from broth when I pureed it in my processor.   I also had some Ritz cracker with it.  Yummo!!!

I use this a s a basic recipe.  Sometimes I add shrimp, crab or whatever I have handy and it makes a delicious filling dinner.   Sometimes I only make a small amount and let it thicken andIpour it over some seared seafood.

I loved it!  I am too lazy to roast peppers so I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for it.  After reading some of the reviews I think I would add a potato next time.  I also had 1 oz. of cream cheese that I needed to use so I put that in too.  Amazing!

I made this soup exactly as the recipe calls for. I simplified it by omitting the straining (not necessary) and using my immersion blender in the stock pot that I used to cook the vegetables. So good that I made another batch a week later. Serve with a dollop of sour cream. Delicious!

I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe but the flavor was a little bland.  I found that by adding balsamic vinegar it helped bring the red pepper flavor out.

I added 48 oz chicken broth and 3 guajillo chili peppers in addition to the red peppers in the recipe.  Add salt to taste. Definitely use an immersion blender.. much easier...  Excellent soup!  Would give it more stars if I could..

I modified this recipe for 2 people, as I had two peppers. The adjustments may not have worked out correctly, as the finished soup tasted quite bitter. I ended up adding sugar, salt, and some ketchup, which reduced the bitterness but did not get rid of it entirely. Plus, even before adding ketchup. the red pepper flavour was hardly noticeable. I might make it again, but try a different recipe.

The soup is good but bland, I had to add extra seasoning. Also, I recommend straining the soup before eating. Without the cream, the soup is pretty thin and also could benefit from a protein to make a more filling meal.

Great recipe didn’t change a thing. Due to the fact that this is all I was serving for dinner I did add some Italian hot sausage that was previously browned when I added the heavy cream. It made a complete meal.

I used this recipe to adjust using 25 peppers.  I LOVE All Recipes for this.  I put in cans of 4 cans of tomatoes and left out the heavy cream.  Just too heavy and fattening for us to eat as a main.  Will make it over and over with these adjustments.

Simple and light! As the lucky recipient of eight large red peppers that needed to be used in a hurry, this recipe (doubled) was perfect! I didn't have cream on hand, so I figured I would add it later, but for me, this soup didn't need it. 
I used the kind of chicken bouillon that is a paste, and that added a nice saltiness. 
In short, this is an easy, low-calorie soup that tastes heavenly.

Color turned out more of an orange color, but tasted well. I added some red pepper flakes for some heat. Perfect when served with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream! ??

My daughter has a tomato allergy, and I've spent YEARS trying to find a good tomato sauce substitute. While this soup is not thick like sauce, it is very versatile and wonderfully flavorful. I always roast the red peppers, which gives it a smoky richness. While I agree adding the cream unfortunately changes the color from luscious red to a brighter orange, I find the dairy brings an extra fullness to the flavor. Great as soup, great as enchilada sauce, great over pasta. For our allergy situation, this soup has opened new worlds of flavor!

I wanted to make a low cal version, so I omitted the cream and added a can of crushed tomatoes, while  tripling the amount of peppers but only had yellow and orange peppers ( I had a large amount of peppers to get rid of).    I roasted the peppers first, but sautéed the onions.    You'd never know the cream wasn't there, and you can't tell the tomatoes are in there.   Just a great taste of a thick red pepper bisque.   So delicious.

I made this with other reviewers recommendations such as roasting (in my case grilling) the peppers and removing the skin and puree with the garlic and onions (with a little chicken broth) in the magic bullet THEN added to the chicken stock. Was surprisingly delicious as I don't even like peppers.

Light and tasty soup. I added a bay leaf,a dash of Tabasco and a couple if table spoons of red wine vinegar. For cold winter days, I could see thickening it with a little flour and water. Hubby said it was "super tasty!"

This is a wonderful soup!!  Will make this again as soon as red peppers are on sale.  Recipe only serves 5 but will definitely double it next time.  I pureed the soup in the blender so I didn't bother straining it.

Absolutely delicious soup - and so easy to make.  After simmering the soup put just the solid parts  through the blender and pureed it well - no sign of the pepper peel left, so no need to strain.  Added back to the soup liquid in the pot, along with about 1/4 cup 10% cream  pinch of cayenne and about 2 teaspoons splenda.  Perfect.   Thanks for a great soup!

Instead of putting the hot liquid into the blender to process, I did as a few reviewers suggested. After sauteeing the peppers, onion, etc, I let it cool a bit and pureed THAT. After I transferred to the pot and added the chicken broth, I was hoping to not have to strain the soup, but after I tasted it, I didn't like the texture. So strain it I did. I didn't have the heavy cream on hand, so I used 2% milk; it came out on the thin side, but the flavor was good. Maybe next time I'll have the heavy cream available or grate in a potato as someone suggested. I also  added some cayenne for kick; I like spicy and think I gave one shake too many! :)  Great soup, though, and especially good on a cold day.

NEVER PUT HOT LIQUIDS IN A BLENDER! Some of you might get away with it, depending on the actual temperature and your particular blender, but others will have an explosion of hot liquids all over yourself and your kitchen. Use an immersion blender, or cook the veggies and puree separately, before adding broth, but even then you still need to be careful.
Regarding the varieties of opinions about the flavor: the key to this soup is to start with quality ingredients. Some of the most beautiful-looking peppers at the big grocery store have almost no flavor, when compared to those ugly ones you might find at the farmer's market or grow yourself. Add a handful of fresh spices (I used basil and some chives, and a bit of dried paprika as well) and you'll also see a marked improvement. You might also consider making this a day ahead, letting it cool, refrigerating it overnight (right in the pot if you have room in your fridge) and then reheating before eating it the next day, to bring out more of the individual flavors. The soup I ended up with was quite good.

Made a couple of times now & it is a little time consuming with my changes, but worth it. I took others suggestions & roast the peppers. Peeling is a pain, but like I said, worth it. I do add 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper & 1/4 c coffee mate creamer so I can use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

it was fantastic!! And it was easy. I dont care for peppers or onions but have been crazing red pepper soup for over a week and it definitely hit the spot. I love the taste difference between with sour cream and without.

This was delicious! I tried posting a picture of it, but it ended up upside down for some reason. I added an extra clove of garlic and pureed it all together with an emulsifier. This method could not have been easier. I topped it with shredded parmesan cheese and buttered toasties. Yum!

I had a curried red pepper soup at a restaurant a few years ago and have been trying to find a similar recipe. I made a few changes to this recipe but i am confident it is great as is! I used 5 large red shepherd peppers (as they are in season and on sale), I added a few jalapeño peppers because they are fresh in my garden. As these were sautéing with the onion and garlic I added 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder. I increased the amount of stock to 1800 ml. Simmered for 2 hours then put through the food processor and then through the blender. I did not add any cream as the soup was nice and thick. Mmmmmmmm

For a very HEALTHY soup, it so flavourful.  I just love it.  Hardly any effort to making it.  Just too easy.  I get great reviews on it when I serve it to people.  Even they're surprised.  Cost very little to make especially when you buy the ingredients on sale at the grocery store.  I can serve 3 big bowls using the measurements given.

This soup is amazing. I love it. So healthy. There is no reason NOT to roast the peppers in the oven though, its a must. Just put them in whole on a baking pan at 450 for about 40 minutes, turning halfway. Let cool and the skin falls off, and easy to seed. Yum Yum YUM! Always serve with fresh bread or garlic rolls.

This soup is amazing. I've made it a few times, making it vegetarian by subbing vegetarian vegetable stock for the chicken stock. The last time I made the soup, I made it vegan by adding in two small red potatoes in step 2 (the starch does a great job of mimicking the cream), and omitting the cream in step 3. Overall, this is a recipe you can bank on, with great versatility for other vegetable soups.

Great recipe! Great flavours! Definitely going to make it again and will double or triple it next time as I found it only made 3-4 servings.

I cooked the onions until really soft and almost browned - I think this added amazing flavour. I added a tsp or so of fresh thyme to the sauteing onions, garlic and red peppers. I only used 3 peppers because the 4th pepper didn't look great. I also used 1/2 cup 10% cream as I felt it would be too creamy with full fat. Could even skip the cream as it's delicious without it and would keep the red pepper flavours strong. I used powdered bouillon chicken stock because that's what I had on hand and I think it was tastier than regular stock. 

I found straining it difficult and messy but that could be because I have a really small sieve. Blending it was easy with my hand blender. 

My hubby really loved this soup and dipping pumpernickel bread into it. Great for a cold day/evening.

I loved not having to take the skin off the peppers, so this recipe worked for me!  I added a couple tablespoons of merlot while the onion, garlic, and peppers sauteed, and it gave it a nice tang!  Yum!  Thanks SO much for this recipe...great for my child with braces!

Quite delicious -- I left the skins on peppers I roasted (that's where the vitamins and fiber are!) and still ended up with a smooth soup after using an immersion blender.  Next time I would add some kick by spicing it up with red pepper flakes.

This is a very easy soup to make, and with some changes it is five-star worthy.  Since I'm vegetarian I used veggie broth rather than chicken broth.  the only other changes I made was adding 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper (I like things very spicy), and adding 1 tomato. this is a great soup and so easy.  Its great with the cream, but I think it would be just as good without (and healthier, of course).  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this soup, but I made some changes to make it healthier (and easier).

1) I substituted 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the butter.  I used Kangaroo Paw Mountain Pepper olive oil, so it lent a nice spiciness.

2) I used a 19 ounce jar of red peppers instead of the fresh peppers.

3) I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

4) Instead of using heavy cream, I put in a can of drained, rinsed garbanzo beans when I added the broth.

5) I didn't strain or blend the soup.  Instead, I used my immersion blender. 

The final result was that the whole pot of soup only had 690 calories and 21g of fat.  Yum yum!

I made this for the second time tonight.  The first time was DELICIOUS!  This time I followed the advice to puree before adding the broth.  This is a BAD IDEA.  My soup tonight was really lumpy and lacked flavor.  Sad.  I will continue to make this soup, but will puree last next time.

I made the soup exactly as written and found it to be very easy and had a nice mild flavor.  If I were to make it again I would add just a little spice to take it to the next level.

there's sth missing... the recipe gives a great base, but the flavor isn't strong enough... I still haven't figured out what to add.. maybe cumin or masala... or simply more garlic or black pepper...

Thanks for the idea! This is a great recipe and you can add other flavors to it if desired.  I used evap milk instead and added a teaspoon of chili paste for some heat.  Also added a handful of fresh spinach to the food processor when blending.  Great color!

I did not roast the peppers but I think I will next time. It was still very good I served it in bread bowls. (a recipe I got from this site) It went over very well at one of my girl's nights, next time I also would like to try sprinkling feta before serving.

Delicious! Made just as given with the tiny exception that I roasted the peppers in the oven as another reviewer suggested. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, because that's what I had. A huge hit. The entire family loved it. A note: We thought it was even better the next day. Thanks Judi, a great recipe!

This is now one of my favorite soups! The only thing I did differently was  roasted the peppers first. All I did was cut the peppers in half and put them under the broiler for about 20 minutes. I peeled the skin off after they cooled. It's so easy and you don't have to strain it afterward.

This tasted good. I wasn't quite sure if i loved it, or if i was grossed out by it, but i think i liked it. Pretty much tasted like Red Pepper Soup. I would make it again, but only as a side dish to a meal, not as a main dish.

I found this recipe when trying to find something new to use up ALL my peppers from my CSA box. This is a keeper! My husband and I both loved it. The only thing I added was a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

My first experience with Red Pepper Soup was at a restaurant and it was so very delicious.  My good fortune when this recipe appeared.  A very basic, easy recipe (and I am not much of a cook).  I was not disappointed.  As is, it does lack flavor.  The reviews helped but I chose to add Paprika instead of something hotter.  It was good but still a little bland.  Next time, I will try Coriander or Thyme as others suggested and see what happens.   For a basic recipe, this is defintely a keeper.

This is delicious! Versatile! Impressive! Beautiful! 
I did change it a bit based on other reviews and my personal preferences, making it a bit simpler...I baked the peppers in the oven until the skins were black, let them cool, peeled the skins. Threw them in a pot with the broth, seasonings, simmered for 30 minutes. Let cool, whisked in blender. Returned to pot, added cream. I wanted a very simple, fresh taste, so I used garlic and onion powders. I also added a touch of ground CORIANDER and honey. This was divine and will definitely be served at my next summer party! 

The versatile part was the remainder of the soup, which I altered for husband-I added cooked ground apple sausage, sauteed with diced onions- equally wonderful! We had it with sourdough bread-woooooow! He loved it, which is a surprise b/c he is not a big fan of red peppers.

This is not the quickest "slap something together" recipe, but if you're in the mood to make something rewarding, healthy, delicious and lovely, this is it. This is a soup that will stay in my recipe box ALWAYS!

4 out of 5 people in my family, including the 5 year old, LOVED it! I used two red, one yellow and 3/4 of an orange bell pepper.  I added a handful of chopped carrots and about a 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms.  To boost the heart-healthy factor, I added 3 TBSP of ground flax and substituted the heavy cream with 1/4 cup each of plain fat free yogurt and fat free half-n-half (let come to room temp before adding to soup).  I also used a hand-held immersion blender to produce a silky smooth soup.  I'll absolutely be making this one again!

Tasty but time consuming!  
Changes:
* left garlic cloves whole
* sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil in stead of butter while i broiled then peeled bell peppers
* 6 colorful bell peppers, cut into strips
* one chicken bullion cube dissolved in 2 cups hot water

It tasted really good before i added nonfat dry milk, black pepper, and a dab of sour cream.

Don't bother with the spices or dairy-- it's delicious plain!  And I'm the kind of person who likes spicy food.

I've made this soup twice so far. Doubled it the second time. Fantastic!
My family couldn't get enough.

I was expecting great things from this soup given the reviews it got, but my husband and I both disliked it.  My husband thought it was too bland (even though I added cayenne pepper) and I just didn't like the taste.  It was tolerable with sour cream, but we threw away the leftovers.

This is a great satisfying soup.  I broil the red peppers and then put them in a bag to peel them.  After, I put them in the pot and cook.  Then I throw everything into a blender.  By broiling and peeling them first it makes the soup easier and quicker.  Besides you get that great roasted red pepper taste.

It was ok.  I halved the recipe, and used a 1:4 butter/milk substution for the heavy cream, and put in less than called for.  It was still very creamy.  It is my first time trying red pepper soup, so perhaps it's just my taste buds.  Presentation is beautiful, though.  Sprinkle with fresh parsley.

This was pretty good, however I had to add about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt.  The taste seemed flat, but the salt helped.  We thought a garnish of something like croutons might be a nice addition also.

I used roasted red peppers instead.  Everyone at the table asked for the recipe.

What a delicious soup! The color was beautiful. Loved the subtle flavor. Because I used a jar of roasted red peppers from Trader Joe's and frozen diced onions, this came together superfast. Cannot wait to make this for friends. I did up the amount of heavy cream a little and added a tad of seasoning salt.

Very nice.  I've made it a few times already & have to say the color is lovely with red or yellow peppers, but DON'T try it with green or cheat by adding a few green ones to the mix as the color will turn you off before the first spoonful.

Nice recipe.  Next time I won't bother straining the soup - it turned out a little thin.  In any case, I'm using what was in the strainer as a red pepper spread for crackers and toast.
