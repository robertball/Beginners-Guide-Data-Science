I work as a professional chef, went to school after years of learning in the field.  I only have one change to make to this recipe.  It works well and is how I roast most squash with similar flesh, as some one else said that the olive oil smoked.  You can raise the Flashpoint of olive oil ( don't use extra virgin for cooking ) add canola oil to regular olive oil and you can avoid the smoke and still benefit from the flavor of olive oil.  Hope this helps

It didn't dawn on me that olive oil wouldn't be the best to use for this until I noticed the smoke in the house...olive oil doesn't have a high enough smoke point to tolerate 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  A butter/olive oil blend would work better and add to the flavor too.  Also, I should've cooked it longer after flipping the squash because I would've like it a little bit more browned.  Other than that-simple and excellent.  Delicata has a delicious flavor on its own and a simple recipe like this lets that shine through.

Simple, just how I like my vegetables.  I used butter like suggested by another reviewer.  Baked it upright, didn't need to be flipped.  Turned out perfect.

Simple recipe. Elegant flavor. Yes, bake the squash flesh-down and use olive oil (the higher quality the better), but I did turn the oven down to 350ish to reduce smoking. MUST use olive oil for a better roasted/nutty flavor.

Plain and easy and tasty. I used butter instead of olive oil.

Delicata squash is just plain darn tasty. This is my favorite way to have it, no sweetener or other spices needed. Just simple and delicious.

Yummy. I would only change one thing. I would add a tap of Tapitio. I had lots of ideas but I love this squash just how it is.

I liked this a lot! It was the first time I had eaten or made delicata squash, but it was delicious and really easy to do. :)

12.02.16 ~ Loved this recipe. I did skin and dice the flesh and then proceeded with the recipe. I have also made the recipe as written, but I liked it diced, the best. It makes a delicious vegetable to pack in my lunch (I get tired of packing lunches!). I've also used this for acorn squash - same results, delicious!

Preparing this way really lets the flavor of each individual squash to come through. One doesn't taste exactly like another.

Super easy and so delicious! With this recipe you can season this anyway you like- I used garlic infused olive oil and a bit of allspice. My dog went crazy for this too and she doesn't usually eat vegetables. Thank You!
