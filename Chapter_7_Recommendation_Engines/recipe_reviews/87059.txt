SOOO good.  About half way through dinner, my 4 year old asked whether we can have this again.  I made a few changes: I sauted the onion in a bit of oil first and then added chicken breasts, carrots and broth.  When it came time to fry the chicken and carrots for 2 mins, I did it in about a teaspoon of oil instead of one and a quarter cups.  (I used a slotted spoon to get most of the chicken and carrots out, fried them and then put them back into the pot with the broth.)  I layered the rice and seasoning mixture on top of that.  I also added about a cup of frozen peas, and they worked really well with the recipe.  I toasted the almonds in the toaster oven instead of in the oil.  My modifications did change the overall presentation (more "mixed" chicken and rice than "upside down") but I cut almost 2 cups of oil from the recipe.  And it was still really really good.

The ratio of rice to liquid is way off. Even though I knew better, I went ahead and followed the recipe using 4 cups of rice. After 30 min. the rice wasn't even close to being done. I added several cups of chicken stock, another onion, 1 cup of chopped celery and more cinnamon to fix it. I had an enormous pot of chicken and rice to deal with. It actually tasted good, so next time I will use 2 and 1/2 cups of rice instead.

My parents are from the Middle East so I grew up with this food as a regular. But we make it with eggplants and potatoes that are halfway fried before put with the rice. Yummy!!!

My husband really liked the cinnamon in this recipe, much to my surprise. The nuts are a great part of it, too. This is a recipe I'll definitely use often - easy for weeknights. I read the reviews and mostly followed the recipe. I used 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts - the whole chicken parts with bones in would probably add flavor and have made it a bit better. I boiled the chicken, carrots and onion in 4 cups chicken broth then reused the broth for cooking the rice. I sauteed the chicken and carrots in a few tablespoons of olive oil before adding the rice, and I only added 2 1/2 cups rice after reading other reviews. This required 5 cups of liquid but I only had 4 cups of broth reserved after boiling the chicken so I added 1 cup of water to the rice mixture. Next time I'll only use 2 cups of rice so I can use the 4 cups of broth and make it more flavorful. I also like the idea of adding raisins and will try that in the future.

I made this awhile ago, and changed a few things, I used ground cinnamon, not sticks and used chicken breast.  We also thought it would be really good cooked with rasains, but it was an afterthought, and we didn't have any on hand.  This recipe was VERY good!

I didn't use any oil whatsoever in the recipe. The aroma of cinnamon while cooking was nice. As for the flavors, I suspect I must have added too much pepper, since I didn't measure, just eyeballed it. It left a lingering spice in my mouth. I didn't really care for the nuts in mine (my husband initially thought it was chicken bones). I added peas as suggested, and didnt have raisins as recommended. Overall, it reminded me of paella without the seafood, and cinnamon in its place.

Like other reviewers, I skipped the frying portion.. more like a saute. I also added peas (1/4 cup).   This recipe was OK - I think it was a little bland. The nuts added to the flavor, so if anything, next time I'll add more.

Made this last night and turned out great.  I used olive oil and 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and cut the recipe in half.  Cut chicken into pieces after boiling.  Also used green bell peppers instead of carrots, since I was out.  Just sauteed them with half a large onion before adding the cut chicken.  Topped with toasted almonds to cut out oil.  Excellent, and kids loved it.

I am not sure what it is missing. It was good and I'll probably make it again. Someone suggested raisins. I added some and may add more next time. This was easy and we had most ingredients in the house, which is always a plus!

this was really good. the only things I did differently: used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added in about a cup of frozen peas as another reviewer suggested, and cut waaaaay back on the oil. although i was tempted to toast the nuts in the oil, i just toasted them in a dry pan. and when i fried the chicken and carrots before adding the rice, etc., i only put in a tablespoon or two versus 1/4 cup.  i also tried to cut down on the number of dirty pans, though technically i dirtied more plates and bowls in the process. for instance, i didn't want to fry the chicken and carrots in a new pot, so i just removed the main solid contents to a plate and poured the stock into a bowl, then poured 3 cups of this into a 4-cup Pyrex liquid measuring cup. (BTW, the recipe is set up to make 12 servings so make sure to pare it down; I went to four.)  otherwise, the only other thing i'd do differently in the future is skip the aforeto mentioned frying of the chicken and carrots. i don't think it's worth the effort.

My mother in law is Jordanian. This is called Magluba in Arabic. My favorite dish that she makes.  There are no carrots in it, or almonds.
There is cauliflower, chickpeas and pine nuts that are cooked along with the whole thing not fried or toasted in oil. Want to eat it authenticly...dump it out on a huge platter and grab some pita bread and use it as your fork/spoon to eat and enjoy.

This recipe is pretty good!  I learned how to make this dish from an Israeli friend of mine.    The ingredients and technique are pretty close to the way I was taught.
What I really like about this dish is that it's not spicy, yet it is full of flavor.  That's where my 4 star rating comes into play.  I have a jar of Makluba seasoning which has more than just the cinnamon.   That really was what made it difficult for me to give it 5 stars.  Everything else is great, but made this way, I'm afraid, would be too bland.
I love this recipe and will be using it again as it is the closest to what I have come to know of this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

it's a good recipe, it's a bit far off from the original middle eastern dish called maklooba which literally translates into flipped rather than upside down. the veggies used typically are cauliflower potatoes and most importantly eggplants. The method and the spices used differ a bit as well.

Tasty dish and pretty easy to make!  I would definitely make this again.  Wish it was just a little creamier though.  And I would try to reduce the amount of oil that's used.  Love the nuts because they give the dish a little more texture. The cinnamon is a nice touch.  I was unsure of using it, but it really adds flavor to everything!  YUM!

I made the recipe exactly as stated, no alterations.  Thought it was a little bit bland, and very oily.  I just read through it to make sure I didn't make a mistake and I don't think I did.  Won't be making this again.
