Wow! My taste buds are still in heaven. This recipe ranks up as one of my favorites. I would make a few suggested changes. reduce the Cayenne, I like it hot but that is way over the top. I would use a dash or two for starters. boneless chicken thighs are a good substitute, they remain more moist. I would use one pepper with the seeds chopped. If you are going to use coconut milk, use the real stuff, eat less if you have to, its worth the flavor. one final suggestion, add the chicken back into the sauce for 15min on simmer.

WOW! I followed the recipe except I left out the cayanne (because of my kids)and used canned tomatoes. I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered in the sauce for a few minutes. I served it w/white rice and fried plantains. My husband raved and so did my kids. Reminds me of a curry almost but with better flavor. This one is a keeper!

Missing link - BASIL

I made the recipe according to directions and tore up a little basil (rather than parsley) after seasoning it to taste.  The basil added a little kick and some more sweetness.  Try it!

WOW!  This was so good I didn't want to stop eating!  I did tweak it based off other reviews of bland sauce.  I started by softening the chopped onion in the olive oil. I then added my cut up chicken breast (I forgot to rub in the seasoning first).  I evenly sprinkeld the seasoning mix over the chicken, added minced garlic and let it cook.  After the chicken was mostly cooked through I added a can of diced tomatoes, sprinkled the ginger, olive oil, and garlic powder over the tomatoes, added hot diced green chilis and mixed it all into the chicken. I let it simmer for about 10 minutes, added the coconut milk and let simmer another 5 minutes.  I served it over Basmati rice.  Next time I will add diced potatoes to the dish.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish was!  I tried it because I thought it might be good, but it was just great!!! Don't forget to season the chicken and the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. I think that maybe a couple of reviewers may have forgotten, which led to their conclusions that this was bland. It was absolutely delicious! Thanks!

This was a very simple, spicy chicken dish that my wife and I both really enjoyed.  Without question a 5 star.

This was SO GOOD. I made some changes because we're a family on a budget; we bought a whole chicken, cut it into pieces and removed the skin, rubbed with the spice mixture (I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp since we have small children) and then baked the chicken at 375 degrees for 40 minutes, covered with aluminum foil. For the sauce we just used one jalapeno, and we used half a can of (drained) diced tomatoes since it was mid-winter and the tomatoes in the store looked unripe.   This recipe was so fantastic, even our toddler was gobbling up the chicken as fast as we could hand him pieces! I feel like inviting people over for dinner now just so I can serve them this recipe, LOL.

This was a nice change.  It's incredibly spicy, which suited our tastes just fine.  Next time I think I'll simmer the chicken in the sauce for a bit so it can soak up some of the flavors.

I just made this for the first time and we loved it!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper like the other reviews advised.  I used 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs and remembered to season the chicken with salt and pepper before rubbing the other spices on.  I let the chicken sit with the spice rub for 2 hours in the fridge before browning it.  I also sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the onion, tomato mixture while that was cooking.  After adding the coconut milk, I placed the chicken back in the sauce and let simmer for about 10 minutes.  We had it over white rice and it was amazing!

Wow, everytime I think I've found my favourite recipe on this site another one comes along that's even better!  This was amazingly good and I want to make it everyday!
I also used canned diced tomatoes and cut my chicken into smaller chunks.  It turned out like a curry...sooo good.  I'll definitely make this one again!

When I first read the recipe, it sounded like an Indian curry but the end result is definitely South American. I used 2 onions and regular coconut milk. I substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes. I made chicken + sauce in one pot. I sauteed the onions, garlic, ginger and peppers before adding in the chicken. After adding the coconut milk, it tasted too sweet initially. However, the parsley truly balanced out all the flavours. It was delicious on its own. I served it with the Brazilian Rice and Cuban Black Beans recipes from this site. Oh and we had plantains too. Truly marvelous meal that you can put together in an hour on a weekday. Thanks for sharing!

This has great flavor.  A new chicken favorite for my household.  Nice amount of spice, although I only used 1 pepper.  To complete the meal, I made the Brazilian rice from this site and string beans.  The combination of the rice and string beans helped with toning down the spice, but a great meal nonetheless.

This. Is. Amazing. I selected it for my mom to cook and she said she kept it the same except being a little heavy handed with the spice measurements, cutting back a bit on the coconut milk and using diced tomatoes. It was sooooo tasty and a nice kick of heat. Absolutely love it and is now our dish to try out on guests next time. Yum. thanks!!!!

This was SO good.  My modifications: -2 tsp. garam masala subbed for cayenne and coriander in spice rub.  -dredged the chicken in flour after rubbing with salt, pepper, and spices, before sauteeing -omitted jalapenos -omitted fresh ginger (but I'll use it next time, just didn't have any on hand) -used whole coconut milk, 'cause I'm crazy like that  -used chopped fresh basil per another reviewer, and it was fantastic. -also diced the chicken and added it to the sauce, then simmered it all for about 20 minutes. Added a little extra salt to taste. The flour-dredging helped thicken up the sauce a little, too.  My husband, 5yo, and 3yo devoured this. So did I!  Garnished with flake coconut and chopped cashews.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good. Nice way to change things up from the munndane chicken to something very flavorful and different. My husband said it tasted like a taco. I used canned dieced tomatoes, and canned diced green chiles. I liet the chicken simmer in the sauce for about 20 minutes . I served it with brown rice and fried plantains. Very tasty! I just wish it had more of a coconut flavor, but everything I've ever made with coconut milk doesn'tactually taste like coconuts so I didn't deduct from that. I think next time I will try basil instead of parsley as a reviewer had mentioned. Great recipe!!

I used a green bell pepper instead of the jalapeno and we really enjoyed it.  Served with Brazilian white rice.

I just finished making this tasty and pretty simple dish.  You're right, the house was filled with fragrant cumin and onion aromas.  The tomatoes gives the sauce a very nice finish.  I would add salt to the coconut milk sauce as well. I added two additional cloves of garlic - love the stuff.   Just enough bite from the jalapenos.  Sliced the chicken once finished so it would be easier to eat.  Served it over Calrose rice.  Yummmm yum.  I will add plantains as a side for it next time.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband said that to call this Brazilian, there must be a town in India called Brazil.  Too spicy for me, but he loved it.  I didn't find the sauce bland, but I did reduce it in the skillet.

Having made this a couple times now, its official, I like it.  Of course having lived in Brazil, that tempts me to get a little tropical taste now and then.    A real brazillian would serve this over rice as I did, and its not too bad.  My kids were a little hesitant, but for the most part it won them over.  I substituted roasted anaheims for Jalapeno peppers and in absense of fresh ginger, used a little powdered and worked out great too. Good flavor.

This was the first thing I have made since starting to be a serious cook that my husband had more of!  He kept saying "Go# Dam&" and rated it a 9.8... prior to this my highest was 8.2 :)  I did it to a T except used a can of drained diced tomatoes.

Meh. Chicken was great, put it on rice.  Would definitely make that again. I used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.

The sauce was just odd. My husband said he liked it, but it looked awful to me.  There's WAY too much coconut milk....I only used about a cup. And used diced tomatoes. It was really spicy as well.  I doubt I'll make the sauce again.

I did not have all the spices listed but it was still great!  Even the kids (ages 2, 4 and 6) loved it.

I use canned tomates instead of the fresh... tomaotes w/ jalapenos.. this is better than I was trying to match from a hotel buffet on the beach on our cruise to Brazil. My friends always request that I make this for them.. I used dried parsley often.. just as good flavor as the fresh.

Excellent! Spicy and sweet at the same time. I did everything as per the recipe and it turned out beautifully. The only thing I would try next time, is baking the chicken instead of pan frying. I found the chicken to be slightly dry and baking would ensure a juicier result. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a recipe with coconut milk because I've never cooked with it before. I'm so glad I found and used this recipe. It was very easy and very delicious; I kept going to the pot to taste the sauce. I couldn't improve the seasoning but I kept tasting it anyway!  My husband is lactose intolerant so he wouldn't eat it on the first day so I explained the differences between coconut milk and dairy. He tried it on the second day and loved it. Now he's asking me to make it again! LOL I served it with basmati rice; a delicious combination.

A great, spicy dish! I prepared it according to the exact quantities in the recipe, but cut the chicken into smaller pieces, simmered the veggie & coconut mixture together for about 10 minutes, then added back the chicken pieces, and simmered it all together for another 15 minutes. This ensured that the sauce absorbed all the spices from the chicken rub, and thickened to a more desirable consistency. I served it over bulgar wheat, with fried plantains on the side, which made for a delicious combination of sweet & spicy! Next time, I plan on finishing the dish with Thai basil, rather than parsley, as the recipe tastes more Thai then Brazilian to me.

My husband made this for me tonight.  He's not the most practiced of cooks and if he can make it taste good it must be an excellent recipe.  I thoroughly enjoyed this. A bit spicy for me though, I added plain yoghurt to mine to temper it. It only gets 4 rather than 5 stars because of the misnaming.  It's not really Brazilian tasting but it still tastes pretty darn good.  Hubby used canned tomatoes, the chicken was cut into smaller pieces, he reduced the sauce a bit and we went without parsley.  It was in no way bland (and we do not agree with meat and veg meals), maybe those people had tasteless tomatoes or low quality spices?

This was absolutely delicious!! I used 8 chicken thighs instead of breasts, just due to personal preference. I had to add a half teaspoon more of each spice to make enough rub to coat the chicken. Really make sure to get that rub on all areas of the chicken as it's just amazing, with a perfect amount of heat. I made exactly as written, only adding about 4-5 good grinds of sea salt to the sauce as it warmed. I served over basmati rice and everyone just loved it. The best part is that this was a very easy recipe, especially for such excellent results. I know I'll be making this again and again because it's truly the type of dish that has that crave-ability factor. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe, Mylin!

This recipe needs some love. First off, it is not that spicy. When cooking jalapenos, they lose the majority of their spiciness so that does not add much flavor. I would double, or triple the amount of spices, salt and pepper asked for, add some fresh herbs if you have them(we used chives, sage, and lavender but mint may be interesting), a bit of honey is helpful as well and I would recommend using nonlight coconut milk. It is a promising dish that I hope to perfect in the future!

This was a true hit at my house. I changed 2 things because I was feeding it to 2 children. Instead of jalapeno peppers I just put green bell peppers and I did not add the cayenne pepper. I thought that would be too spicy for the kids. I did load it up with ginger, and it gives it that little kick. I also simmered it in coconut milk for a while in low heat. Everyone had seconds. I will add  this to my recipe book. Thank you very much.

That was one of the best dishes I have found on here.  The only change I made was cutting down the jalapeno's.  We have young kids so we cut the amount in half.  Still was very spicy and the kids had a hard time with it.  But both mommy and daddy absolutely loved it.  This is definitely going in our recipe box.

It was good but I've had better. I can't imagine using a whole tsp of cayenne. I barely used 1/4 tsp and it had just the right kick. I would make this again. Thanks!

Excellent!!! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I rubbed the spice mixture on the chicken a few hours before I cooked the dish. I also sliced the chicken into chunks after cooking it and returned it back to the sauce to simmer for about 5 minutes. I think I will add basil at the end next time as advised by another reviewer. Delicious!

This was surprisingly bland. Though, i had extra leftover chicken that I didn't put into the sauce, and made a really amazing chicken salad with it. Just some mayo and a little lemon, it was fantastic.

Absolutely wonderful!  A nice blend of spices to add a little kick in the pants (so to speak).  The perfect entre for guests with a pallet to handle South American cuisine.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars from my husband.  I prepared this meal especially for him because he likes spicy food.  I tried it, but my mouth was burning all night-I am defintely a mild to barely moderate spicy food person!  I didn't have jalapenos so I used two serrano chiles instead, and skipped the turmeric since I didn't have any.  Like another reviewer I cheated with canned tomatoes, but I don't think that made too much of a difference because it gets cooked anyway...we couldn't really taste the coconut milk and I used it fresh from the nut, but as I said my husband did enjoy it anyway!  I would like to try this again, with only a fraction of the cayenne pepper and no jalepenos or chiles for my sensitive taste buds!

My family loves Mexican and Indian recipes and this was a very good alternative--kind of a combination of the best of both cuisines.  I agree with another reviewer--it really is more of a curry, but with it's own unique blend of spices.  The only substitution I made was instead of the jalapeno pepper and tomatoes, I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalepenos.  Even the kids enjoyed this one!!!

This was very, very good. I couldn't follow exactly just because my family doesn't like spicy so I left out the jalapeno and only put a sprinkle of cayenne. We did use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes just because I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand. I could just make the tomato coconut sauce as a soup it was so good. I plan to make this again.

I've made this three times now.  The first time I didn't have any cayenne pepper, and so I used paprika instead.  I cooked everything together all at once, and I added some butter (for the tomatoes),  chicken broth, and Backy Eddy spice.  I let it simmer with the lid partially off to reduce and thicken the liquid.  It turned out great, and was very tasty!  The second time I made it, it wasn't as good because I cooked the stuff separately like the recipe says, and I ended up adding the same extra ingredients I did the first time.  The third time, I had the cayenne pepper.  I tripled the recipe and made it in my slow cooker, after browning the chicken, rubbed with the spices, in coconut oil.  Three teaspoons of cayenne pepper was way too much, and it wrecked the whole thing, as it was so hot that I couldn't eat it.  I just made it yesterday, and if anyone has any ideas on how to get rid of the hotness from the cayenne pepper, I may be able to salvage it.  That's the first and last time I will use cayenne pepper in a recipe.

We really loved this, but I must say, it's an Indian curry, not a South American anything.
It did have a bit of a kick to it, so if you can't handle heat, cut back on the cayenne pepper. Serving it with rice really tamed it down. I also thought it served more than 4. We cut the chicken into 1 inch chunks and then divided it into 6 servings and found it to be very filling (with rice). Next time I think I will try using regular coconut milk to get a bit more coconut flavor, and maybe topping it with toasted coconut flakes.
And there will definitely be a next time. This was delicious and easy!

I love this recipe & have made it 5 or 6 times over the past month!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I have since tweaked it & changed a few things to suit my taste.

I use "thin cut" chicken breasts from Wal-Mart. Saves you from having to halve them yourself.

I also add some bell pepper (I like yellow or orange, it makes it more colorful & "exotic" looking)..

To the sauce, I add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. My sauce is never bland.

I mix the seasoning in a ziploc bag, then add the chicken, making sure it gets all over each piece. I then let the chicken marinate for a couple hours in the fridge. I then cook it in olive oil & once all the chicken is done, I pour the sauce into the pan & let it "deglaze" and then I return the chicken to the pan and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.

Instead of coconut milk, you can use almond milk (unsweetened, plain) and add coconut flavoring or a little bit of coconut milk for a subtle coconut flavor. That cuts the fat & calories down significantly.

I chop the tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, jalapeno & garlic & add them all at the same time, so the flavors can merry. Once the tomatoes have "stewed", and the onions are done, I add the coconut/almond milk & let it simmer. Then once my chicken's cooked, I add the sauce to the chicken's pan & let it pick up all that flavor & return the chicken to the pan & let it simmer for 15-20 minutes & really get moist and tender. The spices mix in with the sauce, too. Yummy!

This recipe was really good. It's not hurting in flavor in anyway. I used canned diced tomatoes (not drained) and reudced that. I agree with some other reviewers that the sauce was really bland. I think next time I will try real coconut milk, not lite. I added sugar and salt to taste in order to enhance the flavor of the sauce. Also, the salt and pepper in the chicken seasoning is very important. I found it too be a little spicy, but definately not intolerable. Will definately make again!

I LOVED this!  Had it tonight over rice cooked in chicken broth and it was phenom!  I had no peppers and no fresh tomato, so I used Rotel, drained, in place of it.  Used dried ginger because I didn't have fresh... And looking at the recipe, I'm just now realizing that I forgot the parsley!  Oh well, I'll use it next time, and there WILL be a next time.  This was pretty spicy, but nicely balanced by the flavor of the coconut milk.

Super yummy! Made this on a whim, and am glad I did. I added the juice of half a lime and left out jalapenos (didn't have any on hand). Also used crushed tomatoes in a can. Husband and kids all loved it. Me too!

I made this without the jalepeno b/c I'm not too big on spicy.  It was awesome.  Then, I made it with shrimp over pasta, which was similar in its awesomeness.  When I was asked to come up with an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner, I made the shrimp dish and served it cold with tortilla chips.  People liked it so much that they filled up on it before dinner started.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Easy to make, really tasty.

The sauce on this dish is awesome.  I made some changes.  I didn't use chicken, used coconut oil instead of olive oil, and cilantro instead of parsley.  Instead of chicken, I sauteed red bell pepper, carrots, and cabbage.  I used 2 cans of coconut milk.  Once the sauce was finished, I spooned it over already cooked chicken.  Awesome!

smooth, tasty, and deliciously spicy and velvety.  I used chicken thighs and legs, added bell peppers and did not use turmeric (I didn't have it).  very good!

Other than spice on the chicken there was no taste to the recipe.   Thought coconut milk would add some flavour but there was no hint of it at all.  A lot of work for such a bland dish.  Tempted to delete from my recipe box.

My new all time favorite recipe!  My family doesn't like things too spicy, so I used 1/2 the cayenne and 1/8 of the jalepeno. It was the perfect blend of sweet and not too spicy, just enough. I am sharing it with all my friends.

When I first saw this recipe I figured it for 5 stars, it would be good as the ingredients just sounded like a great combination.  I'm rating it a 3 as it is edible.  A lot of salt helped after we began to eat it.  It's on the bland side, the spicy tastes barely come through. It's not too expensive to make if you have all the spices on hand.  I used top-notch Thai rice to put this recipe on but it didn't help much.  Sorry, I prefer to rate dishes highly, I don't rate many but take great care in those that I try and then later rate. And, it's not really Brazilian at all, seemed more Asian but that didn't really come through either.

I made this for my husband and me and it was delicious served over brown rice. Since we cannot handle too much spice, I only used one jalapeno and skipped the turmeric (didn't have any) and it turned out great.

Wow, was this spicy!  For me at least, I'm pretty sensitive to hot and spicy dishes.  I should have trusted my instinct to not put all of that cayenne in.  If you enjoy spicy things, by all means, try this!  Served with brown rice, fresh yellow sweet peppers, and fried plantains ("Tostones", from this site.)

Didn't like this at all. I did use lite coconut milk, but it has the same flavor as regular coconut milk. I also did not garnish with the parsley since my husband and I are not fond of parsley. The chicken itself was too spicy, and we like hot, and the sauce was bland at best. With all the wonderful ingredients in this I expected MUCH better. Will not be making this again.

This dish is delicious.  I  cheated and used frozen grilled chicken from Trader Joe's instead of fresh chicken.  Cooked the onion etc, then added the chicken and spices.  I added the coconut milk and simmered it all for about 10-15 min.  Served over riced cauliflower.  Definitely will add to my regular rotation.

It was delicious! I used coconut oil, cut the cayenne pepper in half (personal preference), and I don't know whether the coconut milk I used was light, but I don't think it was. (The can didn't say so, and it separates with a thick cream layer on top.) Otherwise, I followed it exactly and served it over rice.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this just tonight for the very first time and my husband was so excited and thought it was so awesome!!  It has a wonderful taste!!  You just need to add salt to taste!! The only ingredient I didn't have was ground coriander but other than that I followed the recipe.  It was easy to make too!! I will be making it again!!

Loved it. Try to make it when I can. I chop the chicken into bite size pieces and cook it like that with a heavier hand on the seasonings. Absolutely love it.

Made this for dinner tonight and we both loved it! I used canned diced tomatoes but other than that followed the recipe to a tee. The chicken was a little spicer than we normally like but the sauce helped to cool the dish down so I will make it the same again next time.  Hubby says definitely a keeper!

Great flavor. My better looking half doesn't eat curry, I do. Though this is not curry it's as close as I get to have at home.  She liked it, I loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

Very spicy, but good. I served it over brown rice and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also let the chicken simmer in the coconut milk sauce for about 10-15 min. before I served it.

I wish I could give it 4.5. Very good! I served it over coconut rice that I'd added pineapple tidbits to, a nice contrast to the spice.

Just ok....the chicken had great flavor, but the sauce was very bland, I even added fresh basil and fresh parsley. I used canned tomatoes drained. Maybe more garlic would have helped. I let the chicken simmer for about 10-15 minutes also

Very good and a nice break from our routine meals, pretty easy too!  I agree w/ the other comments on being alittle too bland but I agree w/ the person who mentioned use salt and pepper to taste.  I also only used a few dashes of cayenne pepper otherwise my children wouldn't be able to eat it.  Served over jasmine rice was delicious!!

Fantastic recipe! Didn't take long to make. I served my chicken with small, red, organic potatoes. I boiled them briefly and then pan fried them in the left over spice and olive oil from the chicken! When it was plated, it actually looked like the shape of Sourh America! Kudos!

Kitchen did smell good, but no flavor and I left the seeds in my jalepenos and added a tad more spice.  I'm from Houston, and well like it spicy and more flavor....I'd add more spice, but will not repeat the recipe.

This dish is really good. I will probably add salt and pepper to the spice mix next time. I would also salt the coconut sauce. Don't shy away from two jalapeno peppers. When you take out the seeds it takes away most of the spice. My 4 year old, 2 year old and hubby loved this dish.

This is one of our favorite dishes.  I cube the chicken to make it easier to eat.  Also, fresh coconut milk is much thicker.  You have to shred coconut and extract the milk in water.

This was my first time using coconut milk in a savory dish. Good recipe, i seasoned chicken w/ sea salt, black & garlic powder before I added other spices. Next time, I would add a little more cayenne b/c i didn't have any jalapeno on hand.

This was good, I followed some suggestions from previous reviews and diced the chicken. This recipe also needs some salt added to taste. I served it over baked potatoes with some cheddar cheese melted on top. It was liked by all.

Delicious with boned chicken thighs. Even with the cayenne and jalapeno cut in half this was very spicy...and we like spicy! Will cut back even more next time. Final sauce needed salt and a touch of sugar.

This was absoutley yummy! The only thing I could suggest is add some of the chicken rub seasoning into the coconut milk mixture. It gives it a more flavorful taste. I also served it over basmati rice. Next time I am adding pottatoes to make it last a little bit longer.

It was pretty good the first time around, but the leftovers were fantastic! I think the spices really melded together after sitting in the fridge overnight.

I accidentally used cream of coconut instead of coconut milk.. very tasty mistake! I used a single jalapeno, and served it over jasmine rice. It was delicious and I will be adding this to my list of things to cook over and over again. Next time I will cut the chicken into strips or small chunks, though, I think full breasts were just too much.

My family (including kids...age 12 & 9) loved this recipe.  I did half the cayenne and used only 1 jalapenos with seeds.  It was spicy, but the kids liked it enough to power through it (with milk).  Also, I cubed the chicken before coating it with the spices and returned the chicken to the coconut milk/tomato combo for a few minutes before serving.  It was flavorful and delicious!  Husband said it was Food Network quality :)

I forgot the ginger and the parsely  I tasted the coconut milk sauce and I didn't love it until I added curry.  I also didn't use low fat coconut milk, i used whole.  I added some cayenne but less than the recipe prescribes and it definitely had a kick.  My husband and I both enjoyed this though.  Sorry about the curry for you purists...but, it just made it taste way better.:) Next time I'll add the ginger and see if that helps.  I also added kosher salt to the sauce.

This was simple and delicious. I only used about half of the can of milk and it still turned out good (less fat). Instead of the tomatoes, I added a 1/2 bag of frozen veggies (thawed). More fiber. Wild rice makes this dish awesome.

okay.  When I came across this recipe, my eyes lit up with excitement.  I love all the ingredients, and would even nominate myself to be president of the coconut milk fan club.  That being said, when I made it, I was really disappointed!  It IS incredibly spicy, which I find to be a positive, but something was just off.  I used canned tomatoes, reserving the liquid just in case, and when it came time to serve, I did add some of the tomato juice for a little more tomato-ey flavor.  That could have been this dishes ( and my ) downfall.  I will still give it three stars for the recipe itself as I think its fabulous!

I think I was hoping for something more like Mulligatawny - this just was missing something, and too much cayenne as well.  Maybe I should have used more salt?

LOVE THIS SO MUCH! I have now made this many times and the following is my advice for changes. The first time I made it, it was fabulous, second time not so much...only because i didn't have minced ginger (used powdered...yuck), and ran out of garlic cloves...used powdered...yuck! SO...USE FRESH ingredients!  I also used a large can of diced tomatoes NOT DRAINED instead of fresh and the result was a fantastic, plentiful sauce! Instead of jalepenos I used a few pinches of crushed chili flakes...easier to monitor the amount of spiciness. I also cut down the cayenne by about half.  Remember to salt the chicken before hand and a add some splashes in the sauce...simmer chicken in it for 15 mins...served with COCONUT RICE...very very good.

This was very different, but good. I used red peppers instead on jalepenos. I think the jalepenos would have been better. I used ground ginger, and I acually blended the coconut and diced tomatoes in the blender and poured over chicken and rice. TIP: Use Basamti rice, it taste more authentic with it.

This chicken tasted awesome! The chicken by itself with the dry rub tasted great, and the sauce was also very tasty. The only changes I made was I put in 1/2 an onion instead of a whole one, and I omitted the jalopeno. I added salt to the coconut sauce and also pureed it in the blender to make it more appealing for my kids (I knew they wouldn't like chunks of tomatoes in the sauce). I will make this again!

I really really liked this recipe because it was faster to make than I expected and because it's something I never would have come up with on my own.  I used about 1/4 c of finely diced jarred jalepenos, which I think must be a lot more than 2 jalepenos because mine turned out really spicy even though I halved the amount of cayenne.  I used candied ginger instead of fresh because that's what I had; I also added 1 diced red bell pepper, some frozen peas, and served it with jasmine rice to make it a complete meal.  I think if I make this again, I'll try another user's suggestion of substituting basil for the parsley.  It reminded me a lot of the curry dishes from Thai restaurants that use basil and coconut milk.

YUM!! A real keeper! Tried VERY hard to follow recipe exactly but did a few substitutions. Used 2 breasts in chunks, no turmeric so 1/2 tsp curry instead, 1 jalapeno, diced canned tomato instead of fresh(no juice), canola instead of olive oil, found I had coconut cream instead of milk so diluted 4 TBSP with 1 2/3 cups water and skimmed milk. Added chicken back to veggies for about 10 min. and mixed all with coconut milk to simmer a while. Used the full amount of spices and shook the chicken chunks in a bag to coat leaving them sit for about 20 min. Garnished with cilantro instead of parsley. Spicy but with rice PERFECT!

I wish i had, had all the proper ingredients for this as i'm sure it would have turned out even more wonderful than the improvised version i used. For instance i had no tumeric in the house, so i left it out. Flattened and cut the chicken into one inch strips, as well as used only 1/2 a can of coconut milk, and added an extra tomato. After putting it all together i let it to simmer for a few minutes that way all the flavors melded together...
  This recipe turns out fantastically... at first i thought a few of the commbinations sounded odd, but trying it was definetly worth it..... so so yummy

Husband loved it, just kept saying it was a keeper but it was okay for me. I added more onion (Strips)to coconut sauce and marinaded the chicken for an hour. Also added at least a tablespoon of curry powder to add some spice to the coconut sauce. Used half a jalapeno also. Will add some more salt to taste next time. Was very good with the Brazilian white rice(One this site) and personal mango salsa. Parsley unnecessary. Was very good! Will make again for husband! Maybe use the marinade on chicken drumsticks on the BBQ next time and put the Coconut mixture on top of the rice on the side.

This is the second time that I have made this dish. The first time it was WAY too hot but I thought with a few changes I could get a dish that everyone could enjoy. I did not have Turmeric or fresh ginger. I omitted the turmeric and used powdered ginger. I completely omitted the cayenne since my Cumin is hot enough. I also stirred in a small can of crushed pineapple and used mild Rotel for the tomatoes. I also omitted the Jalepenos. Served over rice with a garnish of Cilantro it turned out edible & delicious for this family of Minnesotans. Thanks!

Pretty good- very spicy. I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces. I didn't have any coriander so I substituted dried basil. Next time I would cut back on the cayenne by half, it overpowered some of the other flavors. I also added salt and pepper and thought the dish was very flavorful. I served with Brazilian White Rice (also from this website) and it complimented the dish well.

This chicken turned out great! I added extra turmeric and cumin to the sauce. I also used canned diced tomatoes as I couldn't find nice ripe tomatoes this time of year. Rave reviews all around, thanks!

I was very excited at how robust all the flavors made this recipe sound, but this recipe was by far, not at all what it's cracked up to be. Everyone raved about how great the sauce was, but that was most horrific (very bland) part to me.I will never make this again. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for a great recipe, cuz this ain't it.

Was a little nervous about this one because I read a few reviews that people called it bland and tasteless. Well it was when I first tasted it...but I added salt while it was still on the stove and I served it over saffron rice. I think the addition of the saffron rice really tied it together. Turned out great.

I LOVE this recipe - except it is definitely missing salt. I usually put in aprox. 1 tsp and reduce the cayenne by at least half if I'm having guests who are weary of spicy-hot food. Got lots of raves from many different folks. Wonderful aroma!

The key to the bland sauce is SALT. It most certainly needs it to bring out all the flavours. I also cut back on the cayenne, as I was serving this to my kids. I only used a 1/4 tsp.  I served this with diced and roasted sweet potatoes. The combination was outstanding, with some of the sauce drizzled over the potatoes.  I had the leftovers for lunch today...and it was even better. This will be going into my recipe box for sure.

I don't know how it's possible for one dish to be both spicy and bland at the same time, but this one was both. It needs.....something. I don't know what. The chicken came out spicy and tasty, but I guess the sauce didn't really do it for me. I can't say how authentically Brazilian it is, since I've never been to Brazil, but it wasn't a curry, like a lot of reviews have said. I'd probably make it again, but I'd have to do some major tweaking with the flavor of the sauce for it to move up into regular rotation.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  I also thought I found the best chicken recipe but this one is definitely one of the best. It's also very simple and relatively fast done. I would also go for the rice instead of pasta. Enjoy!

This recipe was fun, it was better when I added flaked coconut on top of the plated chiocen. My only contention is that it is in no way Brazilian. Coriander, cayenne, turmeric, and jalapenos basically don't exist in Brazil. The presence of garlic, tomatoes and coconut milk are Brazilian.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I subbed fresh corriander for the parsley and added the chicken back into the sauce to suck up all that coconut taste.  YUM.

This was wonderful!  I used cilantro instead of the parsley, though.  Next time I make it I'll cube the chicken instead of leaving the breasts whole.  Made a double batch, froze the 2nd serving.  First time  I served it with brown rice, 2nd time was with whole wheat angel hair - was delicious both times.  A definite keeper!

This recipes was different, but very good.  I cheated and used canned tomatoes, but it was still excellent.  I served the chicken over basmati rice and it was a healthy, hearty meal.

Way too spicy for my family. I even tried to top it with sour cream to cool it off. Nothing was going to fix that mess. We ended up going to Applebee's.

Excellent flavor! The flavor was even magnified when I had it as leftovers.  After reading the other reviews I decided to use 1/2 of the coconut milk.  This gave it more of a sauce.  I feel it would be too soupy and water-down the flavor if I used what was recommended.

Though this dish takes a little time to prepare, it is AMAZING.  Spicy and delicious with the coconut milk.   Add a little rice on the side and your guests will gobble this up.  It's my favorite recipe I've found on this site!

With the exotic ingredients that made up this recipe, I was expecting a much more flavorful meal.  I was very disappointed in the bland flavor of the sauce.  The chicken was good, and very spicy, although I added a tiny bit more cayenne.  I probably will never cook this again, as I have found MANY recipes on this website that are much better!

I made this with less cayenne at the recommendation of others here, and I used 1 1/2 fresh jalapenos, but it was still far too spicy for us. Otherwise, it was delicious over brown rice. Nonetheless, we threw out the leftovers, which is very rare in our household. If I make it again, I might halve the cayenne and skip the jalapeno altogether. And, I'll eat with a cup of milk nearby to quell the spiciness!

I used skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I thought it was good, though not great. It provided lots of sauce, which was good over white rice.

I am not sure why I was surprised that this "Brazilian Chicken with Coconut Milk" tastes a lot like a Thai Red Curry: many of the ingredients are the same.  I am not sure I would make it again only because Thai Red Curry is so much easier. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Seemed scary in terms of spiciness, but with coconut milk it just has a slow burn. Used chicken thighs, fresh basil..served on a bed of cauliflower rice. Creaminess without the dairy.

This is a delicious recipe. I tempered the heat for our palate, cutting the cayenne in half, and adding baby carrots, zucchini, and a green bell pepper in place of the jalapeno. I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and used fresh basil instead of parsley, and canned chopped tomatoes in place of fresh, as that is what i had on hand. I will definitely make it again, maybe adding broccoli next time. A nice addition to quick, moist, stove top chicken recipes!

This was delicious. Be careful of the turmeric, it stains everything! Omitted the ginger only because I had none. It was still so good that we may just omit it next time too. I also added a squeeze of lime at the end. Served over rice.

Definitely a keeper. 
I took some advice from other reviewers and only used about half the cayenne pepper that was called for. 
I added some sliced red bell pepper with the onions, garlic and jalapenos. 
I had to use granulated ginger so I added that when I added the tomatoes to the skillet. I also added some basil and chives. 
Also added the chicken back into the sauce and put into a 400° oven for about 20 minutes to tighten up the sauce and allow the chicken to soak up some flavor. 
Served over rice with a side of grilled zucchini.

The items in the directions are not the same as the recipe.  So I just winged it and left those out.  No ginger in ingredients list

YUM!!! Added some Thai basil and lemon grass, reduced the cayenne and left out the jalapeño (sensitive hubby) and this dish turned out marvelous! Served over a bed of white rice with a side of broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

But I did amend the recipe to leave out pepper and hot spice. I used the cumin & turmeric, added bell pepper. It was pretty bland though. Thought it would be tastier.

Delicious! My family all loved it! The only thing I changed was to cut the chicken into cubes, so the chicken would be able to absorb more of the sauce flavor. Definitely will make again!

this is an excellent recipe.  just a warning that it is on the spicy side. you may want to cut down on the pepper for those who don't like too much heat.

Will definitely make it again. The only changes I made was I used coconut oil instead of olive oil because I was out of olive oil. I also use bone-in chicken thighs and fried them until almost done. Got the sauce and Pepper's going and then I threw the chicken back in covered and simmered for another 20 minutes. It was delicious needed a little salt in the end to taste. Definitely something you could bring to a potluck and everyone would enjoy it. I served it with white and wild rice blend. Everybody loved it and wants me to save it to make it again.

I followed the recipe closely except used 12 boneless thighs and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Oh and my jalapeños were the pickled kind. Simmered for 15 min in sauce to reduce and thicken. Found sauce was bland so sprinkled more cumin and salt to bring out some more flavours. Teens loved it, hubby and I were just ok with it. Served over basmati and riced cauliflower.

I have a feeling my rating is probably more a reflection of me than the recipe.  It came out OK, but I agree with another user that it was a little bland.  It needed something else salty/smokey, so maybe next time I might put some bacon in it.  I'm still learning how to cook at home, so it's possible I did something wrong, but I will definitely try to make it again.

We were making it for a catering event and it was a buffet item. The sauce was really delicious, but we had to dial it back on the jalapenos and cayenne pepper. They made the sauce way too spicy with the spiciness of the Turmeric coating on the chicken.  Overall , we we be keeping it as a buffet item.

I was really hopeful when reading other reviews but it was really lacking. The seasoning on the chicken was so good! for the chicken, 10 minutes per side is definitely too long (they were quite dry). The sauce was very bland. I stuck to the recipe - the only change I made was, I used 1 jalapeno instead of 2. I'm not sure how everyone else achieved such good results.

Made the recipe per the instructions with two minor changes - I cubed the chicken versus cooking the whole piece, and I added the chicken back to the mixture and cooked for 2 minutes before adding the coconut milk.  Served with Brazilian rice from this site.  Family enjoyed it.  Will make again!

I made it exactly as written and it was very good.  As other reviewers noted, it does taste like a curry (which makes me wonder if garnishing it with cilantro might be tasty!)  I didn't think the spice was too much, but we like spicy. I served it over rice, so it may have tamed it a little also.  I will make it again as it was flavorful and relatively easy to make.

This was wonderful! Made it as is, but used light coconut milk instead (accidentally). I can see that the regular coconut milk would have added an extra richness - but, all in all my family loved it!

I followed the recipe except I used only 1 jalapeños and 1/4 of the cayenne pepper. I used 2 chicken breast with bone. Also added the chicken back in the sauce at the end . 5 stars because the kids ate every bite. Next time I would like to thicken the sauce. I’m not a fan of thin sauces.

The flavor was too sweet for my personal taste. I guess when I think of Brazilian food, I think a bit more spicy. Lots of prep work for a not so stunning dish, in my opinion.

This recipe had a lot of potential, but, in the end, it was extraordinarily bland. I tried to rescue it using additional spice and salt, but it couldn't be salvaged. It was a disappointing dinner. It might be more flavorful if one substituted red bell pepper for the tomato., or better yet -- use sundried tomatoes.

Excellent recipe - easy and tasty.   I do think it needs a bit more flavor.  Next time I'll add lemon juice and zest, see if that's the key.  Also, I was concerned about the chicken cooking dry so I made this is my quick pot.  Sauteed the onions/garlic/ginger in the pot first, removed.  Then browned the seasoned chicken in the pot.  Added the onions back in along with 8 oz chicken stock.  Steam-cooked for 20 minutes.  Added the coconut milk and let simmer for 10 mins.  Perfect.

So much better than I had imagined. I thought I had coriander and cumin. Turns out I did not, so I substituted curry powder. It turned out well. This is probably one of the best things I have made recently.

I'd give it a 5 but I changed a bit. I did not have ginger root so I ground up some anise seeds. I used 2 cans of diced  tomatoes and a cup of chicken broth to give it more liquid. Due to the level of spice I figured it needed to simmer a while (1/2 hour) and so I braised the chicken (that's also why I wanted more liquid). I also used thighs and "whole" coconut milk. Super good, though. This is a keeper.

Replaced turmeric with paprika and didn’t use tomatoes (both because of what I had available) and served on rice...delicious!

This is very tasty, but quite spicy if the amount cayenne pepper isn't reduced. I used thin sliced, boneless, skinless chicken breast halves and tossed them in the mixing bowl with the seasoning prior to cooking. Doing so gave a very even coating of the spicy seasoning. I also used a slight bit more olive oil as I don't use non-stick pans. 

I would recommend adding a small amount of water when you first start up on the sauce as it will assist in mixing in the drippings in the pan. 

The next time I make this I will probably reduce the amount of cayenne by half and not add any black pepper.  I am not sure why some reviews said this had a bland flavore, mine turned out with a full range of flavores that aren't overwhelmed by the heat of the dish.

Followed the recipe, but diidn't have coriander, used more cumin as a substitute.  My husband thought it was a bit "too spicy".  Next time i'll use less cayenne.   I thought this was very good.  Served over zucchini noodles.

The flavors that this dish produces are spectacular. Along with the creamy coconut milk, the spices take on a smooth flavor. My husband loves this dish! Keep the jalapeno seeds in for more spice, and I used any type of fresh tomato I have on hand, cherry, Roma, etc. Doesn't matter, they are all good!

I agree with a few other readers, the taste was bland.  I ate it with a salt shaker in one hand and a fork in the other.
Chef John has a fish stew made with similar ingredients which was much tastier.

Thanks for the recipe - it's definitely a good change from a typical coconut curry chicken dish.  I made the recipe with some modifications - used chicken thighs with skin and bones, 1.5x the spices, used 1 jalapeno and regular coconut milk.  Did simmer the chicken in the sauce for about 5 minutes.   I liked the smells and colors as I was simmering the ingredients.  But once we tried it, we thought the coconut milk was overtaking the other spices and ingredients.  Will try again with perhaps just half the coconut milk and possibly some chicken stock.

Love it! It will be a new favorite.  Fast,easy and tasty.  I did not have a fresh jalapeño so I used jarred.  I also used less cayenne, it still had a bite but not too hot.

Amazing dish. I omitted cayenne pepper and jalapenos  completely since I have 2 very young kids at home who do not like spicy food . It was still delicious and had enough kick from fresh ginger to give it that extra flavor.  It became an instant favorite in our house.

Great recipe!   I halved it for me and my husband and had leftovers for today.  I used skin-on leg quarters, measured the 1 teaspoon cayenne , but ended up only using half (which was perfect for us) , used a can of petite diced tomatoes w/o salt instead of the fresh because I didn't have any, and used lite coconut milk which worked perfectly AND without the added fat.  I have to tell you.... it was better today!  I love that about this recipe.  I ate all of my serving, stuffed, and yet, still wanting more.    Is this what they mean by WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER?  It sure was the case in this dish!  I loved it!  Thank you for this recipe!

I followed Jennifer's cooking order suggested in her review, and that worked well for me. I did season the chicken before I added it to the onion, and I used fresh tomatoes. We found this dish very tasty, but not quite spicy enough. I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll increase the amount of all the spices, and leave more jalapeno seeds in there!

Definitely salt the chicken prior to rub. One jalapeño was pretty hot/spicy. Used regular coconut milk and glad I did since the sauce could use the extra body. I also before serving added salt to the finished recipe. Tasted GREAT!!

The sauce was rather bland. Next time, I will use half of coconut milk (or coconut cream) and half of Chicken broth, and would add some salt and pepper to the sauce as well to taste.  Adding a small amount of curry powder would work, I assume.  I just need a bit more flavor in the sauce.

I thought this was a bad recipe.  The spice rub is too pungent and no matter how long you simmer it, it doesn't mellow out with the coconut milk.  Would never make this again.

This is a great dish and I'll definitely be making it again.  Based on other reviews I did cut pepper in half and used diced canned tomatoes.  I also reserved about 1/3 of spices used on chicken and put them in the sauce when I added the coconut milk.  Served it with basamati rice and this meal was a huge hit with everyone.

This was amazing! Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. Like others, I diced the chicken then mixed it in the spices and cooked. I also added the diced chicken back to the pan after adding the tomatoes and coconut milk so it could stew in the sauce for a couple minutes. I used one can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes. I served over brown rice. It was perfect, I wouldn't change a thing!

I used whole coconut milk-not light and amped up the flavor by adding the chicken to the sauce mixture about 15 minutes before serving. Everyone loved it! I intend to try it with a firm flesh fish next.

I made this dish but omitted the tomato because my husband doesn't like them.  We both enjoyed it immensely!  I will definitely be making it again.  I was amazed by all the flavors coming together in one dish.

The chicken was a hit! my husband and I both liked the chicken. I didn't have coriander, so I doubled the cumin.
He did not care for the sauce though. I had to substitute many fresh ingredients for dry or canned. Perhaps would have been tastier if all fresh. Also I would make sauce ahead of time and let simmer or make the day before. it was better as left overs.

Loved this recipe.  Very flavorful and attractive.  I did make two changes:  used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of 1 tsp and full fat coconut milk instead of light.  I found the recipe in All Recipe and had not read any previous reviews.  Found it took a little longer for my chicken breasts to reach 165 degrees.  Other than that, the instructions and timing were right on.   I would definitely make this again.

It was very good.  I used almond milk instead of cocount milk because that was what I had at the house.  I would make it again.

I used half the cayenne pepper and 1 jalapeño. I probably could have used 2 of the peppers but I was afraid  it might be too spicy. Overall it was a great recipe with flavors that complimented one another. I served it with just plain white rice and a salad. I would definitely make this again.

I liked the depth of this dish but it was not appealing to the eye. Maybe adding the tomatoes at the very end would have made it pop more. It was tasty.

It was very tasty.  I added basil, extra ginger and extra garlic.  I also simmered the chicken in the sauce for 15 mins.  I used chicken thighs they have more flavor then breasts.  I did not use light coconut milk.  Also, I put in very little red pepper.

Made it as written except left out the jalapenos because I didn't want it to be too spicy. I also tossed in some chopped red pepper and broccoli for color. I toasted the spices and deglazed the pan with the coconut milk and let the whole thing simmer a little longer than called for, but the sauce never really came together.  It needed something--butter? flour? cornstarch?--to thicken it a bit,  meld the flavors, and add some depth.

Delicious! Easy to make and the flavors are fantastic. I cut the chicken breasts into about 5 pieces each. I also started with cooking the onions, garlic, ginger and jalapeño first then added the chicken and seasoning into the same large skillet before continuing with the remainder of the recipe. The recipe is saucy which is perfect to serve over rice. I think this would be great with any cut of chicken. I'm already looking forward to having leftovers tomorrow.

It is a good, simple dish.  The flavors are not so complex that anyone couldn't eat it, even relatively picky folks. I feel it could use a touch of lime?  For me, most of the heat came from the jalapenos, not the cayenne. I brined my chicken overnight to ensure that the meat stayed moist no matter what the outcome.  I used canned tomatoes because I couldn't get to a farmer's market to get good-quality tomatoes.

We loved the recipe.  Substituted 1 teaspoon of Chili Powder for Cumin and 2 teaspoons of paprika for the Cayenne.  Added 3/4 cup chopped red and yellow small peppers.  Served over brown  rice that had been spiced with Allspice.  Great combo with the coconut milk.

A nice spicy sweet flavor that was different than a lot of other dishes, which was nice. Needed to be a little heavier on the salt than I normally am, just to get the other flavors to enhance a little. Something I also did  was throw the sauce in the blender before serving to puree rather than have a chunky sauce. A matter of personal opinion, but loved it that way.

This was my very first experience cooking with curry and using coconut milk in a Savory dish. It was phenomenal.. And the smell was devine. 
I made exactly as written except halved the cayenne and only used 2 tomatoes (diced super small because husband doesn't like them). 
I also decided to cut my chicken in strip so it was more kid friendly. So adjusted the cooking time. My coconut milk took  a little longer to thicken, about 8 minutes on a low simmer. 
Served over jasmine rice, and enjoyed every bite of it! Will definitely make again, thanks!

We really liked this recipe but I can't imagine using more than 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper!  I seeded and deveined the jalapeños before chopping them.  I used chicken thighs because they were on sale but I also know them to be more moist and flavorful.  I agree with another reviewer to put the chicken back in the sauce and simmer for awhile to enhance the favor in the chicken.  I also agree it would be lovely to have the chicken cut up into smaller pieces.  It was quite juicy and we enjoyed it over rice.  I'll definitely make it again!

The sauce is bland. All the spice is on the chicken. Next time, I will bloom  an equal amount of spices in the skillet at the beginning of making the sauce.

Mmmm, delicious!! My pantry limitations required the following variations: I used 1.8 lbs boneless thighs, skipped the cayenne & jalapeños, and used chopped zucchini in place of tomatoes! I sprinkled a bit of ground ginger in place of fresh. Be sure to add salt to the sauce to your taste (I used about 3/4 tsp). I kept the sauce separate for each person to add their own. Yum!!

Boring and bland.  My only deviation from the recipe was to decrease the cayenne.  It was still plenty spicy for me, but no flavor.  Won't make again.

Delicious! The sauce was too watery though. I added some flour to thicken it.
I didn't have some ingredients so I made some substitutions:
-substituted parsley with cilantro/fresh coriander
-substituted jalapenos with green bell peppers (capsicum)

Great recipe. Thanks :)

This was amazing. I skipped the jalapeño, only because I didn't have any. I made the seasoning to the recipe but spilt it among two chicken breasts for Mr. and me. It created a spicy crust on the chicken that was absolutely delicious and made up for the missing jalapeño. Served with spicy yellow rice. Added cilantro to the sauce (because why not). The sauce was so good I wanted to drink it! Reminded me of Tom Yum. I saved the sauce and am determined to find something to put it on. Maybe shrimp. Or I'll just drink it. ;)

Excellent flavour.  I accidentally mixed up two recipes I was making and added 2 tsp curry paste to the onion mixture, but it added to the recipe .....made it slicy spicey but prevented any blandness.  Really good recipe.

We really liked this recipe. Nice and spicy and tasty.

I used a can of tomatoes in tomato puree instead of the fresh and cooked it a little longer to reduce the sauce.

I served with roti and cucumber and onion picked salad.

This was SO GOOD! Served it with lentils mmmm... I'm not good at following recipes exactly... So I modified to our tastes and things on hand (2 chicken breasts, green beans, sweet peppers, mushrooms, no tomato).  I coated and cooked the chicken, then used all the spices (doubled) again when I cooked the veggies down.  Seriously amazing.  The only thing I would change is to cut the chicken into chunks to have more flavor nuggets and cook the chicken faster (I'm a nervous chicken cooker.)

I was out of coconut milk, so I subbed almond milk and it came out really tasty. I did add some coconut flakes though, to try and recapture some of that flavor. It tasted really good .. makes me wonder how good it would have been had I just had the coconut milk to begin with!

I loved it!  I cubed the chicken breasts, and I did not have coriander, but I decided to add a little cinnamon. I served it with rice and added peas and served it with lime. Great stuff!

Followed directions right until the end & found the sauce very bland. My husband added 1 level tsp horse radish cream,1 TBS green pepper,garlic & pepperdew pasta sauce, 1 TBS Nando's medium periperi sauce. He did a side dish of sambles: 3 bananas, 1 large tomato diced,1/4 medium cucumber diced,6 TBS Mrs. Balls original chutney. He mixed all ingredients together. Delish!

Improvised a bit, summering away from all spices.  Used  Garam Masala instead of coriander, red pepper flakes instead of cayenne, canned chopped tomatoes and a bit of chicken stock.  Added chopped red pepper to onions and a few fresh Basil leaves.  I have learned this type of improvising works without spoiling dish.  Will use extra sauce with  cubes of grilled paneer cheese or cheese marked "grilling cheese". (Old Bedouin recipe available in cheese stores and some supermarkets) and baby Bella mushrooms instead of chicken.

Very good flavor as written. In order to improve, I think it needs a teaspoon of sugar and tablespoon of basil. The additions made it perfect.

Really good dish, went over well in my household. The only thing that I changed is that I added a cup of chicken broth when I added the tomatoes to increase the volume of the sauce (thickened with a little corn starch.) Served it over egg noodles with a Thai cucumber dish. Family was still raving about it the next day. Spicy and good, highly recommended!

I have never tried Brazilian food, but I must say that I love it now. The spice mixture really makes the chicken 'POP'! The dish paired wonderfully over a bed of rice along with a loaf of french bread.

   This dinner meal satiated my friend so well, that she had the best night's sleep in a while! She wanted the recipe right away. I'll be keeping this one for sure.

    I followed some of the users' recommendations and used boneless chicken thighs. Putting the chicken back to the sauce to simmer for 20 minutes added the final touch. We don't care for parsley, and used plenty of cilantro instead.

Thank you so much for sharing this awesome and savory dish!

This was so good... that I could have eaten the chicken without the coconut sauce.  I made a double batch and so I had to improvise a little.  It was a little too hot for some of the group I was making it for so I added 1/2 a can of sweetened condensed milk to tone it down.  What I have learned over the years is that hot foods are generally better the next day.  So, I made this the night before and put in a casserole dish and reheated.  The group absolutely loved it.  Even those people that don't like spicy foods, loved it.  The combination of flavors is great.  I did add a bell pepper for color and this is great over rice.

That is pretty close what I used to eat growing up, the only things I'd change would be the ground cumin, less spicy hot,use cilantro not parsley . I will try making the same but with shrimp and fish.

I just made this for my family.  It had just the right amount of heat so we could taste the coconut milk.  Loved it!  You can spice it up more if you wanted. But i will continue to make as printed, with the exception of cutting the chicken into smaller bite size pieces.   YUM!

I really can't understand the reviewers who said this was bland. It is literally impossible to end up with bland results if the recipe was actually followed. If modifications were made and the result was bland--that's another story (and not justification for a bad review). I still crack up every time someone completely changes a recipe and then reviews it (sorry if this is hard on your ego, but it really screws up the review system). I was very happy with this recipe, as written.

Absolutey delicious! Used canned tomatoes, less cayenne and two mild jalapeños from the garden.  Seasoned and browned the chicken and threw it in the slow cooker. Sautéed the onion, etc. And mixed it with tomatoes and coconut milk and poured it all on top of the chicken. Cooked on low 8 hours. Fantastic flavor! Thank you, MLYIN!

A lovely and simple recipe, I replaced cayenne pepper with paprika. I also added a slice of lime which works really well with coconut milk and is used a lot in Brasilian food.

This "Brazilian Chicken with Coconut Milk" tasted excellent. I should not have been surprised when the "sauce" tasted like a red Thai curry given that many of the ingredients were similar (onions instead of shallots, jalapeno peppers instead of Thai chili peppers, ginger, garlic, and coconut milk - no lemon grass or kaffir lime leaves though). The sauce was a beautiful salmon color with bits of red (tomatoes) and green (jalapeno peppers and parsley garnish). I deviated from the recipe by cutting the chicken into 1" cubes so that my chicken-hating husband would be less likely to complain since more of the surface area of the chicken would be browned (his preference). The spice mixture on the chicken tasted like hot version (cayenne) of a typical Middle-Eastern curry (cumin, turmeric, coriander). I also deviated from the recipe by stirring the chicken into the sauce (instead of serving the sauce over the chicken) which would obviously blend all the seasonings together. My own end result tasted like an Indian curry with a parsley garnish instead of a cilantro garnish. Although there are simpler curry recipes that taste just as delicious, I won't hesitate to make this one again and again. I really enjoyed it. Thank you MLYIN for sharing your recipe.

Super yummy. I did not have turmeric but it didn't seem to make difference. I served it over basmati rice. I also used canned tomatoes, and cut the chicken up to bite size pieces. I would use less coconut milk next time. Too much sauce

The first attempt of the recipe was quite bland. However with a few adjustments it can be great. I added a can of Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes and half a cup of cream of coconut instead of coconut milk. I also added some curry powder and garlic chile seasoning. I cook the chicken alone for about 20 mins then added rotel to finish. It was perfect heat with a hint of sweet coconut.

This went over well for dinner. It was is a "keeper" recipe. Thank you for the suggestions. I did sub the parsley for cilantro. I also halved the cayenne because I was afraid it would be too spicy for me (it was perfect for me), but for my husband I could have used the whole teaspoon. I sprinkled more salt on at the dinner table to taste. It is very similar to curry dishes. I can see how it might be bland, but I am hoping it's better the second day when all the flavors have had a chance to meld together. Regardless it's a dish worth serving.

I am not one to like salty foods, but this needed an added dose to up the from bland to delicious.  The heat is there, flavor is almost there, easy to prepare, so it will go on my fav list.

We love,love,love this recipe!! We sub ancho & chipotle chile powder (1/2 tsp total) for the cayenne. We also use a little adobo seasoning (1/4 -1/2 tsp) . We serve it over a baked brown rice (Alton Browns recipe) .. Freaking delicious ! We also have made this using chicken thighs, I highly recommend :)

This is my husband's favorite dish! I skip the olive oil and throw everything in the slow cooker. I use full-fat coconut milk (trust me, your tongue wants the thick stuff!) and chicken thighs instead of breast. Served with rice and sauteed greens, this makes an outstanding meal.

Odd combination of heat and lack of seasoning. Everyone ate it but didn't necessarily enjoy it. Will look elsewhere for a good recipe with coconut milk!

I make a very little change. I served with pasta and it was great!
No ginger and without coconut milk but with chicken soup powder with boiling water and was extraordinaire tasty. I don't use cayenne pepper, my wife don't love hot. She is hot along.

Very good . ..but spicy, and I left out almost all of the cayenne--just put in about 1/8 of a teaspoon.  We can be weird about tomatoes in sauces that are not spaghetti, so I just left them out and used red pepper instead--made for a nice slight crunch and flavor.  This is a very pretty dish and was lovely over rice.  I'd cut back on the spice for our household, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

this has become the most asked for meal by my 10 year old son. He even helps to make it! I don't use as much cayenne as the recipe states as it was a bit too spicy for the kids with the full amount.

made it mostly as written except used canned diced tomatoes and took a meat mallet to the chicken breasts and flattened them.  We'll be having this again!

My dish turned out very good but I did change some things to make it to my taste. Just 1 jalapeño e just two tomatoes. Add a table spoon of tomato purée. And let the chicken cook in the coconut milk for about 10 minutes. My hubby likes it a lot!

Easy & delicious. Served it without rice or pasta. Substituted canned chilis for jalepeno.  Also used ground ginger because I was out of fresh. Worked fine. Really yummy stuff!

I liked this recipe a lot. The spice mixture for the chicken was fantastic; really nice flavour. The only thing I would change slightly the next time would be the sauce. I think I would add a little less coconut milk than called for (found it tempered the spice on the chicken a little too much) and add salt here rather than to the chicken spice mixture. Other than that, awesome!

This could possibly be the tastiest dish I've cooked in over 10 years.  I substituted the Jalapeno with red dry peppers, kind of like Thai peppers and it gave it the nicest touch.    I added a cup of mushrooms as well to give it a nice balance and wowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!

This was great :)  I under salted a bit but once added it tastes wonderful.  I added boiled carrots into the sauce with the tomatoes too - will try cauliflower next time.  Thanks for a great recipe

Very delicious with a few modifications based on other reviews.  Used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, cubed. Used only one jalapeno and that was enough to give it heat but not be overwhelming. Added diced red bell pepper to the saute mix. Used a can of drained diced tomatoes and regular coconut milk and returned the chicken to the mix while it simmered and reduced.  May add a pinch of sugar next time to enhance the flavor. Great served over rice with fried plantains as a side.

This is not the recipe for you if you don't like a lot of heat...but if you do this is THE BEST recipe. I used a can of tomatoes and used some of the juice which toned down the coconut milk. Very tasty!

This was very good!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but thought the flavor collaboration sounded nice.  It was definitely different than what our family is used to.  It was a nice change from the same ol' meat, potato and veggie dinners!  I did add salt and pepper, and used half the cayenne, and only one jalapeno, and it still came out a little too spice for the little ones.  Great for reheating for lunch the next day!!!

Yum!  I followed the suggestions of a few fellow reviewers and used canned diced tomatoes, and used the ground ginger I had on hand which worked well. I didn't have turmeric so I left it (and its "cousin" saffron out altogether) I imagine fresh ginger would put it over the top.  I do recommend seasoning both the chicken and the sauce since we found the dish a little less hot than we would have liked.  Delicious and I'll make it again soon - with more spice!  ;) Thanks for a great recipe!

I was determined to find a recipe and follow it from beginning to end...this one wasn't bad for a recipe beginner like me...I took a few liberties...I made mine with chicken thighs instead of breast but it turned out just as well! Also, I used regular coconut milk instead of light. I invited some friends over and the whole thing was gone. Not bad!

My boyfriend wanted a chicken dish with coconut milk and I wanted something other then curry. I tested this out and he's still raving. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I tried a few other options and it still was great. It probably would have been even better if I had made it exactly to the word, but it was great!

Brilliant!!! Just made it and what complex flavours! Substituted the chopped tomatoes for half a tin of peeled, choppped tomatoes - worked just as well. Use normal coconut milk instead of light - not much difference in calories, but HUGE difference in taste...

Out of the ordinary -- exotic-- something different!  Enjoyed it very much.  Served with rice and a baked sweet potatoe to round out the flavors.

I made this for Sunday night dinner and the pan was basically licked clean! Even my picky brother loved it. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new and interesting dish.

This recipe was great--very flavorful, even without the jalapeno. I was cooking for 6 kids and their adults and wanted to make sure the kids enjoyed it. They did!

My husband lived in Brazil for a while and he really enjoyed this meal. It was a little spicy for me, so next time I will cut back on jalapeño.The chicken flavor did resemble curry, but we liked it!

This was outstanding.  Followed the instructions exactly.  The only change I will make next time is cutting the chicken in bite seze pcs after cooking,then add to the sauce before removing from the heat and simmer just a minuet, to soak up some of the wonderfull falvor.

We are in love with this!  I left off the cumin, and only had ground ginger, but who care?  It's not that difficult to make if you just stay calm and organized.  Served with fried plantains (from this site) and rice.

I quadrupled this recipe to serve to a large group. I saw many people go back for seconds. I chopped up the chicken into chunks, seasoned it, let it "soak in" for about 30 minutes and then cooked it. This helped to cut down on the time of individually cooking each piece. Since they don't sell fresh jalapeno peppers in my country I used thai green peppers and left the seeds in (we like it hot). Everything turned out really nice. Thanks! (The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that we were not huge fans of the tomato chunks)

Awesome. I tweaked the recipe to make it more spicy/flavorful as suggested by other reviews. Also added celery to the onion/garlic/ginger mix and cilantro instead of parsley. Turned out excellent.

I wasn't sure what to expect (with the combination of spices and coconut milk) but this was really good (and spicy)! I served this over rice and especially loved the coconut sauce, which I think was the best part of it!

Very nice combination of spices -I rubbed the chicken with the spices about 4 hours prior to cooking and also used canned tomatoes which made this recipe very easy to make after a day with the baby.

I was in the mood to try something different.  I had to modify the recipe based on what I had in the kitchen. First of all, I halved the recipe. I only had canned tomatoes, I don't have any jalapenos so I used extra cayenne pepper and, on a whim, added crushed red pepper.  I also added a little bit of curry powder, and I didn't have any parsley. I served this over rice.  So, this isn't the exact recipe, I'll admit, but if you stick to the basic idea, you can modify this recipe based on your own tastes. I like exotic food, and I felt this was a nice change, but probably acceptable for those who aren't so adventurous. The flavors of the spices and coconut milk are soooo good.  I will make this again.

Really good.  I would add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I reduced the jalepeno to 1/2 and would use a whole jalepeno instead.  Also, I cut up the chicken so this could be served more "family" style.

My whole family (including 2 young kids) liked this.  However I did make some modifications.  I left out the cayenne and jalapenos, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and topped it with fresh basil instead of parsley.  It really is more of a curry and the kids loved the sauce over their rice.

This is an ideal recipe for me.  I had most of the ingredients already in my kitchen, and only had to buy a couple of them.  However, the result is a completely exotic dish that it wildly different from anything I've ever made.

My advice is: if the hot ingredients seem like they will make the dish too hot for you, omit them!  I did.  

This recipe can be varied, believe me, I know.  I used chicken drumsticks.  I fried them w/the spices rubbed on them for 5 min. on all sides, then baked for 25 additional minutes.  I didn't have onions, so I added carrots and sauteed mushrooms. Everything baked together (after sauteeing) in a bubbling casserole dish.  I served it with sticky rice.

My point?  Use your common sense and take advantage of this great recipe.  Improvise and have fun.  I served this on New Years Eve for my husband and we were impressed at the authentic Brazilian taste.  Thanks, Mlyin.

There wasn't really anything "wrong" with his recipe -- came out tender, etc.  Flavor tasted very ethnic, and I liked that actually.  However, sauce was too spicy for our taste, and frankly, coconut-milk sauces always are too thin for me.  Guess I will have too start using thickeners for recipes using this ingredient, as I appreciate the subtle coconut flavor!  If I were to make this again, I would tone down the jalapeno, cayenne, maybe cumin.  Sorry 'bout that....

My husband & I made this last night after a long day at work.  It was quick and easy to make and tasted delicious.  I will be making this again, I even had the leftovers for lunch today.
