This is a fantastic bundt cake recipe.  It's possibly the most moist cake I've ever made and it got raves at a party I made it for.  The only problem with it is the cranberries are overpowered by the spices.  If I make it again I'll leave out either the cranberries or the spices.  The base cake itself is really great and I recommend this recipe.

This cake is really good and light.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is also good for you since it is made with olive oil instead of butter, and egg whites only.   Yet, you would not know this when you taste the cake.  By the way, I used light olive oil (not the extra virgin one) and omitted the cranberry and spices, and instead added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon lemon flavoring, and 1 tbsp grated orange zest.  It was delicious.  My revised name for this cake is "Mediterranean Orange Cake".  I also made a glaze using powdered sugar and some orange juice.

Very moist, mellow flavor.  Might add more cranberries next time.  A little dark looking.  People hesitated because of the words "olive oil", but when encouraged to taste a bite they all liked it.

This is an incredible cake, I am a new cook and this is the first cake Iâ€™ve made, it was so much fun. My Mom and Dad loved this cake, the sweetness and spices were just right for us, and I loved the occasional tartness of cranberry. I did make 2 changes, I used corn oil and used 4 whole eggs for more flavor, instead of 6 egg whites. I separated the eggs, adding the yokes while putting in the buttermilk. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over again.

Really tasty, not too sweet like some cakes.  I used "extra virgin" olive oil and didn't find the flavor too strong.  I also used the orange zest, plus lemon extract as other review mentioned, but still put 1/4 tsp cinammon in batter + the cranberries.  The cake tastes wonderful and looks great.  If you have a real sweet tooth, you might want to make a glaze for it, but I like it this way, myself.

This was a very tasty cake.  Like other reviewers suggested, I cut the oil in half and it turned out great.  It came out a little dark, so I'd start checking it at 50 minutes instead of an hour.  Thia was the perfect holiday cake!

I also omitted the cranberries (and cloves, since I only had whole) and used used orange zest and a tsp of Madagascar Vanilla as suggested by others.  I made it in a 9 in cake pan, and served it with fresh (unsweetened) whipped cream, blackberries, and strawberries.  This was even better than the same cake served at a local 5-star Philly restaurant.

Excellent taste and texture.  I tried out this recipe to get a healthier alternative to a butter/whole egg dessert.  I did substitute 1/2 tsp. ginger for some of the cloves (cloves are very strong and wintery for my taste).   I used a Spanish olive oil described as "fruity" in taste.   I will make this again with the blueberry option and serve it to guests!!!

This turned out great...but, I added 2.5 cups of chopped cranberries and only 1.5 cups sugar  Will try next time to reduce the olive oil in half and sub in some mashed avocado to replace it.  Spice amount as per recipe gave it a great taste and holiday scent.

Thanks  for submitting the recipe.  I made alterations. I omitted the clove. I did not think that I needed it. I added vanilla liquer instead of cloves. I used 1/4 cup of agave nectar to replace 2 cups of sugar. I just did not need all that sugar because I used 1 1/2 cups of dried cranberries, and 1 1/2cups of chopped walnuts.  It was too well done baking for 60mins. The next time I will let it cook for 45mins. instead, but a very nice cake!!!

This cake is really moist and delicious.  I basically followed the recipe, making only a couple tiny changes based on what I had on hand (subbed 1/4 cup of canola oil for olive oil, used less cloves and added ginger, used milk+lemon juice since I didn't have buttermilk, and left the cranberries whole).  I don't think any of these small changes were necessary -- the recipe is great.  This one is a keeper!

I was a little hesitant about using so much olive oil in the cake, but it tasted very good and was very moist. I used the smaller bowl of my mixer for the egg whites, and they filled the bowl up to the brim. Next time I will beat the whites using the larger bowl.
I did not put a glaze on it, and don't think it needed one at all. Everyone who had a piece said it was excellent.

Greasy!  Per other reviews, I left out the cloves and cut the cinnamon in half.  I still couldn't taste the cranberries over the cinnamon.  My daughter said it was a cinnamon cake, not a cranberry cake.  Mouths of babes, and all that.  Kind of a lot of work for not a great cake.

Super moist and the combination of the spices and the cranberries makes it perfect for the holidays. Wouldn't change a thing other than using whole cranberries (slightly more than a cup) for simplicity. I may mix up the batter a bit once in the pan next time, but no one complained that all the cranberries were in the top of the cake.

Added more cranberries for flavor and topped with orange glaze and found it to still be somewhat bland.  Needs more spice.

Made this with the orange peel and lemon extract, omitted spices. Used the orange glaze. A little tedious to make but a big hit at work.

This is an excellent base recipe. I'm a professional baker and I am always looking for and trying out new recipes. I usually try to stay true to the original recipe the first time I make it so I can give an honest review but in this case I did change just the flavor profile. I already have an excellent cranberry bundt cake recipe so instead of using the cranberries I used the juice & zest of 1 orange plus 1 tsp ginger & 1 tsp cinnamon. I glazed the cake with a simple orange juice/powdered sugar glaze & it turned out perfectly. The only reason I can think of that someone would call this cake greasy is that it didn't get mixed properly. I make bundt cakes daily and it's not unusual at all for one to take a full cup of oil or butter so a cup of olive oil should never produce an oily cake, simply a very moist one. This will go into my personal recipe book as an excellent base recipe because no matter how you change up the flavors you should always get a fantastic cake with these ratios.

This recipe saved me. I have to be on a low iodine diet so I made this cake since I could have egg whites and for the buttermilk I instead used Rice milk. After spraying the pan I also sprinkled raw sugar in it prior to adding cake batter. So delicious!!! Everyone at work loved it!!

This makes a terrific olive oil cake! I just wanted it plain so I omitted the spices and cranberries and I baked it in a springform pan. It's like a cross between a sponge and a pound cake. I love it, thanks for the recipe!
