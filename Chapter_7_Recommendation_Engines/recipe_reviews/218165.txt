Great tasting Dressing!  I served this with some peas over spaghetti.  I used my homemade peanut butter to make this.  I will be making this again!

I used this dressing for a cold asian noodle salad with chopped peanuts, shredded carrots, and green onions. It got rave reviews. I did sub white wine vinegar for rice because that's what I had and powdered ginger instead of fresh and it was fine.

Loved this dressing over a salad of mixed greens, red peppers, cucumbers, carrots, and some dry roasted peanuts for added crunch.  This would also be good as the dressing for an asian-style noodle salad. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was yummy! I like this on rice noodles. I used natural 100% peanut butter.

wow! What a perfect blend of flavors. It took me all of 2 minutes to whip this up. Even though I used dried ingredients from my spice cabinet instead of fresh (i.e. ground ginger, garlic powder, chili powder, dried cilantro), it was still amazing. I'm sure it's even better using the real stuff. I made mine gluten-free by replacing the soy sauce with Bragg's Liquid Aminos. This is definitely one I'll be mixing up when we have company and will also try it over chicken and noodles.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! it was amazing and had my husband and children going back for seconds (and thirds) of salad last night. The Salad I put it on was just plain baby spinach and other mixed greens. I topped with toasted almonds, just because its what I had on hand. I made a second batch today and added left over grilled chicken to the mix. OHHHHHHHHH so good! This should be a secret recipe but thank you so much for sharing!
