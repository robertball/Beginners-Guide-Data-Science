Made this tonight without the machine, just rolled out by hand for ravioli's. Despite my husbands doubt the whole family loved it! Hooray I can make my own pasta!!! Also I used regular old vegetable oil as i was out of olive oil. Was wonderful!

Easy dough to make. This is my sixth time making it and I got a little adventurous and added garlic infused oil, and it has upped the flavor. Great for first time pasta makers!

I omit the water and add an additional egg to add creaminess to the pasta. it always has great bite, and every now and then I add tumeric for a rich yellow color. my picky wife eats it right up.

I followed the directions as written and used the dough to make spinach/mushroom ravioli and it was perfect!  The consistency of this dough worked well with my KitchenAid pasta attachments--much better than the pasta recipe that comes with the gadgets!  Will use for all my homemade pasta recipes!  Thanks for sharing.

Amazing and easy. I added an extra yolk. Use the dough to make raviolis. Yummy. This is my new pasta recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I found this very easy to work with. The only change that I made was using "00" flour, just as I usually do.  Well, two changes actually, I didn't knead the dough, I never do because I let the KA do the work. I set the dial to #3 and put each portion through several times, folding it in on itself each time. I then set the dial to #5 and put it through once, then use the fettuccine cutter.Perfect pasta, thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe as written. With the Kitchenaid pasta attachment to flatten the dough. There was enough to slice spaghetti and linguini. Even my picky eating kids liked them! Delicious!!

Nice pasta recipe. Didn’t feel like getting my pasta machine out so I mixed, rolled out with rolling pin & cut into strips with my pizza cutter. Made great noodles for our chicken & noodles dinner. My husband kept commenting on how good these were. Thanks for posting your recipe.

I used “00” flour and it is as good as the Italian restaurant that inspired me to make my own pasta.  The “00” flour makes it taste more fresh and soft! My husband said he never had any pasta this good.

I used AP flour,  it worked well.  It was so easy,  I put all the ingredients in my mixer and it whipped right up!  I hardly needed any water.

I needed this to remind me of the proportions. I use the KitchenAid pasta machines. The recipe turned everything out to be perfect. For those of you interested in trying homemade pasta but don’t have a pasta machine try pasta rustica. Just make the pasta door rolling out as flat as you can and then roll it up and cut it as thin as you can and then unroll the pieces and boil them. You will be amazed at the results and people will be very impressed.

I have used a few different pasta recipes and this was hands-down the best and easiest.  I did use dill-flavored olive oil instead of plain and that may have made a bit of difference  but the general consensus was - A-mazing.  Thank you

This recipe is super easy and the pasta was fabulous. I always thought people who said homemade pasta tastes better we're making that up but now I'm a believer!!! I really can taste the difference.

What a great, easy recipe!  I love mixing the dough  bowl.  It is so cleaner and easier.  Also, the pasta (fettucini) took a little over one minute to cook in pre-boiling water.  It was per and delicious!  It was enough pasta for two generous entrees or appetizer portions.

Very easy pasta recipe with great results.  This is my new go to pasta recipe.  I used 00 flour, but I imagine AP would work just as well.  I didn't have time to let the egg come to room temperature and the pasta still came out perfectly.
