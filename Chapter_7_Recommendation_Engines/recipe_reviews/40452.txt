Delicious combination of flavors.  I've also made this by using crumbled feta and mixing the ingredients with whipped cream cheese.  This makes it more of a dip and tones down the intensity of the feta flavor.

Had something similiar to this at a party and loved it.  Found this recipe and served it at a wine and cheese party of my own and it was a BIG HIT!  Served this with a chardonnay.

Although it sounds unusual, this recipe was terrific!! I had some leftover feta cheese that I wanted to use up. Not only was it delicious, it is soo easy to put together.I used it with baked pita bread wedges My husband and I absolutely loved it. I will definitely use this again for company!! Thank you Ann:)

Haven't quite done this. Since I buy precrumbled feta I mixed honey with feta and added the pepper while mixing. DIVINE...I just love this combo of sweet and peppery.

Really good.  Took me a bite or two to really fall in love with this.  I only had crumbled feta so I just used that and it was a spread...will make again.

Tasty and easy to make. I think this recipe depends highly on the type of honey you use, I used the hard white clover honey, next time I'll try the regular one.

Fantastic!  Followed tips here and used a bit of neufchatel cheese to smooth out the feta.  Served with lightly salted pita chips, and ever single bit was eaten!

A really interesting combination of flavors - I think that the sweet/savory thing is not really my thing, but this dish is really heavy on the cracked pepper, so if you're not a fan, sprinkle ground pepper, sparingly.      I do love feta though, so I liked this, probably would have liked it better with just the honey/feta, or maybe by changing up the proportions.

I thought it was interesting.  Lots of flavor with just a few ingredients.  I took this to a party and there were plenty of leftovers to take home.

For me this was strange at first, then just ok, then I got tired of it quickly. I'm glad I tried it, but once was enough. Thanks anyway.

Made this twice this week, everyone loved it.  So unusual and so delicious and it couldn't possibly be any easier!  (I didn't use anywhere near to a cup of honey though.  Just drizzled it over the top and a little on the plate around it to make it look attractive.)

This sounds delicious but wasn't anything special - the feta didn't really stand up to the rich flavor of the honey.  Not bad, and quick / cheap for a party, but maybe it would be better served warm?

We thought this was very good! My only change was to cut up the cheese rather than keeping it in a whole block. We really enjoyed the the sweet, salty and spicy flavors in this. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great little appetizer. I had some feta and looked at things I could make with it, saw this and it was great. I just got a little block of feta, put honey on it, sprinkled some black pepper on it. Spread it on some crackers, tasted great. Even my 4 year old liked it. She wont taste hummus but she thought this was pretty good :)

Yes, you're right this does sound very odd,but it is very good. I used crumbled feta and mixed in the honey & pepper.I also hated the first bite, as did my daughter, but the more we tried, the more we liked. I put some on a cracker & then put a slice of oil-marinated sun-dried tomatoe on top, IT WAS AMAZING!!! This will definately be a great appitizer or snack.

I'm torn about how many stars to give this because my first bite I hated it but a couple minutes later I had another taste and then another and then I practically ate the enire thing. The pepper is the key. It's salty, sweet with a bite. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm gonna try it on some nice fresh whole grain bread from a local bakery. YUM!

This is my favorite last minute snack. I use crumbled feta and stir the honey in to make a creamy dip like spread.

Had this at a friend's wine party and had to come home and look it up.  It was wonderful and one of the first things to go.  Will definitely do this at our house for the holidays.

I really love salty and sweet tasting food items so this was a dream come true. If you don't like feta I doubt you would like this since it pretty much takes center stage. I used crumbled feta since that's call I had on hand, just topped the crackers with the mixture and viola!! GREAT!!

Absolutely loved this! I like feta in pretty much any recipe, but the bite it has is sometimes too much. The honey totally takes that bite away and just leaves the flavor! There's a slight kick from the peppercorn, but I didn't think it really added much. I will make again- even my husband loved it- but likely without the peppercorn. Served with crackers, crostinis and tortilla chips. Good on everything! I may even try this as a stuffed chicken filling.
