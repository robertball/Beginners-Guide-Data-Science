Delicious! Adults at my party loved it; kids, not so much. I used fresh-squeezed oj but I won't in the future--I don't think anyone would be able to tell the difference, and it would save $!

Made this for guests, and noticed no one cleaned their plate...all made same comment, which I agreed, strange after taste? Maybe i did something wrong, but won't make again.

I didn't make this into a "cake" with the lady fingers - instead I just made the filling and let it set up in little individual cups.  It makes a lovely dessert.  Next time I might choose to use a little more sugar - evidently my oranges were a little sour and so the result has a very strong tangy flavor.  It is good, but might be better with a bit more sweetener.  Overall we liked it a lot and will be making this again!

I'm noticing the  inconsistency in the recipe.  Ingredients call for 4 cups of OJ, but when you follow the steps I never cod find where you use but 2 cups.  Also,  the jello says 3 (.25) boxes of jello, but jello comes in 3 oz. Or 6 oz. Very frustrating.
