This is a great meal and quick to make. I use double the sauce and add generous amounts of garlic powder and oregano to the sauce when I mix it with the sausage. I also include a sprinkling of sliced black olives with each layer. This has become a favorite with my extended family and they always want me to make it for special occasions.

This recipe was great! I am watching my fat intake and made some ingredient substitutions:  italian turkey sausage instead of the regular italian sausage, low fat cottage cheese instead of the ricotta, and fat free mozzarella instead of the regular mozzarella cheese (I used only 2 cups of the mozzarella, I thought 4 cups was a bit much).  They only problem I had was not enough pasta sauce - I think a jar and a half would probably do the trick.  Overall, a great recipe that I plan on making again and again!

My friends and family loved this recipe.  It was delicious!  The only thing I would do next time is add a little more pasta sauce to help the noodles moisten up a little more.

How can you call this Italian? The filling should have ricotta, mozzarella, parsley, ground black pepper, locatelli cheese and eggs.

Made this delicious dish and my twin girls loved it. However, i added mushrooms and more onions for fuller taste.  You do need to add in more pasta sauce and mine was kind of dry. Also, the 45 mins oven time was not enough and had to rebake for another 5 mins before pasta noodles were soft.  Otherwise, the dish was really good and my girls are asking when they will be eating it again!!

I would advise to keep searching. This recipe was not good. There was only enough sause to do two layers. The recipe needed to call for more cheese and the worst part was because there was not enough sause, the oven ready noodles came out hard.

Very easy and good.  I used Newman's Vodka Sauce just for something different.  My family liked it, very cheesy.

This was the first time I have ever made a lasagna, my fiance' loved it and I was very impressed with myself! I used a roll of mild italian sausage and added a dash more fennel seed, four cheese marinara, baby spinach, sliced black olives and freshly sliced mushrooms. Lots of mozzerella and fresh parmesan cheeses! Mmmm, it came out sooo perfect! Add a green salad and garlic bread and you have a tasty Italian dinner. I will definately make this again!

I uses this recipe but I used a good brand of tomato sauce and it made the flavor really good. I didn't use Bob Evans sausage I used hot italian instead and it come out amazing. My family was surprised that I made such an awesome lasagna for my first time ever making it!

Loved this recipe! Made it for my brother's birthday and he did not believe his little sister was the chef.  I did use our own venison pan sausage which is leaner and has less sodium.  So yummy! It is now my only lasagna recipe I use.

This recipe was delicious and simple, and I think the Italian sausage adds a lot of the flavor and eliminates the need for other seasonings.  Delicious!

Well, there are a few issues with this recipe. For one, there is not enough sauce; you need about 2 26 ounce jars. I would also do at least 1.5 lbs of Italian sausage, or add half a pound of ground beef. Secondly, you need about 2 cups of ricotta, 2 eggs, and a cup of spinach chopped in the cheese mix; which can be omitted, but I like it for color.

I made this recipe with 2 jars of pasta sauce after reading other reviews.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp of onion powder & garlic powder to the riccotta cheese in addition to the tsp italian seasoning.  I only used 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, but would recommend using at least 3 cups to ensure that the lasagna holds together well. I found that the flavor really depends on the sausage and pasta sauce blending well together.  Try Prego Italian Sausage and Garlic.  My husband went back for seconds, so I say it's a winner!!!

I have tried different lasagna recipes over the years and I would not recommend this one.  It seemed strange that there weren't any seasonings listed and no egg?  But, I made it as instructed and it turned out dry and not very flavorful.  It needed more sauce and cheese, too.

This isn't a bad recipe - I just think maybe it would work better in a smaller pan, since you do run out of sauce before the top layer. However, it's still a good way to make a quick and easy lasagna.

This was really easy to make. To cut down on the fat, we didn't use sausage and used light ricotta. We also mixed some chopped spinach in with the ricotta and used italian blend cheese instead of just mozzarella. It was delicious!!

Loved this recipe. I did not use Italian seasoning or ricotta cheese. I used cottage cheese instead and added hamburger in addition to the sausage. My husband likes lots of meat in the dishes I cook. I just bought spaghetti sauce and did not use the tomato sauce or pasta sauce.

I am rating this recipe 5 stars because it saved me tonight for dinner. I hate going for a lasagna recipe that has 20 ingredients when I am trying to throw dinner on the table with the random stuff I have around my house. It turned out really good I added some water to my sauce which I always do with pasta sauce to help it go a little further and also I was always taught by my mom to run the noodles under warm water just to barely wet them before you put them in the pan and between those two things my lasagna was nice and cooked and not dry at all.  I'm going to save this one for another one of "those nights"

I would double the sauce and use ground turkey instead of the sausage. I also couldn't find 'no boil noodles' so I just used regular ones. For my first time making lasagna I think it came out really well!

Definitely add more sauce and instead of italian seasoning, I put cayenne pepper, montreal spicy steak seasoning and crushed red peppers mixed in with the italian sausage. So so much more flavor.

Easy to make, but needed much more sauce than recommended (I thought).  It was OK, but nothing spectacular.  I will probably still make it again just because it was so quick to make!  I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and a large can of tomato sauce.

It was good, my husband and kids loved it. I did change a few things. I put 2 cloves garlic in the pan with the sausage. I whisked 1 egg into the ricotta, and added some dried Italian Seasonings to the sauce. I also watered the sauce down a tad (about 1/2 cup water), b/c I didn't think it was enough. I think there needs to be an additional 8 oz can of tomato sauce added to the recipe, I only had enough meat sauce for 2 layers. But i will make this recipe again!

Not sure why others found this flavorless! Italian Sausage is loaded with flavor by itself.  I took some others' suggestions and added garlic powder and italian seasoning to the sauce.  Also used double the amount of sauce.  It turned out great.

Totally boring!!! Maybe a 7 year old would love it, but too bland for adult tastes.

Just joined and did a search for an easy lasagna dish just to see how everyone else does it on the quick.
Boy was I surprised to find the EXACT same recipe I use, down to the same brand of sausage.

I found the recipe in a local newspaper about 15 years ago and have used it regularly since then. Anyone who has eaten it has loved it.

The only thing I do at all different is the noodles. Sometimes I let them soak in hot water for about 10 minutes, sometimes I put them in the pan straight from the box. When using them uncooked they obviously need extra sauce.

By the way, I also cook a much more elaborate lasagna when I have time, but this one is perfect for those nights when my tired body says simple.

My kids loved this recipe.  I used a little more sauce and cheese than the recipe asked for and I cooked my noodles for it but it was a big hit and everybody loved it.

It's an okay base, I suppose. It was really easy, but seemed to be very flavorless. I'm not sure what would have made it better, sorry.

This lasagna is DE-Licious!  It was so good with the sausage instead of plain, ole' hamburger meat.  Aunt Becky liked it so much she asked me for the recipe.  And, it's a nice and simple lasagna...not a lot of crazy ingredients.

I made this last night and I don't even have the words to say how good it was! Yes, I committed gluttony, LOL but this is a recipe which is going into my box. 
Thank you for sharing it Bob. Leeflea.

This recipe is delicious.  It's now my husband's official favorite dish, and all he requests.  It could use just a bit more sauce, but perfect otherwise.

My husband and I both loved this!  I used more sauce than called for - about 1 1/2 jars to make it more moist as other people recommended.  Very easy and will definitely make in the future!!

Very easy and good.  I'd never made lasagne with sauce from a jar before.  With the cheeses you really couldn't tell it wasn't homemade.  I substituted a parmesan basil white sauce for the ricotta cuz I thought plain ricotta would be too bland.  I did add a chopped onion, 3/4 lb of sliced mushrooms & half cup each of wine & water.  Even with the increased liquid I needed to use another half jar of sauce.

It was alright, I've had better lasagna though.  I used turkey over sausage (just due to preference) and rice noodles due to gluten intolerance.   Even with additional Italian seasoning it still seemed to be missing something.  Somewhat bland.. maybe a spicier or more flavorful sauce would have helped.
