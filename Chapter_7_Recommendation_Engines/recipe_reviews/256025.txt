I was hoping for more of a "glaze". I think some honey drizzle right before the end would be wonderful. Otherwise, it cooked perfectly and was very tasty.

This was very good. I made it exactly as instructed and the marinade was SO TASTY! To create a little more glaze I brushed the salmon with a little extra honey in the last few minutes. I served it on garlic fried rice with a side of bok choy w/ oyster sauce and garlic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The flavors in this dish were great! It didn't give me the "glaze" I was looking for, but it was quick and simple to make. I didn't have to buy any special ingredients to make this at home. I followed recipe as directed. Good flavors!

Made it exactly like the recipe says. All we good until I added another dish into the oven with the salmon. So it says 6-9 minutes. That would be fine but my salmon was very thick and could have gone another 3-4 minutes. Other then the middle being a bit soft it was great. Try a little lemon zest towards the end and it pops great with the citrus.

I made this recipe last night for our dinner.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I  also added approximately one  teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest to the marinade, as well.   Yes, the marinade did add a nice orange-soy flavor to my salmon, but both my husband and myself felt that it needed something more.  In retrospect,  I  find that I don't want to change the flavor of that wonderful, fresh salmon with a marinade.  I like the flavor  as it is.   Instead, I'm going to try and create a sauce, slightly thickened,  incorporating the orange, soy, honey and ginger to spoon over the fish after it's cooked  and plated, and just before serving.  First I need to come up with one more ingredient to add more subtle texture to that sauce.
