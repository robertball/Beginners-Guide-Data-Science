This a a great and easy recipe.  I have made it twice, the first time following the recipe. The 2nd time I used wheat flour, fat free and sugar free pudding and cream cheese.  It still was great, my family loved it!

This was easy enough to make and serves alot.  I made the crust in my food processor which is a great time saver.  I wished the pudding had more of a lemon flavor and next time I might try adding some lemon zest.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
