This was wonderful, and my husband liked it as well, I put salt and pepper on the shrimp, because the recipe didnt call for it, and added a little butter too.  I didnt use that much cilantro either, maybe half, because i didnt want the cilantro to overpower it either. I added some more lime juice and some sliced jalepenos for a kick.  IT was great! Thanks!

While quite delicious overall, I found that the cilantro somewhat overpowered the other flavours, and the garlic (which was my reason for cooking this dish) was almost imperceptible. Next time, I'd try cooking with half as much cilantro, and not pre-browning the garlic so as to retain a little more of the punch.

It was okay. Even after I added some salt and pepper, I was still not too impressed.

Love these!! Perfect just the way they are. Chop up a head of garlic, add some butter and if you run out of tequilla like I did, add some spiced rum, LIKE I DID!! lol Broil a good steak and add a nice salad. Delicious!  Thank you Littlegrey.
