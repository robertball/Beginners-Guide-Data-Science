This is a response to a comment below: the eggs in a key lime pie recipe don't have to be heated because they are chemically cooked by the acids in the lime juice. It's like when something is smoked.. it's not raw, just not cooked with heat. I assure you, you're not eating raw eggs.

My father was adamant that TRUE key lime pie had three very distinct qualities, it was made with KEY lime juice, and not just lime juice, it was NOT green colored (sign of food coloring or geletin), and it wasn't smothered in whipped cream.  This recipe is exactly how I remember this pie from his kitchen and from our trips to the keys.  Delicious!

This recipe is great and authentic. Steve's key lime pie of New York does not ship their pies because of the difficulty of doing so.  They instead recommend a 5 ingredient recipe (they don't give one) which this is. The two ingredients for the shell and the three for the filling.  The recipe does need to be followed and the ingredients need to be fresh - no bottled or frozen juice.  Any lime other than Key lime will give it a different flavor and not congeal the eggs and milk properly.  Also, it does need to be kept refrigerated in order to keep it reasonable solid.  Real key lime pie will not be solid if left at room temperature for more than an hour.   And yes, the eggs are cooked by the citric acid.

I have not tried this particular recipe but have noticed that many recipes for key lime pie are not baked.  How can this be when there are raw eggs in the recipe?  I used a recipe on the back of a bottle of lime juice.  It also said refrigerate..no baking necessary or bake for 15 minutes at 350.  I baked it and it was great.  Also used a graham cracker crust and fat free eagle brand condensed milk.

Come on, people.  Don't say a recipe is bad when you don't even follow it in the first place.  LIME JUICE IS NOT KEY LIME JUICE!

This is like substituting maraschino cherries for whole tart cherries.  You might get lucky and save the dessert, but you're not making the dessert you picked.

This recipe is a standard, real (yes, it's not fake just because the ingredients are few) key lime pie recipe which makes one standard, real key lime cake.

Tips for people who are worried about their cake surface being lumpy/get lumps in their surfaces: hold the pan in both hands after pouring in the filling and gently shake horizontally to flatten it.  Also, overbeating this will give you little bubble craters in the surface.

Good luck!

I used 3 egg yolks and 1/3 cup key lime juice. Set up very well after a couple hours in the fridge. I made a meringue with the whites, beaten til stiff peaks then beat in about 1/2 tsp lime zest and 1/2 cup sugar. Spread the meringue on the filling taking care to stick the meringue to the crust all the way around [or it will shrink back from the crust where it wasn't touching], sprinkled a little more zest on top and baked it in a preheated 275 degree oven for about 20 minutes.

I only gave this 4 stars because there is a better version (in my opinion) that's similar but uses 4 egg yolks (not 2) and 1/2 cup bottled key lime juice (not 1/4 c).  Then bake it @ 350 for 15 mins to firm it up.  Let cool and serve with whipped cream.  Everyone I serve it to says it's the best key lime they've tasted.

I made this with bottled lime juice to save time. Absolutely don't do that if you make this recipe; it wasn't good. It might be better w/real key limes. However, the pie filling was runny (I did use the two egg yolks). I won't make this again, even with real key limes. The best part of the pie was the mountain of Cool Whip we had to put on it to make it palatable. I recommend trying recipes for the real key lime pie. This was a waste; I'm glad I didn't make it for company.

Good, but bf complained it wasn't limey enough and I increased the lime to 1/3 cup.  I made a key lime pie about 3-4 weeks ago with the recipe from Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice and we liked it better.  It is very similar, except it uses 3 egg yolks, 1/2 c key lime juice, and is baked.  I'm inclined to agree it was better than this one, although this one is perfectly nice as well.  Worries about whether or not lime juice cooks raw eggs aside (and I do believe those who say it does), you can use pasteurized egg substitute and not worry about it either way, which is what I did.  I didn't have any problem with this setting.  It is a bit runny still but I think any key lime pie without gelatin is going to do that.  I used the Mock Graham Cracker Crust from here and it worked well with the key lime filling.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is AUTHENTIC, tart and custardy, non fluffy, non gelatinous, non whipped cream slathered, non chiffon KEY LIME pie.  For this to turn out in all it's KEY LIME tartiness, you absolutely must use Key lime juice...the two yolks is fine...an even better version I try is with a gingersnap crust made thusly: crush 32 crisp Gingersnap cookies in a plastic bag, add 1/4 granulated sugar and toss; pour in 1/3 cup melted butter and toss again so all crumbs are coated and turn out into a pie pan, pressing the crumbs up the sides and then flattening out the bottom.  Proceed as normal with the KEY LIME juice/sweetened condensed milk/2 egg yolk mixture and bake at 350 for 15 minutes...  The Gingersnap crust is to die for, paired with the tartness of the lime.  Now my family requests this dessert everytime they are in town.

To make the pie, I always add 4 (rather than 3) egg yolks with the 14 oz. can of sweetened, condensed milk and beat the mixture until it approaches the fluffy stage. By hand, I then mix in 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed key lime juice (rather than 1/4), and I fold in a couple of tablespoons of the key lime zest. Without fail, the lime taste is distinct and clear. I make a deep dish graham cracker crust, and after adding the filling, I bake it at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes.  I chill the pie in the refrigerator overnight, as I find it much more refreshing when served cold. I've tried this recipe...but I like mine much better. :-)

I have made this recipe using fresh key lime juice and it is absolutely delish.  After this key lime pie, I can't go back to the ones with gelatin and meringue.  The only thing is, this one doesn't set perfectly and will be slightly wobbly.  So I agree that this is not one to serve to company; this is one that you'd make and it all by yourself.  =)

This was so delicious. We followed the recipe, omitting the egg yolks (only because of time constraints).  It was light and refreshing, perfect for a hot summer evening.

Easy and simple and when ever I make it I have to make two otherwise my whole family complains. I tweaked it a bit: bake at 350 for about 10 min./ or until little pin holes appear DO NOT LET IT BROWN, add key lime zest-this adds just a little more flavor, after it sets up my family and I prefer to have cool whip on it so I cover the entire thing in a layer of cool whip, if you want a really nice contrast (green to white) add a little foo coloring

I did as one other person did...3 egg yolks and increased lime(not key)juice to about 1/2 cup just about. i also used a reg. pastry crust. and topped with meringue snd baked for 10 minutes or so till browned before cooling and chilling. It wasn't the firmest pie, but it sliced just fine and it was delish. Everone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe base

Great recipies are usually the simple ones.  (I do use 3 eggyolks and extra lime juice --Whatever the yield from 1/2 pound of FRESH limes and sometimes make meringue with the whites.)  This is the same recipie I've always used for Lemon Ice Box Pie (with FRESH lemons, of course)--- Another southern favorite. I love all things citrus and usually add zest from the fresh fruit.  Key limes are only available in my area for a short time during the year.  Today I read the label on the one pound bag of key limes I bought at Fresh Market this week.  "Coated with vegetable, petroleum, beeswax, and/or shellac based resin to maintain freshness"  Uhhh..... No thanks!  No zest in this pie!

I liked the consistency of the filling but 1/4 c is not enough lime juice, imo. I also used 5 egg yolks and next time I will double the juice, with the original recipe I could barely taste it. I like a good, tart pie! Also, whenever I make key lime pie, I always make coconut macaroons with the egg whites! No waste. :)

I used bottled lime juice and it DID make it not as firm as I would have liked but the taste was still really good! I also added black raspberries to the top of it , as you can see in the picture, which was a great idea! It added a lot of extra flavor!

I have not made this particular pie although for those who worry about the eggs being raw the lime juice cooks the eggs. It will also cook raw fish or shell fish.
