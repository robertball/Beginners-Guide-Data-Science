This was really tasty and full of flavor! I made the recipe exactly as written, except I added the cheese in the last 10 mins of baking. The herbs and mustard provide a nice bunch of flavor, combined with the tangy lemon and sweet cherry tomatoes. I served this with rice and sauteed green beans. Start checking the chicken before 30 mins, as mine was done around 22-23 minutes.  Pound the chicken to an even thickness of about 3/4" before starting. This will go into my regular rotation and is impressive enough to serve to guests!

I made this almost exactly as written, I misread the Ingredients and ending up getting spicy brown mustard and no spices so I used the mustard and an Italian mix. I added green beans to the bottom of the dish for added veggies. My only suggestion is cut slightly thicker pieces of cheese if using spicy mustard because the mustard is over powering. All in all it was a great dish that my husband and I loved.

This was ok, not as good as I anticipated. Nothing wrong, just nothing great. Not sure I would make again.

We thought this was really good and we love the cheese.  The fresh herbs were a little overpowering for our personal taste. Be careful not to cook the chicken too much in the skillet because it will cook for 30 minutes in the oven.
